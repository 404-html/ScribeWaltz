Speaker 1:          00:00:02       And we're live. Dave Rubin trying to shut this fucker. Shut that fucking thing off for two seconds. We're here to celebrate the fact that Chris Christie got kicked off of a quiet train this morning for talking on his phone while drinking a McDonald's strawberry shake. And this is the guy who wants to band pot about band yourself. You fucking Slob. How dare you. How dare he drink a McDonald's strawberry shake in public and have everything. Not only that, after having a stomach stapled. Yeah, it, it didn't really take. Yeah. You know, it's just those bitches out. You can do. You have to do saying you think he's doing something. I just keep eating. You just keep piling through. I know a guy was blown through two of them. He's had it done twice and blown through a both times. So you actually like tear open the staples like is that I, you know, I haven't done any Mris operations on these people.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       We are going to go heavy medical stuff today, but it's been explained to me, Dave Rubin, the skin is flexible and if you just keep stretching that bitch out, it's clearly when these people, like I have a friend and his friend, his friend of mine as well, but a good friend of his and he was about, he's about to go do this and I said, please try to talk them out of it because you don't need surgery. He just needed to change your life because the surgery is only going to fix the physical aspect of it. There's a reason while you're stuffing all this sugar and fat and you're just. You were addicted to food, so you need to find out what it is, what's going on. So you're talking about the psychological. I think that's where it's really at. I don't think it is the physical thing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       I think the physical thing is a manifestation of a psychological issue for sure. You get physically addicted to shitty food. Like I quit sugar recently. Shouldn't say quit sugar because I had a little this weekend, so I don't. I didn't quit it, but I, I removed it from my primary diet and I quit it all together for two weeks and what happened to me five days in was really shocking because I had a massive headache like five days in. The cravings were freaky and my head was killing me and it's like snapples and protein bars and low fat milk. There's all this shit that has sugar in it. You think of granolas healthy and then I would look at him like 20 grams of sugar in a serving of grunt and I usually have two servings. You look, it's not even sugar. What we do, we do in America, we do high fructose corn syrup to illuminate you on this, but in our coke and our can of coke, because it's cheaper to put corn in it, to sweeten it. We're drinking corn instead of sugar. That's why people get Mexican cokes. You know what I mean? You go to a fancy restaurant here in la, they give you a Mexican coke because that has real sugar. Think how just warped our whole system is the core thing. We can do five hours on corn because corn is, you know, it's in, it's in wallpaper, it's an everything to mazing and you know, you're trying to get off sugar, but what you're really trying to get

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       off his corn, there's definitely that as well. Um, but I, I think, um, even just simple sugar, so like even like I read this one thing, it's like a, I forgot what the product was, but it was one of the ingredients was pure cane sugar. Like you're selling me something amazing. Pepsi now, pure cane sugar, like holy shit, sugar, it's still sugar, but it's still. Your body doesn't necessarily differentiate. It still shows us salt, you know, like, that's, that's how dumb, that's how dumb people have become about food. We were talking a little bit about food before we started, but like it's really, it's like the most important stuff, what you put into your body so that then you can function on this earth. And we are so warped. We got corn instead of sugar even just now. So I, I told you I drank like 17 coffees before, but I didn't put any.

Speaker 2:          00:03:49       You have Stevia and everything. I just went straight, black, nothing. I've been drinking straight black lately too, but it's actually, you know, uh, think this Guy Peter Giuliano on at one point who's a real coffee expert. And uh, when you talk to a guy like that and you talk about putting cream into coffee, you could see his face like, what are you doing to him? It's, it's a sacrilege almost. So what would, what would you say to drink it? What's the best way? Just black. That's it. And I've been drinking a black. I actually prefer it in a method that this Guy Rob Wolf created, which is you mix it with grass fed butter and mct oil. The problem is for a podcast that gives me phlegm and I stopped in the middle and it's annoying as fuck for people that are listening, but it's pretty delicious. It's very good.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       Yeah. I still do that, but I just don't do it before podcasts anymore. So I did it. I did it for about six months. I was doing the grass fed butter and coconut oil. Just take a teaspoon of coconut oil and it's amazing and you feel great and it's delicious and all that. But I did over the course of about six months, I probably gained like eight pounds from all the butter. It's, it's a lot of calories to be plowing and morning, but he does do some good things. I think it has something to do with how the caffeine actually ingests into your body. It slows it down so you don't get that burst of energy crash and all that, which was all great. But you know, eight pounds in six months. That is a lot to gain. Most people, adults, their appetite and your appetite.

Speaker 2:          00:05:14       Um, no, not really. I don't give up. I live in West Hollywood. I, there's a certain amount of working out I have to do and not, not Joe Rogan level, but you know, uh, it's uh, just to stay in the neighborhood. Just certain them out. Have you ever been to Santa Monica in the middle of West Hollywood? I live in the gay place on earth. I've never seen so many daisy dukes. It is. It really bought well, first of all, I'm considered morbidly obese by these people's standards because they starve themselves. I don't understand people listening. Dave Rubin's a very slim and slender and fit. So the thing is, these guys, you know, it's, the gay is placed on earth and these guys work on their bodies all day long. You should not be carrying

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       a dog. They carry their dogs, these relapses and all this other man. Your bicep shouldn't be bigger than your dog. You know what I mean? That just shouldn't be, shouldn't be care. I have a pimple. She's not, you know, my bicep snapped bigger than her. I think that's a healthy way to do it. But yeah, in West Hollywood, these guys, they start, I don't know how to. You Starve yourself and have huge muscles. I just don't. The steroids, steroids,

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       that certainly helps. You can. There's some stuff that fighters had been caught with that. Uh, I think it's called. There's one called clenbuterol and another called the nausea. No, I think. And the idea behind any of that stuff. The cleanse I think is supposed to like really just lean you out. It's a bodybuilder thing and this allows you to keep mass on or helps you assist you in keeping mass on when you cut weight. So for fighters that are trying to be like the biggest in their weight class right there, dehydrating themselves, but they want to keep as much muscle mass as possible.

Speaker 3:          00:06:52       Yeah. That can't be good for long term health. Right. So bad for your body. I mean I see it with these guys and it's like, you know, they're doing this just so that they can get somebody that has a better body than them so they can fuck. And then they move on to the next day. It's like this endless game. You know what I mean? Like I got a hot body, he's got a high body. I'll fuck him now. I moved to like, it's just this climbing this ladder. Yeah. It's like Icarus, you know what I mean? You're just going up and up and up. But one day this thing is just going to blow up in your face. Yeah. But you know, that could be a second.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       If you look at life like life is this temporary trip, right? You have maybe 50 years of people actually wanting to have sex. You if you're fucking so lucky you take care of everything. So that's like from 18 to like when you're closing in on 70, everybody fucks. You was just doing new charity

Speaker 3:          00:07:41       and that's the saddest. That's the sadducees. These you, I see this, these overly tanned hair plugged guys that are 70 years old and they're still at the gym hoping that that 28 year old is looking at them and instead they're staring at everyone and gawking at them horribly. It's all grow. It's really sad. Or we can get into this a little later, but it's also shows me why the gay marriage thing was so important because these are. I actually have a lot empathy for these people that I can, you know, it's easy to make fun of, but like if you couldn't ever enter a relationship that then you're going to build like what you have with your wife where you can build a life, you know, and you can have kids and move forward in life. Well then if all you have is just fucking, you just keep doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       You not as many guys as possible rotations, different ones texting you all day long trying to put it together. Yeah, I mean, but figure out when you get squeezed the time,

Speaker 3:          00:08:34       you know, and it. Exactly. And I guess you know, it feels good in the moment, but for the longterm health of just like what being human is

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       not so great, but I think you know, interestingly, interestingly enough, if you look at the perspective of like a full long life, like it's just a bunch of moments just to like trying to maintain happiness and a certain level as much as possible. And you could be Chris Christie where you're addicted to Mcdonald's shakes and being a fat slob. The sausage sandwiches now can advise too much ego. He doesn't listen or you could try to fill yourself up with that and you know, be married and have kids and have that part of your life achieve normalcy. Or You can do the Super Tan roided up Dick Suck and rampage that, those guys that workout at like Gold Gold's gym on Cole. Do you know that? That's by. I don't know that one, but dude, when I was on news radio, we used to work out, uh, we used to work at sunset and gower that was the studio and Gold's gym was right down the street.

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       So sometimes we'd have off like two hours during the middle of the day where they had to rewrite scripts or stuff like that. So I'll just shoot over to goals, get a workout and then come back. But it is the fucking gays, Jim. It's not, it's, it's a ferocious disco is what it is. It's just a bunch of men with scrunchy socks on timberlands and like super short shorts and just to tightest tank tops. And you walk in there like a wounded antelope just gingerly stepping close to the waterhole. But how did you feel there? Because you're, you're in good shape but you're in good shape, right? Like you care about your body, right? You're doing the right things, but you go in there and you see these guys and you, you does it completely. Like, Oh fuck. Like I'm a fat fuck. No, it wasn't that at all.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       I was, I was in my twenties when I was doing that. This is one, I was on news radio, but I was. I was fucking being targeted. Like that was the problem. Like guys felt like you could have 20 pounds on the bar. Guys like I'll spot you. Like I don't need to spot dude. Get your fucking balls from above my head. Like they would literally, you'd be on the bench and dudes would just put their dick above your head to grab the bar. They just wanted their Dick in proximity with your face. You know like when you're doing bench presses, they can literally bench press with their Cox. This was pre Viagra to. You got to think because this was in the nineties, these poor bastards were going on in the match and when it went bad then the coc pumps and w was the liberace movie with Michael Douglas behind the candelabra.

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       Yeah, they have. They used to have implants, I guess back in those days. Those poor guys. I had no idea we were going to start like I didn't either. That's the beauty of this show. Let that bitch run for us a brief moment. Not, not entirely because I can defend myself, but I felt what it was like to be a woman that was pursued by men because men are fucking gross. Yeah, well that's the thing. It has nothing. It has nothing to do with gay or straight. It's a man thing. So if you happen to be a man into men. Yes. Well congratulations. You just got welcome to that world and were treated like a woman. So I have great sympathy for women that have to deal with this shit. I got treated like a woman with a gun, like, you know, like Oh, okay. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       Relax. Because I wasn't vulnerable physically because I was like stop. Yeah. And then it's two dudes looking at each other and I'm like, you know, come on man. Get the fuck Outta here. It wasn't like a woman who could physically be overpowered by this guy. It was like a guy saying, I'm going to kick your ass if you don't stop trying to fuck me. Like stop. Were you always amazed at their relentless, relentless tenacity to never take a acu Joe Rogan into it and they can never take the cue, right? Yeah. Well it's only a few guys. Most guys would figure out that you were straight and they were respectful. The vast majority, but it only takes if there's 300 guys working out at the gym, it only takes two guys to fuck up the entire experience. Less than one percent and they'll just do it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       But those are the ones that are just like, they're going to go for it, but how, you know, there's probably 50 other guys they're trying to work their way into the friend zone, which is what women experience would. Women experiences a bunch of guys. I can tell you, especially when I was younger and I was single, how many fucking girls that I dated who would work with some guy who would say, well, Mike from the office says this is. This is a much trying to fuck you. Fuck you. He's not even a real person. He's not even a real person. Mike's wearing a Kabuki mask and he's doing a fucking dance. It's a mating dance. That's not what he thinks. This is bullshit. Stop it. Meanwhile, I got to go to the gym and deal with that Mike, because Mike is Jesus, but that's what I mean.

Speaker 1:          00:13:17       It's there's a reason why there's 7 billion of us because this, this drive to procreate and not even on a conscious level. It's not like, oh my God, I have to get this girl pregnant and have a baby. It's like I got to come inside her. You know, I have to come. I have to figure out how to get this person touched my body and create pleasure. You don't take. You don't take the, the, the objective steps to recognize, oh, this is a gigantic biological trick that's been set in place by nature because it was really hard to survive just a few thousand years ago. It was insanely hard to survive and you had to make sure you meet as many people as possible so that they made as many people as possible. So we can keep this retarded party going on. That's what it is that the end of the day.

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       That's what it is. And that's why it keeps getting dumber. I'm sure you've seen idiocracy you're not. I honestly haven't seen it. I've only seen clips of it, but I had a bit that people accused me of stealing from idiocracy. But luckily I did the bit before idiocracy came out. So I got. I got grandfathered in. That's the comedians dilemma when you're doing good shit. So that 10 years later everyone's like, oh, you must have stole that. And you're like, no, no, no. I did that 10 years ago. Well, it wasn't that close. It was just the concept that many people have had is a dumb people or outbreeding smart people. Then that's the, that's the movie mine was that explained the pyramids. My thing was that the idiot pyramid workers would show up one day and go, uh, I was supposed to get my chuck on Friday. Where is everybody? But all the smart people figured out how to build the pyramids had already died and that we had. So the people just moved into the pyramids, like why we live in these mud houses, we can live in the periods. So they moved into the pyramids and pretending they built it and it's this long thing that sort of explains

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       what's going on today. And I think that we all think at a certain level that that's true, that there's way more dumb people in there are smart people and then we all think that we benefit from people like Elan Musk and innovators and geniuses. But how many of them are there? Not many. Not many. Not many. Tiny, tiny number. Yeah. Well listen, I, uh, I just got gay married like a month ago. I love what you say, gay marriage. Well, first off, people don't believe that I'm gay. They just simply don't accept. Why don't they accept it? They didn't say I don't act gay. I play sports and I don't, you know, like, I got this at the gap, you know what I mean? Like I'm not getting, like ever comprehend Fitch and get assaulted with that smell that they zap you with when you walk in there.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       You know, it's funny, I know that smell a, I used to be afraid when I was closeted, like in high school and college because I didn't come out until really my mid to late twenties, but I used to be afraid of Abercrombie and Fitch because they used to have those shirtless, you know, like these shirtless hot guys standing outside and I felt that they could, that they would know, like I just thought like these guys are going to know that I'm standing outside the store. Yeah. Oh you don't remember that. Like even the stores at the mall, they'd have just these shirtless guys all, you know, they are all perfectly Tan. They all look perfect and they would just be standing there greeting you. And to me it was like this. Yeah, it was like walking into a porn. So I was afraid that they were going to like read gay on me. So I never, I'm not kidding. I don't think I've ever bought anything from Abercrombie. I've been there many times, but I'd never seen never.

Speaker 2:          00:16:24       What year was it that they did this? They were for a long time. They were doing this probably in the mid to early two thousands. Yeah, I know. I probably didn't go to Abercrombie and Fitch until the mid two thousands. Maybe they were phasing it out, you know, it's really interesting. That started as a hunting and fishing supply company. Yeah, like void. They fucking make a turn. And then that guy, you know, the guy who runs it, who's got, he must have body dysmorphia. So there's this guy up Jamie. He's the one, I don't know what his name is. He's the one who, uh, he really instilled this idea that everyone there has to look perfect and look the same sort of. And that's why they've had all these lawsuits with people that are either a little fat. They couldn't get jobs there or I think there was a girl who wanted to wear a hijab or all that stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:17:08       And, but if you look at this guy will pull them up, got so much fucking work done on his face because he's just close to what you said before. He's like expressing his own weaknesses and he's projecting them onto a generation of kids and he's also expressing his own confusion externally. Whether you realize, I mean, look at that guy like he's had some serious shit. Sixty one year old CEO. We don't need to say his name says dude a lot. He'll say, oh, this is salon.com. First of all, fuck, fuck, fuck you. I'm down with that fucking creeps. Frauds just aggressively shitty and I don't fight those fucking headlines. Those tweets I had done following because I was like, this is such epic Shit and just such dishonest trash like a Dave Rubin. Why he's everything that's wrong with gay people. Taglia. Exactly. You would get those kinds of articles and just twisting and distorting your real positions to make social brownie points to appeal to the hardest of hardcore, aggressive social justice warrior lefties.

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       Can we get everybody to hate everybody? Fucking split everybody down to just their color and their sex to the point where you can then control everybody because if anyone gets out of that little box, there is something wrong with them. Got Something wrong with you. Well, this poor guy, he's not hanging in there. Well, like Robert Redford, that motherfucker's going in there. Well, yeah, he's hanging in there. Well, he's obviously an old dude, but it doesn't look like a monster. Yeah. Like I was at, um, my kid has a gymnastics class and there's this poor, unfortunate woman who goes to this gymnastic class who, uh, she looks like she's quite wealthy. She's always dressed very well, but she's gotten what I call monster face and monster faces when they shoot their face up with filler and then they do the lips and then they pull their face back.

Speaker 2:          00:18:55       So they have this sort of reptilian mouth. Mouth is way too big. It's way too big. Pull on this fucking skin. So the opening of their mouth doesn't match a normal person's face because it's bigger. It stretches like this guys, Chris Christie stomach pulling it, it gets bigger. Being skin is flexible. Think how deranged. Really like the idea of that. You know, these people care about what they look like, right? So they want to look better. So they go in that first time, they get a little botox or they get wrestling or one of those filters, whatever that is. But think how the course of that changes the way they think about everything to the point where that woman probably thinks she looks good. You know what I mean? That's, that's an adventure in the psyche, right? I mean, it's the same as bodybuilders. It's the same as people with Anorexia.

Speaker 2:          00:19:43       It's the same as the guys we were talking about before. You know what I mean? They just, you just keep doing it. No matter what you do, you take off your shirt, you look in the mirror and you go, this should be a little tighter over here, you know? And the woman's looking at her, it's always the upper lip. That's the women. They get fat for this poor lady that I know that had her lips done and every time she talks to you that she's got a scar like inside of her mouth that's like, it's her lip, you know, it's like it. There's a line. So like the lips never moved correctly. Like Lisa Rena, is that her name? She had that thing removed right as she, she, she was the one that had like the crazy, crazy, crazy lips and I'm pretty sure about a year ago, uh, she had something taken out or some filler or something. But I get it though, man. I had hair transplants when I was in my twenties and didn't take trig. Definitely didn't take. Not Anymore. I had a joke about it. The joke was it's like taking really healthy people and moving them into a neighborhood where everybody's dying. It's like we try to repopulate. Chernobyl,

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       you thought you were gentrifying the front, but in the end you just killed more people? Well, you know what it is, man. You keep losing hair. So worked at first like, oh yeah, the parts that it was falling out. I filled in. We're good, but you're not good. You key, it keeps, keeps [inaudible] up. So you did the thing where you actually cut out. Oh yeah. Wow. They cut a strip out. How long did you let it go before you gave up and just said, well I had it done and then it's slow. It was just slowly giving up and then there's also things you can do, like you could take Rogaine, which kind of keeps it in, but how funny is it when your name is Rogan and you go into buy Rogaine? That's, that's ironic. Just for that reason. Well you probably shouldn't have been on it because it was just dealt with it, dealt with that, but I'm like if it works I don't give a shit.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       And it did kind of work. And then Propecia, which works really well but also kills your tick. Yeah. So you got, you got a lot of. Lot of options. I did. I was on probation for about six months, about maybe seven or eight years ago and I couldn't get a boner. Yeah, it's a boner killer rather than like, I can fully say that, but now that I shaved my head, I actually like it way better. It's so easy and you don't get kidnapped by people that are cutting your hair because uh, I used to cut, get my hair cut by this lady who I love dearly, but sometimes I'd be in a rush. She would hold me hostage with these fucking stories because she'd be holding the scissors and then I told her, you're not going to fucking talk to me like that. And I'd be like, oh, it really interesting.

Speaker 1:          00:22:15       Cut My fucking hair so I can run, cut my hair so I can run away. So basically you shaved your head because you didn't want to listen to this bitch? No, she's not. She's not big. She's my friend. I love her. But your stories are terrible, but it's not even that. It's just, it's something to not think about. It's like all of a sudden when I shaved it, it was like instant freedom. Like, Oh yeah. And I use the back of my head as a public service announcement. Like if anybody's thinking about getting a hair transplant, I'm like, look at my head, let's see the scar. You don't want one of those, then it's not the worst thing in the world. Let me get this straight. Can you swim? Because I always see in the commercials when they get the hair, suddenly they can swim again.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       It seems like they couldn't swim. They had lost the ability to do the breast stroke. The wig commercials are the same. And the commercials, they're always underwater just like fucking crazy. So you're telling me you can still swim. It's not as good. I'm a little sleeker through the water, so it's confusing, but timing is off. It all. It makes no sense because the, you see the Olympic guys, they were the cap. So then it makes it seem like they're bald and they're swimming well and yeah, you watch those commercials and then they have a head of hair and they're swimming well. So it's a very confusing. I think the idea is that if you get in the water, like instantly all the work that you've done with hairspray to lock this fucking monster and place it all evolve, dissolves with the water and you'll leave behind an oil slick. But, uh, when you, uh, when you get in the water with one of those wacky wigs hair club, jammies, when the idea is that you can, nobody can tell, nobody can tell. Now I know you have theories on things. Do you have a theory on hair loss? Was it stress related for you? It's just

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       purely a hundred percent. Genetics is dihydrotestosterone. Your body produces a derivative of testosterone. DHT causes your hair to fall. I don't know why it exists in humans. It's a strange thing and why it exists in some and not others, but they're, they're like really close to fixing that apparently with just like some sort of a pill or a rub, but that'll probably cause cancer or blind in one eye. You have diarrhea and all that shit. Every pill we take causes 20 other things, you know, you know, I really think that they need to start. They need to show us when they talk about the pill, whatever pill it is, you got restless leg syndrome, you got what is that? Your legs can't stop because that real build art is a funny bit. I that like, you know, because we sit all day. It's your body like revolting against you, like get the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          00:24:34       I wonder if like joggers get restless leg syndrome, not because they're actually moving. Yeah, I mean that would be really interesting to study with. Jamie, you're a runner. Do you ever get restless legs? You do. You got the late. My whole life. You get restless leg but you've run a lot. While I was moving my legs over here feel like they need to move. I don't know. Wow. Oh, I'm not sure. I don't. You think they should have to show like when they show you the pill and they and then everyone's running in a field. It's all that bullshit marketing nonsense, but then they'll say I could cause suicidal thought they should've show someone going through suicidal thoughts or show somebody having diarrhea. Like they keep doing this, but the guys running through a field having a helped show me what it's like dos commercial death show a guy walking down the boardwalk just dropping dead.

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       You know what I mean? Like why are they allowed to do that? It's such mixed messaging. You don't understand what you're getting yourself into chantix. You're going to stop smoking. You might drop dead, you might, you know, explosive diarrhea, whatever it is. Like show me. Yeah. That's one thing if you're advertising a car, right? You know, you've got like the newest Cadillac and it looks cool and you drive and you look cool. Driving like, man, I want to get one of those. That's sort of okay, but if it's another thing, if it's some crazy you meant, you remember there was a drug that they were selling for a while. They were advertising that was a supplement to your current antidepressants. Oh, that was like an bill, a fly or something like that. Was that the one with the cloud? The cartoon cloud that was following the guy?

Speaker 2:          00:25:59       I think it was because if you have a cartoon in cloud, you've got some serious problems, but there's something fucked up about advertising for something that's a drug that can affect your mind and possibly cause suicidal thoughts because advertising is entirely designed to coax you into buying the product. Sure. And that's a big life to say. Ask Your doctor about it and that you shouldn't be allowed to say that. You shouldn't be allowed to say it because then every first off, everybody's on prescription drugs. I'm not on any prescription drugs right now. I have been for about six months also around the time I was on Lexapro or one of those mild kills your Dick to. You got a double whammy. It was getting kicked. Punched. Well, he's back. He's back. And better than ever. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       success. But I was on one of those and when I, when I got off, I know you're supposed to tell your psychiatrist or whatever because they'll ween you off it. But I was like, I didn't like the guy and I was like, I'm just going to get off this thing. He didn't like the psychiatrists are keeping shit from them. I didn't like. His last name was Ruben, which is why I went to him and then I just didn't like them and I was like, fuck this. I'm not going to do it. But anyway, uh, I just figured, all right, I take, instead of taking one a day, I'll just do one every other day and then one every three days, something like that. And it worked. I weaned off if I kid you not, I swear to God this is true. I remember when you used to turn on an old computer, like an old desktop computer, all the worrying and the buzzing and you'd hear the hard drive spinning and all that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:27:24       I could feel that in my brain for about two weeks when I got off it. Whoa. I felt my brain actually resetting or something like literally a worrying there was like. And then like little sparks. Was this when you were thinking or anytime? I just remember I lived in New York City at the time. I remember very vividly one day I was walking down in Amsterdam and I was maybe a week out and I felt my brain like just coming back on. So that shit, it does something to you. It does something and forget. And the boner stuff, and you know, all that I had of the reason I got off it actually was because one of my best friends, childhood best friends was killed in a car accident. And uh, when I heard I had almost no reaction is one of my best friends from four years old and I just was like, I was sad, but like I didn't have a sad reaction, you know, like I knew it was sad, but my reaction was and said, and then I was like, all right, that's it.

Speaker 4:          00:28:19       That's tough. It's a terrifying thing to remove the lows. Yeah. All the lows. The lows are there to teach you. Yeah. I mean, you gotta learn, you gotta learn from failure. Failure is important. It's an and, and, and feeling bad is important. It's, it really is because it makes, it, makes you understand and appreciate the magnitude of feeling good. I like it. It draws you towards that as a better alternative. Sure.

Speaker 3:          00:28:44       And especially as an artist that someone that speaks and is supposed to have a full set of emotions, I'd be able to go on stage, tell people what I think,

Speaker 4:          00:28:53       you know, that's the argument with school shooters. One of the things about school shooters is a massively disproportionate amount of them are on. And the idea is that they can do that and you know, the what is, for what, you know, what came first, is it the disease, the mental illness that causes them to be able to shoot somebody in the first place? Or is it the fact that they're on pills? Is it the fact that they're on pills because they're mentally ill? Who the fuck knows? But people that I know that have been on various antidepressants, Ssri is whatever they, they tell you that things don't bother them. The. So if things don't bond, like shooting people, like the lack of empathy. Like it seems to me in my armchair psychology, you know, position that that would just be a correlation there. Well

Speaker 3:          00:29:40       it's always why we have a real

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       inability in America to talk about two things at once. That two things can be true at the same time. So like when you look at the shootings immediately, the people who are against guns will say it's about guns and the people who are for guns will say it's about mental health. Pretty sure two things can be true at the same time. Absolutely. We have a mental health problem and we have to easy access to guns. I'm a hunter. I'm pretty sure your second amendment right. Yes. Yeah. I'm, I believe in the second amendment we should be able to arm ourselves, but it is still too easy to get guns. You shouldn't be able to necessarily have a assault rifle to plow down 30 people. It was all that. Um, but at the same time, yeah, a huge percentage of these people are on some sort of medication.

Speaker 2:          00:30:26       That's not a coincidence. Not all men, if they didn't have something wrong with them, no matter how many guns you had access to your, your, uh, your, uh, relatively same guy, no matter how many guns you have, you're not going to shoot a school, right? Yeah. So that says, yeah, there's some mental health component to this. Well, I think it should be really difficult to get a car to. I mean I think it should be get difficult to get a gun. I mean in, in so as they should do some sort of background check. They should. They should evaluate whether or not you have any competency whatsoever. Have you. How much have you learned about shooting a gun? And that's not the case right now. I mean the other problem is there's so many guns out there that the people that are doing this shit, like this last guy in Oregon, I think he didn't get the gun.

Speaker 2:          00:31:04       It was his mom that got the same results. I can get a gun even if even if you shouldn't be able to get a gun that is an issue, but we should make it more difficult. And the mental health aspect of it as a huge problem. And to say that it's not that it's only a gun issue is, is a blind thing that people do. Yeah, I think you're right. I think there's, there's a bunch of different issues at stake here and I think that's the case with a lot of different things and that's one of the problems that I have with like the idea of a left and a right. I think I have a lot of left ideas, almost all of them, you know, and then I'll have a few right ideas I have. I'm on sort of both sides of a lot of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:31:41       Yeah. Well I definitely want to get into that with you because that's become like my, my home now. This is really the split on the left between what I'm calling the regressives and people that I think really stand for liberal principles. That's all on the left. But yeah, I have some good. I have a lot. Look, comedians in general I think have hugely strong libertarian leanings because you want to be. I'm a firm believer that the government should have very little to do with our lives, make sure I don't get shot, which they're not that great at that, uh, you know, take care of the economy, keep us safe. Like that pretty much is what I think the government's role should be. That's it. That's about it, you know, make sure we have a good education system. The road should be okay. You're like pretty limited stuff. And I think usually for some reason comedians do fall on that scale. You know, Chris Rock is there a bill Maher, this, a zillion comedians on that side of it. Um, but I've seen a massive split in the left right now and this goes to all the social justice warrior shit and everyone's a racist and a homophobe and it's fucking exhausting. And it's a,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       well look, you've had Sam Harris on a bunch of times. Look what these people have done to Sam Harris. It's insane. They're just using him as a target or that's what I believe. I believe that instead of looking at his actual positions and being objective and saying, does he have a point? What is his point? Let's debate the point. Let's, let's debate the merits of the point. Instead. He's a guy that you can point to and say he will. He has a strong position about Islam, so he is Islamophobic. He is there for racist and he should be attacked and fuck that piece of shit. And I mean I've seen the same written about Christopher hitchens. You know, I saw some people when he died that were running good written, so I made fun of this one social justice war because he was saying good riddance to Hitchens, but then when Osama bin Ladin died, he was like, I'm not going to celebrate the death of any human being like, well, this is fucking hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:33:30       This is. Yeah, I know what you're doing. You're not thinking. You're not thinking you're, you're writing things. And this is part of the problem with social media and I think one of the things that we're finding with this whole social social justice warrior issue is that it's not necessarily just opinions. It's opinions that are being expressed in a way where they know people are going to hear it. They know people are going to see their writing and so that that knowledge that someone's going to see what you're writing and react to it either positive or negative effects your choices. It's like reality TV and what they're doing is like when you see people act fake on reality TV because you know that they know the cameras are on them. That's what you're doing when you make a retarded social justice warrior tweet, you're a hundred percent right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       So I know someone, I can't get their name, who right now is pretty big in their reality space on a reality show right this second. No, the very well. And he says to me all the time like that's what he's doing. All he's doing is ramping up to stay on the show to keep the whole thing though, of course. And that's what these people are doing. So Sam, how many times has he been here at least twice, right? Horror, four or five. Four or five times. So you've sat with this guy for hours and hours with this guy. Do you think he's racist in any way whatsoever, but he's. You know what he is, he's fearless. Yes. And, and I'm not saying he doesn't have fear of normal consequences of, you know, whatever danger. It's not that, it's just that if he has a principal who express it and I've, I've disagreed with them about certain points, of course, his, his principles and his opinions are, he will truly express, express them.

Speaker 1:          00:35:06       And in unpopular subjects, like when you're talking about Islam or you're talking about religion in general, I mean, he takes a tremendous amount of heat about that and he only gets it for Islam though, right? Because that's the truth of it. Like this is a guy who wrote a letter to a Christian nation. Guess what it was about Christianity. Nobody called him a Christian. A phobe, right? So when Bill Maher, so that night then the whole thing all hell broke loose with athletic on unreal time or heaven. Heaven broke loose, right? Exactly. Uh, whatever you want to call it. Some imaginary bullshit.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       Um, that night. And I know we both talked about this at time, but what happened was athletic immediately went to the social justice warrior. I'm holier than thou, I'm going to portray, protect the downtrodden thing, right, and it was nonsense and bullshit. Sam Sat there. Again, you can disagree with the premise of what he says. You can disagree with his feelings on profiling or nuclear first strike, but he'll debate all of those. I sat with him for an hour and a half and he would have done three hours, but our crew guys had to leave. I mean, this is a guy who will stake out these positions and unpopular positions and put them out there and they just want to shout him down and what the. What the real thing though is it's the chilling effect on that. Is that what? It's not about shutting down, Sam. If Sam disappears tomorrow, I think it would be really bad for our discourse as a country and I think this is a guy saying important shit, but ultimately guess what? They're going to come for Joe Rogan. They're going to come for Dave Rubin and they're going to come for all the other people that are tweeting about

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       and what they're really doing is just trying to take the moral high ground. They're trying to teach you some more shit of being like. First of all, if, if Ben Affleck had a real nuanced and objective position, he certainly didn't express it on that show. You mean racist, racist. He's a fucking idiot. It really is a fucking idiot.

Speaker 3:          00:36:54       You know? I don't know that I can go see that Batman movie because he, I, he has turned me. I love superhero movies. Love them. With that. The

Speaker 1:          00:37:00       fact that he was willing to take that position on a show like that and argue with that without, without. I mean, first of all, I like Bill Maher. I think he's a very funny comic that show socks. This is. This is why I like it a lot. It's like socks. It's doesn't suck because it's a sucky show. It sucks because all these subjects are massively important and have a bunch of people shouting over each other. Like here, like you and I have very strong opinions and we want to express ourselves and there's only two of us luckily because it was, if there was five of us in the room right now and we're all talking, it would be really hard to fucking get your points across because you've got to kind of like jump in and, and, and this is what happens when you get a guy like Sam Harris and a guy like Ben Affleck and Ben Affleck, which you're saying you're so racist, right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:42       So racist. Right? Instead of having an hour to go, okay, well why don't you tell me why it's racist and give me your thoughts in the Middle East and tell me what you would do about, you know, x amount of people who are so entangled in their ideology that they want death upon people. They wish death upon people who leave the religion. Yeah. Tell me what you would do about that. Tell me what you do about people that think that it's wrong to have women go to school. Tell me what you would do about. We're talking about ideologies. You can call it Islam, you can call it the moonies, you can call it, scientology, can call it whatever the fuck you want, but what it really is is a rigid set of ideologies. It's these are ideologies that you are forced to subscribe to a predetermined pattern of behavior and thinking, and if you are not in that predetermined pattern of behavior and thinking they wished death upon you and they think that they should be able stone you. If you're a homosexual,

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       they should be able to stone you. If you're an adulterer, there's a horrible video online of this poor woman whose father throws the first rock. I've seen it. Have you seen it? I've seen it. She wants to touch him before, before he kills her and he, he won't touch her hand and he hits her with the rock. But think about the absurd. So there's, there's so much here, right? So thinking about the absurdity of this, that the hatred for these people, the hatred for Sam, for Bill Maher. So whether you like them or not, when I say it sucks, what I know is that the constructs, all those talk show format suck those splitscreen, but bill o'reilly things bill talks and three experts shot. We'll be right back. It's just not enough time. I look, Bill Maher loves Bernie Sanders. Obviously he had them on the show last week.

Speaker 2:          00:39:18       He only had six minutes with. That's crazy. Imagine what year you would do with that guy. If he was here right now we could. We could literally talk all day and he should and he should and should have a show like that where it's just bill sitting down with these people and not being forced into that fucking soundbitey type of conversation because that's what they're doing. Well listen, I love bill, but I'll do that. You'll have that that day, so thank you for that and you'll be fucking let him. That's fine. I just think that format is like everybody thinks that everybody needs to be like fast, fast, fast, fast. It's not the case. Well look, I think both of us are proof that it's not the kids. I think for a long time everything was getting smaller and smaller. The Internet burst. This thing twitter came out, we're going to talk in 140 characters.

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       Buying came at six seconds, so everything kept getting smaller, smaller, smaller. But what I'm absolutely seeing now, we've only been doing my show in its current incarnation for two months. Sam was my first guest. This was the first week in September and we started doing long form stuff again, exactly what you're doing here. And what I've seen is the more, the longer we go, the more we extrapolate ideas, talk about stuff and don't scream at each other. I'm bringing on people on the right and on the left and the more that we do this, the more people want. So I think there's a bounce back now from that short thing, you know, where everybody on television, they start, you know, and it's partly like a show that I love on espn. Pardon the interruption. And they would have the countdown going, you know, and everything had to be quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

Speaker 2:          00:40:44       But I think people are actually ready for this. And, and I think clearly, and I don't think it, I mean that's why this is working for you. You know what I mean? People want to actually hear a couple of thoughts. Let's hear two things that don't necessarily line up and let's hear people that I listen. I hope that plenty of people that will be listening to this will disagree with me, will disagree with you. And at the end we'll go, well it's not because they're racist, but they got some ideas that let's challenge those ideas. Well I think the entertainment aspect of those shows where there's like five people in a room and then also you have a fucking audience that cheers and they agree and some and some of them are just so lefty, so super fucking applauding and every. Because he shuts up his own audience, which, how many Qa?

Speaker 2:          00:41:28       I've literally seen him do standup where he's yelled at the audience for giving him applause breaks. I mean, how many times have you ever seen that in a comedy show? That that's pretty good. We, yeah, in, during his show, he does do that with people chime in, but I just think that the entertainment aspect of, of expressing yourself almost sometimes takes precedent over the concepts and the ideas themselves because it's all in how you deliver it and how forcefully you can get it past the other people that are trying to say contrary points. So the Ben Affleck thing is the perfect example of that because by yelling out gross and racist within a minute. Right. So think about it. It's pretty much the worst thing you can say about somebody right to call them racist. That's pretty, you know, beyond you're a child molester or something. It's pretty much the worst thing you can say.

Speaker 2:          00:42:12       Think about if you were having an argument with somebody about, about this stuff, let's say you were privately arguing with someone about Islam and religion and blah blah, blah. It would take a while for you to call them racist, right? Like you wouldn't do it to go pretty deep by the time that you personally got there, to that place where you were to say you are racist. I don't think I would even, I would probably say that idea is racist. Right? So that would even say your racist because I got to think that like some people will say, wow, I have black friends. Well what do you like about black people? You know, like you go into that for and at the end of it, well they smell different. I like to be around people that are done with me. Okay. You're a fucking racist. You're a racist.

Speaker 2:          00:42:51       Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, but, but that illustrates your point perfectly that the problem with these shows and the problem with this discussion and problem with social justice, it's all like a perfect storm of craziness because the next day after that show, all the online sites mediate everybody. The headlines were all Ben Affleck Calls Bill Maher and Sam Harris Racist. So suddenly the onus was on them to prove that they are not raised exactly. That is not only is that bonkers, but I asked them about this and he, he said something that I thought was fascinating. He was on that show to discuss his book called Waking Up, which is a spiritual guide to a guide to spirituality without religion. So he's talking about meditation. He's talking about inner peace. I've read the book, you know, like some pretty lofty stuff. He said, from that point forward, the next six months in my life, we're on a book tour about inner peace, but all I had to do is defend myself that I'm not a racist.

Speaker 2:          00:43:44       How cosmically war that is. Well, and it came from, I believe Ben Affleck wanting to state a position that he felt would be very popular and when resonate it would get him social brownie points because that's what he did. What he said, the way they express themselves. It's not nuanced. It's not objective is not complex and well thought out and it's a very, very deep and important subject and massively important subject because what we're talking about in 2015 when you talking about any ancient religion, you're talking about clinging to these ideas that were formed and ingrained in these communities well before science. Well before people had a deep understanding of human psychology. Of human nature of the power of suggestion and culture and well before we understood the the world actually works as far as like as far as nature, as far as physics, as far as just the formation of the universe.

Speaker 2:          00:44:38       All of this information is not applicable to most of the religions in the world today. Not only are you right, but that's even what Sam wrote in and the faith that fat fucking Batman before the movie even came out, the new Batman like think how insane that is. If you really step back and dissect what you just said there, that if you took what the average person thought over the world and of science and medicine and everything that we know of and food and everything in 1840 by that standard now in 2015, that person would look pretty damn dumb, but for some reason these books that were written thousands of years in whatever it is, somehow those have some validity that we should still respect. We shouldn't respect these books. They're ideas. They're ideas that time has long since let go of. So by respecting them, we're actually doing something crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:45:27       If we want, if we really want to be free, if we want to be free thinkers and people that I don't give a fuck about anyone's race or religion or sex or sexuality, I judge people on what they say and what they think and what the social justice warriors are doing. They're trying to win this argument by shutting everybody down. Yes, and they they're doing it. I think there is a degree of them doing it for lofty reasons. I think Ben Affleck thinks in his lofty, rich Hollywood, whatever, that he's helping the downtrodden. I think there's something he does really know entirely circle. You know why? Because I know too many actors and I know what they are and you know, here's. Here's the thing about actors, and this is not all actors, obviously just like, you know, not all comics are heroin addicts and drug addicts and whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       I think that what it is to be an actor is to pretend to be something else. Right? That's, that's what it is and it's also you have to get passed the audition process and the audition process is essentially saying all the right things. So Dave, wherever you're from, where'd you grow up? And you have to like, you know who you voted for this. Like there's, there's that shit. There's a reason why Hollywood liens almost entirely left. Right. Do you think they really do, because I think a lot of them are secretly voting Republican taxes. Right? You know, you've got your Charleston Heston's in your fucking, you know, there's, there's a few John voight's out there and the guy from the was, it will be back in two and two with a chuckle or chuck will follow him on twitter just to laugh at all the fucking Republican Shit that he writes.

Speaker 2:          00:46:56       There's, there's always gonna be a few Hollywood conservatives. Obviously Chuck woolery is not in any big movies like that, but there always going to be a few conservatives in Hollywood. The casting people, the PR, the producers, the executives overwhelmingly left leaning and to be in that club you have to agree with them and there's a problem with that whole audition process when it comes to actors. You can't work unless someone approves you, unless someone takes you in and accepts you and chooses you. Dave, you're the right guy for the part. Yes. Yeah. Now you're. And you can't say anything controversial

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       that will fuck that up. And then you're essentially like, you're on a dating program for the world. Not, not dating, like you're trying to get laid, but like you're trying to get the world to love you. Yeah. So when a guy like Ben Affleck who's been doing this, his whole life gets on that show and someone says something that he thinks I can get in here and make some fucking points. I can get some social brownie points up on the board. I think that's racist. You're racist and this is gross. He's just like a guy at an audition. He's full of Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:47:58       You know what Rogan I'm going to prove to you right now that I, uh, I don't just say shit, but I believe it because you've changed my mind. That argument was good enough that you've changed my mind that I do agree that he wasn't doing it out of some lofty thing that it's purely that I'm with I, there might be a, you know, maybe we can split hairs a little bit and it's 80 slash 20 or whatever, but I think that actually does make more sense and it also explains why it happened within a minute because he was ready for it to happen before the segment even started. So yeah, I'll go.

Speaker 4:          00:48:24       I think there are also sociopath to get involved in philanthropic ventures to make themselves look good. Oh sure. I absolutely 100 percent believe that some people do some philanthropic shit so that it makes them look better. And, and, and this is, this is sort of to mask the psychosis that bubbles below the surface of their skin that they're trying to hide from people. Like you can't go after me. I work with the firefighters, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm, I support the first responders responders, you know, I'm down with the firefighters. You can't call me a plagiarist, but you can like send Dusky, like we'll, we'll be working with little kids helping all these little kids won't securely. That guy's not fucking them. How could he do that? He loves the children. I mean that, that is the kind of shit that happens with a lot evil

Speaker 3:          00:49:08       people. So this is interesting. So for comics then it really is particularly bizarre because there's the approval thing, right? And comics want approval just the same way actors, but comics are also the good ones and unfortunately there's not many of us left that you're supposed to stake out controversial positions. So that goes against the sort of mass approval thing, but it doesn't in comedy but. But right now he's counterculture. Cool. Right now. Does, does any. Is there any comic. There's a couple people I guess, that are doing some counterculture stuff. Okay. Letter. Getting credit for find counterculture. What counterculture that you'd be? You'd be really against the government. You'd be against the administration, you know, you'd be fighting more for some of the things that I think we're doing with the social justice where yourself fighting for free speech, relentlessly fighting against bad ideas so you could be fighting against the ideas of Islam without being racist or you're going to race, but without even being, without being bigoted towards Muslim people. Like right now I think partially because of Obama, it's cool to like the president, you know what I mean? Just by his, by the. He's black, he's cool. I'd love to play basketball with him. I'm sure he'd be fun to have a drink with. So it's cool to like the power right now. So in a weird way, I think if we have a republican president next time comedy's going to get a lot better real quick because it's going to be a lot easier to

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       attack. But is it cool to like him? If you look at the facts is a cool to like when you look at the ways attacked, whistleblowers is like nobody's talking about that. That's my point. People are, there's plenty of people are they are in podcasts. Yeah, yeah, I know a lot of really smart people that are attacking it. All right, well that guy's truck trussell, Duncan trussell Kurt Metzger. I know a lot of like very smart comics that just think it's fucking gross that you've got a guy that's killed more innocent people with drones or been responsible for being the lead. The commander and chief of the greatest army in the world has ever known that has caused thousands of people to die innocently through drone strikes. You know that like they're shooting it cell phones, they're shooting missiles at where a cell phone is and that's what, that's what metadata is.

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       We just blew up that hospital, blew up that hospital and you know, we could get into a whole thing about the, about the Middle East, but like there, there's terrible shit or the whistleblower thing I think is a good spot because you hear Edward Snowden on um, uh, Neil degrasse Tyson's show. No, I didn't. You should listen to it. It's amazing. It's great, but please go look, that's what Obama is doing right now. That's what he's doing. There's a reason that Obama, you know, a lot of people on the left, the progressives, when Obama got in immediately we're like, you know, he has to try, you know, Cheney for war crimes and Blah Blah Blah. And there's a reason why he didn't. That wasn't just about power. It was also because he's killing a lot of people with drones right now. In 20 years from now, he doesn't want that president, President Willow Smith or whoever it's going to be to come in.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       And Samantha, like j dot j. that's pink isn't going to win. Probably. Maybe. I guess Jayden probably would be the president and curse there. I don't know, but like whoever is going to be, it's going to be one of them. I might vote for will. How about that? You'd vote for. Well, I had my vote for will smith. Is he running? I don't know, but he's a smart motherfucker and I like, I like when I listened to him talk, I think he's a balanced and intelligent guard that expresses himself very well. He's extremely well read, but it's not a scientologist A. I don't think he's a scientologist, but I think he's dabbled. So as Jerry Seinfeld, they look. I bought dianetics. I bought it on an online, not even online. I got it from one of those late night infomercials in 1994 when I first moved to Hollywood.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       I remember those commercials all the time in the middle of the night for me while I'm in the middle of Lawrence Wright's going clear hallways. I can read it for too long, man. I go to other books because I read it for like a few chapters and I go, fuck this because it's so crazy. The thing on Hbs, I started the book first, then I watched the thing on hbo and then I keep going back to the book, but I haven't finished. It's got. It's got like probably I'm probably halfway in, but I, I, I can't, you know, it's weird about Kendall's. You don't see that you're halfway in. You see numbers like I like, I like a thickness thing where I'm like, I'm down to the bottom. I got like a very thin.

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       But even the numbers on that doesn't mean anything to me. Those numbers at the bottom, that show, you know, you're on page 100 and 500 pages. That's not, it's not registering. How do you, how do you decide if someone in this space, how much information to put in your brain? Because that's one of the things that I choose. Problem. Yeah. I struggle with this all the time because I love politics and I, I told you I've been going to the spin rooms. We can talk about some politics stuff. Um, and I love all that stuff and I love current events and I love Middle East politics and I love talking about religion, all of this shit. Like I love all that. That's what I'm here for, right? I'm on this earth, that's what I'm here for. But I do find sometimes I can't. There's just too much coming into my brain.

Speaker 1:          00:53:57       And then when you have my, you know, sitting on the couch and I'm watching Seinfeld, which I should be, should be the time that I can shut my brain down, write an episode that I've seen 150 times before that I know every line coming out and I had my ipad and I have my iphone and my laptop there and I'm doing this and it's like, it's like minority report from health and I really struggled with that, like shutting it down sometimes and you know, I'm not even just talking about the devices but just actually the stuff putting in your brain all the time and you gotTa Know Your Shit, you know, it's tough. Well, fortunately I don't necessarily really have to know my shit because you know, your shit I'll have to do is say I'm not sure about that and I'm okay because I'm a comedian, right?

Speaker 1:          00:54:43       We don't. But you know what I mean, like especially in these sorts of conversations like you and I, we exchanged some emails about some stuff that'd be cool to talk about, but we don't have a format. Obviously we're all over the place where gay discos and Ben Affleck's Douche and Bill Maher's formats are antiquated and there's, you can only have so much information in your head and this is part of the problem that I have with is going clear book. Why keep going to it and then going to other shit. It's because I feel like, why am I fucking reading so much about this sociopath fucking nightmare, crazy cult leader dude, that, that, that has formed this insane religion because I can't. Part of me can't put it down. Pardon me? I started reading about all the crazy shit that he did and how nutty this guy really was and how many people followed his wacky ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:55:35       That becomes fascinating. Could be talking about scientology or any religion. I could some wacky guy with some crazy ideas. That's a thought. Somebody was talking to him. Next thing you know. Yeah. Well there wasn't a lot of cash. Well, there's, you know, obviously there's different ones and some of them, the followers, like Mormons are notoriously nice people. I could tell that was one of the weirdest religions because there so nice. But then like if you go to Islam, Mohammed was a warlord. Yeah. And it's got a very different type of religion when first of all, you're dealing with the environment that these people live in is extremely hostile as far as the temperature is extremely hot. The, the, the, the battle for natural resources is very difficult. Is the end. You're also dealing with the cradle of civilization and I have this bit about

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       Islam that it never really came to fruition, but the eye, not even Islam but the Middle East rather. But the Middle East is essentially like they're the townies of the world because that's where culture was created and everybody looked. Human beings were created in Africa. That's where the first human beings came from out by however method, whether you believe in heaven,

Speaker 3:          00:56:43       illusion and the drop some shit. A promethium fucking terrible to be good. I wanted it to be good. I watched the beginning again, you know, with the, with the guy and he comes down and he splits the thing and I was like, what? What? What happened here?

Speaker 4:          00:57:01       The idea is that he ceded the world with his DNA and then he knew somehow or another would develop and the human being.

Speaker 3:          00:57:06       Why did shortlist ron not move a little to the left when the thing was falling? Remember the end. Oh yeah. There's the giant ship and it's falling and all she has to do, she's running straight in the ships ball in this way and it's slow. Real slow.

Speaker 4:          00:57:17       I want you to do is go a little panic attack. She just freaked out. She freaked out or panicked. I don't know this. We can get into that all day. She made up for it in a Mad Max. Yeah. That was awesome. Um, what was my point? What the fuck

Speaker 3:          00:57:30       we're going took you somewhere there. The beginning of the world. Mesopotamia

Speaker 4:          00:57:37       came from this one. The, the, the, the most ancient version of a human being like, I think they think that we're in this current form, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they're thinking it's like 250,000 plus years, right? So whatever that was at one point in time, they left Africa and a lot of them settled in the Middle East. Egypt of course is a part of Africa, but it is in the Middle East officially, and they spread out all throughout the country. But the, the oldest, what we know today as far as we know, the oldest written language, the oldest, uh, uh, agriculture, the oldest government structure was Sumir. And that's where Iraq is, you know, is you're dealing with like 6,000 plus years ago. That's, that's Iraq. I mean, that is, that, that's the cradle of civilization. It's a fucking shit hole, a crazy wacky, fucked up civil war. The Muslims are fighting, the Muslims that she has and the Sudanese are blowing each other up on roadside bombs. And it's chaos. It's chaos. And when you get to these parts of the world that are amongst the most ancient cultures, you have what I call the echoes of savages is like the culture has lasted for so long and the reverberations of these ancient ideas that have been long disproven and they're still there, they're there, permeated. Look,

Speaker 3:          00:58:56       that's why the Middle East especially, we could also talk about Israel, Palestinian people and all of it is such a cluster fuck because so you could take someone like Sam who will talk about it from the religious part, right, and he'll mostly blame religion and then you can take a lot of my friends on the left and they say it's all geopolitics and they usually blame the United States. The truth is, and as I said before, we have to have two thoughts at once and I know it's very hard for people to be able to do that. It's both.

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       It is both in the most extreme ways. Look, first of Iraq and Syria right now are not even countries. Your by any estimation of what a functioning country is that would partake in the world thing, nor is Libya. Libya is not in. Look, we did think about Libya for second. Obama did that. No Congressional authorization, right? Everyone goes crazy on Bush about Iraq. Now obviously in retrospect, the Iraq war is pretty bad and you can clearly make a line to it led to Isis, which then has now dba destabilize the whole thing, but he at least had congressional authorization. Now maybe he lied where we know now know that they were planting evidence and all that, but Obama went into Libya right when he became president with no congressional authorization. I have no idea what's going on in Libya right now. Is it a, is it a country?

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       Have you seen a board Danes show on it? The CNN show? Uh, I don't think it has. There been a Libyan just watching it last night about a Ethiopia that shows amazing. Yeah, he's, he's amazing. But you know, it's, it was, it was shit when Kadafi was running it, obviously it was a horrible, horrible place and he was a terrible evil dictator. But when you remove a dictator, you create a vacuum and that vacuum gets sucked up by people that want to try to claim power. Well, this is, this is the strange thing about the neocons, right? So neo-cons believed that we should use our American power to either nation build or you know, like I know, and everyone on the left, they'll say, well, they're doing it because we want their natural resources. Like it's again, it's one of these things that there's a zillion reasons why everyone wants some piece of that part of the world, but people will say, well, Iraq was better off with Saddam.

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       He was doing horrible things to his people. He was using mustard gas on the, on the courage, right. I think it was the Kurds. Um, so we've, we've helped. We backed leaders. Mubarak in Egypt was our guy. We backed him. Then they overthrew him. Then we backed the Muslim Brotherhood than they overthrew them. Now we're backing another Mubarak I like, we just do. Our policies are all crazy. It's all military industrial complex and it's just this endless cycle of craziness over there. I mean, you can't get any crazier than having a guy like Dick Cheney as the vice president who the CEO of Halliburton accompany the rebuilds places that we blow up. It sounds like a shorts and egor movie, right? Like he's the bad guy in shorts and acrimony from the eighties or the bad guy in Rambo. I mean it's, it's almost so obvious and that's why we can't believe it.

Speaker 2:          01:01:43       You know, it ain't because they're showing it to us. Exactly. Here's what it is, guys. No big deal. Halliburton, by the way, they're doing a lot of shit in Iraq right now. You think it's coincidence? Not only that, they got no bid contracts. Nobody has to bed. They have other people who are competing. What do we do? What do we, what do we do? We hope that inflammation and the distribution of information that's available today that was barely available when Bush was in office and we hope that the spread of that and the understanding of that will balance out all this shit and I'm hoping that that's the case with social justice warriors. I'm hoping that's the case with these right wing

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       fucking fanatics that want to blow up and bomb and invade everything that doesn't believe in Jesus. I'm hoping that all that stuff gets balanced out because I think the amount of change that we've experienced in our lifetime is unprecedented cultural change information will change, has been the big one. The, the, the invention of the Internet. I forget. I fully believe that when we go back and historians look at this point in time, they, they see it as an explosion of change, like a veritable explosion of ideas and have the ability to express themselves and your show represents that your, your podcast represents that you don't have anybody telling you what to do. You can talk about whatever you want. There's no, there's no studio execs come in and go, stop Dave. We've got to get off this subject. Dave, you can't talk about Ben Affleck. We're doing a film with Ben. One of our subsidiaries is very upset with this and that and that. You know, the affiliates are calling in right now. They want to cancel our program. We're gonna have to figure out a way to do this better. You said some bad things about abilify. Abilify is one of our new sponsors and you should ask your doctor about it because maybe you need it.

Speaker 3:          01:03:20       Yeah. Then my cloud gets even bigger. That's hanging over me all the time. It's really important, but yeah. I'm with you, but do you think we've gotten to a breaking point with that because I think one of the. One of the reasons that I wanted to do this with you and I've been harassing you to come on my show forever is because I see the things that we're talking about and our audiences are so interlaced. Right? And I really, really believe it has a lot to do with the Sam thing, but I think there's been. We're close to the tipping point of defeating the Social Justice Warriors. I really think themselves right? Well, because because identity politics ultimately has to eat itself. That's the fatal flaw, so that they'll take someone like Bernie Sanders who stands for every fucking progressive principle known to man. He doesn't want money in politics.

Speaker 3:          01:04:05       He's everything that the left wants and what happens? He has black lives matter. People grabbing the mic away from him a month ago screaming. He doesn't care enough about black lives when, when there's no reason to believe that, but if but if you parse everyone down to their one issue, so if you say that these people are only going to care about black lives matter and these people are only going to care about abortion and these people are only going to care about Islam or whatever it is, you ultimately your goal, you're just a group of people who ultimately have interests that have nothing to do with each other and you're going to destroy each other and that's why I think the reaction to this is so good and so powerful and I think it's. It's real. It's happening right now. I could feel it.

Speaker 4:          01:04:44       Well when that black lives matter thing happened, those girls were screaming and then he was saying, we're going to give them the mic from afterwards. Like what? That is not how you get to express yourself. That's not how you do it. You don't interrupt and decide that your message is more important than their mess.

Speaker 3:          01:04:59       Yeah, and of course their format, their place with their microphone at the same time. What did they probably end up doing? I don't have any empirical evidence on this, but they probably ended up strengthening the people that don't like them. You see what this, what this is doing, you know, so there, there's so much to it, but that's why I really, I the social justice

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       warrior thing and it has a lot the Sam thing in the way that they treated him. I'm talking about, you know, Glenn Greenwald and Reza and my former boss Janko. I know you've had on here the way these people treated him in this dishonest attack on ideas that it came from the left. We're supposed to debate ideas, right? We're on the left. So what are, what is liberalism stand for? We believe in the debate of ideas. You can say the people on the right. Well they're more dogmatic, they're more religious. They don't want to debate ideas. So I can't deal with those people. The right went off the deep end a long time ago, but I have to care about as someone that's on the left and that believes in liberal principles and doesn't want to see days thrown off the roof in Syria and all of that shit doesn't mean I want to invade Syria.

Speaker 2:          01:05:57       Doesn't mean you don't want to nation build, but I should be able to talk about that without being called a racist or whatever it is. And, and I think we've. We've hit something here. I think one of the things that we've hit is there are people that are balanced and that are socially aware and that are fun and interesting to talk to and then there's social retards and social retards that form on the left. They tend to be unbelievably aggressive and douchey about really good ideas. Yeah, like whether it's black lives matter or whether it's supporting gay rights or whether it's transgender rights or any of the ideas that I'm sure you and I could both agree with what they're doing and the way they're doing it, as they found something that gives them the green light to be an asshole and one of the things they're doing in being an asshole is they're making up for being picked on.

Speaker 2:          01:06:44       They're making up for being rejected. They're making up for the abuse that they've suffered at other people's hands that have caused them to have this unbalanced social persona. And that's what it's all about. It's about social retards with really good points. Yeah, I mean, yeah, you're on it. So you could use the gay rights thing as a great example of that. So, you know, look, we didn't have gay marriage until officially it was June 26, happened to be my birthday. Congratulations on my, on my birthday. The Supreme Court said you're asking, you know, I was engaged already at the time, but I kinda liked the idea of getting gay married when it wasn't fully legal because then I thought I'd be like running from the law or something like that. Had some. Yeah, I was going to be hunting a guy with one arm, you know, who killed my wife.

Speaker 2:          01:07:26       None of it made sense, but I had this idea of something in my head. But anyway, if you take that, that movement, look, it happened pretty damn quick. I know gay people have wanted rights for a long time, but if you take the last five years, the way this thing has evolved and now it's cool. Look, you're, you're a straight white man. Pretty much the worst thing there is, right? I mean, that's, that's what I hear. Yeah, you're just awful. Even sitting here, terrible person. It's been, you know, very grating for me. But uh, if you look at the gay rights thing, the left was all about it and I ended. They love games, they love gays, they love gays. But at the end of the day, now gays have equal rights and I know there's still job issues and there's some stuff, but we got that fucking lady in Kentucky that.

Speaker 2:          01:08:03       Yeah. Oh we can. Right. So there's still all kinds of shit. I don't mean to say that everything's perfect. Resistance for the point is the Supreme Court, the law of the land now is equal in terms of marriage. But what I realized sort of halfway through that was it's not that the left really cares about gays as much as sort of this idea sort of of what you're talking about. Because at the end of the day, now that gay people have equality, well guess what? Suddenly gay people might start voting Republican because they might monitor, vote on taxes. They might, they might, you know. So the identity politics thing is only good for a little while. And then once everyone's equal, it's, it's just, it's just a way of pitting people against each other. Yeah. Then you really just become a fat person with pink hair. Yeah. That's all you are.

Speaker 2:          01:08:52       You're not this amazing person with this moral high ground that stands above and gets to proclaim how they've been fighting for rights and screaming and yelling, crying. You're screaming and yelling and crying because you're socially retarded because why are these people, by the way, why are they all anonymous if there so lofty in there? No, no. I mean, I know there's public ones, but I'm not talking about that, but I mean the people that'll be yelling at me over some social justice yet. What are some. The writers were so. Oh yeah, but that's what I mean. I'm not defending. I think people sort of think that somehow I'm defending the right. There is nothing. I agree with these people on. You know what I mean? I have to clean my house and my house is on the left, so I want the left to be better.

Speaker 2:          01:09:30       I fully believe now that the regressives, which is what the progressives have become because their ideas are now regressive, not progressive, that they are the tea party of the left and if the Republicans, if the average conservative, whether you agree with them or not. Five years ago when the tea party was gaining strength and we're not going to negotiate with anyone in government shut downs and all that, if the average conservative had said, these are our principles, whether you agree or not, we believe in limited government, all of that stuff, low taxes, whatever strong defense, if they would have said that they might have been able to reel the tea party and a little bit, but instead they just went to their worst, the worst piece of them and I see it happening with us on the left and that's why I'm so against the regressive left.

Speaker 2:          01:10:12       We got to bring them back because otherwise we're going to have the regressive left and we're gonna have the tea party and guess what? The GIG is up. Yeah, I, I agree, but I think that is what you find in the universe. You find this extremely broad range. You find a spectrum and that spectrum you have completely psychotic on one side and completely psychotic horseshoe thing. Right? And then at the end they're the same. Yeah. And then this, it really is. I mean, and then there's, there's a balance and I think that a lot of, I think a lot of us given different circumstances could be swayed to have different points of view and different ideas and I, I'm also polled, not in a sense like logically, but I find myself compelled when I see people that are really religious. When I listened to like some Muslim guy that's speaking with great confidence and the power of Islam and the truth of Islam, I find myself compelled.

Speaker 2:          01:11:06       I don't believe it. I don't, I don't support it as an ideology, but I'm fascinating by the natural compulsion to want to join that. The natural human. Like there's something about someone who is unbelievably confident in what they're doing is the right thing and is, is proclaiming it publicly and loudly through a microphone that makes you go, wow, maybe he's right. Islam is the truth. And kinda like hit like exactly like his. But that's. But that's why it's a human nature thing. It is human nature. And look if, if that's why they attract all these people, there's no doubt that that's what's going on here. And what we have to do, listen, I don't know what's going on in the universe in the scheme of I have no freaking idea, but that doesn't, that's fertile ground for someone having to make that leap of faith and being like, I don't have any idea.

Speaker 2:          01:11:58       So yeah, just say I'm going to follow the Ten Commandments. I mean I'm pretty much. Well I don't believe in religion in any way whatsoever, but I get. If we were to have the 10 commandments, I'm probably sure I'm pretty much following them because they're just basic. I don't kill people. I don't covet your neighbor's wife. That's a gay thing. But you know, like there was actually a property thing, you know, it was his property. You by covenant taking her. Yeah. But, but I mean the point is that you can live your life as I think both of us do and probably most of your listeners do buy. You can have a set of principles that has nothing to do with religion and which is what waking up is about. Yeah, that's exactly what we're about. And that's, that's the crazy part of what the left is doing here, you know, there's this onslaught against new atheist, so against Sam and Richard Dawkins and uh, and hitchins even though he's not around anymore.

Speaker 2:          01:12:48       And I didn't know what new atheists were even. So I started asking some people in, my friend Kyle said, he said, I think it's just an atheist who's finally saying I'm here because for a long time atheist wouldn't even say that they were here. And now you have the far left is the ones that are attacking atheist. Isn't it supposed to be the far right attacking the people who don't want anything to do with religion? It's incredibly warm. Yeah. It is incredibly warm ups and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. And there was a real really recent, um, have you seen Sam Harris's, uh, there's something I tweeted a few days ago, Sam Harris on. It's on something called secular talk. It's on youtube. Yeah. So Kyle is the guy that I just, uh, he's the friend that said to me about the new atheist thing. So they picked up basically where our conversation ended because when I did that and that.

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       You're gonna play clip. No, no, I'm not. But I was going to say that Sam snapped. He snapped. I wouldn't say snap, but by his Breton. Yeah. He said snapped. Yeah. That's how he described it too. But he expressed himself about what's really going on with these people, whether it's Greenwald or I'll let him pick who it was and what it was. But if you listen to it, it's the thing, the, the, the channel on Youtube called secular talk and the title of it is Sam Harris on progressivism torture, religion and foreign policy. It's fucking fantastic because he's so elegant, so eloquent, elegant as well, but eloquent. And he just nails perfectly

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       expressed what's going on. So is that the inherent problem then? Because what I see when I did my sit down with him, I laid it out very clearly. I said to him, Sam, let's take the five things that people misquote you about the most and let's make it very youtube friendly so that when these crazy people are screaming about you, anyone on twitter can be like, here's a link. Give it five minutes. So we did it and he laid out a, you know, the profiling. He laid out the nuclear first strike. He laid out all Muslims, verse Islam, you know, all that. Islam is the mother lode of bad ideas, which he did backtrack a little bit because again, it's about, it's about ideas, not the slanders. Right? So that's how we laid it out. And then we. And then we did the whole thing and I felt when I was done with that, sit down again, this was my first episode of my show.

Speaker 3:          01:14:53       I was like, I'm done with this topic. I, I felt I had added a little something to this. I had helped the discourse a little bit and then suddenly right after that, they all were worse. I'll have Glenn Reza Jank. They all double down. Literally. Glen retweeted a misquote from our interview that that Sam said it was something about Sam mentions profiling and he's talking about Jerry Seinfeld. He's talking about Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld should not be profiled that this is a guy who should be able to walk right through because it's a silly use of resources to Glen retweet something where they said people who look like Jerry Seinfeld completely not what he said. Well, first of all, Jerry Seinfeld easily could be Arab, so that's I think one of his parents, his Syrian. Actually, that's a ridiculous thing to say, so not look like him. By the way, when Sam does the profiling and he talks about how he should be profiled based on his own looks because because he's a.

Speaker 3:          01:15:50       he's a middle aged man and if a middle, a middle aged white guy, whatever. He's not even talking about the race in this instance that if me or you, if me and you, we're right now going lax that we should be profiled. They should look at two guys of a certain age and whatever, whatever their criteria are. Not based on race or religion, but there should be some more, uh, they should look at us in a more curious way than perhaps an eight year old Dutch woman that's in a wheelchair or he's trying to have smart profiling or what he calls anti profiling. The problem with profile really is you're getting profiled by people that are so fucking dumb. They work for the TSA. Right? So that's, that's a real issue. As I read this whole thing that they give people, like recognizing facial expressions, like, get the fuck outta here.

Speaker 3:          01:16:36       Have you ever. You ever like paused for a minute when you're looking for something and been a fly on the wall while the TSA agents are talking to each other about what they want to eat or what this is saying. Any and barely paying any attention. They're just folks work in a job, you know, that's what they are. The folks that got a job. Well, to that point, I mean, look, if we really wanted to profile in the way that profiling should be done, then you have to do it the way the Israelis do it, which is that you're, they have cameras on everybody watching every bit of body language and every bit of nuance. I mean even I went, uh, I went

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       to Israel I think in 97 and I to get in, had to go in a separate room and they asked me every question you could possibly think of. I'm a Jew from long island. I was profiled, you know what I mean? Like that. They're not doing it out of fun. They're not, they just don't want their planes to explode. And I had to explain something about where my bar Mitzvah was. I mean really crazy shit, but I'm pretty sure they would prefer not to have to do that. And I didn't walk away going, Oh man, profiling like that. That's the worst thing that world. There are certain things that are these. This is a very difficult discussion to have because the social justice warriors make it so that even when we're talking about this now, there's this feeling that somehow I'm before profiling, I mean, I think they should just be ignored.

Speaker 2:          01:17:53       These so called social justice warriors, and I think that as times going on, they're becoming so ridiculous that they're either doing it to themselves. There was a great story that I tweeted a couple of days ago, um, antifeminist speaker disinvited to uncomfortable learning in quotes, lecture series a because she made students uncomfortable but don't safe spaces. But listen to this man. The thing is called uncomfortable learning. That is this the lecture series. And they disinvited her because she made students uncomfortable. I mean, this is fucking madness. I mean, this is exactly what we're talking about here. Also, think how dangerous it is to do this to college kid more than anything else. Because first off, you're dragging the kids, right? We know, we know that they're all on Ritalin and all that shit right there on all that. Now they go to college. Even the ones that aren't on that, you if they go to college, college is supposed to be where you figure out what your sort of base ideas are before you go out into the real world.

Speaker 2:          01:18:51       If you're going to sign, you know, the college is Brandeis University silenced Ayaan Hirsi Ali. I have heard on my show next week like I want to go into that. Like what? Insanity. You know what I mean? It's perverse at the highest. What is their dispute? Because I think the argument was that she doesn't like Islam, but she was raised in. It almost killed her coworker van Gogh's grandson or whatever was killed on the street in Holland for cartoon and she's talking about ideas again and this is what Sam says all time. We have to talk about ideas, not people. What other set of ideas would we be afraid to talk about? What is going on in universities though? Is it the students that are dictating the policy by, by protesting and is it the professors? I think. I think it's coming from the professors partly for what you said before about athletic, like there's this idea if you want to be a professor, sort of in Gad said talks about this a lot because he is a college professor and I know he's had his struggles as someone that is outing this bullshit.

Speaker 2:          01:19:51       I think he's had his professional struggles. I think in our interview he talked a little bit about some exchanges he's had with other professors where they don't want to touch some of his ideas because of. Not that he's talking about anything really controversial at the end of the day, they don't want to touch it, but it's because of the professor of the PR pressure from the students or is this coming first? I think it's coming first from the professors or or even whatever is above that. I don't know if it's the administration's or even whatever is above that. Like I don't know how high you have to go with it, but I don't think it's the kids that are doing it. I think they are being fed shit and they're being fed fear and stupidity and then they just bow, you know, they just sort of rally around is also a real problem in colleges.

Speaker 2:          01:20:30       I believe that these people that operate in academia, I've only worked in Ghana and they don't really understand the real world because they aren't in it and they're in a position of power with young people, so their ideas have incredible influence. They're standing on this stage, teat teaching these lectures, teaching these classes, and they have these young impressionable people that are listening to them just gives them a gigantic ego boost. They have this platform and they have never competed in the real world. They've never contributed to the real world other than teaching children. And there's a lot of them like that that have gone through the educational system and then gone from the educational system directly to teaching and then this is their, this is their universe and this is how they exist and these people are pretty much all part of the regressive left.

Speaker 2:          01:21:15       They are pretty much all parties. So if you could think, here's a simple example of this, so there's a difference between debating ideas and hate speech. So let's say somebody that that hated Muslim people want it to speak at a college and it was going to talk about how we should kick them out of the country or we should whatever horrible things to them, I could see absolutely protest that person. Use Your right of free speech and free assembly to protest that person's ideas. Should the college not let them come. You know, if it was purely hate, I suppose. But I know that that's a really slippery slope because everyone, you know, versus you could take any of these people ion Hirsi Ali, she's not against Muslim people. She's against the doctrine, these ideas. And if we can't make the distinction between hate speech and someone who wants to debate ideas, if you can't do that in college, then where the hell else can you?

Speaker 2:          01:22:10       Not only that, try getting some inflammatory quotes by Ian Hirsi Ali that you could argue against that aren't live really well thought out, that aren't articulate, that aren't based on her personal experiences growing up in this religion. Her understanding of the scripture like try, try, try finding some ignorant Hayden that you're not going to. These guys don't want to debate ideas. It's really as simple as that. So at the very personal level I can tell you. So you've had Janken. He was my former boss for two years at tyt. He watched the original thing with Sam and then sat down with him for three hours. Did you see any of that shit? I watched the whole thing. Three hours. I watched that thing. I was working for him at the time. Literally like my. I was like this the entire time because I was having a headache because I could not believe that this person that I worked for who I respect, who I play basketball with every Sunday, that he was so dense to the ideas that Sam was portraying.

Speaker 2:          01:23:11       And at the end of it, just as I said to you before that at the end of mine, I thought I had made this conversation a little bit better. Jank only doubled down on all of this shit because they don't want to debate ideas. They want, they just want Sam to be discredited so that their ideas when. And that's why we have to fight against it. Because if sam disappears, as I said earlier, if Sam disappears tomorrow, it's not about him. It's about all the ideas that will all be afraid to talk about. That's why Charlie Hebdo cartoons, you should be able to, family guy can do whatever the fuck they want on Jesus. Right? Every episode, there's a, you know, there's an episode where Jesus is bathing with porn music in the background in front of [inaudible] a baby. Nobody had a problem with that. Try doing that with Mohammed. But we can't have, we can't just pick, you can pick, say whatever the fuck you want about Judaism.

Speaker 2:          01:23:56       Big Goddamn deal. What is it with Cenk? What I mean, you, you know, um, I, that, that was really perplexing to me because I usually feel like you were there are agree with him or don't agree with him on other things. I feel like he's, you know, he's got an opinion, he thinks about it, he talks about it, he tries to be open minded, he's passionate about these ideas, but with that it was so confusing to me because it was almost like he was just trying to win, look like he was trying to find a way to beat someone who is, you know, Samson intellectual black belt, like a high level world champion black belts of the spoken word. And I think that Jank it's not at the same level of Sam when they come when it comes to debating these ideas at one point about 20 minutes in Sam does lays out some basic probability stuff and yanked your says he doesn't believe in it.

Speaker 2:          01:24:47       I mean that, that sort of explains it right there. Like Sam wasn't laying out a plan. He was just saying this is sorta how probability works. And Jack was like, no, no, no, no, I don't. I don't believe in it. I don't know. And just for the record, I get no pleasure even talking about this because you know, you know, you know what it's like. Did you debate Cenk or having a conversation with him off the air? No, we didn't because it just, it just never materialized, you know what I mean? A lot of times when, although I did do the main young Turk show with him a lot, most of the time because I was on it, it was because he was out of town, so I was either filling in or something like that. So there wasn't really the forum for that. Um, and then it really had a lot to do with why I left because I just could not believe it that, I mean there's, there's people that have edited things where Jake says one thing directly to Sam's face and then days later is saying the complete reverse thing. Sitting down with Reza Aslan and saying that, yeah, he means all Muslims. And it's like, ugh. You just said to his face, you just said to his face that, you know, that's not what he says and I think it's partly, it goes to that AFLAC thing that he's trying to be this, he's trying to defend Muslim people that he feels are being abused and, and there's a lofty goal there somewhere, but if you use the tactics of dishonesty

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       and slander and smearing and all that to get there, you, it's not good. It's not good. So I don't know. It's awful. But I really liked him. That's what fucks me up. I, I feel completely the same way and actually I am. So when I left I just left the thing be and I was like, all right, that's it. You know, I left, we left on good terms, we went out to breakfast, we were good to go, and then he just kept on twitter, kept lying about it, misrepresenting ideas and people and tons of his own fans were turning on him. So I just finally, after months I was like, I can't take this anymore. I've got to do something. And I didn't know. I didn't know what to do because you know, it's like, it's like here's a friend, here's a coworker, a contemporary, like how do I do this in a respectful way?

Speaker 3:          01:26:46       And finally one night I laid out like eight or 10 tweets in a row. I thought them all through first and I was like, Jack, here's what I think is going on because I needed it to be public because if I had just sent them an email, I've, you know, he could either not respond to respond, but what does that do at the end of the day if me and him get to our mayor Kulpa, but it's not public, right? So in a very respectful and not attacking me, I laid out some stuff. He completely ignored it. A couple of weeks went by, finally I did something and finally he responded, but then just kept doing the same shit. So I don't know what the answer is but I. But this is what Glenn is done. This is what Rez is done. I don't get it. I looked. These are tactics, these are tactics they're using to win.

Speaker 3:          01:27:27       Marginalized was right on my show who cowrote sandblast book, it was a discussion about Islam called the future of tolerance Islam in the future of tolerance. So I'm pretty sure these are people on the side of tolerance, right? Majid, who by the way has been treated worse than anybody, you know, like one of these guys that works at, at, uh, the intercept for Glen called a Mojito porch monkey while he was sitting next to Sam. You know what I mean? Like, because you, oh, you don't believe what we think you're supposed to believe as a Muslim person and you're with an atheist, you're his porch monkey. I mean, think if that came from the right, how we would rightly react, react to that or how these guys on the left you would react to that. Um, so anyway, so, so sadly, and that's what leaves me with such like conflict here is that I don't think it's going to stop.

Speaker 3:          01:28:12       And I, and I think they've learned, you know what? What's that Hitler quote? Like, the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it. I think they're partly operating on that, that the opportunity cost for Sam, for you, for me, for anyone that cares about any of this, to clean up the mess is is way too much for just up Sam's racist. That's the one that's easy, but now same to clean it up and it's. And it's a two hour frustrated conversation that he had and yeah, as you said, if you listen to it fucking brilliant, brilliant.

Speaker 4:          01:28:41       It was a two hour conversation that is trying to balance out x amount of months of disinformation, but I think that ultimately in the long run his ideas are more accurate. They're more like what he's saying is well thought through and his opinions are better considered. I when you

Speaker 2:          01:29:03       cannot, cannot made it through one with you. What with me? Sure. And it wasn't at one and it looked at one to the point that I, as I said before, I think there's a tipping point coming because I do think our site is getting stronger. I really do. But the amount of effort and energy he has had to put into this and when you see. I think it's. There's a chilling effect when they, when people see the ad, I'm not talking about us. When the average person sees what has happened to this guy again, you've sat with him for probably 20 hours, never thought he was a racist before. When the average person sees what they've done to him, it causes the average person not to want to speak about something. I get emails. I'm sure you get them. I got an email a couple of days ago from someone in Sweden saying, I am terrified to talk about any of this stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:29:46       I'm terrified to talk about what's happening in my country right now. You know, and, and I'm getting emails from all over literally all way from Saudi Arabia and all over the place. People saying you're talking about stuff that people are afraid to talk about. I'm not doing it for any other reason other than I feel like I have to. It's not. You know what I mean? Like I feel like I'm on this road because it, it just appeared before me. If this wasn't where I really wanted to go, my standard was a lot about transformers and gi Joe. Stupid Shit, right? I don't know. Yeah. I don't know either. I don't know either, but I think that when guys like Jank do say things that are easily discredited. When you say like, look, you said this one thing two days ago when you were talking to Sam, now you're saying something completely different when he's not here.

Speaker 2:          01:30:32       That is so bad for people's perception of your ideas. It's so bad for your own credibility. It's so bad when you express opinions about other things, like you can say something like, as a comic you can say things and you can joke around them and I can know that you're joking so I can I. okay. He doesn't really believe that and you're fucking around, but that's this. This isn't fucking around. So you're being held to your ideas, your ideas. You're held accountable for your ideas and when your ideas are massively inconsistent and contrary days later and when you are expressing an idea that you have to know is incorrect. So that's the part that I don't understand because look, I have fucked up, we've all done fucked up things in our life. We've all, we've all lied, we've all, whatever I have. Maybe you bro, not you, not you.

Speaker 2:          01:31:25       I know. We've, we've asked yourself, we've all made mistakes. You know, look, Brian Williams made some stupid part ego mistake, part, whatever you want to call it. A and then only found like 15 different but everything being equal, they weren't like cataclysmic lies in the scheme of what, uh, you know what I mean in the scheme of things, they were about his little adventures that he exaggerated partly because of the media because the media wants you to be a star two. So he has to go on the tonight show and talk about being on a helicopter. Went actually, would Walter Cronkite have done that? Probably. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       I've got a friend, Steve Reynolds easy and I think, you know, his story, the nine slash 11 story. Um, and I, I think they're really similar. The Brian Williams thing and that like both original stories. We're actually pretty impressive and these guys doctored them up and turned them into this epic thing that ultimately cost them a shitload of credibility, if not all their credibility with Brian Williams. He was actually in a fucking helicopter in Iraq. The helicopter in front of them was shot at. So like, that's scary as fuck. You're a reporter, you're getting shot at you, you're hearing gunshots. Go off the people in front of you or a hit. That's a good story. Your helicopter had to get hit though because ultimately these people are full of shit and they have to exaggerate and, and, and jazz it up. They don't. And because of that, you can't trust what they're saying.

Speaker 1:          01:32:51       Right. So then that, then it has that effect where you go at this guy did this one. Exactly, but think about it. Actually my point was actually the reverse of that because what I was going to say is that his, his lies were little additional details, you know, like a little. I'm a little cooler details what these guys have done have been too blatantly distort. Yeah. Someone's views. So we talked to you about opponent. That's the difference, right? Because it's a competition between Jenkins, Sam. Right. So, so what do you do with that? So what do I can't? Well, I, I like junk but I'm not turning to him for advice or ideas. Now I can't. I mean that's how I listened to his. When I listened to his opinions about things I unfortunately have to take into consideration that has been massively inconsistent about this one thing.

Speaker 1:          01:33:34       So when, when someone is caught or exposure, whatever you want to call it, to have so severely misrepresented someone else's views, how were you able to separate that from the other, the rest? So let's say you like 80 percent of his views or anybody would have to make it about him. How, how do you separate that out? Because I, at this point, I don't know how I do it at all and I know Sam has said that about Glen. Even when it comes to the, uh, the NSA stuff, he's like, I don't know what to make of that now because I know what this person is capable of. I think that's a really interesting point. It's a very interesting point and it's a very important point because I have people on this podcast all the time that I don't agree with and I want to hear their thoughts.

Speaker 1:          01:34:12       I want to know why. I had this conversation with Mark Marin the other night at the comedy store and he was like, why'd you have that guy on? You know that guys have this, and then he said that because I want to find out what makes them tick. I want to find out what goes on his head that goes on in his head, but there's a difference between someone I don't agree with and someone who I know is distorting that use of another person, like changing someone's words, changing someone's intent and and doing it for their own benefit, doing it so that they can win this ideological conversation, this argument that that becomes a real issue and there also becomes a real issue. Like what if I having a conversation with you and then two weeks later you distort what I say? Exactly. I don't want to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:34:51       I don't. I don't want to have to defend my ideas because you've mislabeled them or ms.ms dot, you know, misconstrued. You know, it's funny. It's also what is so cool about being in the digital space because as I said, people are first off, people are clipping things. You can clip on twitter, here's what you did, here's what you did and they can explain to them, so first off you've empowered the people at the bottom of this that are just consuming it are now able to get their voices heard, to fight the bullshit and I think that there has been a real wave with that which is incredibly inspiring to me. It's so different than ever before and look, see if someone came on here. If I come on here and I said something that was profoundly dishonest or was smearing of someone else, I would never hear the end of it and and hopefully people would tag you on twitter and you retweet the shit out of it until everybody had seen.

Speaker 1:          01:35:37       You see what fucking Rubin did and whatever. Now I'm pretty sure that's not going to have not the end of this, but when you don't, it doesn't benefit. You know, it doesn't benefit because you can be. That's what I don't understand about these guys. How can you do this? How can you retweet memes? Implying that Sam wants to a nuclear entire Middle East. When you first of all, you know his whole thing on nuking the first right thing. It's at the end of end of faith. It's about a page and a half. That's how much time he spent on this topic and they've made it sound like this is his bucket and go to his position and he's. He's talking about a horrific scenario or some isis type civilization has control of nuclear weapons and there's a real threat that they're going to use them on other people. That's what he's talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:36:20       Apocalyptic regime. You asked what he's talking. You have to consider that. If that's possibility, if it's a possibility that there could be a regime like that somewhere in the world, you have to say, well, what would we do? What are the options? What could you do in that scenario to not debate that is to like dig your head in the sand and that's. That's the bigger problem. What do you think Barack Obama thinks on this? We have nukes right now. We know we have new because we're the only country that's used nukes. Do you think that Barack Obama would only wait until we were nuked to use nukes? Probably not. Right? I don't know. I mean I couldn't, no matter how much discussion there. Yeah, there's a discussion there and I think that's the. That's the deal. It's like a discussion. I think when you discredit people would be dishonest statements.

Speaker 1:          01:37:06       When you say things that you know are not true, it becomes a huge issue. Not not like what you're talking about. When you said, well, I'm pretty sure no one's gonna find contradictory statements by me. Well, it's because there's no benefit in it. Yeah. Like you like is not going to really gain points by distorting Sam's perspectives on things. He is only going to gain points with people who don't actually know Sam's perspective. He's going to lose massively when people do listen to what Sam says. Yeah, because then you all of a sudden, whatever goodwill and whatever, love and appreciation for your ideas, that's going to go out the window when they find out that your ideas have been distorted, that your your points of view rather of other people's ideas. I've been distorted. Yeah. I've had that happen to me on this show. I show with a guy that I actually like.

Speaker 1:          01:38:02       Even though he did this sky, Jamie Kilstein and ancillary. We did. He's a social justice warrior. The whole deal. I don't think he's a bad guy. I really don't. I like them as human being. I, every time I talked to him, I enjoy talking to them, but we did a podcast to get together and we disagreed on a bunch of things. Then when he went on his podcast and completely distorted everything that I said and changed the entire conversation to him being a victim, which is, which is one. Oh, one one. Oh, and then this guy online put together the actual conversation and Jamie's perception of the conversation and it said it was, I forget the Kilstein delusion. It was the name of the video and because of that he received so much fucking hate and I think that made him aware of that and he said it was the low moment of his life and he completely good stop doing that and he doesn't do any of that shit anymore and you know, he's rebounded and now he's happier than he's ever been before.

Speaker 1:          01:38:57       But I think that that type of behavior is not to standard. It's accepted. It's almost expected, you know, it's like what they do and that's if you're a part of that victim culture, the perpetual victim culture, that's how you do it, you, you, you make it seem like people were yelling at you and there's people and they were so upset with me and all I was doing was trying to say that women shouldn't be raped. That's not what happened. Not what happened. That must've been incredibly validating for you. Right? Like because it, because it's personal too, and that that's why you can see my body language probably when I talk about Jake doesn't, I get no pleasure out of this. This is not how I see. I didn't go to work for this guy and agree with so much of, you know, get money out of politics.

Speaker 1:          01:39:38       You know, his, his core stuff. I didn't go there for my feelings ultimately to be this, but that's where we're at. So in a case like you're talking about with Jamie, it's extremely validating that you create a space based on a certain amount of principles. Someone goes against them, your audience then calls them out and then there's like a teachable moment to him. It's pretty good, pretty great. I think in that way it's great. I don't, I didn't take any pleasure in the fact that he got fucked up emotionally because of it or not that the hate that you get online, especially if you're like a super sensitive person that's really trolling for love. You know all your fucking lines in the water and you're trolling for love. That's what you're doing. And in saying that, and even becoming this victim, you're trolling for love.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       I mean, it's, you're trying to do, trying to get people to fuck Joe Rogan. Fuck that. Transphobic, homophobic, racist, sexist, misogynistic, asshole. Like throw them all out there, throw them all out there. I mean, but that's what's what, what's going on when someone's. And you got to realize that when you distort people's perceptions or distort people's positions for your own personal benefit, you do yourself a horrible disservice because you now have ruined any validity, any, any, anything that you have in the past that may resonate with people. You've ruined that because now you've poisoned that well.

Speaker 3:          01:40:58       Yeah. So it can be so laid out clearly like this. Let's say that two of the five things that Sam, you know, those controversial things. So the profiling thing, right? Um, or we belaboring this point because I think it's so there's so much to it. Yeah. Okay. Um, but let's say Sam would argue that because these are debatable ideas, we should debate them. So imagine if subsequently so they do the three hours, sit down, he and Jane and after that instead of saying he wants to profile Muslim Ba, Ba and Ba, ba Ba and all that bravado and bullshit and whatever. I imagine if he had said, you know, Sam and I really disagree on this, I fear that Sam's use of anti profiling, we're profiling whatever you want to call it. I fear that ultimately it will lead if you know for, for good and you know the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Speaker 3:          01:41:48       I think that he's trying to do something good, but ultimately it's going to lead to Muslim people feeling persecuted, feeling like the other. But if he had laid that out like that and had an intellectually honest say, we believe different things here and that's okay. You have a pretty great place to be. Yes, you have a pretty fucking great place to be. People who who prayer pretty much agree on most things and that we can move forward and go, we disagree. But when you do what he did, you've, you've just, you've ransacked the playing field and now and now you just have burned bullshit and that's what it's become. So that's why when you mentioned Kyle's podcast, that's why Sam, that's as frustrated as I've ever heard him, but as you said, it was still pretty eloquent and pretty elegant, but he's pissed. He's pissed and I think rightly so. And that's why, that's why I've been so defensive over the guy because I know it's like, let's have this, if we can do this now. It's only gonna get worse.

Speaker 1:          01:42:44       I have as well. I mean I've been very defensive with them as well and unfortunately I have a good friend, Abby Martin that I love dearly as well, but she and Sam have gone back and forth about this and I think she in some ways distorts his perceptions. I mean, I've seen, I've seen her story. I don't know her that well, so I don't want to. I love her. She's awesome. I've seen her, the stored a lot of facts on air to talk about, about different things. She gets very passionate and I think sometimes she misses the mark on certain things, but she's a very good person and I think she's ultimately, she has all the right intentions, but the intention is to have the pay the road to hell, those fucking things. You see what I'm saying? That yes it is. It's like with a guy like Genco, I think he's his own worst enemy in that regard because once you start doing that, then you have to sort of double down just to try to figure out a more eloquent way of reestablishing your position and when you do that, like people don't take you seriously anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:43:42       That's the problem. That's a real problem. You become your own enemy.

Speaker 3:          01:43:45       Yeah. You throw out that bomb of bullshit and now you're not going to be. There was a point, there is time. Look,

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       if you said something that was completely untrue or, or you smeared somebody, right, and then two weeks later you thought it through. Even if you. Even if you knew you were lying when you did it, but two weeks later you're like, wow, I really shouldn't have done that. Like I intended to do something good there. You could backtrack with the value that you have in your name and your fans. They would follow you back. Yeah. A couple of people will be like, fuck him, but. But people would go and if you calmly explained what happened, you could. The problem with these guys is they've gone and they kept going and kept going and kept going, but they're so off the range now. In my view, there's nothing they could do to ever fix this situation. It's like a guy, I know where I'm going, but you really don't, and then you just keep saying, I know where you're going.

Speaker 2:          01:44:33       Your last further and further in the woods. Like, dude, you're so far from the fucking road. Now you're going to have to shoot yourself and come back as a baby and lived your life again because this is a disaster we created. Yeah. Yeah. I just. I don't know. I don't. I don't know how to fix that, but I know what it is when I see it. Yeah. Well I think this is fixing it. I think this is fixing that. That's actually when I woke up this morning and even when I went to bed last night, I was like in a great place because I was like, I knew I wanted to have this conversation and I try. I've had it in little bites on my show, but I don't like. Not that this has really been about me because this is about some big stuff, but we're having more of a of a lofty thing here.

Speaker 2:          01:45:13       Then it is about you in a way because you're a part of this big stuff and also when you're doing your show like the Rubin report, what you're doing is you're expressing yourself and you become a credible portal to these ideas and information. So it is about you in a way because it's about all of us and it's about your credibility as that portal and you, you. You have to defend that, that that's fucking. Look, I'm wrong about shit all the time, but if I'm wrong about shit, dude, I'm the first person to tell you I'm wrong about it because I'm horrified if I. unless it's some simple stupid mistake, but when I'm. When I'm making. If I make a mistake, I want to be the first guy to talk about it. I don't, I don't want anybody believing anything that's not true to help my ego.

Speaker 2:          01:46:01       So you've had a carer, Santa Maria on her. So she's, she's a good friend of mine, worked with me at tea lover and I am not. Yeah, I love her too. She's fantastic. And she is a science communicator. That's the way she describes herself. Um, I think she had something to do with this brain surgery life thing last night. Yes. I machio yes. So she's doing really good stuff and I really respect her in Laker a many. I've said to my audience many times, you know, I know a lot about politics, garden beds, all this stuff. I'm not a science guy, like, you know, I can understand basic stuff, but I'm not a scientist. So I have to trust people that know about science to tell me things. So many times I've brought her on just to clean up messes that I've made. Sure. So I never go with the, uh, I never go with the presumption to my audience that I know everything about everything.

Speaker 2:          01:46:44       I'm going to bring on some people and look then. So when I've done things on GMO is with Cara, she, she is, uh, she firmly believes in Gmos and that's a whole, that's a whole other thing, right? But I know a lot of people don't like her stance on Gmos, but I say, here's my science person, here's what she said about this, and I'm actually trying to find someone that's a little more against GMO is now to come on and refute some of that stuff. We don't have as the interviewer, as the guy on this side of it. We don't have to know everything, which is what you said before that that does give us a little bit of a leash, right? Because we're sitting across from someone and we're just bouncing ideas. We're also talking about so many different subjects. It's impossible to be an expert in all of that.

Speaker 2:          01:47:22       Yeah. I guess this actually goes to your point about the format of realtime and all these shows that look at, look at where we bounced here already. You know what I mean? There's only a couple areas where I feel real comfortable and saying I'm an expert, I'm an expert in stand up comedy and I'm an expert in martial arts and even in martial arts there's, there's certain aspects of martial arts where I have to defer to other experts. Yeah. You know, there's just too many styles. There's too many different. There's, you know, there's some different weird Filipinos. There's C lot, there's different stick fighting styles and like you can't know everything. You can't. Well you can't, not only can't know anything, but if you want to see how the thing that you consider yourself an expert in how it, how it all sort of leads to one road, look what you did with men because you had a set of principles, right?

Speaker 2:          01:48:09       You had a set of principles in something that you love. Stand up. Right? I mean, is there anything you love more than stand up beside wife and kids? Like, is that it? Yeah, friend's wife, kids health, but in terms of the other things like standards, right? Yeah. And, and, and what you did with Mensa, which I'm sure you've talked about a bajillion times already. Uh, do you remember we met one to actually know what did we meet? We met at the young Turks. You were going to do an air show and we were, we were talking for a few minutes and obviously I knew who you were, but I didn't want. I'm a comic too, like I just didn't. So we just shot the shit for a few minutes and we talked about that a little bit, but my point is that because you, you used the set of principles that are guiding you right now to do this show are the same principles that you use to defend your art in, in that moment, you know, so all of these things, they all come together one way or another.

Speaker 2:          01:48:57       In some ways. The real problem with that men, a thing was that the art form is being compromised, not just by him stealing from other people, but him creating an environment where people are terrified to express themselves. Like I mean, look at that social justice warrior, right? That's the same thing that they've done by jake yelling racist. Now what have you done? Most sort of. He was. You couldn't express yourself because he would steal those ideas and call them his own and that's why I think there was literally like a signal that people would do where you'd be on stage for five minutes. He had a 15 minute set and all of a sudden five minutes in the light would be on like, why is the light on? I have 10 more minutes ago. It was [inaudible] been ceos in the room and they would let people know that flashed the light. Well, it was. It was a problem. It was a real problem. It's also the people that were running the comedy store. We're fucking retarded as well as the people that were running these agencies were fucking retarded. Like the

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       conversation that I had with my agents when they were telling me that I had to either apologize to him or they were going to drop me. I go, do you guys understand what you're doing? Because you're making a decision right now. You're calling it business. You're making a decision that's going to affect the rest of your life. You're supporting criminal and all you sell is art. All you sell is art. It's all you guys do. You don't. You don't produce widgets. You guys aren't building cars. You guys are set your sellers of other people's art. That's what an agent is and what you have here is a guy who's stealing art and selling it. You have a vampire and you're. You're taking this vampire. He will suck the blood of the creative geniuses that you have on your roster. But meanwhile the opposite has happened.

Speaker 1:          01:50:30       Louis C, k left them immediately. David tell left them. Nick Swardson left them with people that found out about them. What? Fuck this. Then he left them. So the whole thing was a disaster for Gersh from the agency at the time and you know that they've really never recovered. I mean it's, it's always a little bit. I left for other reasons. It was a fucking disaster for them. I mean, they lost a fuck load of money because of that one conversation that we had over the phone where I would've stayed with them. I'm like, if you want to defend this Douche bag, you know, I don't give a fuck. I've been my agent for years. You know, I liked the guy who, I'm not going to name him, he's a good dude. But he was being put into position by the guy who owned the company that like, look, this guy is calling me up saying he demands that, that joe apologize to him and he wants it to be a big deal and like, fuck you.

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       I'm like, I'd rather be homeless. And basically for people to really understand that the reason was because at the time he was a bigger star than you. Right. That's where the power play was. He was on. But I was big enough star that I couldn't be hurt by it. It was rich. I'm like, what are you going to do? I was on fear factor at the time. I had all this money and I'm like, you can't hurt me. And he tried. He tried to get me. He got me banned from the comedy store. He tried to get my agency and this is a person in me where I'm already untouchable in that sense, like really can't. You really can't dig in. Like, what are you going to do? You're going to try though. So if I was a young comic coming up, he would have had some real damage.

Speaker 1:          01:51:57       He could have done some real damage to me. Well, I'm sure there's probably untold amount of young comics that he lifted from that you have no idea of. Well, a lot of them contacted me while that was going on and some of them didn't want to be named and some of them didn't mind if I named them. But I think honestly that most likely he stole almost everything he did and that he stole it from different sources. And change it around, but you've got that with a lot of comics. You've got that over with a lot of, a lot of, like really shitty comedians make it. And one of the ways they make is they take other people's ideas and they move them around. Just enough. Look even good comics. Look, Robin Williams, who's, you know, has more talent or had more talented his finger then I probably have been my whole body. And that's well known deal. I know, I know a comment personally, you probably know them too, but I won't name him for the purpose of this, but who, uh, Robin's

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       stole a bit from, didn't he never told him but then just sent him a check. You send him a $15,000 check. He did that. So a lot of guys will get better as a performer than he was as a creative guy. Someone who came up with the ideas you've ever heard that phrase. Parallel evolution has that. Uh, so I had a comic when I was working in New York that I worked with almost every night and he started lifting from people and we all kind of knew at any, did exactly what you said it was like he would take the premise but then just tweak it enough that every time I'd be watching I'd go can't, you know, like, but, but we all knew and one night I finally confronted him, he's still doing standard by the way, and we've since become friends and he sort of apologized and whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:53:27       And he said to me one night, he goes, Dave, Dave, don't you know about parallel evolution. The premise being that with these jokes just evolve over, you know, if you're talking about sort of current event type things, we're all going to, a certain amount of it's just going to evolve at the same time was. And I said, I was about to say his name, but I said, uh, I said, not only are you lifting jokes, you also made up a theory that's pretty good. If you could apply that sort of creative thinking to your jokes, maybe we wouldn't be in this problem and that is part of the problem is that a lot of these people, they have a self defeating tendency and that's self defeating tendency is that they don't. They're not willing to put in the work because they're afraid of failure, so instead they see success and they just duplicate it and they literally duplicated in the premise, duplicate the premises.

Speaker 2:          01:54:11       They duplicate the pathway to getting to the end of the joke, but the one thing they can't duplicate is, you know what I mean, and that that's at the end of the day, that's all we have. Forget whether it's stand up or whether it's radio or on your, like what you have. The thing that at the end of the day they come to you is something that you can't really quantify, right? Like you just people understand a certain series of things about you that they like. So if the average person, why do you like Rogan? They could lay out a couple of things, but there's that other thing that just is there. They can't duplicate you bought in the case of a guy like Robin Williams. He can do all the things that you do that people like. Well, it becomes a problem because if he goes on before you. And that was one of the things that he would do, he would steal someone's bit and then bring them on because the comedy store, you tag team, you would go on and you would say, thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          01:54:59       Good night. All right this next comment because you know, and you'd bring up your friend, right? So no MC, no Mc at the comedy store. And he would bring on guys right after he did their closing bit and he would do it to fuck with them and he would do it because he had some power, you know? And because the Mexican community is desperately looking for star Comedians, I mean they have a, they have a few of them. Like George Lopez was always a big one. And Gabriel, Gabriel Iglesias is a big one. He sells out everywhere, but he's a really nice guy. And the difference being that men, ceos, not really Mexican, that was, you know, it was, he was completely concocted. Yeah. And that's what really did him in more than anything, it was a fake name. What? Wait, what was Israel? Israeli illness. And what about, what's the other one?

Speaker 2:          01:55:42       Uh, the one of the redneck guys were electric bob or frigerators south. The cable guy. And what's his real name? And he said, Dan Whitney. And it's like, yeah. But Dan was jokes. Yeah. I don't mind someone like dice clay's real name was in dice clay. Andrew Silverstein. I was at a party a couple of weeks ago and a dice was there and I was never a huge, huge fan of his. But I do remember around whatever that was, maybe 89 slash 90, maybe a little later when he sold out the garden. And when he was in that, you know, that year of just sanity. I remember watching that and thinking like, this is incredible. Like it was one of the things that really sparked me with standup because even though I didn't love the material and I understood that how stupid the jokes were sort of, but I was like, the power of this is fucking amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:56:30       And so I went up to him at this party and I tapped my shoulder and I just said, Dave comic, Blah Blah. He was like, yeah, good. And then walked away. Like I was like, wow. Because I've had such good. I'm sure you've had this too when you, when you've met comics over the years that you really admire. Pretty much every single one that I've ever admired. When I lived on the upper west in New York, I lived about two blocks away from Seinfeld, so I'd bumped into him a lot and he was a little hot and cold, but like basically like there was the comic bond, you know what I mean? Like, yeah. And I was just, dice was just, he was so over it. That's unfortunate because he's become his persona. Well, he's dressed them, but you know, he wasn't always that guy like that dressing, that whole thing.

Speaker 2:          01:57:11       That was a character in Andrew Silverstein's act like the dice man was a guy who would do that was basically Jerry Lewis and the nutty professor. Like if you've never seen the nutty professor, it's a great movie and one of the things that's great about it, it's Jerry Lewis is like this nerdy guy who takes a potion that was approached and it becomes this super cool daddio guy, you know, this is like 19 fucking whatever it was. 50 something probably, and it's a hilarious movie because you know, ultimately this guy becomes this guy that the ladies love and then the promotion starts wearing off and he goes back to being as nerdy self again and dice is that guy. I mean, that's, that's who he is on stage. While it was only a part of his act and then it became the best part of his act and then it became his act.

Speaker 2:          01:57:59       Then it became him outside. So like, so now you see him walking around the street, he's got the weightlifting gloves on. He just got a jacket with the fucking. It's got all the glitter on it and shut. It's be dazzled. I mean, it's, he's A. I, I have, I'm happy he exists though. I enjoy him for sure. And think about like the fact that at that if you watch that Madison Square Garden special, that all on youtube, you can watch it. People are announcing the jokes before he even finishes the premise. That was the power. That's where it showed to me the power of standup. Like I always loved. I remember what got me into standup was I was four years old, 1986, maybe 19, 83. I saw bill cosby himself on Hbo and I was on the floor even though I probably don't even really understand what he was talking about.

Speaker 2:          01:58:48       I thought this was the greatest thing ever. You know, you're growing up by the way, when your childhood hero becomes a serial rapist, most successful series of all time. Yeah. Um, but that, that sparked it in me, that sparked laughter and, and wanting to make people laugh and loving comedy for me. Uh, but the nice thing was like, Holy Shit, this is a real. Now I understand the show to um, well his standup was different in that not only did you know the punchline but the whole lines would sing a song. Yeah. So they wanted to hear the same jokes again, which is very different from other standup with stand up most of the time. You want to hear the new bits. Yeah. Well, you know, people want to hear shit they haven't heard before and I know that even talking about Cosby, it's hard to do at this point because everyone associates such terrible stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:59:35       But I did see him live a couple of times and one of the most amazing things that I ever saw a comic do ever was that, you know, everyone knew that whole himself special. Every comic loved it. Pretty much. So many from Chris Rock, the Seinfeld to a zillion people credit that with like being one of their seminal things and the records and all that. And I saw cosby maybe 10 years ago in Jersey and he was doing all new stuff and you know, it was kind of, you know, by his last 10 years, haven't been that kind to him and even just the way he looks and he's had some health things, like just what none of it was that great. But then at the end he goes, I'm going to do one old bit for you. And he said, I know you all know it.

Speaker 2:          02:00:11       I know you all know it, but I'm gonna do one little bit for you. And he did the dentist routine and everyone knew it, but he was such a master that he was, it was like watching him. It was like watching someone with clay because he could take the last before they were coming and then just change it enough to keep them going more. And they weren't yelling out the punchlines because it wasn't as, you know, like didactic or just set as, as a dice. But like it was, it was amazing to watch to do comedy and invent your old bit that you've now reinvented a thousand times. And they know it all and it was like as good as ever it was, it was amazing to watch his old stuff. I mean in the time it's. And that is a thing that you need to take into consideration when you watch standup standup, a sort of a, it's sort of a time machine.

Speaker 2:          02:00:55       It's a time capsule and like that's why you can go back and listen to Lenny Bruce who is arguably the most important standup comic ever. And he's not very funny. Yeah. It's just not, it's not very good today. And this is coming from someone who has lenny bruce posters framed in his house and I have Lenny Bruce live at the fillmore in, in my, uh, my office. I mean she's, in my opinion, the most important guy ever. Well he changed the art definitely simply. He just fucking tore that thing down. We are not going to do jokes like that. We're going to talk about real shit. And he opened it for everybody, period. And I think that's often the case with a lot of the greats. Like a lot of the old Carlin stuff is in that vein, like a, I understand its position in the, but if you watch it or listen to it today, it's really not that good.

Speaker 2:          02:01:42       You know, it's interesting the case with Cosby as well, so, so cosby for a while and especially now cosby has this other thing attached to them that it's, it just becomes impossible to remove it. It's so lined up together. Carlin, so I had Kelly Carlin on this week was a George's daughter who's a good friend of mine and we talked a lot. We talked about that and we related at all to everything else we've been talking about here, the social justice stuff and language and words and you know, being afraid to hear certain ideas and all that. So it was really, really interesting conversation. And uh, I watched a bunch of Georgia stuff just in preparation. I've seen it all a thousand times, but I thought actually a lot of it's still does some of it. Yeah, the seven dirty words sorta seemed ridiculous now in a certain way, but it's still pretty good.

Speaker 2:          02:02:23       Like, and even his last hbo special is fucking perfection. It, I, I, I've asked her this before. He knew his health was failing at the time. I don't think he knew he was gonna die only a few months later, but in a lot of ways if you watch it knowing that he perhaps thought it was his last special, it brings it to a whole other level because he ends it. Really just wrapping up, like wrapping up a 40 year. Here's what I think about everything. It's, it's pure brilliance. Well, he did a new special every year, so when you have that much material, you're going to have some hits and some misses. But he certainly had way more hits and he had messes. Sure. He had, he had like a five year, I think sort of low I guess maybe in the mid nineties or something where I thought it became just too much about cursing and whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:03:09       But beyond that, that guy, I think that represented a low in his life though you. He had some issues in his own life, personal life. But I, I'm, when I was referring to was his old stuff. If you go back to when he looked like a weatherman. Oh, you're talking about before he became the George Carlin, if you go back and put that time capsule and try to like wash that today, it's not really that funny. You know, who is really interesting. The old stuff is woody allen. Woody Allen's also, first of all, he's a fucking pervert and his old stuff. It's so weird. Yeah. Well look at all leaked into his movies, his strange sexual stuff and young girls and you know, you know, how old was Mariel Hemingway in, in Manhattan? She was, was first off, she played under age and I don't know how old she was.

Speaker 2:          02:03:54       Yeah, she was like 17 or something. How old was she? She was, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, but yeah. Umm, but comedy isn't in a weird way. Like here's, here's a good example. Uh, Eddie Murphy raw at the time was like this monster standup thing that everybody had to see. Oh my God, I saw it. I was crying. Try watching that today. First of all, you want to talk about homophobia, homophobia, but violently aggressively homophobic. Yeah. Which is really weird when you consider all the allegations that have surfaced since with him and transgender people and transsexuals and picking up hookers that were men like it's. It's very, very strange. Isn't it funny that we try to get. Look at Oscar Wilde said, you know, if you want to tell people the truth, you have to be funny. I think it was asking about. Maybe it was lily Tomlin.

Speaker 2:          02:04:41       My total. It's something I can't remember. One of them, I don't know how nice man, but you know, it's funny that we try as, as a society, like so many of the people that of course that we admired but that everyone is my are comedians because we're supposed to tell the truth. We are supposed to tell the truth and, and then at the same time, comedians are often either the sad clown or severely emotionally crippled or wanting that approval thing before and all the lines that you were talking about and it's a really bizarre place. So then when you get and you suddenly get all that approval and then it's like, can you still also grow as a human while you're getting approval for something that came out of some disfunction and I know this is the Angeles comedian discussion, you have to adjust what, why you do it, you know, you have to do it for other people instead of doing it for yourself and you have to do it for the, for the art, for the work.

Speaker 2:          02:05:37       And the work is profoundly enjoyable for people that love standup. It's like if you're a painter and you only paint for yourself, well you know at a certain point in time you're running out of shit to paint when you're painting, I guess expressing yourself or the desires of other people. I think then it becomes different. Yeah. I saw George Carlin once just a little bit before he died also on the view and he was talking about the art lord poor man. Guy took years off his life. We still have George today if you didn't make other thing that. I think he died that later that day.

Speaker 2:          02:06:10       But he said, he said something that I thought it was really great. He said, you know, he said when I became a good comment was when I got over the need. Yeah. And I think that it's a good lesson for humans in general, just for people like getting over the whatever the need is of yourself and we all struggle with this. Of course I struggle with it as a person and as a comic and a host or whatever it is. Like we all have that shit and, and wanting all that approval. But when you can get over that and just and really do things for the right clean reasons and, and live in and at the same time live in a way that honors all those things that you stand up for. I think that's like the secret, like that's the, that's the sauce. Like that's what we should all be trying to do at.

Speaker 2:          02:06:52       And it transcends, you know, professional transcends comedy and it transcends everything pretty much. Yeah. I think you're, I think you're onto it. And I think also that that process of like the need is, is that's the fuel that gets you off the earth and away from the effects of gravity and then the momentum of that sort of carries you on, but you don't necessarily have to keep that fucking jet engine fire under your asshole all the time. It's. But that doesn't, that explained sorta like a white angst and being fucked up or whatever it is. You know, when they say comics are all fucked up or whatever, you need a certain amount of that. Oh you do. To get going, you know. And for a look, I did stand up. Think about

Speaker 3:          02:07:35       this. I did stand up. We've only known each other for whatever it is, two hours now. I just signed up for about 10 years in the closet now. I was mostly doing political stuff and social stuff. It wasn't like I wasn't like outwardly lying all the time and being like, ah, fuck this chicken that, you know, like it wasn't like that. But like I constantly was avoiding the truth onstage or if, you know, if I was getting heckled, there were easy ways that I would insert it. Implied that I was straight or, and I'm sure time, I'm 100 percent sure there were times that I made it seem like I was straight or something like that, but that, that angst and that fuel really made me successful really quick. Like I was passed at the comedy cellar like a year into doing standup and then, and then a couple of years later, like it basically all crumbled on me because I realized that my life, my person life was way behind where my art was.

Speaker 3:          02:08:25       And then I ended up doing gay shows, which was another fucking nightmare because if you're a gay comic, they have one at every club, right? Like there's, there's sort of one like stereotypical gay comic. And then suddenly I was the gay comic and I don't act that gay, whatever the hell that means. So I wasn't even gay enough for them. And I ended up. Then I ended up on a gay TV channel on here TV, which was this like premium gay channel, and then I ended up on the gay channel on Sirius Xm. I want to talk about politics and instead I was fucking interviewing real housewives and all that shit and it had nothing to do with anything I wanted to do. Everybody's path is crazy and weird.

Speaker 4:          02:09:04       Well, your paths always going to be crazy and weird because we're human beings and I think you, you've, you're onto it as far as like this fucked up aspect of you that needs love so badly. You want to go on stage with a spotlight on you and a microphone to amplify your voice. Pay attention to me. Then once you get to that position, it's up to you to figure out the trick because if you're a music a magician and you believe that you're really pulling a rabbit out of a fucking hat, you're an idiot. You know, like you're, you're the guy with the trick and the trick is you know your voice is amplified. You're on the stage. You figured out the cadence and the hypnotic rhythm in order to get people to laugh at your stuff, but what? What? What are you actually trying to do?

Speaker 4:          02:09:46       If you're still trying to fill holes, will you? You fucking missed it, son. That's just supposed to get you to the dance and once you're at the dance, then it's supposed to be about creating the art and it's supposed to be about trying to figure out what is the best way to make something really funny? What is the best way to make something so I. I contribute to culture. I contribute to people's entertainment value. They go out, they can say, hey, Dave Rubin has had the ice house tonight. Let's go on out and have a good time, and they leave there and they go, that was fun. Oh my God. That was great. That's the goal. The goal is to. You're changing the way people feel and you can do that with ideas and you've got to work them through, but yeah, what gets you to the dance and the first place is you're fucked up past your angst, your insecurities. You're all that shit. It's a matter of the people that cling to those things and they'd never get 'em never get rid of them. Then they make it and they don't know what the fuck to do.

Speaker 3:          02:10:40       So that, that's the really interesting part to me because I lived on the upper west, as I said, put that microphone closer to you. You'll hear it more because we can hear each other. Yeah. When I get deep I start leaning into my left. Um, so I lived on the upper west, which is like a bastion of comedians. There's just a zillion comics that live up there. Seinfeld lived up there and Elayne boosler lived up there and uh, Taylor Negron who I met right before he died, didn't even know I met him just a couple of weeks before he was going to do my show. He was a great guy, great, great guy. Just a zillion and a lot of younger comics, whatever. But one, I used to see Greg Giraldo all the time. He lived a couple blocks away from me. And so I think you'll find this really interesting.

Speaker 3:          02:11:18       I didn't, I didn't know him personally, but he knew I was a comic. We just sort of nod when we were walking by and uh, one day I saw him walking, his two kids, he had his two young sons hand in hand and he was walking between them and I thought, wow, here's a guy who I respect as a comic, like doing good shit. He's funny, he's real. You could always tell there was like some pain there, but like doing it, you know, he's getting certain chances like I think he never got like maybe whatever would have been his big chance, but like it was, he was in the mix and respecting. Anyway. Then the next day after that I saw him, I went to Equinox, was the gym I went to on the upper west and I saw him there. He was working out and I was like, look, there's a guy just with his kids. He's working out like it's all seems like it's working for this guy. Like it actually gave me hope, like, oh, I can become like a functioning person that weekend, that weekend he was dead. I mean, I don't know enough about him.

Speaker 4:          02:12:12       Well, I know him and it was, it was a pill thing was a drug thing, you know, and that's, I'm incredibly unfortunate. I knew him when he had a television show because when Greg had, he, he had a show, um, because, you know, Greg started out as a lawyer and he had a show on one of the networks. I think NBC, I don't think so because I was on NBC at the time and I don't think we're on the same network. I think it was ABC, but it doesn't matter what matters is we were on the same lot. We're both on that sunset gower lot that I was talking about and we were next door to each other. So I'd hang out with them, you know, we're just fellow comics, you know, and that's the bond that we shared is it, you know, he had a lot more responsibility than me because I was on this giant ensemble where I was the fifth or sixth person on the. When the credits roll, you know, it'd be like Phil Hartman or Dave Foley, Mauritania. So I had no pressure, but he, he had the Greg Giraldo show, I don't remember what it was called, but it was, it was his show and he went from that and then he was really a big part of tough crowd with Colin Quinn. And there's that great moment where he's shut down. Dennis leary on tough crowd is like one of my all time favorite moments on tough crowd because Dennis was getting upset that Greg Geraldo had written jokes. He had funny things

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       to say about certain things. He goes, yeah, a Dennis. That's what we do. We write it, write jokes. And it was just a classic moment with Dennis is wearing sunglasses inside. Greg's like in the prime and Dennis has come in just horse shit. Yeah. Um, but he, he was a guy that I think was really respected by a lot of other comedians and was really good at roasts and in today's Day, you know, I mean, he died a few years back. He probably would be just right now crushing it like bill burris. It'd be right now like be in his stride because I think that what he was doing and what he was was really good. Yeah. But that, that goes to that. Thanks man. Demons. I mean think about that. Literally the day before, and I'm looking at this guy going, holy shit, he's doing it. That pill demon is a different, different monster than the, the opiate addict.

Speaker 1:          02:14:19       You know, that's a different monster. You know, the, the person who does meth or coke or you know, the people that go hard as a totally different monster. Yeah. It scares the shit out of me, man. I mean I smoked a ton of pot in my day, like pot yesterday. I got my card a couple of weeks ago actually. I went to the four slash 20 doctor on melrose. Wanted to get a prescription, isn't it? I thought I'd have to go through a battery of tests. Oh my God. It was like a day of like probing and I thought I was being taken by joking. By the way, folks, you want to be a fucking idiot to not get a prescription. So I could not believe how easy it was. I went in, I literally, I was like, ah, well I guess like, I just wanted weed to smoke weed.

Speaker 1:          02:15:01       I don't have any real physical elements, but I was like, I'll tell him I get headaches, my knees hurt after I play basketball, back pain. I mean the woman looked at me like, shut the fuck up. And then I went into. I had never been to one of the stories. One of the dispensary's went in there for. I still can't believe I've only been there a couple of times now, but I can't believe like just the level of, it's a real salesperson, you know, candy and edibles and oil, you know, careful. She wanted oils and uh, uh, so there's oils with a wax. I was like, you have any weed and weed for him. Like is there any, is that it left anymore? Like, just some bud. So I got, I got oil so it's all there. It's available. But yeah, the problem is once you, uh, once you go down to the first floor, you want to go, what?

Speaker 1:          02:15:44       Is there a basement then? Yes, there is a basement. What's that door in the basement. That's the sub basement. Let's look in the sub basement and then you start going deep and next thing you know you're in a spiral staircase. I have. How much pot these smoke? Um, I spoke a fair bit depending upon whether or not I'm at the comedy store or not. I enjoy getting high and going to the comedy store. I like to get high before I do Jujitsu. I liked to get high before I give the misses a stabbing. Nice to get high before I get an isolation tank. Isolation tank. I want to talk about that. I liked, I, I enjoy marijuana. Yeah, that's one of my friends. So I, yeah, I can tell you lit up. It was great. You know. So also I'd like the fact that I represent the opposite of the stereotype.

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       You know, you're doing shit. Yeah. I don't buy it. I don't buy that. Marijuana makes you lazy. I think you're fucking lazy. I think you could be lazy and, and eat cheetos. Does that mean cheetos make you lazy? You can be lazy and watch TV. Does that mean TV makes you lazy? I don't buy it. I think we're looking for some reasons why people have flaws and their personality and I don't think you could say it's marijuana because marijuana have all good aspects to it know, like many things. It's, it has good and bad. The bad thing is the memory, the memory thing is a bad thing. Like what, what were we talking about? But that's fleeting, you know, like longterm memory, long term memory is fucking fantastic. It has to be because of the UFC. Look, I have a, a bio when I do the UFC, which uh, will tell me like a fighters record tell me who they're training with and tell me.

Speaker 1:          02:17:15       But when the matches are going on, I'm not leafing through papers. If I start talking about a fight that happened seven years ago in another organization, it's because it's in my head, you know, and when I talked to people and they're like, what kind of preparation do you do? I'm like, I'm not doing any preparation, the preparation that I am, but I'm not the preparation that I'm doing. I would do anyway. I want to watch their fights because I know they're coming up so I'll wash their shit if I need to know about some of their training methods, but those, those are things that I will do because I'm curious about. I want to, I want to broaden my understanding of what their preparation is that because I want to enjoy the fight more and I enjoy the fight more if I do that and then I expressed that, but all that stuff is off memory.

Speaker 1:          02:17:55       It's there. Yeah. So when I'm doing like how much, how many notes do you have in front of you that I write zero on one. So if you hear me talking about old matches and stuff like that, all that shit is in my head because I have to have good memory and if I really thought that pot was fucking with that, I would stop smoking pot but it doesn't but it will fuck with like. Well we just talked about. Yeah, I know that it'll do that. What do you think twitter is doing that too? I'm a firm believer in that, that all of these things and having this phone constantly, that that's framing. I mean I'm talking really just splitting and disintegrating people's memory and especially short term memory. I see on my show all the time now. Anyone will, beyond just talking about anything that suddenly they forget what they're saying.

Speaker 1:          02:18:33       I'm not talking about 70 year old people. I'm talking about a 30 year old people. You know, there used to be a time if you were going to meet a buddy out for are you going to meet a girl for a drink or something? You're waiting on a corner and she's going to be. She's five minutes late. You'd have to stand there and just. Yup. And wait. Think about some shit. Look at the sky and the people watching whatever, but now you immediately, you immediately do it. You can immediately scroll and see an approval, approval, approval abroad. They loved me, they love me, they hate me, they love me. Whatever it is and all of that. And it goes to what we started with this whole thing about and six second videos and all of the shit and this bounce back of why people like this now is because all of this I really think is they've done studies where it's actually rewiring synopsis and all of this stuff. It's changing people's brains, uh, and that the Internet is actually having a physical effect on us that's not just starting next or hungover and done neck thing is real man. They're worried that

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       people are gonna like older people of our generation and before or are going to have real issues with their neck because they're always looking down. And that in looking down like that you're stretching the ligaments and stretching your neck and putting pressure on your discs.

Speaker 3:          02:19:43       Even when I'm holding my ipad I feel like I've done something to my pinky. Pinky has like, I'm not kidding, like I've got like two little indentations here because I'm holding this thing all the time like this, you know, I mean really people, you do all kinds of weird shit. How if you're writing, I'm a lefty. So like if I'm writing like I have a little indentation on my index finger because the power is always in there, like you actually can physically change your body by

Speaker 4:          02:20:06       some of this technological unquestionable. I used to have a from writing from drawing. I used to have a big callus on the inside of my fuck. You finger on my right a little extra. Well it was not, it was not that, but I mean it's just from. I drew like hours and hours every day when I was young and I always had these big calluses all over there and they've all gone away. Now. It's interesting how that happens. But to start drawing again. Yeah, maybe. But the neck thing is a real, real concern. The, I think it's gotten me, I mean obviously your eyes degenerate as you get older. That's the thing about close vision. But with me, I think it's got to be connected at least somewhat to staring at screens. I know that's bad for your focusing on any short term, like something that's really close to you.

Speaker 4:          02:20:50       And who the fuck was it? That was on the podcast that referred to it as like a cast. I don't remember who it was. Oh, it was a short term memory. Come on. Who is, who sleeps on the ground? Remember the chick who, uh, she doesn't sleep on beds and she's got this interesting. Cathy is her name. Cathy. Um, what Jamie, you'll find it. But anyway, the way she described it as she was saying that when you're staring Kathy Bowman. Yep. Yeah. Katy Bowman. Thank you. Katy Bowman. She that she said when you were staring at one distance all the time, just treating your face and your laptop or your face in your phone is that your eyes are supposed to look at clothes, things and far things and look at this broad range of distances and instead you're only looking at something right in front of your face and it fucks with literally shape of your eye. And then it's your, your, your body doesn't know what the fuck to do.

Speaker 3:          02:21:48       I mean, think about it. Our grandparents or even our parents. Well, my dad was born. There was no such thing as television. I'm 39 years old. That's insane, right? So our grandparents had no screens that didn't even have radio, right. Radio just maybe started, whatever. It wasn't a window radio started giving you. Right. Okay. So my grandparents were wars. Is that 19 twenties? Yeah. So I mean really think about that, how we've changed 100 years and as you were talking about earlier about how the Internet's going to change us and we're learning so much more faster and all that, but now it's so involved in this digital. I mean it's, the matrix is becoming real. Ultimately we're just the batteries for these things to keep going, you know, like they were just putting information. We're putting whatever our spirit is, whatever, whatever you want to call that is just the battery for this digital thing to exist. Do you know who Marshall Mcluhan says? I don't think so.

Speaker 4:          02:22:44       Fascinating thinker, an author from the fifties and sixties, I think it was, and he, he was a part of a. It was a part of the counterculture and a lot of ways a lot of people quote them, but one of the things that he said about this is technology before computers, he said human beings are the sex organs for the machine world and the idea that we exist to create these machines and I firmly believe that what we're doing is we are some sort of a technological caterpillar and we're giving birth to a new life form. I really, really believed that and I think that Elon Musk and what he said about summoning the demon in the form of artificial intelligence, I don't think that's off at all. I think there's gonna come a time, whether it's 100 years or a thousand years, human life and this biological, the biological limitations of our own cellular bodies. It's going to be ridiculous. We're, we're gonna. We're just gonna. Get rid of them.

Speaker 3:          02:23:39       Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's gonna be that long. 100 or if I forget if that was, that was, we're going to be long gone from this earth. I don't even think people won't be around a thousand years. Uh, I think we'll have, I think, no, I think a lot of people are probably going to die here on our dying planet and you know, rich people mainly are going to be able to escape with spaceships. Yeah. We're going to go to. Are we going? We're going to lie. I guess we've given up on the moon right now. We're going to, but we're going to go. We're going to find something. We're going to find something that has some of the basic building blocks of life like earth, you know, look, you know Carl Sagan, our, our, our son is not spectacular by any stretch and we know that there's billions and billions of sons in this galaxy and this university, you know, that whole thing and it endlessly extrapolates and all we are just a tiny rock with that had the right distance from the sun and the right amount of chemicals to make all this shit happen. We're going to find something that's going to be similar to this, but maybe it'll, it'll all be 10 degrees hotter. And because of that, everything will have evolved slightly differently. Or maybe you know, you could pick like I love star wars, you can pick any of those planets, you know, it just evolved differently. There'll be a planet that's know mostly water and will have to eventually learn how to deal with that unless the guys get here first and kill us, but possible to that is possible

Speaker 4:          02:24:55       spoke. But I think that our own biological limitations are on organisms are so acutely adapted to this environment, the environment of planet earth that it would be insanely difficult for us to colonize another planet and insanely, insanely problematic when it comes to dealing with whatever life has already. They're dealing with the environment dealing with that. It'd be better to just fix this spot. Well, I hope we fucking falling apart. Like we're like, we have a shitty old car and we're like, let's just abandon it and leave it on the lawn and move to the neighbor's house. I mean that's really the idea, but the neighbor's house is on fire all the time and it gets pelted with asteroids. I think we're going to put all of our effort into flying to some other planet and on the way there their son's going to Supernova and then we're going to blow up in the middle of space and I'll hope will be lost. That's what I think people have been inspired by this conversation and now you've people back here on earth. We're just going to regroup and go, you know what? Let's stop trying to go to space and just clean the ocean. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:25:58       I really think are something about humans. Something about look right now, like even if we cut, and again I'm not a scientist, we'd even when we cut our greenhouse gases here in America and we do all this stuff, India, these developing nations, China, they're going through what we went through 60 years ago. So when we have the UN meet and try to get everybody to come up with numbers that we're going to allow to put out this much smog and this much. All this bullshit. It's like, what right do we have to tell them not to do everything they can to advance just the way we did 50 years ago. So. No. So it's funny and I live in West Hollywood. There are no plastic bags. Right. And they don't even want to give me a paper bag at trader Joe's anymore. You know, you have to pay for it, you have to pay for it. And that's. I mostly just pay for paper bags at this point. They hate me too because I never bring my own bag. I'm a fucking bad ass. I pay that ten cents for that.

Speaker 4:          02:26:47       They hate you for that. Yeah, you can see it. The judge, the horrible judge. I need those paper bags. I use the paper bags. Recycling in them. Yeah. Well that's also how I light the fire. When I use my grill, I stuffed the paper bag underneath the little charcoal chimney I use. Yeah. Well they'd hate you for that. Oh fuck them. Short sided bitches.

Speaker 3:          02:27:07       Yeah. Anyway, the. I just think the, the earth. I Dunno, I dunno. I think 100 years they'd be hard for me to believe that things could still be going on around here.

Speaker 4:          02:27:16       Well, 100 years ago, you'd be amazed at what progress has taken place. Socially. You'd be amazed. I mean, think about that. Think about 18, 65 was the last time slavery was legal, right? Think of that. I think that's an awful long time. Long time ago now. That's almost 100 years. Exactly. From when I was born. I was born in [inaudible] 67, so 102 years later I was born after sleep, but that's nothing. A 100 years is not that much time. I think that a thousand years from now who the fuck knows what kind of technological capabilities we're going to have as far as our ability to not just not create waste, but to use up all the waste that we have created and use it in a positive way. Just because you burn gasoline, it creates pollution. It doesn't mean that's the only way you can get energy and just because pollution is in the air, carbon dioxide is hitting record levels. It doesn't mean that can't be maintained and regulated. I think there's gotta be a way that people can figure out how to live sustainably if it's possible to live sustainably in a small community. It's possible to live sustainably globally, so when you do it for yourself, like

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       when you hunt for your meat and you were Tommy, have chickens before. When you. When you do all that stuff, do you feel that you're doing it for yourself or you're doing it for your community or is it 50 slash 50

Speaker 4:          02:28:32       zero and be totally honest? Zero for my community, zero for the earth. I'm just thinking what's the best way? This is just my, my intent going in. I understand that it's better for the earth, but my intent going in is like I don't want to rely on other people for my food. I don't want to rely on some farmer to not shove antibiotics and hormones and the food. I want to be able to eat clean, healthy food. Also, ethically, I don't want to be a part of the factory farming system. I think when I watch these youtube videos, he's peta videos on how they raised pigs and cows and it's fucking evil. I'd rather shoot a wild pig. I'd rather. I'd rather eat moose, you know, I think it's better for you to the protein wise, the protein content of elk and Moose is far higher than the protein content of beef. It's better for you. You can eat smaller portions. You get more out of it. I just, for me, it gives me a better feeling. I know where everything came from when I eat a steak that I cut from an elk myself. That is such a different feeling than when you go to the supermarket and you get something of ambiguous origins and plastic wrapped container and just take it home and cut open a plastic and slap it on the grill and. Or I'm out here growing locker man. So you know

Speaker 3:          02:29:48       trader Joe's that when you get just chopped me from trader Joe's, it comes from four different countries. They have four countries of origin on it. For beef, for beef, go right now. Countries. Yeah. You could go. Maybe we can google it, the that it, it's coming from, you know, United States, something like the United States, Canada, Mexico, and then like something that we're not even geographically connected to and then I guess they package it all here. But think about that like, you know how we're so disconnected from our food that when you eat a freaking burger from trader Joe's, it came from for country. I'm not making this up. We,

Speaker 4:          02:30:25       I believe you. I didn't think. I wouldn't think you were making it up, but I shouldn't say I'm surprised because if it's cheaper to do it that way, that's how they're going to do it. In trader Joe's is known for having fairly inexpensive food. Shouldn't say cheap because it's all good, but like whole foods, one of the things that are like about whole foods, people say whole foods is expensive. It is expensive, expensive, but they'll show you like the farm where the beef is being grown and you can choose how you want it. Like you can choose, like I did a bordain show the other day. We're, we're hunting pheasants in Montana for an upcoming episode and we were talking about steak and he was like, you know what I mean? Everybody says, Oh, you have to have grass fed, grass fed. He goes, I like a fatty steak. He goes, I like steak. That's a. That eats corn I think. I think it tastes better and a lot of ways, but they give you options. They give you. That whole tiered system shows you exactly where the meat is coming from, how it's. There's a fucking photo of the farm,

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       like they show you the farm where these things are being raised in, in. It's more expensive to eat sustainable food. It is. It's more expensive. These hunts that I go on doesn't cheap. The effort is way more. I mean if I, if I shoot an elk, it's gonna take me five or six days to put it all together to get one and then you have to process to mean Carey and freeze it. And do you do all of that or do you have people? I assume you have somebody helping you. It depends on. Some of them have done all of it on, on, on other ones. If I'm traveling, I'm flying. What I can do is do a lot of it and then bring the remaining pieces, a quarter it and bring the quarters to a meat processor and ask them to turn it into steaks or turning into sausage or have things like that done.

Speaker 2:          02:32:03       But the big cuts like the back straps and the tenderloins and stuff like that. I do all that myself. The heart and the liver. I cut all that stuff out myself and then I bring it with me. I freeze it and you know, if you want to see how crazy the food system is. Also you could check, you know, there's so many documentaries on this, but the amount of laws that we have that protect the factory farming from simple things like having cameras in where the chickens are illegal, things that purdue is getting away with. I always think purdue to me is like the worst of the worst because if you watch their commercials, and this goes to what we were talking about with the, with the drugs and the happy people during the day and then they're having diarrhea and killing each other, whatever, like the, the, the purdue commercials.

Speaker 2:          02:32:45       You've got this guy come out, he's hanging out with chickens, you know, he's talking to them. Oh there is Bernadette. And did they still have. They still do all that stupid shit he was. Or sometimes it's a cartoon and he walks in the morning. What he doesn't say is that he just, he's about, you know, it's like a Holocaust is going on in there. He's killing all the chickens and he's going to kill them, but we have somehow like that's how marketing is so crazy. We don't let cameras in to watch them rip the beaks off and not let them in. It's illegal. So think about that and can get arrested. What does that have to do? Why would the government, why would our government that's supposed to have our best interests at heart? Right. I guess that's the government supposed to have a. Why would they pass that kind of law?

Speaker 2:          02:33:26       A lot of money to be made. Exactly. If you want to go to General Motors and you want to film them putting together a Camaro, of course love it. They look at what the tour is, how we do it, why? Because no fucking babies are getting crushed other making Camaro's, but if you want to go to a pig farm and film it, you can go to jail. Like these are new laws that have been passed because of whistleblowers and those laws are evil. That's evil. I mean that should be transparent. One hundred percent. You should be able to know exactly where your food is coming from. There's only one way to do that. Yeah. I mean we've done so many things between feeding these animals, all sorts of shit that they shouldn't be eating. Have you ever drove, drove up? I think it's a five. If you're driving up towards San Francisco.

Speaker 2:          02:34:11       He passed Harris ranch, Harris ranch. I think if I'm not mistaken, it's the largest. A meat producer in the United States are the largest meat producing ranch in the United States, and when you pass it, they call it cow shit. I mean, that's how there is so much. It stinks of death. I mean pure death, right? You've smelled that for a good mile or two. You can see it in the air. You see these dirty animals that can barely move. I mean, I love meat on my twitter from last night I had grass fed steaks cooked on a whole Himalayan salt plate. I love me. Right? But after that I was like, Jesus, like this is serious. That's when I got on at least doing the grass fed free range thing. Well, this is like, I can't be part of this, but I know it's about money. Well, it's not just about money.

Speaker 2:          02:34:58       It's about volume. Like when you have a community of 20 million people across Los Angeles and none of them are growing their own food. Yeah, they're going to need food and where's that food going to come from? It's going to come from somebody else that grows up food and we'll how they're going to grow that food. They're going to grow that food in the most cost effective and efficient way possible, which means stuff. These fucking animals into these cages. Unless you demand something different and well, if you do demand something different, you're going to have a higher price because then these companies aren't going to be making much money, so they're going to have to charge more money for the meat and then people can afford it and then it becomes a problem. But if you wanna be able to go to in and out burger or in and out.

Speaker 2:          02:35:32       It's not a good example because it takes a little time, but like Jack in the box, pull in, get up, ground up beef sandwich within 30 seconds. Yeah, look, there's only one way to do that. You know, you got to do it with a massive factory. You have to be churning these fuckers out, hanging above their ankles and putting pest piston, you know, through their brain every 30 seconds. I mean that's. That's got to be chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk. You got to be constantly wiping them out because there's so many people that are hungry. How do you think we get people to wake up on this? Because what we did, we covered. We covered on my show. Sometimes it's one of the things that I bring on camera to talk about our food sources and the way that these, you know, you were eating sick animals and then we wonder why we're sick.

Speaker 2:          02:36:11       Like it's all. Of course it's all connected. You open up a thing of meat and it's great. Why is it great? Why would you put that in your. Why would you put that in your body? But this is one of those things. It's like our, the level of our discourse in America and the level of the nonsense on cable news and they can keep us distracted with Kim Davis issues and they can't keep us distracted with all of this nonsense and I don't think it's necessarily like some big conspiracy of keeping us distracted as much as it's what we are as humans is this endless distraction. There's just this endless distraction and you got a pill for some truth out of it. You gotTa Pill for some way to find something that works for you, so I don't know that they can ever fix it because it's. We're just in it. I don't even know if it's an endless distraction. I think that life has too many variables. It's almost impossible to consider all the variables, so you're going to build your own shelter, you're going to figure out your own electricity, you're going to run your own wires. Are you going to fix your own washing machine? You're gonna build your own washing machine. You know what? Where are you going to get it? We're going to get the parts. Are you going to the metal? It's like there's so

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       many things involved with living a comfortable healthy life in 2015 in the city that you're going to be responsible for all aspects or just is it just going to be food sourcing? What about sewage? What about waste disposal? What are you going to do about all that stuff? You're gonna, you're gonna. Look into that or you just going to like flush your shit down the toilet and hope the guy at the other end knows what to do. That's essentially what it boils down to. This super complicated civilization that has been created. You can say we've created, but it's we're, we're riding on the momentum of the people that came before us and those people that came before is oftentimes didn't know what the fuck they were doing. Didn't plan for the future. Certainly didn't think that mean when I was a kid in the 19 seventies there was like $100, million less people in this country think.

Speaker 4:          02:38:04       Just think about that. Think about the numbers between like 1975 and 2015. There's more than. I think it's more than $100, million more people just in this kind of baby boomers had all those kids. It's insane. And then there's India that's exploding population of China. Massive population to the point where they're, they're trying to limit the amount of babies that people have. I mean, we live in a very, very strange time in that people are awakening to all the problems that have been created by this massive amount of people and this incredible need for resources, but at the same time you're working eight hours a day plus plus commuting, plus hobbies plus sexual needs and entertainment needs and friendships and every poll and push and oh well you've got to have civic responsibility. Guess what, Dave Rubin, we need you for jury duty. You can't catch up.

Speaker 4:          02:38:58       You can't catch up. And we, we, we operate on this fucking constant momentum with very little quiet time and that's things that I love to this thing. That's what I loved the most about those sensory deprivation tank because I get that quiet time that you don't get, you know, I get, I get time for reflection. How often? How often are you doing it? Well, I have it in my house. Oh Man. So I do it all the time. Wow. That is really cool. Yeah, I think everyone should do it. Just to try, just to feel what it's like to just be alone with your thoughts because it's the only time you're actually alone with your thoughts because you're not. Your body isn't even registering. Is there a lock on that thing? No. I would be freaking out the entire time. No, I know, but doesn't make sense, but like would there be some reason that it could lock?

Speaker 4:          02:39:42       No. Yeah. I was not even a latch. There's not even a door handle or anything. It just pushes open and push his clothes got. How long do you go in there? For? As long as I want. Usually at least an hour usually, but sometimes two hours. I know for the first 20 minutes of being in there, I'd be like, is this thing locked? Did I get lost? Like it would be a lot. Even if I was alone, I would just be fearing. That's funny. You'd get used to it. It's like everything else. It's not scary at all. It's relaxing. What is one of those run yet? It's expensive. A cheap one for like. Well, I think there's a company called Zen float that makes a small personal one that Duncan has in his house. I think that one is still fairly expensive, but it's like 1500 bucks. I got the top of the line. Bad Mama Jama float lab version, which is like 30 grand. Wow. Really expensive. But mine is seven feet tall, nine feet wide and it looks like a meat locker. It's like it looks like a gigantic freezer that you step into, but it's perfect.

Speaker 2:          02:40:37       I'd like to see the compound that you live on. I feel like there's a lot of cool between the chickens slash and there's elk. Yeah. Yeah. Before archery range because that's 100 yards in my yard. Rubber pigs and rubber elk and I have an ikea couch. Yeah, I built it. I don't want to. I don't want to brag, but it's an l pretty, pretty sweet. I was reading this thing that was a. They were talking about people they experience more satisfaction in the ownership of things like Ikea because even though it's not like good furniture, it's not like the best furniture. The fact that they put it together themselves gives them a sense of satisfaction that I think we're kind of missing and part of our culture, like someone who built their own house and built their own furniture and they sit in their own house, their own furniture probably gets like a deep feeling of satisfaction about that.

Speaker 2:          02:41:28       Well, I can tell you as someone that has almost all Ikea, you know, it's funny. It's taken me. I started, I'm 39. I started standing up and right when I got out of college, Ninety eight had radio shows. Like it's been a long, long journey. I finally, for the first time in this past, it's really in the past six months and only in the last couple months that I really feel like I'm sort of on the other side for the first time and I know that that feeling never goes away and I probably just jinxed it on your side. And what went well. The other side meaning like I feel like I've, I'm here somewhere like I'm in the career. Like I really have something and know what I'm saying and know what I'm doing. And being rewarded for it financially and personally and by my audience and stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:42:08       But I'm not rolling in dough by, by any stretch. I'm going to make six figures but like, but I'm doing good. Right. You're not scared. I'm not. Yeah. But the fear, it's always there. The fear factor, so to speak. I think it probably never leaves the moon. I have a friend of mine who's on a huge Sitcom. She's making a boat load of money and she talks to me about it all the time. She's like, it could be gone tomorrow and then what? And then what am I left it. So I have some money now, but like, you know, what am I left with? Um, but I do aspire my, my house is pretty much 90 percent Ikea. Like I want to get to 100. No, I want to get to the point when there's no, I want to get to 10 percent. I mean like my couch is Ikea. My bed is Ikea, my futons, Ikea. The Shit in my kitchen is Ikea. Like that would be to me success like designer furniture. But because the ikea couch more than anything is, is painful. Not Good. It's not good. No. That might be what my neck hurts. It's not because of my. I be that as well. Yeah. But that. But, but you know like I'm but also like there's

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       a lot of truth in that like that. I feel like it's sort of started working and I was just looking around my place the other day. Like maybe the next phase will be like a little bit more something. Well I feel like it's a rabbit hole that you have. You have to be really careful when they step in because it will suck your time up. This hunting thing suck my time up. If I went into the manufacturing my own furniture thing, like doubting my own wood and milling it and so and unfortunately I have friends that are professional woodworkers, you know, I, I know like that. It is possible to learn all that stuff and then build furniture. You could do it, but then you'd have to say, okay, well am I going to weave my own cloth to cover this furniture? You turn it on your own butter.

Speaker 4:          02:43:55       I mean, what are we talking about? Going to use the elk that I killed for the leather that covers the couch and I'm going to have to kill quite a few animals to populate my house. The whole thing would be a blood bath, nuts, a lot of work. So a lot of work. Or am I going to get one of them crazy Indian weaves, you know, when you'd like to have the yarn, you pull it through and you push it down and make your own cloth. Yeah. It's a lot of fucking words. Do you feel like you're there and that place, that place on the other side where you've sort of built what you wanted to build and, and your life and your work and all of the sort of lined up? No, I don't think that, yeah, I might think like that. I don't worry about money.

Speaker 4:          02:44:33       Yeah, don't worry about money. But um, I worry about work in, in that I want to make sure that everything I'm doing is good. Whether it's podcasts or whether it's stand up or whether it's doing my commentary. I always want to make sure that I'm not doing bad stuff and that if I, if I have done something that's not that good, I make sure that that doesn't happen ever again or that if it does happen again. I learned from that one too and then it gets better even there. So there's that. Like, it's not like shit I gotta pay my bills, but I do remember that feeling bad and I also remember the moment that that went away. How free it was. Like I got a development deal when I was like, I don't know how many years in economy, but it's like 93 and I got a big check from Disney of all people and all of a sudden I didn't have to worry about how I was paying my rent all of a sudden for at least the next year or so, or a couple of years it was paid and it was like this silence, like this weight.

Speaker 4:          02:45:30       Just literally a physical weight lifted off my shoulders. And then I thought about it and I said, man, you know what? Some people never get to that place. They live their life from cradle to the grave, constantly under the pressure of bills, check to check, and that that freedom of not worrying about your bills is massive and people trip themselves up by putting themselves in debt and by getting in over their head, giving themselves a bunch of shit that they don't need. Then they have to pay for it or they buy it on credit and they have to fucking don't worry. I'll figure out a way and that that pressure is overwhelming for people. When that pressure went away, it was replaced by the pressure to try to do good stuff,

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       to try to do things that I can be proud of, to try to do things. Where are you doing that already? Yeah, but I was trying to do it and I was worried about making money at the same time and as soon as the worry about making money kind of goes away. Then your. You're left with a pure sense of why you're doing it. So isn't that for all the things that now we put out there, podcasts, video, audio, all that stuff. Owning your brand, all the. All the things that you do, I know I hate it to a boy on your brand. People say this, I want to run from them. Yeah. How do you manage your brand? Somebody asked me to do a seminar on that really recently. Well, you're not worried about money, so I guess he didn't have to be pretty good.

Speaker 2:          02:46:49       I don't think you make much money on those seminars. Seminars, pay, you know who, who gets money? The people that run the seminar to the pimps. I'm sorry. Yeah. No, uh, but that, that's the beauty of all this stuff. So you built this whole thing and then you're free. You, you answered it yourself, you know, this is a very unique time for people like us because finally, all of this exists so that we can control our destiny. You know, and I'm, I'm attached to a network or has been really good to me. As you said at the beginning. They let me do whatever I want. I mean, literally they sat me down the day before the show started, an executive who I'd never met in person before. Said he's like, I have one thing to say to you, make the show you want to make, not to show you think we want you to make.

Speaker 2:          02:47:28       What is your show on? What is it on TV? What does that? Which is Larry King's digital network. Larry King has his own digital Mary King. It's with partners with Carlos Slim. Is that Carlos Slim Jim? They said, no, he's not. He's even richer than that guy. They say he's the. He was either the richest or second richest man in the world. He's a Mexican telecom billionaire. Yeah. He partly. When's The New York Times now and a bunch of other stuff. They're part digital network and part production company. So William Shatner as a show there. Jesse Ventura as a show say. Well, I mean, as I said, I'm not. I'm not making six figures like pause and I'm not making six figures, but they let me do it at King's almost dying. Come crash. Oh, oh. To the hounds. Yeah. He's been very good to me. You know what? I'll tell you, I'll tell you what.

Speaker 2:          02:48:16       I want to hear better numbers. Believe me. I want to get better at ovaries do, but actually this is the first deal that I ever had my agent close for me and because I'd always done even my Sirius xm deals, I did myself and my podcast deals. I'd always done everything and when my agent did this, it was. I didn't realize how hard it was going to be for me to let go and be like, Oh, I'm supposed to trust you to actually do a deal now. That was really hard for me to actually say, you know, but that's. But that's how you mature in this thing. You gotta you gotTa have a good agent. I told you my issue that I had with the agent when dementia thing went down, but I've had the same manager scrub. I was just a kid in my early twenties to know what the fuck I was doing that was able to since I was an open mic.

Speaker 2:          02:49:04       Wow. That's where I got really lucky. My, he found me in Boston when I was make people laugh and he saw something that he thought and we worked together ever since and we've been. He's one of my best friends. He's a great friend, so, but because people are, I think people always confuse her to the manage your aging thing. A manager really is sorta like it. A lot of respects should be your friend and your guru and you're sort of helping you down that road. The agent is getting you gates, but sometimes they're not. I mean I have friends that have just really fucked up relationships with their managers and when you're not doing well, the manager can be a real hard to get on the fringe, codependent relationship. You're saying the people in this town can be fair weather friends can't listen. We're almost out of time, but I really.

Speaker 2:          02:49:50       Before we leave a half to talk to you about one thing that you told me that I think is when you do start doing well, then your. They're your buddy. Like it's an incestuous reared fucking very strange codependent relationship. You're saying that people in this town can be fair weather friends that we're listening, we're almost out of time, but I really, before we leave a half to talk to you about one thing that you told me that I think is incredibly fascinating. You came out literally the to someone for the very first time, the day before September 11th, the night it was. It was about midnight of September 11th, so meaning September 10th. It just rolled into September 11th. The first person ever came out to a brilliant comic who you've never heard of and I don't even know what happened to him. This guy, Mike Singer, was one of the best comics that I ever knew.

Speaker 2:          02:50:37       We worked for years together. Sky was wickedly funny. I think he lives in Columbia now or something. You're not doing standup. Anyway, he was gay and he was so. I in a way, I was ahead of my time in terms of being out as a comic that doesn't necessarily play into every stereotype and all that. This guy was really ahead of it because he was 15 years older than me and had done it already. Anyway, we were in the time square subway. I was going back. I lived on the upper east at the time. I was walking to the shuttle thing to go to get on the east side and I had. I was just a fucking complete mess. It's, it's incredibly hard to live one life to live one life on this planet is a hard thing. Try living too at the same time and that's what I was doing because I had my life that everyone knew and then I had this secret life where I was out, you know, hooking up and I was lying to people constantly.

Speaker 2:          02:51:29       Even though I never intended to lie. I would be somewhere and I bumped into a friend and I'd be with a guy, a gay person, and I could just, oh, that's my cousin. Like it just, it was incredible. I'd never really, I mean I never intended to lie to people or it just became this really horrible game of cat and mouse and I was depressed and I was smoking pot and all this shit anyway. Um, and then when it, when it really, so that, as I said earlier, you know, that that was the fuel for good comedy for a long time. And then eventually it just started sputtering. It was like I wasn't happy, I wasn't full. I wasn't, couldn't bring those things to the stage

Speaker 3:          02:52:05       anymore. And just my life was a fucking disaster. Anyway, about midnight, just eight hours before the first plane hit, I'm in the time square subway station with my friend. I told him I was gay. I don't think he realized even though this guy knew me for years, I don't think he realized that. I don't think I said, Oh, you're the first person I'm telling or something like that. Like I just said it and we just, we talked for two or three minutes and he's like, all right, I'll talk to you later this week or something. And I go home and I woke up. I turned on the TV in America is under attack and I kid you not like I was smoking a lot of pot at the time. I was not mentally right. Like I wasn't. I remember probably a few weeks before that I was walking to the subway and by living two lives I felt I felt like a crazy person.

Speaker 3:          02:52:53       It's hard to describe. The only way I can describe it was I remember walking down second avenue and it looked like all the buildings were shaking like I was. I felt centered like I was okay, but literally you'd felt like the world was being ripped apart. That was like the, the level of disconnect I had with reality at that point. Like, you know what I mean? Like if you can't express your love properly, if you can't, you know. That's why we started this whole thing talking about all these guys that are jacked and working out all the time and whatever. It's like, that's what I said. It's very sad to me because these are people who could not express a very human thing in a proper way. So they end up acting out at 45 in a way that they should have acted when they were 15, partying and having a great Milo Yiannopoulos.

Speaker 3:          02:53:38       What do you have against a math? Well, Milo, who you had on a couple of weeks ago and I had them on the day or two after. I mean we argued about that. Me As the liberal, the gay married liberal who's for that traditional thing and him as the off the wall, British gay, conservative who's against gay marriage because he wants to talk about drugs and partying and sex and whatever. So that's why I love talking to him in all honesty. And I really enjoyed talking to Milo. He's trolling and so many different ways simultaneously winking at you the entire time. That's the audience. I think the audience is aware of it. And if he was sitting right here he wouldn't answer, isn't aware of it. I don't think, Oh, these people are idiots.

Speaker 3:          02:54:16       But anyway, so I woke up and I, I kid you not, Joe, I kid you not. I thought it had something to do with me. I thought we were like the world was attacked or we were under attack because that I finally express this thing that I had, the secret that I had had that it was so bad that being out caused the world to collapse. I know that even saying that now, I've always told this publicly maybe twice, like it sounds completely fucking insane and it's. That was. And it is insane. But like that's where my head was at and, and interestingly after that, the way I dealt with coming out was I would tell someone and then I would get this little burst of feeling better. I would suddenly [inaudible] you. I was like constricting my heart and when I would tell someone it would, it would open up a little and I'd feel better and I could.

Speaker 3:          02:55:03       I really could feel like I could breathe better, like really felt better. And then I would wait until that pressure would start building again. Sometimes I would wait months and then I would tell someone and then I would do this over the course of like two years. And then eventually I realized, I was like, you know, every time I tell somebody this thing that I think is horrible and they're pretty much okay and I feel better, I was like, I gotta end this, it's time to end this now. And that's, that's basically when I told the remaining people. And that was it. It's a weird secret because the people that do care that don't like it, they're not worth knowing and nobody, literally nobody, nobody that I told, you know, my dad struggled for a little bit or you know, whatever. This and that. My a lot.

Speaker 3:          02:55:43       The thing that mostly people got was that nobody believed I was gay. That was like, my mate, will you play basketball? You play basketball, you know, like that. So nobody could believe like they just don't seem gay. Like I don't like to dance, I don't dance. I learned my dancing from Cosby, like that's my move, you know? So all of that. So that was the main thing. Everyone was just sideswiped. So a lot of times people will say to me, you know, you're straight or you're straight acting or saying, which in the gay community is thought of. It's like this great thing, you know, they're a pure, straight acting your masculine. It's really great. But I don't, I don't take it that way because every time someone says it to me, it makes me feel like a freak, you know what I mean? Like why am I.

Speaker 3:          02:56:24       Yeah. Because I am who I am. This is it. You know what I mean? Like, like I had gay sex last night after I had that grass fed beef, you know? And so I'm gay, I'm married to a guy there. It sounds like a gay person that's a pretty gay married to a guy would say that's pretty gay. That's what I realized. I was like, Oh, I'm marrying this dude. Like I guess, but you know what I mean? That was like, Holy Shit. Like I guess, well, you know, turning it back now. Um, it was a phase I was renting. Yeah. This is a long way. I'm really like, you know, it's dragging out this phase thing, but I realized that if I felt better when I told people that, that there had to be some value in that in a way that I couldn't understand things, but, but to the, to the straight acting like it means nothing to me when I meet guys that are completely flaming or if I meet guys that are, that you'd have no idea.

Speaker 3:          02:57:15       Like I like people based on their values and their sense of humor and like shit like that. I never asked to all people that matter as as. Yeah, and you know what? That's a great way to bring this all around because that gets away from judging people on what you're supposed to think about them and all that social justice warrior and regressive bullshit versus judging people on the content of their character and also gets back to what we're saying earlier that it's like it's just being aware socially being a good person to communicate with versus being socially retarded and just looking for those Ben Affleck Brownie moment. Yeah. Let me toss in one other thing that sort of ties into this really nicely, so one one time when I was on the young Turks, and I'm not gonna mention names here, but I was on and they were showing a clip from Fox News and they were talking about how the host that he was such a token black guy.

Speaker 3:          02:58:03       He was such a token black guy and actually know the guy. This guy, David Webb, who I used to work with at Sirius Xm. I'm pretty good friends with him. I had dinner with him last week. He is a black conservative. He is a conservative. I know him. I know what this guy believes. He spends hours on the air every day professing his beliefs and that's what. That was another. This happened a little bit after that whole Sam Harris thing, but that was another moment when I realized how perverse this whole progressive thing is that here you have people on the left that are supposed to be about ideas, looking at the color of that guy's skin and saying, well, because you don't believe what I think you're supposed to believe. As a black person, you're a token black, you know, we've all done that, you know, like when they showed like a Republican convention and there's one black I talking about, but I realized that's actually racism like that was.

Speaker 3:          02:58:53       That was really a seminal moment for me that really changed my thinking because I was like, this is crazy. I know this person personally. This is a friend of mine and I know he believes he's not doing this because he's a token black. This is, this is what he believes, and you as the on the left are pointing at this guy and saying, you're different than what I think you're supposed to be black guy, so you must be a token or you're an uncle tom or a sell out or something. And also all of this, when you have the gay stuff, the social justice or either the regressive stuff like judge people based on what they say, what they say and what they believe. Nothing else. That's it.
