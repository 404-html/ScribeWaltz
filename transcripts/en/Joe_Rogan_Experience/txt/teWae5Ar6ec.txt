Speaker 1:          00:00:13       Joe rogan experience podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:00:18       Why can't, why can't that work?

Speaker 3:          00:00:21       It was. The computer is restarted in it. Every time this computer restarts, all the sounds fucked up on it.

Speaker 2:          00:00:27       We will soon be free of this technological nightmare and into a new one. And Gentlemen, we've got to try castor coming. We tried to order the Sony thing, but it didn't work for us. It just wasn't for streaming. It wasn't the right piece of equipment. So we're getting a tri caster, but John headphone don't give a fuck about that. Ladies and gentlemen, John have fraud comic standing. Hilarious comedian. It's been awhile. It's been awhile since I've been on here. It's been a while since I see you. First Time I saw you at the store. So we haven't seen each other in two years. Three? Yeah. Yeah, because I had to do that thing where you tax them, like who? I don't even know what I mean. And then like all my famous friends, I never put their names in my phone as their real names. Who am I? I would probably, I think probably don't tell me because then yeah. Yeah. So just just in case, not that I'm, I'm like, but just in case you lose your phone, like I was wondering like really famous people who have famous friends like Paris Hilton loses their phone all the time and then two people hack into it and get Lindsey Lohan summer. I mean it's kind of hard to hack into an iphone unless it's connected to the cloud. Right. Like if they got ahold of it, probably be pretty difficult.

Speaker 3:          00:01:40       Crack your pass code. They actually I think have programs I teach, they're just logging in and I'd like taxi drivers I think do it and it turns off all the tracking and then they resell it like immediately. Really? Yeah. Because I've had, I've had the cloud on my girlfriend's phone and she left it in a car and like in five minutes it was already disabled. It never turned back on.

Speaker 2:          00:01:58       Yeah. Well the thing. I bet you're right because the thing is they have a lot of places that buy cell phones now. Yeah. I don't know if they ask like, is this yours? I don't know. But uh, I've seen places that, by cell phone. Have you ever sold an old cell phone?

Speaker 3:          00:02:13       No, because I'm paranoid because I know you can just take anything off a phone like that. Like I could take her phone even though you've deleted it and even reused it for six months. I could still take stuff off of there for like two years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       Santana, I keep mine. But then I was thinking I'm going to do something with it. Like I have every version of the IPAD. I'm like, well I'm just going to use this for my home security camera. Like, and it never, this ipad it's only gonna be for pre show music and then I leave it at a club and I used to try to do that too. But I felt like I used to bring an actual ipod. I was oil. I want to have an ipod is by itself. You don't just want to have my phone, but now that's ridiculous because you're, the new phones have 128 gigs. Yeah, come on. You're not going to use all that. If you do, you're an asshole. What's going on on your phone? Yeah. Movies on there.

Speaker 4:          00:03:00       Get the whole whole world plan on your phone. John headphone. So yeah, so it's been a year and somebody just tweeted to, uh, they asked him. Now I'm a little bit afraid because I haven't seen you in so long. And then you invited me to be on a podcast. People were worried on twitter that you were going to give me an intervention and that tells me I should quit comedy. I would never do guys. You're hilarious. Standup comedian. This is, trust me. I took that on my own. He's joking around about a conversation that we had with Brendan Shabazz. It was intense. It was intense. I still feel like shit feel like shit today. I felt like shit while we're doing it. There was um, Brendan last. He got beat up and stopped by this guy. Travis Browne is one of the best in the world. And you wanted to talk about it on the air.

Speaker 4:          00:03:50       You know, I wanted to talk about what we felt like on the earn and I asked him if he short. He was like, yeah, absolutely. I want, I want to get it out there, I want to get it out there. I want to hear exactly what you really think. And I mean, I'm sure what he thought I would think and what I did think was different, you know, and then as we were talking I kind of realized like I feel like his perceptions of where he's at and the dangers of what has happened to him and the reality of where he's at and the dangers of what have happened to them were off. And some people feel like I should have done that conversation off the air. And I feel like I probably agree with you. Um, you know, all, all things said and done.

Speaker 4:          00:04:31       The only good thing about having it on the air is that other fighters can hear this and they can, um, they can form a, I want to say educated opinion because I'm definitely not a doctor or a scientist or even smart. But I know a lot of information about chronic brain damage from seeing it, from talking to people who have it, from talking to doctors who are experts on it too. And to know that I don't see a lot of people that are at the front of the tunnel waving a light in mma saying, hey, you know, you guys got to slow the fuck down. We don't know what's up here. And I think that that's the case with a chronic brain damage. Nfl is just dealing with now these players from the seventies and eighties and the nineties and even the two thousands that are just fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:05:21       Now. Look in the Buckeye player that just committed suicide a couple weeks ago from looking at him, you know, look at. There's just a long list of players. I watched some guy get k Oh the other day. Oh my goodness. Somebody sent it to me on twitter. It was a vine of these two football parents colliding helmets. They just see that one. Jeremy, you're j. you're fucking football freak. Jamie. Probably. He'd probably want him. It's fantasy football. Street stakes. Yeah. Was I was reading from A. Somebody tweeted about it and then I went to. I don't even know what the website was. And then had tweet about like, why you were talking. And, and so I just read the tweets like somebody was paraphrasing what you were saying and without even really known the story, all I got out of it was you wanted him to just be careful with, with getting smacked in the head because that's not gonna work out.

Speaker 4:          00:06:16       Well, it's not that I wanted them to be careful. I'm one of them to consider ending it because I know he's going to end it. He wanted, it ended. He was talking before this fight about like when he's going to get out after the fight. He talked about two years. So they had a 42 year idea, you know, and the reality of getting head trauma is cumulative and that guys who get knocked out a few times, it becomes easier for them to get knocked out again. And the damage is all compounding. You're waiting. It's like buying a bunch of shit on credit and you're waiting for the bill to come and you've, you're driving around this nice car and you have this cool watch. But the reality is you owe a fuck load of money. You're going to have to work your dick off to pay that shit.

Speaker 4:          00:06:59       You're not thinking about that right now. Well, the chronic brain damage things, a debt that you can never pay, like you're putting damage on your brain. It doesn't manifest itself immediately. Always. It takes a while. A lot of these players were fine when they retired and then you've seen them like Jim Mcmahon, the sports illustrated article on, Oh dude, it's terrifying. When I was a kid, I didn't know shit about football, but I don't know who Jim Mcmahon was. He was goddamn legendary quarterback, you know him and the bears and that whole, you know the, the superbowl shuffle and no one knew who those guys were. He's Foxville now. You know, he, he will find himself in the middle of his house not knowing how he got there. He's just looking for his keys. Are Looking for what, what? He doesn't know where he was going to do.

Speaker 4:          00:07:42       He forgets things all the time. You know, I was talking to Brian Stan, we were text message and back and forth today and he was talking about people that he knows that got it from being soldiers from blasts and he's like, it's horrible. It's horrible. Like these guys, they, they can't remember anything. They have no energy. They're depressed all the time. It's not everybody and it's not. I mean there's. The thing about fighting is you never know when it's too late. It's like some guys can get knocked out once and go on from that to have great careers. Some guys can get knocked out a couple of times, but they're still in their bunny. They're just fighting beasts. Like perfect example. That is Michael Bisping gets knocked out by Dan Henderson, comes back, very successful, gets knocked out by Vito Belfort, comes back after that beats the shit out of Kung lean, one of the best fights of his career.

Speaker 4:          00:08:34       You know, like he's, he's been Kao to a couple of times, but it's only because he's fighting the elite of the elite at the top of the level and you know, he's just smudge it off. That's it. I mean, Michael Bisping is one of the best in the fucking world, but I felt like we shop. I was, I was seeing that it was going to happen more often and um, I, I fucking loved that dude. He is a great guy. I mean, Brendan Schaub, he's a really interesting character because he's this big, hulking dude, but he's a sweetheart. He's like the nicest guy. He jokes around about how he's like a, a dolphin and a shark outfit on the outside, but he's a dolphin on the inside. He's hilarious. He's really honest. He's like really honest about everything except like is fighting ability, I think is fighting ability or his position.

Speaker 4:          00:09:25       He's got a slightly elevated sense, but that's why he's a bad motherfucker. You have to have this sense that's almost distorted in order to be a fighter in the first place because when you first started out, how could you imagine ever getting to a championship level when you first started out and you're getting hit every time you move forward and getting taken down every time someone wants you to. It's, it's weird, you know, it takes a long time. So you have to have like almost this like crazed idea of yourself to be a fighter in the first place. It's just extreme confidence and you know he's got that for sure. And there's a lot of fighters to have that. It's great when you're winning, when you're winning that that extreme confidence is awesome because that extreme confidence like gives you like a boost over some other people who don't have that.

Speaker 4:          00:10:11       You might have like a psychological boost. Maybe it's in training, maybe it's in how confident you feel before the fight so you don't get as nervous as he does. There's all sorts of variables, but when you start losing, that's when that can be a motherfucker because that thing doesn't want to see the truth. That ego is a tricky motherfucker because it can help you and a lot of ways they can push you to success, but it can also fuck you up where you're not seeing yourself the way you should. You can't like you. You don't see yourself in a, in a negative way. You don't allow it in so you don't look at the flaws. You don't look at like. Especially true in martial arts, which is a hyper critical, you're, you have to be extremely self critical to be a competitive martial artists because the stakes are so high.

Speaker 4:          00:11:01       You're getting kicked in. The face is one of the worst steaks and all of sports. The possibility to this guide, I'll say his name because I fucked it up during the broadcast, we're seeing salmon at some on police is the correct pronunciation. He won this weekend with this fucking destruction of the head kick. He switched head kick the student the face and boom, the lights go out and the guy went stiff. It was one of those classic like worst case scenario, the worst thing that can happen to you in the octagon, and it was just a beautiful technique. They've just shuffled that front leg and Boehm Shin to the head, you know that is the stakes. So you have to be so fucking critical about your technique, about your conditioning, about your dedication, your psychological outlook on fighting, all those things you have. Keep those in a row.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       It's so fucking dangerous. If you don't, and when you start, if you lose and you know, you start looking at yourself in a delusional way, it can hamper your ability to work on all those areas they can hit like anytime you have a delusional perspective and introspective outlook, that's just not accurate. You're not doing yourself a favor like you need someone else to give you advice. You know what I'm saying? Like you not see you're selling, you're not seeing like things that you can correct and when you're in that state, as a martial artist it becomes very dangerous and it's, it's common to get to for fighters because being a fighter's extremely nerve wracking, you know, I am barely qualified to speak of it because I only did taekwondo tournaments and some kickboxing, but I just remember competing and being scared out of my fucking mind.

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       I was a kid, you know, it was 19 or 21 actually when I retired in between 18 and 21. We're all the really dangerous fights like national level fights. But you, you, you experienced these extreme fears and extreme highs and extreme lows. Like when you win, it's the greatest feeling in the world for these guys. Like you see guys that win like Johnny Hendrix, when he won the title drops down. He's just fucking. You see this rush of joy that goes through him that you and I are never going to experience. I've never experienced that in a taekwondo tournament because it was. It didn't mean as much. That's what these guys are doing is like this insane top of the mountain high. And so when you get to that top of the mountain high, the guys who have had those big wins, like Brendan's had some big wins.

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       He knocked out Mirko Cro cop who's like a legendary cancer. Mirko was legendary. I mean he's a. He was like one of the best kick boxers ever to enter into the glory days of pride. You know, when Mirko Mirko has like a head kick Kao highlight reel, that's like one of the greatest of all times. But if anything, the Mirko Cro, cop fight should prove my point to Brendan because if Mirko Cro cop and he fought back when Mirko Cro, cop one, the pride heavyweight Grand Prix, that would have been a completely fucking different fight. That was a different guy back then. It was just a different guy and everybody knows it. He fought Gonzaga in the UFC. He fought a 80 Sanchez first beat him and they fought Gonzaga and he got cro copped essentially. He got head kicked by Gonzaga, who's a very strong guy. Gonzaga's like, oh, he walks onto the stage like when they have to weigh in on Zaga sounds different than everybody else.

Speaker 4:          00:14:35       Sounds like it's made out of stone. Just a big, powerful fucking dude. Gonzaga is a beast. Gonzaga correct. One off the side of his head. And from then on, man, he just wasn't the same guy. I think those two fights, like in the UFC, he was never the same. His first two fights. He had some good fights in UFC. He was never the same as. He wasn't pride. You think a lot of fighters like stick it out longer than they should because there's no fallback. There's like, okay, I'm a fighter. I, I don't. I mean those guys have skills, but like I don't have any like me as a comic. If I ever decided I'm not going to be a comic, I have zero other skills. There's almost nothing that, that I know how to do. Yeah. I even said when I was trying to like make an analogy, I made a bad one.

Speaker 4:          00:15:21       I even said if I was a comedian, you know, and I was fucking terrible. I would want everybody to tell me that I should stop if there's something that happened to me and I wasn't funny anymore, but I'll still going onstage. I would want someone to come and tell me. That's a terrible analogy. Okay. I was just looking for something and after I said I was like, that's not good. Obviously being a comedian, it doesn't cause brain damage if you just suck at something, you know the difference between sucking at fighting and I shouldn't even use the term sucking. Being unsuccessful at fighting and being unsuccessful at like writing a book. If you write a book and it sucks, everybody goes through, your book sucks, but it doesn't, it doesn't give you a concussion, you know, and it doesn't give you concussions and training that you kind of try to ignore, you know, dudes land on your fucking head and training, you know, even in grappling guys collide, collide heads all the time and these are all, you know, these are all points against your brain.

Speaker 4:          00:16:18       Every one of them points against your brain. Every one of them points against your brain. Obviously comedy doesn't have that. If you think I suck, that's, I feel bad, but it doesn't hurt me. You know, he had been losing fights lately. Well, he had a real bad fight with her lawsky. It was like it was real clumsy and just look like both of them were just way out of sync and are all. Obviously it was super nervous because it was his first fight back in the UFC. And then our last, he subsequent performance, he fought big foot Silva and looked fucking great. Knocked him out in the first round and looked smooth, so like he got over his jitters for his second fight back because he had been out for eight years. Our last was the UFC heavyweight champ at one point. It's just Brendan looked super obvious like he was like telegraphing is shot.

Speaker 4:          00:17:05       I was worried about them and I'm also worried about him because he. Before that he got knocked out by Ben Rothwell and then he beat, what's his name? Lefarge Johnson, who's a beast of our Johnson's fucking scary. He's a vicious puncher. Beat Lavar by taking them down and just holding them down. That's basically how he won that fight and even kind of said like, Hey, I'm not standing with that fucking guy. Which is very intelligent of was a good win for them. Fought Matt Mitrione and condom and it darce choke and put them to sleep, which is a big one. That was huge. What I worry about is not those fights. What I worry about is a fights where we get hit with Ben Rothwell hit him. Ben Rothwell hit him with one left so I can just shut the lights out. His body dropped and Roth was on top of him dropping bombs know, and then he talked about it on the podcast.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       He was saying that he actually got hurt before that in training sparring with Shane Carwyn. Shane Carwood apparently heard I'm really bad with a punch. So you have to factor in. How many times did he sparely Shane car when my mind starts going, hmm, you're probably spawn with Shane Carwyn once a week. At least. Shane car one is a mother fucker. You want to talk about a dude who's built for war. I've met a lot of like freak athletes in the UFC. Like John Jones, a freak athlete. Daniel cormier has world class wrestler. I met a lot of freaks, but

Speaker 5:          00:18:27       you know,

Speaker 4:          00:18:29       if you, if you think about like elite level fighters and elite elite level athletes, you know, there's, there's so many of them that are so fucking good that it becomes, you know, it becomes a matter of whether or not you want to be the kind of guy who loses five or six fights in a row or whether or not you want to take those five or six fights back now.

Speaker 5:          00:18:57       You know what I mean? Yeah. I want to.

Speaker 3:          00:19:01       I just think it. I think it's, it's scary that you're concerned with a friend because you work in the business and it's interesting to see where this new information comes in, how danger it is, how you can sit there and even be friends with anybody but

Speaker 4:          00:19:19       without. It can be friends with a man because you can take a certain amount of punches. Just gotTa know when to get out. Your friends got to know to let you out. What I was saying about freaks, man, Shane Carwyn, St Darwin has fists that I'm not shitting you. They look like. See that Marshall amp over there? That's like Shane Carlin's fist. They're the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life. He had like four or five xl gloves, like it was always a big thing that brock lesnar had these giant fists until he fought Carwyn. Like Carlin actually had bigger fist and lesnar. I mean, you're talking about things that don't even make sense. It's like his. His body structure is so odd. He came into Jujitsu once. I was training at a mall Easton's place in Boulder, Colorado. It's the best Jujitsu in Colorado in a mall has this beautiful gym where everybody's rolling, we're in class and this guy walks in and I go, that's not even a fucking person.

Speaker 4:          00:20:13       Like, what is that? Right? This guys got like a gene, like a, like a pair of jeans on and a like a tee shirt. You probably, it's probably like a double xl, but he's built like a fucking superhero. Yeah. So then I realized it's Corwin. He don't realize how fucking big car when is until you see him out with regular people in a normal sort, almost like everybody else has just walking around their normal clothes and then this guy walks in and it doesn't even look like he's a fucking human. Yeah, I mean just go villa. And that guy was sparring with Brendan on a regular basis. He hits

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       he, he knocked Gabriel Gonzaga dead with a punch from like seven, eight inches away. Just just, just crank, boom. I mean, he was a destroyer and so shane was getting in sparring sessions on a regular basis with Brendan. So he's getting hit all the time. There's Shankar wins. Fists are on the right. And Brock Lesnar's are on the left. Yeah. What is that? He's a God damn gorilla. He's a goddamn shaved down white gorilla. He could hold that iphone plus that would have been a, he would have been a champion. You know, he had a few issues. One of them like back issues from um, all of his years of playing football. He had some serious like, like stingers and discs issues and stuff like that. Those guys are just colliding into each other, big giant dudes that size colliding into each other, but if he wasn't, if he just went straight to mma, wrestling and mma, I think that dude would have been a world champion.

Speaker 2:          00:21:46       He was athletic freak because she was so fucking strong, you know, it's just like he was one of those dudes like you couldn't let him hit you if he hit you. He fought Frank Mir and it was one of the most brutal beat downs I've ever seen in all my years because the way he did it, he muscled Frank Mir up against the cage, got him in like a collar tie or maybe a, maybe a tight overtook. I don't remember which one it was. And then he starts blasting them with left upper cut. It's just boom, boom, and you could see me or stock can't get out and can't take these shots. And he's just. He just sprinted at him, just sprint out on him with bombs and the mirror went down and they finished them off on the ground and that was a brutal, brutal knockout.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       So Brendan was sparring with that guy on a regular basis. So it's not as fight. I only got hit, I got hit maybe twice in my life where like I thought I was done with like stars in that weird buzzing sound that happens. One was a, I've told this story before, Danny bonaduce and then the other was a Stephan Bonner. This was years and years ago. We were sparring for some reason or he was sparring with Stephan Bonner. He was at. I don't remember the thing. We were at Krav Maga. He was there, I think it was training for a movie or something and some of the guys, the stunt guys were so anyway, so we, we started sparring and then he gets into the sparring. So I'm thinking oh he's probably just wants to know how to fight. So I've been kind of bounced around. Next thing I know I just heard ringing and whatever. He kicked me in the thigh that not like to try to like we were sparring so he wasn't trying to full blast, you know, whatever is 30 percent is is my 150 percent with the 40 year olds I box, you know what I mean? So it was nothing to do with him, but that was the first time in everything was ringing and I'm like Oh God, that was once. It's too many look and imagine

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       that over 12 years and just not just those like football injuries to. Brendan also played football I believe college and high school and you know, he was a, he was a fucking, he still is a really good athlete and that's why he's become a good fighter. But the difference between a good fighter, I mean he's a very good fighter, but the difference between that and the top of the heap guys, there's a leak, there's a leap, but there's a bridge that you have to cross. Could you cross that bridge physically? You never. I mean he's only 30 years old if he became like super dedicated and went to a very strict Moitai camp. And learned like really wicked, wicked, stand up and didn't fight for it. But how do you feed yourself when you're doing that? You know when you're a pro athlete. That would be really.

Speaker 4:          00:24:27       If he did that though, if he just stopped only training and competing for fights and I know he works on a skills as well, but if you just completely dedicated himself to the scariest part, which is the kickboxing, that's the scariest shit. That's the shit that everybody should. If you're, if you're, if you're coming into it with nothing, that's a shit you should almost concentrate on the most because it's the most dangerous. If you don't have it good defensively. Like if you get submitted, it's bad. You know you can break your arm for sure. You can get choked out, but they can fix your fucking arm. You get too many knees to the head from a guy like alister over him. You know you don't. You don't want that. You know the fighting is all about mitigating damage. It's all about inflicting as much as you can, but mitigating as much as you can.

Speaker 4:          00:25:08       And one of the best ways to mitigate damage is technical proficiency and that's something that people don't think about. They want to think about strength and conditioning. They want to think about running up hills. The most important thing is technical proficiency. It's the most important thing by far. And there's some guys that unfortunately for them, they come into striking late in life, like some guys come into striking and they have a background long background of wrestling and so they're. They're not used to jumping forward and throwing combinations and footwork and drills and it's alien to them. For whatever reason, their body doesn't adapt to it. You see a lot with white wrestlers. Sorry, white guys. But it's true. There's a lot of white wrestlers that for whatever reason, there's just slow with their punches. There's some guys that excel like it. Jake ellenberger, obviously Johnny Hendricks, obviously those guys started out as amateur wrestlers, but learned along the way to blast power punches.

Speaker 4:          00:26:04       But some guys never do. You know, there's guys like Ben Astron who I think is one of the best hundred 70 pounders in the world. He's a wicked wrestler. But his stand up is just really to close the gap. It's just to close the gap and then he gets in on you and you're fucked. He's just too good. He just. His wrestling is so much better than everybody else's. He just, when he gets in on you, it's Foxville, right? So his thing is all just about getting it on you, but, but the, but starting out with a deficit in strikings, the most dangerous because if you're one of those guys that doesn't have that fast twitch body, like a tyron woodley body or Hector Lombard body, but you started off as a Grandpa, but you can pick up the strike and really quickly if you don't have that kind

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       of body and you don't have that kind of coaching and you know, have that kind of training and the gym with her going over technique with you with a fine tooth comb. It's a fucking dangerous aspect of fighting. It's the most dangerous aspect is the one thing that you don't want to suck out. The one thing that you don't want to fail at is striking. And if you fail at wrestling and you didn't just get taken down, you know, it's not good, but it's a little bit better than getting fucking wheel kicked in the head. I was good at striking. My problem was, is I stopped striking about five inches away from your face, so that's not good.

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       So I could never figure out how to get. That was my thing. I, I'd always throw everything and you can literally just stick your face out and I wouldn't hit you because I would never. I was afraid to always take that, you know. Then I'm like, what am I doing? I'm doing this. Well, we talked about it before when you were sparring in class. I was like, how far? Like you gotta be careful. You told me that somebody had grabbed your foot, you threw a kick that grab your foot, held onto it and knocked you out. Yep. And I was like, come on man, you can't be doing that kind of spark. I used to bring my box, he stuff on the road and then I go to a bar, you know, a boxing. I get a trainer for the day, this is back when I was.

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       I would wake up, but I. I would go and do that and then sure enough they'd always say, do you feel like sparring? Keep in mind, this was 10 years ago when I'm like, yeah, let's. And then with defined out your comedian or whatever. Then they just want to kill you. It's a better story for them to knock you off. Then too lightly spar just so people get their sweat on you. Right? Yeah. That's hilarious. So, so I stopped doing that. Some people are rude with them and they don't think it's a big deal to Knoxville me the fuck out. So rude. It's like, you know, it's fucking. You could really damaged someone's head and I know that's the point of fighting and in a way it makes me a hypocrite. I'm fully aware of that because I do enjoy fighting. I love watching it.

Speaker 2:          00:28:44       I'm not going to not watch it. I just. I'm a big fan of brandon as a human being and Brendan Schaub is a guy with options. He could do other things. Brendan can. He'd go on and people from your pod, like I only know him from the podcast. I didn't really even know him as a fighter, you know, they got money when he's a guest here. He was always super entertaining to me. He is always funny, dude. Yeah, yeah. He's a funny dude and he's a. he's a really good dude and I think a lot of people don't understand him because of some of the hype surrounding some of his fights. He would talk a lot of trash, like he talked about trust in this fight and people get mad at him for that and they think he's that guy, you know, they'd get mad at them for maybe over assessing his possibilities being a champion, but he's a fucking great dude.

Speaker 2:          00:29:32       He really is. He could do anything. He, the dedication that led him to go from football to mma, he could go from MMA to having like a super podcast and career, which is a real option now. I mean, even better and better. Where's the fucking John Hef Rancho. You know what? I had one for like a second. You and repad a show for me and her ipad to show and then stopped doing it and then I stopped for a long time and then I started one called the state. I'm in a and I was like, I'm going to talk about what, where I'm at physically and mentally that'll be that way. I've seen, you know, so I don't have to figure out. That's a good idea. And then. So I had like Martha Quinn on and I, you know, I had. Did you interview her after she got out of jail?

Speaker 2:          00:30:14       Martha Quinn, the MTV Vj. Thinking of Martha Stewart. Martha. So it started off really, really good. And then I think it's been, I think I'm up until a month and a half and I haven't recorded one. So mark don't know how to do it by myself. Like how bill does this podcast with just him? That's his art that I don't know. His new special. So good. It's really funny man. It's so him. It's like the, in my opinion, the best one as far as capturing him doing like a regular set. He so loose up there. That's where like I, I know I have three specials and I'm going to get ready to shoot my fourth. I haven't done a special yet that I would go, yeah, that's how I am. If you come and see me alive. Who's the closest for me? This last one's the closest. And you did it in Denver at the downtown or the comedy works downtown?

Speaker 2:          00:31:05       Yeah, the little one. There was 250 seats and stuff. I've recorded two cds there. It's the best. It's the best. It's one of the. I mean there's no the best club in the country because there's a few clubs like that, like there's helium and Portland. You know, there's a, there's the element, helium and Philly, that's another one. The comedy works. Original Room. It's like one of the all time great rooms. There's a bunch of those. There's a bunch of foam. That fucking place in Utah is really good. Man. Wiseguys. Oh yeah. Oh my goodness. Utah Salt Lake City is filled with really fucking cool people. That was weird. Like I figured we're going to go to Salt Lake City. Everyone's gonna have their fucking pants pulled up to the rib cage is going to be very weird. They're all gonna, have the straight and we met a few of them.

Speaker 2:          00:31:49       Like when I got there I met some lady in the elevator and it was talking about it on stage because you could tell just by how friendly she was and she was a mormon, like shoes. Either that or she was looking for Dick and she wasn't looking for deck, so she was a mormon. She was like a mom and we got in the elevator with her and she was just like, hello, where are you from? How's everybody? How's, how are you today? Right. There's this weird like as far as Cultco, Mormons are some of the coolest motherfuckers. They're like, Jen, they don't fuck with people. They're gen generally. Pretty friendly though. It's like a really good call. Yeah. I've met her many, many moons ago. Met a stripper who was Mormon, was the whole thing. Oh my goodness. Like that's a mess. And then she got kicked out of being Mormon.

Speaker 2:          00:32:36       Know that club that I worked at this year that I've ever been to Lexington, Lexington, off-broadway, Lexington, Kentucky. I used to do the Improv there, right. So this place I believe it's like, it's off Broadway. It's in like a strip mall, but the club's been there forever and it's one of those ones when you go and you see the head shots, but they're from dudes from the eighties, you know, you see all that. And then so in the place list lung shitty. So in my brain I'm like, oh, okay. It's give me one of those weeks every show. It took me till show to, to figure out why the audiences were so bad ass. They don't serve food or nothing. So it was when. So you're taking out the element of people eating steak and mashed potatoes. It's terrible. It was terrible for comedy, which is still really fun.

Speaker 2:          00:33:27       I never would have thought like great shows. Nobody healthily or nothing. I know it's, it's nice for people because they can get like a dinner and a show in at the same time. It's good for them, but like for the show itself, the overall performance, like sometimes you're, you're looking down at the crowd and they were literally looking sideways, like everybody's looking sideways and they're eating meals and you're doing standups like you're doing stand up in a restaurant and this. That's fucking weird, man. You are dinner, whatever. This past week I'm doing my stuff and I'm like, why did I lose half the room? And then you see two waitstaff with pieces of cake, but they had like 20 pieces. So they're passing out cake to everybody at a birthday party or something. Yeah, like the guy. But if you're going to eat cake, you're not gonna pay attention.

Speaker 2:          00:34:10       Anytime cake runs around is usually when the focus goes onto the cake no matter no matter what. So it was Kinda. That's the one benefit of doing a theater because you're doing a theater. They have a bar in the very back. You had to go through the doors to get to the bar and no, there's no way. Checks, no checks, no waitress. Get your booze for the show. Show generally starts about 15 minutes late. Give everybody a chance to get back their seat, their drinks, and then just sit down. Yeah. You know there's. There's something about comedy clubs though that's better. The setup is better. The low ceiling and the irony is the only way to make that setup work is you've got to make money and liquor and the only way to make money with liquor is you got to have waitresses to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:49       Theater, you kind of. It's like they're just very different. It probably depends on what side you're on. Like I do four to five clubs a year. Let's say. I would love to just do some theaters. I would love to blow into a town. Be there one night, shoot the Wad, take off the next day just because you just read today, age or whatever. When you go home, I going to kill five days in Dayton, Ohio. Then the following week, Toledo, are you shitting on Dayton and Toledo last order that I would like. What? Do you know what? I know what you mean. Well, that's one of the reasons why you should always like if you can take a friend on the road with you to open for you a giant and it changes the whole game to take a friend with her. You're having a good time. You know you and him are just the shit and laughing.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       You can go to the movies. You can do all kinds of shit. Get to enter together. Side note, I mentioned kippah data because I'm obsessed with him. Why? He's obsessed with. Okay, I have to wait. I have to watch what I say because here's what I'm obsessed with. But he like, he's been. He goes after Internet trolls, I guess from what I'm, what I'm figuring out from other youtube videos he puts out, but he says people's names and phone numbers and he just goes and he does this whole thing going. You can come to my website and post something bad about me. Joe Rogan. Well I will tell you, don't use my name. You call them candies, but. But he has like, he has one video where he's talking about somebody pulls out a gun and he takes out all the bullets and then he kind of looks through the barrel wise talk. He's like, yeah, maybe scary. So that's why I'm obsessed with talking about that off the airflow hanging from a thread. Comedians, we tend to be fucked up. You think it happens when we get older? Like we're talking about like your instance, right? Like there's a lot of guys that just the older they get or is it just trauma somehow we get head trauma.

Speaker 2:          00:36:51       Well, I think as the older people get, you know, they're more likely to go crazy anyway. Yeah, right. So grandma and Grandpa weren't, they weren't the same as when they were ready to call it a, a life, you know, my grandfather before he died, it was, it was sad. It was just like he was barely there. You know, they uh, pupil people get real weird when they get old. Yeah. My, yeah, my grandma's 91 92. And you have to ask her the same questions. And then she started asking what my mom was doing. My mom passed away so I didn't like. Then I had to that conversation with her and then she got legitimately sad is if she just found out this information. I'm like, this, just this, this, uh, when they get Alzheimer's that's really spooky. Whether they really don't know where they are, they'll wake up like in the middle of doing things and not be sure where they are and they don't know people that they've known for years.

Speaker 2:          00:37:48       Getting old sucks the fat one dude, you know, luckily we'll be young forever to tie it into. What I was saying about Brendan is that all that shit is coming worse if you're dealing with head trauma, all the other shit that everybody else has to do with it was coming, you know, threefold. Hopefully not. Hopefully it gets out now. It'd be all right. There's a video of Terry Norris, somebody, uh, we were talking about on the podcast. Somebody put it up on the message board, I think it was or twitter, one of those. And I watched again Terry Norris when I was a kid. When I was like in my early twenties, Terry Martin Harris was the welterweight champion I believe, or 1:54, I forget which way, but God, Tammy was good woo. He had this

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       fucking lethal left hook man and. But he would get tagged a lot and fights. He would, he would fight guys and get hit. You get nailed. It happened a few times with him. He was a just a blood and guts super warrior boxer born with that, right? Like I don't know about that. I was talking to them. My point is that now he could barely talk. He can barely formed sentences. It's really hard to watch and you know, he was, he wasn't that old when you retired, you know, it wasn't like he was Bernard Hopkins fight and deep into his forties and then Bernard Hopkins because of his skills doesn't really get hit that much. So he's fine. He's 49 years old and he's fine.

Speaker 5:          00:39:19       Huh?

Speaker 4:          00:39:21       I don't like reading books lately, have just, I'm trying to get like that. I've read this book called on combat and it's just basically talks about when you're in a combat situation would like guns and stuff, like a lot of people get tunnel vision and then you get all and like how to work through that so you can not get paralyzed with fear, you know? Um, and I just do not have that thing like, you know what I mean when it comes from a lot of it comes from overcoming difficult things, you know, it's like the idea that you just get it and then you have it like a lot of guys that have it, like, especially like martial arts fighters who talked to them like they've gone through a decade of college wrestling and high school wrestling and tried out for the Olympic team and wrestling and they're used to like high pressure type situations and they're used to being super uncomfortable.

Speaker 4:          00:40:11       That's one of the big keys to success in athletics is you got to be willing to be super uncomfortable. You know, like you've got to get up and do training that you don't want to do. You've got to work out when you're sore. And especially in MMA, you know you're going to get hit while you're tired of getting hit. It's like there's a lot of factors going on. So these guys that can rise to the occasion, they've risen to the occasion a lot their whole life. You know what I mean? It's, it's a normal state for them. So for a guy like you who hasn't had any, you know, amateur mma fights are doing Jujitsu class against black belts on a regular basis, you're not experiencing like very difficult situation. So they, they tense you up, you know, they become alien. Like Jujitsu is a perfect example.

Speaker 4:          00:40:57       Like I've seen people go from being a type of people that were like super timid and like had self confidence issues and then they started doing Jujitsu and they'd got to purple belt and Brown belt level and now black belt level. And when you meet these guys, like I have a bunch of friends that are like, they're, they're not big guys at all. Like they're, they're very slight and very like you would never think that this guy's a fucking killer, but their technique is so good and they've become that guy over the course of like a few of them of course with me knowing them, they become this more confident person and it's just a matter of going through trials like getting,

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       getting beat down and then recovering, getting like getting dominated. Then you figure out a way to survive getting dominated and fit out, figure out a way to turn it around a little bit and then you slowly keep raising your level of ability both physically and mentally to deal with various scenarios and challenges that come up with different guys you spar with. I think even what we view as comics like that can happen because I got a, you know, my shows when I go to them, I usually people who maybe know who I am, you know, or they're my type of crowd, but even whenever I saw you guys a couple of days ago at the comedy store, I would show in my head like I went on stage in the first minute or two. I felt my voice having that crack, which, you know, I've done this for 20 my voice usually it doesn't get, but it's because I never performed there.

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       Uh, the, the crowd that was there necessarily didn't want to hear. So I'm 44. Here's some of the things I'm going through, you know what I mean? Because they were 20. So I had, I had a moment of that. Then afterwards when I was driving home, the show will end up going, but I'm like, yeah, I need to, I need to do that more. Like throw myself in scenarios that are just in. Just eat it. Yeah. You know? Yeah, absolutely. He needs to eat it so I can like. Yeah, it's good. Well that's one of the good things about a place like the comedy store or any kind of show where you're practicing. There's like eight guys on it and you can take some big chances with material. You can. You could. I mean that's like one of the best places to come up with a completely new bit.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       You have an idea in your car on the way over. You know what? Only one way to try. Fuck it. We'll just throw this out there and you know, you sandwich it in between one good bit and then you slip this new one in there and he'd throw some water on it. You see what you got? What Ms Dot last time if you like. When was the last time you ate? Like ate it mentally in your head. Maybe the audience like the audience sometimes doesn't know. You know what I mean? Right. They think, oh that was a great show in your head. You're like, I have those all the time. If I fuck up one bit, I'm super hard on myself. I had one last month I performed for Dale Earnhardt Jr. Oh right. And his race team. WhOa. And it was his birthday charity event. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       So 600 people. I get up there, dAle earnhardt sr introduces me get on stage for I know no shit. At least seven minutes, seven minutes of bulletproof stuff, stuff that's never, you know, it's been tried and it's not even like giggle laughs, right. Stared at me. I, I talked for for at least five minutes of zero laughs and sweat bust out on my forehead. And I'm like oh my, this is idle. And for some reason at minute six I did a joke and everybody started applauding and laughing and then for the rest of the show, you know, they were cool. How weird after like some of the people walk by and go, yeah, you were really funny and you started off kind of slow. Like that was the thing that's still in the guy who brought me this heffernan guy and no relation. He said that they had What I thought. Yeah, right. They sAid they had rape. Um, jeff foxworthy billing like other shows, like they just had to listen to you and not maybe understand how you talk for the first six minutes of playing and talking fast. Oh you talk like a foot.

Speaker 2:          00:44:58       But dude, I was sweating and I'm like I have not had this happen. And you know, I remember we went to, I think it was dallas, no, atlanta, it was atlanta, one of the first times I did the punchline down there and we did a radio station and they were asking us all these nascar questions and I was like, what? Like why would you think I would know anything about nascar? And then I realized, oh, everybody knows everything about nascar down there. And it's one of those things like when you find out about country music artists that no, never heard of, but they sold $50, million albums. there's a lot of those. TheRe's a lot that's a whole that south. So a whole different culture, man. Whole thing, whole different culture. It'S a complete different world like our world of, you know, you think like, you know, fill in the blank, you know, whatever band you like, queens of the stone age and you know, I heard the new iphones out there, fucking the new duck call came out.

Speaker 2:          00:45:46       They're all, it's so realistic. They're in their cars driving on the highway. I mean it's just, obviously I'm bullshitting, but there's parts of atlanta that are liked that parts of Georgia that are like that. Georgia is a fucking great country, a great state court, great country. Atlanta, Georgia is a great city, but george's george is an interesting place because I'm like a lot of guys you wouldn't think of or from Georgia like David Cross from Georgia, that greeley smart, sensitive, intelligent guy. He's from Georgia. You know, rem. Rem. Atlanta is a different kind of city man. That's where belieber a taped is a special. His netflix special. That's outright now. I please, please get this. If you're going to get a comedy special, go get this. Get mine too if you want, but get his. It's fucking great. I'm a big bill burger fan. I love that he's out there.

Speaker 2:          00:46:43       I love that. He's always writing new shit and then he's just silly and fun and you know, his act is, it's a silly, fun act. He does his bit. I don't want to give it away. I'm not going to say anything about the bit, but he does it bit about helicopters. Yeah, that's all I'm going to say. It's so great. It's so silly. Fun, man. I really, really enjoyed a set. I just love him. He's just a good dude. He's a licker genuine good dude. That's why I love performing with you guys a couple days ago cause you guys are all who you are. So then lIke seeing you guys perform is different than like when I'm on the road and there's some little feature that the local features, I'm not saying don't suck, but there's different conversations you have in the green room and the, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       the, the material is all kind of. So it's nice. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I went to a headliner camp for like, you know better. Okay. Then that's why I like doing those ice house shows. Man. The other day, the ice house we had ready for this chris delea, brian cowen, bill burr, tony hinchcliffe, ian eDwards in me, it was a motherfucker, a motherfucker lineup, but you guys wEre just murdering after murdering and for a few bucks to 15 bucks, what all of you cost individually on and your theaters are clubs for the most part. Everybody you mentioned iS, you know, a 20 dollaR plus ticket. It's a sampler pack. Yeah. But it's for 15 late shows actually cost me money because I take all the money that I get from those shows. I tip everybody out, all the comics and that he usually, either I make 100 bucks or um, our breakeven.

Speaker 4:          00:48:28       Yeah. I haven't always money every week. Yeah. But they're there. So the place, first of all, the ice house is a slice of heaven. It's just one of the greatest buildings in the free world. It's amazing. Their club is magic. It's like that club and the comedy store that. But the ice house has magic in a whole different way because it's pasadena. It's not hollywood. So it doesn't have. It's like full of itself vibes. So people like a little bit more chIll in pasedena. So oldest comedy club in the country, the owner couldn't be nicer. I mean bob fisher is one of the nicest fucking people that's ever breathed air. He's just so sweet. He's always liked that. He's got a great diy like always to everybody. You can walk up behind him. He doesn't know you're there and he's talking to the manager or the wait staff.

Speaker 4:          00:49:14       He's Always smiling. He's just a sweetie. Just a sweetheart of a guy. So like the staff there is awesome because of that, because of this like good vibe. Like all the waiters are so cool. Like every time I go there I'm like super happy to give everybody hugs. It's just, it's, it's a beautiful environment. And because of that, like doing shows, there is like, it's kind of special. There's something special about it. I'm there wednesday night. I love that fucking place. We do. I do wednesday night at 10:00, like every other week, every two weeks, every three minutes just to set it up, just to, just to fuck around there and have some fun. And also just to get people to keep going in that spot. That spot. It's awesome. It's been some 19, 60 something. What was the brand? It's been 53 years. I think it is something crazy like that. So 61 or something like that when it opened. I can't think of it. There's some really old school. Huge comedy albums recorded there too. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. I want to do my next special there. I'm committed. I'm committed to doing specials in comedy clubs. I'm committed to that. That's a different thing then. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do, just because I think I might pay for this special all on my own. Oh yeah, yeah. Film in a comedy club and just, you know, so that's just cheaper and it's just as

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       just as good as walking around a theater. Let me. Theaters are nice too. I think it's better. I think it's better just I'd have a better show because it's, it's what I normally do. Yeah. I performed in theaters all the time. Then I would probably want to shoot. Especially, although I have to say the burst special, he filmed at the tabernacle, which is the same place that I felt my last special, the one before this one and the tabernacle is a great spot for, for doing standup. It's not too big. I think it's only like, I want to say like 1300 or 1500. It's not like a massey hall, which is like 3,400 and you get to that size theater, like joey diaz and I went to see Louis Black once we were, we were playing the next night. We're playing on friday and he was playing at the same theater on thursday and we sat in the crowd and uh, it made me realize like there's certain shit that you can't hear the guy say because everybody's laughing like you gotta be really careful with like subtle shit.

Speaker 6:          00:51:24       You got to make sure, like you don't hear any laughter still when you're doing something subtle. So your timing kind of changes in those really big rooms. But the rush of the big room was like, yeah, I think that most I've ever done was I think 10,000 to some corporate event. It was, it wasn't. People showed up to see me. I was a sammy hagar was on and steve miller, I was on. Wow, you worked a sammy hagar and steve. but what does steve miller looked like? Did you even recognize him? A note because the album was only the white horse like, so by you know, teenage years I've listened to me. I've never saw what he looked like. He looked like a dad with a blazer and jeans and just went out there. That's the thing about steve miller. He is the least recognizable major.

Speaker 6:          00:52:10       He walk around rockstar. He could walk, run anywhere and it seemed like he never tried to become famous. Or you're going to out him on the podcast that steve miller. That's what it looks like now. Dude. He had some fucking jams. Jungle love. that was that whole album. Reminds me of high school. Take the money. And this is still about billy joe. We thought we. We thought we were cool too because we're listening to classic rock that was technically we're into this, not this new edition, you know, it's really fucking weird man. I went to high school in 1981 and in 1981 I started hanging out with these kids. I just moved into town into a newton upper falls and I started hanging out with my friend jimmy and jimmy and all of his friends were all from the other side of town. They, they're all like the north part of newton and they were all like everyone adores tee shirts and they were all smoking weed and it was like they introduced me to all this music that I didn't even know existed.

Speaker 6:          00:53:10       But when I think about it now, the shit was only 10 years old. Yeah. Like the allman brothers, they were, they were playing like some almond brothers are some doors. That shit is from like 1969, 1970. So at the time were talking. I went to high school in [inaudible] one. That was my freshman year. This is, what is it? Twelve, 13 years old. Fuck nothing. That's like some music from 2001 that's contemporary, you know, like a song from 2002 you could still hear like on a regular basis that would be on a radio station that was eighties, nineties and male sex and can day. Yeah. You can hear that. You could eaSily hear that someone can play that non. Ironically on a regular radio station they wouldn't be saying, oh you remember this shit. That would be a song they would play. But that sex and candy song came out In like like 99 or some shit.

Speaker 6:          00:54:00       Yeah. So think about that. Like that. We wouldn't say, yeah man, that was the classIc. Something fucking happened to time. Time is not what it used to be 10 years ago doesn't mean shit anymore. But 10 years ago back then meant a lot when I was in high school. And then in 1981 and 1970 car was a mother fucker. If you had a 1970 chevelle or a 1970 barracuda you what? A fucking sweet car. oh you got a classic muscle car. It's only 10 years old. What the fuck happened? And he does that when it happened. The acceleration, just information. We're pumped. We're going to the library every single second. We look at her phone, you know, that's what's happening, right? That is what's happening. I was talking, I talk about music onstage and I always ask people in there are, you know, people at the shows that are like 21 or all of their music has been digital their entire life.

Speaker 6:          00:54:59       Completely crazy. There's like never physically touched anything. Just that's not even a a process that they have in their head. I asked five people last night if they knew sissy space was and no one knew. That's insane. If you haven't seen the original carrie, you're doing yourself a massive disservice. That original carrie was a masterpiece. Is that brian depalma? Who made that? God damn, that was a good movie. That was like one of the best Stephen King adaptations and sissy spacey knocked it out of the fucking park with a light saber. Just. I mean, she was so crazy in that movie, like her character was. So it was. There was something about the ridiculousness of someone having telekinesis, but somehow or another she sold it like you bought it, you believe when she came out there with that fucking pig blood spoiler, she came out there and she had that pig, but they don't pick blood on her head.

Speaker 6:          00:55:54       They played a trick on her to get her to think that she won the uh, the prom. They all voted for it just so they could dump blood on her head and she just tore the city apart with her brain. And you're like, get out of here with this stupid fucking movie. Like, that premise has been tried before and everybody goes, get the fuck outta here. But in that movie it actually works. It's awesome. That's a great movie. Do you ever watch that show? It's now on netflix. Carrie santa maria is the one that turned me on to, I believe in black mirror. Black mirror.

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       Have you? Yes. Oh my god. Great. Just watch the first episode on netflix and you'll be hooked. It's like twilight zone mixed with technology. It's beautiful. In the first episode is one of my favorites. It's really good. I don't know why that is on in America. Yeah, it's on bbc America, right? Yeah. That's how I think I got it off of. I think I got it off a direct tv, like one of those instant plays. You can do that. It's on netflix. It's on netflix right now. Yeah. That's a good show. So amazing. Like mayor. Yeah, I think it might be right about technology making like years seemed quicker because we were watching an auction, you know, one of those, uh, those car auctions was on the tv show, the green room and uh, it was in 2002 camaro and they rolled out this 2002 camaro and everybody's like, who fucking cares that thing out of here?

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       nobody wanted it. They were looking at is 2002. It only has 17 miles. There's a reason for that. Do you know why would I get a 2002 camaro? What'd you can get? A 2014 and it's fucking dope. Or a 1969 and it's dope. It's weird because I also, I get jealous of new cars, not because their new cars now it's because of the gps is in their territory, their technology that's in it. Like I want that car. Terrific. I, I have a really nice expensive car but it's an old oh six. So the technology, I cAn't even plug my phone into it and well If you like the car, you know, you can always just get aftermarket stereo. Those are so much better anyway. And the nav system now they updated and now embed it so much that I'm looking at it right now to get the apple car play and my old ford edge, but they embed the sink in like sO I, I will lose so much if I get a factory or I'd take out the factory, like I'll get my oil change reports, my emergency gps thing that kicks in if I've been in an accident.

Speaker 2:          00:58:17       Oh all that's gone. Well that's annoying. And then the, the, so the, the, you can't update the navigation system on those cars either? Absolutely. Right. It reAlly pissed me off because with sync at least sync would update it within like the first year, like there'll be updates and there'd be sync is the word, but then they just gave up on it and then I was like, yeah, they just know they stopped giving any updates and so my shit's like doesn't even halfway work with my iphone anymore. Louisiana market. I have an aftermarket stereo in the porsche and I can download new maps and you can download updates. It'll tell me. it'll send me a signal and then I could just download it through the, through the wifi on my phone or the cellular connection on the phone. It's a pretty slick. Let's talk about all fast technology.

Speaker 2:          00:59:06       When you probably moved to los angeles, he had a thomas guide. Yup. Yeah. I'm surprised that they haven't really made a doc type thing where you just put in your like your ipad when you get into your car and it turns into like a car stereo and it hooks up immediate automatically. And bill burr had a fucking thomas guide as recently as 2008. They'll do the hardest. He fucking showed up at my house and I go, what is that? He had a map book on his front seat. He goes, yeah, I'm a fucking technology. I don't want it in my life. I don't need it. I don't. I don't need the gps. I don't need anybody. No one where I'm going. Did you hear him? But they know. They know that watching will. You know they're watching you. They know what your fucking car is.

Speaker 2:          00:59:50       Cool with that. You're cool with them knowing where your car is. That last podcast I asked if he was still using mapquest. He goes, no, I'd do it on the phone now. Finally gave up, but he's got a phone that's like for four years back. Just the character man. Thomas guys were were like, imagine telephone books with maps on each page, but then the find your street. Remember you had to go to the white and then you had to get a protractor and fun, but you would all. You do this all while you were driving by the way, not like members remember going on vacations or parents that they have like aaa triptiks where it's just like, all right, turn next page. Yeah, that's rIght. I remember now I did this college tour when I was 20. We had to go around the country and we had a game show.

Speaker 2:          01:00:33       It was called crack me up and you'd have to pull a student. You'd be a student and I'd have to see you in a chair and then I would have a minute to make you laugh. Oh, I've seen something like that. I can give you. If you didn't laugh, you got 25 bucks. If you laughed you got tee shirt. So I did maybe 200 dates of this tour just in a van with two other comics. I'm driving around the country, but we had a big rand mcnally map and then you'd highlight it and then you would drive and when you got 50 miles outside of the city you would go to a payphone and then called the school. Like it was such a. Like that was not that long ago, you know? I know that sounds archaic there. We got on the horse. Did you have a goto move for, for that show?

Speaker 2:          01:01:18       Oh my god. Dude, it's a. Yeah, I had a couple characters because we have props. How many seconds did you have to make them off? Uh, I don't remember. Thirty seconds or a minute. Seems like a lot. It could have been. I don't remember. Are you comfortable telling us what you did? You're comfortable revealing your secrets. Okay. Here's, here's the one that would get a. I would do this guy called book report guy. Okay. Okay. So I put on like a random funny hat and then I was. And then so we'd have like one of the comics would go now coming out and then you would say the character's name kid given a book report on a book he didn't read and I would just literally make up a book report and just she would just wing it. Yeah. And then they don't owe us. if people laughed, doctor quam here.

Speaker 2:          01:02:04       Here's character. now coming out dr. Karma. We had a japanese completely japanese head thing. You, you went japanese, japanese, just a. And I put on a doctor's thing and then I would move my lips and the comic behind the wall would talk. So it wasn't ever sink top. Wow. Did it work? You know. And, and where it was scary is we would do all these colleges in like if we thought it was a, like a predominantly black school, we knew we were dead in the water. Like a lot of times we go because we're like three white guys. one time, I'll never forget mccook Nebraska, we did a show, the basketball team comes and sits on the front row. Uh, one of the comics we're with, um, was mixed. It was half black, half white. He went out, he went after these guys just kind of, you know, trying to make fun of them.

Speaker 2:          01:02:57       Keep in mind, this was nineties, so like def jam was kind of in people's brain that that's how comedy was, was that type of. So he went after this a basketball team. So we do the show, we leave, we go to a local pool hall, uh, why were in their seven of the basketball team come to the pool hall and surrounded us and then they go to the other comic, jason. THey're like, don't ever say something in front of me again like that, but blah, blah, blah. I'm like, dude, these guys are going to fight. we're dead. we're, we're completely dead. So I remember I was racking, we were playing a nine ball. I was racking and then I grabbed the two. You were ready to go to war. There was, I thought we going to be killed. I thought we were going to. So I'm like, here we go.

Speaker 2:          01:03:44       So then, uh, they said, you better get out of town. You guys better leave or you're in a western, a western. So in, here's how I would handle myself in western. We ran back to the hotel as fast as we could through all of our clothes, just into one bag. Jumped in the car. But we're in mccook, Nebraska. It's all corn. So as we're driving, we returned in, you'd see headlights coming and you're like, okay, they're following us. this is where, this is where we get shot. Well they told you to leave. If they were going to do something new, they wouldn't have told you to leave there would say stay right here. That's true. And then they would have just killed. It was just beat your ass. The only reason why they would say you better get out of town as if they knew that you were driving a long way and they could overtake you along the way, push you into a ditch, and then their cousin who's the cop would stall on the way over there and avoid some of the evidence.

Speaker 2:          01:04:33       Who dodged the bullet? There was some statistics somebody put up about how many people get killed by cops and in what places like albuquerque, apparently albuquerque, New Mexico is just like one of the most violent places for like police and civilians. Like cops in albuquerque. They've killed a gang of people like the number. Like everyone is going crazy and berkeley. Have you guys been paying attention to this? They're stopping the highway like every night, like these kids are just blocking traffic on the highway and they're getting arrested in their live tweeting while they're getting arrested and part of me is like, well, look, at the very least they're making a big fucking deal, right? There's like a lot of eyes on this. They're stopping the highway every night.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       There's all these kids, they're wandering through the street signs. They're fucking active, they're active, they're making people think, and is it possible now? I'm not in favor of shutting down the highway because if you do shut down the highway, there's some people that might be on the way to the hospital. They might have some heart attack and you lose your grandpa because some kids thought it'd be cute to support that support the ferguson trial in the middle of the berkeley highway, but is it possible that just knowing that there's that much of a reaction, that people freak out that much over some shit that happened in Missouri that it might make them second guess where they pull the trigger? I say it probably does. Yeah, probably does. Right? All the shit that you're seeing on the news on a daily basis, every time something happens, people get in trouble every time.

Speaker 4:          01:06:05       Look at hollywood and highland. No, the other day I can't believe that guy got shot on right in the middle of every. You know, the center of hollywood in front of everybody and the only had a knife. What happened with that? What is the official story? Do you know? It's still being investigated because I've heard all sorts of ridiculous conspiracy theories involved in costumes and that he was one of those players that pretends to be cosplay. Yeah. Well there was a kid who was a cosplay kid who got shot with a samurai sword. Just see that. Yeah. Some kid had a fucking samurai sword and he was walking around pretending to be a samurai and the cops fucking starts shooting at him. Killed him, you know, and I don't think he threatened anybody. Do you think because it's aLl on the news now. Our cops like zero generation of cops that got really shitty training that like shoot people first or do you think it's always gone at the same numbers?

Speaker 4:          01:07:00       We have now, it just, we've reached an age and with news and now I think it's more that they felt was all consistent. Yeah, I think so. I think if anything, it's probably less now than ever because some places are starting to implement body cameras on the cops, which should be mandatory. It's a crazy role to role of having ultimate power over another civilian. You know, another another fellow citizen. That's a crazy role and that kind of power like the state. We've talked about this before, but if you haven't heard this, google the stanford prison experiment and it's all about how they had a these kids and these one, one group of kids would play security guards. The other group of kids would be the prisoners and they fucking went bad. Quick. People are gross like you can't. he can't give that people that kind of power like power, like to shoot and kill other people.

Speaker 4:          01:07:54       It's just people's default setting is, is pretty shitty, but we just have just enough. We changed the stuff a little. You also have to think that if you're dealing with a cop, okay, a cop is experiencing violence and murder and theft and robbery and crime on a rate that the average person will never know. You will never know wHat it's like to be someone who every single night is just going to war every single night. You're dealing with bodies and people that had been shot and people that have you fill, fill in the blank, everything. Rape and murder and child abuse and you're just constantly seeing horrible, horrible things. So when something happens, like a lot of these guys, they're so ptsd out there, they have just fucking trigger finger. They almost can't control their. They're experiencing like lifetimes of trauma in a year. I mean, yeah, if you're a cop and you're in a bad neighborhood, you're experiencing a lot of fucking shit and it affects people in different ways and I think it's just an unbelievably hard job to do. Yeah. Yeah. It's an unbelievably hard job to instill. THey get killed too, man. You know? That's another thing you have to take into consideration. I think 53 people, 50. How many comps a year get killed? I was reading the statistics. I don't want to. I want to botch it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:15       We just found, um, I, my grandpa, I guess I've never met him. He was a cop in detroit and was shot and we somehow came across the tIcket book that was in his pocket and there's a bullet hole going right through the parking ticket. The ticket book. Yeah. Jesus christ tent. Wow. Kind of a weird artifact to like locate though that 150 deaths per year. That's what it is. One hundred 50 cops per year get killed. How many of you know? Um, I don't know. That's a good question. Okay. 900,000 dollars. 900,000 sworn law enforcement operators, officers, whatever you call them. Well that's a lot. You know, 150 of them get killed in here a lot. A loT of fucking people. They kill a lot of fucking people. You're too. Okay. How many people did cops killed? What's guessed that? How many people are cops?

Speaker 4:          01:10:10       A lot of them. Bad guys. Let's just. We're not, this isn't a judgment thing. We're just trying to find the number. How many people do cops kill every year? I do want to get a 150 copies a year. A thoUsand 400. Seems like 400 per year. $400. I was going to say almost triple what? It was a couple of different sites that say it's 400 per year. So it seems like things low does it? Yeah. Well, I mean I guess half of them are still like, oh wait a minute. Hold on a second. It says local police involved in 400 killings per year. What the fuck? She's per city, Washington dc. Oh my god. Okay. Nearly two times a week in the United States. A white police officer killed a black person during a seven year period ending in 2012. Whoa.

Speaker 4:          01:11:04       That's fucking crazy. That's a crazy statistic. Two times a week for seven years, a white officer killed a black person. Like at what point in time do we have to say that there might be a little bit of a problem. What? What? How high do the numbers have to get with crime and police and police shootings and how high the numbers have to get before people go, what the fuck is going on here? Like how, how many black people are getting shot by white cops? How many black people are committing crimes? How many white cops are looking to shoot black people? Like what are the answers? Like if you were the people that were in charge of overseeing the police department, I don't know if they ask these questions but that will be like the first thing that I would want to address publicly if that fucking statistic. You know, people started talking about that more often. Twice a week, twice a week of white guys kill a black guy.

Speaker 4:          01:12:00       That's, that seems like a lot. I mean I don't want to laugh talking about that, but that seems like a ridiculous amount. Like that's a good argument. And anybody that says that like you know, that there's not at least the potential for racism. Like how could you not look at that? That number right there seems slow. I think Just in los angeles. Twice to two cops. Shoot a black guy. I don't know about that. Well, they were talking about killing 18 percent of the blacks killed during those seven years were under the age of 21 compared to 18 or eight point seven of the whites. Man, you know, and it's, it's a, it's a double problem. So this is the thing. Everybody wants to blame one side, but there's, it's a double problem. It's not simply a problem with the police officers killing the black kids.

Speaker 4:          01:12:49       It's definitely that, but it's also crime ridden neighborhoods, how to stop the momentum of crime ridden neighborhoods and kids that are coming out of those crime ridden neighborhoods that commit crimes. Okay. How do you stop that? It's not, I don't believe it's the children's fault. I don't think it's the fault of a 16 year old kid that grows up in an unbelievably harsh environment and it becomes a criminal. I don't think it's his fault. I think he's an unfortunate victim of a terrible situation. I think nationally we have to figure out what the fuck is causing that and if there's anything that they can do to mitigate that in some sort of way. It's just a waste of resources and life. You're, you're, you're asking people to grow up in an environment that's sold, likely going to fuck them up for live or you. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:13:34       Or you have to do whatever the environment asks or you're dead. That a survival. You're like, oh shit like that. You really feel like doing this, but you know, no doubt man. No doubt is not. And everybody goes, well, you go to choice. You should fuck off, man. If you live that guy's life, then maybe you could judge, but you really don't know. You don't know unless you live there. And I'm just guessing. I'm just totally guessing. No, you know, I just think the whole thing, ultimately it's a wakeup call for America. I think there's a lot of people that are pretty fucking tired

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       of the way things have been going in this country. You saw that video that, that boy, like the boy with the pellet gun. What did you know? My friend justin told me that that guy was fired from another police force and they picked him up because he had already gone through all this training and they picked him up and this forest, but they had already decided this guy might be like mentally unhung two seconds. So I think you see it. Brian saw it, but I don't pull it up. Jamie. I don't want to watch it, but I didn't want to watch. I didn't watch it. I didn't watch it. I just read it. That two seconds they start shooting them like as the car is moving still don't get it man, I don't get it. And then I read you read the comments and it's always like, well if you don't, if you don't want to be shot by the cops then then don't do stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:14:54       Like somebody was kind of like, like bagging and it'll keep it as a kid. I remember running around with guns cap guns and you know, playing war we go said let's play war. And of course it's 12. Of course, I definitely would have done it the exact same thing and if I was in that situation and I was black and I was doing the exact same thing, I might've got shot, they said he was scaring people and pointing the gun at him and he's probably a disturbed little kid growing up in a fucked up place, you know, it doesn't mean he has to get shot. We were like the last generation to actually have realistic army guns for sale at toys r us at a point like in the eighties we had guns that looked like real uzis rob banks with those. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No orange, orange thing.

Speaker 2:          01:15:39       I think that was like in the nineties or something. You can always cut that out. Yeah. Yeah. I know a dude with a drill for that fucker out. Make it look real. We had a game, uh, I lived in a subdivision, probably had like 40, 50 kids, deep different ages. We, I created this game called tag. It was from a movie town, the assassination game, and we had profiles. We had everyone in high school or whatever grade we were in your school pictures and then I'd write brian's home, here's what bassy road, here's his address, and then you'd pass out those profiles and then you'd have to kill the guy that whoever you got. And I remember the john dory come in my house, knocked on the door and my mind says somebody is there, open it. It's during he pulled out a gun, you know, like one of those ones that shot the suction cups under the plastic with the pulled up black gun pointed right in my head.

Speaker 2:          01:16:38       Shot me right in the face with it. My mom was standing right there. Didn't you know, it's just like a son just got ya. You know. But wall toy. Yeah. We're all walking around with guns, knocking on people's doors, pointing guns instead. You're doing it with all friends though. Like you knew the dude, right? Some of the guys, like if you got the profile, you didn't know him well and you just have to show up to him and shoot him. But they were all playing the game. You all looked at it. Yeah, it was all like mob hits and that sounds fun as long as someone's not genuinely mad, like you know, someone like maybe like to grow up. The other guy wound up where they are. The only rule we had was you couldn't shoot somebody on the way to school. Like that was our big thing just because.

Speaker 2:          01:17:18       And I even bought a, we had the spiderman things you put around your wrist and you could shoot the rubber things through the spiderman. I wore that to school just in case somebody wanted to get shitty with me. After school though. It was actual weapons that you would push, like where the spiderweb would come up and it would shoot the rubber bullets. I'm talking about those rubber suction cup guns. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would shoot one of those so I could point. So I had one shot. It was like a derringer. Why do you have that up? I was going to show you what he was talking about. They actually have to do a thing called street words where it's a whole city. Thirty days, 24 slash seven water gun. It's destination. Oh, that's hilarious. That's a great idea. That would be a fun thing. As long as you're doing it with cool people that aren't going to actually kill you.

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       I remember making the profile, so I would take your picture and then I would with stencil or whatever, you know, home office stuff we had, I would make a little profile and I remember my dad going at wish you'd spend more time on your homework then. Like I was obsessed with this game. Yeah. But your dad was incorrect because uh, you, you gravitated towards fun and now you're successful. Standup comedian dad was totally incorrect. Yeah. Parents are often incorrect, man. Got to get out of your fucking kids way sometimes. But then the other thing is I bet by like not encouraging you to do stand up comedy. Like you probably like, like by saying like you gotta get your shit together. Why you spent all this time playing the stupid fucking game. You should be doing your homework. But by, by doing that, like they put a little pressure on you and it makes sure that I'll show you.

Speaker 2:          01:18:49       Like some kids don't have that. Yeah, I'll show you because their parents were always super supportive, so if shit goes wrong they don't know what the fuck to do. My parents didn't know my. I did stand up for like five years. Really never even told them and then somebody saw me like at an open mic and asked my dad and then my dad goes and he was you doing standup comedy and it was weird. Like I was probably. My dad was probably whatever the math is my age now. So just like imagine like you then you're like, it's so you think your dad was an hip and cool and wouldn't want to be, but there is a major advantage to raising kids when you get older, you know you have your shit together at least a little bit better. Like when you're 20 or 21, like I couldn't imagine raising a kid at 2116.

Speaker 2:          01:19:39       That was a lot of people to do it. my life wasn't 16, 17. My wife was 19 when she had her. God damn man, that's crazy. It's just what an unbelievable responsibility when you're barely and she's in rome, nervous. She was in the military and having a kid. It's crazy. You're barely an adult. Barely. I mean as an 18 year old or an adult technically. Yeah, but we all know 18 year olds, they're like children. You know the children that know a little bit more than the average child. They're just experiencing life and they're still trying to figure. I mean, when I

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       was 18, I was a fucking moron. I was a moron last week. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was a moron a couple of hours ago. Know you're 18. god, you're fucking super duper moron, but are 18 was

Speaker 3:          01:20:21       way dumber than today's 18? Oh yeah. No, a million times. No doubt about that. We were dumber, heavier.

Speaker 6:          01:20:29       Fuck. it didn't have access to as much. They're super fucking experienced. The kids of today, they're super experienced in like not just like physical experiences but experiences like understanding like all sorts of different points of view and different information, different sides of things. Like they're mOre informed. They're just more on their brains are working at like a higher level. I really believed that. I've talked to some 20 year olds and I feel like I'm talking to like a young adult, whereas if when I was 20 and I would talk to other 20 year olds, I was talking to mo ron, other fellow morons who we would give each other advice and tell each other more ron facts that weren't real at all. You know, that was back then. I mean it's so nice to live like now if you have a random trivia question, are you like how many cops were shot? SomeBody you have access to that but, but like back in the day guys at bars, it would have to debate it. Like nobody knew that, you know, knew the answer to anythIng. You would just have to.

Speaker 3:          01:21:32       Yeah. It's really interestingly if you play video games nowadays because you're, you're matched up with kids all the time. So you're online talking to other adults and then you have thIs like 22 year old. That's an analytic guys I'm ready in its people are like havIng full on conversations with these kids. It's so weird. They don't seem like kids anymore.

Speaker 6:          01:21:51       Yeah, I gave up playing. Yeah. There's, um, there's just a new reality. Men is a new reality that we're experiencing. I had this guy on last, yes, less yesterday. he's a futurist and he just a, just kind of a guy who's invested in the idea of trans humanism and all this advancement of technology, but he was talking about how in 20 years we may not even talk to each other anymore. Everything might be done through like mind interfaces that work like the internet, like this, this device that they recently tested. They were able to transmit thoughts through the internet over like, you know, 500 miles or something crazy like that, like a very far distance. And you wear this thing and like you think, like, say if you think of hello, you think hello? Like you, you keep saying like hello, hello. And it reads what your brain is doing when it says hello.

Speaker 6:          01:22:44       And so then it recreates that. So the person on the other end on the internet has his helmet on and they hear in their head hello. And you're not saying anything like you're not using your mouth. You're using your fucking brain. Hey, you're sending a word through your brain to someone else's brain through the internet and it's really crude right now. Yeah. I wonder if there's auto correct for that. Like think something switches. Right? If someone's got like a deep like chicago aksana and that's what I meant. Shock each cac. What the fuck did you say? I was thinking that technology to even drive and I had a meeting today that was just like, I thought I wish I could just hollow grandma. Like at this point I'm eating right? Yeah, but that'll probably be in our lifetime. Don't like. I've seen technology biff of like cisco was doing.

Speaker 6:          01:23:39       Have you seen magic leap? Seen tupac? Have you seen magic? No. Magic leap is the new shit. It's this ridiculous technology there. There's a video that they show online where a guy's his hands out and there's a little baby elephant that is 100 percent realistic and it's dancing in his hand. So like some new hologram technology. It's just they're just releasing part of like this. It might. Who knows? It might, It might be a hoax. The whole thing might be like pumping up some fucking new movie that's coming out. I actually think that this photo that you know, or this video, I think this was just maDe to like, this is what it should be like, but I don't think it seems like they don't. They don't explain enough, but watch this because it's so bizarre. Dude. This guy has his hands out and as his hands are out, this elephant starts dancing around in his hands. Were going to pull up the video part of it. Yeah. We'll just show it to over here. It's really crazy to watch and there's another one where there's a little girl like, look At this. He opens his hands up and look at this elephant dancing around inside of his hands.

Speaker 6:          01:24:42       I mean, come on son. Fuck. is that the thing is making shadows. How's it making shAdows? Like what is that? Find that dude. Find out if that. Yeah, it was the seventies. We'd be at a bar and we debate it. Why don't you google jamie google whether or not that's real, because that sounds like no one knows some new technology, some new technology. All right, we'll figure it out motherfucker. Like five years from now we're going to be looking back at that and then it's going to be something sIlly that I remember. We thought that was a real, you know, what they're doing with this voice technology thing. If that really comes true and you really can communicate through words in each other's minds without talking and then there's no more spoken language and then there's like a universal language that everybody adopts. This is the idea that you're going to wear these fucking headset things and you're going to go into a virtual reality, so you'll have this headset thing on.

Speaker 6:          01:25:41       Then you'll have like an oculus rift on and you will like be in a meeting with these people and you know they can have avatars to represent who they are. Like you can go into this three d, virtual reality with this headset on and see people and you don't even realize they're fake until you try to touch them. I think it have couches set up. They could have a room set up where you could have like a three d meeting and everything looks exactly the same on both sides as far as the furniture so the person can come in, sit down, talk, hang out with you, and you literally will feel like you were in the room with them and you won't know you're not until you try to touch them. I'm just going to be like the matrix where everything just going to be gray and dingy, but in your virtual world is going to be beautiful.

Speaker 6:          01:26:23       That the life. Yeah, and then that seemed so silly. That's going to happen, right? Well, it will definitely have ruin the environment, right? If we ruin the environment and it seems like we're kind of on that path. I mean there's a lot of concern about the environment now and there's a lot of people that are making all these big efforts so generation is going to get good at saving the environment. Well actually that's not true because Norway has zero, zero garbage now. I believe it's Norway. They figured out how to completely recycle all their trash so they have like, I think it's Norway. Let me find out Norway and have to figure this out. Yeah. Right. Years ago, I think they use all of us. I believe it's Norway, Sweden, Sweden runs out of garbage. 90 nine percent. Sweden, Norway. I'm going to stockholm there in january for a 99 percent of sweden's garbage is now recycled.

Speaker 6:          01:27:19       That's fucking incredible. That's incredible. I mean that is like almost zero trash. One percent trash. It's amazing. I saw something on water. I think it was a documentary about los angeles or California running out of water and they had some plant that had sewage, like literally it was sewage water and an hour and a half later it was as clean as bottled water drinking. They have that drinking straw where you can just drink and it filters anything and they have like a guy, like a video of a guy drinking straight p out of it, filtering it. How dare he. Have you seen ian candidate? The moving? Yeah. Yeah. The new one or the original one? I think I've seen both. Yeah. That's an interesting movie about how they had implants put in and how they can control. Um, and yeah, I think I fell asleep during the new one for some reason I was probably tired when I was washing it, but the first one was pretty interesting.

Speaker 6:          01:28:19       The idea is pretty interesting. That's like an, an idea that always gets bandied about and conspiracy theory circles like they believe that someone could be in a manchurian candidate and like the guy who took out, martin luther king didn't even know what he was doing, you know, that kind of shit. Yeah. Jack ruby technology, a cool story. My brother in law was a hit, was blown up in Afghanistan. He blew off. So. So his quad got blown off, right? Yeah. so it is that you've topped muscle of your lake. Kind of dumb about this. Yeah. So the, the, the quad got blown up. So he's been in a wheelchair for four years so far. This is one that happened, rIght? Um, gained a bunch of weight and then the created this almost

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       iron man bionic leg that he can put around his leg. And then there's like a computer where your knee would be and it, it moves his legs, 100 percent paralyzed in this bionic leg, moves his leg for him. And then it also has a, uh, like a, a fall feature where it senses if he's going to fall, then it locks up so it acts like a kickstand. And then he was talking about that they're doing stuff like you were saying where you could have thoughts and eventually control it to say move forward or kick hard. Like you can start to give it more now, which is kind of like, you know, stabilizes them so we can stand up and he, you know, he walks with that. But I mean you got to like walk and hold his wife's hand for the first time in four years, like standing because he's a big dude. And that's the biggest thing is, is he just said hates being in a wheelchair, like going out because people, because he's always talking to people like looking. You used to be in a big. But the technology is pretty bad ass.

Speaker 6:          01:30:02       It's getting better all the time. We, uh, we talked about that on the show yesterday that there's now a soft exoskeleton suit. They used to be like, they had these big hard exoskeletons with like, you know, like metal pipes are rods down the sides of it and joints and hinges. The new ones are like way sleek. They almost look like, just like pants, you know, and there are those things that make you like live like strong way stronger. They make us stronger. You can, you can do things, you can go longer, you can go up hills. Like for soldiers, they're gonna enable soldiers to carry much larger packs and they're gonna be able to walk for much longer because it's going to barely take any effort. There'll be like 50 percent effort. Yeah, pretty crazy, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean there, there's just an endLess amount of super smart people out there that are constantly coming up with new inventions that we're just like every now and then one pops up on your google news feed and you're like, what the fuck?

Speaker 6:          01:30:56       Man? It's like, it's constant. It's every day, there's some new thing every day there's some new breakthrough, new technology, new discovery that now they're saying there was something that I tweeted today. They're saying there might. The big bang might have caused a parallel universe where time moves backwards. So we mIght have a mirror universe like this universe is going this way, right? There's another universe that's going on. Exactly. Taken his sat, hating it. No, the opposite. It's like the fucking earth has ended and it's slowly forming back to the big bang. oh, okay. So who knows what time it is in this other one? If it's backwards, I mean, who knows where we are in the life of the universe. We know that we're like 14 point 7 billion years, so if we're for or whatever the hell it is, if the universe is 14 billion years old that this other one is 14 billion years and the total opposite direction is right when we die, we get reborn in the new world and we never die maybe.

Speaker 6:          01:31:55       Right? Maybe qmap. I mean, we, we assume that this is how time goes, that you know, you do this aNd you do thAt and you move forward and you cloSe your laptop to get in your CAR and you say goodbye, but it's only because that's how we've always lived. Like the idea of everything going backwards is incomprehensible. But if everything can go forwards, why can't it go backwards? I meAn, who's to say that things can't go back to their source? Who's to say that like you can't like start off in some sort of a neutral position and have everything instantaneously be you when you're 90 and then slowly go benjamin button style back to zero again and crawling your mom's pussy. I mean, why not? If you can come out of a person's pussy, that's just as ridiculous as you going back in it and, and, and reentering the hive of the universe is just as bizarre to come out of a pussy than it is for you to become an old man. And then a child in, you have this other organism that you recognize as your mother that is going to take you into its body and it's going to absorb your soul, and then you pass into the next dimension. Then you're born on earth in our time. Start over and start all over again.

Speaker 6:          01:33:05       Would you be happy if you knew you were going to live your life as john heffron over and over and over again? Would you be willing to do this again? If you knew that life really is like some kind of a bizarre video game where you're going to play the same character ad nauseum to the end of the time until you get it right? Yeah. Right? Because so it is like a video game. If you don't make it past level one, then you go back and eventually I would love that. If there's a way you could talk to your future or your past self to let you know that what you want to know. I don't know. Sometimes I think that's what days you have a movement. Like if you haven't deja vu, it's because you've done this a billion times. No, no, I don't think they. I think they have a scientific explanation for vu. I forgot what it is. It's something about your eyes. It just. It's like a half secoNd. Taking the info. Are we guessing? It's a backfire against. Why are we guessing? Explanation idiots, because we're all had passed at 70. At a bar date. Your watch is going to go. That's not what it is.

Speaker 6:          01:34:13       How stuff works. What is deja vu? Here we go. The term dejA vu. It's french and it means literally already seen those who have experienced the feeling. Describe it as an overwhelming sense of familiarity. That's what we all feel. Right? Right. okay. Let's see what the reason is. The phenomenon is rather complex. There are many different theories. Okay, so no one really knows. Swiss scholar arthur hottest guys name ready for this swiss scholar, arthur funkhouser. That's his fucking name. Phone call. He's my new favorite person. Yeah, arthur funkhouser. Oh, that would be the greatest character in a movie ever. The funkhouser a classic rock dj arthur funkhouser was going to tell you about deja vu. how crazy is that? Get them on your podcast. He says, have that guy on. I know he will. He lives in Switzerland. Maybe I can. Yeah, we won them over there.

Speaker 6:          01:35:10       He asserts that in order to better study the phenomenon, the nuances between the experiences need to be noted. The examples mentioned above. funkhouser would describe the first. Oh, so there's a bunch of. Okay. They believe there are several different deja experiences. There's deja visit tei, which means already visited. There's deja vec who, ecu. I don't know if I'm saying it right, already experienced or lived through as much as 70 percent of the population reports. Having experienced some form of deja vu. A higher number of incidents occur and people 15 to 25 years of age. Huh? That's bizarre. It's been firmly associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. Reportedly, deja vu can occur just prior to a temporal lobe seizure, so it doesn't mean that it's exclusively connected to temporal lobe epilepsy, but that it's connected to to. I mean, for some people have temporal lobe epilepsy, they experienced age. I will not necessarily the other way. Just because you have deja vu, it doesn't mean. I think that's what they're saying. Well, what the fuck dude? So they don't really know. Not as romantic when people go. I just feel like we've been here before together. It's instead of night, go ahead. Kind of feels like a temporal lobe. I think our software is just bugged. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:36:34       I always associated with, um, with, with simulation theory, like, uh, the idea. First of all, just the idea that you could have dreams, you know, you can have dreams. Like I wrote about this dream. I'm an instagram because I was in vegas and I passed by this thing and they had this wall, this hotel, and they would write down famous quotes everyday on the wall and one of them said, if you can dream it, you can do it. Well, I went to sleep. I took four alpha brain that day kind. I went to sleep and I had this dream of a sex dream with mermaids. So I put it on my instagram. I had a dream that I could breathe underwater and I dove into the ocean and found a civilization of beautiful mermaids. They all sang gloria songs and surrounded me with loving hugs. One of them reached into my pants and start jerking me off under the day long continuous streams of beautiful flowers came out of my dick and filled the water around us, and then I wrote, so yeah, walt disney didn't know what the fuck you're talking about it.

Speaker 6:          01:37:35       It's like those dreams. That's a real dream. Just think about that dream like that was a very realistic, vivid dream, a dream like that. What is what's going on there? Okay. Obviously it's not really happening, but when you're having a really vivid dream that's completely ridiculous, like you're in a fucking avatar dragon. You're flying around while that's happening, you're, you're, you're essentially thinks, yeah. While you. While it's. I mean, it just shows you how slippery regular reality really is. If you can have these experiences that are totally ridiculous, but yet while they're happening, you buy them. You know you, you buy that. You and your friend really are running away from godzilla. God's oh really is coming and the whole city knows and you're running into people that you knew from high school and you're saying sorry, and you know dudes, you got in fights with your hugging them.

Speaker 6:          01:38:23       We're all Together on this now we're going to get the fuck away from godzilla. And then you hear and you hear that fucking thing coming over the hill. You, you're there, you're there. And then you wake up and you gotta pay, you know, like what the fuck is wrong with me? I really thought god godzilla's is real. I had my, I don't, I'm not stressed about anything but I had my reoccurring dream that I've had since I was like a little kid. It was basically somebody shows up at my window suddenly like a appear in the window like that and I start running from him. So I'll run up the stairs and then there'll be a ceiling panel and then I'll push it and then I'll pull myself up and then I'm in like an attic and then I'll run and there'll be another little door and I'll slide that.

Speaker 6:          01:39:04       So I'm consTantly running from somebody who's below, but I have all these secret passages. Then I was watching the discovery channel and they had a thing about ninjas. This ninja house. This guy got out, he would move a sliding panel and he went through and I go, that's it. That's why I enjoy fighting. That's why I'm having this dream. I was in ninja. Not kidding you. The thing they showed in thing was the exact dream that I've had. I think that that happens in almost every ninja movie. I know you've seen ninja movies. that is a much better explanation than you used to be. A japanese dude back in the days where there really were ninjas. That seems like a bunch of generations ago, man. What happened last life? You know? How come you remember that shit was probably what? The forties. It was kind of boring.

Speaker 6:          01:39:53       I think they have a photo. There's a photo that was just going around recently. Brian, see if you can pull this up. It's the last known photo of a samurai and actual samurai before they somehow or another, the culture was abolished. I don't know how they did that. I mean they made it illegal to walk around with swords or I don't know what they did, but this is a. I think photographS were discovered or were figured out in the late 18 hundreds, I believe. Right? was that right? Does that make sense? So this guy existed with swords. You know, I'm walking around with a sword in the 18 hundreds. I'm pretty sure this is the google episode john had put them on. I'm wondering, you're dumber guests so I can't drop a lot of those. So not true. That's not the photo that I saw, but it might be another one that's similar.

Speaker 6:          01:40:40       This last known photo of a samurai. See if you google that will look at that. Dude, that's what I googled. You ever see those ninja classes like that ain't the one I saw, but it's still pretty dope in martial arts, like magazines or even online. There's like guys that teach you how to be a ninja. They teach you how to send you a ninja black belt and then you have to promise you're going to watch the videos. I'm serious. I saw like a native american martial art, it was like indian martial art, but that's what the guy did. Oh yeah. He sent you a black belt and then just through the honor system in to watch the dvds. That's so. Well that's just people trying to make money. That's the one thing about martial arts is a. You can. You can definitely learn some things from a dvd as long as you get one on one instruction as well.

Speaker 6:          01:41:29       Like the originally get one on one instruction like it. It's way quicker path. If you have someone showing you where to put your weight, especially jujitsu, right. It's hard to see what's going on. like if you're watching the guys strike like you're seeing things in real life like you're seeing. Whereas his chin is his placement. It seems like there's less variables, but when you're seeing jujitsu like you don't know understand like where he's his holding his balance and and how he, how he passes the garden a certain way. There's so many different things that go along with like setting up a submission has all these steps along the way that are super critical because you've got to know the defense of those steps and you got to know the counter to that defense and you've got to have two different paths out of there. You can't just have one.

Speaker 6:          01:42:10       So like while you're teaching someone like a jujitsu, like a setup for a submission, you're also teaching them the defense of that submission and you're also teaching them like usually you're teaching them what the counter is, you know, especially if they're like bluebell, bluebell, leverage, something like that. So there's just so many lIke to teach that with a dvd, it's so hard to do. You can kind of teach basics like real simple stuff and if you paid really close attention, you can kind of learn that, but way harder. it's way better to have somebody move you like show you like here, like not turn it like there and you're like, ooh. Because it was like some like subtle variations just in the way you hold a choke, right? Because this guy who one in Brazil, one of the last, uh, cars that we did. No, no, no.

Speaker 6:          01:42:52       Mexico city. He caught this dude in a good team and he did this new thing that a lot of guys are doing called the pretzel grip. And like, if someone doesn't show you how to do that grip, it seems. It seems real weird. Cavan mimic you doing that. Yeah. My friend was watching you on video. My friend denny showed it to me, but it seems goofy as hell, but when you actually do it, it really works. It's awesome. It's like this crazy new grip that guys are doing. That's one of those things like someone's gotta like put your hands there. You got to show it to you. You got it done to you. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Getting it done to you is another big one. I've always been kind of like a workout equipment or video whore. I'm not so much lately, but I would buy a lot of stuff. And uh, this was years ago, I actually bought a, it was a russian martial arts video of how to fight and water. I'm not kidding. Whoa. Yeah. Oh, you told me about this. we actually talked about it on the podcast, I believe way back in the day. oh, good. Mike, I know you've told me this story though, how to fight in a shallow pool and then like

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       there's different techniques. If you're treading water, look at this. This is a photo of a japanese dude about to commit a ritual suicide. Are that wonderfest real? I want to pretend it's real, so I don't want to even research it. Find out if it's not real, but this is all these different photos from samurais 19th century. So the 18 sixties, the photos were taken in the late 18 sixties. Literally those guys. Well, they weren't very tall. You know what I mean? Japanese folks back then. Especially. Is that guy doing it to himself or is that a movie? It looks like a movie, but supposedly through. Oh boy, this chick was the same. Right? That's pretty hot. I bet they did take photos. Oh, that chick samurais damn powerful chick, samara. I bet they did take photos of them killing themselves. Oh dude, this one though. This guy's bleeding and this one, look at this. This guy's fucking bleeding, man. He's actually doing it. She's, oh, two data is dark.

Speaker 4:          01:45:00       So there's a photo of them sitting around while this guy actually kills himself and the blood's coming out of his, uh, the top of his kimono and down into it's like leaking down into his crotch area. You see it and I'm still looking for it. There's a lot of photos. Yeah. Go to the daily mail article. Just it says, end of the samurai stunning portraits of japan's warrior class just ended the samurai daily mail have ever taken a martial arts weapons training stuff. No, I think we burned like on paper. It's not like. It seems like it'd be cool like David Lee roth does the samurai swords. Yeah, that will be awesome. And then you scroll down, scroll down to one there, right there. That guy's killing himself. We're hugging and they're all sitting around just chilling. It doesn't seem real. Teenagers might not be posed like it's like, look at us, we're, but it might be real.

Speaker 4:          01:45:52       You know what I mean? When you're dealing with someone that's going to do a ritual suicide, like the kind of willpower and then they had to be as gangster as possible when that guy is stabbing himself in the stomach and cutting his guts open with a sword, it's probably. That can be a real picture because it's probably colorized whoever, colored eggs, like, you know what? Add this little. Yeah. Well I think that the whole photos got to be colorized, but they didn't have photos back then. So this is all colorized. The, uh, the photos that are black and white. I kind of prefer a test. I don't want to. A shirley temple fakeness. Yeah. I don't want to see that, that fake color. I'd rather see a black and white and know that that's what it looked like to the person that was holding that camera, that made that photograph and then developed it. It's really amazing when you think about the fact that everything past like the 18 hundreds, whenever it was, when they invented

Speaker 6:          01:46:50       cameras, everything past that is accelerated. Like our visual understanding of the world is accelerated in a, in a way that we don't really think about that much. Like no one knew what the fuck africa looked like back then. Like if you were, if you were living in Wyoming in 18, 20, you have no idea what africa looked like. You had no idea. No it United States look like somebody tried to tell you. Somebody trying to tell you about the animals that were over in africa. They might as well be talking about like people that live on the moon, what? There's black people and there's other plane and elephant. Yeah. You know, they didn't even know gorillas were real until the beginning of the 19th or the 20th century. The 19 hundreds.

Speaker 6:          01:47:32       No, they didn't go marry. Well, they were in the jungle and then like one or two dudes that african people knew they were real. But I mean when we, I mean us goofy white people to black people. We didn't know him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The discovery of the gorilla. I'm pretty sure it was the early 19 hundreds. Hold on a second. This is the google show gorilla. Great babe. Okay. Discovery of the gorilla. Uh, they had to have known before. Right? Because has no to discovered in 19. Oh, two nuts discovered on October 7th, 19. Oh, two on the ridges of the volcanic. I don't know how to say this. Virunga mountains by german explorer. Captain Robert Vaughn, burying b e r I n g dot the mountain gorilla was named gorilla gorilla. Been in gay. In honor of the captain. Yeah. How fucking crazy is that?

Speaker 6:          01:48:39       So weird. Yeah. That was a conversation at work, like the day after that were people are like, hey, did you see that there's a thing like us has hair all over it? Well, how about those dudes? Those explorer dudes from the early 19 hundreds, you know, that would show up and you know, they have like fucking their wives would be with them and they tried to like make camps in the Congo, you know, like that was, that was the subject of so many movies. Like that was the subject of king kong. Remember this is an explorer. They brought the actress and they showed up with his island like and these like the ghost in the darkness. I remember that. Yeah, like the white people and all the black people working for them. They're making a railroad and africa crazy. Yeah. This is a. They have his, uh, this is pretty cool, man.

Speaker 6:          01:49:26       They have is actual account of like, of, of meeting a girl for the first time from our campsite, we were able to watch a herd of big black monkeys which tried to climb the crest of the volcano. We succeeded in killing two of these animals and with a rumbling noise, they tumbled into a ravine which had its opening and a north easterly direction. After five hours of strenuous work, we succeeded in retrieving one of these animals using a rope. It was a big human like male monkey of one and a half meters in height and a weight of over 200 pounds. His chest had no hair and his hands and feet were of enormous size. Unfortunately, I was unable to determine its type because of its size. It could not very well be a chimpanzee or a gorilla. So they did know some gorillas. In any case, the presence of gorilla had not been established in the area around the lakes, so they didn't know what it was. This is so confusing. Look at the photo brion pull. Pull that up because it's a crazy picture of this. These people standing over this dead gorilla. This is one of the first gorilla. So that's a mountain gorilla. So, but he said gorilla. So that's kinda weird. So what does that mean? Like when did they discover the actual gorilla? So there's other kinds of gorillas other than mountain gorillas. Then that's the only thing that makes sense to me, right? A physical characteristics, discovery, communications, intelligence tool use interaction with humans. Here we go.

Speaker 6:          01:50:57       Okay. Five hundred bc and implore explorer on an expedition in the west african coast encountered a savage people, the greater part of whom were women whose bodies were harry and who are interpreters, called gorilla. The word was then later used as a species name. And although it's unknown whether these ancient carthy gains encountered were truly gorillas, another species of apes or monkeys or even humans. Wow. Okay. So that was the first account of gorillas. It's written down. That was 500 years before christ. So the first westerner to see a live gorilla was in 1856. He brought dead specimens to the uk in 18, 61.

Speaker 6:          01:51:44       The first systematic study was not conducted until the 19 twenties. So yeah, I mean they kind of knew about gorillas back then that it seems like it wasn't. Look at that thing. Isn't that weird? Fake god, that face looks fake. Yeah. But they couldn't do fake back then to fake that. They had actually looks pretty real dude, if you will look at that face that face, like get close up on it. Like that thing that's a dead monkey. But those mountain gorillas, they have those chest plates, you know, plus you gotta, you gotta realize that's like the worst cell phone picture ever know. That's what like the best pictures were back then. The best pictures. I mean this is 18, what? It was at 18, 60. What? Yeah, the dude had to set up that thing that they didn't have flashback. Now he's in 19, 19.

Speaker 6:          01:52:27       Oh, two nine. Oh, that's the 19. Oh, two picture. Fuck man. Yeah, so that's the mountain gorilla. So I guess like they had some different species of gorillas, but it wasn't really until the 1800 that us white people started figuring out that they were even real. I think the first thing he does when he sees him as he tries to kill him, I know felt like the first like, oh, what's this? I kill it. Don't you think that's what happened? If, if aliens landed here, I do think we shoot first. They'll be like, hey, that's just what they. Are there certain people that would definitely shoot for. Yeah, there's, there's people out there, man. Like it goes back to what we're saying about cops. Like there's some cops, they're just getting out of the car shooting right there. They're looking to shoot. Right. And I think there's probably like some human beings that have aliens showed up, would do the same thing.

Speaker 6:          01:53:14       They would see the alien and they just start shooting. They wouldn't even think about if they had a gun on them and they were worried about their life off the alien. Went like put, put his hand out, you know, you, you'd weird out if it was trying to communicate with you, like the, you would have to be so vulnerable to like allow an alien close enough to you to communicate with it. You'd have to assume that it's not going to eat you. Like, how would you know? Like, could you imagine how stupid you would feel if you came up to an alien? You're like, hello friend. And it's like throws a net on your cinches it uptight, holds you up and take some selfies. Yeah. Fucking throws you in the back of its spaceship. And you'd be like, fuck, I should have shot him. You know? So who knows, if they're like us, maybe we should fucking shoot them.

Speaker 6:          01:53:59       They're. Or maybe that brain thing where you can. Your thoughts. Good thing. Maybe that's the piece of eQuipment we need to actually talk to them. Did you see a europa report is pretty interesting. Uh, it's um, it's a movie about these people. It was a scifi movie about theSe people that go to europa. Europa is one of jupiter's moons And it apparently has water on it. I think it's jupiter's moon, right? So julie's mom. apparently it's frozen solid. It's a ball of ice. And under the surface there's cracks on the surface. It indicate there's some sort of flowing water underneath. And so they, they're trying to, in this movie, they go there. I don't want to spoiler alert for anybody but they go there and have encounters. But the way, uh, it, like, you think about like someone coming from another planet and landing on your fucking planet, you're going to automatically assume they're hostile is fuck yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:54:57       Like you're going to automatically. Yeah, yeah. Aliens are dead. They're dead or were dead. That word that one of the other figure there knows, maybe they dIdn't. Maybe they have really low testosterone. Maybe they breed. How about this? What if aliens evolve to breed with no sex? So there's no competition for breeding and the competition is all about surviving against their elements and the predators and their area. So they don't have, they don't have like this, this male conquer thing like we do. they're all androgynous. That's why they don't have decks. They don't have a giant, they don't have big titties. No aliens don't have beauty videos. There's no twerking in the alien world. They don't care about sex. It doesn't mean anything. The number one thing to us is sex. It's like we need. We have this crazy desire to procreate. We have this crazy desire to be with other people of the opposite or in some cases the same sex.

Speaker 6:          01:55:49       It's a big factor for why people become successful. It's a big factor for why people sell items that use beautiful women to sell things and dudes with fucking six packs of cell genes and jimmy dean sausage isn't shit. You know, that's just a reality of being a human being. So it's really hard for us to separate that idea from living organisms. But like there's a lot of organisms that don't have sex at all. You know, there's plants and some, some fucking slugs and shit. I guess they fucked, but there they are, the male and the female. The male could fuck them. They, they're both like, I think a slug is like one of those things is by its bisexual in a weird way, not like you're in the chicks, but the way you have both sexes. They're hermaphrodites. I got it. Yeah, and I mean we could have.

Speaker 6:          01:56:37       that could easily be the case with some being from another planet and if that's the case, they might not understand aggression. They might not understand how locked out we are and then they just show up. You know, like if the aliens land and they show up very hippyish were just, they might not understand violence. They might have somehow another grown up in this goldilocks zone that's like way better than our goldilocks zone where there's no predators. Everyone eats plants. All procreation is all procreation is done through like this mutual experience of the entire tribe gets together and has, has babies together and that there's no sex involved and it's all just community, friendship and love. And then a child is born out of that love. That's just as look. How weird is it? You shoot a load in someone's pussy and that's what makes a person that's fucking ridiculous.

Speaker 6:          01:57:27       IT's so ridiculous. It's not just as ridiculous to think of a community of evolved beings and all get together and hug, you know, and then out of that hug, a tiny child appears and they all care for it together. That's just as possible. And then they get lost, show up on earth and we waste them within 15 minutes. Crazy. Craziest pollen. how crazy is the fact that plants need bees to take pollen and pollinate their fucking plants? You know, polly take flowers and distribute like literally genetic material from those plants distributed all around. If that's a part of the whole ecosystem. You have these bees that are responsible for these plants growing and if these bees die off, everybody's freaking out. Like what kind of lose the bees were gonna lose society. People are going to starve. Like what? Hold on. we got workers. We got these little worker bees that they work for us.

Speaker 6:          01:58:15       We don't even know about It. Like we need them to feel like they're. They're important for almonds. Like what would be the other day, I didn't feel mother fucker, you terrible person, terrible person, but think about that. That's an actual reality of nature is that bees pollinate plants. It's a reality of nature. It's so bizarre, but it's responsible for like the progression of plant life. That's like a big part of how it goes down. Like I think there could be an infinite number of different styles of life out there in the universe. And that's one of the things is europa report thing was about, wasn't the best movie, but it held my attention. It was interesting and it was about like an alternative type of life that could exist on a predictive aliens land. It probably began to be skinny. I would think they would be so slick that they would be right here. Right now. We'd have no idea.

Speaker 6:          01:59:09       I think they're hiding in the asians. There's so many asians in China and stuff, a lot of places to hide. Well, that's because they had a landmass over there. I think, um, that was one of my more stupid theories when I was into the idea that human beings are genetically engineered from aliens. They took people and they added alien dna to people and that's why we're so different from all the other monkeys that exists. All the other apes. My big thing was that like they had like different, different levels. Like they'll put like a little less alien, some people and there'd be like a little less, a little hairier like doing it. A lot of back hair with the. Yeah. You ever go to the beach and see some. Some fucking dudes are just. Harry is iranian dude. Get everyday the fucking iron sheik or see an asian guy.

Speaker 6:          01:59:54       No hair at all. You know, the different, complete different features. Smart, very, very little body hair. Notoriously good at mathematics. That was my stupid theory that they were more alien. So dumb. I, I'm, I'm forward. So you know who's for it? Dennis mckenna. Really? Dennis mckenna thinks it's very possible that some sort of other advanced life form has visited earth in the past and subtly or actively re-engineered or engineered human beings that they had some hand. He said it's possible and he bases that on like a bunch of things like what we would do if we could do it like if and and the idea that we're a fairly young planet lIke earth is only like four and a half billion years old. So the universe was around for 10 billion years before earth was or somewhere abouts roughly. That's a long time. If something just had a 100,000 year headstart, that's it.

Speaker 6:          02:00:52       That's all it needs. 100,000 year head start from where we are now without blowing yourself up. Could you even imagine what kind of freaky shit we're going to be able to do and 100,000 years is a blink of an eye. So if we could show up, see if the Congo was a planet instead of like the Congo with these guys show up and they start lighting these gorillas up. What if there was a planet and we found this planet and it was all apes. There was no people and we did like an accurate survey. The planet like tom cruise style, we land in this fucking little white outfits. We've taken like biological for a guy in a hot chick, hot chick, right? And uh, that he tries to keep me, saved her life. She gets an injury. I mean, that's just a scout parties. You've got to do your own scale party.

Speaker 6:          02:01:35       Yeah. You know, maybe like you guys scale part of it likes to tAke naps and he saw something but you didn't, you file for sure. False reports, travel. And then there'll be like, there'll be like a protagonist who's, who's the, they would have to be a woman that's like a powerful woman, like sort of balances it out. Will you guys get that job done? You're down on planet Congo, get the job done and get back up here. And maybe there's like cylons moving in and we got to get back to the planet and fucking. But point being, if we landed on planet Congo and there was only monkeys, if we thought that they were just like the chimpanzees here, for sure, we'd steal a few. RiGht? Fuck yeah. Are you kidding me? If they knew that they could land on a planet, say if they found a planet, you know, whatever, a light year away, you know, they figured out how to get somewhere in a year and on that plan that they knew there was live primates that were exactly like chimps.

Speaker 6:          02:02:31       they're like, oh, this is what it is, man. These animals, if you Give them enough time at this temperature, this is what you get. if the temperature's higher, you get dinosaurs. If the temperature is lower, you get woolly mammoths and you know what I mean? Like what if it's like a universal thing in, in, in the cosmos said, all you need is water and carbon and all the building blocks and the same life forms exist everywhere. If we find that out and we show up someplace and we find monkeys were stealing them. Yeah, for sure. And we find that we go there, there's parrots and anaconda is what this is exactly like the rain forest, and they're like, exactly, exactly. But pretty sure we'll fucking steal one of those monkeys. Let's find out. So there's the monkeys are the little monkey community and monkey school system and teaching each other what sounds for anaconda.

Speaker 6:          02:03:15       What's the sound for, for eagle that comes to steal you from the trees. They try to teach and we just go along and go, oh, you're not smart enough for us to care about your community. And so getting the cage hooker clink, shut that fucking box. Push it into our space. But. And for the rest of their lives, those chimps have to freak out. Thinking about the time that this thing came, this metal disk and stole their mommy. Go. Yeah. Some people wouldn't believe him. We would do it. Don't you think of it in a second, but in a. Do you think we would do it? Yeah. Yeah, right. If we were, we knew, oh, they have bass, large mouth bass on this lake. We're steAling some of those bass.

Speaker 6:          02:03:57       They'd be like a guy in Texas, they would have like a special leG you have to pay just to catch bass motherfucker and portraits of mars bass that can totally be real. Somebody tried to steal my dog out of my backyard. That's just here in America. Yeah. so of course we were doing so many different. You catch him? Yeah. That was a huge. Um, my wife said margaret's gone and my other shepherd wasn't, which is, you know, if you're a person, you know, it's weird that they're. Do hooligans always are with each other. One not going to go. I'm not going to leave. So I was in New York, thought we lost it. I'm cutting off too. Sorry. but I thouGht we lost our dog. So it's day three

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       and I'm just beyond bombed. I'm like, my doG got out and where I live up in the hills, I'm like coyotes to doug. She's kind of uh, so uh, you know, she's probably dead. So then before I go perform, I just go to craigslist just for, I just type in craig's list. Then I go found or lost shepherd. This ad pops up saying free dog and it's a picture of my dog, a super friendly, well trained, um, you know, had a list of all of her things. And then a phone number. Oh my god. So then I called the guy and go, hey bud, like I'm excited. Like, yes, you know, you found my dog. Thank you. And the guy goes, well, she didn't have a tag on her. I'm like, she always has a tag. She must've got out and then the tay got got taken off or her collar, which is in pot like that doesn't happen unless she hits a picket fence and rips it off.

Speaker 2:          02:05:32       So I go, but you have my dog. And he goes, well, it doesn't have a tag, so I don't know if it's your dog. And I go, it is my dog. And then I even sent the guy a picture of her that you would match up and go, those are my dogs. And then the guy says, uh, well In a dog owner that lets their dog get out, probably doesn't deserve to have that dog. So now I'm like, motherfucker, are you not going to give me my dog? He goes, I gave the dog away. I already, somebody already called the door thing and I go, you had my had my fucking dog, do we do, can I have the number to the person that you gave the dog to? And he's like, no. So now I'm going crazy. Like, now I'm like, motherfucker, blah blah blah blah.

Speaker 2:          02:06:16       So then I called my wife, I go, I found the person who has a dog but they're not going to give it to her. So then I even posted it on my fan page and there's some cops in, in this area is like, if you have his phone number, we'll, we can, we can go to a guy's house and say, I mean, that's because somebody said that still, you know, he has stolen property so you have a little bit of recourse. So, uh, I'm uh, at gotham in New York, you know, the door guys that work there, they're all old tops, like great, great guy. So he goes to one of the guys, goes put the guy on the phone with me, get me on the phone because I'm going to tell him I would hate it. It's too bad you committed suicide over the last doc.

Speaker 2:          02:07:00       It's too bad you decided to like, he was like, this is how you talk to that guy. You go stop being. So my wife calls him and then he ends up giving the number two of who has my doG now to my wife, right? So then my wife calls this woman and this woman says, well, I've watched the dog for two days now, um, you know, I've spent a lot of money on food but boss. So my wife goes, this is, I didn't hear this conversation. It wasn't happy about this. She goes, I'll give you. I have 150 bucks cash on me. Can I come anD get my dog and I'll give you 150 bucks because you were nice enough to watch the dog for. So my wife now keep in mind, now I'm in New York and this is like 11 o'Clock at night, right?

Speaker 2:          02:07:45       La time. So now I'm like, don't drive to some random person's house, you know, you're crazy. So she does. Anyway, I'm drives an hour and a half away. So kate, from where your podcast is that there's a doG park that's pretty close to here, right? Would anybody be hanging out at the dog park here and then drive home an hour and a half. You don't do that in los angeles, like nothing's making sense. So then she drives to this person's house by herself. Has my other shepherd in the, in the jeep. This woman comes out with our doG and she, the woman goes, I still don't know if this is your dog. And literally as the woman I guess as you're going to have to prove it, margaret bam just takes off, you know, like lunges for my wife and was just whimpering and stuff like that. The woman grabs a hold of margaret's collar and then my wife has the collar and then my wife's like, now I gotta throw it on with this bitch.

Speaker 2:          02:08:45       Like she goes, I have to just start punching this older woman in the face to get her to let go of my dog because now it's a so then my other shepherd jumps out of the jeep, like the the driver's side window was open and the other shepherd jumps out of that window because there's now there's kind of a fight going on and then my wife has 150 bucks cash. She throws it like she literally makes it rain. She grabs, she needs an extra hand to grab the other dog now and the woman let's go of of my dog and starts like the money was going to disappear, starts reaching for the money falling and my wife just grabbed both of them and threw them in a car and she said she. She took off because she was like, this is not. This is not so long story short.

Speaker 2:          02:09:33       That's crazy. That dog in the guy. WHat dude? I've never. I've never even had the thought of actually physically wanting to kill somebody. Like you say, I'll kill that guy, but you never really like really think of it. I'm like, dude, this dude came into stole my dog and is now saying he won't and, and I have his info now, but now this guy knows where you live and uh, you know where this guy lives? No, we don't. He doesn't know where I live. I mean he made he Got your dog. Well that's true if that like, but I don't know, how am I, I have a privacy fence around my backyard. So it's pretty dog friendly. You as a dog, you can't scale the wall or get out. So someone had to get in. I don't have anY proof of any of that, but something happened.

Speaker 2:          02:10:14       So you don't know if this lady is sold or this got sold that lady that dog or gave that lady that dog. He said he gave it to her, but I think a or anywhere. I think they were running a, hey, have your dog give me money. Some money scam. Even though that seems like a lot of don't know. How would they do that? Because you contacted them. They'Re just hoping that you would find them. YeAh. So come on. that's a ridiculous scam. They would maybe contact you and say, hey, I have your dog, but anybody's going to run a scam like that. They're not going to put it in craigslist or wherever you found it. Yeah, so we found it. Yes. I gained craigslist like random. I just type the city I live in and shepherd and a picture of her, she showed up. That's so crazy. Right? Or like I can't figure out like what happened. Like none of like you said, if it's somebody who's just trying to steal dogs and sell the, the really shitty at it because there's a way easier way to do it.

Speaker 3:          02:11:05       Maybe it's all about that. The movie lost and found with david spade. Seven, seven psychopaths. That's what the dude in seven psychopaths did with the dog.

Speaker 2:          02:11:15       Well, I think it could be like, well, I eat that. I have people around me that sometimes will call and say, your dogs are barking. This. This was a while ago, there was a problem and then this person would throw oranges from his side over into my yard or like eggs and stuff like that. And Then he would call and say, your dogs are back. they're constantly barking. And that would go, yeah dude, because you're throwing, you're throwing shit at them and you're having conversations with them. Of course they're going to bark at somebody on the other side of the fence. So who knows if like a neighbor, like had somebody. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          02:11:53       My, my ex girlfriend, crazy shit has happened. My ex girlfriend had a dog and I think because it barked all the time, I think somebody poisoned it by throwing a piece of food over the side of her fence and then the dog died or it would

Speaker 2:          02:12:08       tell me what you think about that. Speaking of tHat. All right. so my dog, uh, I would always put like if I was making peanut butter sandwich or something, I get like a scoop of peanut butter and I, and I get the spoon. I know you guys had never been to one, have a spoon at my house. But I would like turn this boon and the dogs would lick the peanut butter on the spoon. A kind of after all this happened, I, I will put out a spoon with peanut butter on it and show short towards margaret. Her ears flip back and she takes off. She won't even come by me. Oh wow. So right. Because dogs learn something. So something shady happened. Like you said. I have. No, I have no. Well those dogs are really smart to. Shepherds are very smart. They're very quick.

Speaker 2:          02:12:49       Yeah, they don't. You don't got to tell him twice. They usually those are dogs or you have to be like real active with. Because they get bored, you know, that they can't just lay around like a bulldog, like one of those english bulldogs. Those are fat, lazy dogs. They'll just lay around. Shepherds would be like, okay, I gotta get out of this yard. I got to figure out where it was. Fucking yard. They'll climb trees and shit. You know, they'll escape there. Get bored. Yeah. Or smartest shit. That's where the good police dogs, shepherds and those other ones that look like shepherds was belgian and ellen was like, oh yeah, matt malamutes. Malcolm was, I think they're called the malamute, two different dogs. I've never owned shepherd prior to these two nights and they're great. I've had like golden retrievers like, but my shepherd's aren't like, people are afraid of them because they look, you know, if you see them, you go, uh, that's

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       there. That my brother and his wife, they have rottweilers and I've never been in it for. You just have mentally in your head like, oh, rottweilers are rough. They couldn't be a nicer dog. Those are good dogs. Like if you raised right. I had a buddy of mine who had a really good one. It was a sweetheart. The drunk kids like him, five-year-old, he earth. He's three liaison. The rottweiler, like he's watching tv and the dog will just sit there and I started wrestling with them a little bit or like tickle fighting. The rottweiler came in between us and just kind of plopped down just to kind of go, okay, we've had enough of the tickle fight. Dogs are interesting because so much of a dog's personality is based on the breeder and how well the breeder takes care of the parents. And the generations before, like I got this dog that's a regency mast, if you ever seen my tongue.

Speaker 6:          02:14:24       Yeah, his dad was on fear factor and his dad was so chill. He was just such a sweet dog. He's just hanging out. Like he was just like real calm and like real sweet. But then he used them as an attack dog. Like he had a big dog. So you like taken out people in those big attack dog suits and this guy, he won't even breed dogs if they have any aggression towards people because any growlin or barking at eight, like he'll try and take their food away. He'll do all kinds of different things to test them and he'll, he's always kind to them. But if they show any sign of aggression towards people, he doesn't breed them. And so because of that he has is like really calm, really sweet, really confident dogs. And a lot of like dog breeds depend upon who's raising them.

Speaker 6:          02:15:08       What qualities are trying to get out of the dog. And if they're really strict like this guy joe was, then you get like this amazing dog. Like my dog, johnny, he's like the sweetest dog ever had. He's so friendly. Like I, I, my, my four year old will bring friends over and they'll play with him. I have no fear. It's just a gentle giant. Like he. He's never even. I've seen dogs bite him and he doesn't even fight back. He's like, hey, what the fuck man? Why you whitened me? No, he's just a big sweetie. Just to kind kind dog that I have visions now because I'm looking at property in the midwest. Just for you doing john heffrons exit strategy. Trying to fucking prep us. Yeah. You're a prepper where I just want to sit in a lawn chair with one of the, like those tennis about things.

Speaker 6:          02:15:51       We go to unc and it shoots the tennis ball and let my dog do sprints. So you jusT want to like train them. I just want to sit there. I think that would be the greatest. Just spring day. Just sit there. I knew a dude who went through one of those. Sun training is some that is. I try to do it with my, with margaret, but that they said she was too friendly, like kit, the agitator, because you need to get a little bit of it and they're like, yeah, she doesn't. That's fine. He just wants to. Yeah. How old was she when you try to do it to her? Whatever. A year, year and a half. Like they say you shake your shake like a candle to make a lot of noise and some dogs will take off and their dogs will go to it like so it all, you know.

Speaker 6:          02:16:33       Hm. LIke whether or not they're aggressive. Yeah. Like if there. But there's levels of that training I've seen. Did you see that? There's a facebook video. This guy just says a couple of words and there's a fight like so guys are fighting. The guy says some words and then the shepherd runs to the baby and sits there and then one, one of the guys fighting turns to then go towards the baby. The shepherd goes, nope. And attacks to get like the guys in suits, but they're like doing drills and the train this. So they're like those. You ever seen those a dupont registry magazines. It's like all like weird rich people. Shit like watches the cost half a million bucks. And rob report. Robb report. Exactly. They always have those pages In there that are dedicated to these train german shepherds and you see them sitting there guarding a crib. Loyal guardian and like what I do for a living that. yeah, it was a lot of people out there that are just worried too. I would totally staring out the windows was my fucking killers. Tack dog. You know what I watched the other day? A elephant in the living room. What are you guys doing over there?

Speaker 6:          02:17:47       Oh the. Yeah. The ads are on every one of them. I used to get that magazine. The magazine itself was like an alien because it was just fun to like go through like what movie? Oh fuck. What was I going to say? Elephant in the room. Oh, elephant in the room. Elephant in the room is a movie about all these people that keep exotic pets in their home. Like lions and shit. Like this guy had this weird relationship with this lion and it would go in the cage with a lion and hug it and he's like, this lion, you know, kept me alive. If I didn't have this line, I would have been dead. You know, I had my broke my back in a truck driving accident. I was all fucked up on pills and I got this lion and it's like, it's so weird.

Speaker 6:          02:18:29       It's so weird watching this. It's like, don't they eventually kill you like a lion would even though you know you're friendly. Anything just have a bad day. And just sometimes they do. Sometimes they do, but I think if you pay attention to all these motherfuckers that have lines and how few of them actually wind up killing them. I think if you train them correctly and you were there all the time, it's probably at least reasonably safe when they seem to attack is when they get agitated. like the siegfried and roy thing. Yeah. They're like, I'm not there were thin. We're thinking that it might've been because some lady in the audience had some crazy hat on and that the tiger might've seen that hat as like a cobra, like something, a peacock, some fucking crazy animal like remember in jurassic park when the fucking Wayne Knight is trying to steal and that thing shows up in the car with them. Like maybe that's what the tiGer thought that hat was like something similar. Like something alerting him that it was about to attack will show is talking the whole time or just as

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       a performer. The tigers, you know what? Fuck this second show friday they said that it wasn't even trying to kill him. It was just dragging them out of there and that it didn't. It had no idea like the biting him on the neck would just crushes vertebrae because it's just so strong. It was trying to just get him out of there. I don't know if I buy that and I think he just got sick of working for him. It could have a guy got killed a couple of days ago or he got mauled, went into a line enclosure, climbed in. It's like the third guy this year, there was an indian guy that got killed by that big white tiger. Do you remember that? Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. That was the most ridiculous. Whenever you guys on hIs knees, like annoying the shit out of the tiger by praying.

Speaker 4:          02:20:13       He's like, ooh, he won't stop. And finally tiger's. He's like, hey, you fucking annoying bitch pam. He grabs him and just drag them over to the other side of the enclosure, like he's a pillow. Have you seen it? Know when to watch it. Put It up on this thing here so we don't get pulled from youtube. We have a strategy now for, what is it showing videos. Oh yeah. Well we keep getting pulled from youtube. Every time we show videos now we don't really show them, so sort of show them over on that side. So it's not the actual video playing on our youtuBe channel. Gotcha. I get it. You know, they're trying to not have anybody steal a views from them, but I think it probably in the long run gets you more views Because people don't want to see it just on the podcast.

Speaker 4:          02:20:56       They want to tell their friends about it. Did you hear the link? And then they're gonna go to the actual length. But I get it. I guess they called fair use. I don't know what Fair use is. I'm not exactly sure. It seems debatable. There's like a debatable definition for fair use. Anyway, this fucking dude gets jacked. That's what's important. John fraud. This guy gets fucking jacked and he's, for whatever reason, he thinks it's smart to uh, to fucking keep praying. Like the tiger gets like right on top of him and he just, he doesn't stay still, he doesn't play dead. He just keeps bobbing back and forth and up and down, back and forth and up and down. And eventually the tigers like, all right, I seen enough. Yeah. Oh we have to sIt through an ad. It's an indian ad, but these are americans. What's going on? They speak in english. What state farm is that? What it is? I always showing that I don't want to see this video as disturbing images not suitable for children de a lady. this lady all excited to show this. Look at tHis fucking animal hovering over that dude. My god. That's when it's killing him.

Speaker 4:          02:22:15       Like this is him dragging them off. like you can kind of see it unpixelated. well that you can get a better video, brian. You can get a real video. You don't have to show this one. There's real videos that show the actual like thing in front of them like this, but he's moving around. But who fall Indiana jumped in. I think he went to intuit it on his own. Can find the other one. You could actually see it because you see the guy like he's for whatever. Right? That's the upper one. Yeah, forever. Whatever reason. He's like, he won't stop moving. Yeah. The daily motion is going to give you the real deal. Daily motion in live leak. Those are dark websites. Yeah. Here it is. Yeah. Lively doesn't fuck around. Look at this. This guy is just sitting there and there's this giant beast look scenes constantly moving and the cat is like, you're not supposed to be here. fucker. Why you moving so much? Yeah, I mean it's. What can you do there? That feather in front of my cat. My cat events. Look at him. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:23:19       Oh my god. This is so hard to watch. You're not getting out because if the tiger can't get out, you can't get out. That thing can jump 14 feet in the air. It can't get out. You're fucked. So you're just going to have to get eaten. Son. This is. I don't think there's any other way around it. What do you do? Do you get up and go, hey, I'm going to go over here real quick. Can you try to think of the zoo people will be coming out with. They're like, what the fuck they do in India? That's probably one dude. He's probably like, yeah, cleaned the monkey cage right now. He's over euros chick like it's a mine in the tiger cage. What? Hold on. He's got a text. Text comes in and he's to text her. Hold on, I go back. there's a man at a tiger cage. What? This tiger is getting annoyed with this dude. I think people were like yelling at him to like, hey, you get the fuck away from here. Oh shit, this is the tiger moved in these dummies. They're focusing on people's sneakers because they're not paying attention. See tHese fuckheads shitty video here. Here it is. Oh my god. it's fucking him up. So he goes down.

Speaker 4:          02:24:28       Oh my god. See that when it like pulled. Oh, and here's where it gets dark. It just grabs him by the neck and just carries them away. Look at that. Look how easy It karen. Yeah, right. And that guy, and he's like 130 pounds. Probably 140 character is nothing jumps over ravine with them. I mean it's got this enclosure, it's like a swimming pool type thing and it just goes right up the side of it. Like it's nothing. Oh, what a way to die. I mean, what a dumb idea in a goofy way to die. But like lions, there's a guy that made it into a line and closure and he was trying to convert the lion to christianity. whereas yeah, there's a video of that and alliance just start fucking him up. Pull that, pull that up. LIon tries to convert man to christianity. It's, it's, it just fucked this dude up. It's hilarious. There's

Speaker 2:          02:25:23       people in 2014 still want to give it a try. Yeah, just fucking. I think I can get in there and just this line needs to be done with jesus. Poor bastard. Look at this. He's out there proselytizing to lions. Look is waving his hands.

Speaker 2:          02:25:42       I think this was in China. Am I correct? Yeah. Okay. This guy, he's standing there just annoying the shit out of alliance. They're not even fucking with them. Look at that. Oh my god. it just finally just sat down and he's getting a rash. Like, listen, I know you're lashing out, but it's because you don't have the lord that lions scratch the shit out of him. But look, the lion doesn't want anything to do with them. The lich not trying to kill him. Just this fucking dummy just won't get ghost. Yeah, we get this. Oh, you bitch it just bit him. oh motherfucker not. Not trying to kill him. He just doesn't want him. Does. Doesn't want him around. He needs to figure out a way to get the fuck out of dodge and then the white. He's so stupid. He. Oh shit. Oh, it's clawing at. It bites his leg. Oh my god. That has to hurt.

Speaker 2:          02:26:35       Yeah. Oh my god. This guy's lucky. That lion is like really sweet. That's a nice light. They get lost a couple of times. The line has to attack him. I mean it's like lot. I don't remember either. I don't think he does. As a matter of fact, I think he makes it through this, but the lion actually just doesn't want him there and he standing there. May christ compel you. Oh, this guy's got a gun out. Ready to shoot the line. The case of the lion takes. He should shoot that guy. That's what he should do. You fucking idiot. by the power of christ. The lion lies down in front of them. Jesus made that lie and lie down. Yeah. Now the guy's going to get cocky and walk forward. Oh, they're got a tranquilizer dart it. They should just tranq him shooting him right in the dick. Fucking retard. What kind of a dumb ass. They got their stretcher ready. They know this guy's bleeding profusely. Okay. they tracked it. They drank the cat's wow. They trank the cats for a dumb ass.

Speaker 2:          02:27:35       look at him. He's okay at a big ass bite and his leg. They stitched him up. What a dummy. God damn. people are silly. Jon [inaudible]. What the fuck is that about? That his wife was like next to him like, are you going to beat this guy's ass or goodness. Whose wife the the line. I just pretended that that other line that was confused, like, how do You know? There's like 10 people around. how do you know who's married to who? John half run with magical powers. Do you have? My wife called me out on that. She used to watch the kardashians and I'd always just go. It's just making it just it gum. It makes you dumber than human being watching. But the one of the husbands on there, I don't know enough, the guy who looks like a psycho white dude with his slicked back hair.

Speaker 2:          02:28:21       Do you guys know whatever, whatever his name is, but they know who I'm talking about. He's married to the older sister. Every time he would see that as a joke, I will look at my wife and go. If I ever saw that guy, I would kick them right in the head. The first thing I would do that to me so much. You have to watch it to see. He kind of gets under your skin. It seems like an unreasonable way to deal with people. So I would go, man, I would just. I would kick the guy right in the head. He just seems like a thing. So we're in calabasas. This was, you know, after me saying this, every single time I've ever seen the show, we're in calabasas at the bookstore. I'm walking down the aisle with my wife. He turns into the aisle and starts walking towards us. And then the whole time he's walking towards us. My wife has gone, well, here's your chance. Here's your, here's your chance. BIg guys. He's coming right now and then part of me was like, okay, do I got to kick him in the head just so I get street cred with my wife or whatever when we obviously walked by him and then my wife goes, I'll talk. You just all talk.

Speaker 3:          02:29:17       Yeah, that game's no fun because. Because last night we were at the comedy store and louis ck was playing and we have the same thing and my girlfriends is leonardo dicaprio and they fucking walks by leonardo.

Speaker 2:          02:29:30       Yeah. You can't play that year over whatever It is, whatever it's called, they you get one celebrity to hook up with. Not if you live in la because you have chances that you're going to run in. That's you know. No way. If you're a leonardo dicaprio, you probably can't live anywhere other than la. Like leonardo dicaprio tried to move to Nebraska. Like people would like. There'd be like tours. People would Fly out. Like that's where leonardo dicaprio is. We'll go out to his. He's got a farm up there in Nebraska. Like I remember there was a thing about val kilmer, like val kilmer had a uh, a place that he put out in a New Mexico. Yeah, yeah. He had some crazy ranch. I think he still does, but like he just retired some ranch in New Mexico and everybody would just be like walking around the ramps, like a fucking batman lives in that place and he was fucking ice from top gun, you know? And yeah, he lives in this, this ranch that's like right there. and everybody would be like, what the fuck? It's almost like you want to like go there just to see if it's real. Like you'd want to like look over the hedges, like what's going on over there. I can imagine if you're him and you just, every time you leave your house to a bunch of people peering over your hedges, staring at you, you have a.

Speaker 2:          02:30:43       If you're really famous you have to stay in la because then that way you get watered down a little. LIke it just naturally you. Well you definitely get watered down like, yeah, sure. At to the gym that I used to go to, I'd walk in there at any given time, the rock would be there, alec baldwin, the sweetlife life is zack and cody kids. And then every famous porn star. But it was really weird because you just see and tHen you know, you just signed a treadmill next to the rock and after like week two, it was just like, yeah, you get used to some people. I watched a guy go up to the rock, the rock always did you have headphones on. And when he's like lifting, he kinda has this look of, I'm, I'm working out, you know, it kind of has to. So uh, so this guy walks over to him and says, hey, could you, could you help me out?

Speaker 2:          02:31:34       And you saw him, he took off his head, you know, he was mid workout. He's like doing squats or something. Ask somebody. But the rocks is probably one of the nicest guys I've ever seen. Like on a side note, like I've seen him on flight at 6:00 in the morning tea with his head up against the window and hat down and little kids tapping on them and then he put his head up, throw on the smile, signed for the kid and then go back to sleep for a second to the next kid and he's never not seen him be cool like that. So at the gym he walks over to the guy and I'm now I'm just like staring at the guy goes, I'm going to do these preacher curves. Can you tell me if I'm doing them right? Oh girls like the one, like probably the only weight lifting technique. You don't need actual post my like a squat. You could go my doing tHis. Okay. But like a curl I felt so bad for. And then mid curl can we be friends? So what are you doing later? I mean we need to go. Let me leave a voice message from my wife. Will you go facetime with my kids?

Speaker 2:          02:32:34       He's hercules. Kids get very excited to facetime with hercules' girl's dead man. That dude who jump on a stairmaster or whatever, there was no nobody next to him. Within seconds there'll be dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. Everybody. Yeah. He's a super huge dude. He's gigantic. Could you want me to. I've seen them in different phases of a pussy magnet almost. I mean, it must be like a black hole, like a singularity of sexual attraction. He's like six foot three, right? Six threeish boarish. Someone else built like a brick shit house and he's a movie star goes lower. Seen those pictures that he would. Probably not that he posts pictures on instagram when he's working out. Yeah. Like his cheat days are like the legendary legendary for big, huge pizzas and never seen anything like that in your life. Yeah. IT's legendary. What is this car? That's just the part of the diet is just like one day a week you can eat.

Speaker 2:          02:33:34       Like, I'm just like crazy man. Yeah. Some guys do that. They're super strIct except one day and um, one day they just go off your brow. You know? Remember when eddie bravo yesterday and sunday, I think it was, and he would just the ice cream, huge sundaes pizza. He would be like atkins, atkins for five days, six days rather. Sometimes you'd go five days to do like two cheat days, but it would be super strict on those atkins days, like all salads and meats and very little carbohydrate other than like natural carbs. So would come from fruits and vegetables and things like that. Yeah, and then the the last day was just donuts and pizza. You go off like a rocket and you didn't give a fuck and he lived for those days and then they started starting those days like midnight on thursday,

Speaker 6:          02:34:19       three days and four. Then it's like, I'm on atkins one day a week. They do it on mondays. Atkins is weird, man. That's not. Nobody really follows that anymore. Like people would say that it gives him bad breath and I guess the. The idea behind it is if you have no carbs like that, your body just starts to living off fats and you can do it I guess as long as you like. Really make sure you have the right amount of fats. I tried it for a little while, man, and it made me really feel weak, like I didn't feel good cutting out like potatoes and all that stuff. I think cutting it the best I've ever felt with like an experimental diet. It was cutting out gluten and I know that's like a fad thing to say like that and it's so sad that people don't wanna admit anymore, but the reality is this is the simple reality.

Speaker 6:          02:35:04       The reality about breads is they break down and become sugar. Pasta becomes sugar. That's the real issue. I think more so than like gluten intolerance and a lot of these other things that people claim. I think the amount of gluten that we have in our diet from sandwiches and breads and pastas and things along those lines, the amount is a lot of sugar that goes into your body and that's just not healthy. It's just spikes your levels. Your insulin gets all out of whack. It's just not healthy to have a regular sugar intake of processed wheat, you know all that shit. That's like a normal part of the american diet. It's just not that good for you, but you know a little bit every now and then was no big deal. It's like if as long as you eat mostly like healthy foods, you could fuck around a little bit every now and then your body's getting all the nutrients it needs and you just sort of rewarding it with that other stuff is the problem is when people have a diet that's primarily reward and then occasionally they fuck around with some lettuce.

Speaker 6:          02:36:02       You know what I mean? Like that'S smoothie smoothie today. Some good fucking people. Especially if you're working all the time, you're tired, you know, you're at the office. I'm just going to grab some jack in the box the way over. You can get in that fucking, you know, I'm trying to figure out on the road. This is the, how do. I mean I'm, I'm skinny, but I'm starting to become skinny fat. Like do workout big. Um, yeah, do a little bit. You don't box with anybody anymore. You're saying stuff that I've kind of just a workout. I don't know. I'm kind of bored with them, so I'm trying to figure out what my new thing is. When you get like a personal trainer and in those towns, you know, you could do that. find someone at the gym, they'll put you through like a weight lift and work out.

Speaker 6:          02:36:40       That'd be fun. You'll have forced you to do it. So I need like a, like a. Yeah. Because my, my new thing was I'm going to go thing, I'm going to do pull ups, dips, pushups, and then I'm going to do sprints and then that's going to be it just in case I ever get arrested. Then I've started my prison workouts. Um, just because I don't. Yeah, I got to figure out something because I'm at that line, you know, when, when you go. Okay. I think everybody at some point, if you look at them, they look like they've given up and sometimes that decision is, is later in their lives where I think I'm teetering at that, at that decision

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       going, I might just give up one doughnut that never work out and just be done. Um, what was that book that you gave bill? Some workout book? Bodyweight workout book? Yeah. It's just um, her name is like, it's a weird like della rae, r I e like if you go visual workouts in just type that name, it's called visual workouts. It's 100 at her book Is like a hundred body weight. She's just rushing chick. But what she does is she has, she calls the workout like, like movie titles, like highlander on batman. So then batman will be like 40 punches, 40 pushups, you know, she has a whole thing and then you have, do you go through it three times? Seven times. So for me it's just like a fun no brainer. I can do it in the, in my hotel room. I just turn the page and she gives away the book for free on our website.

Speaker 2:          02:38:11       You can download the pdfs. I ordered the book from amazon because I didn't feel like printing it up on my printer. That's so cool. What's it called again? Go. Um, hold on. I'm going to look up my, uh, visual workouts by nela re already. Why? Yeah, go check out her her website. I watched. Okay, cool. One video of hers. She's like just rushing chicken. She used to be a fighter. She used to think, do you know ne ne I l a? Yeah. Yeah, I would say neil, but neil re work out cards by neil aura. She has a website. Any I l o r e y.com. The book that I l a r e y.com. So the book that I had, I, like I said I just bought it. She gives it away for free but I didn't feel like a printing it all up.

Speaker 2:          02:39:03       Oh that's cool. Download and print. I love that. she's given away for free. I think. Here's her thing where she gives like you'll see some of these workouts that have 500,000 downloads and then she has a a donate button and then she goes, I don't try to sell you anything on here if you ever feel like donating. So I think it's a numbers game. If 500,000 people downloaded her, her ab challenge, you know, in a few of those people go, you know what, I'm going to throw her 20 bucks for giving out. I bet you she does. Okay. Yeah. Well now maybe she'll get more, you know, it sounds cool though. I liked that last one you circled was the pillow one. She has a lot of like weird stuff. Like I say like throw nice to the pillow pillow strikes like you're walking a wall with a pillow pillow.

Speaker 2:          02:39:55       Lunges. How weird. But she does that with like your, your carry on luggage and then she has these other workouts where you just put like four strips of tape on the ground and you do a bunch of stuff with that. You do. So I just, paige and I pick whatever you. I flipped the book and I like do that. Like throw a dart and guts. Pretty dope. Here's the love it man. It's pretty good stuff. Love it. And then you can change up the, you know, the, I haven't been able to do one of hers more than like three times through because then I, then I get bored. But uh, you know, he could add more challenges to it and stuff. That's interesting. I like that she's doing it that way, that she's a releasing them for free online and ordering, like having like a paypal button or something like that.

Speaker 2:          02:40:40       That's cool. Yeah. If you want to give her five bucks for it. But she has like 90 day challenges where she has one of those visuals everyday. You do some. So she gives you these crazy. Yeah. I don't know what she's doing there. Oh, that's the wrong 2000, 250 pushups in seven days. oh my god. She don't want her choke you. It was a fucking tremendous job. Yes, she used to do. I think it keeps kickboxer in jujitsu or something because she has a lot of fighting bodyweight exercises, man, just yoga. If you know, I have a yoga book that I bring with me some time on the road now. Also have yoga cards and I just started using it myself like 10 cards and go through these 10, 10 different poses for doing plug in 90 count. I like hold each pose for a 90 count.

Speaker 2:          02:41:25       We do a like an ipad one. Oh yeah, no, there's a couple. my wife, we do yoga every night like we were stuck. We started with ddp yoga. Ddps good that that was my first thing. I go, okay, I'm going to do yoga. explain ddp do people don't know what you're talking about. Ddp is diamond dallas page from wrestling fame and he had this yoga that he created. It was originally called like every guy yoga because the whole thing is. It's not like artsy fartsy your momma's yoga. Yeah, exactly that. Yeah. And then, but when you watch him, he like actually is instructions really cool. It's not. You do like hulk out, so you do like of this guy. Then hawk it out and then you just do and then you stretch the whole and it's. It's hard. Oh, it's definitely a lot of them. I have to like, I have to go to a knee and go, okay, and then you keep doing it for a couple of weeks.

Speaker 2:          02:42:14       You're like, okay, now I can hold its. I think yoga out of. I mean I'm not an expert at all, but I think if you stick with yoga consistently your whole life, you're going to be like staying, you know, at the end where you're not going to bust the hip when you're like 90. You know what I mean? Definitely something that's a lot more difficult to do than people think it is. I can't really good word. I can't do hardly anything. It's unbelievable how unflexible land. Well, yoga iS just, it's a lot more difficult than people think it is. It's like, it seems like it would be easy to do. Like all those indian dudes are all skinny, you know, and you look at chicks are all doing it. You're like, well this isn't going to be like fucking running up a mountain. But yeah, It is. It's own way. My wife's a mom. Oh she, I don't know. I don't want to operate, but late sixties, maybe even seventies, japanese woman. She can. She puts her hand like that and they can go perfectly straight up just holding like, that's incredible. She's

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       70. whoa. Yeah. As long as you keep using it, man. I can fucking stallone. I mean that's the most ridiculous example ever of a grampy. He's like 67, 68 years old, I think. At least. How old is that dude now you always got to be at least. I would say 68, right? Let's say 68. Seventy two. Seventy two, 72 while he's going to be eventually if you stayed in the law, but when people like, oh, he's going to get off those steroids. Like what are you talking about? What's he's to what? Sixty eight, 68? Yeah, he is. I mean, it's ridiculous. The Idea that if somehow or another he got off of them like what? He's going to like live 70 years, got to run. I'm doing all that stuff. When I'm don't know. I think I'm going to get myself a couple more years and then I figure I can outrun all the side effects.

Speaker 4:          02:44:00       Well, he broke his neck when he was filming the expendables and he was like 65 years old. He fucking fell like they were doing like some stunt and land on his fucking neck and snapped his neck. And he's got like disks that are fused in his neck. He liked put up an x ray online. It showed it. Here's the crazy shit ever. It's going to a fused disc in his neck and he's 67, 68 years old. What the fuck man? Like when we were kids, a 68 year old dude was basically dead. Right. You know, it's like barely hanging on. And when, um, when they come up with, if you've seen that thing they're doing with mice that, that gene doping. No, no, no, no. Blood, just blood. They're taking the mice have young mice and introducing it to old mice putting in an old mouse.

Speaker 4:          02:44:47       His body and the old mouse starts literally going back in time like, yeah. And they've started, they've started doing clinical trials with people and are having positive results. Eating babies would make us no, no need transfusions, but here's the thing, there was an episode of a goddamn. I quote this website, this podcast all the time, but it's not like I'm not like their publicist or anything. I just really think it's awesOme. Radiolab. Radiolab is one of the best podcasts. Amazing. So informative and interesting. It's like the sound effects, like really well engineered. IT's like the opposite of like how we do it. We just start and you know, we fuck around, we talk and then we end it with radiolab. Everything's planned out. It's all really like well edited and research and they brIng in different sound effects and different people and they have anyway, they had this one on blood and the reality of like blood donating and then they sell your blood and a lot of the blood that you donate doesn't ever go to patients and a lot of it doesn't go. Like if you donate blood, they're actually going to sell your donated blood to other hospitals for a profit. Yeah, it's crazy. It's really crazy. If you. I'm trying to remember the episode here. I'll, I'll said radio lab. Yeah. Radio lab episode on blood. I'll google that real quick. He always wondered about that because I used to give plasma like twice a week just to make money and I always wondered if this was

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       sold or just I was donating. It never really Made sense that I was getting money for this. IT's called blood and I think this one deals with uh, aids as well because there was a guy who had hiv and he was doing some art with his blood and he got labeled a terrorist. I think it's one of the same ones, but um, it's really interesting. I think that's the episode they would like. What stuff? I mean, that's season 12 problems had 12 seasons. My god, what steps can be ready for our bodies, you know, to go back in time a little by the tIme, let's say add 20 years from now I'll be 40, 50, I'll be in only my fixtures, but I'm hoping by then they'll have something go. Yeah, this is a new. Yeah, we figured out how to take your gums then.

Speaker 2:          02:47:03       Yeah, no, well what they're doing is apparently they're there, you know you can take blood out of people and you can donate it and your body can produce extra blood. Like if you take blood out, your body replenisHes that blood and if you get a bunch of people to do that and they sell that blood and say if they're young you get like a bunch of college kids to do that to their blood and then you take this 20 year olds blood and the the introduced into your body or your body like literally reverses the aging process. You start, your memory starts working better and then conversely when you take old blood and you pour it into a young kid's body, they start getting sluggish. That's the thing that they're not doing that with people but they are doing that with. Maybe they are. Maybe they aren't doing the people because they did it with mice.

Speaker 2:          02:47:45       I mean I don't think it would hurt them necessarily physically, but it might, you know, who knows. We found out a gave kids like fucking alzheimer's early or something crazy, but they're taking old blood with mice and they're introducing it to the young mice and it fucks them up for you. It sounds like a sCary movie where eventually we start harvesting 20 year olds, so it's kinDa like logan's run in the sense of you can live until you're 20, But during 20 through 30 or harvest and maybe some guy doesn't want to be harvested. So he hides and runs well. They're going to be able to Call it a harvest. They're going to be able to make artificial organs if they haven't already. They already can make artificial bladder, so I know that they're taking skin cells and they've created an artificial bladder. If they make artificial organs, they're eventually going to move from that to an artificial Body without a head.

Speaker 2:          02:48:31       You know they're going to have your fucking body, like an exact version of your body with no head and they'll Be able to take stuff from it. Take lungs. Yeah. These with a three d printer. They just. Which I'm going to get so bad, buT I. I don't know what I would print, but it's one of those things and you're like, man, it would be. I saw some kid tHree d printed because I follow three d printing, whatever on twitter. So they always like tweet, you know, shut some kid. Three d printed a laser engraver for 50 bucks. So the laser engraver was like a couple thousand dollars. He printed it on a three d printer, made it a plastic and then he engraves metal or whatever for some company that he just does out of his garage. But he's like, that's what I wantEd. A three d printer.

Speaker 2:          02:49:18       You can print anything. I just, it would just sit there like a stairmaster, not be used like I wouldn't know, but they sell it at a office depot. They have this thing you put down and you can put an object and then it takes a three d picture that's like 2000 bucks and then a three d printer is, you know, it's plastic. It makes sense. A plastic. Yeah. But now they have all this different stuff. You can do it for food now, like pastas you can create but are plastic or wood, like they're coming for the future of olive garden or restaurants. You're just, the whole kitchen is just going to be printed like you order it. And scott, I want to three d print, anything you, anything that busts in here? Dude, you can just three d print and remake. I bet it's the future of objects themselves.

Speaker 2:          02:49:59       I bet we're not going to log into going to have store. So just going to download the plans for something like on itunes. There's a, you don't have to look up the video, but there's the three d printed a house and this huge, this huge thing that just comes in, like build completely prints a house. Seeing the nuts. And then uh, I saw my wife was looking at a shoe one where a company, exactly what you said. Go, here's your shoes. And then you go, I want purple. The, you know, I'm like, I need a night shoot because I'm going on blah blah blah. And you can, you get the pair of shoes is printed, you know, this is like we're making it all work. It's a big deal. But in 10 years from now, it's going to be like, remember when we figured out smoke signals? John heifer, we're out of time. A pleasure. Always a pleasure. My dare you. How dare you get needy. What, uh, your, uh, your twitter handle is john j, o h n h e f, f ron and website is john [inaudible] dot com. Facebook slash john hepburn. Anything pretty much john heparin
