You Go, we were just talking about this and you're like, yeah, you got so many crazy stories that have happened to you and it and, and, but I never think that, I think there are just things in my life. I think it's my ability, the way I see something happen is different than a way everyone else sees it happen. You know, I see the, the little thing that, that registers in me, I go all, that's my thing. You know, and it lights up for me where my wife just glazes over it and it's come to light in this podcast more than anything. The machine, I mean, the way I've told the story to fucking a million people, but then when I told him to do something lit up and I went, oh, that is a good story, right?

Speaker 1:          00:38          The fucking fighting a bear. The fuck everything. I'm getting mauled by a bull, Tracy Morgan, everything's lights up. So then I'm talking on the phone today.
