Speaker 1:          00:00          The general experience. Yeah. That's the problem. Those guys aren't woke once. Everyone's all woke. It'll be great. It's a dangerous word to use. I feel like people got to mock it in the future. Woke woke. Yeah. I felt like using woke now like unironically super slippery. I see a trap coming. You do. The jujitsu practitioner in me is like, I don't like this move. This is a. I know where this leads. That's how I feel. I see that woke thing. I'm like, what are you woke? What the fuck does that even mean? I don't look up. You woke up. What do you 12? Well, it comes from my 16 year old, so yeah, it's kids today. But what does it mean? It means your brain is open. You're open to stuff. The problem is there's no real quantification. There's no real. There's no test you take to show that if you're woke.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Right? Right. Like if you want to be a mathematician, you have the fucking show that you know how to do math. The professor said, check your work. Like you get through like, yes, congratulations Tom. Papa. You are a mathematician. Phd In mathematics, it says right here on the paper and you're like, God damn it, I'm going to put this shit on my walls. You understand? I know how this stuff works. Yeah, but wokeness, anybody can claim to be a master of wokeness. It's like Kung Fu without fighting. It's very dangerous. Yeah. No one's defined what's woke and what's preposterous. No one's defined what's, what's just not racist and sexist and not homophobic, but open minded and aware of the, the, the failings and the misgivings of all sides of us and with no bias. Right. Is that. Well, because it doesn't seem like it is. Isn't that woke?

Speaker 1:          01:38          I don't know. I don't think so. I think you just described what I thought it was. I would like that, but too many people could jump in. There's no. There's no real clear understanding of like what makes an constitutes someone being woke like. Yeah. How many of those boxes do you have to check where it was like, stop Tom. Papa had a woke academy and you took these people. It would just mean to you like bread or bread claiming wokeness super slippery. What's his Jamie? 62 New York Times magazine or crazy gotta. Dig It. Look, if you're woke, you dig it. Almost the perfect definition right there. If you're woke, you dig it. That is insane. That was my fox man. And you were copying my taste and grit. Don't jump salty on me. Whoa. Look how they talked back then they were trying to talk people into talking the way that made them seem more interesting. I'm going to say it the way I would say that if I lived back then. Hey, make it bigger so I can see why you'd be the guy on the left. Jamie. No, no, no. Scrolling. So we could read the comments. What he's saying. Up Top. Yeah. Okay. That was, that was my facts man. And you were coding grace and grit. So how would you say that now?

Speaker 1:          03:00          That was my fox man. Maybe cop in my taste. And of course it's girl on girl. And you're saying no, that's what they said. Oh, would you use. What words would you use today? Yeah. Yeah. He would say the fuck he doing with my girlfriend. Dickhead. And he said, don't jump salty on me. I would say, hey, we're cool. No worries, no worries. Stop being such a bitch. It's all good. It's all good. Yeah. And then it'd be like, what? Someone's a bitch. And then next thing you know, people will be hitting each other. That's the darkest snowman. I think what you're saying is one very important point that we need to move past the military gatekeepers of tech.

Speaker 2:          03:40          No big tech which are at advertising agencies in social media,

Speaker 1:          03:48          the things that are constantly predicting your next purchase,

Speaker 2:          03:52          right? Yeah. Because if you think, if you think about it, and I'm in even in a semi democracy look like we have in the US, I mean those who control the brainwashing of the public in essence control who votes for what and who controls the brainwashing of the public is advertising agencies and who increasingly are the biggest advertising agencies are, are the big tech companies who are accumulating everybody's data and using it to, to program their minds to buy things. So this is what's programmed the global brain of, of, of the human race. And of course there are close links between big tech and the military. Let's look at. Amazon has $25,000 person headquarters in Crystal City, Virginia right next to the Pentagon. And in China it's even more direct and unapologetic. Right? So it's a new military industrial advertising complex, which is guiding the evolution of the global brain on the planet,

Speaker 1:          04:55          which that with this past election, right, with all the intrusion by foreign entities trying to influence the election that they've, these giant houses set up to write bad stories about whoever they don't want to be in office.

Speaker 2:          05:10          Yeah. In a way that's almost a red herring, but it, I mean the Russian stuff is almost a red herring. But it revealed what the processes are, which, which are used to program. Oh, because I think the whatever programming of the American's minds is done by the Russians is minuscule compared to the programming of Americans' minds by the American American corporate and government elite.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Not that anybody's even jumping in as well as African elite. So my dad, my dad dance limbo, right? My Dad was the baddest limbo dance on the planet. Really. And he did some crazy, crazy stuff. You might need to try it again. It didn't. I think. Oh, probably when I closed my phone. Okay. There we go. Waiting for Jamie to grab it and I'll leave it open. I'm no, my dad used to dance limbo and I'm limos when you go onto the stick. Yes. Yes. And um, he, I don't wanna I don't to ruin it. Right. But he was the best jokes from like 88, like the year before he died. Wow. Yeah. So like, I dunno, it just reminds me of some of the thing and my family. Anytime I did something that I thought was cool, they would just be like, yeah, like, so wait, your dad, your dad would do that was like, fuck, like I could never get out of his shadow, but this is your dad. That's my dad. Oh, shit was fire. Yeah. Damn, how the fuck is he doing that? That is insane.

Speaker 1:          06:47          That's insane. Yeah. He did this for like tons of. If you did it from everybody wanted to see him do this. He did it in front of Mandela. Did in front of the queen know if he's going to go under it there. Yeah. But it gets better than this whole lot. Do you eat the fuck is he doing that? You don't. Kind of. Core strength. That takes blown far. But this right here now this is where it gets ridiculous. This is like, I see this and I'm like, yeah, that's my dad. Like he's going to go what? So this is on fire folks in this. This thing is I'm not bullshitting. And he's got to flaming pizzas in his hand and he's like that. That might be what? 13, 14 inches off the ground and he's going under it. That's insane. And he spit and fire while he's doing it.

Speaker 1:          07:33          Holy Shit. You weren't joking? No, my dad was a bad ass. That's crazy. How crazy they are looking at this old vhs footage digitized. It's not that long ago, man. No, and that's a different world and that, that, that kind of thing. My Dad Kinda. I mean I was always with. I used to love being with him. You know, he's like my best friend. I remember I was telling my son this story about him, so I had this thing with my kid and I'm recording this conversation with me and my son and I'm like, what would you do if you go back in time? And he's like, what? I was like, if you had a time machine you can go anywhere, where would you go? He's like, I don't know, the 19 hundreds. And I'm like, I grew up in the 1900, what are you talking about? Like last week.

Speaker 1:          08:15          And then I told him the story. I was like, yeah, remember I was little. My Dad used to, I used to bring you on stage to do that. I was like four or five years old. No, I was like four years old and he would pick me up and carried me under the, under the bar. Right. And one time he brings me on stage. He's like, this is my son. And he presents me in the spotlight's on me and I'm shy. And I'm like, oh. And he was kind of disappointed, really disappointed me that day. And then, um, a couple of weeks later I was with him again. He's like, I was like, Daddy, you bring it back on stage and he brings me on stage and um, he's about to pick me up and I'm like, I could walk away and I go back to my seat.

Speaker 1:          08:48          I did. He loved it. He loved it. You know what I told my son that story. My Dad was like, he people afterwards, we walked through the hotel to go back and he has me on his shoulders and he's just so proud. He's like, you see my boy and he's like, you know, I told my son about that and my son was like, it was like 40 minutes later in the conversation and my son is like that. If I had a time machine, I'd go back and hang out with you when your dad was like, that was like, that was like the best moment of my life. Message it. That's done. You examine your fucking brain and that takes some hard work and suffering. If you're not really do that. I'm sorry. And it seems like there's no way to do that as a bystander.

Speaker 1:          09:24          You can't watch it, man. You got to get out there and like, oh, this hurts, this hurts real fucking bad. I don't think this is smart. And then guess what happens? The body will just, it will adjust if it goes well. Then the next question again, but time when it doesn't adjust to I guess some of the stupidest shit man, like don't, don't take with a grain of fucking salt people. Those questions that people that are wanting to quit. Yes. Yes. And that's what I say. When should I quit that? God. Did you ever like feel like no, shut the fuck up. Stop. Stop. I don't want to like that. There's always that next question. No, don't take it. Like go out there and run through a brick wall. So many times you can. No, I'm not saying be me. Don't run towards you. And five miles at one time.

Speaker 1:          10:12          I'm not saying do that. I'm saying start to learn. The mind is powerful. It's powerful, man. It's unbelievable. But people need, they need a thing to get them going. Right? They need a thing, right? I need a goal. They need. They need A. I'm like, it's sometimes the first step is the hardest. It's hard to take that 1 million, step two, but sometimes the first step is the Mo is something about the, what do I do? They start going over their phone and start calling people. They don't get out of the house and there's something about procrastination. So like, you know, it's painful. You know you should be doing things, but you just keep doing it. You keep itching that I procrastinate like a motherfucker man. Every day I want to do this shit.

Speaker 1:          11:05          That's what's so funny, man. People looking like on some damn superhero that came down from the Gods, from the heavens and earth. No Man, I don't want to do this shit. I'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes. Sometimes they can fuck man. People. People look up to your Goggins fucked him. I'm like, Oh, do this shit man. What do you do it? I'm going to do it as long as you do it and that's what I know about it. That's why I stopped doing it. I'm thinking, Oh man, you gonna fucking sit here and you look at your shoes for 30, 40 minutes. You Go, you gotta think about all day long you go do it anyway. And sometimes you don't have the time to look issues for 30 minutes. Those are the, those are the beautiful days. Yes. It's, you know, you just have to go. That's right. And so like there's no room for procrastination and that's when I, when I was in the military, I love my because I knew it'd be work at 7:00. So you got to get your ass up at 4:00. Marissa get your shit in brother, because I had to get my shit and before I got my shit in know. So that was my mentality back then. Manual. Like I, I had to get the miles and get everything in man and, and get to work. Man. I'm a competing with the Alpha males.
