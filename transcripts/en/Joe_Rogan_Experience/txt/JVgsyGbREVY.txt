Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Three, two, one, boom. He got appreciate a person who shows up with not just food but booze. You showed up. He brought whiskey and fish. That's very impressive.

Speaker 2:          00:00:19       That's why it's exactly what my mom taught me.

Speaker 1:          00:00:21       Your mother taught you to bring food and booze everywhere. Exactly. Well, you got a good mom, but. So your name is you. You would introduce yourself as Valentine, but your mom calls you Valentyn.

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       It's what I wanted to choose myself to. English speaking. People say I'm Valentine. Right? But then when I speak to somebody that speaks French, I say violence in

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       volunteer. Oh, okay. Because you're from Montreal. Yes, exactly. Okay, so I found out about you online and I've read your story and it's a very interesting story because you. You were a lawyer, right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:00       Yes. I used to be low and I did my law degree in Montreal and then I did my master in law to before moving to London.

Speaker 1:          00:01:08       And now you are a spear Fisher. Yes. Full time. It's kind of crazy. That's a. that's an interesting transition. I. I'm fascinated by spear phishing. It seems like a lot of fun. It seems very exciting and dangerous and risky, but how did you go from being a lawyer? And that's a big jump. I mean, you gotta you gotta pay for an education. You had to. Well in Canada. Do you have to pay for that? How does that work?

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       Um, it's, it's Kinda cheap compared to the US differently. It's about something maybe like three, $4,000 a year. So competent us is almost free I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:01:44       Oh, that's not bad. Three, 4,000 a year, but still, that's three, 4,000 a year for many years that you decided. Yeah, I'll just rather.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       My mom definitely didn't get a good return on investment.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       No. How do they feel about you doing this?

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       Um, she still sends me university applications. Time to time, being like, hey, when I used to do something different or something, and I'm like, no, I'm not having a midlife crisis. I just don't like what it was doing. So I just picked something else. Oh, by the way, I'm going to have to apologize for my English. Seems perfect for Montreal. So French is my first language.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       Well listen, you're way better than George St Pierre who was here a couple of weeks ago and George is more hard to understand and he was fine.

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       Yeah. That I'm not going to speak like this and make enough wealth to.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       Well listen, I'm impressing anybody. You can speak more than one language. I was just in Thailand. It's just amazing that they speak English so perfectly, you know, and then their languages. So oddly different than ours. Um, you decided when to do this, like how, how deep into your, your law career were you?

Speaker 2:          00:02:51       It was about, I actually made a career switch when I moved to London in 2010, so I started working in finance. So I work for hedge funds and I basically decided on a quitting law. I didn't like the part of law at where I was stuck in one place. So you know, when you, when you study law see in Canada than you. Even in Canada it's even worse because I was studying in Quebec, which is civil law and then I was stuck in Quebec for rest of my life and I just got like, Ooh, that's not gonna happen.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       So meaning that. Okay. So like if you pass the bar in California, you would also have to pass the bar in New York if you wanted to work in New York. Exactly. Okay. That's different than. Is that the same with like if you were a doctor, would that be the case?

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       Um, countrywise I would say statewide

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       couldn't know. But state wise it is for law. Yes it is. So for you, you would have got stuck in Quebec in Quebec is a very interesting place because it kind of doesn't want to be a part of Canada.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       True. We're very different in Canada, but my biggest problem with Quebec is definitely not a culture. Anything like that is to fight that. It's an eight month long winter. It's rough. My Mom, I'm not doing what the people are amazing. It is. It's a very European city actually in Canada it's, it's people. People are very about food, about sitting outside. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:04:09       to my friends, David and Fred from Joe beef in Montreal. One of the best restaurants in the world. Every there. Yes. Woo. Woo. That's pretty good. That's a German place. So I'm sorry. So you decided you didn't want to be stuck?

Speaker 2:          00:04:25       Yeah, pretty much. I kind of got like cluster phobic of being like, Ooh, this is going to be the next 40 years of my life. How'd you get into spearfishing? I'm very weird story. I was, I got into spearfishing when I was living in London, which still doesn't make much sense. And then I, I met, I met this guy and he was like, oh, you have to try spearfishing will be so good at it. And he asked me to go do a course in Egypt the freediving. So I said, ah right, I'm going to go to Egypt. It's very big for food. I've eaten. The sea is like very clear and deep and what is beautiful and it's calm very often you can swim from shore and you have very great depth. So it's, it's really nice with that. But. So I did my course.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       I when they're literally kicking, screaming, I didn't want to go. When I was 14 years old, I almost drowned and a sat of France with my parents refused to swim in the ocean for about 10 years after that I break if I couldn't see the bottom and who was not even interested in going near the water. And then I was like, all right, I'm going to try this thing and I go there and I'm like, oh, okay. It's not too bad. No, it's not that bad. It's actually really cool. So he said, okay, well now you know how to freedive in three months. We're going to this very big spear fishing trip on ascension island. Ascension island is literally one of the biggest, most elite spearfishing destination in the world. You go hunt for big fish. It's running all over the Atlantic. It's right between Brazil and Africa. It's a island divided between the US and the UK. Oh Wow. I've never heard of it before. To people live on it. Yes they do. They have locals that. What language do they speak English. Really? Yeah. It's, it's a very, very odd place, but it's very pretty

Speaker 1:          00:06:11       and it's one of the. There is Jamie nailed it. Governor up there. What's the Google maps tells? How long does it take to get there? Finishing up in the middle of nowhere. That's crazy. In the middle of nowhere, but wow. It's between Africa and Brazil. That's fucking.

Speaker 2:          00:06:25       I don't get there. We had to go to the military base and the and the UK, which is about an hour and a half away from London and we have to take care of burl air force flight there. I was the only way to get there. There's no commercial place real as a stopover on the way from the military base in the UK to the Falklands.

Speaker 1:          00:06:43       So how does civilian get a rod on a military flight?

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       They allow about five civilians per flight. Oh Wow. So how do you book it? A travel agent or something? I, I didn't do the king myself, but I think it's like through to the airline or something. Wow. It was a weird experience. I was imagining like what I was like being strapped down and then facing the other side is actually a commercial flight just because it's bigger guys, but at the movie Predator now I was really expecting that and then I get doors opening the bag and there was like run out

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       because I have some friends that have done some gigs overseas and they have had to fly in those kind of plans. That sounds pretty cool I guess until someone shoots at you.

Speaker 2:          00:07:32       Yeah, that would make it a bad day.

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       That would change things. So when you were free diving before you went to this elite spear fishing destination, how long could you hold your breath?

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       When I started? Yeah, Siro probably like 15, 20 seconds. And so you're going there with 15, 20 seconds where the breath. I was pretty bad. I just did my deepest dive on my way. There was something like 15 meters. Oh Shit. I'm Canadian. No, that's okay. It's close enough to yard. We understand what that is. Five meters 45 feet. So it was something like that. It wasn't that great. And I actually remember my first time I went spearfishing, I was on a boat and the word was really bad. It was rocky, you know, when it sees like black black because it's raining and I was in the back of the boat, I was shaking, I was holding my little gun and I was like, what the fuck am I doing here? And like one that watching tv right now, like I don't want to be here, I don't want to be here, don't want to be here. And then my friend was like, come on, stop being a fucking pussy, just Japanese boat, just jump in the water and come. I'm like, ah. I was like, okay, I take a deep breath, I jump in. And then the water was so dark and so horrible and sharp just became super claim and there was fish everywhere and I was like, wow, this is actually pretty freaking cool.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       And you're doing this again, free diving.

Speaker 2:          00:08:49       Worried having no, no tanks. Well I take my first job so I'm a little bit clumsy because I have my gun and I'm like, oh, I don't really know how to. How to

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       five a debt and then I took a shot down my first fish and they stoned it and my friend was like, oh, I could live in a first shot. And it's haunting terms too. And Yeah. And then I, my friend was like, well you're not done, you know, you have to grab the fish, have to drag it all the way to the boat. And I was like, all right, okay. Have they finished? I have always in my face. And then like I get. It was quite a big fish. It was a big, it was good. It was a black Jack, which is not that great to eat black Jack. Yeah, probably something that many people will eat. Why wouldn't they eat it? It's a, it's edible. It's not bad. It's just not one. It's not a very flaky fish. I would say. It's a little tough. A little tough.

Speaker 4:          00:09:43       Oh, so it's just too dense or something?

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       Yeah, kind of. It's their very strong fish, so. Whoa, that's cool. It converge. That's what it looks like. A fish to dale was about like, like 25 pounds.

Speaker 4:          00:10:02       Oh Wow. Your instagram is filled with this stuff, which is, um, I guess one of the ways that I've found you have, it's hard to remember how I find people online, but your instagram is filled with you with all these cool fucking fish and all these. I mean, you look like you're living a life of adventure. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you about is that a lion fish are killed.

Speaker 3:          00:10:22       Yes. That's a lion fish. And you eat those. They taste. They probably one of the best dating, tasting fish ever. Then he realized they're fantastic.

Speaker 4:          00:10:29       Do you ever get them on them? Are they commercially available? Do they or is it

Speaker 3:          00:10:33       something you can find them at Publix in Florida. Oh really? Which is what I was very surprised about. You just have to be really careful when you harvest them, of course, because if you touch a spine, it's poisonous, very poisonous, but it's just painful. It's not deadly. Now you can get into a bloodstream epileptic shock. Oh, well good was. It didn't happen, but normally you just have like if somebody was Tommy Tommy's like, you had a hammer in your head repeatedly. Oh, it's like a throbbing pain for about a day and a half. Whoa. So I got bullied in almost. It's a paint. It's not, it's, it's. You really try to avoid it. All costs. So what would you compare the meat to hogfish so, or maybe a very tiny Chilean sea bass. Maybe that type of oily flaky.

Speaker 4:          00:11:28       Did you know what to do? We talk about this on the podcast. Chilean sea bass is not really a basket to cod

Speaker 3:          00:11:35       torch. It sounds also endangered. So good. Is it endangered? How's it on every menu? If it's endangered assholes.

Speaker 4:          00:11:44       Um, so you, you go to this one destination, you, uh, you shoot this black Jack. Were you hooked immediately? Yes. Real.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       It was not about a spearfishing part. Actually, I was still traumatized in the water, still had panics attacks when I was in the water and um, but I fell in love the second I arrived to shore and we barbecued a fish on a beach and I was like, okay, this is this. Just for me,

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       the same exact thing that happened to me when I went deer hunting when we, me and my friend Brian Cowen and Steve Rinella and Dan dody were cooking this deer meat by a fire. And I was like, this is the greatest thing ever. This is the meat was so fresh because it was like from an animal that was, you know, literally killed hours ago. And then we're eating it by, by the fire. I was like, this is, I'm going to do this forever. This is the greatest thing ever,

Speaker 2:          00:12:38       right? It is, it's you, you feel, you feel what I was taught. People list that, you know, when you live in a big city, like when I've never experienced that before. I've never felt that I was part of the ecosystem whatsoever. And then all of a sudden I've been putting myself into water when I'm surrounded by sharks are big fish or different things and I'm like, wow, we're actually not in top of the food chain at all. There's a lot of stuff on buffalo's I can kill us. And it's, it's, it's, it's carrying is humbling. And I think as a person you have to experience that. You have to, you have to put yourself out of your conference old to understand that you need to respect what's around you. You can tell me 10 years ago, Oh, you have g debt fish because it's bad for drm. And I'd be like, yeah, yeah, sure buddy. Right? And then you see an implant, you're like, Ooh, that looks good. Then it's fine and this. But then when you under water and you see what's going on and you see that a spot, you've been diving for five years old, southern is empty. Then it makes you understand that, you know, we actually have a very strong impact and it's, it's our job to, to, to understand and respect it. We're where we're at, where did ecosystem, which is the one that we're the smartest one. Sometimes

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       we're the only ones that are consciously aware of our actions and the repercussions. Yes, of our actions. What, when, when you're first experiencing this, your first time eat and this feeling of connectedness and freedom and just being a part of the ecosystem, did you imagine that somehow know that this could be your life and your job?

Speaker 2:          00:14:17       Not at all. I've, I've, I've, I've never been hiking. I'm not a big fan of. I've never used to be a big fan of the outdoors. I'm, I've, I've, I don't go to the gym, exercise, go to the gym, basically does everything and all of a sudden I was living in London and the Nice apartment with two dogs and a nice car and all of a sudden I wasn't freaking Africa camping at a Bush, catching, catching my own food and sharing with villages that had nothing to eat. And I was like, okay, well this is,

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       that happened. Like how did you go from this one trip?

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       Um, I got invited to film a documentary, food sourcing and I was like, okay, I'm going to try it, and I fell in love with it and the second I went back to London, I remember sitting in my desk and be like, there's no way I can do that. There's no way I can keep doing that for rest of my life. And everybody thought I was completely crazy. I sold everything I, I and I just left. I moved away and I, I have like maybe two suitcases of stuff for the past three years and

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       I was reading somewhere where they were going to do an interview on you and they decided not to. They are going to feature you in something with a decided not to because of concerns for the depletion of fish in the ocean. And I said, that is one of the dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard because the impact of someone like you, what you're doing for your own personal consumption, taking a fish a day or whatever you're getting for your own personal consumption is negligible in comparison to all these people that are probably writing these articles that are going to buy Sushi from commercial fishermen. They're there. They're buying fish from the store that's wrapped in Saran wrap. They're completely out of touch with mean your intouch. You're as in touch as you can get. But to think that somehow or another you're doing something evil because you take photos of it and put it on your instagram. Who was that one? You had this amazing photo from a couple days ago with you. This is big fish. It was so fresh and you, you guys were eating pieces of it. You had cut a chunk of out of out of its tail?

Speaker 2:          00:16:25       Yes. That was in Thailand? Yeah, paquette. It was. Yeah. Actually, yeah. We just went with this friend of ours with his family and we just went off for the day and we went spearfishing with my friend. We caught a fish and and the guy was super happy. He cut a right on the spot and all the kids were just speaking on it and it was. They were so excited. The second year he came, the second day came that the boat arrived back to the island. They just went and grabbed the fish and they were trying to take pictures. It was super cute.

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       What, what was the argument for not. What was the piece that they were trying to put you in where they pulled you out of it? What was that about?

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       That story is, it's still so getting me pretty angry. So basically where I was speaking at a woman empowerment conference in New York last May and then when I was actually in Thailand that the woman that is organizing it calls me and she's like, oh, look Valentine, like I need to talk to you about something. And it's, you know, it's a little touchy. I'm like, what? She's like, well, one of her sponsor said that if you speak at a conference being on a which will do participation and the conference, what was the sponsor and the Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal, and I'm like, and she said, yeah, do you feel like that's your lifestyle isn't aligned with ocean preservation and that. And she said some. She didn't say it directly, but she said, and you know me, don't mind that you

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       have pictures in a bathing suit. I'm like, what do you mean patient in my basics you. Sorry. My Burkini was not clean. Like, what do you want from me at a beach? When am I supposed to wear your also swimming? I'm swimming. You're not wearing a bathing suit. You mean? It's not like you're in your house

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       heels. You know, being an Insta model, you're wearing a bathing suit. There's nothing wrong with that either, but you're wearing a bathing suit because you're actually in the water.

Speaker 3:          00:18:14       Exactly. I'm not in Mykonos next year. Fricking pool. I'm in, I'm in. I'm in Africa on a beach when it's like 110 degrees, what am I supposed to went with Dan Bilzerian respect. So,

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       so I mean, what did you say to them? And that's Wall Street Journal that is so crazy, you know, and I get it from their perspective. It's a bullshit argument, but from their perspective it's just about optics. It's about how it looks. That's all it is. And if they go there and people love to get outraged about something, if they go there and then they go to your instagram and they find pictures of you with fish, they're like, well this girl is cleaning out the ocean. All buyers killing home. Yeah, I'm very good. You have to be really good. I mean, have you ever seen a commercial fishing boat? What they do? Yes. Most people have it. Jamie CV could pull off the horrific effects of commercial net fishing because if you find a video, we can watch a clip of the video. It's crazy when you see the sheer volume of fish that they pull out of the ocean and when you realize there's countless numbers of these boats and essentially pretty much unregulated and no one's watching them and they're doing it all over the world. I mean there's areas where you're not allowed to fish, but overall it's nothing like the way we treat wild mammals or wild birds. The way we treat wild mammals, especially in North America, is they're very closely monitored. Their numbers, their populations. We we make sure that unless it's an invasive species like wild pigs, like here we go, this is, this is awful. They take this gigantic net, they circle all these fish and then when they're pulling them in, you get to see the sheer volume so you as they get close,

Speaker 3:          00:20:08       but that's. That's. That's one of the smoother way to commercial fish. Francis ready big and it's two kilometers wide net. That is actually, it's. It's scraping the bottom completely destroying evidence during the coral stocks on each side.

Speaker 1:          00:20:26       This is actually a fairly mild one and it looks like they're getting these little tiny fish, but me, you could find it folks if you wanted to go and google it online, but that is the issue too, right? That these, these nets go all the way to the bottom and they destroy anything that they touch. Like the whole bottom of the ocean just gets dragged

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       in. All the coral gets destroyed.

Speaker 2:          00:20:50       It's this extremely destructive, but it's what? What? That's how you get Sushi. There's so much. The fish industry, it's not even necessarily how you get to Sushi. It's how you get Sushi so damn cheap, but it's. It's by DOJ. If we keep doing that is literally going to be no fish very, very, very soon. But then how do you explain to us and Canada, you know how to spearfish what and you have to release most of the fish. You run rail. There's a lot of stories. Most of the fishing rod, unreal reel in Kendall, stryper is try pass and how many? How many can you get a day striped bass like one a day or something? One day spearfishing. One a day and and the US site Canada, you not even touch anything. You can't use spear phishing Canada because the Anglers Association in Canada, things that were the evil basically, but you're evil.

Speaker 2:          00:21:43       Why? Because you can actually see what you're catching. Yeah, so basically what cheaters, because we can see the fish and I'm like, how can you be in your camping chairs on your boat? Drinking Beers all day. Telling me that I'm the cheater when I'm working my ass off. Diving it like 60 feet to catch my fish, to bring it back. And I wrecked my life. I risked my life drowning and was my left would sharks. I risked my life with all sorts of things that can happen and you telling me drinking you, but wiser. You fricking camping chair that I'm the cheater. I'm sorry, but no.

Speaker 4:          00:22:16       Well, people always want to think that everybody else is doing it wrong. True. You know, vegans, one of the thing, people that eat meat or doing it wrong, people did eat meat. One of the things, vegans are doing it wrong. People fish off a boat. Want to think that people's spearfish, you're doing it wrong, you think they're probably doing it wrong?

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       No, I have nothing. Again, catching you on food as long as you know, respectful what would do where you do it. But there was a big scandal in Florida for the past years with the Brett snap or by example, and it was about, um, like recreational, recreational fishing. You allowed a certain amount of red snapper and the new season closes and then when the season closes as an individual, my license to fish is gone. And then he gave it away to the commercial fishermen and I'm like, whoa. So basically you telling me that I'm not allowed to catch that fish for a few months because the population is too bad, but then you given my quota to the commercial boats that are catching hundreds a day. They like, yeah. No, it doesn't make any sense. No it doesn't.

Speaker 4:          00:23:25       But most people are not going to spear fish. Most people are going to fish, so they don't. You guys don't have a voice. Right. In terms of like representative voice, some comes to creating these laws and establishing these, these rules. There's not that many of you.

Speaker 2:          00:23:42       Oh, we're ready. And the food chain, we're the. We're the plankton is, you know, you had a commercial fishing would very big lobbyists. Men, a lot of money and then you have the anglers uses a little bit. It's still not super bad because they still have big boats. Company and equipment is so like if the market, which is good enough. And anyhow, spivey, spivey, Shamans were not a lot in the world's eye. I couldn't even tell you how many, but we're not 100 million us for fricking sure.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       It's probably less spear fisherman than there are bow hunters.

Speaker 2:          00:24:14       That's highly

Speaker 1:          00:24:14       possible I would imagine because it seems more dangerous and difficult than bowhunting. Seems like the next level. It seems like one of the most difficult things you could do if you want to get your food, it's because you're going into an alien environment and you're holding your breath.

Speaker 2:          00:24:31       True. But actually the human body, that's the main argument I get from people. They tell me, Oh, I could never do it, but every year the human body is actually made to do this, so there's a thing called the Mammalian dive reflex and this is very present and aquatic mammals such as dolphins or sales and things like that, and the human habit in a very way we create way, but we still have it and so when you immerse your face on the water, your heartbeat is automatically going to slow down, especially if the water is colder, so your body's actually getting prepared to hold his breath to catch food and that's. That's a new DNA.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       Is it preparing to catch food or is it just preparing to survive

Speaker 2:          00:25:19       to hold your breath underwater? What reason? I mean, I guess I guess that was a very success of thing to say because it's I'm, I'm seeing catch food, but I just don't see why a human being genetically would have to go.

Speaker 1:          00:25:31       You're aware of the aquatic ape theory. Now it's a very controversial theory, but the theory is that we evolved somehow or another. You know, dolphins, apparently, where at one point in time a land animal is that crew, is that right? Were Dolphins Atlanta animal at one point in time?

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       I don't know if that's true. I might have made that up, but the idea was that humans were the only ape that grew up in close proximity to water to the point where we evolved in the water dolphins may have remains of legs. Yeah, okay. Fossil remains shows. Dolphins and whales were four footed land animals about 50 million years ago and share the same common ancestors is hippos. And Dear, Whoa, scientists believed that they later transitioned to an aquatic lifestyle and that their hind limbs disappeared. Okay, so this is fairly recent. If you think about evolutionary terms that the dinosaurs were killed 65 million years ago. So inside of that 15 million years later, they were walking around, which is fucking nuts. They were like hippos. They think so google doc, whoa. Look at what they used to look like. What the fuck, man? A Google aquatic ape theory. Uh, I don't know enough about this to really speak on it, but that has never stopped me in the past. But this, this, this theory is that the, one of the reasons why they think humans have so much fat on us when we're babies is that we float easier and that if you take a human baby, you chuck them in the water. Okay. Well, how about an actual article and how to picture this cartoon.

Speaker 2:          00:27:13       Oh, but it's actually, it's not, it's not even just about you hobbies slowing down. There's a bunch of things that happened and you like crazy thing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:20       Babies know how to hold their breath. They instantly hold their breath when you, that's like Nirvana album cover a million directions.

Speaker 2:          00:27:27       Yes, that's, that's exactly, that's what I'm talking about. Reports

Speaker 1:          00:27:30       that some humans, notably children under five may also use this reflex to survive. Prolong submersion. The mammalian dive reflex was developed in 19 theory was developed in 19 sixties. That explanation for well publicized survival of exceptional submersion times have some near drowning victims. But, um, see if there's anything like are an actual article that makes sense on the aquatic ape theory. There's a new aquatic ape theory from the Smithsonian. Oh, okay. Hm. Okay. Okay. The aquatic ape theory now largely dismissed, tries to explain the origins of many humankind, a unique traits popular as the 19 seventies, 19 eighties by writer Elaine Morgan. The theory suggests that early hominids lived in water at least part of the time, the aquatic life aquatic lifestyle supposedly accounts for hairless bodies, which made us more streamlined for swimming and diving are upright, two legged walking, which made waiting easier and our layers of subcutaneous fat, which made us better insulated in water.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       Think Whale blubber. The theory even links and aquatic existence to the extinction of human evolution rather of human speech. The hypothesis was met with much criticism Blahblahblahblah blom 2009. Uh, Richard Rang Ham of Harvard University and colleagues suggested in American Journal of physical anthropology that shallow aquatic habitats allowed hominids to thrive in Savannah's enabling our ancestors to move from tropical forest to open grasslands. So from two point $5 million to one point 4 million years ago, Africa became drier during certain seasons already dry. Savannah's became even more arid, making it difficult for hominids to find adequate food. But randoms team suggests that even in this inhospitable environment, there were oasises wetlands in lake shores and these aquatic habitats, water lilies, cattails, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So that's the theory. The theory is that we like, you know, obviously there's a bunch of different kinds of primates and some of them are still in trees today. Those fucking losers. We left them behind. Ha Ha. Those are the ones that really dumb people point to. If people came from monkeys wearing monkeys, well Tom, they were the dumb monkeys fro. Come on,

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       get it together. We're the ones that made cars but that, um, some, some of these apes spent a lot of time in the water. And that's why I'm, if you ever see a baby chimp, they're hard as rock. They're like they're jacked baby chimps. Like they come out like, like sinewy no body fat. And you throw them in the water, they drown. They don't hold their breath, they just, they, they don't know what to do. They just gag on water and drown. Not that I know, not that I'm throwing chips in the water, but that's what they say. But if you throw a either a baby person in the water, they hold their breath. So this is the quadrant

Speaker 2:          00:30:20       theory, but that's what. That's what scientists are basically saying about free diving in this is. This is one of the first lap. Sorry. When I first learned about it, it completely blew my mind. How long can you hold your breath now? Five and a half. Holy Shit. But like facing down on the water and not moving and doing a preparation. Not Swimming, not swimming, just facebook.

Speaker 4:          00:30:41       If you have a dive into the water and give you what, how much time do you give yourself?

Speaker 2:          00:30:46       It depends. It depends. The fish, Johann to depends on the conditions. It depends on the lot.

Speaker 4:          00:30:51       So like if you're fighting the water occurrence, it's more difficult.

Speaker 2:          00:30:55       Yes. Because basically what you want to do when you free dive is you want to be as calm as possible. You want to be as relaxed as you can, which is why yoga and meditation are often very close to free diving because if your heartbeat is is is high, then your body's going to need more oxygen. That makes sense obviously, and but then again, the second year emerge your face in the water. You do like your first dive and then you feel the pressure you body understands that you're trying to to hold your breath and you need to do that so the blood is going to start coming from, from your fingers. We extremities, your toes, and then you hand you feet, so all the, all the vessels I was going to start to construct so all the blood flow was going to go towards your vitals organs so you actually, you body is getting ready for it, so they want to make sure that the oxygen's goes exactly what needs to be. It makes sure that you need as as less effort to do anything is possible when you actually underwater.

Speaker 4:          00:31:54       Now, when you first tried holding your breath, how long did you have for

Speaker 2:          00:31:58       your first time? I did it. Yeah. I think my first time trying it, it was about a minute,

Speaker 4:          00:32:04       so that was like the best he could do. No techniques just ready to

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       no, no technique like, like they, they, you breed a little bit before. So even with techniques. Yeah, we'll techniques. It was, it's when you hold your brand, you have the ability of two in your body because you're not excelling any. And then when you body realizes that is a buildup, it gives you an urge to breathe and then it gives you construct contractions like diaphragm contractions and this is what makes somebody panicked. You know, like my buddy, you need to hear when you want to, you want to hear and then the more you train then you realized that you learn how to control it and it's not because you body tell you to breathe that you necessarily out of oxygen.

Speaker 5:          00:32:46       Hm.

Speaker 4:          00:32:47       So how, what, what techniques do you do to relax that

Speaker 2:          00:32:51       breeding? So I do mostly, especially when I'm in the water, I do a very short inhale, so about five seconds and then I do a long inhale, maybe 10 to 15 seconds. And then when you, when you exhale, you're focusing on like everything getting relaxed and then you're going to do that again because you said inhale twice. Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to know. So you inhale for five seconds and then you exhale for 10 to 15 seconds.

Speaker 4:          00:33:17       Oh, okay. So you exhale slowly.

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       You Excel super slowly. Use your tongue to control the air coming out. And then when you do that you get as relaxed as possible and then the more relaxed you are, that along with your mom will diving reflex, which is your heart beating, slow down. Naturally you blood shifting from extremities to your vital organs. And then you also have about a few years ago, maybe only 50 years ago, they taught that when you reach 30 meters, you body would be completely crushed inside. That was a scientist would think 30 meters. Yeah, something like that. That it was like that the pressure would be so great there that you body will be completely crushed. But then again would that would that dive reflex. What it does is that that overflow of blood is going around you lvl leads in your lungs, which prevent ends from crushing you. Buddies is actually a design machine to go underwater, which is completely crazy considering that. I've never knew that. Especially going up in downtown Montreal. Yeah. And then you put somebody in a water and you're like, hey, you actually may for that. So when people tell me, Oh, I could never do that. It's too hard. No, no, you, you actually born like that.

Speaker 4:          00:34:30       So was it, was it a revelation for you? I mean, did you really feel like this is more of who I am than, than the life that I was living before?

Speaker 2:          00:34:39       One hundred percent is I had this, I was living in London too, so it was all about all about, you know, earning money to buy as many things as possible to try and impress as many people as possible. And then at some point it was like, wow, I, I just, I cannot do that. Like you're not spending my entire life just seeking to buy things and press people that don't like. And then when I started spearfishing and really gave me a different perspective on life, it gave me them, it humbled me in a way that was so, so intense that it, it changed my, it changed my way of thinking completely, basically. So as I was.

Speaker 4:          00:35:23       How did it humble you? Like in what way?

Speaker 2:          00:35:25       Because I realized that

Speaker 2:          00:35:29       when we were. Let's see, when, when I'm, when I film a documentary and I'm soften men, I film a documentary called Echo and they grow in, in Cape Verde Day two years ago. Back when Negro. Yep. I go, what does that mean? Black water events in Portuguese. And then, uh, we were there for about five weeks, five or six weeks. And then the living conditions were really bad and there was no grocery stores around and we had to catch their own food. And then it was really a self sufficient type of chip. In the first week I remember, the only thing I could focus on was, oh God, this is, this is terrible that we don't have a shower. No hot water or bathroom or disgusting. I'm starving is nothing around. And then all you can think is like how you comfort is gone and after a week that's the, the, the focus change on the good things that we're seeing around us and why having nothing all of a sudden then I was like, oh, I actually now for the first time in my life can take the time to realize what's good around me and then how we were having fires with the neighbors and then how we were offering and fish.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       And we were thinking, oh, you know, if I give this guy to fish is going to eat one today and one tomorrow. But no, the inviting neighbors to share when they make sure that it was like a whole, like community sends to all of it. And I was like, wow, I've been living in London for six years. I don't even know the name of the neighbor. And it's, it's, it's, it's bad. It's just not a way of living that I want. It's not focusing in a right things. And it's, it was that, that's in that way, you know, it's realized how much of how much of an asshole we actually became. And I just didn't want to do that.

Speaker 4:          00:37:16       Well, it's a very recent way that people have been living this, this way of living in apartment buildings and the way of living in houses where we don't know our neighbors in terms of human history. It's very recent and I don't think we're designed for it.

Speaker 2:          00:37:31       I don't think so either. It's the, the human. I do believe that a human being to be happy, you need to have the sense of community, which is why, you know, when you go into subway and you see like somebody seeing everybody's laughing and you see those videos, youtube and it makes you all warm and happy inside is because that's what we were meant to be, you know, and it's women to live with other people. We meant to socialize. We meant to have this, this, this strong feeling of, of, of um, I don't know how to say that in English. I'm give, be part of something to be part of a group and people like that. And um, I do think it's a necessity for human being to be actually happy.

Speaker 4:          00:38:10       I think so too. And I think that's probably one of the reasons why so many people are so grossly unhappy and so depressed and so disconnected and they feel alienated even though they live in these giant cities. People feel extremely lonely even though there's a lot of people around me. I'm one of the weirder things about New York City, you know, our friends live in New York City and one of the things they say they love is how many people were there? It's, there's all this energy, all this energy. I'm like,

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       yeah, we're not even talking to those people. That's what's weird. It's like you're alienated in this little 1200 foot little cubicle that you live in. You know, this little, I guess 1200 foot on that small. But you know, some of them like Ari's places, like I have to ask them, I think it's tiny. It's probably like half. That's like 600 feet. I was probably like $5 million promise. Stupid expensive. Right? But the idea is that you don't know anybody around you, but you're stacked around all these people and then you go out, you're walking around these people, but you're not really talking to them and you have a few people that you're friends with maybe that you work with and you interact with them, but then you're constantly surrounded by all these other people that you don't even know. It's a very weird, weird way to live. Whereas the way you were living, the way you were describing this with these people and they're all sharing fish and they're, you know, you're. Everyone's taken care of everybody and giving some to their neighbors and sharing. And that's how people have been living forever. I think there's certain human reward systems that are built into who we are as a being, as a species that just aren't being met. And that's why I'm so fascinated by your choice to go from being a lawyer to living this. You know, very a very interesting life of spear fishing.

Speaker 2:          00:39:56       But it's also, it's, it's not always easy in the sense that I, I still haven't found a place. What I want to live, because it's the society isn't designed for this. My lifestyle is very hard to adapt with modern society. I struggle with a lot of things. I don't know. I don't know where to live. I don't know because this has a community, you can have it in small villages. So that's kind of why I've been living in, um, well that anymore. But letting them to Bahamas for a year and I got to experience. That's when everybody knows each other. Everybody talked to each other to stay there. Um, because for now I guess what I, I couldn't, I woke up and my ex boyfriend, I couldn't live there anymore, so I was his house. I was like, all right, I'm out. So that is, I, I just, I don't know, it's, I still need, you know, to survive, I suddenly, yeah, I catch a lot of my own food and my freezer's literally full to. But I, I, you still need money to live.

Speaker 1:          00:41:02       Right. And how do you make money?

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       Um, I get a few things. I'm working right now on, on a cookbook and a TV show with a Canadian company.

Speaker 1:          00:41:12       Do you make any money off your instagram page? Oh yeah. Sometimes some people do. Right? Sometimes. How do you do that? How do you make money off your instagram?

Speaker 2:          00:41:19       Like sponsors and different things like that. I just don't like being like, hey, drink my detox tea, skinny tea. I just, I just, I just don't like doing that. And the problem also is like, was it two years ago? I was a super big contract with a crew sheet company. They needed a girl to like, they need to free freediving goal and we're not that many of us. So when they hired me at about a week later, she calls me back. She's like, Oh, I'm sorry we can't hire you anymore. I'm like, what? Why? And she says, because we're partnering with WWF and our marketing, our marketing department said you raised a red flag because you spit fish for a living

Speaker 1:          00:42:02       ww f the wrestling wwe.

Speaker 2:          00:42:05       Wow. That like dependent on like the one, the one with dependent,

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       the one that made them change the name, but wwe the worldwide. Yeah, that's what it used to be. But what do you. Is that what you're saying? The wrestling pro wrestling?

Speaker 2:          00:42:18       No, no, no. The, the ECO friendly.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       Oh, dependent world. Wildlife Federation. Oh, they made them change their name. That's why they changed her name. Oh, I thought they changed the name because of a lawsuit because they had to show that they were entertainment. Let's see. Huh. So wwf owned it? I believe so. I didn't know that. I really thought that it was just because of regulations. WWF was so,

Speaker 2:          00:42:49       so basically, yeah. They said like, oh, because we really want to keep or eco friendly.

Speaker 1:          00:42:54       Meanwhile they're fucking boats filled with rows, beef, chicken and all sorts of other shifts.

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       Well, one day crossed they're allowed. I think it's about when you two miles away from the coast, you're allowed to dump your garbage and the ocean. Everything as a cruise ship we allowed to open a trap and just throw everything in the freaking ocean. Is that true? It's true. The law. It's the law and, and we do that. Of course they do that. Oh my God, that's one of them. That's one of the problem. How many the five people cruise ship, how many destroyed thing to use in glasses because they're too lazy to Washington. That's one of the problem. And then the Bahamas, you know what you know how much dredging you need to make for, for cruise ship a boat. Boats actually pass and dock somewhere. He to rip up the entire bottom of the ocean. So it's deep enough. It's a very, very detrimental, um, organization for the, for, for the ocean. And then they tell me, start to become where would you, because you catch you on food and underwater it was bad for the ocean. I'm like, what? I cashed my own food. I don't buy this disgusting farm salmon from whole food because it's gross. And Are you telling me that I'm bad? Like what? Most

Speaker 1:          00:44:08       people don't know that farm salmon, they die the fish to make it look orange. Like if you buy farm salmon and they're not dying, it would be a white meat because they're not eating what they eat. Naturally. It's bugs. Certain bugs give them or shrimp. What is it? No, it's um, Pelicans, not pelicans. One of those little fucking weird reps. the ones that people have in their lawns.

Speaker 2:          00:44:31       Salmon is not pale orange. It's dark. Omega Flamingos

Speaker 1:          00:44:35       are pink because of this. This shrimp they eat. Right. Thanks. So yeah, it literally makes them pink salmon or dark when they're wild because of their diet, their natural diet, which includes a lot of bugs I guess.

Speaker 2:          00:44:48       Yeah. They basically feed them and whatever they have. Like salmon is not supposed to be Pale orange. Dark orange, right? Yeah. Yeah. I've caught wild salmon before. It's awesome. It is really good. But sadly with all them, the water dam that he made to make electricity and that almost of like daddy killed all of them.

Speaker 1:          00:45:10       Well the killed quite a few. There was a, there's an interesting place in Seattle where you can go and watch the salmon swim up river. There's like a bridge and you go underneath the bridge and they have this setup where there's a thick glass walls. We can actually look into the ocean and wash the salmon, go up the salmon ladder. It's really fascinating, so it's crazy to watch them, but one of the guys who was there who was a guide who was explaining how when they were doing construction and doing various things and they're building Seattle, they had shut down one of the rivers and the salmon would just get to the mouth of the river where they thought they were supposed to go and fucking die and it was crazy, like millions of them died while they were trying to figure out a way to carve this path again.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       Yeah, it's very. We added dye to it. Like Rut. Yeah. I went to. Oh, and diving in the when the Salmon River and and BC and I was underwater with my gut. I could see that had like big stains of like Rut on their body. So they live like a full live in the ocean and they came to breed one last time, which I guess is a good last tours when you think about it and then it just brought to debt.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       Yeah. It's very strange. Yeah. And if you catch them too far along the process, their body's already deteriorated. Like um, you know, I know guys who have caught them and then you can save in survival situations like people eat them because you have to. But if you caught them like towards the end of their cycle, their bodies like mush again, literally shoved your fingers. You're through

Speaker 2:          00:46:39       it. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's. But you see that's what, that's what people eat. But again, you know, the Wall Street Journal than the instagram page when they promoting a recipe for shrimp are probably coming from Thailand or sound that is farm and very bad for the environment. But then they think that, I don't know. I, there's something ridiculously taboo about catching food. It's ridiculous. And people imagine, you know, how I know have been hunting has a bad reputation for four because of the blog and and things like that. But I went fishing, we deal on top of it, what a bunch of lobbyists that are finding us for deficient of same time because they want to sell those because they wanted to fish and all we are for them as something in the way and we don't buy their fish at all because

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       there's so few of you they can, they can, they can see anything that they want about us and we don't have the power to, to say something back. Right? If they shut down sports, fear, spear fishing, there were really wouldn't be much outcry. How many spear Fisher people are there. I will lose my shit but I don't do much while you make a post on instagram and a couple of people would like it. I got 5,000 likes. How many spear Fisher people are in the country? Let's, let's Google just America just started states. How many spear fit? How would you know?

Speaker 3:          00:48:09       Because do you have to. You don't have to have the license for, for the ocean, right? It depends on the state. Some states slower day. You Do, you do have to have a license in Florida. You. Oh, interesting. Well it's like, you know, $25 license and I googled that and there's a city called spearfish. South Dakota gave me the populations don't know how to find it. Um, how many active just right spear fishermen. No disrespect to the spear. Fisher ladies. We count that much in the. How many spear fishermen are there in the United States? Going back to that state or the city? It's growing really fast. Actually. It is going fast. There is like a trend now for people to catch me on food and people are starting slowly because there's so many of big people, specialist celebrities that spearfishing voicing themselves when it comes to food of saying and now people are starting to realize that hunting or spearfishing is actually not as bad.

Speaker 3:          00:49:11       It's way better, but it's just very difficult. You know, sports illustrated, there's estimated between $1,000,002 million. So in the country. Yeah, I highly doubt it. That's a lot of people. That's like almost close to one percent, right? There's 3 million people. There's 2 million, 300 million people. Rather if there's 2 million spear Fisher people close. Yeah, but that's. That doesn't make sense. That's ridiculous. That's. I mean, even if it was one half of a percent, that's crazy. So you telling me if you get a room of 200 people, one of them's going to be a spear fishermen. Get the fuck. Oh, I'm sorry. This article I just saw the very, very top is from 1954. Only 80 people alive. That makes it even worse. That's hilarious. You talk about pulling the people. You're a pro good articles from 2016. You should know if you want to take up spearfishing. Wow. By the know it all.

Speaker 5:          00:50:13       Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:50:14       That's crazy. Nineteen 54. So I'll try it again. Okay. Just give it a shot. Whatever. I mean it's a great sport is the best way. It's the best way to eat fish and seafood. Oh, I can only imagine. I love,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       I love fishing. It's really fun.

Speaker 2:          00:50:30       It can be a little stressful sometimes. I get that, but it's. Imagine if you floating, you're floating in a salt water tank and then you looking around and you try to meditate as much as you can and then you're waiting you in hunting mode. You focusing on your pray to try to get it and then you have like five grizzly bears that are circling and you try to eat your ass. Does that happen? I try to eat a fish that you. Do you ever do get approached by sharks in the Bahamas? Yeah, Bahamas. They're pretty much always there.

Speaker 1:          00:51:02       There's a guy who just got bit in Texas. He got bit by a bull shark and now he has flesh eating bacteria that's destroying his leg. Apparently this flesh eating bacteria in the water, we don't need to google that. It's pretty bad. Pretty disgusting.

Speaker 2:          00:51:18       I can pretty bad encounters with sharks. What happened? My worst one was in Tampa, actually something super easy. It was in 15 feet of water and that's actually the dangerous spearphishing is when you start getting cocky and you say like, ah, what is shallow? It's fine. We don't have to watch each other. Everybody's doing their own thing, which is really bad. Definitely never do this. I got my lesson breakdown and I was. I showed a little fish, do I clip it to the back of my gun and then this tiger shark come in and I'm like, Ooh, tiger shark. They a little bit. They can be. They're aggressive. They're not the nicest one you want to. You want to show up. And then he was a junior juvenile when it was still a good, like seven feet long, seven years, about seven feet long, but he was young and the young, the one that you don't trust the big old shirt or you know, they're wiser.

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       They know, they check you out and things like that, but the young ones had want a little bit crazy so they're going to go more towards you and they're going to go try to do like curious bites, which is mostly what happens most of the time. Which tribe bites as a curious spike and so the discharge is in front of me and he's charging me what his mouth open. So my gun, I'm, I'm poking it. I'm poking like the eyes, I'm poking the gales and booking the nose. I'm trying to poke everything is going to hurt him as much as I can and in a very strong, especially in the water. So I'm really trying to like bang his fricking gun as much as hard as I could in his face and he doesn't back down. He keeps like circling and he keeps coming in for me and at some point I'm like, okay, like something I'm going to have to shoot it, hoping that, that, you know, I'm not going to miss because if I missed and it's the only thing between me and the shark poking it with the tip.

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       Yeah. I'm just pulling in with a hip and then you roll his eyes back, which is when they are ready, they're ready to bite. And I'm like, Oh shit. I'm like, mom, I'm dying. And I'm like, okay, well whatever, you know. So I'm like, I'm like, okay, I'm going to try to aim and try to see if I can shoot it. And then my friends arrive, he's heard you screaming, what's, do you have a fish? I'm like, oh, there's a tiger shy behind you buddy. And he's like, oh crap. He was like, if my from Felix shoe, I was like a 17 year old at the time and you've never. Rarely Spear Fisher was the first time you're seeing a shark. I promised his parents I would bring him back in one piece and I'm like, okay. I'm like, don't panic. Everything is fine. How deeply water, like 15 feet of water was so shallow. So I'm like, put your back against mine and then cover your half and if you come to cold, spoke it and to shy came in a couple of times. And then, because we were too, it was like, Eh, whatever. He just left. He didn't like that, that he was out numbered. And I'm like wow. So when I was alone with the Chicago was screaming in the water and that was like calling my friends for help and uh, nobody could hear me. And then we went back to the boat.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       Freeman of the water. How far away can people hear you?

Speaker 2:          00:54:16       Not, not to, not, not to buy 10 feet, 15 feet. So it depends on the wave again in the winds and everything like that, but nobody could definitely hear me then wanting to get back on the boat. My friend, I see my friend swimming towards the boat and he screams tiger shark. I'm like, no shit, dumb ass. I'd be like screaming for your health, but it has happened an hour and then you get to the boat. Then we left and the sharper like cycling it was like, Ooh, that was really scary. But in that situation again, if I had shut the sharp too to save myself, it's. I would have got the worst publicity ever. It's, it's. I just one thing I don't understand.

Speaker 1:          00:54:56       When did that happen? Were sharks became something that are protected in the public eye? Because was it the governor of New York that killed that shark when he was a fishing somewhat with the governor. The mayor, one of those guys was a. was sport fishing caught a shark and was it the governor Cuomo, very common in the states show fishing boat. They're edible. I've had Mako shark and restaurants before, but something happened, something changed. I think it was when there was all this awareness about shark fin soup. Yeah, there it is. Andrew Cuomo. He caught 154 pound thresher shark and everybody freaked the fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:55:39       Got It. It's one, it's one. They realized that the Asians were catching millions a day to make sure you make a shark fin soup.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       Yeah. So it became, instead of it being something that was just another fish, then it became something that's protected and people with a very shallow understanding of what a shark is. We're freaking out about it. Yeah, exactly. It's the Asians ruined it for everybody else. How dare you be careful today, especially with crazy rich Asians, number one in the box office. Um, I mean it's that, that practice of chopping off the fence and throwing the sharks back is horrific, but there's, they're sustainable populations of some sharks. I mean apparently off of the coast of California,

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       near Catalina island that the channel islands, lot of sharks out there

Speaker 2:          00:56:28       and then great white. So she did populations of sharks rain out and California's very height of great whites. Yeah. Because the seal population became really high. And then because you know that the great white shark population, it takes more time to grow. Now we're at a stage where days a shit, tons of lionfish, and now there's a lot of great white do. But great whites are protected, right? Yes, yes, definitely. Tiger sharks protected. She's protected in a lot of places in Florida. I don't think you're allowed to eat. It. Depends where some marinas are very funny about it. And New York, I went fishing in New York, uh, about a couple of months ago and a guy was like cutting and Maaco and a dog and nobody was, seemed to be offended by it. What people

Speaker 4:          00:57:13       that are on the water, people that are Fisher people, they, they wouldn't be offended. It's, it's the casual person on the outside that gets offended.

Speaker 2:          00:57:22       Yeah, exactly. But again, you know, that's. What's this, what the, that's the double edged sward of, of the Internet. You know, it gave a voice to everybody the. Exactly. But it's just like, you know, they remember that gorilla thing. What was his name? Yeah. People are like, oh, this is terrible. They should have never shut the gorilla. They should have shut the mother instead. I'm like, what we're saying when a surfer gets bitten by a shy, they're like, oh, it's his followers in this territory. Like you shouldn't have like done anything today, so I can like put your mother and that cage. Would that gorilla then tell me which one you're going to shoot. My money's not. My money's on our mother's Barbara going to be in the gorilla.

Speaker 4:          00:57:57       Yeah. I wish there was another way. I mean, I don't know that they needed to shoot that girl. I don't know enough about gorilla behavior. I would like to think that the gorilla wouldn't have done anything to the baby, but I don't know anything.

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       I don't. I don't know much about the situation. It's sad, but if I have to choose

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       baby over gorilla, I'm taking the baby every time I'm going to save the baby. Some fucking human.

Speaker 2:          00:58:18       It's. Yeah, but it's. It's easy to be irrational when it comes to that, but this is

Speaker 4:          00:58:23       not you and you don't have any stake in the game. You're talking about it from the sidelines and that's people talking about sharks as people talking about bears as people talking about a lot of animals.

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       Yeah, pretty much. And this is why spear fishing hunting or is this very well, Hayden, I guess around the world,

Speaker 4:          00:58:44       have friends that run a bear hunting operation in um, Alberta shout out to John and Jen saw them this weekend in Calgary. They are, they run a bear hunting operation and would they run a hunting operation? But they spend a good amount of time bear hunting. Black bears and the black bear population up there is incredibly dense. There's so many of them. They're everywhere and they decimate the deer population. They decimate the Moose, the elk, they eat all the babies and they cannibalize each other. I mean, it's a, it's a beautiful animals. They're fascinating. They're interesting. I'm glad they're around, but they're populations need to be controlled. There's a lot of them and they're delicious.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       And the, all these things are like, they fly in the face of reason for most people. They think if you're shooting a bear that you're a trophy hunter, like someone who's shooting a rhino or something like that. Someone who's a terrible person wants to shoot something that's endangered. There's. They are as far from endangered as is humanly possible. They're not in danger by any stretch of the imagination. They live in dense forests and there's a giant number of them and you can shoot two of them up there. They, they, they encourage you to shoot two of them. They're trying to thin out the population because of the effect they have on the Angela. It's up there, but it's one of those animals that my friend Steve Rinella calls them charismatic megafauna. It's cute. Yeah, well it's, it's just we've made them into movie characters and TV show characters and people have this idea of what they are based on just this, this sort of image that gets portrayed in the public and we accept this narrative and I think that's happening right now with sharks. You know? No one wants sharks to go extinct. I think sharks are awesome. They're cool, but there are also edible like and if there's a lot of them, I've seen people catch Maaco sharks a off of the coast of California and and cut them up and make shark stakes up and eat them and it used to be normal. No one cared until. I feel like within the last decade, something happened in the last decade that people became incredibly outrage. When someone kills a shark.

Speaker 2:          01:00:49       I, I actually think that people became outraged when you kill anything,

Speaker 1:          01:00:54       but they're so hypocritical because they're killing things left and right with their pocket book. They just don't know it. They're killing things. Their credit card, they're killing things with cash. If you buy fish at the store, you're killing fish. I don't care if you like to think you're not. You are. You're supporting the fish industry. You're supporting the killing of these animals that are eating them. It's a direct connection. You're paying a supermarket, hitman go out and do the workforce

Speaker 2:          01:01:16       one, 100 percent. If you eat fish, you cannot be against phishing. If you eat meat, you cannot be against hunting.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       It's also the weirdness of it though. I went to whole foods today on before I came here to get some lunch and as I'm walking through, just because I was thinking that I was going to have this conversation with you today and I'm walking by these long aisles of ice with these fish on it and I could just point to one of those fish and go, hey, give me that thing. No connection whatsoever to where the thing came from, how it got there. I just take it and I could bring it here. I probably should have just for effect, just slap it down on the table.

Speaker 2:          01:01:53       Imagine the amount of grocery stores as a country, right? A fish display, which is completely full.

Speaker 1:          01:02:00       Well, let's just imagine in this area there's a whole foods that's about two miles up this way and then if we go down the street, there's another one that a sprouts, they have a fish section. Then we go a little bit further down. There's a Gelson's they have a big fix fish section. There's just fish all over the place, but the ocean's pretty fucking

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       far from here. I mean, do you have to drive to get to the ocean, you know, and they're not going to the ocean and pulling these fish out themselves. It's all coming from a giant commercial boat to distributes it all throughout southern California, all throughout northern California. All throughout. Then you get into the middle of the country. That's where it gets really crazy. If you're buying halibut and you're in South Dakota, where the fuck is that coming from? You know, Alaska probably. Yeah. You're not supposed to eat hell, but if you live there, I completely. He should be close. She'd be close though. I mean I'm not, I'm just kidding. Eat you got to eat. But it's, we're weird. People are weird.

Speaker 2:          01:02:59       And our connection with food, olive dos boats, you know, they have um, I mean the states is actually doing a way better job than a lot of countries, I must admit, under control of fisheries. But when, when I see laws and regulations on small little individual anglers, your spear fisherman and then I see a chocolate. I can catch everything you want. Dash just is just boils my blood to a next level.

Speaker 4:          01:03:25       Well, it's insane and in our lifetime the population has decreased radically and there's no better example than that than the Tokyo fish markets, you know, the Tokyo fish market interview, those guys and they talk about what it used to be like when they just the amount of tuna that they deal with and the amount they deal with now it says significant dip and this is within you know, 40 years. Like what is it going to be like 40 years from now? And the estimates are that it's going to be a radical decrease in the population of almost selfish.

Speaker 2:          01:03:57       Yeah, for sure. But it's, it's, that's the problem. People want to have access to everything. Now. If we were put regulations on everybody's fish, like okay look everybody, I know you want you salomon but it's going to be close of January to me. I know you want your halibut but you can't eat it this year, next year. If we would be willing to live with just. I mean I think people would survive it, that's for sure. Because I don't think people will get used to pretty much anything. But then industry awards is worth so much money that they were not willing to do that.

Speaker 4:          01:04:30       It's not just the industry is worth so much money. Is it a certain people in certain countries in particular where that is all they have? I mean there's certain people out there where they, they're dependent upon the ocean and it's bounty for their survival and if they can't sell fish and they can't buy fish. And we talked about individual Fisher people that have boats and you know, are doing it on their own small scale commercial fishermen. There's not a lot of room for error there. They're not making a ton of money.

Speaker 2:          01:04:56       Those are under problem. Don't like the small family. A commercial fishing boat. They're not the problem. I mean it's when you see, when you see those guys bring it and you know like the guy in the video earlier. Yeah, he just catching a big net is caching like quite a bit of fish. But your reality of things or ships, foreign ships rating the entire ocean would net sir like kilometers long. Like an affiliate, a net. It is a mile long. And you just catch everything. You can't annette, and then you like turtles, turtles, dolphins, sharks, everything. Yeah. And then it's not, it's not. They're picking Johnson. Finally net lives in North Carolina. Are you catching lobster and uh, and then in two that are making a problem,

Speaker 4:          01:05:44       but you'd have to have some regulations that were accepted by all these different countries too. And that'll be a real difficult thing to pull off to get these countries to accept that they're going to lose money and to do it in a timely fashion where these, these fish could actually bounce back.

Speaker 2:          01:06:01       It's not going to happen until there's nothing left that's crazy. And it's. Everybody sees it. Everybody is talking about it. But

Speaker 4:          01:06:09       when you look at the sheer size of the ocean, the idea that we could fish the ocean out is so crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:06:16       That's a lot of fish. But when you see those commercial boats and how the quantity of fish they managed to take out of the ocean, it's a lot of fish. Is there any

Speaker 4:          01:06:26       talk about doing something about this? Is there, is there anything on the table? Is there any discussion about regulating the amount of fish these gigantic boats can pull out?

Speaker 2:          01:06:36       Well again, the US is trying to to, to regulate that and they actually made efforts that, that proved to increase the amount of fish or it's good they actually working in the right direction. But the problem is that still to this day, I'm not sure exactly how much, uh, how many nautical mile you have to be, but a Russian or a Chinese foreigner traveler is allowed to fish from the coast of United States and international water to just rate everything. That is nothing he can do about it. Who's going to regulate that? The UN China is going to be like, yeah, sure buddy.

Speaker 4:          01:07:12       Yeah. I mean, look, Japan still killing whales, you know, they kill whales under the guise of, um, of science. Have you seen how they do that at the sea shepherd bus? Those guys pretending that it was for science and then they kill them, sell them. I mean, it's really fucked up. You know, there was this, the same exact problems going on in the United States in the 18 hundreds. A market hunting is what they were calling it, where they, they devastated all the wildlife in North America. The buffalo population was almost brought to extinction levels really close. Um, there's still some wild herds that exist in Mexico and there were, some of them, they exist in United States and now they brought them back. But to this day, the majority of buffalo that live in North America are all on private land. The majority of them, but at one point in time, there's millions and millions of them all throughout the country.

Speaker 4:          01:08:05       Elk there, they've only been repopulated to a small percentage of their original range. I think it's something like 30 percent. There's some animals that have thrived like white tailed deer because, um, they live primarily in farmlands and farmlands have gotten so huge that they, they were essentially like farm animals. Now. It's very strange, like when you think of white tail deer, the places where they're the most popular. No, that's actually reindeer. That's a Caribou. Yeah. Caribou are these migrating deer that live in Canada primarily and in Alaska, and they migrate for hundreds and hundreds of miles in these massive herds. They're very different and that, you know, unlike dear, you'll see them like hundreds of them moving together in one group in one line across the Tundra, but these animals that were in North America, not Alaska but north, no, not the, the lower 48. They were wiped out almost to nothing.

Speaker 4:          01:09:08       Antelope, deer, elk, Buffalo. They were almost all wiped out by market hunting because this was back when we didn't have refrigerators so people would shoot these things and bring them to market and people would go to market and buy that meat and they would bring it in on trucks. I mean, I guess they just have blocks of ice and these trains and trucks and they would bring in this meat and they killed almost everything and it's short amount of time, like less than 100 years. There was almost nothing left. And then they instituted these laws where it was illegal to sell wild game. So if you buy elk, like say in this country, if you buy elk meat, you're buying it from New Zealand, you're getting it from. It's actually enforced right now still. Yeah. Yeah. There's. There are some commercial farms. I don't know what they sell.

Speaker 4:          01:09:54       I mean, I think you can sell commercially raised deer and elk in America, but if you go to a restaurant, most of what you're getting, you're actually getting from New Zealand. Yeah, but you can't go to the woods, like say if you went to the woods and you went and shot an elk, that one up there and you tried to sell. It's illegal to sell. You can't sell that. Meat is not a a marketable product. It's something that has to. You have to have a tag for it. You have to pay for the tag and then it has to be for your own personal consumption or you can give it away to your friends, but you can't sell it. Which is much of a bad thing. It's the only way they had to eliminate market hunting was the only way to bring these populations back. And then they had a enforce these very strict conservation efforts.

Speaker 4:          01:10:34       And then here's the big one is I think it's called the Pickman Robertson App, whatever the Pickman Robertson's editors is the name of that it. What it is is it takes 10 percent of all of the proceeds from hunting supplies and gear and puts it to wildlife conservation, which is an enormous amount of money, billions and billions of dollars. So it goes to preserve habitat and wetlands goes to reintroduce species into places where they had been decimated. Like elk are now a inviolable numbers in places where they were completely extinct like in Virginia. And Tennessee has them now as well. And Kentucky I know has Hassam, Pennsylvania has them. And at one point in time there was none there, like up until just a few decades ago,

Speaker 2:          01:11:23       if it's, if, if things or actually handle and they're responsible and smart way we can. There is a way to save everything.

Speaker 4:          01:11:32       It's. The problem is, is the United States like the United States is like, it's, it's on land, it's controllable, you know, it's our, it's, it's within these boundaries of this. This one country, you know, the control is accepted when you're talking about the ocean will be really difficult to get other countries to agree to that kind of strict management that brought back wildlife in North America to do that to the ocean. But if they did do that to the ocean mean maybe everything could bounce back.

Speaker 2:          01:12:05       Let me. A few states. Florida is definitely one of them where do looking very closely to what's going on and then they have closed seasons and things like that and actually makes it really nice and big difference. But again I think the problem is not coming from that department is coming from again, like deep trawling and commercial foreign commercial fishing net. It's just a big industry things. It is

Speaker 4:          01:12:27       Florida for sport. Fishing is a giant industry. People go there every year to grouper fish and fish for tarpon and you know there's, there's a lot of fishing in Florida and it's probably a pretty significant part of their economy.

Speaker 2:          01:12:41       Yeah, I, I, I think I read somewhere that actually the number, the number of jobs in a recorder of recreational fishing was higher than in commercial fishing in estates. Wow. I believe I read that somewhere, the number of jobs. So, so the number of sacred most jobs.

Speaker 4:          01:12:58       So like selling fishing rods and lawyers and guiding

Speaker 2:          01:13:02       born butters, things like that. Exactly. That kind of makes sense. So the commercial also, I mean the biggest problem with commercial fishing is I went to um, actually went to Taiwan last last year and it was helping them, finding government and giving them a proposal and how they can change the law to make the fisheries better and ever explained it to me now. Like they have those ships and they hire people from the Philippines or from Indonesia and then they put them on a ship for six months. They take your passport and they're getting paid like nothing. Literally nothing. And all they do all day long is they catch tuna, it gets, you know, the kitchen and the kitchen for like 14 hours a day. And then that's it. And that'll bring a tuna backs and they sell it, you know, the problem is

Speaker 4:          01:13:47       people are fucking up so many different parts of the world so fast. It's hard to like go well we got to really put it all aside and concentrate on the fish.

Speaker 2:          01:13:56       No, for sure. That's again, there's a lot of money and a lot of people depending on it. But then at some point we're going to have to realize, hey, there's no fish. So it's, we're more people so we're going to have to turn herself on, on them and then. But people are going to change their ways or do anything unless he being told. Sorry, there's no more fish. How long have you been doing this now? Full time. About three years.

Speaker 1:          01:14:24       And have you noticed a difference in three years?

Speaker 2:          01:14:27       Uh, depends where. But yeah, some places definitely. There's some when I'm traveling different places what I've been. And the third time that I would, a third time before time I was coming back, I could see there was even less and less fish. They didn't mean to Terrainian is a disaster. Mediterranean, there's literally nothing left in place. What will happen, and it's again, that's another example where this has been overfished for so many years. They don't allow spearfishing there, but a commercial fishing boats is allowed to catch as many tuners they want for tuna. I mean it's pivoting easily.

Speaker 1:          01:15:00       Yeah. Anthony Bourdain did something in Italy and they. There were so little fish that they were actually throwing frozen fish into the water, like frozen octopus into the water and they wanted him to pretend to catch these frozen activists. Instead, he made a mockery of it and showed the guy throwing the frozen fish into the water, frozen octopus into the water.

Speaker 2:          01:15:23       I'm not surprised if you catch a fish in Greece. You can sell it for like 100 year old because there's no fish, no fish. There's definitely no fish, but people won't change their ways until you tell them so he can have you kenny anymore. And then I'd be like, ah, I guess I have to make an effort now.

Speaker 1:          01:15:39       Fuck. So what would be the solution? I mean, can they, is there a way to commercially raised fish that's viable? It's like they do with the cattle industry.

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       Well, I'm, I'm actually going to the Marshall Islands in October and I'm going to visit this. Um, the Marshall Islands, the Marshall Islands are those middle of the Pacific in the middle of nowhere. That's my thing. And I know it's near straight or something like that. Know it's near Papa New Guinea and that type of area. Careful the people over there. Oh that's fine. I don't have much meat and like the appetizer, but they have some going to visit a farm that is sustainable and everything.

Speaker 1:          01:16:27       It was any new Guinea people listening to that. I'm joking around. People get so outraged. Who's motherfuckers calling us all cannibals. Is that where it is? Show me where it is again, right there. Where your, where your Arrow is. Oh my God. That is ridiculous. Don't go there.

Speaker 2:          01:16:43       So they told me that I'm going to visit it. I'm going to see is you just have to be really careful because again, if they leaks into the ocean and it contaminates are fish and if some of them escaped creates problems. So it's kind of problems. Does it create. You can have a captive one. So basically it's going infect the other fish diseases or diseases is

Speaker 1:          01:17:04       the get when they're in captivity, taking it all sorts of stuff. So it's a lot like captive animals, avian flu

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       and swine.

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       Yeah, pretty much. But in. I'm fucking great. Some really bad. There was some, some stories about some really bad fish farms that are speeding damn with pig stuff and it's just, again, it's all about being, being responsible.

Speaker 4:          01:17:24       We did a podcast recently about cwd c, d chronic wasting disease is a disease that's spreading amongst a deer in this country and they think a lot of it is coming or some of it is coming from deere farms. They have these deer farms and all these animals are eating off the same food and they escape and then they spread it and then there's an incubation period and mean it exists in the wild and it exists in deer farms. So it's like. It's very complicated. But. So they have a similar

Speaker 3:          01:17:53       issue with fish then? Yeah, they do actually. And it's. It's pretty bad, but it's. What kind of diseases do they get? I wouldn't know what type of deal they have. It's just. I'm not really familiar with fish diseases to be honest, but what that term is definitely like some fish have cancer. That's it's bad. What does the term

Speaker 4:          01:18:12       zoonotic? Is that the term when it leaves and makes the jump to humans? The diseases. Are there any. Yeah, that's what like avian flu is and swine flu.

Speaker 3:          01:18:23       Oh, okay. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:18:25       Disease. It makes it jump to humans. Is there any diseases in fish that make the jump to humans

Speaker 3:          01:18:30       apart from parasites? The only thing you can take of that human can actually get. And parasites are pretty rare with ocean fish. Right. It's more common with freshwater fish farms. We can see warm sometimes, but you just discard them and then that's fine. They're not going to kill you. They're just going to take a little funky, but who you've eaten worms that came out of fish for sure. Right. Most of probably I just probably don't know it when I cut the fish raw cut a pretty small, so I make sure that it's nothing. Know you look to see the worms. Yeah, you can see them.

Speaker 4:          01:19:00       Can you get in your body to where it starts growing for a little slice?

Speaker 3:          01:19:05       Um, I'm not going to try, do you know? But uh, no. Will you cook the fish? They all dead. So that's why if you freeze it, that's what a lot of people freeze there. So she made before eating it. Yeah. To

Speaker 4:          01:19:16       do that with pigs and a lot of animals in this country too, but there's two types of tricky gnosis apparently. Maybe there's more, but there's two very specific kinds of tricky gnosis. One that if you freeze it'll die. And this is a trick, tricky gnosis that comes from an animal that's from the southwest of the United States, but then there's trick gnosis that comes from animals that's in the northern territories in Canada in particular, like bears, Alaska and that stuff. You could freeze it, it doesn't matter. It doesn't even kill it when you freeze it. So you have to cook it. It has to be cooked to 100. I think it's 160 degrees, some 147, 162 recommended temperature. You have to kill those little fuckers. Yeah. Otherwise you just. It just gets into your muscle tissue. I have some friends that caught. It's horrific. Oh, that's bad. Yeah. You like your whole body's like in because it's literally.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       They're borrowing their way into your body. I don't think you have something bad, bad and fish. I mean, maybe that's why I'm skinny. Who knows for. Well, maybe you just eating fish all the time. It's probably pretty lean stuff, but also free diving. You burn when you go spearfishing. You burn about between a thousand and I think 1300 calories an hour. Why? So? He wouldn't lose weight goals. Pivoting really 1300 calories an hour. That's incredible. It's very, very intense. Wow, that's amazing. That's what you would think. A lot of people listening to this like, oh, I could eat so much food. I'll just go free diving, but you also don't eat food, which is the Marshall Islands. Oh, Jesus starts to blow that thing up. We've shown that a million times. That's the crazy nuclear bomb testing area. That is the nuttiest shit ever. You see that as miles high water spraying up into the sky. So maybe the fish you're going to have like, oh yeah, you're going to have fish that can read your mind to get. I know you're coming.

Speaker 3:          01:21:14       What do you spear phishing for in the Marshall Islands? We're just going to be visiting a farm and yeah, so it's Kinda good. I have a lot of people asking me for or for alternatives and what it can do and what did you eat? And so this is one of the possible alternatives that they have these farms. Exactly. So I'm going to check it out and make sure that it's legit. And then is it possible that they could reintroduce fish into the ocean? Like stock the ocean because that's what they do. Some lakes, like uh, I used to go fishing at this lake in Boston and um, the restock it every year with rainbow trout. Yeah. That's actually by my leg when my parents have a good crunchy. How's it do that to you? And it works. The only problem that we see with that for like an ocean fish would be I'm thinking because they never had predators captivity, that that may be in my habits revival problem after that, but maybe they can learn it.

Speaker 3:          01:22:12       I don't know. Yeah. The strong smart survive. Right. You still better that if you know, if there's 10 thousands of survivors still good. It's better than. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder what would have to do. I wonder if it's even possible to, to restock something as big as the ocean. It's just being fished so quickly and that's, that's, that's the biggest problem. But there are solutions. It's just people have to be willing to talk about it and right now that's the biggest problem with the same situation as what the Wall Street Journal when people and trying to talk about food searching and mentioning alternative, but like they're like, we don't eat fish, we don't eat seafood. No, that's not true. And don't you think that it's the optics though? I mean what they're concerned with is not. It's not that it's rational, it's that they don't want any.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       That's what it is. So a person like you, although what you're doing is if you explain it and you look at it objectively, it's very rational, but they're not trying to be rational with they're trying to do is avoid any conflict. Like there was a guy who is a nascar driver, okay. And he lost a sponsor recently for some racist stuff that his father said 30 years ago. This is how crazy people are getting. Thirty years ago his father used a racial slur and because of that, this guy who wasn't even alive when this happened or maybe he was alive, maybe he was seven years old or some shit, he lost the sponsor. Man, it's one of the companies are such cowards, like they're so terrified because of social media, because people are so willing to protest and there's a bunch of fuck heads out there. They just get a thrill off of getting people fired and of getting things canceled and of like exercising action and seeing a result.

Speaker 1:          01:24:13       All they're doing is pushing buttons. It's not that they've thought about this and like, Hey, is this guy really responsible? Should we really blame him for something his father did 30 years ago and that's ridiculous. What we should do is nothing just let it go. I mean, unless this guy is like some sort of white supremacists are some racist himself and he's not, we should just do nothing, but that's not. That doesn't. That's not fun. What's fun is getting a rush, a power trip out of action, like clearly there should look. If you find a real racist, something, someone who's doing something actively to harm other people simply based on their ethnic origin or the color of their skin, but yeah, that's terrible. You should talk about that. That should be eliminated from our society. Real, real racism, but that's not what this is. What this is is people deciding that they're going to take action and then Nascar being a pussy about it or this company being a pussy about it and that's the same thing that's happening with you. It's not. This is not a rational decision like they should look at it and go, wow, what an interesting way to get your fish. Like how many of these people that made this decision actually eat fish? I would bet it's most. I bet it's most

Speaker 2:          01:25:26       people should understand also that by refraining people to talk about it, you being part of the problem. Yes. This is why things have been so bad for so many years because nobody wants to talk about it. They all want to eat it. They just don't want to know where it's from,

Speaker 1:          01:25:43       but no one's looking at things long term. All they're looking at potential short term income loss. So what the Wall Street Journal or the Washington Post or whatever, whatever paper it is, what they're worried about. They're worried that someone's gonna come along and say the Wall Street Journal support. Was It Wall Street Journal? The Wall Street Journal supports a

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       mass extinction of fish. They can just reframe it and some outrageous, unrealistic non the accurate way.

Speaker 3:          01:26:12       Well, people need to chill out to understand honestly. Um, when it come from

Speaker 2:          01:26:17       in a sense that especially like the millennials or whatever we all born with. You know, we had a bunch of toys with China and, and wouldn't you shit about dad? We ate whatever we won. Nobody gives a shit about that. We had fricking process food. Nobody cared about it. We had hot dogs and nobody was saying anything about it. And then we all reach like, or mid twenties and Ellison and we've been taught, but everybody, oh by the way, you know everything, like all you barbies or they're very bad environment. Oh you know what, by the way, like the hot dogs, you've been eating every bathroom environment and you like, we live in an era when being told that everything we're doing Israel and it's hard. It's hard for somebody that lives in Missoula city that doesn't know anything else to be like, oh yeah, you know, what's, what shoe, I'm going to stop eating this that I've been eating for the last 20 years just because somebody told me. So

Speaker 4:          01:27:02       somebody had a very funny tweet about starbucks, about als. You know, the Dino California eliminated straws. Yep. And starbucks had this whole thing about, you know, big sign about how we're doing our part for the environment. We're eliminating straws. And then on the, you know, the tweeted said, um, okay. So you're just putting plastic lids on your coffee cups. Yeah. And what happens with them. And then starbucks, it's an o Dot d.like

Speaker 3:          01:27:35       you got fucking fixed and shit just because you get rid of this draws. You got plastic lids everywhere you go. Those God damn starbucks lids are littered on the street. They're everywhere. But is this actually, this is a perfect example because it shows exactly this bit of action.

Speaker 2:          01:27:50       The people are like, they have either a very small action and makes them feel better or they like to point out two fingers. If somebody else you with your Straw. Exactly Straw. Now it, it's, it's this, this, just the way people are dealing with that. They've been told that everything you've been doing since Jay kids are bad. So now they're like, no, but, but,

Speaker 3:          01:28:11       but look at her. She's fishing, she's evil.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       It's just, it's just. I think it's that as soon as the way to people or handling the fact that they've been told that everything is wrong, that they're trying to be like, no, I made my effort. I made a facebook post this morning saying that I wasn't getting Straw, so I'm green.

Speaker 4:          01:28:33       California seems to be the first state to limit plastic straws. All restaurants. Wow. Yeah. Is that not as a pass, but that's the. It's been proposed governor Jerry Brown.

Speaker 3:          01:28:45       I just had. How can it be so difficult? She'd be like, look, plastic is a problem. You use something else.

Speaker 4:          01:28:53       You know, one thing that they, um, I don't know, maybe I saw this with Europe or the US fund this on your page, that there's a, a new that they use

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       for water runoff before it goes into the ocean is his giant net that catches all this plastic particles. Was that on your instagram page? Know that? It's really interesting. Someone has invented this cover that's like a, it's like a filter that as the water's going through, it catches all the stuff that would ordinarily be washed out to sea. And so it basically over these storm drainage pipes, he's enormous. Pious is this huge net so the water can still go through it, but just shows you like this insane amount of debris and garbage that would have ordinarily just been washed out to sea and the catching it in these nets. It's not everything but it's a start and it's not going to make up for the FEC and cruise ship that's dumping things just right off shore. It's crazy. I did not know that. That was the case.

Speaker 2:          01:29:50       Yeah, you, you, it's, it's legal to. And that's the worst part of it. But you spearfish, spearfish, because I'm the bad guy. So

Speaker 1:          01:30:03       would you want to do is you want to spear fish and you want to raise awareness that you want to continue to live this life. So what you're trying to do along the way is trying to figure out how to make a living while you're doing it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:15       Yeah, I do. I'm, I'm, I'm going to want to write a book. At some point

Speaker 1:          01:30:21       I might ask you how old you are. I'm 31. So this is an age where people are like, oh Jesus, you're in your thirties, should have your shit together by now. That's a lot of people think you know, it's, you're in that area were like, you should have, you should have your career in order. She's thinking about settling down, having a family. You should start your 401k and you should have all this stuff in line and you're out there fishing, stabbing fish.

Speaker 2:          01:30:46       No, I don't. I don't mind that. I don't think my, my age is an issue. It's

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       no, I don't think it's an issue either. I'm just saying that in the path from graduating high school to go into college to become an a person that's 31 years old. I mean a lot of people compare themselves in a very sort of foolish way. They compare themselves with other people, like how much stuff have these people accumulated, how much you buy.

Speaker 2:          01:31:12       But it was, for me, it was, it was a crucial step of my life to be able to take a step back. I want to take a step back of all of that and be like, okay, Whoa, whoa. Like I've been telling the same thing since I'm born about what I should want, about what I should do about, you know, about what me. Exactly. You know, it's like when I was one of his seven years old, I look at my mom and I said, you know, mom, when I grow up, I'd rather have like a job that I don't like when I make a shit ton of money, not a job. I love what I make, nothing. I was seven. I told that to my mother and my mom was like, what did I do wrong? Well, that's a rational thought with kids because then when I quit my job, then my mom was the one being like, what are you doing dad?

Speaker 2:          01:31:55       You have no security in life and blah, blah blah. And I'm like, well, sorry. It's, it's, it's good. I need, I need to step back. I need to look at everything around me. I need to look at society in each to look how things work. And I, I want to make sure that when I'm, when I'm in it, it's because I actually, I know what I want and I'm at, I don't like being told what to do. Right. So that's, that's kind of what I'm doing and figuring out my own thing and the fingernail, what's, what's important for me in what my real values are and I don't think you can discover depression. You really are by staying in your nine to five by not knowing anything and being unhappy and not being able to go outside of your comfort zone.

Speaker 4:          01:32:35       Right. Comfort zones, the big word, right? Because it's comforting that you get that check every week.

Speaker 2:          01:32:39       It is, but it's fine.

Speaker 4:          01:32:41       It's numbing.

Speaker 2:          01:32:42       You have kids, you have this and that, but it's people that tell me like, oh, I used to encourage us to have done that were, oh, I envy you life so much. And like, well, when I first quit my job, I live in my fricking car for awhile because I didn't have a place to stay and neither no money to sustain myself. Did you really live in your car? Yeah, I did for awhile. How long? Like if I like a month, something like that and what? It was like sporadic in my car. Or did you shower somewhere? No, no, I have friends so I was like, showering is also beaches, the showers and the beach, but I wasn't sure

Speaker 4:          01:33:14       when that was happening. How old were you at the time?

Speaker 2:          01:33:16       Twenty three years ago. So 20. So you're 28.

Speaker 4:          01:33:21       You were you like, what the fuck am I doing with my life? I'm living in my car.

Speaker 2:          01:33:25       Yeah, but I haven't. Yeah, but I felt I felt free and I never regret in my life. And that's okay.

Speaker 4:          01:33:30       Well you are courageous if that's the case because a lot of people would panic me included.

Speaker 2:          01:33:35       It's I guess you courageous in a way regarding the fact that you're sleeping in a car, but if he unhappy with your life, why? Why keep going with it?

Speaker 4:          01:33:47       Well, that's what you're saying is logical, right? But logic is not how most people live their lives. What you're saying is like your romantic, like you're saying, I want to live my life with passion and I want to follow my interests and I don't mind living in my car and showering at the beach. I don't mind. I'm fine with that. Most people are not fine with that. Most people would be insecure and they would be scared of the future and they would want some sort of stability and that's, that's what courageous about your, your decision because one of the things that like, um, I was talking with people about you before I did this podcast and the question from everybody's like, how does she make a living? I'm like, oh no, I'm not sure. I'm like, she, I guess she's a professional spear, Fisher person. I go, but I don't know how you make money doing that. I'm like, maybe a guide. People take people out

Speaker 2:          01:34:40       sometimes. Very rarely. I'm afraid of having a structure too. So why don't only give private lessons. I'm a freediving instructor so I don't really. I give lessons once in a while. I have contracts here in there. I'm not right now. I reached a point where I'm not, I'm not rich, but I'm not starving either. Right, and I'm, I'm, I'm kind of happy about it than I actually do believe is going to lead to some something, but lead to choose something that, to a job that I think is going to be, you know, what I'm trying to giving conferences around than I think that's, that's something that really, really interesting.

Speaker 4:          01:35:13       Conferences like this woman's empowerment thing. You were going to talk?

Speaker 2:          01:35:16       Yeah, pretty much. Just without all the shit going behind it.

Speaker 4:          01:35:20       Well that was just one and I'm sure people love a story about someone who's following their passion because there's so many people out there that really desperately want to do that. They just don't know how to do it or how to get the courage to do it or they get stuck with a mortgage or maybe they have a family and responsibilities or maybe they have loved ones that are taken care of and they can't. And so when they hear about someone who's going for it, either they're jealous of you and they hate on it, and they say that stupid, that girl's a fool, blah, blah blah. Or they go, God, I wish I could do that. Those, those are the two. Depending upon the mindset of the person that's watching you, that's going to be their reaction.

Speaker 2:          01:35:59       I completely agree. Well, I have, I had a TV show coming on, have my coo book coming on. What's the TV show? I have a TV. It's going to be in French, but it's, it's about, I'm going to be traveling around the world and fishing with. I'm not even sure I'm ready to talk about that. Um, whoops. Was a TV show is going to be fun. And I'm starting with my sister just graduated from fashion design in London and we're just starting. I'm a bathing suit company with recycled fabric. Oh, okay. So what do I have a few things that might pipeline. I'm not, I don't like being bored. I don't like. I know it seems like it. Like, oh, like I'm free spirited and I traveled around, but I'm, I'm still a very ambitious person and I do want to achieve. Things are going to make me proud. It's not always, you know, it's not. I didn't quit a bit thing to, to become a hippie and live on the beach and no, she's rest of my life. No, I just, I quit my job to live and build my life in my career the way I want it to end in a way that was making me proud and happy. So this is pretty much what I'm, what I'm, what I'm doing right now.

Speaker 4:          01:37:02       It's very admirable. It really is. It's, and it is really brave because you're not going to get a whole lot of reinforcement from other people. I'm sure you probably didn't. Probably wearing a lot of people that were telling you, you go for a girl, go sleep at the beach. Yeah, senior car. Yeah. You don't have a shower who needs a shower, you don't know where your food is coming from. Foot care,

Speaker 2:          01:37:25       but it's also the group of people were like, Oh yes, it's a good idea. And then a second you turn around and you're like, am I getting wow,

Speaker 4:          01:37:32       people love to talk shit.

Speaker 2:          01:37:34       But it's even in my hardest moments when I was broke or anything like that, I never regretted it. Not once second I told myself I made a wrong decision. So I guess it gets signed.

Speaker 4:          01:37:45       Well the good thing is you are doing something that's so soul sucking that anything seems like it's, it's, it's worth. I really

Speaker 2:          01:37:55       found myself in situations when I was like, Ooh, I'm actually an asshole. It was like, okay, I'm kind of have to work on that as a lawyer. No, even like in, in, in, in this life, you know, especially when you know, filming a documentary in Africa and different places where you know, you have no food and you're like, I have a table of people that were sharing like a can of tuna in between for people. And you're like, like, yeah, let's share. I'm happy to share. And it's just like, I just want to like push it around and digging it. It's you, you're discovering yourself and sometimes you don't always like what you see and it's. But it's, it's good, it's just, it's what it's for, you know, it's, you've looked at yourself and then I would have never discovered a type of person that I am when I'm starving, run a nine to five job unless you're starving. Right? Exactly. How many people ever are right? Not definitely not that many. And again, this was the thing that shocked me the most and I think it's also what touches people the most about Africa has been one of them is people super close with each other. People are really nice and you're really focusing on things and it's, you're like, wow, I won that. I want to keep doing that. But then you know, you spend your money there and then you spend a month in New York City and you forget everything. It takes literally a week to forget everything.

Speaker 4:          01:39:12       You know. Another hard thing would be if you tried to relay your experiences on a television show, it would be edited down to even if it's a one hour show with commercials, it becomes 44 minutes and you're just not going to be able to get all of that

Speaker 2:          01:39:30       can be very hard. I told him that I was not interested in to doing anything scripted and I told them if I want to do a TV show, if I'm puking I, I wanted there. If I'm crying, I wanted there. If I hate it, if I'm crying for my mommy to come pick me up. I wanted there to. Because I think it's. It's. That's what. That's what. That's the beauty part about those travels and that's what needs to be shown. I think

Speaker 4:          01:39:56       that would be a real reality show, but the reality of reality shows is most of them, or at least planned out if they're not scripted. Totally, and you could tell you, you can tell when people are like, well, we gotta fix this gas pump, but we're not going to get this boat started. Such bad actors you see to their face, you could smell it when they're acting. It's just like.

Speaker 2:          01:40:18       But that's what it was. The beauty of the Anthony Bourdain show actually it was all about, wouldn't

Speaker 4:          01:40:22       do that. I mean, that's why when they threw the frozen octopus in the water, he was mocking them.

Speaker 2:          01:40:28       Exactly. But it's, I mean, I understand why a lot of people see that in me. I'm a girl and sometimes a little bit girly and things like that and people were like, oh, like, oh, she wants us to be in a TV show and do this and do that. And it's, it's, I, I get why, why people would think that. But it's, it's. I mean, if you pass five minutes, you're going to be licensed.

Speaker 4:          01:40:49       What you're trying to do is relay your passion for something. And when people really, like,

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       I've struggled with that with bow hunting because I've done some things on camera. I did some, uh, a film last year for under armour. We went elk hunting. But part of me is like not everything should just be broadcast. Not Everything should be fair. Sometimes life should just be experienced, especially for someone like me who's, I think I'm overexposed in the first place. I would be better off doing less things publicly, so that's one that I've decided to do less of publicly, but part of me wants people to know that there's a satisfaction to like bow hunting in particular is very, very difficult. It's very hard to do. It takes intense practice. It takes a lot of physical exercise. You have to be able to run up the hills, you have to have endurance because you're climbing through the mountains all the time and then it's hard to do.

Speaker 1:          01:41:45       It's hard to find the animals. It's hard to get close enough to shoot one. You have to be able to execute when the moment is there. It's very difficult to shoot an animal with a bow and Arrow, especially long distance. I mean you have to have an extreme amount of proficiency before you can ever pull that off under high stress situations. So part of me wants to relay that there is a misconception about what people see when they think of hunting. They think of cruelty and they think of someone who doesn't respect nature and they think of, they think of this, um, they think of this a abusive relationship that humans have with animals instead of the way I look at it, which is you have this deep understanding of the food chain and this food chain exists. Whether you're there or not is food chain exists with bears and wolves and mount minds and deer and elk and all these animals are struggling for survival and all you do is interject.

Speaker 1:          01:42:45       You step in for a little bit and you take your part in the food chain and in and in turn you also give out all this money that goes to conservation is money that goes to conservation, ensures that this opportunity to be there for other hunters in the future and ensures that the populations of these animals will stay healthy and it ensures that they'll be monitored by the proper fishing game and wildlife biologists and all these different people that are going to ensure that these animals are this, this environment and this experience is preserved. And The wild habitat that these animals enjoy will be preserved and it's for people, it's very conflicting, you know, for people it's, it's, it seems almost hypocritical that you could say that you love these animals, but you also want to eat them.

Speaker 2:          01:43:31       Yeah. But that's, that's not what's, what's, what's, what's the hybrid thing to do is to say that you left them and then buy them for grocery store and not caring how they got there. That's when you being ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:43:44       What's the problem is that's been available for so long. We're used to it. Like if there was just a machine that you could go to where you could just get your money from this machine.

Speaker 2:          01:43:53       You talked to somebody about hunting and then they put their fingers in ears and I'm like, oh, I don't want to hear anything. And you're like, what? Well, it's the same when you go to Mcdonald's,

Speaker 1:          01:44:02       the Wall Street Journal approached you with phishing spear phishing. It's the same thing. It's not, it's not a well thought out, rational argument. They're worried about outrage. And in this day and age it's very easy. Like I, I had a picture, I put up the other day of a target that I have in my backyard with some arrows in it and all these vegans are attacking me for shooting fucking target. You know, it's crazy. I mean they know I'm practicing and I'm getting ready to shoot animals, but all they're doing is there's no animal there. It's fucking rubber to rubber elk and they're getting angry because that's what people like to do. They like to express outrage and they, they talk too much. There's too much expression. Take it from someone who does talk too much. Me, I talk way too much, but people there, they're not considering their, what they're doing. They're just doing it and you're not. You don't change people's opinion by being an asshole online. You just get everyone to realize you're an asshole.

Speaker 2:          01:44:58       Two, I've got a bunch of Vegan following me now because I took the time to respond to their concerns and now they actually got it, but how can we make improvement when when you have an one side and a bunch of people that only want to do is scream, scandal, everything they see and then in year decide the people that matters. I have a strong voice or if you care to talk about everything because they scared of that first group and then by doing that we're doing nothing. I've been toning down a lot. My instagram, I stopped posting fish with blood on it with things like that because people just don't want. I don't want to see it and I know I don't have a choice to do that because again, if you what

Speaker 1:          01:45:37       but what percentage don't want to see it. This is the thing. I mean if someone eats fish, if they'd like Sushi and then they get upset when they go to your instagram page and you've got to have a spear through a tuna you're on, you're almost. You're educating them and a lot of ways and the people that do get upset, even though you hear their voices and the voices are a loud minority. I mean you have. How many followers do you have on instagram?

Speaker 2:          01:46:05       Eighty $4,000.

Speaker 1:          01:46:07       Same thing. I think about 84,000 people looks like in a room. That's a giant number of people. Now imagine 50. Those people are screaming assholes. That's what you have. True. It's a small percentage. The number of people that see it and they're rational adults, they know that in order to kill a tuna, there's going to be some blood. There's no bloodless method for killing it tonight. It doesn't exist,

Speaker 2:          01:46:33       but also the weird thing is that in a way I understand the outrage on a certain level. Like when I went deer hunting for the first time in New Caledonia and last October and it was not. Would boast always with actual gun and when I shot the deer, so I cry. I was like, oh my God, I killed Bambi and it was so bad and I give there. It was like, oh, it was all cute and everything and like, okay, and then it was dead and then I carried it on my back and we walked back to the, to the house and then they started cutting it in pieces and it started looking like meat and my guilt when completely away, completely away. And I was like, wow, how much of a hypocrite can I be that I'm crying because I killed fricking Bambi. Like actual physical tears going down my face. And then a second I see a piece of meat. I just got excited. I'm like, we're going to be burgers elicited and it sits fish is a little bit easier because a lot of us have seen a whole fish has kids, you know, you put a whole in a table so that the Gore is a little bit less there, so it's more about the blood than seen actual fish dead. But I bet I get it. How am I know it's bad. But I, I felt really, really like in hypergrid after that.

Speaker 1:          01:47:54       I know, I know that. I mean, I felt that I felt in a weird way, I felt like a weird sense of loss the first time I shot a deer. Um, but it went away when I started eating it too. And I never killed an animal before that. But I, I had killed fish. I've been fishing since I was a little kid. I love fishing, but I didn't feel a connection with fish the same way I felt a connection with a mammal. It's because it's closer to us, you know, our closer to our species. Fish is like an alien thing that lives in an alien world, that breeze water.

Speaker 2:          01:48:27       But again, the one that had like the human, like eyes, then I tend to fill a tuna is one of them. I tend to, I have, I have a picture I have, I have to show it to you. If tuna eyes, it's you, like it's, it looks, it looks really like you can seek suppression and, and, and their eyes. That's when, that's the second way people starting to feel like, oh, I remember fear. There's, I think it's curiosity, but I guess you can say from freaking out because it knows you're going to eat it.

Speaker 1:          01:49:01       It's anthropomorphization, right? We will look at animals a week.

Speaker 2:          01:49:04       See, that's one of them just actually very. That's kind of human light.

Speaker 1:          01:49:08       Well, that fish is an asshole. I can tell looking in his eyes.

Speaker 2:          01:49:11       What is that? That's a duct to tutor. Those teeth are amazing. Yeah. That's a pretty weird fish that Jeremy. Hello folks. So it's, you know, you can see like just like a little bit wide on the outside and then just call her and freaking out because

Speaker 1:          01:49:28       it's looking out at the air for the first time. It's like, Holy Shit, it's just another world up here.

Speaker 2:          01:49:34       Gosh, actually see this.

Speaker 1:          01:49:36       Well for a second. He was right there. He's alive. She's alive. Yeah. It's probably freaking out outside the water. Like what in the fuck is this?

Speaker 2:          01:49:45       Oh, imagine if it was alive event that John My ass,

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       my, my hands would have of his gills. So if it comes back alive it. This is a very, very strong fish.

Speaker 4:          01:49:54       Imagine, look at it. It looks like a tank, but I mean imagine being a fish, you live your whole life in the water and then also in somewhat pulls you out of it and you look into the and you're like,

Speaker 3:          01:50:02       what is this and why can't I breathe? Well, at least I did it very quickly. So that's the good thing about it. Yeah. But it's got to be a freakout and push the brains like the size of your fingernail. Right? But in life is Brian Pretty quickly? What's that? Life is Brian Pretty quick. So would you do right in the dome? So you killed them and if you don't you shoot them and if you don't kill them on a spot where the gun really? Yeah. You shoot tuna with a gun. What? A spear gun? Yeah. Oh, okay. Spirits Gangsta. Lean sideways style. Shoot him right there

Speaker 4:          01:50:41       because I know they club them. They clubbed fish and they put them on boats, but I didn't know this shot him.

Speaker 3:          01:50:46       Sure you can. But you should have underwater that says how you do it. What a spear gun. You shoot them underwater. Yes. I get that. And then when you get it on land, what I do is, well, one, what's most fishermen do you grab them from the guild as, sorry, graphic content, be weird. And then you grab it, right. Given your knife it and a nice intensely. Right. If you do, if you go lion fishing or commercial fishing, what they do is they just throw it in the boat and then dies like 16 hours. And so it's, we kill it as quick as possible.

Speaker 4:          01:51:21       Yeah. And do you immediately throw them on ice? Yes. You know what? I didn't know

Speaker 3:          01:51:27       until you bleed it first. You bleed it first, you know when you eat, when you eat. I'm a Sushi or fashion. It tastes fishy. It's very often the blood that makes, that makes that taste. So every time we catch a fish you just cut the girls, you let him bleed. And then that's the same with meat. I just sat with me.

Speaker 4:          01:51:44       Yeah, they, the, the, the uh, butcher dear. They'll hang it by its legs and cut it's throat and got it. And let everything with the meat bleed out.

Speaker 3:          01:51:55       Yes. Certainly dead fish, you have to do it straightaway, almost in the water if there's not too many sharks around because the blood coagulates very, very, very quickly and then it becomes too late and then it changes the flavor of the fish. Yeah. Because when you fill it out, you cut it on the side and then when you flip it, there's just like blood everywhere and then it did painting to me and then it creates a team that it's not that good.

Speaker 4:          01:52:17       And I think that's one of the reasons why they soak fishing milk. It changes the flavor because I think if I remember this correctly, there's enzymes in milk that destroy the harmful bacteria that causes fish to taste fishy. And I think they said that this works also with meat and with chicken, that there's a certain smell to chicken in particular that when you get it, like it's might smell a little. What that is, is this certain bacteria that's on the surface of the skin and then if you soak it in milk, see if he could find that. I remember I read that like really recently.

Speaker 3:          01:52:54       Does it, it, it, uh, helps odor free cooking when you're doing fish shark even to. I tried to, yeah, that was the only time I used the sharks know you monster while I was in. I'm in lunch hook in. Um, I, I saw a guy was floating a shy and talk in Long Island Long Island yet and then um, he was filling like a small Maaco shotgun to ask him for peace and it gives me a slub of. I was like, okay, thank you. So what court with my big piece of sharp and what struck me was the smell. It smell like meat. You can, you can smell the ammonia in it. It was, it was super strong. And then I read on line and said put an milligan lemon juice for 24 hours. Did you do that? Yes I did. And a lemon juice would break it down. Was it good? Yeah, that's good. How do you cook it? I just fried in a pan.

Speaker 4:          01:53:44       Do you have a special way that you like to cook? Fish?

Speaker 3:          01:53:47       Um, it depends on which one, but I really like lightly floured and just icu it in olive oil and then I, I cook it slowly and butter and friendship with butter and everything. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:54:01       Have you become like more into cooking because you kill your own fish?

Speaker 3:          01:54:07       Opposite really? I actually, I mean opposite in a way that I always love to cook and I got into spearfishing because of cooking. So this is what made me fall in love with the sport is the fact that or the lifestyle you can call it, it's the fact that catching mountain food, I get access to two amazing fish and seafood that is, couldn't be more fresh and done.

Speaker 4:          01:54:30       There's a guy named Hank Shaw, he's been on my podcast before. He's an amazing chef and he, uh, he has a bunch of wild game, a recipe books and he got into it because he wanted the freshest ingredients and he wanted wild game ingredients as opposed to buying farm raised or factory farmed food. He wanted to be able to cook amazing dishes from like say a wild pig that he shot himself. So he got into hunting because of that and because of that it's, it's very valuable for people that are really interested in and cooking wild game because he was a legit, excellent chef before he ever got into hunting and then getting into hunting and now he writes books about it and he's very, very passionate about it. So

Speaker 3:          01:55:13       I'm an interesting. It was. It was a very similar situation to me. I literally got into it just pretty much just for the food. Actually the first two years when I thought is pivoting ain't even likes pivoting. I wasn't scared of my own shadow for two years. I didn't like it. I liked it the first time. I liked it, I liked the concept, I liked what was behind it. I fell in love with, with catching my own food and cooking after and all of that was publishing itself. It took me awhile. So you were still nervous about it? I was extremely nervous, extremely like struggling

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       to breathe and every time I was going for spear fishing trip, I couldn't sleep for a month. I was literally imagining myself being treated by a shark. And this and that. And it was, it was never. My trips never been about that even though it was completely petrified of them. I've been lost at sea, which was pretty shitty day. I might say. What happened two years ago? Um, I was in Mexico and I was with friends and I was, I was so angry. I hated the guy so badly what happened? So I jumping in the water with a friend of mine, I've never speakers before. And we're, we're in the water in there. No, no, he never did anything. He's just like, oh, I want to look around and I see what are you doing? And then I see the water. It's pretty deep and you can't see the bottom.

Speaker 2:          01:56:30       And then the boats are going further and further and further and further and further. And my friend is like, oh, what's going on? I'm like, nothing. Nothing. And I'm like, okay, we're going to start swimming from the shore right now for the shore. Yeah, for sure. So start swimming. It was like, it would have been doable. It was like maybe a good like five miles, maybe fucking shore was five. It was far. It was like I would have done it. It was definitely been after Darwin had reached the shore, so I'm trying not to panic. My heart is like pounding in my chest, in my throat. It's true thing. Wait drifting away for no reason. And some of the boat, the captain that we hired, that was American actually. What do you do to start drinking and not paying attention to you? Oh wait. And then we're stocks.

Speaker 2:          01:57:19       I told my friend Akila swimming. We swam for about an hour, an hour and a half and then a bowl passes by. So I started screaming and yelling and I had my brewery. Luckily I was swimming it and it passed next immediate wave at me like, hi. I'm like, Nah. I'm like, how do I go? Completely nuts and bolts stuff and they pick us up and I tried to explain and my completely nexus in Spanish that we've been trending at sea and it seemed like on the boat is like right there, super far away and they drop us to the boat. The guy is asking me for money. I'm like, I'm lost at sea. My wetsuit think I'm carrying. Took you to the boat is asking you for money. They got the guy that picked me up. It was asking me for money for tip, for rescuing me in the middle of the ocean.

Speaker 2:          01:58:05       I was like, sorry, I don't have to tip in my panties right now, but thank you for saving my life. And then you drop us to the boat and then we get to the boat and the guy's like, oh, I didn't put enough gas in the boat. Oops. I'm like, what? So he ran out of gas at a gas. So you were. He would never be able to get you never. Holy Shit. It was so bad. And then we managed to. The coast guard came and they tried to build a boat and he started telling the the coast guard to like, go screw himself because because I don't want to pay for this. You already Bush of assholes. I'm like, can you stop talking right now? Oh my God. And you literally insulted him so badly to Colbert left. Did they take you with them now?

Speaker 2:          01:58:49       That was the only boat with my friends ever. Drinking. No understanding what was going on. Like, what are you so mad? I'm like, just just keep drinking. So how'd you get back? And then he managed to find full reception. You call the cousin of his wife is his neighbor of this and that to come tow him. He arrived like about an hour and a half later I got back to shore and the guy's like, oh, so what time are you going tomorrow? I'm like, screw you. I'm leaving. I'm going tomorrow. What a fucking delusional. So bad. And then we get to know you almost died.

Speaker 4:          01:59:21       And I left in the ocean and I didn't have any gas and I told the coast guard to go, fuck.

Speaker 2:          01:59:26       Exactly. I never see you ever again and we get to the car and my friend is like, oh, I give him like $100 and tip. Is that enough? I'm like, you did what? You did what? Now? At Lincoln and uh, yeah. So it was. Yeah. That was the scariest thing that's ever happened to you in the water besides the tiger shark? Yeah, definitely

Speaker 4:          01:59:51       for sure it was, it. Was there anything else like that? That really freaked me out. That should freak you out. Five miles is a long way to swim, especially if you don't swim distance all the time. Did you have any flotation device or anything?

Speaker 2:          02:00:02       I have one buoy about that big and we were too. I was more scared because it was about like four, 25. So to sun was getting down really quickly. You wouldn't be able to see what the shore is now? Not by being with the lights? Yes. Could, it's more. I was more freaked about like when it's dark and it's fuck fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. So I had moments and spearfishing. That was a little bit freaky. I also had a blackout last year. So under water. Yeah, that's the biggest danger of spear phishing is actually blacking out. It's not sharks. It's not getting bitten by an underwater. Yeah. So basically what happens is that you dive down and then when you come to the surface, if you stay too long, um, you, you're on your way to the surface, going to expand bag and then your residual volume of area do you have left and you and your lungs and becomes really, really small.

Speaker 2:          02:00:53       So then the presenters becomes too low and then you pass out what becomes too low, the percentage, percentage of oxygen in your lungs become too small, and then you just pass out. So basically you brains shuts down to make sure that a lack of oxygen is not creating any permanent damages. Oh, what a Shitty CEO, Steve. It's actually kind of sport. Not enough time, but then that's what happens with people is that when it come back up, if you buddies not watching you, and that's why I spear phishing is a team sport. If they're not watching you, if you pass out on the water, what if they pass out to a sink right down. You're both doing it at the same time. Well, normally. Well the good system to dive is one person dives at a bottom. The person is watching the other one and then this one up, one down, one up, one down, and then you. You, you watch each back.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       Is that what happened with you? Yeah, it was actually very lucky. I'm the guy that was diving with me. I'm lost his brother a few years before to blackout, so he was looking at me very, very closely and I was, I was beyond grateful to see space at a surface. I knew anything was going to black out, so how'd you know you're going to black out? Because it was. I dove down and I was aiming at a fish. It was pretty deep. I was at 85 feet and I aimed for fish. It was an impulse beard. She wasn't a gun and I missed it and I started using it in water and then I miss it again. I was like, God dammit, and then I realized I was like, well, why am actually pretty deep? And I've been there for quite a while, so I started panicking a little bit so when you panic you let here even more, which is completely stupid.

Speaker 3:          02:02:24       And then I started finning, finning, finning. And then you have you started doing a fitting? Spinning. I'm finishing a when we have new wear fins kicking around. You taking. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then what happens first before you black out is you have a loss of motor control. So I could start feeling, I could feel like my body making like we're movements and then I knew that was out of oxygen and then I knew that I would probably most probably going to pass out and then I came back. I came back and the nice thought of my friend who was watching and I was like, oh, I really hope you really watching your view really watching. And he grabbed me and then he woke me up and it was. How far were you from the surface and you blacked out? I blacked out a surface at the surface.

Speaker 3:          02:03:10       Which is why it's called a shallow water blackout because even if you're in deeper water it most of the time it happens at the surface. So when you got to the surface, what did he have to do to wake you up? Or you have to take the mask off. You have to keep the head of the water and then you have to blow in the eyes because he has a high concentration of nerves. You slapped a little bit, not too hard. Call the person's name and then you normally wake up pretty, pretty fast unless you inhale water. What was it like? You are a dream like if you get choked out, like one of the things that happens when you get choked out as you wake up. It's like you were dreaming. I was at a disco.

Speaker 3:          02:03:49       I was riding my skateboard. It's weird. I've never been choked out to the point of passing out luckily for me. But yeah, I missed out on going a few, a few minutes and I just wasn't sure what was going on. And then you just, you just done for the day when it happens, but you have to be done. Huh? It's, yeah, for the, the risk of getting another one the same day. It's actually very high. Wow. So once you shut off, shut off again. So you have to wait at least the following day to get back into water the next day. I think I did, it was the day after I really want to go back in the water as soon as possible. Just jumped back on the horse. So at night I was a little bit stressed out and my friend gave me some Kratom and it was fun. That's stuff I used to think that stuff that Kratom was um,

Speaker 4:          02:04:40       I didn't think it was a drug. I thought it was a mild stimulant. I heard that people take it for pain, but I thought that when they're taking it for pain, that they're not getting high, they're just taking, it alleviates pain like advil or something like that. And then I took, I think I took eight of them, eight or 10, which is a lot because I know Chris bell takes like 10 every day. Yeah. Powder mixed with like, yeah, this is just the powder in pill form. And I was high as fuck. And I was like, oh, okay. Now I know why people are nervous about this stuff. I mean, but the weird thing is I was high but my body was very functional. Like I was high but I wasn't uncoordinated. I wasn't knocking things over. It wasn't that everything worked normal. Like everything was, was moving as I wanted it to move.

Speaker 4:          02:05:33       But I was like Whoa, I fucking tripping. It is an opiate. It operates on your opiate receptors and some sort of strange way, which is one of the reasons why they're making the argument that it should be illegal, but is if, if any opioid is legal, it should be that one because it helps people tremendously with addiction tremendously with pain. It doesn't seem to be toxic to the point where it can kill you or it's very, very rare that it does. It seems to operate in a completely different way than any other opiate and like I said, even though I was definitely high, like I was definitely under the influence of something. Nobody, I don't think anybody knew. I mean I could have conversations with people, but in the back of my head I was like, oh, hi. I'm talking to people. And it was all totally normal. I wasn't driving, but if I was driving I think I'd be fine. I'm fine. I was fine. Walk, I think even worked out. I think yeah, it's just, it's just operates in a very different way. It's um, I've never, I mean I've, I've had my knee operation, I had one of my knee operations. They gave me a morphine button, like when I was in the hospital, like they said, if you want morphine, just press that button and it'll give you some morphine. I fucking hate that guy.

Speaker 4:          02:06:51       Once he, once you get high off the morphine and you're in the hospital was great. Keep pressing the button and the pain of the knees. It was on. Um, also my knee was on this motion machine right after the, uh, the surgery was done. They put me on this machine that extends and contracts your name, brings it back and forth and that's not comfortable, but when you hit that morphine is fun. But other than that I never really have had opiates, I don't think, except they gave me a pain pill prescription. I don't remember what kind it was. It was Vicodin or percocet or one of those. I took it once and I hated it. It just made me feel really stupid. Like I just remember thinking my brain's just really dull and I still could feel the pain. I just didn't care. It was weird, you know.

Speaker 2:          02:07:37       So those morphine buttons are very dangerous. When I got my permission, I keep us in the button too. Is that, that it was really fun. I did. It told me, well, it's time to go home. And I stood up and I fell right on my face. I had a complete faceplant. Really? Yeah, like an actual complete face plant.

Speaker 4:          02:07:53       Oh, what were you in the hospital for?

Speaker 2:          02:07:55       I was a earn yum.

Speaker 4:          02:07:58       Hernia. And they didn't ask you or how many times you press that button, Valentine?

Speaker 2:          02:08:02       They did. They definitely did seem to have taking into consideration my weight.

Speaker 4:          02:08:07       Oh yeah. Right. You're trying to. Well why wouldn't they ask you how many times you press the button before they let you get up?

Speaker 2:          02:08:12       I, I don't know. But I remembered a woman being like the nerves being like, like you had, you had a lot. You show you one more, you shoot that much. If I was bringing in.

Speaker 4:          02:08:25       Well, once you're under the influence of it, imagine you don't really worry about it.

Speaker 2:          02:08:29       Nah, you know, until you pass out.

Speaker 4:          02:08:32       Well Listen Valentine. I'm glad we did this. It was really fun. I'm glad we had this conversation. I think, like I said, I think what you're trying to do with your life is admirable. Life is short. I wish more people would chase their dreams and live their lives in a way that they want to rather than just jump into the fucking rat race.

Speaker 2:          02:08:51       I'm, I'm definitely, definitely not regretting any second of it. So I'm happy I did that. Thank you so much for having me here and it's crazy how you came up. I was asking a friend of mine from podcast to listen. Then he talked to me about yours and so as I was sitting at a beach in the Bahamas, then my friend that went to law school with me, it was like, oh, you should listen to draw organ. Podcast is awesome. I look you up in instagram and I say, you will follow me. Was like,

Speaker 4:          02:09:15       Nice. There we go. My friend was like, what? Yo Shit. Well, we did it. Thanks for doing this and I hope maybe this opens up some doors for you and some things happen.

Speaker 2:          02:09:27       Well, if people start, stop hiding behind their closed mind and opinion.

Speaker 4:          02:09:32       I think so. I think slowly but surely conversations like this, it'll open doors and change people's perceptions and that's. That's what I hope people got out of it.

Speaker 2:          02:09:40       That's good. If I have one message today is talk about it, know where your food comes from and don't be. Don't be scared to see what's going on

Speaker 4:          02:09:47       and live the life to the way you want, and that's what you're doing.

Speaker 2:          02:09:51       Oh yeah. Get Out of your comfort zone because you never going to discover the person you are this thing in there.

Speaker 4:          02:09:55       Boom.
