Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Nobody knows. Oh right. We're live John Ronson, Hawaii. It fell. Hey, how are you guys for doing this man? I appreciate, I'm glad I, I couldn't tell you the number of people who've said he should do to record the number of people who set up. I've got Joe Rogan soak it about Bohemian Grove or just took it about psychopaths. You have to come on. Well I'm friends with Alex Jones and Alex Jones told me many, many, many years ago, uh, that they are burning effigies and Bohemian Grove. They're worshiping Molik the owl God, when I went to pay, he didn't grow up with Alex tone. That's a note. That's like going to Disneyland with Mickey Mouse. Yeah, it was kind of my, it was kind of my idea. I sent him to fill out the kind of sound like, I mean this isn't strictly speaking to, but I kind of sometimes feel a little bit like Alex Jones is Simon cowel because before, cause this is like way back in the mid, mid to late nineties when he was like really famous in Austin, but kind of not that well known outside.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       I was working with this producer, John Sargent. Basically we, we, we notice something which was that a lot of people on the fringes, um, that Islamic fundamentalists and Neo Nazis and militia people will have this one thing in common, which is they were all conspiracy theorists. They all believed in, you know, the evil power of Bilderberg and Bohemian Grove. Um, so I thought it'd be good to try and infiltrate those places. Um, but I didn't want to infiltrate Bohemian Grove alone because frankly I was scared. So we've met Alex Jones when he was rebuilding David Koresh's Church at Waco and he seemed kind of Gung Ho. He was rebuilding David Koresh's church. Yeah, that was the first time I met Alex Jones. I wouldn't know where Randy Weaver. Uh, I, I became friends with the wave for family, um, who are the weavers again now, Ruby Ridge, you know, white separatists. And so I've got really friendly with Randy's daughter rate.

Speaker 1:          00:01:46       And then I went with Randy to, to Waco and Alex said there was this kind of crazy bad, the Waco, and I was like, who the fuck is that? What year was this? This was about nine, probably [inaudible] 98 maybe. That's when I met him. Yeah. Yeah, I met him in 98. Ah, yeah, he was, yeah, he was amazing. I mean, I could tell it like I drove to Austin with him. Like he went to buy a new suit cause he was like, you know, giving a big talk at Waco and like, yeah, everybody in the, everybody in the clothing store was like excited because Alex Jones had walked in and started, he was like a big deal in, in the neighborhood. But, but then, um, but then I wanted somebody to sneak into Bamyan Grove with and I asked David Eick first I said, gee, could we go into but he be girl?

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       But he was like, no. That's where they transform themselves back as giant lizards. Did he tell you that for real? Yeah. He said, yeah. He said that's where they transform themselves back and teach kind of abandoned all that housing a yeah, he gets mad if you bring it up. It does eight. Yeah. Which you can't, you can't get mad man. You hear that. You, you get, Oh, you made a lot of speeches saying that people transforming the lizards. Yeah. You've got to own up to that shit. Got To hope you said those exact words. But this is going back a long time. He said words. He certainly strongly implied that he believed that, that it was at Bohemian Grove, that they transform

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       yourself. I think you're in the clear, because he gave many, many interviews where he talked about that that was a, a big, well it was kind of in the early days of the Internet would, you can get away with saying stupid shit like that and you didn't have a bunch of people on reddit that immediately could debunk your Twitter or Facebook where they just knew something that you did know. And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about? Transforming a lizard is get the fuck out of here. Dude.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       Has his big piece of evidence that the Heman Grove was where the transform house into lizards was because of this woman called Kathy O'Brien who, who said that she was a kidnap sex slave. Uh, and actually it would be like, let loose into the gardens of the White House. Uh, George Bush, Sr would like hunter. And that was like his second game. And so she wrote this book about this called, um, it was called something like the crisis of democracy. It was called the transformation of America. And she said it was at Bohemian Grove. She was a kidnap sex slave at Bohemian Grove. And that's where it all happened. And she was la and Bohemian Grove was all based around this, um, this, this river and the Russian river. And, and so, so that's where the Bohemian Grove Room is first started with, with, with Cathy O'Brien. That's hilarious. Yeah. And, um, so I thought like, it can't be true that light George Bush and Henry Kissinger or go to this club out on the Saturday night, they'll put on robes and have a mock human sacrifice in front of a giant stone owl.

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       I thought that can't be true. So I phoned up David Eick and I said, which would occur trying to come with me? And he's like, no. And then I thought, well remember that crazy that you know, that guy we met at Waco, Alex Jones, maybe we should ask him. So I called up Alex Jones and I said, the fancy trying to get into piney grove. And he was like, he was like, yeah, I've got to get a cab. Well, we'll get a hit of Cabo will get it. I will get it routed our faces as devil worshipers will confront them. Gag about they're globalists devil worshiping. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:04:58       Evil. So that was the video. He made a video about this. So you were in involved in that? Yeah, I was in this video. Okay, now I remember you. Okay. Yeah, I remember you in that. It was a long time ago. Long time. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       Um, we, so we all went, we all went to Bohemian Grove. It was me and my producer, the camera man. And then Alex and Alex, his wife Violet and, and his friend Mike. And it was like six of us. And we were like strange bedfellows. Oh, this'll be fun, Alex. And Alex was like, you know what? At one point I said to Alex that have you got like a contingency plan? Like if we managed to get in and like your, you know your uncovered, have you got a contingency plan? And Alec said yes and I said, what is it? He said, I'll say to them, don't get any closer. And I'm like that's your contingency plan. Don't get any gas like a threat. I was growing up so is he was just going to scare them? Yeah, he's going to get any closer. That's it. Don't get any closer.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       That was Alex's plan. I don't think he thinks that far ahead. Ah Shit. That's a problem. He really did put on robes and they really do have like a bundle of sticks that's supposed to represent a human being and they carried it out there and light it on fire. I saw it all with my own eyes. What do they say? That it represents a human being like, well no, what what they say is that it represents dull cal, like all the troubles in the world, all these man of wealth and power have all these troubles in the world. I've got to say it was weird. People problems for this real first world problems. Yeah. 1% are first world problems. Yeah. We use that though. We'll just have pain in the ass for two weeks a year. We'll just have so much stress. We need to burn a fake person to make you feel better.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       God you guys just, it's so hard being a billionaire kind of. How do you do it? How do you run the world? I'll tell you what was weird though. So Alex, Alex is plan and this is how we were going to get him. We were going to rent a boat and like say let along the river and then get out and in climate the mountain and it get down the other side and I get in that way. I'm, I was thinking this is that this is an ill conceived plan and I know we met this local lawyer called Rick. He was like this preppy lawyer who lived in the town, Monte Rio Occidental and record had been, and he infiltrated Bohemian Grove just because like everybody in the town wants to know what's going on in baby grove. So we met Rick to get some tips on how to break in and Alex told Rick is planned and Rick said, look, if you go in that way you're gonna get yourself killed. And Alex wrote down, I suppose my favorite, one of my favorite bits of the whole weekend, Alex wrote down on this notepad going in that way, dash killed.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       So Rick said, well, you need to do is lie. Go to Eddie Bauer and get yourself some preppy clothes and just walk up the drive. Just walk up the job. [inaudible] that's a smart move. Yeah. So Alex was like really torn because part of him, he admitted this to me afterwards. Part of him was worried that like in the wicker man, me and Rick had all these other people that we'd met with all part of this cutoff elaborate plan to Lou Alex into the forest. So like he would, oh that's so rich. It crossed his mind. So the upshot was that Alex and Mike decided to go in separately to me and Rick. Oh yeah. So he didn't trust you that much? No, he didn't trust he, I mean he didn't, they didn't have Wikipedia back then. He couldn't just Google your anything. Right. Couldn't Google me. Um, did he know of your work? Did he know who you were? Not really. I, I wasn't particularly well known back then. I wasn't really well known. Safe to say that Alex Jones

Speaker 3:          00:08:55       helped launch you. We kind of help load teacher there that night. You guys went in there and Alex gave me this on VHS tape, by the way, back in 99 or whatever the hell you guys actually made a tape out of it. Yeah. Well Alex and I did this thing. I did a special in Austin. Um, my first DVD I filmed in Austin and Alex and I dressed up as the bushes. I was George Bush junior and he was senior and we ran around the, the, the state capitol with like these Bush masks on. We, I've seen that 52 let's have a big bull horn saying that. Oh, like satanist globalist at one point in time. Definitely. But I don't know if that made it into the video, but we, he actually sang a song. There's actually a song, I don't know if we've ever played that song. It's so ridiculous. Alex Jones wrote a song about like the, the elite and it, it was on the video. It was on the video and we're all like dancing around to Alex Jones song in the, in the, it's a fucking stupid. This is 99 99 or maybe two. There it is. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:10:09       I, oh, what does he say? Look, put the headphones on. You hear what he's saying? I remember putting it back to the beginning so we could hear it. Oh, that's me doing bong hits. Are we sure as hell don't live ladies and gentlemen from the belly of the beast. Classic with the lies and disinformation. No compromise. One day closer to victory. It's Joe Rogan Baby Shit. I bought the Mass Moloch

Speaker 4:          00:10:45       and friends. So this is old. This is your same time. Know. I feel like Hayden Nip Shit. Alex, is it adjusted Molec by suggesting Bohemian Grove? Yeah, the occasion I was wearing a style project t shirt. You remember style project style project.com. Oh flow. That's Alex Jones Sagan. He wrote it all too, by the way. I ended up to do it though. Oh my God, it was so stupid. And the six, six, six of bushes head

Speaker 3:          00:11:36       I haven't met Alex said that weekend. That's the only time you've ever been in Waco. Waco first. And then I lost touch with him after that. He, he, he read can he liked me again? Actually after I wrote the manifesto go, it's like he didn't like me after I wrote my book them, which includes all this stuff about sneaking into Bohemian Grove cause he thought

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       I was too much of a debunker of Bohemian Grove. But then when I wrote the metastatic goats, he liked me again because he felt that I was like, oh, the minister it goes is kind of like a conspiracy book in a way. Yeah. So, um, how much different is it than the, should we keep going with this Bohemian Grove? Yeah. Yeah. It, there's more to say. Uh, so Alex and Mike decided to go and buy the undergrowth, like I saw them. Um, so they went in through the bushes. They wouldn't see the bushes and there was a lot of poison oak. I wouldn't be at all. It's just walked in. Yeah, man. Rick, the lawyer, this kind of preppy lawyer. Um, oh, tell me the funniest thing that I've missed out of this story was, was the night before we were going to infiltrate, um, Alex and Mike decided to practice being preppy.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       I'd said they were walking, they were walking up and down like the code or outside their Botero ribbed talking in a kind of a feminine way about microprocessors. Like, you know, I, I just nanotechnologies the future. Yeah. That's how I think Doug preppies die. Yeah. Oh, uh, so, um, and then, so then they went into the undergrowth. Amedion and Rick, the lawyer went up to drive, um, actually with, with our producer John Surgeons and, and just as Rick said, you know, we gave the security guard to cat if I ruled the world type wave. Um, we've just, just preppy and we were in act like, you know, that's what it used to say when you're used to rob things. I used to. So just act like, you know, act like you know what you're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       Yeah. We walked in and there was this bank, my memories, okay, there's this big bank of telephones. This was that before cell phones were, I guess there were cell phones, but very fewer. You have a few that was a big bank of telephones. And then there were all these camps. It was like a giant redwood forest. Um, and then there are all these little camps everywhere and all the camps. Sure enough, had weird, like almost definitely kind of Maliyah la little red light. I remember one of the campuses called like devilized or something and it was like little red eyes, you know, poking out of the, think of it, that car Halloween type type shit. And then some of the camps had like grand pianos and hot tubs and they'll all these old men, all of whom looked like, you know, Mr. Burns, um, sort of in, in La little trucks going up and down.

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       Um, and like the golf carts. Yeah. Sort of more like posh pickup trucks. Let the kind of stuff you'd get like, like a universal studio tools or something. And then we saw, and there's like all this owl stuff everywhere. Now the reason love this, some conspiracy theorists get really annoyed with what I'm about to say. Um, is that because everybody really loves the idea that like they're worshiping Molec the giant Devil Howell. But the reason why I saw as I could tell, they're all these owl sculptures everywhere is cause like, it's an owl sanctuary. Like there's little cabins with like stuffed owls in there. It's like an owl sanctuary. So, um, well wait a minute. There's, there's, it's an owl sanctuary, like they actually take care of owls or like an hour or preservation area. Like this is a place where owls nest. Oh No. Our legs. So this is, if you were worshiping an hour, God though, wouldn't that be a cool place to make your sanctuary where the owls actually nest?

Speaker 1:          00:15:15       Well, I guess so and less. You can't totally debunk it there Mr. Ross. Well that's true. An Oda wouldn't like if you're worshiping a giant owl, God wouldn't, or the regular sized. I was be like false gods. I'm, and I'm um, Baskins maybe or you know, I dunno if you have like a, a great monkey God and the monkeys lived around with a great monkey. God lived, you'd feel like they worshiped the month. I like their lip or shipped Moloch. Okay, I'm with you on that still. Nonetheless. The minions, they did this bankable may, I can tell you I have children.

Speaker 1:          00:15:52       So we were wondering about me and wreck. Um, and we saw this giant, the giant Al Right. Um, of, of everybody's life legend. Um, it's funny, I remember thinking it was stone, but then a few years later somebody else infiltrated Bohemian Grove for some magazine and said, it's not stone, it's like plaster of Paris or word or something. But, and I'm sure that right when you guys were far away from it, I remember spending like all the way up to it. So is there a security guard? Like when you walked down, there was one guy sitting in a little hut and he didn't ask anything, didn't ask anything. He just wait, like enjoy, enjoy your evening or something. And where is Bohemian grow? Yeah, what state? It's in northern California. It's, it's next to this little town called Occidental. It's like a no through roads. And then he'd go up the road.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       A north of San Francisco. Yeah, north of Napa is north of Napa. Okay. Hmm. Uh, and um, I remember seeing Alex and Mike and I was like, well, hey, it's Alex and mark. Hey, I did. They walked past and they said, keep walking. That's how it was everywhere. It's commerce at the chase is our walls everywhere else. Mike said it's how was everywhere today see out? I mean they talk a little bit what hours or what? I think at this point, Mike was convinced that every time they saw an hour and it was like, you know, it was molec relate to, she's just fucking crushed. Yeah. So, so what were you thinking at this point? You're thinking, what the fuck have I got myself into hanging out with these guys? They're going to ruin my whole investigation? Well, no, I mean I was nervous, um, because you know, um, the closer you can get those microphone, the better tools.

Speaker 1:          00:17:21       We don't have our heads hearts. So yeah, I was Kinda, I was nervous. Um, but I sort of thought it was kind of fun. I felt safe with Rick, the lawyer. I felt like nothing bad would happen to me because he looked so rich and prepping and that's like every horror movie where things go bad. You're hanging out with Rick, the lawyer. Yeah. I thought I'd be fine with Rick. The lawyer. Yeah. So then the bell rings like gets to dusk and as a rigging of the, and if all these old men like drift down to this little pond and they all sit on like grass, one side of the pond and I, and Alex and Mike are there like a few rows behind us and there's the giant owl on the other side of the pond. Um, I remember this moment was, I thought it was really weird was this old man comes up to me.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       I mean this is like nearly 20 years ago, so I don't remember like all of the details, but, but this old man came up to me and said something lie like I was way younger than everybody else there and this. And this guy says to me, is this your first time? And I said, yeah. I said, Oh, you're going to love it, a burn and burn em. And I did the sort of impression of what was about to happen in, in the, in the pageant. And there was this look of like real fucking intensity on this guy's face. And at that moment I thought to myself like there's Alex and Mike like a few rows behind me, convinced that this is like evidence that the global or liter blood drinking satanists. And then there's all these like men of wealth and power who are really fucking into it all themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:18:55       And they might be into it in a different way to the way Alex and micro into it, but they're fucking into it. And I thought, I'm the only sane person in this entire fucking redwood worked. The lawyer and Rick, me and Rick were the only same people. I wonder if for 10 has dropped off from that place, wants to invented Viagara, you know, just like rich old dudes and they couldn't get it up. It's not a lot to do your board. Yeah, it was, it was a weird way to spend your summer vacation. I didn't see any like famous people, but at one point we pass this law display cabinet. I know with the names of the guests on the, in, in the display cabinet, and I remember seeing Dick Cheney's name. Oh yeah. For sure. That's probably gets us extra hearts. Yeah. Have you ever, uh, there's a photo of, I think it's Ronald Reagan at Bohemian Grove.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       Yeah. We might pull that up Jamie. Cause it's a crazy photo. So this has been like a weird spot where these guys have gone for decades. Well since I guess since like the railroad came through San Francisco, like, like, you know, the turn of the 20th century. I think that's pretty much when it started. All the fuck started. This theater is, there's Nixon, there's ran who started this thing and look at the big redwood behind on something majestic tree. Yeah. Okay. What I, what I heard, and as I say, it's been like 20 years since I've thought about this stuff too much because once I put it in them, I kind of forgot about it. But, but, but the story I heard was the, when the railroad was coming through San Francisco, all the rich white Republicans and unlike Bilderberg, this is, have a Republican club, uh, thought, you know, fuck, there goes the neighborhood, you know, we're going to lose our elite status.

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       We need to set up a private club for ourselves. So they set up the Bohemian Club in San Francisco and then Bohemian Grove and you know, if a couple of hours north. So then this less ritual starts this, you see a man wearing later Hosan appears in like a stage cut out of the giant redwoods and he's got like leaves all over his later hose and it's like leaf covered later hose and he starts singing this like and, and the symphonies there, like the San Francisco symphony. Well there's a video of it pull, pull, pull a video of Alex Jones at Bohemian Grove because Alex, Alex was a few rows behind us and he was filming it or like with a camera that had toppled over 45 degrees. It is, it is bag and yeah, he filmed the whole thing. Yeah, he did it like on a sneak tip. Yeah, I did it. Film is early as like, like the pre show later hose and I don't know if I know Alex.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       Yeah. Alex. He felt everything and put everything out. Um, see if you can find just some dude in a row in front of a giant fucking owl. Yeah. So yes, it's toppled over sideways. Yeah. So go full screen. Maybe we'll get a better look at it. And I'm a few Rosen from yeah. So then this happens, all these men in, in robes and hoods or descend, um, infant of the giant owl that you go area. And they have this ritual where, where this puppy and Masha effigy like comes out over on the pond, um, in a Gondola and they say twitch, you know, we shall burn here tonight. A Dole care and then the voice of dog care, cause he showed up, burn me and then I go year after year. Dot thing year after year and this happy grove, we burned the um, and then they lifted up and throw in the fire and the, and the FTE goes that that makes noises.

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       Do they have like a speaker system or something? Yes, he's the speakers. And what you can't see in the videos that, that there's an orchestra a to your left a bit. Fuck knows where the guy in the lift covered later host and gone at this juncture. But he was on, he was like basically sitting on the giant redwood. He's getting sodomized by Nixon and Dick Cheney. Yeah. Ronald Reagan's coaching them. There's probably about a thousand people in that crowd, the other side of the pond. Wow. When the fireworks go off, you get like a glimpse of how many people there are. There's probably a thousand people. Wow. Now one of the requirements, like how do you get in there? You get invited. I met Harry sharer who got invited Harry Shearer from the Simpsons. He was the only person who'd been to Bohemian Grove who was willing to like talk about it to me like after we left and he said he was invited to, these were his words. He said he was invited to do the place up like the word juice. And he said he thought it was kinda ridiculous, but he agreed with my interpretation of it, which is basically that it's not evidence that the secret rulers, the world are actually,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       um, satanists who do actual human sacrifice, which is basically the way Alex was. We're spinning it, but it's this kind of weird overblown pageant. Um, what I think is really interesting, and I think this is where skull and bones comes into it, is that there is this weird proclivity amongst the elites to create these ancient ceremonies for themselves. And none of them are actually ancient. They're all only what, like a hundred years old at the most, but there do not for a reason, right? They want to create this cut and masonic ritualistic, you know, Maliyah for themselves. And I think there's a weird psychology going on there. Cause I've been new or me, we were, well, I mean I wouldn't, you wouldn't. No, I wouldn't. Yeah, I might. I would have to be really fucked up to do it, to be under the influence of a lot of different things.

Speaker 3:          00:24:39       But the, the idea behind it I guess is that you, you get closer if you're all doing this ridiculous shit together, that somehow or another through tradition or through a ritual that you, you bond, you bound him and maybe it gives you a kind of mandate to be in an elite. I sometimes wonder whether lack of skull and bones too. It's not just about bonding, but it's also about creating this kind of specialness for yourself. Right, right, right. Yeah. That gives you a sort of, you know, does it make you feel so, so insecure about the idea that you're a global elitist is ruling the world. What's the other thing about skull and bonds as well? There were saying that the part of the ritual, they do like really humiliating shit to each other and they film it so that they always have this like undecided Telogis maybe.

Speaker 3:          00:25:34       Yeah, I'm, yeah, I've heard I've heard that, but I, but I, but I don't know if that's true, but I've heard that, well young Jamie was saying the Tom Cruise might be leaving Scientology. Is there any evidence to support this star Star magazine? Well, that's about as good as it gets. The body. I'll be good. It's going. Claire has a lot of power, I think the movement, well it certainly did. I mean it exposed, it will what it all deals with. I think with this, this Bohemian Grove thing and is this sort of a cultish mindsets, these weird sort of mindsets where they engage in otherwise preposterous rituals that to the outside or like to us like we're watching this hour, God and I'll fucking bundle of sticks and burn the, this is so fucking stupid. But to those people, it represents this thing that they've all kind of agreed to do this goofy shit together and there's some weird power in that.

Speaker 3:          00:26:31       Yeah, I agree with that. It's, it's definitely there for a reason. What exists in so many different cultures. That's the weirdest part about it. It's like you go back to like the Aztecs and the Maya, like they would, they would make these human sacrifices. They would wear these crazy outfits and plumed head dresses and it was all this like, yeah, it took us more than the isis cause to, sure. Yeah. Yeah. But it's bizarre the out when people start wearing outfits and engaging in rituals, you know, that's the, that's a weird aspect of human behavior that seems to be really prevalent. It's like, it's not like an isolated incidence where there's only this, you know, like if you go to Africa and you see like a or Asia or you know, you see like these people that have those, those things that extend their neck, those little bars, those women put, they're like, God, what are they doing?

Speaker 3:          00:27:20       What's, it's very isolated. Yeah. It's only like one group of people that do it or so the women that put the plates that this surgery, women that put the plates in their lips, like what the fuck is that? It doesn't catch on. It doesn't go anywhere else. Like bizarre ritual, but it's only isolate this one very specific area, but rituals themselves, like really wacky dresses and the weird things that people do. It's, it's so common. It's almost like every culture has them on the people involved. Um, by the way, when my book them came out, the Bohemian club made a statement. I remember about my book where they say, they said something along the lines of, despite Jon Ronson's objectionable chest passing, we appreciate the fats that he's putting a less kind of sensation lists spin on what he saw then what Alex Jones does. And so they kind of appreciated the fact that I was, I was being less hysterical about it than Alex and they said, you know, it's, it's overblown, it's an overblown pageants, but it couldn't be more innocent or something along those lines.

Speaker 3:          00:28:24       That's it. To a squire. And by the way, he could definitely be more innocent. I mean, look, the Mickey Mouse parade at Disneyland is also an overblown pageant and that could not be more innocent. It's not, that's really literally as innocent as things get. Blaming Grove could be way more innocent. You're, you're burning someone like, and you're saying I burned the, and then you have screams that play out over a loudspeaker that's not innocent. That's Wacky as fuck. Like it's hard to just, just stating the facts. It would be really hard to soften that up. You know, like saying that you have an over sensationalized version of it. Like what? That's not possible. Like it's really sensational. Oh, the saying that I definitely had some chuck, this is why me and Alex fell out because I felt what we saw was bizarre enough without having to put a spin on it. What was Alex Suspense? Onyx has been, was Pratt to clay that, you know, it's possible that they were killing an actual baby. I mean, attics, I come to find out about that, but he, well he bought it a long way. Oh, how did what he, uh, at one point he said to me, yeah, we overheard these two old men. Like when we were walking down the road. I mean, it's to the, me and Alex were like,

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       you know, but he said at one point we overheard these two old man going, yeah, we're going to get him elected. And I thought like, I don't know that Alex didn't hear that, but that's a bit fucking convenience. I thought that's exactly what the thing Alex would want to hear at Bohemian Grove. Oh, knows what that conversation was about. I take something out of context like that. It could have been a total complete joke. It could have been elected to let the local shrine has, it could've been anything. And the boys house cause I mean who knows what the fuck they were talking about. Alex is one of those jumped to conclusions, confirmation bias characters that oftentimes has some really fascinating information. Uh, and as much I admired that. Alex, I mean he's a good friend, a good friend. He's an extraordinary broadcasters. Crazy. He's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:30:27       He's my friend. I'll tell you right now. He's, I was fucking mind, but he's right a lot of the time. I mean one of the best pieces of work that Alex did was nine one one the road to tyranny. And in that he exposed some stuff from news broadcast that was really shocking about the use of agent provocateurs too, which I always thought was utter horse shit. And then it turns out not only is it not horse shit, but it's standard operational procedure has been proven. Um, with this occupy Wall Street crowd. They infiltrated the occupy Wall Street group and did all kinds of crazy shit and the park, we're trying to get people to join them and arrest them. And what the agent provocateurs did during the WTO protest is they would, um, they had these peaceful protests and they would come in dressed up and like all black and they had military issue boots and they were smashing windows and breaking things.

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       And then they gave an excuse for the cops come in and close down the protest. Well, they literally set up, I know, protest zone where people couldn't go to work with WTO badges. They had a WTO badge with us aligned through it, like saying no WTO. They were literally telling them they couldn't go to work with that on cause they know protest like a fucking pin, like, which is completely against everything in this country is supposed to stand for. Right. And so these people were, um, you know, they, these agent provocateurs or working for the government and they literally came in to try to break up up a peaceful protest by turning it violent. And then they were all held up in this one house and Alex documented at all, not with his own news footage and his own reporting spin, but basically just using actual news stories and different coverages by different local news stations and showed like what the fuck actually went on.

Speaker 2:          00:32:16       These people were all released, these guys were all held up in a building somewhere and they negotiated their release. Someone did somehow and it, you know, at first I was really super skeptical because I was like, that sounds like nonsense. But then you, the more you peel away, the more you realize, oh well this is something that they've always done. It's like a standard look, if you've got a bunch of people that are protesting and they're ruining your elite, globalist fun, like the best way to do it if they're being peaceful, is to have people that pretend to be amongst them start smashing things. Then you have an excuse to come in and arrest everybody. And that's what they do, man. So he, he, he had a really fascinating video on that, showing evidence of that being used before that there's a bunch of tactics are in place places not simply as innocent as that law enforcement is set up to enforce laws and to preserve peace.

Speaker 2:          00:33:08       It's not, it's not they, they do do a bunch of creepy shit. And you know, that's, that's unfortunate. But that's when you start talking about conspiracy theory. Well that seems to be conspiracy fact, you know, it just seems to be something that's standard operational procedure when they can get away with it. What I'm hoping is that with all this wikileaks shit and all this Edward Snowden stuff and all the, the, the new details that had been revealed about the NSA and, and what we know now about security and the Internet and the cloud and it's, everything can be hacked. Everything can be compromised. I'm hoping that all goes away because I'm hoping that it's just can be way too transparent. But you know, I dunno, but Alex Jones thinks they're, what they're trying to do is get down to 500,000 people. He's got this idea in his head.

Speaker 2:          00:33:56       Yeah. 500,000 people. These really grandiose things. He says like, God, Deity think he really believes them. Do you think he's like, like he's trying to make something that's so huge that everyone's going to like Jordan's house towards him. Um, he's not a liar. Um, he, he might go further with things then I would, you know, he might not have rational conclusions. He might approach things with confirmation bias. But when you spend five hours a day on the fucking radio or whatever, he does just going over a wacky theories and selling gold, gold and bonds and dried foods, they got dried food. Keep the dried fruit and your basement. You know, after a while I think you lose your fucking mind. And if you work at a strip club, you get sick or hookers. He gets sick of working with strippers. You know, if you're, you're selling drugs all day, the last thing you want to do is take trucks.

Speaker 2:          00:34:51       I think Alex is like inundated with conspiracy. It's like he's overwhelmed. You know, you probably can't see the forest for the trees. It's just saw chaos to him. It's all everybody's in on it. It's still the global elite people are turning into reptiles left and right. Burning owls, babies whenever they can. I don't know man. I don't, I mean you'd have to ask her. I love the guy though. He's a great guy. I love hanging out with him. He's a lot of fun. We had week we got on better again, as I said, after the metastatic coats came out, cause he really, he liked that book and then he had me on his show and then like all of his listeners said I was a shale for the road or do they how Michelle too? Sometimes they say that. It depends. Depends on what I say.

Speaker 2:          00:35:34       When I was talking about chem trails, then they got really mad at me. Joe Rogan's a shale. I debunk chem trails. Didn't even debunk. I just fucking science. I mean it's like real simple science behind what happens when a jet engine passes through condensation in the atmosphere. It's like it's been, they've known about it for fucking ever this idea that they're spraying clouds. Like what the fuck? Man that they're controlling you with these clouds. But when I did this a Scifi show, we talked about it and you know I brought in aviation specialists and I talked to different scientists and I talked to a bunch of different people about it and you know what? We decided to print wa or we decided to show on the television show. Unfortunately you're doing with 44 minutes of TV for an hour. You know you've got a bunch of different commercial so it kind of you don't spend, I think to really debunk something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       You'd have to kind of like spend a long time with it and actually show people like actually get a jet up in the air and film it and show how this, this plane is actually leaving these clouds because it's passing through. Hayes wouldn't be too hard to do if you had a really good budget, but we didn't have really good budget and it wouldn't be that entertaining. And then we had to make it like short little snippets, which is like a real issue when you're dealing with any of those debunking shows is that they also have to be entertaining and they also have to fit within a format where they have to break every five minutes, whatever it is for commercials. What is that, how seven minutes or something like that. Whatever the fuck they do, you know, they're, they're constantly having commercials. So it's like you have to have these little tiny chunks of information and it's really just entertainment more than anything.

Speaker 1:          00:37:14       Say No, I don't, I don't see myself as a debunker because I think, um, yeah, what I saw it behaved been growth for instance, was, was really, it was odd. There was a kind of intensity there, which, which I believe is very different to what Alex felt was going on, but it was still odd. Yeah. Well, it's undeniably odd, right? I mean it is odd. Yeah. I, yeah, and rituals exists for a reason. And one reason is that though, I mean, I don't know for certain, but I, but I would say it's this idea, you know, you know, we love to, um, this is a bit of a non sequitur, but my most recent book is this book about public shaming codes. So you've been publicly shamed. And what I've noticed happens on Twitter, it is, is we will, we will reduce somebody to a label, will reduce somebody to the worst tweet that they ever wrote. We'll demonize them and then we'll dehumanize them because we've just destroyed somebody's and we don't want to feel bad about destroying them. So we called them like a sociopath or something. It says this, his whole life, mental trick we play on ourselves. Uh, like, um, what's it called? Cognitive dissonance. This idea that we're good people, but we've just destroyed some of the day. So how do we make sense of that? Or we just say, or without a sociopath or something. So it was all about, it's all about labeling and reducing and, and demonizing

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       and destroying people that we don't like. And it's also about having an excuse to be a real asshole re, all you have to do is find a reason why you can only share a fury on people. And it's a free shot. It's a free shot because of John Ronson says something fucked up. There's a million people that could find out about that and they don't know you at all. And so they have a free shot. They'd never met you. They're never going to meet you, meet you. They live in another part of the planet and they could just steam faking, fuck that guy. They can just start typing a bunch of shit. And it's this weird thing going on, what have you, but he's kidded themselves into believing that, you know, you can lead a good ethical life. Like I can lead a good ethical life, but some bad phrasiology in a tweet or something could be a clue to alis secret in an evil.

Speaker 3:          00:39:24       Yeah. What? You're really, really back. Yeah. And I just wonder whether there's some kind of connection between, it's about color, you know, between that and about, um, the rituals that you find at places like Bohemian Grove. And maybe the connection is that it's all about tricking yourself into believing that you can do evil shit. So like would you give yourself like a ritual it skull and bones or Bohemian Grove that makes you feel, oh, I'm separate and different and better and that gives me a mandate to rule the world. I could inflict this cottage and other people because I different to them. I'm better than them. And maybe on Twitter we do the same thing and other little ways, which is like, oh well, you know, we're better than that person because that person just just misuse their privilege. So that person just, just, you know, showed that true in an evil.

Speaker 3:          00:40:12       It's all about kind of, it's all about setting yourself apart from people so that you can behave in, in, in ways that hurt other people. And you don't have to feel bad about it. Maybe that's the connection. Well, people have a tendency to pile on. It's always been the case. That's the reason why you, you see, like when riots break out that that sort of exploits that type of pile on behavior. People will do things in large groups of chaotic moments, like large groups of chaos. Rather they would, they would never do with an individual, you know, as far as like assaulting people or I mean there's been instances where uh, gangs of people beat up and killed people and the people that were involved almost didn't feel responsible because they were one of many that stomp somebody or kick somebody or went over somebody's, this snowflake doesn't need to feel responsible for the avalanche.

Speaker 3:          00:41:08       Yeah, exactly. That's a great way of putting it. And I think diffusion of responsibility is a real issue with human beings when it comes to large numbers. Uh, anytime there's large numbers, they don't feel responsible for any repercussions are of their actions. If there was only two people in the world and to, people in the world were somehow or another invented Twitter and they were communicating with each other. And One guy, uh, you know, said something questionable and the, the other guy quoted him and said, John Ronson is a piece of shit. Here is proof. You know, fuck this guy. Let's shame him. What's this? Let's is only you does it, you know, there's no one there. But what you're trying to do is they're appealing to the bully instinct of people to just pile on. And I'm torn because sometimes I think publicly shaming people is a good thing.

Speaker 3:          00:41:58       Like if it's actual social justice to rights and wrongs. But the problem is, I think these days we're in this really bad situation where people have decided to not differentiate between a serious transgression and an unserious challenge points. And some nice liberal person who tells a joke that comes out badly, is treated with a similar level of ferocity. It's like a racist cop from the McKinney Texas video. Well, most the, that's a very good way of putting it. I think most people are not living life, even they're going through life with a deficit and they started out with is devastated by having a bunch of fucking shitty experiences when they were children. They're shitty parents and bad time in school and maybe they'd been picked on and maybe their job socks or maybe they have unfulfilled sexual expectations. Whatever the fuck it is. Most people are going into any situation with a, a headwind or a tailwind, I guess it is when someone, something behind you, Pale ones, right?

Speaker 3:          00:43:00       Tailwind, the headwind is your drive. There's push behind them, but they're like accelerates their reaction to anything and they're almost looking for something that they can blame their bad feeling on it. Almost looking for a target to unleash all there an existential angst and frustration and life. All their unfulfilled expectations. All of it is on John Ronson. Shitty tweet, you know, and I wish he stopped and easy to direct. I'm sorry, I'll just fuck someone else. Um, but I've experienced it before. I have experienced, but I've, I found it adorable. I would retweet people and stuff when they did it to me. But what I always liked to, I noticed cause after my public shaming book came out, obviously you know a lot, there was a lot of pushback and a lot of people went for me and I always really liked it when people went from me in a kind of a ridiculous way cause that could retweet that one.

Speaker 3:          00:43:51       It would make me look good. I know it was one of my favorite one was um, all these people started like going for me and one person wrote why and I wasn't, I just stayed completely silent. And one person wrote why some John and applying to any of us and somebody else wrote because John Watson under applies to men and I'm not, fuck does that mean, yeah, honestly like I'm like, I'm so upset at you for ah, um, s wow, okay. Well in that particular instance, um, it all started with Justine sacco. I wrote, there's a chapter in my book that's defends Justine Sacco, who's the AIDS tweet woman. Remember on the plane, listen man, that lady is probably on Xanax and wine and she said something that she thought was funny. That would be funny if she was your friend. I like to be funny if she, well she was my friend and she told me she sent that to me in a text message.

Speaker 3:          00:44:46       I would fucking laugh. Yeah. You know, I'm going to Africa, hope I don't get aids. Lol. Just kidding. I'm white. Yeah. And then the worst thing it, then she gets on the plane. Yeah. She gets on the plane, turns off her phone while she's asleep is like just tailored to shreds by like 16 hours, hundreds of thousands of people. And one of the most extraordinary things about it is that her inability to explain herself became part of the hilarity. That was, that was the tailwind. Like, oh my God, we know something. She doesn't. One person tweeted, we're about to watch this Justine sacco bitch get fired in real time before she even knows she's being fired. And I just kinda think of anything more unjust than that. So, so I wrote this really passionate, you know, polemic defending her. I think that, you know, we had gone crazy, we'd lost our minds and they said it was the most in judicial thing you could possibly think of.

Speaker 3:          00:45:41       And a lot of people, if you can imagine kind of really objected to that. So of course, cause they have the green light to object. I mean it's not that you're not saying something reasonable. I thought it was one of the most important stores I ever did because like for, for 30 years I've been writing about abuses of power. Like in the psychopath test, they're pieces of power in the pharmaceutical industry or, or you know, the worst excesses of psychiatry or psychopaths. So whatever, whatever, the people abusing their power over there. And whenever I like gave talks about that, I'd like to, whom we'd love her, you know, people would love it. And then I write this new story, this new book where I say, you know what? The people are abusing our power now that they're us. It's like we've suddenly got all this new power of Twitter and social media and we're massively abusing it.

Speaker 3:          00:46:26       And the pushback is ferocious because the pushback is from the very people who enjoyed abusing his power. Yeah. Yeah. I have been talking about this for a while and I think that what's going on now with with people and the Internet and this, this new found ability to communicate that we find ourselves in this new found situation we find ourselves in where anyone instantaneously can comment on virtually anything that happens in the world. And if what you say resonates or offense, it can become a hot button and it just like gets all these ants just find the sugar and they just dive on it and they just swarm and it's almost like a mindless thing because I think that what we're experience is an adolescent stage of a new level of communication that human beings are experiencing. Yeah. I think that this new level of communication is starting off with the ability to just tweet at each other and it's going to eventually go into some weird virtual reality place that's and lets people filet, you know my friend Colleen? Yeah. A couple of years ago, my friend Adam Curtis, cause actually flip phones and live in the desert. Well, cut your own woods in the, basically

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       I found out from curse, he said to me, uh, who you'd love by the way, if you don't know his stuff, he knows, Oh God, you'd love him. He made, um, the power of nightmares and the century of the southeast great doc, BBC. Dot. Yeah. And we, Adam said to me one time that, you know, he thinks that the internet or definitely social media is going to be like one of those John Carpenter movies from the 80s where everybody's yelling at each other and everyone's like killing each other and eventually everyone flees to somewhere safer like the suburbs. And maybe that's because I do, you know, I noticed myself feeling a bit from social media. So we're talking about,

Speaker 2:          00:48:06       yeah, I, I never, I, I when a long time ago, maybe 10 years ago or so, um, I would argue with people online all the time. And then I realized what an enormous waste of time and is also, I realized that I'm not picking the people that I communicate with as opposed to the way you do it in real life. And one of the things that I would do in real life is I would avoid anybody that starts arguments in a shitty all the time. People were insulting and Shitty. I would argue, I wouldn't argue with them, I would avoid them. But on the Internet I would like engage these people, you know, and like I'll get you, yeah you fucking loser, you know? But you realize after a while like, oh, this is a new thing and I'm applying to it. Like the sort of same strategy that I would apply to a heckler at a comedy club and you really can't, like this is it, this is a totally new thing and no one knows how to do it yet is we, we, we, we don't have the benefit of hindsight to be able to step in.

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       And you know, we're talking like 2000 2001 we didn't have the benefit of stepping back and saying, well this has been going on for a long time and now we understand how to, how to deal with people. But back then we didn't and I wasted a lot of time, had some fun but wasted a lot of time. And also you, you get emotionally charged up and invested in these people that in real life you probably wouldn't want to hang out with them pulling up the amaze folks to be with.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       They are. And, and just the Internet is turning us into, you know, he's an empathetic psychopathic figures. I mean, you know, maybe from that and the new life that beast, that'd be sweet.

Speaker 2:          00:49:35       Well you wouldn't know them first of all based on their tweets because a tweet is one of the worst representations of you. Yeah, it's good. It has to be kind of extreme hundred and 40 characters. I mean, sometimes it can be poignant. Sometimes he can be funny, but like to sum you up from first of all, to sum you up by your writing is difficult enough as it is when you're writing chapters in paragraphs without any back and forth. It's hard because I don't think we are just who we are as an individual. I think we, we are, we are who we are based on who we're interacting with and how that works out. Like that's who you really are. That's one of the things that's so important about choosing your friends because your friends aren't just someone you enjoy that kind of help define you.

Speaker 2:          00:50:21       And when you have a bunch of really good friends and you, you communicate with them well and get a lot out of it, it changes who you are. You become a better person. You can give, become a better person, a really good relationship and you can become an awful person in a bad relationship. You know, I've been in bad relationships before. I didn't like me. I'm like, this person hates me. I don't even like me anymore. Like what? What the fuck is going on? And it's because we're, we, we like to think of ourselves as completely autonomous, but I don't think that's real. I don't think there's anybody that's really autonomous. I think we all need human beings and we all, we all cherish human interaction. As much as you want privacy, you don't want it all the time. I mean, if you had to choose between no privacy or no people, I would take no privacy. Every time I like people, the people are great, you know, I don't want to be bothered all the time and that's when people will think the woods seem like a great idea. I'm just going to go unibomber and just fucking live in the woods. But no, you don't. You don't want to do that. Like we, we literally are a super organism. We are not like one individual experiencing the universe solely on our own where we are all constantly interacting with each other.

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       Yeah. Which I think is part of the reason by social, by social media, public shaming is so fucking traumatizing to somebody on the receiving end is nothing, you know, to be a to B, two B ejected from society to be told you not as good as everybody else does get out is like deeply traumatizing. But then the people doing the shaming, they don't want to think that. They don't really think that they've just, um, potentially done something intensely traumatizing to another human being that mangled up somebodies mental health. So they just think, oh, I'm sure they're fine. You know, I'm sure that fire, that person who just showed up. Sure, they're fine. Um, um, you know, there's a guy, uh, please dyadic Gorka who reviewed my book in one of the papers who basically said, oh, John Watson. So sweet. You know, it's fine. You know, if you, if you're a man being publicly shamed, it's fine.

Speaker 1:          00:52:29       It's no big deal. They're just fine. And then I was looking at this as thinking, fucking hell. You know, I've, I've gone around the world, meet these people. They're not, they are not fucking fine. Is that whether you want to carry on doing it or not, you have to accept they are not fine. You know, people, well, a few weeks after that guy wrote that review some guy in Israel who had been falsely accused of being racist, uh, committed suicide. Uh, you know, they're not fine. It's that you can carry on doing it if you want, but it's a really severe fucking punishment.

Speaker 2:          00:53:02       Well, this mob mentality has existed throughout history. I mean, when you go back to, uh, the punishing of the witches in Salem or would they do in Africa, have you ever seen the, these, these witchcraft accusation things in Africa where one person will tell someone that someone's a witch and then everybody else in the tribe believes it and they're burning people. This is really disturbing

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       videos, but it's like this pile on where I think part of what's going on is, is a real fear of that same thing could happen to them. And so they lash out that one person like with, with real commitment so that they're inextricably a part of the group. They're in that group. They're safe for that day because we can only handle destroying one person. And I notice with just 10 soccer, one person that night tweeted, somebody's HIV positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out if her skin color protects her from aids. And you know how many people went after that person? No one is like we would to, everyone was too excited about destroyed. Just stayed to simultaneously destroy somebody who was at appropriately destroyed. Just aids it up. Has it got a fucking total free pass that night. I imagine the mindset of someone to think that the best way to respond to someone's inappropriate joke is to rape them and give them an incurable deadly disease.

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       I just in, I let feel totally justified doing it. I'm Justine was asleep out of fucking play. I everyone and everyone knew that and that's why everyone loved it so much. Well didn't she write a bunch of other ridiculous tweets like that was what she was trying to be. Twitter? Yeah. I mean it was a few. I had that one was I had a sex dream about an autistic kid last night. I didn't know it was something about, you know, it's just stupid shit. Um, I bet she's fun to drink with. Yeah. When I had a couple of drinks so she wasn't fun the first time cause she was so fucking crushed. It just a couple of weeks late, probably took years off of her life. Oh Jesus. Poor GST. Um, the second time, was she okay. Better the second time and it took her a year. It was a year. She was basically recover.

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       Yeah. She was basically fucked and in the wilderness for a year, you know, a notice actually after my book came out, one of the pushbacks was like, well, you know, just in soccer is fine now. You know, she was only like unemployed on, you know, deeply traumatized for a year. And I'm like, for one fucking joke that [inaudible] a year, you know. Oh my God. Yeah. Well that joke was representative of the hardest part. Yeah. Is that this is what we fucking do. And it's such a lie. It's like we're all these fucking Miss Marples, all these amateur sleuths I'd social media thinking that we can spot somebody true inner evil to a little bit of phrasiology. That's what happened to Trevor Noah. And it just happens over and over and uh, and it's actually Amy Schumer and it just happens over and over and over again with Amy Schumer and Trevor Noah though their standups, and especially Amy. Amy doesn't give a fuck. Like you can't, that she gives a bit more of a fuck then I just think everybody who's at the receiving end of that, it does, but it gives her an out, first of all, she doesn't ever say anything that is indefensible because she's very smart. And also I think as a comic, everything that she says, that's ridiculous. Um, if you want to debate her on like,

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       why are not, I mean she plays the role of a dumb person saying ridiculous shit all the time. Like that's part of like a persona that she'll adopt and abandoned on stage. She'll adopt it and abandoned and you know, going in, that's what she's doing. It's a part of being entertaining. It's like, you know, a Richard Pryor doing the dopey white guy voice. Do I think he's really Adobe white guy now when he's like, hey my mom, she's a great old Gal. No, he's doing the fucking character of a, a dopey person. It's easy to mock this. The same thing that Amy does when she's, she might not change her voice, but when she says ridiculous shit, she's, she's clearly being a comic and doing it as an art form. Right. You know, so

Speaker 1:          00:57:07       she can move through a few times on your podcast by the way. And, and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:57:11       that in a little while. Right. But she's been, she's got her show. I haven't talked to her forever. She's busy as fuck. She's got that movie coming out. But, uh, she's very smart. She's very smart. And so she would welcome any opportunity to defend anything like that. She doesn't take herself like ridiculously seriously or anything like that. She's very smart girl. But I fitness as a really woman wouldn't want her calling me a boy.

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       I think it's, there's like a serious change going on in the way that human beings act towards you. So do you like it? No, I think it's really bad. It's stressful. Who would have thought? The public shaming part? Yeah. I mean what I do like is the fact that there's a leveling of the playing field and social justice is, you know, obviously that side of things I really liked. But, but the problem is, you know, is that the, I think the problem I tell you it is like I would call it in London, in the ATS, and sometimes I feel with social media and with the social justice movement, it's like the worst fucker who used to hang around. The student union now gets to decide everything. And it's partly because of like the hundred and 40 character Twitter thing. So basically, you know, in the student union in the 1980s we all cared about social justice, but it's like the most unforgiving extreme fucker is now the one who's actually setting the agenda and not only setting the agenda on social media, but because the mainstream media is so enthralled to social media and doesn't want to get hurt.

Speaker 1:          00:58:39       So it goes along with it. It's kind of critic, an entire society of, of, of a surveillance society and

Speaker 2:          00:58:45       colleges are where people first start exercising that muscle and it's the most rabid version of this issue today. It's one of the reasons why a lot of Comedians won't perform in colleges anymore. Jerry Seinfeld just got a hard time from a bunch of people because he said that colleges are too politically correct and Chris rock has seen the same thing. And I stopped doing colleges a long fucking time ago for the very same reason. Yeah, well I did a college once and this is a perfect example of it, but this is a guy, this, this example is perfect because this is before the Internet. Um, and this was a guy that I actually talked to face to face. Like someone said, uh, you know, like I would do colleges and I'd fly into these towns and you know, their board. So like I'd tell my jokes and then sometimes I do look Q and a with them.

Speaker 2:          00:59:31       You know, just for fun cause it's a fun way to like you, you'll let the kids get to ask questions and you get to fuck around and come up with things on the fly. And uh, some, some guy said, do you know any joke jokes or something along those lines? Right. And I said, I don't remember anyone. I go out car. I remember this one, two Jews walk into a bar, they buy it. Like it's the end of the joke. It's stupid. It's terrible. That joke. A guy came up to me after the show and said, that joke do you did about juices. Very offensive. I said, what's offensive about it that Jews are successful at business? What's offensive that I use the word Jew to Jews walk into a bar. They went to a bar. What parts offensive? Or are you just looking to be offended or you actually offended?

Speaker 2:          01:00:15       And he was flabbergasted. He didn't know what to say because he was a fucking 19 year old kid and he thought he had his, he was an awkward socially awkward person and he thought this is my opportunity to be right. And he just, Oh, I'm offended. Like, and there's all these kids supporting each other. Yes, you do have the right to be offended and they're all fucking dumbest shit and they don't have any life experience. And they really, they don't have a nuanced view of the world yet. And they're exercising this new muscle, this new muscle of learning how to call someone on their bullshit, man on the patriarchy, on the CIS, cis gendered male, Hetero normative bullshit that you see every day. And they're, they're like finding this, this opportunity to express his rates. And then eventually, hopefully they'll settle in and hopefully they'll sort of like, as time goes on, they have more experience.

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       They'll sort of realize how ridiculous they were, you know, when they were younger. But it's like a natural inclination to like, you know, you fucked up and you know you've done wrong things. So when you see it in other people call it. So this one kid that said this to me, I mean, that was the extent of our conversation. I said, that's ridiculous. Like what's not offensive? I go, I'm, first of all, I don't tell I'm not racist. And if I told a racist joke, he'd have to be a really good, you know, and then, and he goes, we should never tell racist jokes. Like, oh, that's not true. I go, if you, if you make me laugh with a really funny racist joke, I'm thankful because you made me laugh. I don't think you think that everything you say is a fucking sworn statement, an affidavit that you're getting giving in court.

Speaker 2:          01:01:45       I assume that when you're doing the art of standup comedy, you're going to say things you don't really mean because they're funnier than what you really mean. And that's part of the art form. Just like when you listen to a song, you know, Bob Marley didn't really shoot the sheriff. Okay. Probably didn't shoot anybody. And it's like, it's, it's, it's part of the art. It's making shit up. And when you take that away because people are going to be offended, well then you remove almost every movie that's ever been made. You remove almost every book that's ever been written. You take away almost every standup comedian set and you just get you, you fucking

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       nerf the shit out of the world and everybody is boring. And that's not the answer. It's not the answer. I think this is a meniscus or the reason why I, I, I'm so happy to have done the Justine sacco story in my book because I had so much pushback and each time I get pushed back, I feel more and more happy that I did it. Like [inaudible] gave a talk in knowledge. One of the first talks I gave was a knowledge in England. Um, and somebody in the Q and a, somebody said to me, somebody called out, are you a racist? And I was like, cause I defended just him and his like, you know, so for 30 years I'm writing about abuses of power. And the first time I say we're the one's abusing our power. So when he goes out, are you a racist?

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       And then, um, um, I can try to fill it with, he isn't that one person is our, you're just dealing with really simple thinking or that's just not a nuanced objective. Well thought out view of a human being. What they're doing is looking for an opportunity to call you out on something. Yeah. Looking for an opportunity to shame you. And that's what I, the problem I have with all this social justice warrior bullshit that's going on in the world is it's Manufa, it's manufacturing a lot of hate and it's manuf manifesting itself in a very angry way. Where what, what should be people that are pro gay rights, Pro Chan's gender rights, pro gay marriage pro, a pro piece, pro choice pro love pro left wing ideology. You know there's like do unto others as you out have them do onto you. This whole idea of like creating a more peaceful world and the way they're going to do it is by ruining everybody who doesn't agree with them and shitting all over them and insulting them and not distinguishing between what's actual social justice and what's the kind of Cathartic alternatives to social justice like it's structured.

Speaker 3:          01:04:16       Have tested the deception of Justine doesn't do any good for anybody because she wasn't even intending to be racist. She was trying to make a liquid. She, so it'd be like coach, he's going to be like Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Right? This isn't someone who's going after a cop that shot a kid with a fake pistol or anything. You know? This is, yeah, exactly. And this is the real problem. And the inability to distinguish between the citizens discretion on the unsafest transgression and what is creating as a kind of surveillance society as kind of stars. He where everybody's more fearful. Everyone's scared to say things. Um, the great thing about social media was how it gave a voice to voiceless people. And now people are fleeing social media because they're realizing that the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless. See, I don't think that's true.

Speaker 3:          01:04:59       I don't think they are fleeing. I think they're jumping out in droves. I think some people are jumping off, but I think that what you said, the great thing about it is it gives a voice to people. It's also a terrible thing about it. But I think what this is, is, as I said before, is this is like a, this adolescent stage of communication. We're reaching this new level of interaction where we can interact with each other instantaneously. And that's just never, by the way Tesla predicted this to Tesla predicted smartphones a hundred years ago. And I, I tweeted this quote today that somebody sent my way absolutely fascinating. Um, it was, uh, not just a quote. It was a, um, a, um, a, a piece that Tesla had written and life in 1920s, amazing where he predicted smartphones, like literally described a modern smart phone scroll down like w w were his actual words like, no, no, it's below that.

Speaker 3:          01:05:56       You actually read it. When wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is all things being particles have a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony like phones, we shall be able to hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face despite intervening distances of thousands of miles and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this. We'll do this. Do His will be, oh, do his will, Huh? To do, hey. Oh Dude will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket. Holy Shit. Fuck. That is unbelievable. Fucking unbelievable. When you read that paragraph, you think TSF, Oma, God, you know when we have that world for ourselves, what an amazing we'll do.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       It will beer. The beer world of curiosity will be a world of like understanding strangers of nuance of contexts and said, we have the world and we completely throw away curiosity. We throw away once we throw away contexts and what we have instead is condemnation. Well with dummies, but not with everybody on TV. Look, I'm way more informed now than I ever would have been if I had grown up in the 1960s like if I grown up in the 1960s and I was a 47 year old man in 1967 I wouldn't know Jack Shit. I would be an ape. I mean that is true. But I do fair, you know, my, I mean I do fear that, you know, maybe there's two types of people in the world. Those people who favor humans over ideology and those people have favorite ideology of humans. And Right now the ID looks uh, a winning on central.

Speaker 3:          01:07:41       I don't think they are. I think they did not. No, I just think they're making more noise. And I think that it's, it's really a matter of who those ideological people are surrounding themselves with. I think they could be swayed into a more understanding nature and we can decide this is what somebody wrote about my book, which I really great with. Uh, something about, you know, we can decide who to listen to that with Justine sacco. The problem was that the bullies one la, everyone is too scared to defend chesty nobody defended just do that. No sub you, you brave bastard. Look at you. Yeah. Well a woman code handling Lewis who writes for the New Statesman wrote a review of my public shaming book. She said that she tries to defend Justine at night. She wrote, I'm not sure. The joke was intended to be racist and straight.

Speaker 3:          01:08:26       Yeah, I'd straight away she got this fury of you're just a privilege bitch too. So she said to her, to her shame, she shut up. And that's what happened that night. Like everybody shut up. And it wasn't just on social media like the mainstream media or got involved. It was like, you know, and, and that became like the dominant narrative about Justine sacco was actually, it was kind of racist and I, and anybody who tried to stick up for her just got, got screamed down. Well, I'm almost any defending her in defending her. I would say she's probably a little racist, which you can't really think like that. It's okay to say that if you're not a little racist. But in cracking that joke and saying something like that, which is uncertain, unquestionably a racist joke, just kidding. I'm white. Lol. Right? Yeah. That's fucking racist.

Speaker 3:          01:09:18       You know, think that stress for me, it's like a bad Randy Newman saga mean Randy Newman's sign short people. So people got no reason to live. Like we also said, I love La. You know, is that tongue and cheek as well? Yeah. This tongue and cheek because he sings, look at those mountains, look at those trees, look at that bum over there, man. He's down on his knees. You know, it's a lot Randy Newman will do is that he will acknowledge his own privilege and then do a kind of grotesque, extreme version of it. So comedy, he does that. And so what people who does it and I love La and I think that's exactly what just in soccer was doing and that joke, she was acknowledging her own privilege and then mocking it, but I didn't kind of grotesque version of it. And the only difference between Justin and Randy Newman was there just in with just wasn't any fucking good at it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:02       Right. That's a good point. I see your point. Um, it's, it's hard to argue that it couldn't possibly offend people, but the idea that she knew she was broadcasting it to all those people that were offended. I think people just don't understand what the fuck is going on when they say things online that you know when the New York Times extracted my book and if fact check with the New York Times, phoned up Justine and said to her like, so before you got on the plane, we used surprise that like he didn't get any replies because while she was like, you know all happened after she turned off her phone and fell asleep and she said I had 170 Twitter follows. Nobody ever replies to it. So she was usually like as a, she's like yelling into an empty room flight. So she probably got unreasonably cocky because of that.

Speaker 3:          01:10:48       Exactly, yeah. She got on a plane and so she's probably on Xanax and drinking, which is what a lot of people do when they get on planes. That's like a fucking, this lady was explaining to me that that's, she was like, like she was bragging about it like, you mean a glass of wine? I was Xanax and I don't give a fuck about anything. She was, it was hilarious. She was just talking and I was like, I wonder how many people take Xanax and get on planes and apparently talking to people that take Xanax, it's super common, right? They get anxiety, they're going to get a long plane and also sleeping pills. People take all asleep sleeping pills and they get on planes

Speaker 1:          01:11:22       can Xanax. I was um, it's when order, this was happening to me that when the New York Times, you know, extra Kmart and, and it was just so noisy. It's sort of my noisiest stories of when the book came out, it was incredibly noisy. And I went to the studio to do this video, uh, like talking about my book and the woman on before me, um, was a doctor and she was doing a video about her book and she said, what's your book about? And I said, public shaming, which is all digital media piece in the New York Times about Justine sacco. And I said, I wrote it. And she said, Oh wow, God, you must be so happy. I said, actually I'm not happy. And she said, why aren't you happy? And I said, cause everyone is just so much noise. And then he said to what he want and I said a Xanax,

Speaker 3:          01:12:07       she got out, tighten, wrote me a prescription for like sixties adducts of which, by the way, I've had one and a half. Uh, I don't abuse Xanax. Breath off. Fuck. It's easy to get medication and it's very easy to get medication in United States. If you go to the right doctors, meaning go to any doctor. Did you thought fuck, take it? I took law. I took like a half. It was like, that made me feel a bit, I was no longer anxious. I felt groggy and then I have to weigh up what would I rather feel? Groggy or anxious? Welcome to America. That's our dilemma. Rocky. All anxious, groggy, anxious, caffeinated or on Adderall. But then I thought, God, like when she said to me, what are you warm? Like all I could think of to say was annex within. Did I miss like an amazing opportunity?

Speaker 3:          01:12:53       Like I don't know anything I didn't know anything about, you know, with the light, much like way better things than sound. Next I could have asked you like really in a painkillers I guess, but you'd have to like say that you're on pain. Xanaxes you could say you have anxiety and they'll give you a medication. Yeah. You know, I know the guys do a w how do he went to a doctor to get prescription because uh, he was a social justice warrior and a, he said a bunch of incorrect things and people attacked him and so he had to go to the doctor. So he's freaked out. Like he got a taste of his own medicine, but that fucker I saw him like six months later. It's still shitting on people online. Like you didn't, didn't learn from the attack on him. Like it's almost like they get caught up in this, they get addicted to this drama of shitting on people of attacking people.

Speaker 3:          01:13:42       Yeah. It's weird. You know what? Since I, I mean I don't do it anymore. I do not pile it on anybody anymore. Even people who deserve it. I tend not to pile in on anymore. I tell you what, where I think it still comes from the fact in my book, the suck for me anyway, my book, the psychopath test, I, I'm really critical of like labeling coach and really I'm critical of like the fact that the Dsm is 886 pages long and has a mental disorder for everything. And uh, and I, I most people I think agree with me that that's kind of, it's like easy to

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       agree with me about that. But then on social media we do exactly the same thing we labeled p and yet, so the very same people who agree with me about the, the kind of, you know, what's wrong with labeling culture in the world, go home and do it themselves and social media. I've been really torn with this very strange our dear lately. Um, I had this conversation with my good friend Duncan Trussell and we were, um, we were talking about labels and um, and self definition and the, the, the, the sort of imprisonment of definition. And I said, well, even words like names for people. Like, my name is Tom, you know, fuck head. You know, whatever. And that has taught, you know, you're a Whitmore and as a Whitmore, you know, you're, you're supposed to stand for something in this world that I think, yeah, we're Ronson's, goddammit, you're on Rogan.

Speaker 2:          01:15:01       Stephin up. Boy. I think these ideas of, of like having a name, like a label. Like you're, you're Coca Cola, you know, you're Jamie Vernon. You know, there's this, I think having, instead of just being, you like having names even dames themselves, like, and he'd say, Oh, well you know what to expect. It's that fucking John Ronson guy. You know, like all of a sudden you can be boxed in and defined. You're not just a human being who is sort of like a existing with these other human beings. You are a labeled human being and that label can be great. You know, you can be the Dalai Lama or that label can be shit. You could be Donald Trump, you know, and you're, you right now, Donald Trump has an easy pylon. Everybody will jump on him. He said a bunch of racist things about Mexicans and much dumb shit during his speech announcing he's going to be president.

Speaker 2:          01:15:54       He's an easy pylon and he's also a guy that sort of embraces self definition. He embraces his label so much so that he puts his label on the top of a building. Trump towers. This is the, the Trump casino on the Trump this and like it's a part of the definition I think any sort of definition like that. Like officer, professor, you know, doctor, you know, how about people that want, like Cosby was making people call him a doctor when he got an honorary doctorate. You know, I guess maybe, you know, secretly it was a, a big joke for him cause he was drugging people, you know, allegedly. Yeah. New News right now it's came out, he admitted to 2005 and court, I'll show you the little article. Oh well this just, oh, just happened. All my goodness. He it in a 2005 deposition that he obtained quite ludes a sedative with the intent of giving them to women he wanted to have sex with according to records obtained by the Associated Press on Monday, the admission was contained in records that were unsealed after the AP went to court to compel the release. Cosby's attorneys had repeatedly sought to keep the record sealed, arguing that they would be embarrassing. This was, um, a case that Cosby I'm paid a woman off and then, uh, because he had paid off

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       part of the deal. Uh, part of the arrangement was that the records are to be sealed. So they, uh, went to court and wow, he's fucked now. It, we were like three and a half. Another thing I was reading this big, I said, God, what a monster. What's the statute of limitations? And all of their staff can vary. Any questions? I think I can be, well, 2005, I can't imagine the statue of limitations is, well, if that's 2005, that's when he admitted it. But when was the actual instance? That's monster shit. That's really, that's dehumanizing shit. I think we can go, that's a long conversation. It's sort of semi-related the definition of bill Cosby because bill Cosby is, is sort of iconic individual and bill Cosby has a celebrity and because of that he was worshiped and treated like a celebrity. And I think because of that worship, he sort of had an expectation of worship and also an egg.

Speaker 3:          01:18:05       This is total armchair psychology from a dude who went to college for three years and barely paid attention. But the, I think the, the expectation of that and the years and years of that much like being a spoiled child and leads you to be a person who expects that from people and can even justify horrific behavior because you actually do think that you're better than someone the same way. Royalty does the same way, you know, people who have not grown up their lines, that behavior and growth kind of reason. And a lot of ways, I mean, I think there's, I think it's related in a way to the idea of labeling, labeling and you know, just, you know, that's not a human being. That's a police officer, officer Johnson, you know, uh, you refer to the judge as your honor. You know, you, you can't go, hey man, you know, I know you're reading off a book, but don't lock me in a fucking cage cause I had a joint order in the court who we'll refer to him as your honor.

Speaker 3:          01:19:07       You know what I mean? Like that, that all that stuff, they'll fucking, when they used to wear a crazy wigs and outfits, what are they doing? Well, they're separating themselves. They're differentiating themselves and their labeling though they're, they're putting themselves in a very distinctive position, lay. And it's, it's really one of the, it's one of the worst things that's happening in this country at the moment. Uh, that I in, in, in the psychopath test, I writes about how these kids as young as one and two are getting labeled bipolar because everyone is so in love with the checklists that a kid goes to see a psychiatrist with a temper tantrum and [inaudible] goes higher and the bipolar check list. So if it then given antipsychotic medication at the age of light, literally one and two, that's how much labeling culture is out of control. You don't, I said Dude, and it's the question I love asking most is why, you know, cause I opens doors, you know why you have to go some of us.

Speaker 3:          01:19:57       But with labeling culture, including labor and culture on social media, it's lie, it closes doors, labels closed us questions, open doors where they certainly define in like a very concrete way. This is what I felt, you know, I felt most a step lightly with the whole Rachel dollar shower thing because when I heard that story I just thought that is so mysterious and complicated and nuanced and you know, maybe she's, maybe she's mentally ill or maybe she's not. Whatever's going on here. This is like really fucking mysterious and interesting and I like a thousand questions. And so I went on Twitter expecting that that would be Twitter's response to, they'd have like a thousand questions, but no, people were either like ridiculing her or attacking her like yelling black face or whatever. But there's plenty of people supporting her, her position as being trans racial. Those are my favorite, right?

Speaker 3:          01:20:54       Those people, rod durable. Right. But I just thought fucking hell, I can't, you know what I thought, I thought I'd been a journalist for 30 years and I'm sick and I don't know where to go with us, but I thought I'm really sick of like damaged people being other people's play things, either ideological placings or play things for mockery or whatever. And obviously there's nothing wrong with comedy and satire and mockery. I, and that's fine, but nonetheless, so God [inaudible]. But nonetheless, I'm just sort of sick of, of cruelty. Yeah. Making other human beings are play things instead of, you know, for whatever reasons, instead of like curiosity. Well, if it was as simple as play, uh, play things like, just, just straight up mockery, I would expect that you would get some clever humor out of it. But it's hate. There's a lot of anger and hate and this whole public shaming thing sort of goes along with that.

Speaker 3:          01:21:56       I mean, there's some people that I follow that I don't agree with. And a w unfortunately, I agree with their position on a lot of things like a marriage, like, you know, uh, equality for all. Like there's so many different things that I agree with like extreme left wing people on that. It's really problematic because when some of them adopt this sort of social warrior public shaming stance, I'm so torn because on one side I want to go after them. [inaudible] another side. I agree with almost all of their positions on equality for women and equality for gay people and across, I mean there's so many of the positions that I have the exact same stance on, but I don't have this stance on public shaming or if I do, my stance is public humor. You know, my, my stance, whether Chris Christie says he's gonna lock up everyone who smokes marijuana, you know, oh, because marijuana is so dangerous.

Speaker 3:          01:22:52       I'm like, Jesus Christ. Do you have a fucking mirror in your house? You're morbidly obese and you're telling people that they can't have a substance that has never killed a single person ever over being overweight is one of the major causes of premature death in the United States of America. But how having a heart attack is one of the major causes and having a heart attack is almost directly related in most people to being overweight. I mean it's a huge issue and this fucking Slob is on television telling people that he's going to stop marijuana because it's dangerous and the only stuff and hot dogs in its fat face like to me a guy like that has to be mocked because it's, it's there and that's my job. Just like the fucking crocodile sees the wounded antelope and it gets too close to the waterhole, it can't help it.

Speaker 3:          01:23:39       It's got a snap ad. If I'm a comic and you say something stupid like that and you are just as blatantly obvious target, like that is a dangerous person in my, in my opinion, because he's a person who could dictate policy. Well, he's a person who can make laws and he's a person that literally can lock people up in jail. He can get, he can get people's freedom taken away. Yeah. He had punching up and nipping funny and there's nothing, you know, I, I'd be a real dope if I was going to stop being against things like that. I guess, you know, what my books against is the disproportionate punishment of people who don't deserve it. And that's the bullying. Yeah. It's piling on. I mean, it, it, it's, it's also having a lack of, there's a lack of perspective that comes with a lot of these pile on bullying.

Speaker 3:          01:24:23       Things like the, um, the what, what's the woman's name again? Soco. Justin. Yeah. Rachel Dolezal thing. First of all, um, she handled herself very well on Matt Lauer. Yeah. I should say, by the way, that may sort of saying all do that stuff on Twitter was raw at the beginning before she'd said anything. I was like to say, look, we don't know anything about this woman. You know, we don't know anything. Like everyone's jumping to conclusions, nobody knows anything. And I was just like, screamed at for that. And she had some other issues though that were exposed as time went on. And one of them is, she's a plagiarist. Oh yeah, yeah. She plagiarized some art and she was selling some art that she clearly plagiarized and she's just deceptive. She lied about her background. She said she was born in a teepee. Like she's just not a truthful person.

Speaker 3:          01:25:07       And sometimes when people don't enjoy their life, um, you know, I've, I've met a lot of kids when I was young that, you know, came from really fucked up backgrounds and those are the ones that told like the really big lies. And I think that a lot of those lives were because they didn't like their reality, you know, and that's, they didn't, they didn't ask to be born that, you know, there's a mystery, right. With people like that you liked. So what happened? Why do you feel that way? What's going on? Whereas effectual delish I like the minute this breaks some social media. If it wouldn't just like, you know, fucking racist, shut the fuck up. There's no questions. It's black. You would get really angry because she's appropriating a disenfranchise segment of society has already been stolen from, from white by white people. You know, and I had people tweeting me to say, you know, you were white man. This isn't your story. Get ancillaries, isn't it? You don't have, you're not allowed to have an opinion because you weren't born with the right amount of melanin in your skin. So mind

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       is not working right. Would they said this is your story. You can't come until this. This is cause this isn't your story. That's bullshit. When I felt it kind of was my story because I've, for 30 years I've been writing about trouble people and I've come to conclusions about the way you should regard of the people at the human beings with sort of interest in curiosity and compassion, not cold, hard judgment. So that's where I came from and that story. It's also that the saying that it's not, you're not allowed,

Speaker 2:          01:26:32       I have an opinion or it's not your story. That is you. What you're trying to do is you're trying to silence anybody that doesn't agree with you. Everyone that is a human being that witnesses a story you witnessed, some public thing was taking place. You are absolutely allowed your opinion and if you're not going to allow people to speak up about things and have opinions about things, whether these opinions are informed or uninformed, that's all going to be sorted out in the wash. But it to say it's not your position to talk well then your public

Speaker 1:          01:27:06       like silence people and you know exactly what that is. The opposite of of course is is democracy. And when I was reading people, I went off social media after all of that cause there was so much screaming and I was reading people basically saying, okay, let's go to John Ronson into saying something outrageous and then we can get him. Is that what they said? Yeah. I always feel like, you know why they'd say that? It's because, uh, the, the young have decided for some misdefined reason to create an incredibly stressful world for themselves. I don't think they realize what they are, it's what they're

Speaker 2:          01:27:39       doing. Um, but the, the Rachel dolls all thing was, uh, to me it was a perfect example of how ludicrous human beings are, how ridiculous our society is and how this woman is. Like, first of all, the NAACP was founded by white people as something a lot of people don't know. And Black folks weren't even allowed to hold office until the 1970 [inaudible] while at the cotton club. And a lot of ways, well, it was actually founded by New York City intellectuals, I believe. I hope I'm not doing this wrong, that, um, they, they really, uh, it was in response to all the lynchings and, you know, they were like, they were just, they were compassionate, intelligent, uh, progressive people that we're trying to figure out a way past this horrible situation that the world, it found himself in post slavery where there was all this resentment and there was, there was lynched lynchings and just the chaos that is the south. And you know, I think we're still dealing with the reverberation of the repercussions and the reverberations of it right now with this confederate flag debate that's going on all throughout America now. It's like America's just sort of kind of waking up to the fact that we'll fuck man, a hundred or so years ago you were allowed to own people, you know, and the people that wanted to be able to own people had a flag

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       and these people put that flag on a car and drove it around on TV and we didn't think about it. Yeah. You know, and now we're thinking about it and you know the rec code, by the way, I was always disappointed when the chooks, if house it was on TV that because of the flag. No, just cause it wasn't as good as wonder woman. But this is a cut attention. What about Daisy Duke? Well wonder what, it was pretty fucking hot too. I spent a lot of time with the Ku Klux Klan. You know, from, from my book there, my, I discovered this, I'm politically correct faction of the Ku Klux Arkansas. Yes. Run by a guy called Tom Rob who decided that the Klan had a really bad image. Ah, he was going to do something about it recently. Notice it's like the mid nineties. I wrote about it in my book then why is he back in the news?

Speaker 1:          01:29:48       No, there's another group, another factor of the Ku Klux Klan that was allowing black people and they wanted to allow black people in. Oh really? Where that is the kind of thing that Tom would have done. In fact, Tom was accused by other white supremacists of kissing a black baby. Um, I, and you have to kind of deny it. You got to hit to issue a denial black baby. But I went to, I went to Tom's house and he directed, so we'd band, I went to this big annual convention and he banned like the robes and the hoods. They were allowed to wear robes one day. Uh, and they were loud and they were allowed to burn a cross one day. Yeah. And it was the day that I turned up and they were all stunned to grab this giant cross. It's lying on the ground. And they couldn't remember because they were also rusty.

Speaker 1:          01:30:36       They couldn't remember whether to soak it and then raise it or raise it and then soak it. Oh, that's hilarious. Those starting ground. And then Tom comes over and they go, Tom, we cut. Do we soak it and then raise it or raise it and then soak it. And Tom Goes, you soca and then raise it. How the, how the hell are you going to lie? So kind. I don't say, Hey Carrie. I know. Then Tom looks at me as if to say, I'm so sorry that my members are such idiots. Like Tom preferred me to the clown. Oh my God, that's a door. And then he, and then they had this kid in his garden. Um, and they're all doing this kind of personality skills, workshops. Like, like they were filling out these multiple choice, like which strengths and weaknesses most apply to you. Um, I always remember like one of the strengths, the weaknesses was mixes easily, which normally would be like a strength.

Speaker 1:          01:31:27       But if you're the clan it's been, it's gotta be weakness. And then another one was warrior. And what are the classmen was like going, well, I don't consider being a warrior to be a weakness. And then like the person doing the test was like, why is she being a worrier can be a weakness. And he thought it was warrior and it was worrying. Oh God. Yeah. Worrier. Are you a worrier? Englishes English. Yeah. I was an Englishman. I'm a worrier. Oh, I see. Yeah. Well I could see someone saying I'm a worrier, but I couldn't see it as a question. Are you a worrier? I would see, think the question would be a little bit more straight forward like do you worry a lot? I've got, I've got to say to kind of genetic most poor choice question and answer thing. Worry. I would be like an odd word to have had that.

Speaker 1:          01:32:11       Are you a warrior? Yes sir. I am. I'm a warrior for the race, but I'm not. I'm a warrior now. What is the reason why they burn the cross? It's a cross. They couldn't across the lighting, not a cross burning. It goes back to glass half full sort of a thing. I think it goes back to the Scottish, I believe it's all to do with like, I can't remember if they told me, you know what it's like being a journalist. Like you know everything. For sure it's hard, but then you move onto the next story. You write your, sorry, forget it. Oh, I've got a terrible memory. Anyway, I've lost it. It's like being a podcast or two. We've talked about things. We've done 667 episodes now so we can not to six, six, seven, six, six Duncan Trussell fake evil fakey well he's a great guy, but he could play evil.

Speaker 1:          01:33:03       One time I was, uh, I went on a road trip with the Klan from Harrison, Arkansas to St Paul. Long journey, like 17 hours. I was in a car for 17 hours with the Klan. Whoa. I, at one point Tom turned to me the leader and he said, can I ask you a question? And I said, well, and he said, do you think I'm weird? Wow. Yeah. And I was like, I think you're in a transitional phase between where to not wear it. Oh, that's interesting. So you were playing like psychological, uh, when I was in the car with game lamb, but saying there isn't a transitionary period. Like what did you mean by that? Well, cause he was trying to, you know, trying to do an image maker virtue and be more politically correct. It didn't really turn out in, did he feel that black people were inferior to white people to be really clearly feel that?

Speaker 1:          01:33:54       Well, he would probably call himself like a white sat protest, but he wasn't actually, I'm an, I've met white separatists like Randy Weaver and Fr. The third nicer people than Tom was a Randy Weaver who's a Ruby Ridge guy. Right. He's wiped separatist. I'm really gone. I got on well with the weaver has gotten really why Rachel, his daughter in that story is kind of a fucked up story. Right? Like he was a, they had a house alone in the woods and they were killed by snipers. Right. Yeah. This is a really bad story. So they were, this is the first story I ever did where I feel like I kind of twisted it rounds that the people who would normally be the villains were the good guys, the people that normally be the good guys. Were the villains satisfied good about that. So basically they were family of light, you know, they believe in Bohemian Grove and Bilderberg and I went, I am tried to infiltrate, build a book one time by the way, and got chased away by their hedgemon.

Speaker 1:          01:34:46       I don't if this time to tell that story as a planet. Okay. So, uh, so they moved to this cabin up in the words on top of the mountain and Idaho, Ruby Creek, Idaho and Randy, uh, would hang out at the local area nations with the family. That was his big undoing was that he, we would take the family up to area nations who were just, you know, a fucking nuts, like violent skin, had nuts and Randy would take his family up there for like picnics and away days and so on. So Arian nations, like pretty much every white supremacist, you know, group in America was heavily infiltrated by, by undercover officers. And they saw a Randy and saw his family and could tell that Randy was less crazy than the other people there. So they approached Randy and said, you want to become an undercover informant?

Speaker 1:          01:35:40       And Randy said, no. So then Mandy thought that was that. But then they sent a guy to ask Randy to saw off a shotgun. So He's, so he said, okay fine. So we sawed off shotgun slightly below the legal limit, like the guy pointed at him. It's a no, so it off there. So we sorted off there and then they said, ah, we've got you. Um, this was an undercover cop. You've now committed to firearms offense. You will go to jail in less. You become an undercover informant for us. And Randy being a, being a Twat said no fuck off. And he kind of embarrassed the feds in front of his wife. He said, look at those two guys over there. Guess what they just asked me to do? And so Randy was like an idiot. And then he, he locks himself up in the cabin with his wife and kids and dog.

Speaker 1:          01:36:27       Um, and then, and so they surrounded the cabin, the ATF. And this went on for like a year, uh, that they set up cameras in the trees and surrounded Roundy's cabinet. And one day the, um, the, the ATF people got too close to the cabin and disturb the dog and the dog starts barking and the dog chases the agents down the hill. And Randy's little boy who was, who was like 12 years old or something. Sammy chased the dog down the hill with a gun because Randy, like an idiot had armed his kids. And uh, so they all run down to the bottom of the hill and agents jumps out and shoots the dog, kills the dog. Sammy says, you killed my dog, you son of a bitch and start shooting wildly. And the agent shoots Sammy in his arm and basically shoot his arm nearly off.

Speaker 1:          01:37:19       And somebody yells, Dad, I'm coming home dad. And starts running up the hill. And the ATF agent just shoots summary in the back cause he's running up the hill just instead, sort of volley of gunfire. So, so some is now dead. This story doesn't get any better, I should tell you, Sam is now dead. Rundy get some, these body puts them in the shed. And then the next day, oh, um, one of Randy's friends is there and there's a shootout and one of the agents I called bill and gets killed tools and I've got to dead people. You've got a dead agent and you've got Sammy Dad. Um, the jewelry's always been asked as to whether the agent was killed by Randy's friend or by friendly fire. Um, so anyway, the next day, Randy goes outside and an FBI sniper called Alon Harriet. She shoots Randy in the shoulder. So Randy runs back in and Vicki Randy's wife was standing in the doorway holding a baby and a sniper shoots Vicki through the head and kills a, and they'd pull Vicky's body into the cabin.

Speaker 1:          01:38:27       And, and a siege starts like a 16 day siege or something. And art that I had the road blocked down at the bottom. That's kind of where the militia movement started, like all these local militia people or form at the bottom of the roadblock and for days, and then discover that Vicky's dad. And, and I mean, I've seen some amateur footage and it's tiered, so sad. And, and I became really good friends with Rachel, who's Randy's younger daughter, uh, who was in the cabin full of that time. And I did. In the end, the government admitted responsibility and paid each around these daughters a million dollars each and they killed Randy. Uh, no, Randy still alive. Rezzy now? Yeah. Randy now goes to gun shows where you can have your photograph taken with Randy. We for $4. God. Yeah. And how much? $5. He sells himself. Quite short bargain.

Speaker 1:          01:39:15       Yeah. A historical figure. So that's, so one of the people who visited Randy's cabin. I've visited Randy's cabin with Rachel and another person who visited Randy's cabin was Timothy Mcveigh. Um, shortly before blowing up the Murrah building in Oklahoma City. Have you ever seen the conspiracy theories on that? About yeah, I visited della him city. The place which you know about, right. The place where you know, I, you know, I know I've got a kind of reputation for being a, a debunker of conspiracies and, and the reputation has cut a warranted in most cases, but I've got to say of all the things I, I investigated when I was doing a lot of stuff about conspiracies. The one where I thought this is a bit fucking fishy was, was Oklahoma City. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:40:03       Oh, it's, it's most certainly fishery. What's most certainly fishy is the efficacy of that bomb. The bomb that they used, a fertilizer bomb that blew half there building apart when you talked to bomb experts, they go that is like really, really unlikely. And they said that the amount of damage that a bomb like that that's made out of fertilizer can do is nothing in comparison to what that building was like. And also that that building, um, looked like it had been blown out. Not it had been blown in but blown out, meaning that there was bombs planted inside the building. And then there was all these news reports as another one of Alex Jones is a, uh, stories. There was all these news reports that he played these clips of where they were talking about FBI agents for moving bombs, unexploded bombs from the building, and that there were more than one bomb.

Speaker 2:          01:40:56       And then they had this, you know, this narrative that they blamed it on Timothy Mcveigh and what was the other guy's name? Terry Nichols. Terry Nichols. Yeah. And um, that it was this fertilizer bomb. And remember there's like, oh, there's all this, they were looking for a guy from Iraq and there was all this, like the different stuff that was going on in the news, like right after it was over. But then they had settled on the story that he had done it and they had done it all with this fertilizer bomb. But, um, it's, it's, it's a weird one because, I mean, I don't have an answer and I don't even have a theory like who could have done it or how it was done or what would have been done. I mean, look, all we know is someone blew up that fucking building. I mean, if it was just him and Terry Nichols, it was just Timothy Mcveigh and Terry Nichols. Um, that to me is no more crazy than it was a bunch of other people that planted bombs inside the building. It's all a heinous act of horror and murder.

Speaker 1:          01:41:48       Yeah. The way it, the way it thing that we discovered tonight when I was doing the Oklahoma's story was it's best called Ella him city. If you have you heard of this place? So I visited Alahan city, uh, the old Dale. This is like this kind of white separatist stroke supremacist compound and the Arkansas or Oklahoma board as an in the Ozarks spooky spot. Yeah. I turned up in the audit, the river dance for me. Oh, Jesus. Yeah. I'd just been chased through Portugal by the Bilderberg group and I bonded with them over that. Like I tell him, I told him, I don't know, I just been chased by bill. Yeah. Everyone, all of these, all of that crowd back there knows you've got Bilderberg. Um, and I said, yeah, I've just been chased by the Bilderberg group, which I was, I, um, it in my book then when I was trying to infiltrate secret societies, I went to Portugal with Jim Tucker.

Speaker 1:          01:42:44       Um, the, he ran, he worked for this magazine called the spotlight, which was run by this kind of white separatist group called the liberty lobby in Washington DC. Basically everybody kept telling me about this group called the Bilderberg group that no one had heard of back then. Only only real niche aficionados that her to build a poke back then. Um, and, uh, much in the same way that I kind of law. I feel like I partly launched Alex Jones, his career. I also feel like partly gave the world build a bird because I was the first lap mainstream writer to write about it because everyone was saying that there's this group called the Bilderberg group and they secretly rule the world from inside a secret room. Uh, and I said, if you ask big Jim Tucker, he'll tell you more. So, so I phoned up Jim Tucker, uh, and he said, yeah, it's true.

Speaker 1:          01:43:29       They always meet once a year to five star hotel with golfing facilities. And that's where they all the world. And he said, you've caught me at a good time. I want to say look like something out of like sub spade. I had an office of 50 should blind to the word trill bay, and he smoked like 80 a day. Uh, he said that he had emphysema, which made him sound even more like seminar. He died a couple of years ago, but he lusted a fuck of lot longer than I had to put money on him. And I, I met him in March and I thought he'd be dead by May, but actually lasted about another 10 years. Wow. Yeah. He only dad recently, like a couple of years ago and this was [inaudible] 96 so Tim said, uh, he said, yeah, I've discovered where they've got to meet. Like my secret sauce has told me that there'd be to get the seaside Park Hotel at golfing resorted Sidra Portugal and I'm going to fly over there.

Speaker 1:          01:44:13       I apologize in my, send me American accent. Uh, I'm doing here is I got to fly over there and climbed up the drain pipes and get in and confronting red handed. Gogebic they're covert wickedness. So I said, can I come? And he said, okay, as long as you to use a term covert wicked. I might be slightly exaggerate, he might put an English, but basically I, I'm pretty sure he said he was going to cloud the Trophon, wickedness, white supremacy. That's all they talk. Yeah. So we flew the best, so be a, Jim Tucker flew to Portugal and scouted around the, the Park Hotel. And we decided that our cover story would be like, he'd be like a sales, we'd be salesman, but we didn't look at anything that fucking sales when I was like early thirties, you know, skinny little Jewish guy. And he was like this big southern gentleman.

Speaker 1:          01:45:02       So we looked like really fucking good shuffle. Yeah. Like gay couple. I could it be like as toy boy, uh, I like, we realize scouting a lot, try to talk to waitresses and stuff. This was the day before the Bilderberg group was reportedly go to arrive at this hotel. And then we left and we started getting, I looked in my rear view mirror and it was a car following me and, and a, and a chase ensued, um, like through the streets. I mean, I say a chase, I was going 30 miles an hour, so, so we say, but I keep thinking, I kept thinking, fuck, if I speed up, he's going to speed up. It's gonna be like a fucking chase. So it was very obvious. It was fine. He wasn't trying to be sneaky. No. Well, I stopped the car and he stopped his car like behind me.

Speaker 1:          01:45:47       So I, I thought I've got to say something to him. So I went over to the car and I like knocked on the window and there's a guy in dark glasses in the car looking straight ahead and I'm knocking on the window and he refuses to look at me. Like obviously his orders were to follow but don't engage. Like I'm suddenly in a world where I am lie big, followed by somebody whose orders are to follow and not engage. So I freak the fuck out. So I get back in the car and I phone up first I filled up my wife and I say, I'm being followed by the Bilderberg group. I am fucking terrified. And my wife goes, oh, you're loving it. And I'm like, oh no. And then I found it, oh gosh. Embassy and I brought at the British embassy and I said, I'm being followed by the Bilderberg group.

Speaker 1:          01:46:45       Um, and then the one for the British embassy goes and then she cold. And I'm like, I just want you to take a shot. I then she says, what do you do? They know, you know, did they know your hair? I mean, what are you, what are you doing here? And I said, I am essentially a humorous journalist out of my depth. Can you foam what I also said to her, to my shame, I didn't put this in my book or I write about all of this in my book. Then, um, what I didn't say, what I didn't put it in my book was that I also said to her, I said, I'm a humorous to enlist, started my depth. I'm a bit like Louis Theroux. And she's like, oh, like she's heard of him and not me. And I'm like, I don't. I'm like, yeah, but actually Louis often cites me as an inspiration. I swear to God, this is like my last day on earth. I'm about to be killed by the Bilderberg group telling the press officer for the British Embassy in Portugal that Louis actually speaks highly of me.

Speaker 1:          01:47:51       So then I, then she says, she says this, she said, this is the, this is like the most startling thing that happened that day. She said, well, the good news is if you know you're being followed, they're probably just trying to intimidate you, intimidate you, and the dangerous ones would be those you don't know a following you. And I'm thinking first, how the fuck does the press officer at the British embassy, no, this and hey, what if these people are the dangerous ones? And I just happened to be like naturally good at spotting them. Like I'm an anxious person. I, I will spot, like I suffer from anxiety. Like I will spot if somebody is following me. Right? Yeah. So anyway, so then she did not go back to my hotel and uh, the woman for the British embassy phones be back and says that she's spoken to the Bilderberg group and they've said that nobody is following me.

Speaker 1:          01:48:44       Yeah. So I'm like, he's behind the tree. Like I'm by the pool, I'm going, he's standing behind the tree and Chicos will not just sit tight. I'm sure it's going to, I'm sure it's going to go away. So I went down to the beach, Jim Tucker throughout all of this. By the way, he's loving it. He's loving every fucking second of this. It's his dream come true. I'm sure. Yeah. I go down to the bit, I'm petrified. I want to like abandon the story, like drive back to England from Portugal because I'm afraid I'm going to get like stopped at immigration. Uh, Yay in pretty much you can get in. Get the ferry from, from Paris. Uh, so, uh, so I think it's, it's like a two day drive, but fuck it. Right. So then I had a camera man with me, David Barker, cause I was filming some of this through a documentary.

Speaker 1:          01:49:30       He convinced me to like stick it out. Uh, so I went to the beach and then I, and then I came back to the hotel and I suppose God, there's these two men in dark glasses sitting in the lobby of the hotel. And as soon as I walk in, they both grab brochures and start reading them. And I'm like, fuck. So I go up to Jim Tucker and I said, there's these two men in the lobby and reading brochures in the morning pretending to read broaches uh, Jim says, how do you, how do you know? And I said, you can tell by their demeanor. And then later when Jim wrote all of this up for his conspiracy website, he like transcribe this conversation. And he said, I said to Rod, said, how could you tell I'm not send replied, you could tell them by this bell. And I'm glad I didn't say smell.

Speaker 1:          01:50:15       I said to me though, what does the Bilderberg or smell like? Yeah, like power. So the hedgemon spelled like badly paid power. So, uh, anyway, that was basically it. But, uh, the next day we went back to the hotel and instead at the bottom and watched all of these people driving up the drive. Um, Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller like, yeah, and they all really did turn up Vernon Jordan, who was Bill Clinton's lie man behind, you know, like, like, like Bill Clinton's like, you know, man in the background, lots of people in the background. Is there an official explanation for the Bilderberg group? Yeah, well, much later on, like after all this happened, I managed to interview three members of the Bilderberg group, including the secretary general, uh, and including one of their founding fathers who, so who was this British politician who's still alive, called Denis Healey, who was a big labour politician in the 1970s and he said, and I believe them, that Bilderberg was set up after the Second World War.

Speaker 1:          01:51:23       Um, because there was this big move against ideological politicians like post Hitler and I were doing any more hit LED's. So let's cut to create this sort of globalist one world new world order. I mean, you know, the, the phrase new world order I think is true. I think they were trying to create like a one world government or business would be more important than politics because business people are more trustworthy than ideological politicians. I think that that was their, that was their thesis back then. So it was kind of a centrist, almost kind of liberal in a, in a way. Um, if you buy that Jon Ronson, I've got a bridge to you in Portugal when I think that that was where they came from, but of course what they didn't account for or maybe did account for it and didn't give a shit was the CEOs would be just as fucking evil and uh, and, and malicious and ideological in their own way as politicians. And so that's why build a book became this kind of more nefarious, presumably became slightly more nefarious thing. Yeah. I think if the zone, if there's ever going to be one antidote for power is it's information. It's being able to expose all the dealings and secret organizations like the Bilderberg group or to a lesser extent, the Bohemian Grove type folks. Like I think only thing that sort

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       of mitigates that and diminishes that is everyone knowing about that and knowing more people, excuse me. No more people know about the bill burgs now than ever before. The Bilderberg group is like something that will, people will, they'll, they'll, they'll say it, they don't really know a lot. Like I'll say it, I don't know much about it. I know that really important. Rich people meet and they discuss things and every single person has ever been president has met. Yeah, I set that actually to the secretary general of the Bilderberg group when I interviewed him Skakel Martin Taylor, I said to, you know, you've got so many like up and coming politicians who ended up being like president or prime minister. And he said thank you. Lucky took that as a compliment. I like, you know, we're good at star spotting the next. And Denis Healey said to me, look, the idea, yeah, starts pissing.

Speaker 3:          01:53:33       And Dennis Haley said to me, the idea is to get these rising politicians and introduce them to the heads of business and hopefully influence them to be more sensible and more globalist and less less nationalist, I think horror them out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean it's a network. I mean, no question. No question. You know, all these places exist for a reason. I take a bit of credit. I think he might book them was the first time Bilderberg like was ever discussed in kind of mainstream, the mainstream world. And then shortly after me, this journalist called Charlie's scout and cable long, here's another sort of mainstream writer for the Guardian. And he goes every year to build a Burg now and partly result of hearing the parties may suddenly build a book is discussed in the mainstream world. But when I went to build a burger now, like loads of people like turn up to protest Bilderberg and so on, and they've even got a bit of a website now, I think.

Speaker 3:          01:54:26       And they certainly admit existing now and it didn't use to, they kind of have to write inflammation thing. Yeah. So it's partly to do with with them and partly to Charlie Skelton, your book, them. Uh, you know, I'm, I'm very fascinated by extremists and, uh, I'm very fascinated by, uh, I'm very fascinated by the spectrum of human thinking and behavior and that we're all kind of terrified of people that are on the far end in one way or another. We're terrified of like extreme lefties or terrified of extreme righties, you know. Did you, when did you, was anything like really revealing or unusual about that journey of trying to write that in your own mind? Did you try to like, one of the things I try to do when I watch like isis videos or a watch, like a radical fundamentalist Islamic guys talk, I try to imagine myself agreeing with them and being one of them and being happy to be one of them that like, you know, like there's, there's some, there's some appeal and some draw to being extremely confident about what you're saying.

Speaker 3:          01:55:37       Even if what you're saying is absolutely ridiculous, like stoning people for homosexuality and you see all of that happening on social media, which I write about in the new book. He had a, you see this cut of joy in approval. Mutual approval mean that's what I think is a problem with Twitter is it's, it's become like a sort of mutual approve or machine that we surround us as people feel the same way we do and we approve each other. And that's such a great feeling if everybody gets in the way and says, I don't agree with, with what you're doing here, you feel ferociously angry about that when he screamed them out. And Yeah. So I think this kind of mutual approval that goes on in both on social media and also an extremist groups, don't you think that people say things? A lot of the things they say, they say knowing that people are going to approve.

Speaker 3:          01:56:22       So they tailor these things in a way that like they lick their finger and put it up in the air and they catch the wind. Like, Ooh, the wind's going this way. I'm going to say something that puts me on the moral high ground. Yeah. I'm gonna get a lot of retweets. Yeah. Uh, yeah. And it's, it's, it's, I think it's kind of damaging. I mean, you know, like you said before, you know, I come from a social justice world, so I believe in all the things that they believe in. I believe in gay marriage. I believe in all of those things, but at the same time I feel kind of uncomfortable when I feel like there's a kind of ferocious conformity going that you have to, you have to say it like every time somebody dies you have to, I remember when Robin Williams died, like I was, I was doing a bit of, I would add, I was promoting some show I was doing or something I'd written and I didn't know Robin Williams had died and so I tweeted like something about some show I was doing and I got like a kind of, you know, 50 people immediately tweeted me basically saying, how dare you promote something when you know, we're also upset that Robin Williams has just died because I had notice of our music and there's that, there's that kind of conformance again, the kind of our Ip conformance and everybody has to the RFP and it's all good.

Speaker 3:          01:57:35       It's all coming from a good place. It's all coming from places that there's teaching us how to care and teaching us how to like level the failed. Not because how they know that you didn't know or how they know whether or not you knew. I didn't know. But that's really common. I mean, you can't be expected to be abreast of every single news story, especially something like a suicide, something that comes on and it's not like something that you have to pay attention to. Like, you know, a military operation that we're all aware of. No, this is a random celebrity decides to take his life. How could you possibly be forced to know about that? And I'm, the problem is, you know, like on, on social media we see ourselves is nonconformist. But what this does is create a kind of fearful, conformist world where you have to say what everybody else to say and quite conforming to nonconformity. Yeah. It's like I would see people that were, um, you know, um, they dress like rebels, but they dress like the same rebels. They're typically unique. You know, you see someone who's got their hair

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       is dyed pink and you know, they don't give a fuck, but you don't give a fuck. Like everybody around you doesn't give a fuck. Like you're wearing a uniform, whether you know it or not. You look like someone's going to Catholic school. Like you might think that you're some sort of a rebel, but the real rebels are indistinguishable from everyone else. And the way they dress and the way they, they look because they're just people you know, were there, there are no real rebels. Like all real rebel is just someone who has their own opinion that may or may not go with the standard opinion that we're being supposed to, uh, that we're, we're supposed to absorb. The idea of conforming to nonconformity is so ironic though. It's like the one thing that you are rallying against. It's the one thing that you don't even realize you are becoming.

Speaker 1:          01:59:28       Yeah. And it's, you know, the, the, the negative byproducts of all of this, a a big, it makes people fearful. It makes people shut the fuck up. Um, I also what it is, it declares war on human nature. You know, this is the reason why I really wanted to ride the public shaming book cause I, I felt like war had been declared on human nature instead of trying to work out why people transgress, you know, and it's sort of compassionate way. It's, it just, it just destroys people for transgressing, um, are and everybody transgresses Effie human transgressors. And when we so ferociously destroyer the people for transgressing, we're shutting off really significant realities about humans, which is a fact that if, if we tried to understand each other, it would make the world more compassionate and we would understand why people transgressed ball. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:00:27       What we're talking about too is you're, you're not talking about rallying against someone who's committing horrible atrocities. Someone's committing crimes against humanity, torturing people, murdering people. You're, you know, you're talking about differences of opinion.

Speaker 1:          02:00:43       Yeah. I mean some people's transgressions are so serious. It deserves to overwhelm them and they deserve to be defined by them.

Speaker 2:          02:00:51       And we're all like sort of in, commiserating and we're all sort of in agreement. We're all sort of bonding together on this, like, hey, like as humans we were, we're not going to tolerate this behavior because it's evil.

Speaker 1:          02:01:03       Yeah, yeah, yeah. But this is all a long way away from the question, which was about kind of hanging out with extremist groups and so on. And when I discovered some things that I think people would have known at the time in one was that they were all conspiracy theorists. You know, that was what United the Ku Klux Klan with the Islamic fundamentalist group or hung out with code [inaudible]. I spent a year with this Islamic group. Could have had to really spend a year with them. Yeah. I became like their, their chauffeur. They said to me, oh my Bakary the head of the group said to me after a few months, like, I have let you into my life, uh, I've given you much, I want something in.

Speaker 3:          02:01:39       So I was like, whoa. And he said, can you drag me to office world? I need pencils. Yeah. What do you need to guess? Photocopying, done, like crushed the pilot state of Israel. So I become like a show first up, driving him everywhere and yeah, that was the awkward. Did you go home? Did you, when you said you wear them for a year, like Hermione lift like a couple of miles up the road for me. You can get up in the morning. Bye honey. I'm going to go hang out with fundamentalism, hang out with Omar. He needs to pass some collection boxes for Hamas. And he said it needs to be driven to the cash and carry. Now Dan thought that's a very scary organization. This was pre nine 11. I'm an old. Most of the stories I've told them like today for my book them, which was pre nine 11, um, and so less scary.

Speaker 3:          02:02:28       Like people thought they were ridiculous. Like not that much had happened to that stage while I was there with them for the year though. I mean all you know now, so many like suicide bombers and so on and so many journalists get killed. Yeah, that's, I mean that could have been you easily if you were dealing with a decade later. Yes. Or even a couple of, I mean, when Daniel Pearl, that was pretty relaxed stages of the Iraq war, right? Two or three. I was only what, four years? And that was the first one, man, that was the first one. They had the video. I remember watching that online against my own better judgment and hasn't haunted you. Oh, you can never get past that one. And what's crazy is the one, that one, it had such an impact. And then I've seen a few of them since then and they didn't have nearly as much impact.

Speaker 3:          02:03:17       It's like slowly but surely you get numb to it because I've never watched any of these videos. But I was in Brooklyn and the taxi driver told me that he watches like all of them. And I said, I've never watched out here with him. And he said, well, I say the one you really shouldn't watch Daniel Pearl. Yeah. I haven't watched anything. So I did a, what he meant by that. There was a lot of conspiracy theories are evolving. That one as well. There was a lot of conspiracy theories that there was a, that he was killed by the CIA in order to keep people out of there and justify our attacks on Islamic fundamentalists and that they had killed him because he was going to reveal information about all sorts of different shit. And there was like a whole video dedicated to, uh, describing why these people were not Arabs and that their accent was wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:04:06       The, their size was wrong. They were built more like a American military people and the right conspiracy theories. It's a weird thing. It's because you mentioned conspiracies. I mean, you know, I got chased away from Bilderberg, I snuck into Bohemian Grove. There are conspiracies. Um, and there's also stuff like operation Northwoods where the Joint Chiefs of staff, it's signed that the papers saying that they were going to try to, uh, fake attacks on American civilians. They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack wanton him, obey the all in order to get us into a war with Cuba. I mean, so it's not like it hasn't been proposed or it hasn't been even act it out. Like what happened in the Gulf of Tonkin. I mean, there are real, real conspiracies that actually do happen even in its own little way. My, my book, the minister goats kind of proves conspiracies.

Speaker 3:          02:04:56       It proves that that they would charge in your book, sorry to interrupt you. What was the difference in your book and the movie? Uh, okay. In the book, I mean, I never actually went to Iraq, the Ewan Mcgregor cat, so that's kind of based on the goats were back in the movie in real life. I just hung around like military basis in America self, um, Fort Meade and Fort Bragg, uh, at the end of the movie, Ewan McGregor managers to walk through a wall and I never managed to work. I said I didn't have the movies kind of tongue in cheek. Yeah. The book is more serious. The book, the book starts off with the kind of comedy of all of this crazy stuff they were trying out in the seventies and eighties. Lat, trying to kill goats just by staring at them, tried to learn how to be invisible, which by the way, and after, after, after a while they adapted. They went from invisibility to trying to find a way of not being seen. So I'm like, that's, you know, I said like camouflage. No, I invented, I interviewed this guy who was a military guy that was work on their remote viewing. Yeah. Who, who was it? I would have probably met this person for his name. I'll Google was that day.

Speaker 3:          02:06:07       He went psychically spied the lot. Best months. Not, that's not soon determined that it was a dinosaurs ghost. A dinosaurs ghost zoning. Really Sad. Yeah. He's a character. He was showing me pictures of his hot girlfriend. Yeah. He was one of the main that day it was Joe mcmonagle. Like all of these real life stories. Real hot Russian. Well Dude, his baton way over side. So I met and maybe remote viewed that, uh, you know, if you're psychic spy, I tell you what, they're being a black cup military. Psychic spy isn't as glamorous as it sounds. Stressful, stressful. Plus, you've got your black ops, you've got no light budget, you've got no, you can't. You can't, you don't, you're not a lot of coffee machine. You have to bring your own coffee and to work. Really. Yeah. A couple of the remote viewers told me how annoyed they were that because they were black up, they had to bring their own coffee into it.

Speaker 3:          02:07:00       Plus what does it actually mean to be a psychic spy working for the U s military? What it actually means is that like for 20 years you go into some room at Fort Meade and try and be psychic. It's kind of a shit job. Yeah. I interviewed another guy, I forget his name, but we actually tried it out and uh, we tried to remote view things. Did they have any, did he get any luck? No. Those me and this guy, Dj growthy who's a, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's a skeptic. Randy Guy. Yeah. He's a, a debunker skeptic. And he and I were on the same page or like know we, we came up with

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       some random shapes and we're supposed to envision this area. And then we went to the area and he was trying to find hits. And I'm like, man, I mean you're talking like angles. Like you could fuck anywhere you go, that's man made, you're going to find angles that are similar to this. And you know, we picked out a few colors that were like super common. You find those colors. Yeah, we get some really lucky hits, but think about all the shit that we were wrong with. And he's all about like, it's just, don't think too much. Just let it come to you. Let it come you. So you're supposed to scribble shit down. And Yeah. So mind blowingly dumb. And the uh, ed dames guy was telling me that, uh, they had actually had found Osama, I think it was Osama bin Laden, he was saying, sorry for, can't remember correctly, because it was all nonsense to me at the time. But they didn't go after him because they didn't want to win the war because they didn't want the war to end. Right. Because the people had a vested interest in keeping the war going. And that was sort of as a idea behind why this remote viewing wasn't successful. But he was citing all these different instances where we're remote viewing was successful. And I was like, Ooh man, I don't know about all that.

Speaker 1:          02:08:41       Yeah. I remember one time they were looking for Noriega, General Noriega and the remote view with what I called in to find out. I'm one of the remote viewers. It might've been at dames, actually one of the remote viewers psychically defined that. Um, Angela Lansbury knew when Noriko was, oh, that bitch. Yeah. What? I don't know. What I don't know is whether they actually for, you asked Angela Lansbury order. What I discovered though, it just been remote viewing. I wouldn't have wanted to, to written a metastatic coats because I found the remote viewing things a bit boring. But then what I discovered just through asking people was there was all this other shit going on. Like they were trying to fast for a month, trying to burst clouds just by pointing them, try to kill goats just by staring at them. And, and, and that stuff was so fun to me.

Speaker 1:          02:09:30       And then I discovered after like a year of, of like interviewing these guys, I discovered that there was a line, I'm going to really crooked line but allied none the less between some of these crazy and Devis in the night and seventies and eighties and some of the kind of exotic in interrogation techniques that were happening at Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib. So in the book cause cause some of the same people, like there was a colonel could John Alexander who was involved in like exotic, um, you know, sound blasting and all the nonlethal weapons and he's a guy should have on your show actually. Uh, he's incredible guy. Um, so the monastery goats, the book sort of starts funny and gets dark, whereas the movie kind of stayed funny and kind of didn't go into the darkness in that way. How much money they spend on that remote viewing thing for a long, $20 million. $20 million. Is there any one piece of evidence that they could point to that was like, no. Every so often like a unit would get sick of it. Like it was being run by the, um, I dunno the, the DEA or

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       you know, the, the u s army or military intelligence and then it gets sick of it and then they'd dissolve viewing. Right. Is that a dames? Okay. That's not him. No, no. That side of the Games. It's his website. Yeah. He's an older gentleman that it ended up back with the CIA in 1995. CIA's greatest weapon as the power to change your life forever, right? Oh, so now you're using it like, and look, they have a live support Gal. Look, she's pretty too, and need live support calls. Pretty girl. Why don't they have an angry black guy who could beat your ass? Nope. Pretty white girl. It's been funny. It's like welcoming. I'm smiling at you might have beautiful eyes. Do you need live support? Call me sugar. I'll show you how to find your dog. Here's something interesting. You know the guy, the first guy who ran the remote view is back in the very earliest days of remote viewing was a guy called Sydney Gottlieb and he was the same guy who ran mk ultra in the 50s like so all the kind of poisoning people, this sparking people's drinks with LSD going off to Cuba to try to assassinate Castro by putting like a bomb in his cigar or poisoning his wet suit.

Speaker 3:          02:11:44       So of this really dark CIA shit that was happening in the 50s was run by this Guy Sydney Gottlieb, and he was the same guy who run the remote viewers in the 70s I was, that was kind of interesting. That is interesting. Yeah. Well, without a doubt. They've definitely experimented on people to try to find out whether or not they could control them. That's a hundred oh no question. Um, there's a south of oppression. Could artichoke. I became friends with Eric Olsen, who's father was Franco said, who's the guy who purportedly was given LSD by the CIA and then jumped out of a window in New York and killed himself. Do you know that Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard studies on Lsd? Oh really? Yeah. There, there was a German documentary called the net that sort of highlighted this and it was all about his participation in the LSD studies and how it pushed him off the rails.

Speaker 3:          02:12:28       Right. And then he went fucking crazy and went, went off to teach at Berkeley, saved all his money from teaching and then went to live in the woods. And Kendall people too didn't can key CICA is LSD. I do not know if that's the case. I mean he might've been. Um, but uh, the Kaczynski thing is pretty well documented that he was a part of those studies. Right. And, uh, you know, I mean, I have a friend whose sister is out of her fucking mind. She went on a, uh, a couple of LSD trips and took way too much. And to this day, there was like seven years ago. To this day, she's all fucked up. Hmm. So it can happen, especially if you have, if you're mentally unstable to begin with and you get dosed, spiked, you know, it's totally possible. I mean, people that have all of a slippery grip on reality, any really traumatic experience in any real, anything that's like super perturbing to your state of consciousness has the potential to set you off the rails and a way that you might not be able to recover from. I mean, it is possible. And they did a lot of fucking

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       explode at that LSD with people. I know it's worse shit than that. There was this thing called artichoke where they were like experimenting in I, I believe this is all been verified. Their experiment again, in getting people hooked on heroin and then withdrawing the heroin and making them do cold Turkey as a means of getting information out to them. Wow. Yeah. And that was like related to Mk ultra. I mean, yeah. You talked about consent. Conspiracy has been true. I'm couch is a conspiracy. That was true.

Speaker 2:          02:13:58       Yeah. There's plenty of those that are true and when look, especially when you're dealing with the Cold War and this terrible, terrible, terrible thought that the Soviet Union was ready to drop bombs and your children any day of the week and that they're doing things like this. And then, you know, the Nazis had been doing things like this and we know about all the experiments of the Japanese it did and the rape of Nam King and the horrible things that the Nazis had done to the prisoners of war. I mean,

Speaker 1:          02:14:27       I'm weren't, some American didn't m couch S. Dot. Or in the early days of m couches, some Americans were, some American soldiers were kidnapped by the Korean. So then there was seen on TV like Sag, we've announced America and they would try to work out like how the Koreans and my memory's really sketchy on us, but then try to work out like how the Koreans and managed to brainwash these three American servicemen so easily. And that was one of the reasons why they started mk ultra. I might be getting confused.

Speaker 2:          02:14:56       Well, that's one of the reasons why I wanted to ask you about your work with extremest because I always wonder like is it appealing? Like when you're, I mean obviously you're not a white supremacist or an Islamic fundamentalists or anything, but when you're with them for a long period of time, when you're embedded, is there any draw? Is there any, uh, somehow or another, is there any pull towards like thinking and inclination, a, a, is there an attraction to either ideology?

Speaker 1:          02:15:28       I, you know, never to that ideology, but what I did always like, um, like throughout my rights in Korea at the Times I'm, I'm at my happiest times are, I think a story is really working is when something shifts and May, like I spent so much time with conspiracy theorists and then suddenly I'm being chased by the Bilderberg group and I go fucking, that's like, I've become like paranoid. And that's what I know. Like at the bottom of my brain. I know that like what's happening to me is terrifying, but the fact that I've gone through this really big change means it's going to be a really fucking good piece of writing. And that happened in them and it happened in the psychopath test to actually that I became completely drunk with my psychopaths spotting powers. Like I went on a course to learn how to spot psychopaths and I got so drunk with my psychopaths spotting powers that I changed and like my friends were saying to me like, you've really changed Peter Straughan who wrote the screenplay for the metastatic goats told me he was concerned about me because I was so convinced I could spot psychopaths everywhere.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       What do you look for? Um, well, yeah, nuances of language. Um, the first half of my book, the psychopath test sort of teaches people how to spell [inaudible] and then the second half becomes like a cautionary tale to not get so fucking drunk with the power is that it turns you a little bit psychopathic black nuances of language. Um, you know, there's like a 20 point checklist where it all comes from lack of empathy, lack of remorse. I went, I started meeting like CEOs and, and doing the psychopath checklist on them to see if it's true that you're more likely to fund psychopathic at the top of the trees and the bottom. Um, I'll give you one example. Is that true? Yeah, I think that is true. I think you are more likely to find psychopaths it though at the top of the trees and at the bottom because capitalism rewards psychopathic behavior.

Speaker 1:          02:17:17       Well isn't the definition to that? A psychopath is someone that has power or as a sociopath, as someone, like there's some sort of, uh, you know, the whole cyber had sociopath thing. There's a lot of blurry. Yeah. There's a lot of debate out there is to, and different psychiatrists and psychologists will use the terms. Like, I mean, the upshot is that added thickness. Any real difference? Some people will say there's a difference, um, because they'll, they'll bring their own sort of analyses to the situation. But, but in general, you're talking about a kind of a lack of empathy or neurological lack of empathy, whether it's new or logical or whether it's through childhood abuse. That's another big matter of debate amongst those people. But, but I'll give you a kind of classic example from the book. I went to meet this Haitian dictator called toto, constant in jail, in upstate New York.

Speaker 1:          02:18:05       I had met him a few times before, um, but I met him in jail and he kept on saying to me, I want people to like me. Like I really want people to like me captain saying that to me. So finally I said to him, isn't that a weakness? Like wanting people to like you? Isn't that a weakness? And he said, no, no, no, it's not a weakness. Because if you can get people to like you, you can manipulate them to do whatever you want them to do. Whoa. Yeah. So I said, so are you the sort of person who doesn't really feel like empathy? And he said, no. Now empathy is a weakness. So that that's a well, that's clearly telltale that I've, I've, um, I guess he figured, well, fuck it, I'm in jail. It's lots of care out of the bag. I'm not getting out of here.

Speaker 1:          02:18:50       And all cells sometimes they're like, like I said this to an old KGB spy met one time. Like I said, well you were bullied at school. And he said, yes, yes, yes, I was a bully. He said that he was English. He said I would get out from behind a tree and had to have it, like my bag would have bricks ness and I'd hit somebody over the head, which is quite, yeah. And I said, he said, but I'd only get the bullies. I'd only get the police. So I said, and how did you feel about that? And he said, I felt good. And I said, and how do you feel now? Like all these years later, looking back on it, how do you feel now? And he said, I still feel good. And I said, so you're not the sort of person who feels empathy. And he said, you've really got to the nub of what kind of crank Kayam he said, when a dog dies, like one of my dogs dies. I feel incredibly upset our cry. But the human beings that I've hurt and killed don't feel anything. Oh yeah. So if you can get them being honest about their absence of empathy, I don't want to hear that. I mean, I do what I don't

Speaker 2:          02:19:53       do, but I don't want to know. They're around, man. Yeah. Something disturbing about someone who's just not willing to ever join the community. You know, they live amongst you and they're just trying

Speaker 1:          02:20:03       two, yeah. St Montag tray that we see the world in terms of predators and prey. And it would be foolish not to exploit weaknesses at this, you know? I think there really are psychopaths out there. There was some people. Yeah. That's, I think a lot of people that, the one thing I don't like, uh, about this sort of psychopath spot and world is that they, they're not interested to a large extent. And what turns somebody that way because they're just really interested in the idea that this, they're just another species out there. There's just this other species that aren't quite human and they're look human. But then it's kind of like David, I can the Lizard, right? There's people out there who've adopted human form, but they're not quite human. Um, but, uh, but I'm really interested, this is other psychiatrist I met called James Gilligan who basically says all violence is an attempt to replace shame with self esteem. So these people were like so battered, join their childhood, so humiliated, so abused that they'd try and regain some self esteem by committing violence onto other people.

Speaker 2:          02:21:04       Hmm. All violence don't like all. I don't like statements that are so absolutely,

Speaker 1:          02:21:08       it is a big statement, right? But as a, as a kind of humanist, I like that because it's giving some humanity back to violent people. It's saying, you know, this is, you know, it comes from a place of damage. Whereas the psychopath spotters will basically say, no, no, they're just, they're like another species. Yeah. You know what? I think this, honestly, I think there's truth in both camps.

Speaker 2:          02:21:32       Well, I think there's certainly some people that are like that and there's some people that are violence just because they're angry, it's stupidity or they're angry at aggression are there, they just need some release in their life and their, their pent down with all sorts of stress and I can't handle it and they don't have an outlet. You know, there's a lot of people that just, they're lacking an outlet. And I, I liken them to overflowing batteries, like a battery that like I think of the human body as your human body is designed to exert a certain amount of effort to put forth a certain amount of energy during the day. And most people don't even remotely tap into their reserve of energy. They sit down and their body, you know, just conforms to their office chair and they're there all day and at the end of the day they sit in their car or they sit on the bus or the train and they'd make their way home and which case they sit on a couch and they sit in front of the television and their, their body just has constantly up stress

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       and it has this desire to exert energy and it's never met with what it needs. It never, it never has its needs fulfilled, fulfilled. And so then you're in your car and you're in traffic and someone cuts you off and be like, you fucking pay you cash. You have this unbelievably angry response because your, your battery is essentially found there's an opening, you know, it's like a, a hole in a water balloon should water just start squirting out of it. It can't help it. It's like so bent up with or pent up with pressure. And if you, instead of doing that to somebody in another car, who cotton, hey you, if you could then go home and he do it on social media. Everybody haze you, including that person, and it can really damage someone's, well. There's certainly you, you keep coming back to that. It's a, it's ending because it's drama series and books. It's on your mind for awhile. Hey, do monk, do you mind if I go? No, that's a perfect way to end it. This is, this was a great conversation. I really enjoyed it. I'm so glad that we did this because as I say, for years, people have like, oh my God, you gotta go.

Speaker 2:          02:23:29       Well, I think we could have a hundred of these. I mean, anytime you're back, when are you back again? Come around. La in Naafi citizen. Yeah. My son's thinking about moving here, so if it guys, okay, great. If he does, I'm not going to fucking leave. I can't be undone at the city to my son. I hear you. Yeah. Okay. We'll beautiful man. We'll definitely either way, one way or another when you're back in town. Let's do this. Can, I really, really enjoyed it. I really didn't. And so your most recent book is, so you've been publicly shamed it and I'm sure it's available everywhere. Right? Like Amazon and all that jazz, so Barnes and noble, all that good stuff. And uh, John Ronson on Twitter, J o. N a is you're a j. O. H. N that's pretending to be running a bunch of evil shit. You're going to get in trouble for [inaudible] to be me. I hope he's not shaming you. We've tried other is isn't really. Yeah. Oh, ah. Oh yeah, John. So John Ronson, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you brother. I really appreciate Joe's a lot of fun.
