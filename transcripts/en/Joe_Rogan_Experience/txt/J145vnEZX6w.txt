Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Three, two, one knee. Yes. Hello, boy in. Hi there. Welcome. Thank you. Thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it and I love what you're doing. I've seen your Ted Talk. I've seen many in numerous conferences that you've appeared at and discussions you've given on this and for people to jump into this right now, what you've done is think long and hard and devise a method to try to clean up some of the plastic that we have floating around in the ocean. Famously, the Pacific garbage patch is this enormous patch of garbage that's between California and Hawaii. How did you get involved in this and what, what, what? You're a young guy. How old are you? Twenty three. Already. Twenty three already. You sound like, oh my God. How old were you when you started this?

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       Um, I, I think I started thinking about this when I was 16 and I found that this organization when I was 18,

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       that's crazy. All you lazy fucks out there that are 16 years old that aren't doing shit with your life. Just think about this kid. That's amazing. I'm so happy. There's people like you in the world. No, thank you. Yeah. So you started thinking about it when you were 16 and you know, this is something that is extremely disturbing to anybody that's paid attention, especially when you see the birds that have died with all these plastic bottle caps inside their bodies and you know, you see their carcasses with these multicolored caps in them and they thought these things were food. It was just one of the many, many, many problems that occur when you have plastic floating around and just enormous numbers and the ocean.

Speaker 2:          00:01:38       Sure. Yeah. I mean there's really three problems with this plastic. First of all, obviously the ecosystem damage. I think they're right about 800 species that actually could go extinct because of this plastic pollution. And then there's the economic threat in terms of damage to fisheries, damage to tourism and things like that. I think it's around $13 billion dollars a year according to the UN. And then thirdly, there's the health impact or the potential health impact because these tiny plastic pieces, they actually ended up in the fish we eat, uh, that take chemicals with it. And uh, yeah, that ends up on our dinner plate as well.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       So what was it that prompted you to dedicate, essentially dedicate your young life to this?

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       Sure. Yeah. So I've always been very passionate about technology and just building things. I think sort of having an idea in your mind and then seeing that become reality and be able to touch it and things like that. I think, uh, there's literally no better feeling in the world than that. So I've been building my own thing since it was two years old I think for starting with things like tree houses and zip lines, but then going into sort of computers and explosives and rockets and things like that, which was a lot of fun, but it wasn't very useful I would say. Um, so it's kind of looking for something, sort of a, something that real to, to work on a real problem. And that's what I then came across when I was 16 years old, it was scuba diving in Greece and I came across more plastic bags of fish and I wondered why can we just clean this up? And uh, that question sort of kept circling around in my head and um, yeah, I sort of thought about how could we do this. The ocean is pretty big and then eventually came up with there's a dod to use these natural ocean currents, uh, to let us collect the plastic.

Speaker 3:          00:03:26       And so how do you have many different prototypes? Did you started with and you eventually wound up with what you have now and have you started implementing them yet?

Speaker 2:          00:03:36       Oh yeah. I mean, so the, the concept that was presented back in 2012 with my first tedx stoke and if you compare that to where we are right now, it's sort of day and night of a difference. So, um, yeah, through testing and through all these prototypings um, yeah, obviously there has been a lot of development there, but the key idea has stayed the same. That instead of going after the plastic with boats and nets, which will take roundabout 79,000 years to clean up just as great pacific garbage patch. Instead of doing that, we let the plastic come to us. So we use a, basically in network, a fleet of very long floating barriers which are oriented in a u shape and they float around and they kind of act like a massive pacman. So, um, yeah, like a, like a funnel brings the plastic towards it, the network ocean currents push it against, it, moves towards the center, becomes very concentrated and wanted to concentrated well then it's easy to get it out and ship it to land for recycling.

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       It has this started yet, um, so with the past, so we were founded four years ago in that time on one side we did the reconnaissance, so we mapped the patch with 30 boats and an airplane at the same time to really understand how much is out there, which turns out to be one point 8 trillion pieces floating in this great Pacific garbage patch. Uh, and on the other hand, we've done all the testing. So we've done hundreds of scale model tests, we've done prototypes back in Europe on the Nazi and actually right now we're, we're manufacturing the first real cleanup system which is scheduled to be launched from San Francisco to the Great Pacific garbage patch around two or three months time.

Speaker 3:          00:05:19       So has anything been used, like is there a proof of concept of have you done like, real large scale testing where you've shown that you can actually do this?

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       Well, I mean we've done a lot of subsystem testing, so the, the prototypes in the North Sea for example, where there were these 12 meters sections and we managed though to keep that in one piece. So, um, but then also the plastic capturing that worked very well in the lab. Um, but yeah, the, the real, the real proof of course has to come from this one real system in the great pacific garbage patch collecting plastic. And that's what we really hope to achieve this year.

Speaker 3:          00:05:56       So this is the one, right? The Great Pacific

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       garbage patch is the largest. Yes, because cal between California and Hawaii. Hawaiian. Yeah. So the five areas in the world where our plastic concentrates a, this is by far the largest one, therefore others, uh, but they are, they combined Lee a contain less plastic than this one in the, in the nurses. Do we know what it is? Probably because of Asia. So Asia has, uh, has quite a big problem in terms of that they, they use a lot of plastic but they don't have a good infrastructure. So by far the largest source of plastic flowing into the ocean is also this, uh, there's one continent and what's being released, they're naturally by because of the currents ends up in the North Pacific.

Speaker 3:          00:06:38       It's such a strange problem because it wasn't something that was discussed in the eighties and the nineties. It was nothing. And then all of the sudden, somewhere in the year 2000, I remember hearing about the massive amount of plastic we have in the ocean and it just, it just made sense. I was like, oh, well of course, of course it's going to wind up there. But the sheer size of it is staggering.

Speaker 2:          00:06:59       Yeah. And I think that to me the worrying thing is that it's a persistent problem. So with many other kinds of pollution, so when you sort of turn off the tap, it's will be sold by itself. Think about, for example, the, the ozone hole with the cfcs, uh, but with this, like if you turn off the tap, the problem is still there and in 100 years it will still be there. So I think to really solve it, you need to do two things. One site, we have to close the tap. On the other hand, we also need to clean it up.

Speaker 3:          00:07:26       Jamie just pulled up a size comparison where it shows one point 6 million square kilometers of area twice the size of Texas or three times the size of France.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       Yeah. So this is a study we published a few a few weeks ago. So this was the result of the recognizance effort. Um, and it's kind of funny, like every other news outlet used at different size comparison. So I think it was CNN that says, what's the size of Mongolia? Um, we always use Texas. Yeah, Texas is America. We use Texas for everything four times of California as well. So yeah, it's pretty, pretty big area. It's insane. And it's getting bigger, I'm sure. Uh, yeah. So the, the, the area doesn't really change. It's more of the, the concentration concentration of it. When did we realize that this was an issue like collectively scientists, geologists, so there hasn't been that have been sort of small sampling efforts since the seventies. So back then it was the first time plastic was described as being something that floats in the ocean, but it really only entered the public consciousness, I think in the late nineties there was this, uh, this captain Charles Moore who, um, were sort of sailing through it and he saw this plastic and he was like, we need to describe this. And then he did a, a scientific paper on it and yeah. And actually I think he was the one that turned the term great pacific garbage patch. He was riding his boat through it for a long period of time, I guess. Yeah, I think it was, um, it was participating in some sailing race and he went through it and then, yeah, he just saw that. So he was the sort of the canary in the coal mine, I guess. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:08       What is it, one of those things where it's hard to get different governments to act on this because you know, like who's responsible for it?

Speaker 2:          00:09:17       The ocean. Yeah, I think it's a sort of tragic tragedy of the Commons, right? Where it's international waters, sort of everyone's problem, but at the same time legally it's no problem. So, um, yeah, and besides that, what I really felt when I started the ocean cleanup was that I think everyone wanted this problem to be solved, but at the same time we didn't really have a way to do it. There was somebody wasn't any technology to do that and that's why I thought, well perhaps this is an opportunity to combine my interests, have a, solving this problem, but b, also developing technology, which is what we did. Is there anyone else doing this? So there are many organizations working on the, on the prevention insight, right? So educating people, thinking about policies, those kinds of things, which is very important I think. Uh, but uh, yeah, unfortunately we're the only ones that sort of do the technology side of it and yeah, I wish more people would do it. If somebody else would clean the ocean, that'd be fine with us as well. Uh, but until somebody else does it, yeah, we were kind of the ones that have to do.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       That's so fascinating to me that other 7 billion people on the planet sometimes it really does just take one person to, to act one person, do something about something that, I mean I'm aware of many people aware of many people listening have heard about this and that and it's sort of one of those things that's in the back of your mind that doesn't affect you on a daily basis. So you say, well that's a tragedy. That's a terrible thing, but it's not my problem. I have my own problems. But you was one person decided to do something about it. And the fact that you did when you were 16 is so fascinating to me and someone has to do it right, but isn't that weird? Someone has to, but nobody was doing shit until you came along. That's very interesting.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       Yeah. Yeah. I sometimes wonder sometimes people ask me like why, why do you do it? And like the as my answer would be like why not? Why isn't everyone doing it?

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       My one thing that I was thinking was, and this isn't my same feeling about pollution, air pollution, is that once they figured out a way to use whatever's in the particular, it's an air pollution as a resource. Sure. And make it valuable. Then people are going to be running to extract it out of the skies. And I felt the same way about the Pacific garbage patch and all the other ocean currents where they have this issue. So what is it? The currents bring everything together collectively into one area just because of the way the ocean moves.

Speaker 2:          00:11:52       Exactly. So you have these sort of the, the current at the equator and then you have these boundary currents and it sort of acts like the, um, like the sinking your best up. Right? So it's sort of where all the plastic wants to go. Now. Is it possible to take that stuff, all of that Pacif, all those disgusting particles and use it for something? Yeah, I mean, sure. I'm actually a few examples with me. I'm in a bank but not here right now. Grab it. Do you want to go grab it? No, I'll do it a bit. I can describe it. Okay. It's podcasts anyways. So, um, so what we do is we take the plastic out and we um, we recycled that, we've developed a process for this and we can turn it into new products, actually the pair of sunglasses that are finally being able to wear after a dreaded northern European winter.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       They were already made that out of plastic that we took out of the Great Pacific garbage patch. And you're wearing sunglasses that are recycled from the ocean. Exactly. And the idea is that we can do anything with this, right, so you can imagine sort of the part of your next car or your chair or whatever, you can make that out of ocean plastic and what we think is that the material itself isn't valuable enough, but it's really the story behind it. So the fact that you can say, well it's made out of the Great Pacific garbage patch which we think will add value. So it's like the difference between a normal pebble and the piece of the Berlin Wall, it's one is worth shit and the other is worth something. So that's what we kind of want to use as a way to, to then be able to fund the operations of the clinic. I think that's a fantastic idea and I think that'll be a huge value for people.

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       I mean, I think people really want to buy something that they know is recycled out of something that was choking fish and birds to death. Yeah. And not only that, but he does his turning plastic from the ocean into $200 shoes. Sports sportswear maker is teaming up with something to sell three new shoes made with plastic pulled from the ocean. It's like, wow, that's awesome for the kind of stuff you can do. So in this example, so I did, I, she didn't use a plastic from the ocean. They, I think they just said that for marketing reasons, they make that from plastic that sort of, they call it ocean bound. So. Oh, those lie motherfuckers. God dammit. They got them. Yeah. That's bullshit. So it's on the way to the ocean. Yeah. Which I guess is any, could be anything. It was like we were going to throw it up, make sneakers.

Speaker 2:          00:14:22       Right. Oh, that's horrible. Oh, it's still catching venture. Perhaps some of those. Do you have some of those that. They're very cool. I liked, I liked them and I liked the people that work on it and everything, but that's a lie. Yeah. Well yeah, a white light a little bit. Yeah. Um, but uh, yeah, so I mean the composition of the plastic that we'll be pulling out of the ocean is pretty unique. It's a, it's quite degraded because of the decades of UV light heading it, so, so we really had to develop a new process to do this, so probably maybe a year so it will be actually be able to launch the first line of products made out of sort of real the real deal. The plastic actually coming out of the ocean. That's excellent.

Speaker 3:          00:15:07       So you're going to sell like raw plastic and is there an issue of who owns the plastic? I mean even [inaudible] is in the Commons of the ocean in international waters.

Speaker 2:          00:15:17       I think it'd be hilarious if somebody would sort of raise their hand and say, oh, that's my plastic. I put it in there, then we have another kind of legal issue. But if it becomes a resource like oil. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's some, the salvage laws that say if a few sort of salvage something into the shoe oceans, you can actually keep it. So that doesn't appear to be a, an issue. Uh, but yeah, definitely it will be a sort of closing the circle and will be a fun project too. Yeah, I mean it sounds,

Speaker 3:          00:15:50       it sounds like an amazing thing and I guarantee people would be very, very interested to buy things that they know we're made out of something that was really a horrible

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       side effect of civilization. Yeah. I think if you have the choice between a normal. Let's use this sunglass example. Yeah, a normal pair or a pair of coming out of the ocean. I think nine out of 10 people would choose the latter.

Speaker 3:          00:16:14       Oh, for sure. I mean I think it would be giant for companies to, to advertise that we only use 100 percent recycled from the ocean plastic and when exactly that would be gigantic. Now how long do you think it would be before this could be a reality?

Speaker 2:          00:16:28       Um, so the first system it's currently being assembled, so we are renting a former naval base in, at the San Francisco Bay where it's currently being put together. It's still relatively small system. It's 2000 feet in length. So eventually there'll be almost a double the size, but this is, this one will be launched in pretty late June, early July. Uh, then we'll take it out the first, the first deployment will not yet be directly in the patch, so we're just deploying it ran 300 miles of the coast just to make sure that it works well. Sort of a final rehearsal if that goes well then by probably around August we should be ready to take it all the way to the patch and hopefully soon after that, collect the first plastic and then we hope to have the first shipment of first plastic back back in port before the end of the year. And we think that will be such a symbolic moment for, for 60 years, man has been putting plastic into the ocean and from that moment onwards we're also taking it back out again.

Speaker 3:          00:17:29       That's amazing. And you feel like you can get 40 percent of the garbage patch in 10 years.

Speaker 2:          00:17:34       It's actually. So with a fleet of 60 of these cleanup systems, we should be able to clean up half this great pacific garbage patch every five years, which of course the more honorable um, yeah, I mean, and you could get faster if you want more, if you put in more systems. Of course. Where are you guys getting funding from? Um, so so far we've been very generously supported by but mostly individuals actually. So uh, ranging from people that just donate 50 bucks to two people like Marc Benioff, the founder of salesforce and couple of other very high net worth individuals.

Speaker 3:          00:18:09       If someone wanted to donate, how would they do? So

Speaker 2:          00:18:11       yeah, just go to the website, the ocean cleanup.com and feel free to get in touch with us.

Speaker 3:          00:18:17       So mostly individuals, mostly wealthy philanthropists.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       Yeah. So that has gotten us to around 35 to $40,000,000 right now, which has been enough to fund all these years of research and development, the whole mapping of the patch as well as the construction of this first system right now. So, uh, so that should get us to the point where we're sort of proven technology. And then for the scaleup, the idea is that basically any company can, can go and fund their own system. We estimate the cost of every system to be around 5 million. Um, basically you, um, you know, the system will be around a kilometer, that's plenty of space for logos. The world is watching. So it's like this massive billboard floating out there. So, uh, so the idea is that any company can sort of fund or are individual, even

Speaker 3:          00:19:02       some of the racist Nike can be like, fuck you, Adidas were actually doing this for real. Just kidding. Adidas, that will be Hillary. It would be hilarious. So what is the process in taking the plastic from the ocean and converting into usable plastic like that you would use in sunglasses?

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Um, so, uh, the first thing you'd do is you can have your washer do sorted, you scrub it to, to get you so disease, very clean, sort of a fragments of plastic. Uh, then we, uh, we do. There's a process called compounding where you sort of remelted and add some, some additives and make it into what you call pellets. So these are sort of these, uh, beat sized particles which can be fed into any machine in the world. So say an Ikea machine for furniture or tesla machine for, for cars. Um, and um, yeah, so that process we can add to custom develops tailor made for, for our feedstock because it's such a unique composition.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       That's amazing. It's really fascinating because I think that that will be a hugely desirable form of construction. Like if you can prove that the plastic that you use was made and is actually, it's a benefit to, to get that plastic and make things out of it.

Speaker 2:          00:20:24       Yeah, I mean the, it's still more expensive obviously than just normal plastic because we have to collect it from 1200 miles off shore, but on the other hand, so just by selling it as plastic, I don't think that will be a good business, but making it into sort of going further into value chain up to the consumer. I think that can make sense because again, to use the sunglass example, it's probably around a 100 grams of material, uh, so that would take about a maybe a dollar to collect and you know, what's a dollar on the hundred and $20 pair of sunglasses. Right. So, um, so I think that really going at all the way up to, in the value chain, that's where you can really add the value.

Speaker 3:          00:21:09       Well, you know, one of the things that was shocking to me when I was investigating plastic is that I didn't know that plastic you can make plastic out of hemp. The hemp plastic is actually biodegradable.

Speaker 2:          00:21:21       Yeah. And sugar cane. And there's many sort of bio based types of plastic that the thing is though, that there's, this is very, very sort of complicated and controversial world of sort sorted the bioplastics, uh, because you have something called biobased and biodegradable, so you can make plastic out of say sugarcane, uh, which is chemically exactly the same as plastic that it was made from crude oil and it would take the same amount of time for a two degree. So a base doesn't necessarily mean that it's biodegradable and vice versa, so, so it's um, it's a very complicated world that even sometimes her experts on this on plastic pollution being confused about it. So let alone sort of the general population. So uh, and in, in short, there isn't yet sort of the holy grill of this type of plastic that on one hand is very good in terms of performance in a usable life. And then when it, for example, enter the ocean just degrades in, in a matter of days or months. So, uh, but I think that would be, you know, there will be a great innovation.

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       Is the quality of biodegradable plastic inferior to bio based but non biodegradable.

Speaker 2:          00:22:37       Yeah. Or it's. And it's mostly limited in terms of applications so you can really get everything

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       like the actual physical plastic. Does it feel different to the touch it's. Have you?

Speaker 2:          00:22:48       Yeah. So it's, it usually makes more noise. It's more sort of crumbly,

Speaker 3:          00:22:54       so it's brittle or something. Right. Interesting. Well that makes sense. Right? Obviously it's going to. So if you're going to make water bottles out of biodegradable plastic, they're probably going to leak.

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       Yeah, yeah. That's yeah, that. That's not possible yet. So they're compostable. That's another thing. You have compostable plastic, which, which you can use for water bottles, but then the only way for it to degrade who'd be to be in sort of this industrial composter, we have a temperature of 100 degrees and pressure and things like that and it would integrate in the ocean. So it's a. it's a very complicated area.

Speaker 3:          00:23:29       Third had Paul stamets on who's in my colleges and he was talking about all the different fungus that could be potentially engineered to eat plastic. This is another thing that they're working on.

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       Yeah. So that, that

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       of course it would be great to have on landfills and things like sheets. It's a. it's a process that we're also investigating for our recycling because one thing you could do is you could take that plastic and then using either enzymes or indeed fung, fung guy and things like that. You could turn it back into biomass. So from that biomass you could make anything else against it. You could make a bio based plastic, for example. So does this change your relationship with plastic? I mean, when you sit there and you're drinking out of this plastic bottle, do you think I'm going to have to clean this fucking thing up someday?

Speaker 2:          00:24:19       Yeah, I, yeah, but on the Ariana and also not against plastic because I realized that without plastic, say modern medicine will be very difficult. That plastic lot more food waste would be produced and without plastic we wouldn't be able to clean the ocean. Big Ocean actually a lot of the components of our cleanup system actually. Maybe we can pull up an image of the thing being built right now. Um, so that's actually a lot of the parts of that are made out of plastic. So, um, so, so it's kind of ironic. It's poetic embolism. Yeah. Here it is very far. Solving fire with fire. So yes, I don't think we can live without plastic and I don't think we should want to. I think it's really just about managing the material in a way that it doesn't end up in the ocean, which means that it ed comes back to the material being valuable enough at the end of life because if, if it's cheaper to recycle than to not recycle will, then obviously it would happen and there needs to be good infrastructure for that. And then I think as a final, sort of a final safety net, we need technologies like this to sort of intercepted in river mouths as well as sort of clean up the legacy of the 60 years that we're having in the middle of the ocean. But I don't think we can live with that place.

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       No, I don't think so. Either. Not yet. And are when you're looking at the water and you see the plastic that is in this Pacific garbage patch on the other, the other four patches, how deep does that plastic go from the surface?

Speaker 2:          00:25:54       Um, so for most of the plastic really stays on our near the surface. So we've, we've done expedition student for that too to measure it. And that's actually why our system only goes three meters deep because that's so below that, there's virtually no plastic anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       Interesting. So it was only about nine feet. So when your, when your trunk, when you see the little tiny itty bitty pieces, it seems like as the plastic breaks down over decades, it becomes like almost like a gelatinous sort of chunky thing.

Speaker 2:          00:26:26       It's called microplastics are. You've sort of these particles that look a bit almost like grains of sand, right? Uh, which are sort of really small. Even those we measured our primarily in those top three meters or nine feet in. Um, so, and, and another surprising finding, I think from, from those explanations, was that still more than 99 percent of the plastic is larger than a millimeter. So larger than those, those very tiny pieces, which means that on one hand, I think that's good news because that means it's not too late because obviously the smaller to get the more harmful they get a, they end up in the food chain, but they also are harder to clean up. Right? So, uh, so it's 100, it's not too late. So it's the good, the good news I think, but on the other hand, it also means that there's still 99 percent of a plastic out there that, uh, over the next few decades will become microplastics as well if we don't clean it up. So there's sort of this ticking time bomb out there that um, you know, if we just leave it there, the amount of microplastics could increase over a hundred fold over the next few decades and then we will be in a, in a, in March,

Speaker 1:          00:27:37       worse situation than we are today. So have marine biologists done studies on the impact in that particular area in terms of populations of fish and marine life?

Speaker 2:          00:27:47       Uh, yeah. So, so there's many species that are being affected on one side due to ingestion on the, on the other side through entanglement. So actually another finding of our study was that almost half of the plastic by mass is things like ropes and fishing nets, which of course disastrous. Well first of all, four propellers for, for boats that go out.

Speaker 1:          00:28:11       Oh, photo indeed. So arena, terrible photo of a, a turtle that, I mean it looks like it's caught in a bush, it's just this massive net that this thing is swimming around with this thing attached to his body. That's one of the things that I was going to ask you about is cleaning up the nets because uh, we had talked to someone who was explaining that every time they fish, a lot of times they'll cut the nets lose. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:39       So it's probably a combination of accidental loss and intentional lots. But yeah, I mean this amount of net really was quite, quite staggering.

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       And did you, do you remember who was bringing that up, Jamie? Somebody. Somebody brought that up that they just released the nets and that it's commonplace and it was stunning because we were like, what? Every time they do that, yeah, the netscape cut in, they get damaged so they just cut the nets loose and the nets are plastic too. So. But that's insane that that's legal, that they do that, that they don't have. Yeah. It's not Lego, but it's not really legal. No. But they're lost for this. But obviously, how do you know that people do that? It's very hard to, to monitor the middle of the ocean. Yeah, I mean I guess you should probably have some sort of a gps tracking on your net.

Speaker 2:          00:29:27       Yeah, I mean that could be one thing. Or You could think about a need market based solutions where there will be a financial incentive if they bring their nets. Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:29:37       Yeah. In some sort of a penalization if they don't. What is this Jamie? The impact and abandoned ocean fishing nets on marine life. Chris Ryan or Duncan. Oh, okay. That makes sense. Google says, Oh man, that is just so. It's so sad that it's such a wasteful, dismissive sort of thing to do. Just cut it loose and it's gone. It's in the ocean. No worries.

Speaker 2:          00:30:04       Sure. So that's, I mean that's a very obvious kind of impact. And then another thing that was also a study done recently, so we looked at the, the concentrations of plastic versus naturally occurring the marine life in this garbage patch. And then what we saw was that there is 180 times more plastic at the surface. Then sort of natural food for birds and turtles and things like that. So you can imagine if you are a turtle at the surface of this garbage patch and you sort of take a bite to eat, there's 180 times larger chance that you eat plastic rather than a piece of plankton. Right? Um, and what we found was that this concentration is so high that it connection. You have this chemical impact, uh, where um, yeah, where these chemicals have a potential health impact on these organisms as well as um, a species further up the food food web, including US humans.

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       So have we noticed that? Have people been tested and shown to have ingested plastic that they've gotten through eating tuna or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       So the plastic itself isn't the thing that chemicals, chemicals that are attached to the plastic. And for example you see is that, for example, in Greenland, like the native communities that really rely on fish, they have much higher cancer rates. They have a much higher concentrations of mercury, other heavy metals as well as these persistent organic pollutants. He thinks that attached to the press, to the plastic in Greenland. Yeah, like the, like these sort of these native communities that rely on fish and other sea life

Speaker 1:          00:31:47       there to eat. This is a recent trend that they have higher rates of cancer.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       Um, yeah. I don't know how recent it is, but the past few decades I can imagine. But yeah, that's really linked to their, their marine, uh, the consumption of marine sources. But um, you know, obviously it's hard to say well how many percent of that is just heavy metals. Yeah. For as far as what's coming by plastic. But sure, if you, um, if you look at the kind of chemicals and you look at the lab tests that they've done with that, those chemicals. Yeah. They are not very good for you.

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       No, I've heard that if you leave a water bottle like this in your car and it gets hot out, that the water will, a plastic will leach into the water. So. Correct.

Speaker 2:          00:32:32       Yeah. So I think it depends on the kind of plastic, but you have, I think with this prayer, the liner would contain salads and things like that. So, um, yeah, I wouldn't do that. Um, so there's, you know, when you look at this chemicals you have, you have two kinds of things you should I think worry about. One is the chemicals that are actually in the plastic and secondly there's these chemicals that just float around in the ocean and then can attach to the plastic, uh, when they, um, because they sort of act like this chemical sponge, the plastic wants to repel water and those chemicals too. So they kind of act like a magnet towards each other. Um, and especially the latter one is well studied and we see that a lot on the, on the, on, on the plastic. Uh, but the, the former one, yeah, it's even an issue here. If in your car, for example, it's an issue in your car, like also. Yeah. Well if you leave it like in a hot car and. Right, right. Right.

Speaker 3:          00:33:26       Now the question was, is even if you're scooping out all that plastic out of the ocean, is it still leaving chemicals that will, will never be able to get up?

Speaker 2:          00:33:39       Um, so I think the chemicals mostly actually it, it collects more chemicals than it sort of leaches out. So, uh, because of those, those sort of legacy chemicals like the, the pcbs and ddt sort of things that we use for a insulators. And I'm a pesticide spec in the maybe the forties to sixties. So these, um, these actually, um, uh, the, the plastic attracts those chemicals. So, uh, in a way you kind of also remove a bit of those chemicals and we actually have to wash them out before we do the recycling because you don't want those in your,

Speaker 3:          00:34:17       your products. So there's actually some sort of a benefit to having those plastics in the water. I mean, not that you would encourage people to put in the water, but there is some, some natural benefit.

Speaker 2:          00:34:26       Um, yeah, I mean it's sort of. Yeah, I mean I, I cannot really say how many percent of those legacy chemicals we would be pulling out with the plastic, but yeah, I mean you could say, you could argue it's sort of an added benefit to removing it. Not sure having plastic in here

Speaker 3:          00:34:44       now have you extended this line of thinking to some of the other problems in the ocean, like these heavy metals?

Speaker 2:          00:34:50       Um, well, so I really hope is that the cleanup can sort of become a symbol of how we should use or how we should use technology to solve problems of our time. So when you, um, and I think a lot of it comes down to that we shouldn't sort of protest what we shouldn't agree with it, but we should build the things we should build a future that we do agree with. Um, so when you look at the past few hundred years of modernity in our civilization, what we see is dramatic positive trends in terms of health, wealth, education, violence, and we had steven pinker on your show, right? Um, so I think that's really, really positive trends. We've done a good job in that. And that all comes down to our ability to sort of imagine things that don't exist yet. So it was sort of technology and innovation and being able to work, uh, work together in an effective way, which is think about the corporation.

Speaker 2:          00:35:55       Um, so, so I think those have been, um, sort of very good trends and I think what we should do is we should also think about how to apply those to the area outside of our own species and to the rest of the environment because when you look at all those positive trends over the past few hundred years, um, and then yeah, that's all good. But there's one very big exception which is the impact to the environment. It's almost like we've had all the success at the cost of the environment and, but I think that instead of there's some people that have sort of a more reactionary field to this and they say, well, look at all these problems. It was created by businesses and by technology. So we should stay as far away from those things as possible. And I think that's sort of, um, you know, that's sort of stupid.

Speaker 2:          00:36:46       I think that it really just shows that these are very powerful ways of getting things done and I think a much more effective way was to sort of apply that what has worked in other areas and then also apply that to the area of the environment. So, so I don't think, you know, I, for example, think that the, the car problem is not going to be solved by bending cars I think is going to be sold, but electric cars and I don't think the, the, the pollution problem is going to be solved by everyone becoming Vegan. I think it's going to be solved by things like lab grown meat and other kinds of alternatives. Um, so, and that's why I also think that, um, yeah, the ocean cleanup or the plastic pollution problem is not going to be solved by sort of people trying to do their own little bits. And I'm trying to live without plastic or things like that I think is going to be solved by, um, you know, things like plastics that do not harm to the environment as well as technologies like the ocean cleanup to sort of clean up after itself. So, um, yeah, and I hope that there can be a sort of a symbol of that approach.

Speaker 3:          00:37:53       I like what you just said there because I, I've always thought that technology will most likely sort out most of these issues if we apply enough attention to it and that one of the real issues is when someone creates some sort of a new technology, they really don't have the ability to see 50 years down the line what's going to happen with the side effects, the residual effects. And I think that's a big part of what happened with plastic. And I don't think the solution is, you know, making an accent of a piece of rock and living in the woods. I think that the solution is trying to have a long term comprehensive approach to how we use various technologies and also various resources so that we don't have another pacific garbage patch and some new technology 5,100, 200 years from now. I mean if you went to the ocean 200 years ago, you'd see none of this. So this is a very, very, very recent issue that's compounding at a staggering rate.

Speaker 2:          00:38:53       Sure. Yeah. I agree with what you say there and it's. Yeah, it's, it's really just about, uh, so I don't think. I think there's other people that think that technology is inherently neutral. It's not good or bad, but I think that's not true. If you compare, I know some bio terrorist weapon which you could event or you could invent a machine to clean the ocean, I would say I would argue those are not equally a good things to, to develop. So when technology isn't a inheriting neutral means it's sort of deterministic. So the inventor kind of puts a certain direction in the product already and I think that can be used in our advantage or to phrase it differently. I think there is a responsibility at with inventors and entrepreneurs to build things that are more good than bad and actually plastic. I would still argue that plastic is a net positive technology and it was invented as a solution.

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       Uh, it saves a lot of weights, a lot of people got hurt when, when people use glass bottles and things like that. So back in the day this was invented as a, as a solution, but it has this negative side effects. And then I think we should now think about, well, what technologies can we develop to manage that negative side effect? And probably those have again, a small negative side effect, but you can think about it like a compounding sort of staircase of, um, of net positive technologies. I think eventually that's how we can actually solve this problem.

Speaker 3:          00:40:27       So in this country there's a tremendous amount of recycling, but how effective is that recycling?

Speaker 2:          00:40:34       Yeah. I think the amount of recycling is actually pretty low in the, in the US compared to other countries that can do everything better over here. Yeah. I've noticed that. What countries the best at it, I think like Germany or Switzerland, that this kind of country that really are. And what do they do differently? Um, they just think they just put more money in it and I think most of the waste and the US is actually being landfilled. So, and what's used to be recycled actually was sent to China. But now like I think this year or last year, China said, well, no, we don't want your waste anymore. So, uh, so now I think there will be a lot of investments in new recycling facilities in the US.

Speaker 3:          00:41:17       Now how does that get recycled save? You use this water bottle and you empty and then you throw it into the recycle container. What happens?

Speaker 2:          00:41:26       Um, so yeah, I mean very much depends on the location, but I'm to just use an example, um, of where I live in, back in Holland. Uh, so they, um, they, you actually, they collect the plastic separately. Then it goes to a facility where they sort the different kinds of plastic, they get out all the contaminants and uh, make that into two new pellets. And the problem there is really the, um, the lack of demand for recycled plastic because I think a lot of companies that, yeah, that build products because basically virgin, so new plastic is so cheap, they'd rather just do what they're used to and I'm not, they don't want to see any risks with their materials. So they just choose for the safe option, the, the new kinds of plastics. So I think if you want to do, if you want to promote recycling, uh, I would actually say well promotes the use of recycled material because as long as there's a demand then the price will go up and then automatically more recycling what would happen.

Speaker 3:          00:42:31       Yeah. There's very little demand for recycled plastic. Look, it's not something that you hear about on a regular basis. Like people that are clamoring to get only recycled plastic.

Speaker 2:          00:42:39       Yeah. And I think that, I think maybe that's, um, that could be another nice side effect of what we do because we can kind of make this sort of recycled plastic a bit more sexy. Perfect word. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:42:54       Yeah. I think that's exactly what it is. Have you extended this line of thinking to other environmental concerns like pollution in terms of chemical spills and pollution in the air and things along those lines?

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       Yeah. I have quite a few more ideas I would say, but yeah, I would really, really wouldn't be good for the ocean cleanup if I would get distracted.

Speaker 3:          00:43:19       Well, I want you to farm those ideas to other people because I think guys like you are insanely valuable. Like that one person really did sort of germinate the seed and get this project moving. It's very unusual. Outliers like yourself, very humble guy. I'm sure you don't think of yourself in an outlier, but you most certainly are. It's one of the most valuable things about civilizations, the occasional person who steps out amongst the masses and does something pretty radical that almost everybody around them was aware it was an issue. And that's what you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:43:51       Yeah. I think there could be much more people that do things like that.

Speaker 3:          00:43:55       Yeah, I think I would think so. But I don't see it. That's what it's so fascinating about guys, Iq is that this is not a very common thing to do, but it's a very common problem.

Speaker 2:          00:44:06       Yeah. Well maybe that's because when you hear about people doing cool, cool shit, it's usually when they're already sort of doing those things and it's not. When they kind of started thinking about this, so then I guess people can be intimidated. Like how. I don't know how to run a company of 100 people. I didn't know how to uh, how to get these things done. But when I looked back at myself four or five years ago, I really didn't have a bloody clue what I was doing. What you were a baby. Yeah, exactly. Five years ago or 18. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah. That's a baby I wasn't even born yet. No. So, so, but that really doesn't matter. I mean it sits about just getting started. Sure. And being willing to learn and just being open to feedback and just trying many different things and seeing what works and what doesn't work, especially at the beginning of done hundreds of things that didn't work the first time I tried a fundraising.

Speaker 2:          00:45:11       I send a cold email to 300 companies and ask to ask for sponsorship. And I think one replied and said, this is a horrible idea. You should go back to school. Um, so that wasn't heard. That one. Yeah. Put that one on your wall. I will do that. It's a good idea. Um, so. So that was very successful. And then I tried crowdfunding and raise a few million bucks and allowed us to get started. So isn't that amazing? Yeah. So it's just about sort of doing this trial and error. So just like we developed a technology in a very iterative fashion. It's also about developing yourself, I think in a, in an iterative fashion and sort of just just get started.

Speaker 3:          00:45:48       Well, what my point being is that when someone like you does make something happen and once you get the ball rolling, you can be a catalyst for so many other projects getting launched because it's attached to you like you're a person, like you've got the fire, okay, you've got the fire, so you put the fire over here. Now this fire will start here. Let me bring an end to this, this project, this can start and it seems to me that getting that fire, getting that initial ember is one of the most difficult aspects and creating any sort of technology in terms, especially in terms of something so complex where you're extracting things that are potentially dangerous from the environment and creating a net positive effect and then using that plastic to recycle. There's so much good Karma, for lack of a better word, attached to something like that. And, and for a person like me, when I hear that your sunglasses are made from the Pacific garbage patch, I get excited. I'm like, Oh, where can I buy these fucking sunglasses next year? Yeah, well I'll buy him that, but that, that does get exciting to be bold. So it seems to me that this excitement that you're bringing is contagious and you could potentially use it to spread other ideas that could also be environmentally positive.

Speaker 2:          00:47:04       Yeah. Well I certainly hope that our people will think about sort of what kind of the ocean cleanup can I built, which isn't cleaning plastic from the ocean. So I hope people sort of already do that. Um, but yeah, I mean it's a good, good point. I should sort of think about sort of what to do with these other ideas. Like yeah, a few of them are sort of thought about that I kind of want to do myself eventually, uh, which would not be in the next few years, but burning. Yeah. Do you have like a long

Speaker 3:          00:47:34       term plan for other stuff? What are you going to do if you, the oceans are all beautiful and blue, you're like, shit,

Speaker 2:          00:47:41       I mean what do I do? And the goal is really to help ourselves out of business. Right? So one day we hope we're done. I don't want to be the garbage man of the ocean forever, sort of not the best title anyway. Um, so, so the, I think we did target that we set for the ocean cleanup bulls to really get to a 90 percent reduction by by 2040, which is incredible, which I think is achievable both on the influx side and the stock side. Um, but yeah, so, but I think that already before that, I think maybe five years from now it will just be sort of a steady operation. And then for me it wouldn't be very exciting anymore. It's, I would be involved until really the end, but maybe, yeah, maybe at some point in time I will be able to, um, to sort of broaden my time over multiple project.

Speaker 2:          00:48:37       But that's, yeah, that's at least years away, um, because yeah, of course there's still a lot of things that need to happen. We need to first prove the technology first and foremost this year. Uh, then we have to scale up, um, you know, raise hundreds of millions to build this entire fleet out. Uh, then therefore more patches in the world. We need to make it into a self sustainable business and then we also need to think about what can we do on the source side. So, so there's quite a few pieces of the puzzle is still there to be a to be found and put together. Um, yeah. So I won't be bored for the next few years for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       You certainly won't be one of the reasons why I'm asking this about you and what your ideas are with cleaning up other problems in the world as because there's millions of people listening to this and there might be another boy in out there who's a young kid who says, well, why don't we do this or how come this hasn't been done or why, why hasn't someone tried this? And next thing you know, someone who's figuring out how to extract heavy metals out of the bottom of the ocean. Sure,

Speaker 2:          00:49:43       sure. I think the thing that will be will be great and yeah, I'd definitely welcome people to sort of just to start and um, yeah. What kind of other thoughts? Well, I think another thing that's important then when people try and solve problems is that they actually think about how to solve the problem. I think there's a lot of people that are very, um, yeah, very well meaning and they want to get involved. But then what happens is that they sort of think about it so at least I can kind of make a dent and then hopefully that dense sort of grows. But I think what's, what a lot of people forget to do is that when they sort of start tackling a problem, they forget, sort of look at the whole problem with first and see what sort of, what's required to actually solve the whole problem.

Speaker 2:          00:50:33       And then I'm sort of reason your way back to, well, what's the first step that I need to take? Because if you don't do that well then I think it will be very hard to kind of get the scale you need to actually sort of solve, solve the problem. Um, so, and it's, yeah, I can imagine, can be quite intimidating to think about that. But um, yeah, I think that would get us to much more sort of effective solutions to sort of this sort of top down problem solving as I would call it instead of sort of bottom up some problem solving.

Speaker 3:          00:51:06       So when have you talked to anybody that also had an idea of how to clean up the Pacific garbage patch?

Speaker 2:          00:51:15       Now I've read about other proposals from the past for sure.

Speaker 3:          00:51:19       But no one is really actively pursued anything.

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       Um, so I didn't know. But the thing is of course all those other ideas were based on sort of boats and nets that would go fishing plastic taking 79,000 years for, for just one. Pat.

Speaker 3:          00:51:34       She, there was one that I saw that looked like some gigantic floating thing. It looked like a spaceship and he was kinda like moving across the surface, sort of skimming it. Is that one of those

Speaker 2:          00:51:46       see actually the, some artist's impression of one of our earlier concept. I think that's probably what it was. That was. Yeah, that was ours.

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       What other, I mean, if you don't mind talking about them and what other ideas have you had in terms of like cleaning things up?

Speaker 2:          00:52:04       Yeah, I'm kind of hesitant to joke about them, but I mean there's plenty of other problems out there. So if you just think about sort of what are their big problems are out there. How about water pollution? Um, yeah, I usually what I do is like she, I try and actively forced these ideas out of my head just because sort of once you have an idea it sort of starts to grow and then sometimes you know, with, with any project you're doing there, there are these weeks that things don't go very well and sort of everything seems to be against you. And in those weeks though, it's very tempting to start thinking about well at this other idea and you know, and sort of starts to grow and you should be careful that it doesn't take over your entire month. So I don't know what you're saying too.

Speaker 2:          00:52:51       Scattered and spread out. Yeah. So I think it's of paramount importance for the, this, for the Azure team to happen is that I stay 100 percent focused on what we do if there's one mission rid the oceans of plastic and that's what we're doing. So what I usually do is I sort of write them down in my notebook and keep it next to my bed and that's where it stays until maybe a few years from now. So probably when you were to ask me what's the top three ideas, other ideas that you have, I wouldn't be able to, wouldn't even be able to say them because yeah, they're sort of out of my hand and then I really tried to keep it there. Um, but, um, I mean, what's, what I can say is that they're all sort of technology based. So they're all things that are possible now, but I want to make possible in the future and there are sort of all connected in terms of negative side effects of, yeah, of civilization.

Speaker 2:          00:53:49       And trying to sort of make sure that that doesn't backfire to us. What I always like to do is I try to think like if we sort of try to imagine a future in 10,000 years from now, um, how do we make sure that civilization is there, but, you know, zooming out, humanity's still there as zooming further out, just general life can, can prosper and yeah, when I look at if I tried to extrapolate the current situation to the next 10,000 years, I don't think we're at that point yet, but I think it's um, yeah, it's a challenge that we'll have to sue so.

Speaker 1:          00:54:31       Well, it's certainly a challenge that we're going to have to solve and challenge that I would hope more people like you tackle and start approaching these issues with the sort of 10,000 year mindset. I'm a big one, of course with the ocean is overfishing.

Speaker 2:          00:54:48       Yeah, for sure. Um, yeah. I mean, one thing say retinue of credit, of excitement and a lot of startups in the area of, of artificial meat, right? Yeah. Why not artificial fish, fish meat, right? Because there seems to be this natural evolution from sort of wild hunting to farming to sort of this more a lab grown stuff that doesn't involve killing or a, all these resources being wasted and on land were kind of in Stage two now is they're going to stage three protein next few decades. But if you look at phishing, it's still just hunting, right? So it's still just wildcard. Most, most, most fish,

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       there's some farm raised, but it's also fun to be not as valuable or as healthy.

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       Yeah. And I think they also use a lot of wild caught fish as a feedstock for these farmed fish. So that's kind of odd. But yeah, but that seems to be served as mentor evolution. So I think that would be a way to, to kind of solve that. Um, and m.

Speaker 1:          00:55:59       But isn't there a potential. I mean, if we're looking at this in terms of longterm of what we've done with plastic and the downside, there's potential downsides to even this lab grown stuff. Like we don't know really the health consequences of consuming it yet. We don't know what the side effects are. We don't know what sort of byproducts are created in manufacturing this stuff. Yeah. Um, possibly and we need to

Speaker 2:          00:56:25       look carefully at this. Uh, but I think a decent paper does have a lot of potential of being able to do more with less.

Speaker 1:          00:56:32       Yeah. I'm going to wait for awhile. Yeah. I just want, I just, I don't know, it just seems to me like, boy, this could be one of those early adopter things. It could be A.

Speaker 2:          00:56:43       Yeah, disaster. Yeah. Well, yeah, yeah, I show that dude. Good testing there.

Speaker 1:          00:56:50       I'm sure they do too. I mean, I'm, I'm sure I'm just ignorant, but I'm still paranoid. I would just go, what are you doing? What's going on? How'd you make that? You made it out in the lab. Okay, good luck eaten it. I'll be over here.

Speaker 2:          00:57:03       I mean, it's funny how thinks sort of, um, it's, something's just take a lot of time to sort of get used to another thing sort of once it's, it's there. You kind of used to it in a second. The example, like earlier this week I was driving a, um, a, a tesla on, on autopilot. And as driving it for five minutes and then already you're kind of doing your emails and then when you take it off, it just feels like you're back in the stone ages when you're just kind of have to drive this yourself. It's so weird. So, so you, you do your

Speaker 1:          00:57:39       email while you're driving, you're not even paying attention to the machine and make sure that it doesn't hit some homeless lady who steps out off the median, like say this did happen over a car.

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       Yeah, I mean I think this things like this will come up more rapidly than people think and I think people will be very, very quickly that we'll use to it.

Speaker 1:          00:58:03       But aren't you? You're supposed to like look at the road. Right? And that's supposed to be staring down at your laptop. Yeah. Okay. I just erase everything I said for the past minute or two. Have you ever seen the video of the guy is falling asleep and San Francisco traffic now he's completely asleep. He's behind the wheel that tesla like this and the car's slowing and going with the pace of traffic. It's really fascinating because this happened so quickly. I remember a buddy of mine got a tesla a couple years ago and he's like, dude, I can let my hands off the wheel on the highway. I'm like, really? Like, that's happening already, but it's not just happening like people plug into their navigate here. This guy look at him. This guy is stone dead asleep in his tesla in bumper to bumper San Francisco traffic and the car is performing flawlessly and hurt their business.

Speaker 2:          00:58:51       This Dutch guy actually just went to the back office, like on the back seat and started changing his clothes and. Oh God. Yeah, and then apparently that they now included the safety feature that you kind of have to touch the wheel every minute of it.

Speaker 1:          00:59:03       Oh, that's a new thing. Yeah. BMW, I believe, has a similar system, but you have to have your hand on the wheel at all times. Yeah. It's pretty better until it's flawless. It's. Yeah. Yeah. I would imagine. Yeah. People probably do and all kinds of freaky shit in their cars while this thing is on autopilot, it's really don't. Yeah. Yeah. It's quite amazing how, I mean there's. You're just about to show a video of Tesla autopilot crash compilations, saving people from crashes is what it's. Oh yeah. Oh, I'm sure it does. What's unbelievable is how few crashes there are and they said they'd been two fatalities so far. Okay. How many fatalities per capita versus non autopilot cars? I mean, I would imagine it's far less.

Speaker 2:          00:59:48       Yeah. Obviously these cars are also just safer in general, so they're not much safer than a 19 nineties Toyota Corolla or something. So in terms of the way the construction. Yeah, just safer when they crashed, so I didn't know how they compared the sisters statistics, but yeah, I, I'm, I'm very impressed too. It was fun trying it out.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       Yeah, I'm impressed and I'm very hopeful. The only, my only concern I had my friend Matt Farah was on last week and he's a car expert and they've actually started an organization to save human driving there. They're literally going to be like lobbyists to, to stop. It doesn't get Ben. Yeah. Well, that's the concern is that one day they're going to say you cannot drive your own car, and they're really worried that. What was the name of his organization? Do you remember? Okay. So, but the, the, you know, they're very serious. He's like, it's going to happen quicker than you think you're going. It's going to be very difficult to drive your own car and then it's going to be illegal.

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       Yeah. Maybe they should keep areas like the highway one or anything like that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       Just something, some freaky road or people can get crazy. Look, man, I'm steering. I'm hitting my own brakes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, again, these are things that it's most likely inevitable. I mean, this, this technology, the way it's progressing, it's going to be safer. It's going to be healthier, lower emissions. All these variables that are going to come into play where people are gonna say no, there's just the benefit of driving your own car is not worth the detriment to society.

Speaker 2:          01:01:21       Yeah. And next to that, uh, just if you think about the normal rate of converting the entire car fleet to electric, it would be around 20 years because that's sort of how long cars last and you only produce a few hundred million cars a year and there's billions of cars. So, um, so, you know, if you don't want that to take 20 years, well I think autonomy than really has to come into play because if you have autonomous cars, you need much less cars out there than you would if you would have to drive themselves because obviously cars are just driving maybe three percent of their time, their time, they're just being parked so they can drive themselves. I think the utilization of the number of cars will be much higher. And um, I think that whole transition to electric cars would happen much faster.

Speaker 1:          01:02:10       It's a human driving or association, a Human Driving Association is what it is here. Pull it, pull it back up again so you can.

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       Got It.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Yeah. The war on driving is here. A little paranoid. They're a little paranoid, but you gotta remember Matt Farah is a, an automotive journalist, so his livelihood depends on talking about cars and he's a real legitimate car. What does this wrong answer? What does that pick? The electric car. Oh, you clicked. It says wrong answer. You go there. It takes you to their shop. Well, why is this a shame? Oh, I get it. That's just a joke. Why would it be the wrong answer? It's just an an answer. Do you drive? Do you drive an electric car? A regular car? Actually, I don't have a car. You don't know. And why don't you ever read any cars? You just have a. have a bike, but it's fucking freezing there. Yeah, the coat drive. Wow. Okay. Hardcore. Listen, I'm a big fan of Holland because a kickbox.

Speaker 1:          01:03:12       So you guys have some of the greatest kickboxers of all times came from this one small place. It's very unusual. No. Why is that? I have no idea. Yeah. We just have to punch people. I guess when you did cut you off at the Carthage. Oh, is that what it is? But Holland is a very unique place, isn't it? I mean it's a, it's a very unusual country. I mean, yeah, sometimes people wonder why do you think this is based on Hollander is there came out of Holland and for us it makes a lot of sense and that we live below sea level. So we're like, we have pray per capita the highest number of hydraulic engineers and maritime engineers' blessing. So it's just very good access to human capital and um, yeah, so, so pretty makes sense for us to be there as an option for engineering companies that support us and are involved with us contractors.

Speaker 1:          01:04:12       Uh, so. So for us it's not pretty very strange, but I don't know about the other things. There's quite a lot of innovation coming from such a small country. Yeah, a lot of innovation and really unique, intelligent people. I've met a lot of people from Holland and they just really fascinating people. Wim Hof. Wim. Yeah. I've never met him, but fucking guys the best. And so lovely. He's just such an amazing person. Every time you're around them you're like, feel better. Like somebody like some coffee. Oh, I know. He's just, he's very contagious and I mean I have, I have quite a few friends from Holland. You could check your watch. You got to take off soon. Right. So fuck you. Okay. Um, it's just, uh, I am fascinated how, how variable people are and how these cultures like Holland sort of arise and I just find so many people from Holland to be. I'm waiting to meet assholes from Holland. I'm sure you must have them, but they do it this, they take from that with the people that I've met from Holland or friendly and happy. It's a very unusual place. Yeah, no, sure. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       I, I mean, I, I kind of feel the same way about the US west coast as well. Um, it's just, um, yeah, I mean I'd definitely be able to live in a place like San Francisco maybe just because of the. Yeah, the high priest, the high percentage of engineers and entrepreneurs that kind of makes me feel at home. But, uh, no, but I mean us in general, I feel like, um, yeah, the people are very friendly.

Speaker 1:          01:05:44       I can tell you some, some spots that suck. Okay. There's a few spots. It's like, yeah, you're in a good spot right here and San Francisco is a fantastic spot in terms of innovation, how well has this been received in, in America and particularly in California. I mean obviously you're here to do some business and talk to some people. Is this something that people are very excited about and you feel like there's a lot of momentum behind it?

Speaker 2:          01:06:08       Actually us, the, the number one group of supporters for us because we know we fucked up a lot with the ocean and it's right there. Maybe that's your target, but no, just I think people are very um, yeah, very supportive. But maybe it's also because the geography of the patch, it's right between two US states like Canada but different. Um, so yeah, so it's um, yeah, I think we've received a lot of support from the US. Um, I think that our biggest support group is from here and like everyone I talk to here they really want to get into. So yeah, I think the, um, yeah, we're kind of lucky that it's next to the US.

Speaker 1:          01:06:53       Yes. So you've raised all this money, is this going to be a profitable business?

Speaker 2:          01:06:59       Actually, so we're a non for profit entity, so a, we're not even allowed to make profit, but eventually the idea is that this sort of, this plastic business would be sort of a separate thing and that would then create the funding for the cleanup. So everything would be reinvested in the cleanup.

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       Oh, that's fantastic. So do you have a name for the plastic business?

Speaker 2:          01:07:22       Uh, no. Uh, right now it's just under the ocean cleanup still we'll, we'll, we're actually thinking about some kind of brand name, but it's the next year.

Speaker 1:          01:07:29       Yeah, please let me know. I mean we'll promote the hell out of that. I think that's a fantastic idea. And I'll try to buy as many things out of ocean plastic as they can sell deal, I think. Yeah, I mean think the more things you can buy, maybe plastic sale. Get this guy, you know that phone. Where are you buddy that makes these, it's a guy carves all these himself and then makes these molds and then hand paints all of these. Wow. Yeah. He's a little wizard. I don't know. He's just, he's a wizard. He's a big wizard. If it's is actual size or me now I'm a little taller than me, but uh, my head's not that big either, but yeah, these things are uh, I mean to have a line made out of completely out of ocean plastic would be amazing. Maybe he'll do a Boyan version.

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       That'd be creepy. Creepy, creepy looking at me over there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a weird phase two. But um, yeah, I mean there's, there's really the sky's the limit in terms of applications of your plastic and uh, and again, I fist think it'd be so attractive to people. I mean, especially out here, California, at least posing as being environmentally conscious. There's a lot of environmentally conscious posers out here for sure. I mean, they would like to just be able to say that and they're like, oh, my dog's leash is made out of environmentally conscious class that we put in the ocean. I was actually a part of the expedition. I was there. That was a good idea. Yeah, I mean really just, I just think the sky's the limit in terms of just the attractiveness of that kind of plastic.

Speaker 2:          01:09:05       Yeah. And on one hand at the problem that everything is made out of plastic, but it does give a huge potential for alternative materials. Like there's ocean plus.

Speaker 1:          01:09:14       Yeah. What do you feel you're going to be doing when this is done? Like say if you get to this point where most of the stuff's pulled out of the ocean and what do you, what, what do you plan for the future? You're 23 years old. I mean, you can basically do anything you want.

Speaker 2:          01:09:27       Sure. Um, maybe go on a holiday for a month and. Yeah. And then I'll probably just be working on the next one. I think this is what I love doing and yeah, I hope I'll get the opportunity to work on many more problems like this in the future.

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       So you feel like you will be a problem solver, like that's your thing

Speaker 2:          01:09:50       that be. I should put that on my business card,

Speaker 1:          01:09:53       problem solver. Why not? Yeah, I mean that's essentially what you are, right?

Speaker 2:          01:09:58       I think there's just nothing more fun than sort of solving a problem as. And when you think about project like the ocean cleanup, you're sure you're solving the southern part of a massive problem, but just the whole road to it. It's just like one little problem after another little problem and yeah, I just think it's just very sort of intellectual intellectually satisfying to be sort of confronted with this new weird problem and then you can have to sort of think how to solve them. And as you know, as the CEO, you're sort of the accumulation zone, the garbage patches it were for problems within your own organization. So everything that other people cannot solve sort of end up with with you. Um, and yeah, kind of, I kinda like that. It's a, it's this fun thinking about things. So for example, just this week we had a, like a, I think it was last week, so on Monday that was, so we have this assembly yard and there was a fence that was seven meters.

Speaker 2:          01:11:04       I'm too far to the left and there was just this, uh, this email from the, from the government saying, well, if you don't move it within 10 days you have to stop your operation and I go, Shit. Um, but yeah, I mean, so this little problem and you just have to do a few calls and think about, well, how can we now arrange the assembly yards in a way that it's still big enough so we can assemble this 2000 feet thing. Um, and then the next day turned out there was sort of a slight misalignment of one of the connections strips on one of the flotation elements of the system. And you Kinda have to figure out how can we still attach it while I'm sort of working with this and you know, sort sort of just details, but there are details on a daily basis and yeah, that kind of what makes it fun for me, if it would all go fall asleep would be pretty boring.

Speaker 1:          01:11:52       Well that's what's fascinating about a guy like you, is that your personality perfectly aligns with this kind of problem. I mean, and that's a very unusual thing. Did you, were you a puzzle solver when you were a kid? Were you into like mysteries? Like what is.

Speaker 2:          01:12:08       I'm not really, they're just billing thing. So actually, so one of the things that I did it funny anecdote is when it was, think it was about 13 years old, I had this idea of doing, getting into the Guinness Book of Records with launching a model rocket. So it was already into those kind of things and build them myself and they shoot up like 300 feet in the sky. Um, and what that then do, I was sort of organized this whole thing with like there was media and we had sponsors and we at the university collaborating and we just had the sports field with 300 people who were all at the same time. They would all launch the rocket and actually I think we launched like 213 of them at the same time and actually got the Guinness Book of Records. So I always had my projects, let's put it that way.

Speaker 1:          01:12:57       Have you thought about potentially working with companies that produce environmental waste, like maybe a company brings you on as a problem solver for some sort of an issue that they have a residual issue of something that they produce?

Speaker 2:          01:13:15       Um, yeah, I mean I don't think it will be very interesting to be a consultant or anything, but um, yeah, I mean definitely sort of after this I want to do sort of solve more work on more bake challenges.

Speaker 1:          01:13:31       Yeah, like oil spills, things along those lines. Um, yeah. I mean you can keep guessing, but yeah, you'll see, you'll see. I'm sure. I'm sure we will see. Well listen man, I'm so happy that you exist. I'm so happy that there's someone out there that's actually doing something about this and uh, I've, I've seen, like I said, I've seen many of your talks. I think it's a comprehensive approach. I think it's amazing and I really hope that something comes out of this. It really works well. Thanks so much. Thank you. My pleasure. And thanks for doing this please and tell people one more time how they can get to your website.

Speaker 2:          01:14:06       Yeah. So it's the ocean cleanup.com are also social media, just at the cleanup to follow us as we launched the first system this summer. And your social media accounts are a boy and slept less lat. Yes. B O y a n s a t that's twitter, instagram, everything. All the above. Yes. Thank you. Boy, this was what, a lot of fun. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Alright, that was great man.
