Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Gosh. Dang. Is this working? Hi, this is Bill Gates and you're listening to the Joe Rogan podcast. We were just talking before you can hear and ladies and gentlemen about unsolicited testimonials or soliciting testimonials, right? Yeah, but it's not really a testimonial because you're just asking a celebrity to say, ah, you're the audience is listening to the Joe Rogan podcast. Like, you know, hi, this is calling for him. Is that your phone on my phone? I don't use that stupid ring.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       This is highly unprofessional. Okay, here we go. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe rogan.net, click on the link for the flashlight in her, in the code name, Rogan blahdy blahdy Blah. Save some money. You get a 15% off number one sex toy for men. Um, I actually used it the other day. Remember I've tip too from you. Yes. I attempt to, and I used one like maybe, uh, two weeks ago and I took two cause I knew I didn't want to wash it. So I used it and threw it away. It was cool. It was it. That's it. You just a one hit it and quit it. That's it. No need to save it. Well, you can always get a new one for me, buddy, anytime you want. Yeah, I did. That'd be cool. You know, whenever the missus is out with the fandoms or with the family and Bakersfield, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       It's perfect. Yeah. It's uh, it's a very underappreciated product. You know, women that women should, women that are afraid that their husbands are cheating and all that shit, they should be giving their husbands these fucking flashlights. Come on. You imagine the amount that the percentage of, of cheating that would, it would cut out instantly. Cut out a lot of it. But I think a lot of cheating is psychological too, but I think overall, generally if you got a wife that was, yeah, of course you're not gonna let you cheat, but she was giving you like every week she just, it was part of the groceries and shit. She brought him out in fighter tortillas. Fucking Cup of flashlights. You're like, I wanted six. You only got to show what are you going to be gone for two weeks, what am I going to do? What to do?

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       Like a half an hour. You're not down with cleaning them. You don't clean them. Yeah. That's the problem. They need to make them so cheap that you could buy them for it. You know what? For five bucks, Shit, I'll buy like six. Well, if you think about how much it costs for if a dude like essentially pays for sex, you know, if a dude takes a girl out and she fucks him because he took her out to dinner. Yeah. How much is that? That's gotta be like a couple hundred bucks, at least right flashlights pending. Take a girl to like swingers or something. You can get away with like 60 bucks. You don't want it to go to Katana. It's Katana is your fuck. It's like three 25 and Oh, you've got to Fogo de Chao. Damn. You better have just gotten paid.

Speaker 1:          00:03:05       Isn't it funny when you're dating people and you barely know him and you have to spend a lot of money on him to impress them and how cool is it when you get to that point where you could just, you know, what do you want to eat? And they're like, I don't care. And you're like, El Pollo Loco, you'll fuck out. I'm like, Damn. Like when you cross that threshold of going to El Pollo Loco on anything, like a big deal. Like you don't have to impress the bitch. It's nice. Wow. That's crazy. So is it like, do you, do you think, why? Why, I mean, why is, why is it so important for guys to impress girls where they take them? Well, the girls want to be impressed, man. No girl wants to get picked up and I had shit jalopy and taken her Donald's right. That's not going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:03:41       I know girl is going to be down with that unless she's like 16 and she's just happy that motherfucker has a car and you know what I mean? They'll go anywhere. Yeah. Girls are not really into dudes with fucked up cars. You really can't keep that going for too long. You gotta be a bad motherfucker. Of course, in a fucked up car. Yeah, it's a weird thing. And then you know, it's like no one wants to say, I mean, it's not entirely common. It's not every woman. It's on every woman in the world who only wants guys to do that, you know? And a fucked up house man. How long you've known me for a long Goddamn time. How fucking nasty my house, my house is nasty. Up until up until like 45 years ago, I was living in basically a doll house. It was a one bedroom house.

Speaker 1:          00:04:27       It was the smallest house ever was a war. It was a house, but it was a one bedroom house and had the living room, had a bedroom, tiny. And when I first moved to Hollywood, I moved with a buddy of mine, James. We split that motherfucker. My whole existence was the bedroom and there's a whole existence was the living room is Christ. Oh, let me get the commercials out of the way. We've got to keep going with that thought. This, I got to get a more effective way of delivering commercials. Oh, my tee shirt company. Hire primate.com hire-primary.com people keep asking me about it. I hardly ever talk about it, but yeah, I have a tee shirt company and it's all a psychedelic mushrooms and monkeys. It's all like monkeys playing chess monkeys and aliens playing chess monkey's in space. It's just weird. Psychedelic monkey imagery.

Speaker 1:          00:05:11       That's brilliant, man. That's all I've been fascinated. Even selling a lot. Yeah, they sell pretty well, but I don't tell people about them. I'm like the worst a advertiser ever when it comes to that. I just saw, I always feel weird, you know, talking about shit you're selling like so I don't do such a good job of selling shit. You do a great job at that. Mushroom had stuff that's mushroom Alpha brain. What is the mushroom that I'm thinking about? Shroom tech. Yes. Yes. You do a great job because every time I'm here and you'd give that commercial it. You're so passionate about it. You know what, you, you're not only you're passionate about it, but it's, it's a totally different commercial. Every time you're telling people to go make their own shit, they're not necessarily, you know, that's, that's, yeah. Well I eat the most important thing for me always with any of these things is to make sure that no one feels like they're getting ripped off.

Speaker 1:          00:06:03       I do not want a single person having a feeling like they're being ripped. Totally. That's the most important thing for me. Everything else is secondary. So there's that, you know, and then there's the way we have it set up where anything you buy from [inaudible] dot com like when you buy like the first order of 30 pills of anything, there's a hundred percent money back guarantee. You don't even have to bring it back. All you have to do is say this shroom Tech Shit didn't do enough for me or this Alpha brain did do nothing for me. These are the best nutrients and supplements available for this, for the, for these particular functions, for nootropics and for, for the, for sports athletics. When it comes to like a performance and endurance supplements. Shroom tech is like one of the best endurance supplements I've ever tried. One of the only ones that I've ever tried.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       It's super effective. It's got a lot of B 12 and eight in this quarter steps mushrooms and it's, it's fucking, it works great for me and I get a lot of reports from people that use it for working out and it's crazy and they love it when people say as I've always been. I've been at vitamin freak before we even started here. I've always been a massive vitamin freak still. You influenced me a lot, ma'am. I'm on, I'm on honest since serious diet vitamin plants since I was 22, 23. I was just obsessed with it and um, I just, I just wanted to, it was all about, uh, making sure any cancer, cancer phobia, making sure your body gets the building blocks it needs to stay young, looking as long as possible. I want her to look good as long as possible and drag it out.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       You know, I'm not ready to throw in the towel. So that was a lot of that going on on my right. And I would get into arguments with, with people and they wouldn't, they'd say, how do you know what works man? How do you know what works? And I'm like, well, um, you know, I'm doing all I can but if you want me to break it down for you, how does it work? Uh, is there a difference between chocolate cake and a chicken salad? Okay. Yes. Yes. What's the difference between chocolate cake and chicken salad? The nutrition. What's nutrition? It means what? What nutrients are in the chicken and in the south. Oh, so now what are nutrients? They've isolated these nutrients that you can take massive amounts of them. The only way it wouldn't work is if they weren't actually putting those vitamins and minerals in there.

Speaker 1:          00:08:24       If it was just some fake ass milk powder or whatever, then yeah, it's not doing shit. But I'm doing what I can to make sure, you know, cause there are nutrients and we have, science has known this is basic shit. Nutrients are needed and and all disease is caused by a deficiency of certain nutrients. It's really basic shit. If that vitamins I'm taking, if they really are what it says they are on the bottle for sure. It's good for you. Absolutely. Yeah. I've uh, I've always been into vitamins, but when I started hanging out with you, that's when I really kicked my vitamin game up a notch because I was like, this mother fucker, it's like super, you were real disciplined about it and I was like, you know what? I need to be as disciplined as he is. That's really a smart thing to do because I know, I feel I took two weeks off of vitamins recently just for whatever I just said, let me see what it feels like to take two weeks off of vitamins.

Speaker 1:          00:09:14       I took two whole weeks off of vitamins and dude, I felt lethargic. I just didn't, I didn't feel connected. Right. Be Like I was not getting enough from my food. And I'm a, I mean, pretty clean. I mean, I, I've fucked with some cheeseburgers every now and then, but I'm eating a lot of salads, a lot of Greens, a lot of Kale shakes and shit. Still do not feel as good as I do when I'm taking like basic multivitamins, multi minerals. I take a lot of fish oil, take like 10,000 milligrams official a day. And then I take these nootropics and of all the nootropics I've ever found, two of them have worked great for me. One of them was called neuro one and that's bill Romanowski stuff. I told you about this right? Any, there was a guy named no name, he's a Dj up in San Francisco and he became friends with Roman Nowatzski Roman house.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       Can, you know, he's taking like a bunch of head injuries from concussions. So he came out with some shit called neuro one. And it's like all the best nutrients for your mind. All the, you know, like it's very similar, very similar, but it's Kinda like a caffeine to it too. It's good. It's like a little bit, a little bit caffeinated, I believe. Here's, here's the little, uh, build knowledge. I'd like to share with all the Jujitsu players out there. Guys that train MMA, this is some serious knowledge. Believe me, trust me. You want to keep ringworm away. Take acid office every day. Thousand percent 1000% of you take an acid off lists every day or eat a big thing of yogurt everyday cause that's why yogurt is good for you because of the active cultures, the friendly bacteria, that's what you need. Acid office is bacteria that your body needs.

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       You actually need bacteria. Believe it or not. You know, I thought it was kind of weird. I don't know. There's good bacteria. The fuck does that mean, but yes, unless the signs, unless they're lying to me that we need friendly bacteria and acid. Doubtless that's what friendly bacteria is. We're actually taking pills that contain millions and millions of good bacteria. And what it does, this is, this is what I read. It eats the uh, ring ringworm attaches to your skin. It eats certain things on your skin. So ring that fungus will grow and it's eating something on your skin. Acidophilus eat, ring warm food first. So ringworm can attacked itself as itself too, and it has nothing to eat. So you never get ringworm and at it sounds crazy. There's guys how that, how do you know where's the proof? Trust me. Trust and have used to get really warm all the God damn time. I was always, I had Lamisil ready to go and if you get really warm, get Lamisil, don't get low. Trump man, don't get nothing else. But Lamisil cream, you're grinded

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       in with acute tip. That shit will kill it in five days. You want to have ringworm for three weeks or a month. Use Loma trend or that, uh, any other shit. The only thing that works is Lamisil. Trust me the cream. Oh my God. That stuff. I got Loma trend, go back to the store and get Lamisil. The cream. Trust me on that. And you know, I used to get ringworm all the God damn time God at Exxon jocks, man with the g, believe it or not rent. Lauren was just like once every three or four months, God damn it. And I'm out of training for like three weeks or whatever cause I wasn't using Lamisil, it wasn't out yet. And then I read somewhere that acid off lists, um, eats, uh, bring one food. I don't know where the hell I read it. I just read it and I, it made sense to me and we should probably Google this little yeah, look at you know, what? Look at it. Okay. Yeah. But you're right. Right. Once you start and you run it when anytime I get ringworm, it's when I run out of Acidophilus and I'm too God damn lazy to go to the store and I let it, I don't go to the store for like a week. Boom rain. Where am I? My arm somewhere. I know it works 1 million percent. Yeah. How does it look? A little advice for y'all? How do you spell acidophilus? A c. I. D. O. P. H. I. L.

Speaker 3:          00:13:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:12       You or some shit like that.

Speaker 4:          00:13:15       I got lost at the hand. Yeah, he did a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:13:23       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:13:27       Hmm. Yeah, this is a,

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:13:29       Well, I'm sure there's something that's going to explain it to us technically, but basically that's one of the home remedies to cure ringworm is that yogurt and it prevents it. If I'm on ringworm and or a an acid office for a year straight guarantee, I going to get ringworm. There's no way. Yeah, well I haven't had ringworm in years. It's, it's true. And one of the other things are taking another form of a live culture is Kombucha tea. That's an easy for me, I liked the way it tastes. You've had those, right? Those big synergies. I think I've had one in the Ed tech kind of an acquired taste, right. It's like you swallow it a little bit of loads in there. There's some like, I mean there's like some live organisms you're swallowing. Like I tried to get Anthony Giordano on, he was like, oh I can't get through that.

Speaker 4:          00:14:14       You'll read your swallowing the live thing. You are swallowing some like live loads. We're still in the middle of this commercial. Tactically, uh, go to Joe Rogan. Not Net. Click on the link for Alpha brain and a written the code name rug and save 10% we've, we've said enough about nootropics. You know what it is folks, and if you're interested in it, you should go read about it. Google it, and if you think that our stuff is too expensive, please just steal the ingredient. Let's go make your own. I don't care. Just, I don't want anybody feeling ripped off, but if you want to buy it and it, it is good and I use it. I use it on a regular basis. I use it before anything important for my show. When I film my show in Atlanta, it took four of those bitches. I'm like, let's, I want to be

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       fired. I want to be on all cylinders. I 100% believe in it and if you don't, you can always get your money back first 30 pills, he just send it back. You don't even have to send it back. Rather you just say it sucked and we send you money back. That's how I feel. Exactly. That's, I could easily charge 20 bucks, 25 bucks, 30 bucks a month for your membership on my website for all the techniques that I upload. I talked for 99 I could have went nine 99 or 1199 easily. You don't want anybody to feel ripped off. Not only that, I don't want to hear any complaints. Yes, me too. You know what I mean? Anytime someone complains about, cause they're basically buying episodes that are filled with technique and I put them out every two to three weeks. I just, you know, it's, it's a lot of work and every now and then, uh, it, the episodes come out late and the guy will come and go on the board.

Speaker 1:          00:15:42       What the fuck man? Like dude, you're paying for 99 for everything I teach at school. It's not separate techniques that I film specifically for the website. It's the techniques that I'm teaching to my students at headquarters that that gets filled in and every technique I teach goes up on the website. You have access to the whole system for four 99 shut the fuck up for 99 a month. There's really not that much money. When you consider how much Jujitsu cost, what is it, a cheap school, 100 bucks a month cheaper. The most inexpensive like a hundred right. And I tried to 130 a month. Yeah. There's a lot of schools that charge one 90 to 10 over 200 they make you sign a year contract or you don't even want to talk to you. You know, I, you know, 130th fair. I was charging 105 for a while, but you know what I, in almost 10 years, I went from 105 to 130 no big deal.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       The big deal and this new space is expensive and it's fucking big man. The legend legends is fucking huge as far as like gyms in la where you can get like everything done. Damn, that's a gym. We can get everything done. You know, that's a big wrestling class plus a roof. I really, I really like watching Chris Riley train goes to Matt and Chris Riley's. He's a bad motherfucker when it comes to [inaudible]. He's very tactical, very smart, very intelligent guy. And look at the guys who brought up, uh, uh, Chris Brady, one of the amateurs that uh, he bought his third pro fight Saturday. Man, his standup is so wicked and I just gave him his purple belt. He just submitted a guy with a good team, you know, so he's a good dude too. I love that kid. I got, got, got a lot of good guys at that. Jim Collins, who by how nice is that guy? The whole gym is just filled with cool guys. Chris, Chris, the MMA squad, they're all coming up strong, like a force. It's taken a while to build them. Then they got to get, most of the guys were strikers first like Alan Gabon, Eddie Jackson, Cubana and a lot of fights. Right. And how many, I don't know, but a whole bunch. And, and uh, thanked them with Chris Brady. They were just pure strikers for years.

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       We were both there that were in the same building. They just weren't taken. They really wanted me to just mostly time. And then this was like 2005 2006 and as MMA rose as the UFC rose, they started at the gym. I got maybe I should do in the, you know, Eddie's teaching Jujitsu, maybe I should just jump in. So they finally jumped in like four years ago. I've had first. So now I got these vicious strikers. They're, they're an Allen as well. I gave him his purple belt as well. They're really good at do Jetson now too. It's fun watching this and this is just the beginning, you know, it must be really satisfying and watching people like from the time they first came to you when they didn't know much, to watch them start to tap people and submit people watching the progress, it's amazing.

Speaker 2:          00:18:38       Must be incredible. You know what's weird about that is when a guide comes to me and joins my class and it's his first day Ma, my inside, my initial reaction when someone comes and I meet him for the first time, I want them to say they've been training a year or two. It just gonna make my job easier if they have some kind of base going on, some wrestling. Um, but uh, but the guys had come in with zero experience, 100% green. I'm like, Ooh, this is going to be a hard one. But the basically retarded on the ground I crippled. It's like you re going through rehab with them putting their legs are just like, they have no clue. But when those guys, when they, when those guys get good and they start tapping people out, it feels so much better. The, I know I took them from a cripple and other tap and dude's out mad.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       That happens a lot and that feels really, really awesome. And it's, I see it so much that when guys come up to me and they'd, they're all pumped up and I see how enthusiastic they are. And I know they got the fire. I know because some guys come in and they don't really want a roll or first couple of days they're taking easy. They're sitting on the side, they're kind of just, you know, you know, dipping their feet in the water a little bit and they'd taken their time. And then, you know what, let me, let me get fundamental fundamental three months, a fundamental classes out of the way. Then I might spar, I don't know. And then there's guys with no experience at all. They come in, they've had like three or four beginner's classes and I make them take 24 beginner's classes before they can take my classes.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       There's some guys that come to me, you know, three or four classes and they're just so down. Like I won't, I won't subject, uh, a veteran with one of them when they're exchanging techniques and we're drilling because it slows everyone down. The beginners classes. So you know, that the strategies, the terminology, all that shit. So you don't slow us down. In the advanced classes, we moved really fast. I'm 24 beginner classes is enough, you know. But there's some guy, I'll let you roll if you want a role after the technique and you want to hang out in role. When those guys come up to me and they asked me and you know I've only had five beginner classes, but can I roll? I'm like, dude, you're gonna have so much fun, man. You have the right attitude, right? Like what? What role

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       means for folks who don't know is alive spar, I means you try to choke each other. Do you pay real close attention to a guy's first role ever? Do you have like guys that you see in Jenny? No. This is going to be the first time he's ever rolled your watch them closer? No. Well I can't tell. I can't tell you that. I remember anybody's first role. It's almost like it's going to suck really bad for a while, for three months. It takes three months for a guy to come in and not know anything, never played a sport in his life. You come in, your first month is going to seem like it's going to be like trigonometry. You're going to go holy shit. But it's just as easy as learning. The abcs is just as easy as the first day I had learning the abcs, your grown adult, and somehow you didn't learn how to read.

Speaker 1:          00:21:34       It's going to be hard in the beginning. You've got to learn 26 letters and then you put them together and you form work and then a sentence that's way like it seems so complex, but after three months babies can do this. It's the same thing with Hugh Jitsu. It's just as easy. If you could learn the abcs, you can do the Jujitsu, so after three months, that's the point where I notice people start getting, they start getting the taps in because in the beginning it's like you just joined a league or you just joined a class and everyone's really good at quake and they've all been playing quake two, three years straight, five years and 10 years, and the [inaudible] has been teaching for or playing quake for 20 years. Motherfucker helped invent that shit. He's a programmer, shit back in the day and then you come in, you're going to get killed on quick, you're going to get Jack, you're not going to kill anybody for a while, but it hurts you just as much physical physically.

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       You're not going to get hurt in Jiu Jitsu. You tap. No one gets hurt. I mean, you get hurt just as much as you know, playing basketball or whatever we said that before. But um, especially if you're all smart. Yeah, I've got to learn how to not muscle things don't, don't go crazy. You got to learn how to go full clip, but use technique. Yes. Some people are tests still terrified. They look at Jujitsu and it's terrifying to them. It's incredible how terrifying it is. The people. And it shouldn't be. It's so that people need to understand that most of the guys are just sweethearts and nerves to train. They're just, well, I think people in general, um, have issues with human conflict. They're scared of conflict of care, scared of someone beating them up. We are, you know, and a lot of us who got into martial arts like me and I know like you, we, we really, you know, we got bullied a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       We were younger, we'd go, we got in positions where we didn't know if we could defend ourselves. You know, that's like, that's one of the reasons why guys get into martial arts in the first place. Yeah, man, my first day. It's important. It's an important thing for I think for a man to learn. It really is absolutely for, it should be standard. It's your big like in PE class standard, everybody has got to learn how to defend myself. I didn't teach taekwondo for that long. I taught like mostly uh, like full time from like 19 to like 22. And that's when I stopped. So I didn't have like a lot of students that got real good. But I did have one and it was a girl who was this really shy, awkward girl and she was really like, she was really intense. Like she, like she didn't wear any makeup and she was like, I don't really know what her deal was.

Speaker 1:          00:24:09       My whole interaction with her was just in, in teaching or in the class, but she was like so intense man. She wanted to learn so hard. Like she was like so focused on it. She was like really shy and kind of weird and kind of embarrassed and I worked with her a lot because she would like want to enter into tournament's and I took her from being a white belt to being, this girl won this tournament. She won a tournament. I think she won like as a blue belt, a green belt or a blue belt. But I had basically taught her the whole way. I had basically taught her the whole way and watching this, this kid, it's like real awkward kit, like learn how to get enough confidence to go out there and enter into a martial arts tournament and actually win and like kicked this other chick's ass and like go after like this did the whole thing to her was like, it was so crazy in an empowering to watch someone go from being a complete total novice and to watch just the stuff that I put in their head.

Speaker 1:          00:25:09       Just the training that she did with me. She went on to become like really good like in just a couple of years. It was wild. It was wild to watch. It was crazy satisfying with Chris Brady again, he's one of that. Chris Riley's Muy Thai prodigies. He's, you know, he, I just gave him his purple belt. We were working on like, I'm not very good at the RM and gear team, but we started three months ago. I really started adding it in and I'm not that good. I started adding it into a weekly workouts, just working on the squeeze. It's getting, putting people in the guard arm and Guillotine cinched in and the guy on top has to defend and the guy on the bottom is working on his sleeves, were just working. That working, the ending of that guillotine. I'm not that good at it, but I didn't want my guys to be stuck at it too and the and the arm and guillotine.

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       Any gay teens are so important, especially in Nma and the scrambles. You really don't, you really can't set up a good team. The gates and you just got to snatch it and it's gotta be under the Chin and then you got to know how to close it and twist it and tinny love. Nate Diaz is bad ass. Was that where he got it with one arm? He had one arm just since through and he knew he was not going to lose that arm. His squeezes tight and he tucked that one on through and then he adjusted his hands and for people to train to get to like if you've trained over 10 years, maybe even at five years, you can tell when a guy owns a move, like before he got the tap, the way he wrapped it up, the way he, cause it took, you know when he wrapped up the neck it probably took another 20 seconds to get the tap. Maybe something like that. There's a battle. Got Something

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       pretty quick. It wasn't right away. He was battling with it for awhile. Made me, I would say maybe 10 at the earliest, maybe 2015 but during that period when Jamillah was fighting the gear team, you can just tell the way. Nick was like, damn, I never do good things like that. It's a one arm good team. You know Einstein does one arm good is the one that Chris Brady got it. Just a basic and Ghia team and you see how long Nate's arms are too. That's one of the bad. How's things about, I was guilty and he, he put Marcus Davis Hall with a good team too. Yeah, he catches a lot of guys with that. That's his shit for sure. It's tight when he mounts you too. God dammit. That's what I, that's a thing of beauty. That's beautiful and people that don't train out there that try it.

Speaker 2:          00:27:28       You got to understand that. I'm just like a video game. My video game analogy, not everybody can, even though most people, most black belts can probably figure out that guillotine and teach it that. What Nick Diaz is doing that to have it down so good that you can put it on another black belt, a guy trained to defend all that shit all the time. Defense is way easier than off fence to pull it off. You have to put so much time into that, move into that transition into the, that movement in the squeeze and the bend. There's so much that needs to be polished. Not Very, there's not that. I mean, in the UFC I would say maybe there's at Max, uh, 10 guys that have a guillotine as good as Nate Diaz, like that one. I mean, you just don't see it. Even 10 shields, Jake shields, you know, Jake shields is got a nasty gear too.

Speaker 2:          00:28:25       Yeah. But the one, the one that Nate did the one down so good. You could do it with one arm. Well, Jake does the one arm. He, yeah, you're right. You're right. I remember he got Nick Thompson with a one arm. Yes, definitely. Definitely. I would say, or it wasn't a drug for Jake. Shields has one of the best squeezes in the game. Yeah, sure. Caught Robbie Lawler. And with the [inaudible], he gets a hold of next. It's, he's a dangerous motherfucker. The crazy thing about the guillotine is it's probably the easiest choke to learn yet. So few people have mastered it to the point where they're finishing, uh, people in big MMA fights, but people don't realize. Also there's a whole bunch of weird different grips that people use for these techniques to which greatly alter the way you apply pressure. It's all about what you're used to.

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       I mean, you could make really any grip work cause there's probably about, I'm going to say I'm just throwing this number out, five to eight different gay teens out there. Maybe there's four, maybe there's not five off the top of my head. Maybe there's more that I, I just lost track of. There's the Marcella teen, there's the regular Armand [inaudible], there's the arm and gates in the den. He lives with the inverted Pretzel Grip. Um, there's de Verdad Pretzel Grippers to Shit. Yeah. I just watched a video of Marcello explaining why he uses this grip for this team and it makes a lot of sense. I made a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       A lot of sense. When you go in, right? You're going into guys justice here, right? They're going to defend like this, right? So they're going to hook the outside that they're going to, they're going to be between you and your arm right here. See that? Right? So you make room and then you could stick this one on top. See if you were going to do, uh, like let's say this grip here, they're hands are right here. They're stopped. They're stopping for folks on Itunes, we're describing a bunch of different ways to squeeze someone's neck. Do you understand? I told him I need this space. If I go this way, I need this space. But that's where their hands are going to be, right? So Marcello's wise, he needs the space in between my hand and the body. I govern that. So even if you grab my hand here, I could still pass this.

Speaker 1:          00:30:28       For the folks who are listening at home, what he's doing is changing the way his, his hand is in relationship to his body where you squeeze a person's neck, it's all about squeezing their neck. It's, it's amazing how technical over this. So people really don't know how technical it is. I mean the, the actual technique that's involved in Jujitsu, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's really an amazing and fascinating sport cause it's like an expanded game of chess. It's more fascinating than chess because, and you said this, you were the first person to ever said that much. Someone was talking about Jujitsu be in chess and you said, yeah, but it's with chess pieces like this piece can only go like there, you know, or this piece can only though with Jujitsu it's bodies and strength and all this other stuff. It's like you like it's way crazier than chess.

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       And I was like, yeah, you know, you really stop and think about chess. Checkers, competitive. I mean you're, you're dealing with, I'm thinking you're dealing with technique, you're dealing with strategy and he's dealing with patients. You're dealing with Breanne, knowledge of positions, knowledge of the next step to the next step. Knowledge of if this guy does try to count and he's going to do this and then I'm going to do that. And then if he does that, the only thing left for him is to leave this. You know, when you have these little steps that you have in your head, if you're an intelligent person and you could think far ahead, and if you're going to go against the go, doesn't have that, you'll always be one step ahead. So your mind is an important factor in the whole equation. It's not just about brute strength, it's about knowledge and position and keeping your fucking head together while it's all going on.

Speaker 1:          00:31:59       For people who don't train, man, God, you're missing out on a really fun thing in life. It's a fun thing. It's so weird fucking fun way to exercise. I've said this before, you find your nearest Jujitsu school. It doesn't matter if it's 10th planet. Hey, if there's a 10 planets, schooling your city, join it. Y'All, you know, you're going to deal with a bunch of open minded, fun, loving, uh, computer nerds, man that liked to, to play games of death. You know what I mean? But fine. If there's no 10 plan in school, fine. Amy School, just any Jujitsu is better than no Jujitsu. It's so much fun. It's the ultimate video game. I always say that, but man, it's so damn true. And what ends up is you end

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       up the people that can hang with sparring without getting, uh, you know, and they get tapped and they don't get all crazy and all burnt. Most people take it personal when they get tapped it there, when they tap out, they feel like their weakness has been exposed and they run from the gym and they don't want to tap out in front of other people. It's so crazy, their egos out of control. But the people that do stay are the people that can handle getting tapped and they keep their ego under control and it's all, it's all a mental game. You, you end up with a great group of guys that, you know, you could trust generally, you know, douchebags do filter through, but generally they'll, they'll end up getting cut out. You're just left with a bunch of great guys, you know. And one thing, one thing that, um, uh, that, that, you know, Jujitsu becomes so much a part of your life that after five years all your friends train Jujitsu, you end up like cutting out the friends that really don't train that much and, and most of your friends end up coming from the Jujitsu circle cause there's like a such a giant pool of great dudes, you know, it's, it's amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:33:45       It is true. You know, and uh, it's a lot of dudes who, I have a lot of friends that don't do Jujitsu like Joey and Brian and Ari. Joey wants to though he's, he's been wanting to like Joey's a big fan of Jujitsu. If he was in shape, I bet he would be into. Joey loves Jujitsu. He's all about it. But you know, he's got a lot of shit going on, man. The guy's a busy dude. You know, he's busier than ever lately, but the cool Joey's headline and all over the country now he's, he's headed down to, uh, if you want to see Joe, he's in Scottsdale this weekend. Scottsdale, Arizona. I don't know the name of the club, but if you go to Joey's Twitter, I'm sure he puts it up on his Twitter call them. Is that what you're saying? You think your phone at work? Yeah. I got two bars. Give it a shot. We have the most [inaudible] one bar signals up your socket. But uh, but anyway, Joe, we got this gigantic fucking standing ovation when we were in New York this weekend. Man. People love that dude. It was, it was amazing. I got it. Here it was. It was incredible, man. He went on stage. They were right at the top. No, he didn't even go at the top when we had Dunkin go up for us this time and that Joey and then Joey went up. God Damn Dude, he fucking crushed it.

Speaker 5:          00:34:56       This is New York. Yeah. This is like for a minute. This is Joey standing on stage.

Speaker 3:          00:35:04       Dude,

Speaker 5:          00:35:05       that sounds like a Coldplay. Countless ones. This is just Joey standing on stage. That's all he's doing. He just walked out onto the stage. You hearing this? This goes on for a minute, dude. That's something like a phenomenon, right?

Speaker 4:          00:35:29       Yeah. And I go, wow, that's incredible. That's, that's some rock and roll comedy right there. That was crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       You've been saying it forever and you've known him longer

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       than I have and you've always said he was the funniest guy on the planet and I started to agree with you back in 2005 when I got to really get to know him and it makes me funnier. Joey Diaz brings the party. He makes me feel better. You know, it was really funny. I love my manager. He's the best of, have never had another event, one manager since the time I was an open miker. But when we were talking about the show, they were like, we think you'd be better if you got introduced off camera. You know, if you just, you, they just say your name and you come out clean because otherwise like this guy's introducing you and people like, who's this guy? And I'm like, oh no, fuck away. Joey's pregnant me up. Like Joey's bringing me up. The Joey always brings me up with Joe when I worked with Joey.

Speaker 1:          00:36:20       I have more fun when I work with Joey. It's more laughter. It's more hugs, it's more, everything's funner. And you know, you know when he says funniest is cause you know he's known for the Joey karate reviews and all that stuff and, and he says some funny ass shit. But just like us, like when we were talking about fighters, we can't, we don't really say the same shit we would if we weren't on air. Right. You know what I mean? Cause cause the things guys say to each other about a fight and about a fighter that crushed, we would never say like 70%. It's just like we're being real on the phone. When Joey calls me, he calls me Saturday, he called the Saturday after the UFC and he's fucking stoned to the gills. Barely awake. He's like, he's like, I can't even say it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       I can't even say it. But he just crushes people. Yeah. You can't say what he says but he's always saying it to be fun. Funny Shit. That shit was so funny. People will never get to, he never get to hear the best shit shit that he could never say only. And it's a fighter like from like Uganda and he, he's Joe is never going to run into him and he's on his way out. Like he just got cut. It was a fighter that just got cut and never had a chance. It will never come back. The enjoyment then it might be okay to give the green light dude. He could say shit onstage that no one else could ever say stage. Exactly. He could say crazier shit stays in it. Camp podcast on stage. You can get away with staging and get away with it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       But on a podcast you've got to represent you on stage. You could just be material cause the real funny shit, the Shit Talk Shit with your friends on the street in New York when you're getting deep and there's no fucking rules and there's no one's recording shit dude, one time of the Goddamn comedy store, Joey Diaz and this is in front of a mixed audience, not just, he's talking about some defensive line and some strategy and football. There was a night of a thousand nigger and he's saying this on stage in front of a, a mixed crowd. Joey Diaz crazy. He doesn't give a fuck. It was a long time. He probably doesn't even remember that there's so much of his best shit you'd have to like remind him of. He's like, he's so free flowing when you're so he can just go on and on about any subject and it becomes hilarious. I think Joey being, you know, a hundred percent Cuban, I think a super Latin guy with that New York. Oh yeah, you can say Nipd g h I think black people let him say, are you really spelling it out? Instead of saying it, dude, I don't want people coming after me. Dude.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       It's become the new Mohamad wouldn't even say that he met quite to have never said Nig ga. Wow. I won't go there. Wow. That's amazing. What a powerful word. Oh No, actually he did. I'm sorry you wrote a song about it. I was wrong. For people who don't know Eddie is, Eddie and I have been friends for a long time and one time before I knew Eddie, I would have advised him against doing this. He made a video and he made a video of him playing a wrapper that whereas actually, whereas black face, and it was, the concept's really fucking, it's, it was pretty funny mad it, but people got really mad at you. People got really miss playing the concept. The concept was that this guy was pretending that he had Videle Lygo and that he was just, he had a cover his whole body.

Speaker 1:          00:39:47       Yeah. Just like Michael Jackson. So he had, he was just, the makeup was just to balance out the real color of his skin because he's really black. It's like, it's crazy, but here's like total black there. Yet until he's wearing like black man, I mean, it's ridiculous. And he's getting, he had an Afro Wig on, right? An Afro Wig. Yeah. Yeah. Well, um, the characters, like he curled his hand. It wasn't a wig. He's just curled his hair and he's only wearing blue. You when you did it, did you curl your hair and you have like a separate like biography for the character? The character actually. Oh did I have is since I got a home movie of how he ended up, he ended up with the makeup. It's the whole store. I got dude, I got a story before he was even born. His mother and his father like how they got together and then had him.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       He goes dude, is that one of the reasons why you won't say the word don't just the word Nigga. You know what after I, I, I just came up with that. I got really stoned one night, this is in 2000 I was watching a Michael Jackson. I was watching Barbara Walters interview Michael Jackson, that famous interview and she, she asked the hard questions. She said, Michael, when you look, what do you see when you're looking at me here? My uncle, she asked him that and he goes, Barbara, I don't look in the mirror. And I was like Whoa. And then he started in this interview, you explained that the reason he has all the white makeup is cause he has a, a logo is a, he has it all over his face, which by the way, he very might well have and, or have had, you know, I in for people to not, I have it, he could see them in narcos.

Speaker 1:          00:41:21       Like I have my, my knuckles like really white. You just don't see it on much on me because, cause I'm a white guy and he was telling Barbara Walters did, it was all over his body. And so the brown spots that remained here, he decided to like bleach those out and then cover all this skin with you. That's true. We'll do that. That could all be true. But there's, but there's black people that have, but there's black people that have that a logo and they're all white and they choose the brown makeup. Can you chose the white makeup? He didn't have to choose why anyways. Right. You know, but if you look, if he did, I think in his case, if he's to be believed his, he would've had to have makeup all over his body. Apparently he believes his whole body or something. Yeah. Well, there's sprints.

Speaker 1:          00:42:01       There's some severe cases of it. There's a lot of, it's stress. It's nutrient, and that's one of the reasons, by the way, my Videle lag. Oh, completely stopped. And once I started taking vitamins, hardcore completely stopped. I believe it never spread. Who's more stressed out than Michael Jackson? Yeah. I almost went to jail from a lesson boys. But anyway, even if he does have a good excuse for his face being all white, you know what I mean? Then you add all the other stuff. The guy straightens his hair out. He got nine nose jobs, facial reconstruction to me, nobody wanted to be white more than Michael Jackson. He want her to be white more than anybody. And he got away with it in increments because everybody that is around them, no one's gonna. No one's going to say, Michael, what the fuck are you doing in your face?

Speaker 1:          00:42:44       They're out of the circle, they get cut out. So He's surrounded by a bunch of guys. Like every time he did something to his face or whatever, people didn't even notice it. It said, Ms Mr. Jackson, your three o'clock cause here Mr. Jackson, we've got some more boys in the backyard, Mr. Jackson. You know what I mean? They have a question him, they get cut out. No one's sat him down and said, dude look at the fucking mirror. You look like an alien. He kept just chopped. He just kept going, kept going, kept building fucking carnival rides and all that shit. So to me, the character back to the character, I was watching this Barbara Walters special and I thought, what if a guy did it in reverse? What if there was a white guy that wanted to be black so bad that he used the same excuse? Have you seen this video of the tanning lady from New Jersey?

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       I saw a picture of her dude, dude, you got to see the injury. You haven't seen the interview. Nah, you're not going to fucking believe this. There is a lady who tan so much. She's black, like Denzel Washington. Dude. Wow. She's a white chick and she's black as fuck. It looks like a Saturday night live parody. It totally does. So it doesn't even look real. Is there anywhere I could? Where did I say? I'm going to pull this up for you. Hold on. I have to stand down. I'll pull it up. I'll pull it up a youtube. I'll just think, let me see Tammy, if you go on youtube, Google or search for [inaudible] this is still up. It's still up there too. It's still up there. Quad tooth. Um, it's uh, please forgive me. I did that like 12 years ago. I didn't realize putting on black, like putting on black makeup was like considered like blackface.

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       Like I didn't know the whole history of blackface. I just created a character guy wanted to be black so bad that he lied to people until people he had video blog. But I didn't realize it was like taboo to put black makeup on. Um, I, I'm sorry to all my black brothers out there and people get manager. Yeah. There's some people that got mad at me, man, there's some people that got mad. They thought it was racist. A lot of people thought I was right. The guy who put it up on Youtube, he thought it was racist. He put it up to like ruin me. I mean that video was on one of my first DVDs or it's, yeah, it's on my first DVD or summer, my second one. But I actually didn't put it on Youtube. A guy who hates me, who thinks I'm racist.

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       A white guy who uh, who just took offense to it for some summary. This is real. She took her daughter tanning apparently this crazy bitch. But wait til they get to her. Look at her. Jesus Christ. Is that the scariest thing you've ever seen in your life? Does she think anything's wrong? I have no idea. She talking about slowing down? No. Look at her and for folks who can see, you don't want to hear this woman's voice or I would, I would plug in the audio, but shit, you don't want to hear this lady's voice. It will just depress the shit out of here. And this person has a kid. She took her kid into the fucking tanning booths. Apparently. That's why there they arrested her. The rest of their, for having her, her, her kid wants to get like mommy and become, she looks like an aborigine.

Speaker 1:          00:45:40       She looks like she's out in the middle of the woods, by the way. I think aborigines, you know, I'll say that. Or is it asking them? Well, one of those a new thing, you're not allowed to say. Someone said, you know, really, you can't ask him. I'll ask him. I was bad. It's uh, it's, uh, if they're working with, if there were more neighborhoods of Eskimos, you know what I mean? Then we'd have something to worry about. Are there, are you kidding me and Alaska Dude, not an ally. Incredibly poor in Alaska. There's Eskimo get ashore. Oh yeah, for sure man. There's some, the poorest people you would think there'd be a, they just like Igloos. How much does that come? I try to live life. That's probably racist. Yeah. You can't say that. Well, I do the jokes. I mean I make fun of Sarah Pailin and told her to get back in the Igloo.

Speaker 1:          00:46:20       I mean, I can't see how that would be. I lose or you know, for primitive people. That's why, you know, they're, they're modern Inuits they're living in 2012 they have the internet, they're out there trying to get jobs, you know, but a lot of them have the same problems that American Indians do. You know, new people came in and took over the land that their families had been used for generations and generations is more equipped for the fucking end then Eskimos that she wasn't ready for it. How bad I said then when you think about it, some people that survived in a place where it was cold as fuck and they're just walking around walking around or Negroes for real and they still make them. But they had to make now, I mean, I'm sure somebody would if there's bad ass pimp igloos right. Got that live in caves, man.

Speaker 1:          00:47:03       I was watching this one thing. It was a book that someone read about a man who, who got done with who he gave up on money. Have you heard of this dude? Apparently there's only intelligent guy. Let me, let me Google this real quick, but you know they showed this guy, he's living in a fucking cave. He gave up on money in like 2003 he just said, fuck this. I don't want to deal with money anymore. I'm just going to live off dumpster diving and eating fucking roadkill. I would rather live in a fucking one bedroom. Egl did a fucking cave. Dude. Are you kidding me? Completely retarded. But you stop and think about the snake for the, came from land of the lost. Remember? That's a good cave, right? What are those animals that were [inaudible]? It was all lit up in there. Yeah. What were those things called?

Speaker 1:          00:47:47       Clean stacks. Yeah. I would live in that cave. That's it. You would look, that's it. That's it. That's the only, that's the best cave I've ever seen. That show was so stupid. I believed that. Yeah. This dude on survivalists.com apparently he's an intelligent guy too. He just, whatever, for whatever fucking weird reason, he just decided to just give up or if that was a gimmick. You know how he's famous now? He's getting laid. It's a blogger. Just tell. Just tell people you live in case he blogs in the library, but he completely gave up on money. Yeah, he's a fucking idiot. Look, money gets you soap and it's a way that we exchange worth. Yeah, it's, it's not perfect. There's some socks. But what you told me you wouldn't want to watch game of Thrones. You don't want to watch that show you. You're an asshole.

Speaker 1:          00:48:35       What's wrong with you? It's fucking amazing. It's an incredible work of art and it's on, you know, HBO get a job so you could pay for Hbo. You dumb. Fuck you cave dwelling, asshole. You're missing out on so much. Cool Shit. Have you ever had beats by Dr Dre headphones on? Have you ever wore those? You'd dummy? No. Are those cool? They're fucking amazing and yeah, they're great too. And they'd noise cancel when you're on airplanes. Dude, they got that noise canceling feature. So all you hear is the sound you get taken away, especially if you eat a pot cookie before you get to the airport. And he timed it perfectly, you know, beats by Dr Dre and this asshole, no money asshole. He's never going to experience that. If you've never experienced being way too high in a plane listening to some Jimi Hendrix while you got your eyes closed, while you're really freaking out, you feel yourself kind of freaking out because you're way too high to just be hanging around a bunch of people you don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:49:25       Laying down side by side next to some total stranger, there's some total stranger I could reach over and touch them with my pinky, like I have to stay all cuddled up so that I don't roll over and touch this total stranger. Maybe we don't know the whole story. Maybe like his wife fucked his son or something and he's was like, fuck that. You know, something horrible. You know, maybe. Yeah, we, there's gotta be some more, more to it for you to give up everything going to cave. Your wife had her do some evil shit. Maybe not. Maybe it's just, it's a fucking dumb dude. You know? Maybe he's just crazy. Who knows? The world is filled with fucking crackpots man is the world is filled with people that think they got it nailed and they found some new righteous course, you know? Or the guy might genuinely like being alone outside.

Speaker 1:          00:50:12       Who knows? You know, maybe foraging for food is the only thing that keeps him from being depressed. I don't know, man. There's some people that feel like they don't get enough out of living everyday life the way everybody else lives it. Maybe this guy has some weird sense of danger because he's out there live in like with no roof over his head and Kate use maybe that actually does give a little spark inside of him. I'm just talking shit. Hey, what do you think? What do you think about what they're saying on the Internet? It could be totally bullshit, but it seems like it's real. It seems like all the presidents are all related. Oh, I've seen those. I mean it's not been proven to be a hoax. I think we should go to snopes.com right? Nope. If that's real. If because on, on uh, Obama on camera is talking about him being related to Dick Cheney or or yes.

Speaker 1:          00:51:07       Yes. On camera. In an interview they ask them about it. Could you imagine if like that David Eick dude was right and they're all really reptilians. Could you imagine if life really was like a, a comic book movie? You know, Obama said on camera, he's on camera, he's like on some show and he goes, yeah, that's more of like the Reptilian side of my brain that would react like that. He said some shit like that. Then I'm sure David Eick is fuck has heads explode them. When you hear shit like that, you know, it w it appears, it appears there's so much evidence in different TV shows and news reports on it. News reports that George Bush is related to fucking like kings. There, there is a blood line, there is a royal blood line, and that all these guys that are precedent, they're part of the, uh, the 13 royal bloodlines.

Speaker 1:          00:52:00       How crazy is that? It's pretty crazy. What if it's true? What if it's true that they're all related and it's all like a royal family and elections are just a big fucking act easier. It'd be amazing if they could pull it off like that. You know, it was funny how some people like Brian Cowen, I love him to death, but he never believed in conspiracies. Neb believes no conspiracies. But when we were talking about Osama bin Ladin one thing, uh, he, he believed that there was a conspiracy on the Pakistani side and that they had had Osama bin Ladin tucked away, like near this big military base. You know, for years they haven't talked to him. They knew about it, but they kept their mouth shut even though there was like a $30 million bounty on his head. I can't believe the Pakistanis that there was a conspiracy on their side, but that there was no conspiracy on the American side.

Speaker 1:          00:52:48       Hilarious. His, his, his, his vision of it has to always be Fox News. I love the Guy, don't get me wrong, but it's, it's a, it's a fascinating thing how he, uh, he has this sort of, I mean, it's great to have a guy like that on your side. I wonder, I wonder if he'd been tower. Do you know if he thinks tower seven fell because of fires? Oh yeah, he does. He thinks of her fires like that. He goes by the Popular Science reports, Hearst publications that uh, the debunked everything, all the nine 11 things. The real, the real thing about nine 11. The first two towers. Don't freak me out as far as like you, how, how did that possibly happen? We've never seen a full jet airliner slam into a giant building like that before. We've never seen it. We've never seen two of them happen side by side.

Speaker 1:          00:53:34       We'd never seen buildings that were that tall before. Not only now. We never seen buildings that were that tall and that were made in when, what were they made in the sixties or something? When the fuck did they make the world trade centers? I have so long fucking time ago. Right, so these gigantic hundred and 10 foot, 110 story when my Hubby, how big are those fucking things? I mean they were incredibly Beatty. Some stories or something. Just think about how a hundreds years, a hundred more than a hundred more than a hundred that just think about how many fucking stacks of metal, something like that is and what our content that is to clean up. Imagine if that's the big conspiracy that it was done because those fucking things were falling apart and the construction company is to what it did it they flew the planes in because they just didn't want to be responsible for what happened whenever they just fell out on that. Did the high wire from tower one tower two he did a high walked around the, I can't believe that. Is that what the flying we'll lenders? No, no. It's called the something.

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       Dude. I can't watch that shit. Dude did it illegally. Oh my. He set it all up. No one was going to let that shit happen. They secretly went on online. They measured all the shit. They fucking made it happen. How did they get the wire in between the two times? It was, it was a very complicated, there was like five people involved. Can you imagine that shit? How crazy that guy and that guy, tight rope across tower one to tower two. Then I got a hundred stores or something. Alan saying as that guy didn't did it and it worked. I'm pinching my Dick together as you say this, I'm like my legs. I'm like, now I'm asking. Okay, so you said basically we don't know. You know the, the planes could easily caused those skyscrapers, but the crazy thing is most people, most people don't know that there was three towers that went down.

Speaker 1:          00:55:20       Three tower seven was a 47 storey skyscraper. That five different angles on camera went down like a controlled demolition. I mean, what does that mean? What could that possibly mean? They control, it takes weeks to set up a control demo. 1500 engineers and architects are all banding together and they all say that there's, that was a controlled demo. How is that possible? Why would you demo a skyscraper the same day those towers went down? It doesn't make any sense. There's a lot of unanswered questions as some fishy ass shit going. Unfortunate that there is so much fish. Yeah, Shit. And it goes like when you look into the whole Pentagon missile thing, it's one of those things to me where someone starts talking to me about, there's a missile it depending on, it wasn't a plane, it was a missile at the Pentagon. Just my instincts, my automatic instincts are okay, this guy's kind of a crackpot. This guy's a little bit crazy with the conspiracies. I don't know what the fuck at the Pentagon, you don't either. Second was a muscle. They've never released any of the footage. I saw the footage they release. It was only like a couple of frames. I couldn't tell what the fuck it was. It could, I don't know. Maybe

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       it was a plane. I don't know what it looks like when you take a picture of a plane that's going 500 miles an hour, a foot off the ground. I don't know what the fuck that looks like. I don't know. But when you find out that they really did have the accounting offices right there and that they really were trying to cover up some incredible missing money. What was, how much money was it? Two point 3 trillion trillion. Two point 3 trillion. It was just announced by Donald Rumsfeld the day before that there was a problem and the two point $3 trillion is essentially been swindled and they were going to get to the bottom of it. Well, the office where they're going to get to the bottom of it gets hit by a fucking projectile that blows a hole through the side of the building and into the courtyard.

Speaker 4:          00:57:05       Kills all the accountants. That's incredible. Isn't that crazy? That is one of the greatest all time. Like if you wanted to have like a conspiracy where there's actual evidence that makes you go, what the fuck does, could it be? Could they be this crazy? Could it be this crazy? What happened to that two point 3 trillion? It was it ever addressed again? Yeah. And there's, you know, do you know, or is that what happened to that money and was it ever addressed them? That'll have to do who's going to address it? But immediately I want to be when you, when you, even if you, you know, have an event like nine 11 after the dust settles, you know, so to speak, no pun intended, you would think that after a while people would go, oh yeah, that two point 3 trillion. What's up with that? People know that some scary shit going on.

Speaker 4:          00:57:46       People know that, that whoever pulled that shit off, if you try to bust anybody out, you're gonna die. You're gonna die. So everyone just keeps the fucking mouth shut. They know is fishy, you know? And then that, the crazy thing is that you hear about this Breitbart thing. What is that? They're an Andrew Breitbart. The Guy who died really recently is a very controversial journalists character. He apparently had some video that he was going to release about Barack Obama, and it was Barack Obama. And there was some video that was released, a Barack Obama giving like some sort of a speech when he was younger, when he was in college, I think when he was at Harvard. And uh, just, you know, it wasn't really that radical at all. You know, it's like, and but the word was that he was going to release something that was going to be damaging.

Speaker 4:          00:58:28       Well, the fucking dude ones up dying, right? No big deal. He wasn't that healthy. You'll look at him, he's kind of big fat guy and he probably had some bad Karma and you know, there's a lot of wild shit going. A dude's life is his ticker might've been, who knows? Right. So the guy dies, rest in peace. Um, and then after he dies, his fucking corn or dies by poisoning. So after his corner says that it's natural causes, then the coroner dies by poisoning and then you go, okay, what? That's when he got to go. What is it? I mean, I don't want to believe that the government or who the fucking scene or the Moussad or anybody decided to kill this journalist and then they paid off his corner and then the coroner winds up getting poisoned and killed or they, they threatened him or they use their influence or whatever the fuck it was. But when you hear a story

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       like that, God damn, it makes me go, is anybody checking on this? Is it, Oh, who's looking into that? That seems, that's a little, I would like to sit down with everybody involved in that sort of a situation. If I was, if I was the mayor or the governor or whatever, whoever the fuck would be the one who would have jurisdiction over something like that, I'd like to be the guy who sits down. He goes, what the fuck is going on here? Yeah. And, and the Pentagon thing, they're like, if a plane of is like a seven 47, a commercial airline hit that, uh, there've been lots of planes that went down. And what you find is a big giant chunks of the Fuchsia Lodge and, and, and suitcases and seats and tennis shoes in legs and body parts. That's what happens when a plane crashes. There was none of that shit.

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       And the only pictures that they show, like the debunker side, they show pictures, but like real tight shots of like, uh, burned, uh, airplane tire and then they show next to it. This is what it really looks like. It's the same room. Yeah. Where is that? Where did you even take that picture? Give me a shot from, from way back and show me all. Show me that it's the Pentagon. Why you showing that? The evidence, our pictures up close. You don't know where that is. A dark room and you're seeing like, oh, here it says United and the only shot, by the way, it would be very easy if the government wanted to release Photoshop images or images of other pieces of wreckage and claiming how many people really had access to the Pentagon at that day. How many people were running around and taking pictures along and I played it.

Speaker 1:          01:00:49       That's incredibly restricted. So it's not like it was open season for journalists to come and check everything out with cameras. So whatever photos they have, who the fuck knows what really happened? And then there's another photo where it's like you see the lawn and there's a little strip of like American airlines like bitch, how eat, show me everything all in one big shot of everything. Don't show me up close pay Tony Metal of everything. Yeah, a piece of metal up close. You are you telling me that that's evidence? That's not evidence. They, they must have like had like really detailed images of every single app. If that was an attack, they would have detailed images of every single aspect of that thing that they can know. One of the main witnesses, the chick that was the black chick that was on Jesse Ventura show and they didn't that she said there was no plane.

Speaker 1:          01:01:33       She walked over, she goes, she thought it was the whole time. It was a bomb because I was no evidence of any wreckage or seats or luggage and binder. What kind of record you would get though. You know, they have shown, they've taken fighter jets and they've remote controlled flied them remote, flew them into a gigantic blocks of, of concrete. They're like built this huge wall of concrete and they flew jets into it and the jets just incinerate. It's really crazy. Like, but I think they're going like way faster and they're way smaller. Yeah. It's a different experience. If you look at nine one, one, like a detective with an open mind and, and you have to know what an open minded first look at it like a detective would like you're a c CSI. Look at all the facts. Don't just say, oh, those, those conspiracy kooks conspiracy nuts. That's

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       not what a detective, uh, you'd get fired

Speaker 4:          01:02:22       right away by the way. You, you've got to realize folks, and this is absolutely 100% positive. There are people that work for the government that are involved in what's called disinformation. And one of the things that they will do, and this is a very smart tactic and very clever, they will mix truth with ridiculous bullshit that automatically makes you look like a Kook. So if, if you're, uh, if you're reading something and it sounds really good and fascinating and then completely ridiculous all at the same time, like someone, they, then they throw something about alien bases on the moon and that they have, you know, the transcripts of these aliens communicating with people. Like then you go, okay, listen to this fucking crazy bitch. Like, oh man, they ain't no aliens on a fucking moon communicating with Ronald Reagan. You know, what do you, what do you, what are you talking about?

Speaker 4:          01:03:10       But they'll mix some real truth about the CIA. So real truth about the way things are run and that way it diffuses all those real truths in people's minds. You associate that shit with big foot and psychics and it's just a bunch of crazy silly thinking that is a, as a, as a a full grown man, I don't have time for, you know, becomes one of those things. It's a, it's a really clever thing. So when you hear a naughty story, we hear someone who's saying something completely ridiculous but also makes sense at the same time,

Speaker 2:          01:03:40       they're probably government agents. Who knows, right? If I've been accused of being a government agent. That's amazing. That's awesome.

Speaker 4:          01:03:48       That's how they would do it. They would train me up through the ranks of being a fucking comedian and then get me indicates fighting commentary and then recruit me to save America from the bad guys.

Speaker 2:          01:03:59       Can you imagine what kind of a government agent, what I be telling everybody, go smoke some weed. Relax, do Jujitsu. Don't be greedy. Don't be a [inaudible]. Back to the original question. Like there's a question. Yeah. Why do you remember? How do you fucking, how do you feel about every president being related and part of the bloodline? Um, if it is true, what doing good stuff research. If you go to my youtube page and go to my playlist, I got the Illuminati playlist. Go to the, like the last one I added in the last two. It's in deep shit, man. I mean there's the president's actually telling you he's related. Like George Bush is related to, uh, like a bunch of people in politics now and like high and the guys like John Kerry and, and he's related to John Kerry or the bullet cousins and shit. Really? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:51       Dude. I'm telling you. I'm telling you man, unless it's all bullshit. I mean it could be all bullshit. This could be a total huge hope. Well, I'm going to uh, behind the matrix.com so let's see what they have to say about it. You got to see Obama saying it himself. He's related to Dick Cheney. Dude. How crazy is that? They're talking about it on a show that's not like some CGI shit with a different Obama. Obama is saying he's related that Dick Cheney and then it goes deeper than that. George W. Bush is related to like old, like kings and czars and shit.

Speaker 3:          01:05:27       Hmm. Wow. Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:31       This is the, yeah, there were apparently 44 men who are president of the USA are related. How crazy is this really true? That's what I'm, that's what I want to know is this, is this Bob bullshit yards of all 43 presidents being related and this is just randomly happen or billions to me.

Speaker 3:          01:05:48       Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:05:50       A billion to one is that, is that the number? Didn't know. The guy's saying billions. It's just someone's editorial, I believe.

Speaker 2:          01:05:57       I don't know if he's right. Oh, sources. Look Kaye, cnn.com Google Illuminati bloodline or youtube Illuminati bloodlines, dude. And just like Herman Cain related to people too, they're all related according to the shit. Most of the presidents are all related. They're all part of the same blood line. How fucking nutty is. That's ridiculous. Ridiculous. Riley be true. If it's true, do we really are the matrix dude, really? Our Vanilla, Rowdy Roddy Piper will be totally right. That movie them or day or whatever day it was at. It was a fun movie, man. I haven't seen it, but one of my students, Dave Callahan was telling me about it. He said, I need to watch it. Wow, this is so ridiculous. Are you finding out more information? It's just, it's ridiculous. It's just hard to believe. Exactly. But when you see Obama Search Obama, Dick Cheney,

Speaker 3:          01:06:52       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       Video, uh, blood, uh, cousins, Obama, cousin Dick Cheney. And then you'll see them talking about it. This is what their dos, this is really weird, man.

Speaker 3:          01:07:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:09       The uh, yeah. Uh, what's all right, I just, and he's coming over to take a look. It's just the different websites or point to that. I still honestly can't say that. I don't, I, I don't really know. It's true. I don't think you should be, uh, just reading something online and spouting off. That's true of doing that too many times in the past and been completely wrong. No, no, no. I know. I know. That's why I'm going to, I'm going to say, I'm going to send you a link Rabia theory. Why don't you ask Siri? Siri says, Siri. Yeah. That's, you don't want to share. See if it, we'll see what that bitch knows. Put her, put her at ease. Right now. I'm going to find the video. I'm going to call Siri. Okay, here it is. Um, uh, I'm going to send you the link.

Speaker 2:          01:07:45       I could send it to you and you'll be able to play it. Yeah. Okay. What is it? Wait a minute. You'll send it to me. How a t email. No, no, I don't have that set up like that. What do you want me to play? Just the beginning of, I want you to hear Obama talking about how he's cousins with Dick Cheney. Oh, I don't even want to hear that little. Now he's sick. He says it. I believe it. He's so, he's some somehow or another, some distant cousin with Dick Cheney. Yeah. But then it gets deeper. It's almost like someone, uh, someone dug that out and he asked to talk about, and he has to admit it, but it goes deeper than all. Relate it up. That's what

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       it's saying, dude. Everybody's related. Like George Bush is related to Obama. They're all part of the royal blood line that goes back to ancient Sumeria. Wow. Yes. Yes. This is a word doc. Elliptic shaped the rulers. It's just like a Hollywood club, right? The promoters, when they're, when they're new club dies, just like the ancient scenario died. When they're new. They're eighth cousins. Obama and Dick Cheney or eighth cousins. Yeah, and look at type in George W. Bush cousins press. Did you hear what Obama said when they will, they gave them the revelation. He goes, every family has a black sheep. Boom son, suck it. He's fun. He's for sure the most gangster president of all time. He said some gangster shit like Matt Damon said that he was disappointed in him and then you know, he does those uh, president's a press speeches where he does essentially does stand up and he goes, hey man, I saw you last movie right back at Ya.

Speaker 1:          01:09:13       Like the president said, your last movie sucked dude. And you know, it's even crazy crazy is that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are all in the mix too. They're all related to the presidents. What did you see Jimmy Kimmel doing? A White House speech or doing standup at the White House and or wherever the fuck it was. Some mean nuking which is in the audience. Obama was in the audience, whatever the fuck official name of the gathering was. He started talking about marijuana legalization. And then it's real. People care about weed laws. It's true. And that's who said that Jimmy Kimmel. Oh yeah, I heard about that. Yeah. Jimmy Kimmel is, it was, you know, it was a really fascinating moment, man. He's a brave motherfucker for doing that. It would end any was, and he's got damn right. You know, and he, he did what you're supposed to do if you get an opportunity to do something like that where it's going to be on television.

Speaker 1:          01:10:00       He was respectful, you know, but he was still funny, you know, when he was doing a standup and then when he had a point about marijuana, he just, he sits, made the point man that real people care about these laws. And he didn't go crazy with it and didn't go too far with it, but he was, he was, you know, it's fucking true. It took roast crazies that, that marijuana was a conspiracy. It's still is. It's still fucking is the most amazing thing in the 2012 there's people out there that will list all sorts of negative effects that can have. Listen, folks, fucking everything you do can have a negative effect. If you get crazy with it. We're drinking coffee here. Coffee can fucking kill you if you're crazy. And you one of those dudes who just wants to drink coffee all day and just get gacked out of your mind on Venti Starbucks, you could have a fucking heart attack.

Speaker 1:          01:10:43       You could like, you could stimulate yourself to death. People die from caffeine overdose. That's a, that's an actual, you know, fairly regular occurrence. I think there's something like 10,000 people die every year from aspirin and caffeine together combined. Something along those lines. Either way. Point is it's, it's the best site ever of a corrupt government that this magical plants, you know, and people's own full can pull it. Heard you fucking queer. We're all your magic. What do you want your weed, you fork can baby kids vibe without weed. Those people need weed. First of all. I'm more than anybody, right? Yeah, definitely. And, and second of all, it's, he don't understand what this really is. This is a potential life enhancing substance that is just naturally growing around people. And it's been with us for thousands of years and we have some sort of a physical symbionic relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       We actually have cannabinoid receptors in our brain that receive cannabinoids both from cannabis and from exercise. Your experience could have annoyance. That's a confusing. People don't believe that humans, and not by the way, by the way, there's the benefits aren't even psychoactive. One of the best ways to use marijuana is to actually eat it, to eat the fresh leaves, the eat, the leaves and the plants. It's incredibly healthy for you. It has zero psychoactive effect cause it's not the only one. You have to smoke it or your staff to cook it into an edible form and then eat it. But to just eat marijuana. It doesn't give you the psychedelic effects. But what it does do, it's a really incredibly healthy plant. It has a fuck load of amino acids, it contains a lot of protein. Hemp seeds are really good for it and they fucking tastes good.

Speaker 1:          01:12:28       Like I like eat hemp seeds all the time, like I'll eat them as snacks. I'll be sitting there watching TV and I'll have like hemp seed and it's, it's incredible amounts of protein. It's really healthy and clean and it's illegal. It makes the best paper, makes the best clothes you could make fucking plywood out of it. It's virtually indestructible. It's amazing. It's lighter than wood. It's, it grows quicker than would, it's stronger than wood. It's, it's an amazing, almost an alien being. It's almost like something there's, it's not like it's one of the most useful plants on earth of aside from the psychoactive effects of it, when you add the psychoactive effects, it's the number one use multiuse full plant on earth most for sure, because it actually can change people's lives and make people feel better. It actually gives you a good feeling like the everybody needs that.

Speaker 1:          01:13:17       That's like one of the most important things we could ever have. Something in our life that gives us a good feeling something or alive that makes us a little more humble. Something in our life that makes us a little more aware, something in your life that makes you a little more appreciative, you know, these poor fucks. Horrified. Did she feel bad for people that don't want people to smoke weed? Um, I understand. You know, I was, I wasn't into it until I was 28, so I totally understand where they're coming from. I just, you know, I don't want to push anybody into it or anything, but if, uh, I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing and, and let people know that, you know, most of the important stuff that I do, almost all of it, the important stuff I do, I'm medicated with, uh, the sacred plant.

Speaker 1:          01:13:59       I feel if I taught a class and I wasn't medicated, that I would be cheating out my students. I'm way more passionate. I'm way more passionate when I teach, when I'm still in way like doing comedy and you don't have a little weed in you. You feel like you're, you're, you're not giving, you feel like you're at 85 almost sometimes. No. I like doing sober shows too, but I smoked so much weed and my Mri ever really sober, you know, because it's adjusted the way I act. Even when I'm sober like playing music, not stoned. I couldn't even imagine that. And it's when I get in my car and I got like uh, uh, um, when I'm, when I'm getting, when I get in my car I just freshly baked on my way to Jujitsu. Man. That's when I'm on fire. That's when like all my important decisions and ideas come together on my way to Jujitsu cause I'm so happy that I'm going to show up to a place with a bunch of my boys there and we're going to practice strangling each other and whatever music I got to hear music loud is how on the way that you to loud man, you know, like a latest, like something I'm just working on or like a new album I just bought.

Speaker 1:          01:15:08       Um, like you know lately man cause Bassnectar up my ass man. That motherfucker is on fire. Holy Shit. Yeah, we're supposed to do a podcast with him. Yeah. End of May. Like a memorial day weekend. He either said Monday, he's free or that Friday. And so it's up to you Friday or Monday. So he's down. He loves you, he loves you. He just wants to hang out and talk. I want to hang out and talk to him. He said, let's just have a conversation. We don't have to record this. I'm like, oh man. So don't deprive people of this cool conversation that's going to be fun. He's a fascinating guy. So looking forward to it. It's, I am too, man. Incredible. That's why I keep emailing you and going, dude. He's like asking like, dude, is this going to happen? Is this going to happen to, I can't tell you how weird that is for me.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       You know, it's, it's weird, you know, that, uh, when I kinda got celebrities want to come on the podcast, I mean it's, it's, it's a weird thing that people are trying to do it, but it's amazing though. I couldn't be happier, man. This is the most like fulfilled, like as far as like, uh, like what I'm putting out. Yeah. Like the most fulfilled I've ever felt. Yeah. People. I mean, like he, he just wants, he doesn't want to talk about music. He's like, dude, I just want to get on that. Just talking about the unit might want to talk about music too, you know, whatever. You know, I, I love when people say that like, you know, um, I'm going to get a Mac dancing on the podcast. I really like Mac. Dan's like, I've been meaning to contact him so he'll hear about this or reach out to him.

Speaker 1:          01:16:34       He's a fascinating dude to me. Really interesting guy. He's a Vegan and he's a, and he does it for, for, because of the animal rights, like the way he feels about pets and animals and factory farming and, but, um, what's interesting is he's going to talk about anything, but I'm amazed was like, oh dude, can you imagine how these UFC fighters, they must be so sick and tired of talking about fucking fights and especially after training twice a fucking day, six days a week. Yeah. And I just want to say this to all my 10 planet heads. Uh, I, for every

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       interview I do where I'm just repeating myself, I know like my hardcore fans are like, oh, he's going to use that analogy again. Oh, that fucking story again. You know what I mean? Uh, I just answered the questions they give to me. I know I could be repetitive, I apologize. But you got to understand there's always new guys just getting into it, getting into 10 plan and I got to go back and give the history again. I'd, I'd that'll talk about the music. You know, that, you know, there's a lot of people out there. I'll, here he goes with the music again. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna talk about the music. No, it's just, I just want to let people know that because the, if I overheard someone saying, dude, that guy fucking just says the same shit over and over, that wouldn't make me feel good.

Speaker 2:          01:17:55       You know what I mean? But it's, it's, it's part of the whole thing. If you're going to, you've got to realize that every time you talk it's probably going to be the first time a fuck load of people hear you. And if there's an important thing that you have to get out, an important part of your philosophy and important part of how you got to where you have to say it. Yeah, unfortunately. Yeah. Until you become like Marilyn Manson to become like super dope. Yeah, totally. Totally. But I'm always gonna. I'm always gonna pump the music man. Always. I got to smoke shop and shirt on a smoke Sherpa servants plan this Saturday for my birthday. I'm like, yeah, where is that? It moved, right? Yeah. Move to dim mak studios, man. It's a way better place is way better place. It's in Hollywood. I'm on 1643 cosmo.

Speaker 2:          01:18:36       It's a half a block south of Hollywood boulevard. It's an awesome place. Dj Aoki, that's his place. It's called Denmark's name is Dj. Okay. Yeah, like Shinya. Yup. She's huge. Really famous Dj. Huge. I mean a million followers, that kind of shirts. They become famous without me even knowing they exist. And then I find them when they have like a 400 million youtube views, like I'll go and look and look at one of their videos on youtube, but I'm like, what this get this has 100 million views. What the fuck? How did I miss this? Whizzed right behind me. Yeah. He's huge man. He owns that place. Um, uh, it's, it's going to be my birthday celebration. My birthday is actually May 15th, but that's on a Tuesday. Can't have a party on a Tuesday. So it, me and my girlfriend actually have our birthdays two days apart. We're going to celebrate it.

Speaker 2:          01:19:25       Dual thing Saturday night. Everybody's welcome. No, cover it up right there. Everyone's welcome. No cover. You said the two craziest things you could ever say on the end. Everything's, everybody's welcome and we'll cover. No, I want it to be packed. It's just, it's going to be packed. I want it to be packed. We go on at 10 o'clock. So get the early. Um, a three is, you're going to get a crazy crowd, dude. I hope so. And if you don't know what my band sounds like, you can go on iTunes and just iTunes smoke serpent. I got two songs up on iTunes. A Jujitsu is one song and dropped as another song. Judo, there's a video for a Jujitsu as well. You could find that on youtube. Uh, smoke serpent this Saturday. My birthday, everyone's well, we could add that Bj, Jay, Jay Expo is this Saturday a day. That's when Nick Diaz and Braulio steamer go at it. Um, they, you could go watch that and just remember the after party is at Dimock studios on Saturday. The show. It's going to be crazy. You're going to have a bunch of people with cats on their tee shirts.

Speaker 2:          01:20:27       Catt squad cat. Beautiful. Beautiful. Um, also my wrapper, well one of my rappers is, his name is Capella. His name is Eric Cruz. He, uh, he's uh, he's one of my brown belt. He's awesome and he's an amazing rapper and he's really good at Jujitsu too, cause he's, he's one of my best friends. I love them to death, man. He actually fights MMA too. He's fighting May 20th. It's on a Sunday. May 20th at the Nokia Center is a third, uh, amateur fight. He's undefeated as an amateur. Um, there's a show called University of Nma. It's just a bad ass amateur card, like three or four 10th planet fighters are fighting and he's one of them. His name was Eric Eric Cruz. He wraps or smoke serpent, May 20th Nokia Center. Um, it's on a Sunday so you don't have to worry about missing Strikeforce like Strikeforce as the day before. And it's the debut also on that amateur show.

Speaker 2:          01:21:21       The first three fights are going to be combat Jujitsu. It's a sport that I started with Turi Alta via, he runs university of MMA combat Jujitsu. It's a brand new sport. It's going to take people really kind of scared to do it there that really don't know what to think of it. But really combat Jujitsu is, it's right in the middle. It's in between MMA and, and just straight grappling. It's in between. That was a big hole. It's Jujitsu with punches on the ground. When you're standing it's just wrestling. But as soon as one person is on the ground, you can start punching. So it's, you can either look at it as, you know, if you're looking at it from the MMA world, it's pussy MMA. Like, well I can, they're, they're too scared to strike standing. You could look at it as Super Tane MMA, but if you're coming from the, the Jujitsu side, it's extreme Jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          01:22:06       Imagine watching Abu Dhabi and they allowed punches on the ground. How brutal and exciting that would be. You know, it's, it's all your perspective and, um, it's gonna, you know, since we're piggy backing on the University of MMA show, you know, it's the first three fights. We're opening up the show. We're just getting into it. Just, we just got it sanctioned. We're just starting it. We're just testing it out. Ultimately, combat Jujitsu doesn't look good in a cage. It doesn't, it actually, it looks better like professional submission league, Rico chip rallies, old Dutch show. Then that Hixon Gracie tournament. We're just, it's like blood sport. Just a flat mat. Just like Abu Dhabi, a big flat matte. That's where combat Jujitsu is going to shine. It's going to take a while to become available. The elbow each other. No elbows or the body. There's basically amateur MMA rules on the ground. You could punch to the face, no elbows to the face. Wish they would find a way to pad elbows. You know the real problem with elbows and my opinion is not them as a blow. I like elbows there, bad ass, but then you know, tell that to Paul Horace. Then you'd have to like, but

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       you'd have to pad shins too. It's really kind of, then it becomes silly, but what I keep thinking is that elbows are so pointy. They're so good at cutting people open. How about fucking Alan Belcher's wicked elbows. Now Boucher is if you didn't see that fight. Sorry, spoiler alert. Shut this off real quick. If you DVR this and you haven't seen it yet, you got three seconds to one's Monday. Fuck them. Fuck them dude. It's on Fox. Watch that Shit did Alan Belcher. He went, he played footsies with Paul Harris. I couldn't even believe I did a little. Maybe you were what? You had a bad angle cause you weren't in the beginning. You look to you from where you were, where you were watching it. If you watch it again, watch a commentary. It looked like you thought they were going for lead glocks, but right away, right from the get go he pulled in right into the truck.

Speaker 4:          01:23:55       It was like a profession. What I meant by, he's on the ground by Paul Harris is attempting leg locks. That's playing footsies in my opinion. When you're caught in the truck, that dude, it doesn't have any leg locks on you. Well, he did try a few now there's no, he didn't even roll a couple times for the only when he started attacking his legs, that's when he spun out of the truck and started. When he got away, that's when he went after the leg locks. But while in the truck he was lost. He didn't know what he was doing. He was just defending. That was no leg locks. You look so confident. It was almost weird. It was almost like he couldn't believe that. I mean, I mean Paul Horez like when he got taken down, like what does this guy going to do to get on the ground?

Speaker 4:          01:24:31       He didn't get, he didn't take him down. Paul Horace took our shot, took Alan Belcher down. Yes, he took her Bahara shot, took Allen Belts Belcher down and then Alan Belcher laced in and rolled and got the, because he got the single winter, his head on the outside, which is, he couldn't, Alan Belcher could have took us back at that point, but he decided to go to the truck and it was so crazy to watch. And for people who don't know, it's just an unbelievably rare position in MMA, super common around a 10th planet and Jujitsu, but really rare, in fact, so rare that only one guy was ever submitted with a twister in the UFC. And that is, um, uh, the Korean Zombie chance on Junge submitted Leonard Garcia with it. But that was no battle from the truck with Koreans, Koreans, Abi and went from being on Leonard's back right directly into the twists are, there was no battle from the truck that again, like by the way, the truck for folks who don't know what the fuck we're talking about, it's a position where you have one leg tied up of your opponent with both of your legs, his back.

Speaker 4:          01:25:27       But you're at a, at a perpendicular angle and you're, you have like what's essentially a lockdown from underneath of this guy's leg. So you got his leg completely stiffened out and you're sort of controlling him with it. It's a, it's a, it's a great position that a lot of people don't sort of capitalize on. And it was a rare moment on CBS or excuse me, on Fox and I say CBS, Oh shit. Fox going to be mad. So rare moment is cause I was trying to correct my earlier mistake about Jake shields submitting Nick Thompson because it was on elite Xc, not Strikeforce. I kept that shit in the back of my head all this time. Fox. So he's on Fox. So when when he did it, when

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       he went into that position, man, I was like, I can't even believe, first of all, couldn't believe he is. Someone described it best on the underground. They said it was like a dude wrestling with an alligator and kicking his ass like, yeah, what the fuck he's going to rip your arm off to get to repeal. It really was like that. But then all of sudden he was like kicking the alligators ass craze and then he escaped the truck after like a minute he escaped and he, then he started attacking Alan Belcher's legs and your, those, his leg locks are so scary. You're a commentary or have you heard it yet? Have you went back? No, no, no. Dude, you gotta listen to your commentary. You're, you're like Alan Belcher's mother. You're so worried about how that, but I shouldn't tell people. I've had three knee operations, so in any ever a guy like Paul Harris is going for, he'll look, I fucking panic.

Speaker 2:          01:26:51       I feel it. I feel that shit go spit out. You can make it. It was, he can Rhea steered. It was hilarious. He was so passionate about it. You were so worried about, cause Alan Belcher, a friend of ours, he's been dimensions a couple of times. And by the way, you know Eddie and I actually had a conversation about this fight before and we were like, you know, what do you think's going to happen in that fight? And like look, I love watching Paul Horas crushed boots but I love Alan Belcher too. I'm just hoping to see a good experience. I'm so, I'm hoping to see a good fight. I never would have predicted that it would have went like that where Alan Belcher was so comfortable on the ground with him. Man. He brought it up. 10 Dean lister and Daniel Marae high level Jujitsu players and especially dean lister, cause he's always been known on the west coast is a leg lock mass.

Speaker 2:          01:27:37       You submitted Cocker Reco, he won the absolute knob Udag straight leg locks go man. Dean was tough to beat. Super Tech top five talking about world, super, super technical. So Alan Belcher being the smart guy that he is, he brings, you know, he's fighting Paul hard shit. You better bring in someone like that. You better bring in fucking Josh Barnett. You better bring in Dude's that that a rip legs off on the daily. Oh Alan Belcher has a very high degree of don't give a fuck to Belcher. Could fight man. You have to have so much confidence to just throw yourself at that guy like in a, in a ground war and and come out of it all time him and stay in his garden. Beat the fuck out of him from his world. That's the first time I ever had a conversation with Alan Belcher. He beat the shit out of somebody and I'd never talked to him before and I'm pretty sure you know all those.

Speaker 2:          01:28:29       UFC is eight straight years of UFC is, I get them all mixed up but I'm pretty sure it was in London or something like that. It was at an after party at the bar. He passed by me and he, we kind of like caught eyes and we never talked to each other. The four and then I, then we, then our eyes locked and I say decent liquor, romance like the notebook. It was like, it was a good, like an awkward thing in the beginning. It was because he really didn't say much. I did all the talking. I just said, dude, I mean I, I'd watch fucking fights like a motherfucker. I work for the show. I never seen anybody with fire. He has this fire inside of them is theory.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       And that's what I noticed from Alan like way back that he's so fearless. He doesn't give a fuck, you know? And at that point, you know, he wasn't known as the greatest striker in the world and he, and he definitely wasn't known as the ultimate submission guy. He was a well rounded guy who, uh, was probably best at striking and man without fearlessness for me, I just thought, man, if he just got really good at Hugh Jitsu, fuck, and then you add that fearlessness on top of it. Dude, he fucked up that guy on the ground and it's so crazy. It was so crazy to watch. And His standup is nasty and Duke Roufus is such a good trainer, man. Duke, Duke Roufus is so fucking technical. I've worked out with him a few times now. And when you work out with a guy and he sort of explains his philosophy for teaching this, why you're doing that, there's very few guys who could do it as good as Duke does and he just, he's just a really good guy too.

Speaker 1:          01:29:56       And all of his guys like, well, they'll like Alan, don't like, they're cool guys. You know, it trickles down from the top fearless. You know what? I broke down, I don't know if you've seen this. I released it early this morning. I did a, a video breakdowns, technical breakdown of what exactly what Alan Belcher went through in the truck. I really didn't get into the leg locks much or anything, but you can go on youtube and just punch in Eddie Bravo breaks down Alan Belcher's twist her attempts or whatever. Um, if you're interested in knowing exactly how it went down, I broke it, Dan on man. So it's out there on youtube. I just released it today. So anyways, what about Pat Barry and Lavar Johnson whole holy Geez, that was scary, man. That was, that was scary. That guy hits fucking hard. First of all, I couldn't believe that Pat Mary not only got him down, but mountain em and then hopped over to sign control.

Speaker 1:          01:30:48       I was like, Whoa, what's going on here man? I was like, what if we see Pat Berry fucking spin on a Samurai or some shit? What did we see? Pat Barry do the Ninja take us back. Can you imagine if Pat Barry just got like wicked good at submitting guys and the ground? He's a strong mother fucker, dude. Pat Barry is strong as shit. When Christian more craft had him down in his last fight, he that is, that's a big dude, that more craft. He's a big motherfucker and he had buried down Barry escape, got back up to his feet, did got away from a submission escaping up, back up to his feet. He never used to be able to do that before, but he got fucking caught against that cage with that big Lavar Johnson man, that guy, it's so hard. He, you know Joe Joe or Dan said it best. He said, he was like, oh no. It wasn't. Show deals with Tony Jr. Tommy Jr said it best. He's like, he's like old school Earnie shavers. Like the way he's throwing these bombs. I mean he's just a power puncher man. Yeah, that was, that was ugly to watch, man. Pat Barry such a nice guy. You know, it's like I don't he, it was like a Tommy Morrison beating. Yeah. Yeah. You want to Google an awesome boxing match. Tommy Tommy Morrison versus a ray Mercer. That's one of the most brutal beatings ever

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       to it. Have you seen Tommy Morrison? Now he has HIV, right? Oh Dude. You, you haven't seen shit. You haven't seen Tommy Mars. What does he really skinny? Oh my God, dude, you wouldn't even believe it. First of all, he looks like, like, he's like, they just grabbed him from under a bridge, pulled the needle out of his arm and just washed him down and put them in front of a camera. I mean, he couldn't look any an unhealthy. Wow. And it's, it's so sad to listen to him talk because you know, at one point in time, you know, you go back to like when he was on rocky dude, he was a movie star. Okay. This fucking guy was with Sylvester Stallone in a movie and he plays Tommi Gunn. He's out there not to be like, he's a fucking star of the movie next two semesters alone.

Speaker 1:          01:32:39       It's God damn Tommy Nelson. I all I remember is that movie was so bad that when they do, uh, rocky marathons, they always leave part five out. Did you notice that? They never get the five. How quick is he? Almost like it wasn't how he did rocky six. He's lucky. He's out of his fucking mind. He's got to be out of his fucking mind.

Speaker 4:          01:33:05       What are you looking for looking for Tommy Morrison interview and you just have to say shit. Yeah, it doesn't even, it doesn't even look real man. It doesn't even look real. It, you'll, you'll, it's, it's, it's scary. Nobody was more nervous than him

Speaker 1:          01:33:18       fighting. That was always his, something he had to overcome before every one of his fights. Like they talk about her in an interview is like the pre fight stuff is we'll, how nervous will he be and will it have, how will it affect his cart? He Oh, right. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:33:33       Shit, right? Yeah. He, that poor guy, man. He always had a hard time

Speaker 1:          01:33:38       and amazing left hook for a white heavy weight. He was the last great white heavyweight, not including the European sound. Call them regular whites. Those are regular wines. I'm talking about like a west goes the clinicals. I don't count Russian does that doesn't count. What? Are They Armenian or something? They're a Lithuanian. No, they're the Russian. There's strict Gresham. Wow. Why do I want to say, um, I don't know why I don't count the Ukrainian. I might be wrong. I guess that's why does Fuck Huh? Yeah, I would say that's why it's fun, man. That's okay. Okay. Okay. All right. American whites and say that the last great American white heavy weight was Tommy Morrison, right? Yeah. There wasn't anybody else. Gerry Cooney, Gerry Cooney before him and Tex Cobb beforehand, and that's it. I remember when I was in high school. I want to Gerry Cooney to beat Larry Holmes because he was white cause I couldn't believe because this one I was fighting, I couldn't believe how bad white dudes would get their asses kicked.

Speaker 1:          01:34:38       Oh, he's like, I was always rooting for white guys like Bobby Chez because you feel sorry for him. Love Bobby Chez because he was super intelligent. He was a member of Mensa. You remember when Bobby chairs just do, I don't know why Bobby Chez stopped doing boxing commentary, but he was my all time favorite. He was my favorite. I love it because first of all, he was the real deal. He's a fucking animal. Bobby. Bobby Chaz. Whoa. What about Vinny Paz? The ends, that one. That sound was me. Ladies and Gentlemen, he fought Roy Jones jr sound man. Remember he don't touch it. He went a whole round without touching Roy Jones Jr. Yeah. Let me see if this shit works. I think it should work.

Speaker 4:          01:35:12       Do you hear that okay? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:35:14       that this is, I'm going to show, this is a really recent Tommy Mars. It Shit. Can you hear that? I get here. It is. It gonna hurt me. Tell me the headphones though. It's not really coming through the headphones, but should be

Speaker 3:          01:35:37       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:35:39       Here we go. Here he is. Look at him because it was worth it and then it stopped.

Speaker 3:          01:35:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       he looks like the Little Kid's father on a Freddy got fingered the little kid that always gets fucked up. His father,

Speaker 4:          01:36:06       my mother was a stay at home mom

Speaker 1:          01:36:13       then I was only out of school for a year. And when I was just thinking here in high school, which was a 1988 and my mother wanted me to fight in the Kansas city gold gloves exactly the same age. I graduated in 98 too, you know. And uh, once I started getting into that mindset, kicked here wardrobe, totally focused on it and, and you know, the fighting is what I love, you know, and I dropped the hat. I mean it's just when I was put here to do whatever it takes to win, that's what I'm willing to do.

Speaker 3:          01:36:54       What the fuck man?

Speaker 1:          01:36:57       He looks like he's 65. It's incredible. I feel bad. He's 42 years old. That dude at one point in time, first of all, must have been getting train loads of pussy. It must've been just stopping off at his house. Yeah. He's the first guy. First guy ever to get HIV from straight sex. I mean who knows? I mean the other dude must just wore his deck out. Yeah, and then he went crazy and gut like chest implants. Have you seen that yet? He, for folks who don't know, just Google that and take a look at that. You want to see what's, what's really

Speaker 4:          01:37:29       crazy guy got implants in his chest. This thing is making noise here. The guy got an implants like like stripper implants to make his boobs bigger. That's if that's not a sure sign of you losing your fucking marbles. Yeah. Someone needs to pull you aside and go, dude, what do you, what are you smoking? What's going on here man? You're gonna what? You're gonna get a boob job. You know what I'm saying? He's your man, dude. He just gained glamor. Her sexy. Now it's up titties. Tired of doing bench. It just outside of benching. Hard to benching, kept a lot of his other muscles but, but just our own Jorma tinnies probably just missed having full Ted's given good manly. I got really big. You think girls that there'd be, some girls are in the fake boobies. I like fake packs. I don't think a man is allowed to pull off fake shit.

Speaker 4:          01:38:20       That's what girls could wear. Wigs. Girls could wear a hair weaves and fake eyelashes and Vicon have fake teeth. They're going to have everything as long as it look good lens. It looks good. I mean it was my, I did a bit in my recent special about how fake tits confused a lot of people because everyone knows that they're fake. There's no confusion whatsoever that they're fake. It's so worst trick ever. Cause it's a trick that everybody knows is an incision. There's a bag of water. They stuffed it inside and stretch the skin out and then stitched it all up and we don't care. We'll go here like, yeah, we can't make some stick out. Like we're, we're s that shape is so primitive. It's so primally satisfying when a girl has a great body and a girl has nice tits and they do not have to be big.

Speaker 4:          01:39:04       You know, I don't, I don't, it doesn't bother me. I like small tits. It doesn't, it doesn't bother me at all. As long as she has a nice body. Like a girl with a nice ass is like, it's so much more important than, than fake boobs. Yeah. When I take a shower, my girlfriend's hair extensions are all, I can't in the shower and I don't give a shit. Like you wouldn't care. I call it Brittany or to badge in if you had hair extensions. Oh Man. And she, you know, if like you ever gotten a fight with the chicks should call you on that show. How bout some level you're not insecure. How about your fucking hair extensions? Huh? How about celebrities that were two pays and everyone knows it's to pay and then I just can't stop. Yeah. Like Burt Reynolds, like he, he'll like joke about it.

Speaker 4:          01:39:42       I don't think he can do anything. I think Burt Reynolds is at this this point where it's become like a Joan Rivers sort of a thing where it's just, this is off the tracks and into the woods. You're nuts. It's got to the point where like, he's crazy. He's, he's constantly getting in his face, like pulled back and g's ever see Kenny Rogers back when he had his, uh, you got to know and the whole loop, he was old than the 70. [inaudible] when the phone, well, he got a lot of crazy plastic surgery now. He doesn't even look like himself anymore. It looks like a totally different human beings. Yeah, I dunno man. So that's a weird thing. You gotta you gotta let it go when your face starts falling apart, you just got to take up fishing. Find yourself a hobby man, you know, and take it from me. The guy who had hair transplants, you know, it was one of the dumbest things I ever did. I thought it was going to be able to fix my hair loss with surgery. Not even considering the fact that it leaves this big chunk of meat scar in the back of your head. You know, they take care out of here and move it up here. It's ridiculous, you know, and it scars you for life. Like you can never make that decision go away. The infomercials are fucking killer. You know what dude?

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       There's like, he has three chicks, he's in a pool, he's got a full head of hair.

Speaker 4:          01:40:58       You can work for some people. So for some people it's good if it was good for me for awhile, but the problem is like, I do a joke about it saying that it's like moving a bunch of really healthy people into a neighborhood where everybody's dying. Cause that's what it's really like. All the other hair starts falling out too. Like it's destined. Most of it's destined to fall out like half. You know? Most people in my family on my mom's side, they're like kind of half fish, bald, like all over here, a little bit bottle with it. It's going, it's going to go, it's going to go. So if you patch up the spots where it's gone a little bit and then you look, I'm pretty good for a couple of years and then the other spots start falling off and then what are you going do? Are you going to keep implanting hair? Their asshole after a while becomes embarrassing. It becomes stupid. Yeah. It becomes like a little trap that you've fos, like forced yourself into. I go, I go to this trap, I gotta take care of this gross hair. Now I gotta figure out how to fucking make it look like there's more of it than it is. Yeah. I should be totally bald by now. You say that man. But you know, I just don't, I think you're wrong. I think I missed,

Speaker 2:          01:41:54       I stopped at Man. I started, I was so worried about my hair because growing up I had long hair and those backward long hair got you mad pussy and it was everything to me. I would have nightmares about having short hair, you know, and I was nine 10 so funny. I'll never forget my aunt my, cause you used to have nightmares of having short hair. Yeah. I used to have nightmares of what I met Eddie.

Speaker 4:          01:42:14       He used to wear like a Hindu rap. He used to, he used to do Jujitsu would like his, his hair would be like tied up in some fucking scuba diving outfit.

Speaker 2:          01:42:22       Yeah. I, we used to tie it, uh, I used to tie my hair used to go down to my waist. I would like double up the ponytail and then I used to wear just a Bandanna Bro. Like fucking axl rose. And then I would put ear guards over it just to hold a Bandana in place. People thought I was worried about my ears. I really wasn't worried about Myers. I just needed something to hold the Bandana up. She'd be hair in place. Yeah. And then some guy down in that when the Machados we're down in Redondo beach, some surfer dude goes, Bro, man, you should just wear a divers hood, man. I could diverse HUD. You mean like Jacques Cousteau goes so you're going with chocolate is still put on a mask. You know, the shit that's all around is that I ended up going to a surf shop.

Speaker 2:          01:43:01       This dude told me where I went to the surf shop, bought a diver side, I could die a scuba fucking store, bought a divers hood and I would wear in the divers would on its own and grappling cause it did hold on my shit together. That would look fucking ridiculous. But with a big ass your guards that got the biggest ones do, they were marooned giant ear guard so that people really didn't notice that I was wearing scuba gear and and I competed with that motherfucker. People always, people still come up to me to stay cause dude I remember seeing you at an old Joe Merera tournament man and use your, the duties to where the scuba gear. So it's basically a rash guard helmet sort of a thing. Yeah. That's Kinda dope. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:43:40       The, the problem with all the scrapes and scratches and shit you get, that's where you could possibly get ringworm and staff. I like, I've been wearing tights lately and that you feel like a dancer out there. You feel something a little funny about a man wearing tights but I got over that shit really quick.

Speaker 2:          01:43:55       What's wrong with g pants, man. I like the pants. I think better protection with the tights. I don't know. I think it's skin tight everywhere. He just liked to show off your mark and Mugler legs. That's what I like. I like just walking in with my big Hams. Let everybody know what the fuck is up. Yeah man. When and all my uncles went bald, like in their thirties. And my aunts knew how much my hair meant to me and my answered say, Ah, I'll never forget my aunt patty goes, oh look, because we're all, we all lose our hair. Plus we're born with a ridiculous large, uh, forehand. Like all my aunts think they're losing their hair because they have a giant forehead. So we're born with giant foreheads and I don't know, my aunt patty, I was 19 hair longer than a motherfucker. Oh No.

Speaker 2:          01:44:35       In the height of metal, the height of metal. Um, my aunt patty goes, oh look, he's losing his hair. Ah, you're going to be all sad. Would you go bald? And I'm like, oh, so right away, right away. I'm like, fuck. But that was good because, because that motivated me to go get some Rogaine and back then you need a prescription to get Rhogam. I had to go to a doctor. The doctor's like, you're 19 years old, he'd do it in here. I'm like, you know what, I'm gonna start early and I just terrified of losing my hair. So I've been on Rogaine since I was 19 so you jumped on it way before it would ever kicked in. Yup. Will you taking the Propecia and everything? I took, I took Rogaine from 19 to 30 and when I was 30 in 2000 that's when they end.

Speaker 2:          01:45:16       Propecia came on and then I switched to Propecia from 30 to 40 didn't use Rogaine at all in my thirties it was just a pill. Every day I take a pill. It was beautiful. It keeps the hair on dude. There's where it works, right? I should be bald by now. I really should be. I'm looking, I have there. I have, cause I've been diligent about just like vitamins. I was trying to hold onto my youth my whole life. I was holding onto the youth and, and uh, you know, at, at 40, I decided to go back to rogue game because I just thought, you know what, I don't like taking a pill every goddamn day. Who Know that I could, I could easily, they actually think it provide for me.

Speaker 4:          01:45:48       It can help prevent prostate cancer. But who knows what, it doesn't. The other end, I didn't like taking it because when I was taking it, it was a fucking with my libido and I didn't even realize it was until I got off of it until I ran out of it. I'm awesome. I had these just monster boners all the time and I was like, what is going on? And a feel. I boner, everybody's different, you know, they say it only affects a certain percentage of people. I know other people that are, they've had the same problem and I know other people that actually say that it made him Hornier. Oh, what the fuck? That's all about it. But it's uh, you know, it, it blocks DHT and apparently DHT is necessary for something, some brain function, something athletic function. Something, I dunno. Yeah man. I Dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:46:30       It's funny though. The whole situation is funny. The, there's just clinging to youth, you know, and it's funny you're open about it. You knew, you know, talk about it really openly. Like, Hey man, I'm just trying to clean the youth. But for a lot of people that's like a really shallow thing to say. Like I know a lot of people who consider themselves very well educated and they, they consider to be a pretty astute and our understanding of how other people see them. And so they avoid saying shit like that. They avoid saying shit like I'm just trying to hold onto my youth. They don't want to admit that because it's a frivolous thing. It's not a, not a thing for a serious man to consider, but the reality is nobody likes it and that nobody, nobody wants to reality and to death feels good to look good.

Speaker 4:          01:47:11       Anybody that says that it doesn't feel good to look good, they're full of shit. If it feels good to look good, I'm just trying to feel good as much as possible. That's all you want to, you want your body to work well too. The difference between you and a lot of other people's, you're always using your body for Jujitsu. So because of that, your body is like a race car. I mean, we've had these conversations before we talk about lifting. It's like when, when you concentrate on a rigorous strength and conditioning program, you decide what kind of engine your race car has. You know? And if you're one of those motherfuckers like, what's that dude's name? He used to train at your place to wrestle. Eric, a really strong guy. Fuck's his name. Eric number four in the nation that got Bradley or Bradley Dude. I remember doing drills with this guy and we were doing neon stomach drills and this motherfucker, I got a pretty good neon stomach.

Speaker 4:          01:47:59       I can hold some dude's down. This motherfucker launched me through the air like, like he had like ridiculous, like physical strength, like ridiculous physical strength. And when you talked about it, he was like, he, he would never miss his lift. I remember he was talking about at once. So I gotta get my lift in. I don't miss my left. It was all like, I don't know what the exactly the lift was, but it was very obviously like a series of strength and conditioning was like you're like clean and press or something like that with a lot of those. Like you ever see the Randy coture set that he does? No. Randy is a fascinating one because Randy does it all with real lightweights. He does it with like a a barbell, a big bar bout with like a 45 not even, not even. Yeah, like a 25 on each side.

Speaker 4:          01:48:37       Really? Yeah Dude. He but he doesn't stop. I mean it's, it's, it's a funnel of exercises, a fuck load of reps and what he does, he says what that does is really much more mimics fighting than full blast bench presses and full blast squats and it's more like for muscular endurance. It's a motherfucker, dude. I tried it once. It's a mother, father, full body stuff. Yeah, a lot of full box of, lot of lunges, a lot of bent over rows, all sorts of different shit he does. It's like a, there's a whole series of I'm Randy has them online. You know what's really made a difference in my list. Did I? I love doing squats way more now than ever because of these shoes. These are vibrant toe shoes. Eddie, Eddie Bravo. Where's took dude, you just put your dirty foot on my mug. Now I've got a disk.

Speaker 4:          01:49:19       That's very much it. Yeah, but it's in my house. Someone's got to drink out of it. Out of my house. These Vibram shoes are the best. Don't drink that spot. We just touched your dirty feet on it, man. Oh Dude. I can't believe you did that. Dammit. Doing squats with what these things are. It feels so good. Yeah. I need to take into him. Steve Maxwell got me into working out barefoot. I do all my lifts in barefoot now. Every house. What does he think about these shoes? He loves him. Yeah. He likes those. He, he's a big advocate of flat minimalist shoes. Yeah, I've got to, um, there's a box right over there and with a, another pair of their, they're not toe shoes, but they're minimalist shoes. Um, yeah, I think for lifting weights and for training, they're the best. Yeah. The toes. A lot of people are weird, like they don't like wearing them.

Speaker 4:          01:50:00       It looks stupid. It looks silly. But uh, I think if you could get them and they fit right for me, I had a hard time getting some of the toes in, but once I got him in, man, it's pretty God damn comfortable. And you really do feel your toes working as individual units, which doesn't happen when it's like one big fixed sneaker. Yeah. In a big fixed sneaker. It's like trying to like if you put sneakers on your hands, okay. And then try to do bench press with it, how good would that be? It wouldn't be so good. You wouldn't really have that kind of a good control. Exactly. And you're gripping the ground with your toes. Yeah. It's so huge. I love, I love walking now. Just walking is awesome. I'm a serious, maybe I'll get over it in a month or so, but I really enjoy these shoes.

Speaker 4:          01:50:39       Sell much, changing the way I just function every day. I saw some boot versions. They were like, uh, like it looked like hobbit feet. It was on Tim Ferriss, Twitter. Somebody had tweeted it. It's like the same company that does it. What does the company that makes sure as Vibram? Yeah, they're vibrams but it's like a boot, like a tan leather boots like you could wear and like I guess you'll be allowed to wear that and go out to eat at a nice restaurant and he'd be a shoe. Yeah, they've got to make some cool looking dressy ones like we were talking about earlier, like puts it make for on top of it or something of diamonds or something like that. Make up the evil fake dressy ones. Man, there's something weird about someone walking towards you and you could see their toes moving. You know?

Speaker 4:          01:51:20       It's like if for a guy like flip flops or weird enough, right? You're out there showing your toes hanging around, flip flop in with people. But when you're wearing, it's like you're out at a nice restaurant and a guy. I can see your toes move. There's something about like our idea of what it is to go out where that doesn't agree with us. You know, what are you doing? You trying to get attention with your silly shoes. You want the fucker? Why can't you remember regular shoes? Like a regular person? Why are you going to be the one guy who stands out? You silly bitch. People talk shit on the shoes like my girlfriend didn't want like I want her to, I wanted them for a year and she's,

Speaker 6:          01:51:55       she would

Speaker 4:          01:51:56       bring it up to a friend's and they would laugh at me. Oh he want to get those shoes. Those shoes are ridiculous. I'll you know, and then finally, finally I told her either I'm going to get them. Did he brought, do what you need to get down with the fanny pack. That's what you need to get dealt with. I, I traveled with a fanny pack sign. I traveled strong feeling. I got do two little pockets. Oh son, it's so much better. I put my money, I got my cell phone, all my bullshit too. Little zipper pockets, little chapstick in there. Boom. Schelok log. Boom. Come on, man. I leave little. Uh, I have uh, headphones. I have my little headphones or beats, a little tiny ones. I keep those in there. The ear buds. I'm always down to listen to music if I'm stuck anywhere.

Speaker 4:          01:52:33       If I'm traveling, I don't go anywhere without that fucking fanny pack. Yeah, plane ticket. Oh, where's it go? And very practical. It is dude. You just, you gotta. You gotta step up and claim back. I take it back. How was it a dude who carry a man purse for awhile? I really remember it used to bring around your CD's everywhere. You brought him everywhere. You never wanted to be in a situation where you wanted to give some anyone you didn't exactly have one on. Yeah, always passed now. Fuck cds. You got mp3s now. Is it an amazing cds? Just the solid media is almost useless. It's on its way out. Like I go to border books, you know, and look around. They always have like a back section where they sell movies and in cds and Shit. I look, you know, I think it's funny, you know, the CD section just keeps getting smaller and smaller.

Speaker 4:          01:53:18       You go to best buy, just getting smaller and smaller. We're going to be all living in the cloud. Dude sent me a virtual bookstore and the future, right, like a three month thing that you walk around and he'd just pick out the books. Well, I mean it sort of is there now if you have a kindle or if you have a one of those iPads with the, the I book application, you just go scroll. I'll take that book right now. Bang downloads, images and all guys. I found out Marilyn Manson came out with the new album a couple of days ago. Just, Oh, I just buy it on my phone instantly. Crazy. I had my phone on me at all times. Can you buy it with three g or do you have to be connected to the Internet? I buy all my shit on three G. Really? Yep. So you'd get in, download the whole album on three g.

Speaker 4:          01:53:59       Wow. You know those, um, those cards that they sell you, those uh, Internet cards and they have a certain amount of bandwidth do I downloaded one movie off iTunes and they sent me a message and I used up like 50% of my bandwidth. One movie. How much bandwidth do I get? You assholes. There was hardly any more bandwidth. I mean, how big is it a movie when you get a movie on iTunes and never buy movies on iTunes? How big can it be though? I mean, I would guess big few gigs. I'm not, I'm still not sure what a Gig is. Gigabyte. It's a thousand megabytes. I know it stands for, I know, but I don't know how big that is. Um, a Gig is like, like if you have a big ass photo of a very, very high resolution photo, maybe it can be one Gig, like a, a like a good size porno film that you can save on your hard drive.

Speaker 4:          01:54:52       It's an Avi file and you could watch it for like 15 minutes, man, 28 Gig if it's really high rate a breaking down pouring again. But it's all depends on the CODEC. So that's the thing about, uh, there's, there's a lot of different standards when it comes to avionics and pigs, mov files, flash files. There's a lot of different things. I mean we live in incredible times and there's a lot of parallel evolution of different sort of formats for videos. You know, it's, it's pretty incredible. And then blu rays, you know, he can't play brew Blueway on your laptop, a blu rays. That shit when it comes to like high definition, you know, you watch it, you go, you got a blueberry player at home. You ever watch the ads on my playstation? I think. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Isn't that incredible? I mean how incredible is a playstation?

Speaker 4:          01:55:34       It comes with a blue ray player and you watch those. I mean we'll look real bad ass movies like Avatar and Blu Ray. Ah, stunning. You can't tell me that doesn't feel good. Like that asshole that lives in the caves, that guy who gave up on money, you don't get to experience Avatar Douche bag. You don't get to experience it. You need money for that. James Cameron is not going to work for fucking food. Okay. If a guy's going to create something like Avatar, he wants to live in a castle and drive a private jet, you know, you gotta, you gotta pay a guy like James Cameron and make a fucking movie like that and you're not gonna, you're not gonna get to see that while you're eating beans out of a can underneath a bridge. You think dictators going to be good? No, it doesn't look that great.

Speaker 4:          01:56:12       It doesn't look good and I keep hearing it's terrible. Oh really? Yeah. Unfortunately I don't have a huge Ali g fan. This is how hugely allergy fan I am. I bought an a different DVD player because the DVD player that I bought would play DVDs from the UK because there's two different regions and apparently like we used to be cheap DVD players were all region like a cheap one, like a really expensive one, but only be, you could only play American DVDs on it, but a cheap one for some reason. Some of them they had like all regions and it eventually they phased that shit out. I think, I don't think you can get all regions anymore. I might be wrong, but the point is, I bought a special DVD player just for European videos so I could watch the ology show and I got them all off the Amazon website, the UK, Amazon, amazon.co.

Speaker 4:          01:56:57       Dot. UK. They have their own version of Ama and a bunch of different shit, like all these allergy episodes that I never show saw like Ali, Geez movie. What was that movie allergy in the House do that movie is fucking brilliant. You and I remember you and I washed it. We got banked as fuck and we watch Ali g in the house and I got this DVD player specifically to watch Ali g. But when I watched that, the ad for that, I mean I could be wrong, but I watched the ad. I was like, Whoa, what happened here? Like this looks like a mess. I see it. There is a chance. Like maybe he's holding all the good stuff to cook because Bruno and Borat, we're fucking brilliant. Brilliant. I've seen Bruno probably a hundred times more. Laura was so god damn good. He's so good, man.

Speaker 4:          01:57:39       He's so hilarious when he's on, but you know everybody has fuck ups. I don't know if this is going to be one, but I keep hearing bad things. Oh really? Yeah. I keep hearing they're delaying it and reshooting things and trying to fix things. Damn. I hope. I hope I'm wrong, but it could be also that people like Freddy got fingered. They don't get it. You know, like Freddy got fingered. You and I both agree. It's hilarious. So crazy or ridiculous movie, but a lot of people didn't get it. They didn't like it. They didn't want to go with it. You know? It was a trip when we talked about Freddy got fingered last time I was on the show. Tom Green. Mike sent me a tweet. Oh, that's cool. Like Holy Shit. I worshiped Tom Green back when he was doing, when he was doing just the small time shit on MTV. You ever met him? I met him once when you did his shall at his house in the Hollywood hills. That was fun, man. Does he still do it though? I don't know. I don't know. I gotta. I got gotta call that dude. I gotta get him on my podcast or go on his or whatever. I did his too. He did want to add Kevin Smith's place, the smog cast place in Hollywood. He's a great guy. He's going to be out at the Canyon club zone. Yeah man. Ay

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       all his early shit. I worshiped Tom Green, you know, he's a loving standup now. Really? He's getting into it. He's a dude. He's a stand up. He's, he's just stand up all over the country. All over the world. Wow. Yeah. I've watched videos of him kicking ass in Australia. You Dude, he's doing great. He's doing great. Well he's a funny guy, man. And he just, you know, just for a long time just didn't do standup and then he just, I remember talking, I was like, I'm really getting into this now we're getting an understand up. Who's really excited about it? You know, it was like something new to him and it was all his, he could like, he had sort of, or he was one of the first guys to really branch out on the Internet and do his own shit. Yeah. With his show, the Tom Green showed live on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          01:59:18       It was really one of the first guys and then I think he just decided, you know what, man? Why the fuck am I sitting around waiting for someone to give me a show when I know I'm funny. I know I'm weird, but I'm, what am I going to do? I'm going to wait for someone. We make something happen. Let me go make something happen. I love that. I just loved that he did that. I respect that so much school, Tom Green's to put dog shit on a mic and just, just see how people stupid. We're stupid. People were on the street when they see a camera and a guy come up to him with the mic, they are so thrilled about being on TV. They don't want to believe it's bullshit. They see the shit right in front of their face. Literally, he'll put dog shit on a mic and start talking to people and interviewing people and they'll smell it.

Speaker 1:          01:59:58       They'll look at it and still continue with the interview, hoping, just not even thinking that they're being goofed on. They don't want to believe that shit. They want to believe that they're really on TV and it's real. You know the crazy shit. He was an innovator as far as doing like really ridiculous shit. He was very original with his, his whole show. Fucking that dead Moose on the side of the highway pulls over. I swear he was ridiculous and over and a nice fucking guy, man. Tom Green is a nice fucking guy. I always enjoyed being around that guy. He's just a really good dude to be around. He's fun. And then this world of Weirdos that you meet, you know you can meet some, some people that are famous that are just fucking crazy or weird or nuts or too much or you can't take them or the two too egocentric or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:00:46       It's nice when you meet a guy like Everlast. You might nice, nicely meet a guy who could just hang out. He's just a regular dude man. Or a guy like Tom Green. It's just a regular dude, you know? So we're, we're so lucky being exposed out here and especially doing like a podcast, you're exposed to so many really extraordinary people. So many interesting people. We think of all the, I mean from the fringe to out from Alex Jones, you know, fascinating to got to Michael Rupert, you know, fascinating God. Alex Jones on the, on this podcast. But we're going to work it out because there was a, there was a mistake and I actually, oh, Alex and apology. There's a company called bent pixels and bent pixels is there, they put ads on people's videos and Marty, yeah, Marty Cordoba, who's a good friend of mine and a good friend of Dana White's and a great guy. And we were working together this on

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       videos, but unfortunately some videos were claimed. It's not just videos of my standup. They have like an algorithm and the algorithm goes and looks for your name. So when it goes out and looks for your name, it doesn't necessarily get something that you own. It could be like Joe Rogan on the Alex Jones show. All this algorithm grabs that thinking that there's a copyright claim to be made. Or You could put an ad on that video. Well you can't put it down on the video because it's me and a guest of Alex Jones show. So of course they release it and it's a mistake and they, you know, are trying to correct and apologize for everything, but it's a sloppy algorithm, you know, I'm sure they're upset about it and there it's unfortunate, but they're not trying to rip anybody off. And then shortly not trying to claim copyright from me on stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:02:19       That's not my stuff. What they're trying to do is like, you know, there's a lot of people that put your standup online. There's a lot of my videos that are online and other people's videos as well. And there's ads on those videos and these, these videos on other people's sites. So other people are getting like, like I've clicked on a link of my own. That was one of my heckler videos. And I watched an ad that somebody else put up on my video and like of me. And I'm like, that's hilarious. Like this guy's making money. And I looked down, it was like thousands and thousands of views. I don't have any how many hundred thousand views, this fucking video guy. But I'm like, how crazy is that? This guy, whatever, and add pays you. I don't know what it pays you, but this guy's making money from my video.

Speaker 4:          02:02:57       That's kind of crazy bullshit. So when Marty confronted me about it or confirm or offered me rather this and discussed it with me, I shouldn't say confronted, cause that sounds like hostile. It doesn't confront it presented, presented the proper word. When Marty presented it to me, I certainly did not have any intention of uh, it, you know, connecting itself to someone else. And there's a lot of people complaining about it, but most people don't understand that it's just a mistake. It's an algorithm and they're not trying to be sleazy. They'll fix everything. And I'm sorry, but uh, but motherfucker got bills trying to get paid. Trying to keep that money rolling in dog. It's hard to make money off the Internet, right? Yeah. It's hard. It's hard to make money off the Internet. Yeah, their yard. So that's the thing everybody's trying to monetize. Like they try to monetize podcasts.

Speaker 4:          02:03:43       Like there's ways that people have like clubs you can join like the VIP program and you get a free podcast every week and extra podcast and a tee shirt and this center of that. And trying to figure out how you get someone to spend x amount of money. You know, like a lot of dudes like Kevin Smith, they were asking him for a Ad Free Shit. Like a lot of people were asking him for Ad Free Shit. So he decided to make, he's got like two versions, like his regular podcast, completely free, but you've got to listen to a few ads, you know, they've got to pay the bills and then he has a membership offer where you could get that and then you get the no adversion pay like five bucks a month or something like that. Yeah, it's totally reasonable. You know, and you'd want to support it if you really did enjoy it.

Speaker 4:          02:04:22       It's not as long as it's like five bucks a month, you know? It's like, like my comedy special that I'm going to release online, that's going to be five bucks and it has to be five or first of all, cause Louis C k the first guy to do it and make this a popular choice. He charged five bucks. So you can't charge more than the innovator. You know, he's completely fair in the right way to do it. He did it perfect and you've got to follow his lead. You shouldn't charge any more than that. So I think, I think there's nothing wrong with what you know anybody's doing by asking for some sort of a membership fee to just to, just to work off some of the bills. You know, there's a lot of people that would be happy to pay five bucks to listen to Adam Carolla every month.

Speaker 4:          02:04:59       I mean, it's a part of their daily grind. I mean for what costs? A couple cups of coffee a month, you know? I mean, I don't know how much he charges, but Adam has some sort of a Ustream thing, but for a lot of people, man, they fucking love that show. Adam Carolla show is super fucking popular. That's a, he's a big part of a lot of people's lives. This is not wrong as long as it's reasonable. The beautiful thing is that it can be reasonable like five bucks and because of the Internet it really could benefit the artists like you, like you know your, your Jujitsu website, five bucks benefits you man, it goes right to you. You know? Whereas me, when I'm selling it five bucks benefit, it goes right to me. It's not like the old days where you had to go through some sort of a manufacturing company.

Speaker 4:          02:05:38       He would put the DVD together for you in a marketing company. He would put it on the shelves and talk to where we got Jean at Walmart and you know, you had to get in and all these different places. This was just a couple of years ago, man, just a couple of years ago, one of my last DVD deals that I did, I remember, you know, one of the big things, I had to go and sit and I had a a meeting with these dudes that are this big DVD distribution company and they were pitching to me how they can get my DVD and all these different stores all over the country and this is what's important. What's important is, you know, you can't have anything on the shelves and can't get onto Walmart. If you can't get in a Walmart, you're really doomed. You're doomed to sell these things. This is the new reality. Like how to get into Walmart, so you had to have something knows he can't like cab call, call it like shit talking one on one, like the name of my message board. You can never have a a DVD named that because they wouldn't sell it. It has to be squeaky clean. There's just a few years ago. Hmm. It's fascinating when this is all going, man.

Speaker 2:          02:06:30       Yeah. You don't need any of that shit anymore. I'm, I'm starting to sell, I'm in the process of switching manufacturers now. I'm handling all my merchandise now. We've got new shirts coming, new designs and hoodies, new rash guards knew, uh, short all that's coming. It's going to take a little time because it's really expensive. But my store on my website hasn't been running for, since my website went up. I've been letting melee, uh, uh, that fight where handle all my merchandise. Like, is this too much for me to handle it for awhile? But now I'm going to handle everything and, and um, you know, take over. So it's really exciting when we're talking about this before the podcast, it's really exciting to be able to have a concept like what's going on? It's like a 10th planet heads are designing shirts and I'm like, Oh shit, I want that design. I send it over to my manufacturer. He makes it, we make it happen. Sell it on the website. Boom. Just like that. It's on like donkey Kong. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's a strange world we live in, dude. Yeah. So it's like, like right now is is a bad time to buy by 10th planet gear. We're just getting it rolling. You could still, I'm allowing to sell out

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       all their stuff. Maili you can go to 10th planet gear.com Malay owned that, um, until the end of the year they're allowed to sell everything off and, and, and while I build up my own merchandise, um, it's going to be official 10th planet brand. It's not like an cause. It used to be only wants to learn Jujitsu from your website, which is more interesting to most people here. What, how did, how did they do that? If they want to learn Jujitsu online, is it possible to just go to a regular school and like learn all your shit online and then go to the school and just, yeah, you could bring a laptop, bring uh, bring an iPhone. Do you have an iPhone versions of it? Yup. Yup. Um, you can watch it on iPad and all that stuff. Basically it's most traditional Brazilian jujitsu schools have like one or two guys that are into temp planet techniques.

Speaker 1:          02:08:20       And so you could be that guy, you could go to a Gracie Baha school and not jump on my website and for five bucks extra, you get to learn all this stuff that they're not teaching to there. Cause most Gracie Barra schools don't teach rubber guard. They don't teach all the stuff that we saw the Korean Zombie do. It's a lot of great schools. There are a lot of them out there. There's a million of them. You know, there's a credible lunch I have, there's only like 30 10 plan in schools. There's probably 500 Gracie Bajas not more theirs. They're everywhere. They're huge. It's incredible. How would you do to, is taken off man. So it's just, it's just a testament of what a fun way it is to exercise. So I saw this thing man, and I had to talk to you about it cause it's completely ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          02:09:01       Phillip Corso, you know who that dude is? Yeah. The, uh, the guy who was a, he was one of the, well he was one of the people that supposedly was, was there and saw the um, the, the, the, the spacecraft. Wasn't he at Roswell? Yes. He was one of the actual people. Yes. His son or someone want to try to find the, find the actual, the actual article because someone in his family, it was Philip Corso son reveals that Roswell craft was a time machine. Quiet like you crazy. Motherfucker did. Anything's possible though. I know anything's possible. That's crazy. I mean it is crazy. It is crazy. Yeah. But reality is crazy. It is real thing as possible. Shit. Who knows like the truth, like the tea. But I love these things because these, these revelations, they're always in like some weird hotel conference room. There's like a podium and this is like a bad slide show. This is, you know, not, not quite fascinating. And this guy talking about it, he's talking about how the, it's the, in the presentation, I'll just read it. It says the details, the alleged Roswell craft or talked about at length a particular interest was information about the so called extraterrestrial biological entities, which contained two brains. One was organic and thought to control the beings and the other one was laced with crystal electronics. That's still not understood to this day was thought to connect

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       the beings with the craft through time. It is purported that these beings are essentially artificial intelligence from our own future and that their crash caused a bifurcation of our timelines and altered our history. The most mind boggling aspect of this story and the theory that the air force, et Cetera are operating under is that as a result of this timeline split and the subsequent advancement in technology from reverse engineering that we are the military are now on a timeline of technological evolution that will eventually create the very same craft and beings that actually crashed in Roswell in 1947 whoa. That's an insane shit you imagine. That's incredible. I mean, it sounds completely ridiculous and I'm sure this guy's nuts out of his fucking head. But if he wasn't, just just say, let's just say two to settle out all the skeptics and the people that would be critical of this idea.

Speaker 4:          02:11:27       Imagine if that is how it works. I mean, we're, we're working so hard right now, not we, not yet, not I, but scientists are to figure out all kinds of crazy things that are going to alter the very way we interact with the universe. Look what the fuck's going on with this large Hadron collider. Yeah. Look at this cork gluon plasma that they've created that's like the most dense, thick, like it's some insane amount. Like a sugar cube weighs like 40 billion pounds or something crazy. I mean, they're doing some nutty, nutty shit are working on a time machine right now. I think they could send photons back like seconds at a time or something like that. But they have been working on it for 20 years. I mean a time machine is something that they're actually working on their scientists working on it. The, you know, they're going to start with photons and maybe five minutes in the future, whatever they know, time travel is possible.

Speaker 4:          02:12:15       Einstein said it was possible. I mean, based on the speed Kurt Godel who came up with it, I remember reading about it who's a mathematician, but it needed, you needed something like an object the size of the solar system and it had to be going backwards fucking faster than the speed of light. It's this, there's like a lot of weird shit that happened with the speed of light, something the transverse its axle. If you travel out in space at the speed of light and then like for you know, uh, uh, a week and then come back at the speed of life broke, something like that, that you're going to cut back to a planet that's like 500 years older, older. Yeah. Yeah. That is weird and crazy. Is that, yeah, that's relative to how fast you're traveling. Anything. Anything's possible. It's all nuts, right? Isn't it? But check this out. But it's just that I was right though. We're going to call me a cook, but I just wanted to play this as really quick evidence. This is evidence, this, just listen to it.

Speaker 7:          02:13:08       There's a lot of genealogical research, you know, going back, Dick's family, my family, they said, well, we can amazing tales of people who went west, but one of the things I discovered is that Dick and Barack Obama or eight cousins, why is that? An amazing thing is if you go back eight generations common ancestor, these spiritual beings,

Speaker 4:          02:13:29       that's it. I mean, well there's, that's when that article we read, right? Dick Cheney's wife. That bench is probably crazy. She's living with Dick Cheney. She must be a devil worshiper. Could you imagine if dictate he was your husband? Well, what do you think, honey? Did I do the right thing? Yeah, whatever. 1 million people dead. Whatever. We've got a nice house then I'll fucking bad ass out when it go. Dude, you provided he provided for your family. Let's see that kind of like stick let's Dick Cheney fogger. Do you think he wears like an old mask? A her cape, like he's one of the, the watchmen. Is that what they were? What the fuck is that? What are you doing dude? I was just started trying to apply no bond and have a conversation by myself. I was just trying to find out. You get on that on your laptop sometimes and ignoring me and I'm left the first laptop on a fucking island only for a second to Google something.

Speaker 4:          02:14:21       That's what I was trying to out trying to find the Obama interview of him talking about it. Oh, I don't, I don't really care if they all are related. They all suck about that. They're related, but yeah, but if they are all related, fuck, what does that mean? It means it means that we're living in a, this is all bullshit. Maybe we are living in some sort of a manufactured reality. I had been thinking that more and more lately as things get weirder and weirder. You know, when that Joseph Kony guy and the guy who had the campaign against Joseph Kony and then a few days later he, they made like fucking insane amounts of money and they, the way they had their sponsorship or their charity rather set up, it was really fucked up. Like they got a lot of money out of it before the money actually got to anybody that was, you know, overseas, you know, it was, it was really kind of a scam.

Speaker 4:          02:15:07       But then the guy went crazy and wound up masturbating in the street and San Diego and acting really gay and it flailing his arms around it, talking really gay and they arrested him. He went crazy. But it's almost like you see something like that happen. You see a guy get shamed because people find out that his, his uh, his charity was like a little funky, a little suspicious and then he winds up blown a gas. But like as gasket like that publicly, it almost makes you feel like, who's writing this? This is, this is like, this is a work of fiction. Who's right, who is, who's writing the thing where that wiener guy gets arrested for showing his wiener, who's writing this? You know who's writing it? Who's when? When you see a guy like Mitt Romney and Mitt Romney talked to that kid who was a medical marijuana patient who was like, you gonna arrest me.

Speaker 4:          02:15:53       Am I a criminal? Like this is the only thing that allows me to eat well. I'm not for medical marijuana. I'm not for it. And he just walks away from some poor crippled kid and you're like, really? You think that this guy has the kind of compassion that you want as a man who runs the world? That's a fucking robot. That's an ideological robot. That's a guy who's not addressing a person who is in pain. A person who's just been dealt a terrible hand by life and is telling him that there's a substance that gives me a very unfortunate person, some relief. Oh, I'm not for that. I'm not for your relief. I'm an Iud of empire and I can't see the day light. Did you see that video of Mitt Romney and Obama agreeing on everything? It's all spliced together and they go through every issue, every issue.

Speaker 4:          02:16:36       I may agree on every issue, most issues, most issues like a good like 90% of all the all the big issues and there's video. You can find this on you to video of them going back and forth. They're talking and they're saying the exact same thing and not healthcare. The exact same thing about everything. It's amazing. At the end of the day when you realize how much corporations and big money influence government and then once you realize that, then you will put it together and you realize this is a shell game. The corporation's influenced both sides. They just keep this stupid banter going, that's a stupid tennis game or this has got the ball. Now that guy has got the ball and this guy's got the ball and they just alternate between Democrats and Republicans and it mo money, Mo problems that Democrats are there on specifics, line of problems like sticking their and chicks miles and all kinds of freaky Shit to Clinton did and then the Republicans got their issues too and everybody's got their own little thing.

Speaker 4:          02:17:30       It's a back and forth. Well, gay marriage. I'm not for gay man. What about abortion? I think of the six months is a little with a word of it's rape and they keep this fucking battle. Meanwhile, they just pulling money out of other spots of the world, just fucking attacking thing in the world. It's amazing. I mean if, if you really look at the actual game, how it is played, the game of, of capitalism, the game of, you know, global imperialist capitalism that we're experiencing right now live in here in America and the balls of the Dick that's fucking the world. If you really look at it, it really is an amazing God. That movie. It feels like someone wrote this shit down. Yeah. It feels like dark city. Yeah. As as much as I, I really am obsessed with just, I mean I'm not trying to put together a revolution or an army or anything like that.

Speaker 4:          02:18:17       All I'm, all I'm doing is I'm trying to make as many people aware as possible. Let's not make it that easy for them to fuck us. I'm not going to style it. You know what asked way to influence them. This is what I always say. You're not going to get those Dick Cheney motherfuckers. Those guys are broken that he's been broken since he was a child. What you're going to get is those kids in college that are listening to this and they're realizing, realizing, you know these guys, you know they're in their forties or telling them about life and and they're telling them about it in a very honest way and letting them know, listen man, you are not going to live forever and the only way you're going to enjoy this life is if you create less negative energy. Then you receive from life. If you put forth a positive result and a positive influence and in a positive reaction to you being on this planet, that's how you're going to have a good life.

Speaker 4:          02:19:07       You are not going to have a good life. If it's just me, me, me, [inaudible] taking over the world fucking over everybody you're going to, after awhile you don't realize how much money you have. Once you know, why would you want $100 million when you could be happy and comfortable with 10 or 20 and not have to fuck over the world where they don't even realize it. They're just caught up in this fucking crazy game. You know where a person is super successful and they made $100 million fucking over the world. They probably could have made 30 or $40 million had done it the right way and still been just equally as wealthy. You don't realize $100 million or $50 million, he's crazy assholes that want to own everything. You know what you realize when you don't have enough. You can't afford a good dinner. You can't afford to heat your house.

Speaker 4:          02:19:49       You can't afford to live in a nice neighborhood where your, your kids are safe and they play in front of your house. You can't afford to pay for cable, but once you pay for all that and you have a nice car, you have food on your table, it becomes a matter of what are you trying to get with that money? What do you track? Where are you trying to get your happiness from? Because if you try to get your happiness purely through objects, that shit's ridiculous or purely through monetary accomplishment. That's ridiculous. It's a dead end. It really is a head end. The way to change the world is to let kids know this, let them know, don't get on that path. You can be a successful motherfucker and still have ethics. You can be a successful person and still be a good guy and do the right thing.

Speaker 4:          02:20:26       You can protect the country from the cons of the world without being one of the cons of the world and that's where Shit went wrong. We became cons to protect ourselves from cunts and we've been doing it from the, from the fucking get go. The real problem this country is that there's a lot of us that aren't like you or I, and they're the ones who are representing us in the world. They're the ones who are making all these decisions. They're the ones who are doing all these fucking crazy backroom deals that make all kinds of ridiculous shit. That's horrible for the economy. Legal. Just so a few people can extract millions of dollars from the system and it ain't you and it ain't me man, and there's something you said to me once a long time ago and it really stuck with me and it's a very astute point.

Speaker 4:          02:21:09       You said, we were born into a system that we have no control over. We were born into it and to try to fix it is almost impossible and it really is true. We were born into this thing and we've got no fucking control over it. He saved voting it please man. You really think that Ron Paul would be losing as badly. He is. He is in a lot of these places. It's absolute proof of voter fraud. When it comes to Ron Paul in several different districts, there's been several different videos on an online. One of them I believe was in Maine where they committed voter fraud. Man there they don't want Ron Paul winning anything nobody does across the board. The real reality of our system is that it's designed to make sure everyone doesn't have a say. It's not that everyone has a say. It's an, everyone has a say in who has a say about who has a say.

Speaker 4:          02:21:56       And because of that it's a tiered effect. They able to control it. They block it off at certain ends. You don't really vote for president, you've over representative the representative votes for president. There's all these special interest groups that are funding these politicians and money's coming from fucking soap manufacturers and want to keep pouring a certain amount of shit every year into the river and make it okay. You know? And so it's a mess, man. It's a fucking mess. And the way to fix it is not what these guys that are in place, it's letting these old motherfuckers die off and let it in. The new people come in letting these people though the guys who own Google, these young motherfuckers that are smart and figured shit out and just said, let's just take over everything. Maps, email, fucking what's make a browser, let's make, or an operating system. Let's make phones. Let's make every, let's go crazy. Let's just get nuts. So let's just, I'll control this motherfucker and do it with a company that's ethical. And do it with a company that's nice to their employees, do with a company that gives him a big cafeteria and takes care of everybody. You know,

Speaker 2:          02:22:49       it's nice to know that there's good people out there like anonymous. Yes. I mean look, I mean we have a force out there who knows how strong they really are. You know, cause I hear from people that, Oh yeah, they're shutting down government websites that the government don't even care about, you know, but I don't really know. Yeah, that's, that's what I've heard.

Speaker 4:          02:23:08       Government cares. The government does not want you shutting anything down.

Speaker 2:          02:23:12       The guy that told the guy that told me that he was actually a, um, a friend of the comedian, the Indian comedian, Peter's Russell Peters computers. He was a friend of his, when he did the podcast and he had this, I don't know who he is or what his name was, but he was, that's what he was saying. He seemed to be, uh, an expert on the whole anonymous thing. And he said that they're shutting down websites that really no one cares about, but the perception that they have power is actually giving them the power cause then people rallied behind them and, and, and that kind of, right. So it says it's a good thing that you know, even though they're shutting down, like, like you know, an FBI website that's just like a home page or something, I'm not sure exactly what they're doing, but the perception that they are power, we're actually give them power.

Speaker 2:          02:23:56       Right. Because if everybody, everybody in this country decided to look at the government and look at all the shady shit that's going on. Un UN, UN unbiased way like a detective. If everyone just decided to look at all the evidence and clear their mind and have an open mind, man, I think the power will be shifted back to the people. I think it's just, it's so many people like the, the, the propaganda hours ever really been in the people. You don't have a strong, how would I propagandists. Yeah. Just the fact that that Mitt Romney is, is as the best candidate that the Republicans can come up with. That alone tells you there's some shit.

Speaker 4:          02:24:34       Well, you first of all, for to be a representative to be a president. Okay. We've already established pretty much it. That's just a figurehead with George Bush. We sort of establish that he wasn't really the president. He was the guy that's in that position and they've, you know, whatever, for vote him in whatever. However he got there, he got there and then everything behind the scenes was obviously working without him. The Dick Cheney situation, Dick Cheney was the one who was in the bunker while after all that nine 11 shit was going down, he was the one that was hiding. That guy was essentially the mastermind for the fucking global empire that is the United States. He moved all the pieces in the place, made sure a lot of people have profited and got away with some fucking pretty insane shit. So since that's the case, you got to realize, well, in order to be the figurehead, in order to be the guy, the main guy, you can't have a fucked up past. You can't have like some Herman Cain type shit where you got a lot of bitches on the side and you're banging them. And then you know, national enquirer starts

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       finding out about shit. You can't have that anymore. We, we, there's too much introspective. We're, or there's too much work. It's too much investigative work. They can find out if you did some shady shit and business in the past, they could find out, you know, if you, you know, you fired one of your employees and she charged with sexual harassment and then she's going to tell some crazy story about, you know, you whipped it dick out in the wash room or something. You know, you can't have it. So it leaves who it leaves. How many people, how many people don't have fucking John David? What's that guy's name? Don Davidson. Who? The Guy, the guy that got arrested, I want to say John Davidson, cause he looks like him. The fucking presidential candidate who got caught. He had a a baby with another chick, like a girl who was a videographer on his Toral. Yeah. No, it wasn't Santorum. It was. He's in court right now. Gingrich. You don't even know politicians. You don't know anybody do. I know you'll get grits. Yeah, he's huge. John. I want to say John Davidson, but that's not as fucking name. I know she saw someone on Twitter will tell me what his name is. This poor fuck though. He's, he's doomed.

Speaker 1:          02:26:29       I don't think in our time, dude, we're going to ever see anybody that wants to give the power to the people. I think we just need a much more ethical sense of rule, you know? I don't think given to power to the people. It's real tricky man. The reason why this whole system is set up that way is because way back in the day, the founding fathers, even though they had a great idea what this country could be and great expectations, they also knew you can't just completely give power to the people. You have to have representatives. You can't have the mob. Just make, and people are too easy and manipulate. Paid 13, 13 bloodlines, 13 original states, 13 stars on the flag. That's some conspiracy shit. Like what does the blood, there's supposedly 13 royal bloodlines. And when John Edwards, thanks. Kileo Keel, John Edwards, the psychic? No, John Edwards.

Speaker 1:          02:27:23       Love to spangle I r l two. Yeah. So 13 blood lines. Is that what it was? Yeah, there's, there's a connection between, uh, according to the people that have this, the bloodline mastered all the way back to ancient Sumer 13 bloodlines. So 13 states. It's like they made sure they had someone from each bloodline and that running that state so that it, it stays in the blood. What stays in the family? How could they cut? Possibly keep that going all these years and not have anyone know about it all over youtube. Yeah. But that doesn't mean anything. It's, if it hasn't hit CNN yet talking about it, you know what I mean? Of course. It's not, think about this, the propaganda and the brainwashing that goes on TV is so fucking strong. It's so strong that they can convince most of the people that, uh, tower seven fell because of fires that skyscraper they didn't get hit by plain yogurt isn't impossible. I mean, I don't know shit about architecture. Isn't it possible if they've just did a shit job of that building

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       somehow another fire which uniformly spread through the entire building and caused like the upper layer to collapse and then it all simultaneously collapsed. No Way, man. 1500 architects and engineers, professionals, they called bullshit. You look at it. I wonder, I don't even need to hear the architects of the engine. I don't know. I look at that shit. To me, I'm not that stupid. The government is fucking, the government's crooked is fuck history of being crooked as fuck. That's a controlled demo. I don't need it for people who listen to this and go shut the fuck up. You guys. What are you talking about? Well you need to know what was in building seven cause that's where things get rid built again. Again, Bill, most people think only two towers fell because two planes, a third tower fell. It. It not only did it fall, but it fell at free fall speed, like a controlled demo.

Speaker 2:          02:29:07       Those things take weeks to load that shit. Someone was planning something and all and tower seven wasn't even next to tower one and two there was, well there was four five, six. We're right under it and those got hit and had massive fires and got hit. Not One of those collapsed but a hundred yards away. When I was little fires 47 it wasn't even next to the twin towers. That one fucking get implodes in itself. How stupid the afterbody collide. If you think that if they could and you know you're looking at a bunch of other stuff. They didn't put tower seven in the nine one one commission report, they'd left tower seven out. They didn't even explain it and then people for years they rallied and like what happened at tower seven what happened at tower? So how can we guys aren't talking about it? Well.

Speaker 2:          02:29:56       Then they finally were forced into doing research on it and they came up with the crazy idea that fires made a 47 steel skyscraper collapse all at once. And the only way that shit will collapse all at once, it's all the columns. A central columns are blown out at the same time. How our fire's going to do, it's impossible. I don't know. It's not, I'm just playing completely playing devil's advocate. If I had a bit on video and, and it's on video, if it wasn't on video, if there wasn't on video and people just, it was just word of mouth. Like there was a tower seven and it fell, but no one got it on video, then it would be, you know, it'd be like, you know, you'd have to really look into it and, and really take the word of all these witnesses. But we have five camera angles.

Speaker 2:          02:30:39       We got a good and a professional professionals are saying it was a controlled demo. I mean anybody can tell it's a controlled, it certainly looks like a controlled demo and it does literally fall freeze. Paul speeds. But what's crazy was what, what is inside. Like what, who had there was CIA offices, uh, Enron. All Enron shit was in there. Um, uh, secret service, naval intelligence to me, my guess is that's where everything was orchestrated. That was where to fucking imagine. That was where it was orchestrated it and they go below that motherfucker up. No evidence. Can you imagine? Cause he had to be orchestrated somewhere, somewhere. Had someone had to orchestrate that shit. It looks like it had to be tower southern because why would they completely destroy it? Explosions going off everywhere. There's all these witnesses, there's tons of them. Same bombs are going off everywhere.

Speaker 2:          02:31:33       There's a dude who committed suicide and, but before he committed suicide, he was, he was talking about how he put a bomb, went off in the elevator and he dragged the guy out. It's a famous interview like right there, right when it happened. And he's talking about how I just dragged him out, man. His face was peeling all he had no skinny, just a bomb. Just went off. Just blew up the whole elevator man. And this was right when it happened. Why would it be bullshit? He's talking about it. It is also possible that something could have blown up inside because of the fire. Just just to say, I mean, just as a random, but here's what's crazy, man. The Larry Silverstein, the guy who owned building seven or building towers, all of them, all of them, he, um, he won an $861 million award from industrial risk insurers to rebuild on the side of world tower seven, because, uh, his, uh, estimated investment was only 386 million.

Speaker 2:          02:32:21       So he net a profit of roughly $500 million just on that tower. Just on that, the third tower that no one talks about the third tower that no one talks about, it's not an official government dot, uh, Nylon Commission report. They left it out. And even, even those documentaries, they try to debunk all the nine one one shit. They try to debunk everything that, uh, that, uh, [inaudible], that's what they call them, that, uh, bring up, but they won't touch tower seven. They'll have an, it was an hour and anything on national geographic, any of those documentaries. I firmly believe the CIA has their hand in those documentaries. We know that the CIO has always been involved in Hollywood and always be that involved in TV. Look up Harry Anslinger, the dude who made weedy legal in 1937 he was in, he was the first drugs are, he was involved after all the drug stuff that, that he did.

Speaker 2:          02:33:16       He got involved in governing and supervising Hollywood to make sure there weren't any communists in Hollywood or any pro communist movies. This is all documented there. CIA had control of Hollywood and you know, they have their, their power in there and I believe this is like every documentary on that and the National Geographic Channel that goes over a nine one one or any kind of conspiracy theory. The narrators are just, they're just making fun of conspiracy theories there. And conspiracy theorists, they think this, I'm like, what kind of show is it's so it's so biased and they never cover Tyler seven and these shows, there's a nine one, one debunking documentary on National Geographic that uh, they don't cover tower seven. They'd cover everything else, but except tower seven because they don't have an answer for that. They can't prove that shit cause they can't prove it felt, uh, they can't convince anybody.

Speaker 2:          02:34:13       That 47 story skyscrapers, steels, scriber, will employ all at once. All the columns blow on it once from fire, check out what was there. Here's a, here's some of the buildings. Tenants ready? Yeah. US Secret Service. Yes. The NSA, the CIA, the IRS, the Bureau of Alcohol, alcohol, Tobacco and firearms. The SEC and AI see securities Salomon, Smith, Barney, Solomon Smith, Barney, American Express Bank, International Standard Charter Bank, provident financial manager. It's all like these fucking big giant banks and government all together. Just a fucking cunt farm. The stability of honey, hive of cunts destroy the evidence. That's incredible. Right? Could you imagine how this turns out? That's really what happened. And then check this out of it. It was a controlled demo, so it must have taken weeks to set up. So they must like, you got to investigate the security. Who's running security or guess who's the head of security and Tyler seven Marv Bush.

Speaker 2:          02:35:14       George Bush, his brother. Come on. Yes, dude. Google that. Marv Bush security. Yes. Yes. His brother is in charge of security at Tower Saben. Hilarious is that it's pretty cool. That doesn't fucking make your bullshit meter. Just fucking go off the Richter, but come on how it does, but it all seems so, it's like how do you get, how do you pass a lie? How do you get people to believe a lie and make it so big they can't not believe it. Make it so people always say this, how good. You know how many people who would take to orchestrate done there would never be able to get away with it. Yeah. Yes they do because they control the media yet. How about, and this is on youtube too. There's on youtube, they're reporting. The BBC is reporting. The tower. Seven went collapsed and it's still up. Also because they thought it was going to collapse.

Speaker 2:          02:36:04       Apparently there isn't that kind of fishing. It's like, no. You know what that says that says they already had scripted shit ready to go. They already gave him shit. I already gave him shit. Just to play devil's advocate. It also could be to the firemen had said there's some dangerous creaking and noises and they think that this building's going to fall down and it is possible. That's our and shit. I ain't maybe ma'am. I'm not a fucking scientist. I don't really know. I know. I know. I know. As a host of the show you, you want to be, you know, you want to be neutral, you want to be on the fence, but you know God damn well that there's, that's some bullshit that went down when I went to one. If you look into it unbiased with open mind, you look at all the evidence, just decide to look at all the evidence.

Speaker 2:          02:36:42       I feel the holy Shit. I fell about nine one one very similar to the way I feel about that Phillip Corso son saying it's a time machine. Come on Elliot. It's possible a couple. I don't know. I don't know man. I don't know. If I had to gasp. Very smart. If I had to guess, I would always say I sniff out bullshit. Very good. Sniff out bullshit. Way better than I do, dude. How many guys have like, you know, over the years, like dudes and trying to like, uh, go into business with me or you for whatever. You instantly eagle that guy's full of shit and I'm like, what are you talking about? Your [inaudible], that guy's full of shit. Your bullshit meter is strong, dude. You got one of those high tech alien fucking bullshit meters from the finish. I got a a survival genetic, your bullshit meter is going off on the inside on the novel, the nine one one I would see the problem with that is that's not where I'm, where my bullshit meter works best.

Speaker 2:          02:37:32       My Bill Bullshit, my bullshit meter other works best with people. I need to talk to people. If I talk to people, I could see he was full of shit. Yeah, I could see who's, who's hiding something. There's a tick and insecure aspect to weigh their, the way they're interacting. It's not just modesty or social weirdness. I can see deception. I can see when someone's full of Shit. I'm pretty good at that. But this, see, I don't like fucking with my own head. So whenever I look at something like this, I have to factor in all these different things. I have to factor in possible incompetence, the the need and desire to think that everything's a conspiracy to the point where, like I said, people have compete convinced, you know, other people that I am, some sort of a government agent. I've actually read that, you know, it's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          02:38:14       It's fucking absolutely completely ridiculous. But someone will look for a conspiracy and everything. That would be grounds to be, come on. That would be brilliant. And you think about it when they're like, uh, if you were part of the elite, there's a lot of smart mother fuckers, I'm sure they're brilliant people. Part of the elite if you were in charge of coming up with ways to keep the power and to take liberties away and to take the power from the people, like really? I bet. I'm just guessing. The people at the top, there are people at the time, I bet they're really concerned with keeping their power and however they keep, they don't want to lose their power. Nobody wants to lose their power. They want to keep, so whatever they gotta do to keep their power, it's just the human condition. Anybody that was at the top, that'd be a lot of motherfuckers, just regular people.

Speaker 2:          02:39:00       You put them at the top and they'd be like, maybe we should fucking, how do we call them down? Are you sure that'll work? Okay, let's spray the fuckers with chem trails. Okay, let's do that shit. That's a good idea. That's a really, I'd be a, in the Illuminati boardroom going, yeah, let's spray. Motherfuckers don't ever see a come and they think it's his fucking cloud. Just keep making the lines. No one believes that shit. You know what I mean? Yeah. But we've been caught before and there's been a treaty, a UN treaty in 1977 that we can't spray the people no more. We can't test airborne bacteria on the people no more. We have to stop. Fuck it. Let's just keep doing it. You know what I mean? And now first it's just, uh, uh, first it's just, just regular contracts now. Like all the GL engineering shit's coming on now.

Speaker 2:          02:39:40       It's like there's a guy, there's a guy in a documentary saying that's just con trails. It's not barium and aluminum. But in the future we are going to have to spray barium in aluminum because that's going to be the only way to combat global warming in the future. We're going to have to do, but that's not it right now. Like, dude, what the fuck? They're slowly preppiness for geoengineering protecting the planet. You know what I mean? There's no way. There's the military jets flying all over the world making grids right above us and there's no way they're doing a right above us. And then I, you can convince the chem trails are chemicals and then it's not just a reaction between the moisture in the atmosphere and the turbines and the jet engines that those are contracts. Con trails disappear within 2030 seconds. Are you sure about this stuff?

Speaker 2:          02:40:27       You really do know. How was it possible that they can just get away with this? They can do, they got away with nine one one they could do anything they want. Yeah, but I mean this is what a regular daily thing, right as we were saying over the country and no one talking all over the world except Japan because they're not part of NATO. So they don't do it. There's no camera. Did I get pictures from all over the world? People, you'll see me retweet that shit. People, people who are and and remember guys, you want me to retweet some camp trails? It can't be just one line dude, seven seven send me some alarming shit. People. I retweet a picture of one line. People aren't going to believe that's going to scare people away. So anyways, what I'm saying is, is that for instance, there's a military base in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Cuba, supposedly our enemies, they hate us, we hate them, whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:41:14       But there's a military base on that ion of, of, of Cuba called Guantanamo Bay and Americans is do whatever the fuck they want. They, they, they uh, uh, uh, their ships come in and out. No what the Cubans don't want to fuck with them. They want to start a war with these mother fuckers. Well Jack them and every day. Now this is not a conspiracy theory. This is on a documentary with one of the guys in charge, a military officer, talkies, so against Cuba talking about and bragging about how every day they dive bomb like fighter jets down into downtown Havana. They dive bomb low and just scare him everyday. And he says this on camera and all proud, like all about waving the flag. I'll practice. We do that every day because when we decide to attack them they'll never see it coming. So that's, that's an example of classic military operation like operator operation Northwoods.

Speaker 2:          02:42:05       There they have a pattern. They do sheet over. So to me up and we, and we have, we have, um, ex military, uh, uh, air force and marine people like getting into whether, uh, getting on the news, reporting the weather. There's two separate guys that are on TV and anytime they look at chem trails they'll talk about, well those aren't real clouds. I don't know what the military is doing up there, but they're spraying a thing called chaff. Chaff is aluminum, Barium and it's to get a radar of the whole area. So that's proven. Whoa, wait a minute, it's called chat. They're spraying something in the air so they can get radar. Yes. Because of metallic particles, heart elect. So if you just spray a whole area with, and this is what they do in the military. This is not a conspiracy. That's how they do it.

Speaker 2:          02:42:57       In the military they spray aluminum and Barium to get a radar map and to jam radars, they jam radars and to map out locations as well. Um, how many map manpower locations, like you could detect the Matarin were all the metallic particles land, you know what I mean? So they do that already. They've been doing that since the fourth. They do clouds seat and how do you clouds, if you put barium in disguise and all these tests of all these people are going there, they're spraying, all the tests are coming back with high levels of aluminum, high levels of Barium. And then the myth that's, it's just so happens with the military sprays, it's called, they call it chaff in the military. It's called chaff. And guess what? There's fucking, I don't know why they're doing it, but they're spraying chaff over a lot of major cities in the United States and all over the world.

Speaker 2:          02:43:44       All over England. They're spraying and shop. And it can be two things. If I was running the elite and I said, you know what, spray even make it benign just to throw them up, just spray, put something in in, in the, the, the, the, the atmosphere get, I'm used to all these weird lines. Don't put any aluminum, don't put any barium. Cause once they start testing it, they're gonna, you know, they'll find out that it's totally benign, but just get them used to it. That's what I would do. I would just get the people used to it so that when it's time, you know, if it gets crazy and a revolution comes, dude, all we gotta do is just keep doing what we're doing. They'll never see it coming. People will start dying, aren't they? No. One near to though. Who knows where they're at and I believe this is what I believe.

Speaker 2:          02:44:24       I believe that the pilots don't really even know what the fuck they're doing. I believe they think they're trying to, they're they're, they're claiming that it's for global warming and it's to protect the atmosphere. Now that we're at the stage now where we're at the stage now, where they're admitting that that's what they're going to have to do. We haven't been doing it. Who's admitted to do, there's so much shit on the government to go, go on my youtube channel, go on my youtube channel and gone the playlists chem trails. I got mad dude. The guy that, you know, what's the difference between Google and Youtube? It's all error. You know? It's true. It's visual shit. You make it. You have to, you kind of have, people are talking on video, you make the decision or they've brought a shit. You look at them and then you look at the evidence, the video evidence.

Speaker 2:          02:45:04       You know most people thought Oj was guilty and they didn't. There was no pictures of her. That was, there was no video. Do you know Joey Diaz calls you chem trails sometimes. Exactly. How's chem trails doing? Dude? You know what? I think chem trails. I think anonymous should be trying to get to the bottom of why the military is spraying aluminum and Barium. It fucks our body of looking to, it fucks up our immune system. It fucks up our respiratory system. I think if there is, if there's no barium or aluminum and they're just, I think they're just getting us used to it because when shit goes down the good, the way, the good look at the way she going now they're taking away all our liberty. Liberty's look at all the shit that, the way they're reacting and battling occupy Wall Street and all that shit.

Speaker 2:          02:45:47       They're making it illegal to protest in front of this and that. The way that shit's going. It looks like they're trying to control the revolution. What better way to control the revolution to just spray these motherfuckers? That's the best way. What do you got? Another way? Show me another west the best way. Get them used to the lines and then when it went, if they get too crazy, we'll just spray out. There'll be so easy to calm them down. We could put anything in those clouds and it's in the water. It's in the air, dude. It's brilliant what they're doing. Do you know that there's photos of, uh, of chem trails or what? You know what looks like chem trails? The same thing from like the 1940s apps. They've been doing it, do it. They've been testing it on, on, they've been doing in the military sense from the forties to the 60s and on over 300 cities.

Speaker 2:          02:46:31       Dude, that's why in 1977 that have put a halt to it. They had to put a halt to it. It was ridiculous. They were doing it for over 20 years straight the and in, in the military. That's classic shit. How do you battle? How would you fuck up the enemy spray shit all over him did using chemical weapons. That's old school. They've been doing that shit forever. They didn't have Vietnam with Agent Orange. They've been doing it in the Middle East. They've been doing a world war one World War II. Just spray motherfuckers. That's the chemical warfare. That's the easiest shit. Just fuck them up with the, you don't have to drop bombs on him. You don't have to destroy the buildings or anything. Just spray whatever you want. Something that's going to debilitate them slowly. I mean for people to think that it's impossible. It already happened and they had a stop in in 1977 as a, that kind of obsessed with dude.

Speaker 2:          02:47:16       It's, I see it every God damn day. You're absolutely convinced. I'm absolutely did. I don't put anything past. I don't put anything past the government. I believe there's some shady shit going on. Those aren't commissioner commercial airlines. How do you even coming out of their commercial airline? Cause I pay attention dude. I've been on the, I've been on between Burbank and and lax. I've been on like 10,000 flights. I know the flight patterns. I could look up in the sky and know if that's a commercial airline or have it to a jet commercial airlines. I like straight up like rockets and then come across and they're not, you've got to, if you pay attention like you know birdwatchers right? Like how do you know, how do they keep this shit quiet? They do anything they want. This is above this is they'll do anything they want did, you can't stop them think this is just practice.

Speaker 2:          02:48:02       It could be practice or that we can be right in the middle of it. How much time during the day do you think about this shit? Every time I drive and I fucking see the sky ruined. But what if it wasn't that? What if it really would try? Dude, I hope I'm wrong about chem trails do cause there's a lot of websites to debunk it. Well not just one or two but there's a lot of like scientific science that really deep well they're, they're just like, there's a lot of websites that debunked nine one one. All I know is military jets are making fucking clouds and who knows the exact reason, but we have evidence of military people on a news and weather reports talking about chat. They're reporting on the chaff and they're spraying aluminum and Barium in the s fund. But I mean to say that all of that is what you're seeing.

Speaker 2:          02:48:47       And then some, sometimes you know, they may have done tests in the past, but what you're seeing when you see this criss crossing clouds, I mean if you talk to a a pilot, they explain it in that it's just something when atmospheric would water in the atmosphere encounters the jet engines and it creates these, it's a contrail depending on how much water in the atmosphere can actually create clouds that the numbers that they give out, they have like uh, the temperatures like give me the temperature of what it needs to be. It needs to be like 30,000 feet in the air. Like the humidity and the temperature, they can't, like what's the difference between contrast and Kendra? They can't give you the difference. What's the difference they have come from, from commercial Aircrafts? Do you think they're doing this as a contrast? The ones from commercial airlines are contract, but they look the same.

Speaker 2:          02:49:34       The same. Sometimes there's photos of him. Let's show like commercial Aircrafts and there it looks like or chem trails. No, no, but, but if you pay attention and you look at it, you'll see that it disappears. It won't last forever. There's a big difference between, uh, the ones that lasts the whole day and one's a disappear within 30 seconds. The ones that disappear are totally not a natural phenomenon. It's the jet engine with the heat, with the ice crystals, but it's different. We already know the military sprays aluminum and Barium and we know that when they do that it, it leaves shit on the weather report. They have to explain what it is because of the aluminum, because of the Barium, the weatherman has to explain that that's just military aluminum and Barium. They're explaining that it's already done. It's not like whether or not they do, I mean they definitely know how to make shit rain.

Speaker 2:          02:50:20       There've been doing it in Abu Dhabi. They make it ran once a week and they put, they put chemicals in the sky. Yeah. It's called cloud seeding clouds sitting up. I'm sure there's Barium or it's, it's either burying them or something. Yeah, that's what they're spraying. And that's what they do with chaff. It, they do it. You know, it's this harp. What the fuck is harp? You don't know what harvest. I don't know exactly. I know it scared Jesse Ventura says it's bad, dude. It's, it's, it's one of those things where you all I know about harp, all I know about harp is, um, look into it, man. It's, it's, it used to be, it used to be, uh, a scientific project shooting something in the atmosphere. It's like a billion. It's like a football field filled with all these electrical coils that make like a billion.

Speaker 2:          02:51:05       And they can direct a billion watts into the atmosphere. They're experimenting with the ionosphere or whatever the fuck that means. They're shooting electricity into the atmosphere and experimenting, which it, some people think they're experimenting with whether control and, and uh, um, you, you love conspiracy though. No. But now, now, now, now it got taken out. It's not a scientific project now it's top secret and it's now it's all air force, military, a top secret. They won't tell anybody what it is. It does exist. Punch in harp. It's not a concern. No, no noise. It's real. But what they're doing as a conspiracy. Yeah. Who knows? Uh, it's, it's fascinating. It's fascinating. But you fucking love this shit, dude. I hope. I hope I'm wrong, Dude. I hope I'm wrong, but Julie, I know you do you want to have your, to me, if someone proved it to me that I was wrong, Dude, and I would admit it and I would love it and I would feel great, I'd be like, fuck, I don't have to, when you read the, the sites, the debunk chem trails, you just don't find their arguments.

Speaker 2:          02:52:09       In fact, no, no. It's the same people that think that at nine one one collapse, do fired at the same people, that same mentality they refuse. It's like a game to them. They just want to be right. You look at all the evidence. We already have evidence. We have it's military chaff. We already know that. They're already talking about Geo engineering. They were talking about it in 1996 that they were going to have to suspend metallic particles in the air. As Zachariah Sitchin was talking about this in the 70s that that was going to happen. I was, you know, he said that's how the Annunaki, that's how they, that's how they protected their atmosphere by so south to get high and talk about the Annunaki. I mean, I don't know if the unlucky he was real or not, but God damn, would it be fun if they were real, but it would so suck if they were real.

Speaker 2:          02:52:53       If we, if it turned out that we weren't the apex of the biological life in the universe, if we're not at the top of the heap, we're fucked man. Cause someone's going to treat us the way we treat everything else. You know? So if the Annunaki are real, you should really hope they're not real. We should hope that we become the Annunaki should hope that the film, of course, our junior version as the best version, the fact that there's a time machine and we're going to become that in the future. That seems to me to make more sense. There's probably, who knows man, any when it comes to Ufo every day. Now it's in the science community and astrophysical we're finding there's, you get all these, all this information coming out that there, there's all of these new earth's that they're, they're predicting they're just earth everywhere and there's life teeming in our galaxy.

Speaker 2:          02:53:39       Everyone, like there's on the daily, they're finding evidence like holy shit, there's probably a billion fucking earths in our galaxy or some shit they're putting out is pretty crazy. When you think about the possibilities, possibilities are endless. They're really can have life seeds from other planets getting hit by asteroids and it's all a natural part of the process. Think about this. If there's a million earths in this guy that just say a million, how many of those herbs are ahead of us in technology? I'm sure there's some that are like not as far as we've come, but there's a, you know, just the odds you look at like a scientist, there's a million right, that you would say, let's just say a thousand are way ahead of us. God dammit, that's a thousand a thousand race. There must be a galactic federation there. There must be, I think may comment said to be like a little bit smarter than this.

Speaker 2:          02:54:30       And then we just blow shit up over and over again. I think that's what we do. There was a, you know what, there's a possibility that, uh, out of all the earth and all the, the, the human like careers within the front of the line, like maybe 70% of them don't make it. You know, like in, in the Roman times, it was a 50% mortality rate. When you have a kid, there's a happened, ha ha, there's 50% chance that it's going to die in Roman times. So maybe it's like that. Maybe there's 50% chance that, you know, we get to a point and we just blow ourselves up cause corruption takes over and evil just takes them. And then there's a

Speaker 4:          02:55:04       small percentage, maybe it's like 10% 20% of all of these earth like planets that actually get past that and we all connect and we're living like, you know that when they have like a category one society's, you know, level one society and level two that, you know, I think a Michio Kaku has done this like explaining the different levels of, you know, societies that can get to a point where they get away from physical violence, then they can, you know, use a harness the power of the stars and then space travel and all sorts of different categories and that we're, we're like on the verge of becoming significant. There's, there's, I personally believe just based on just basic odds that there is a galactic federation and maybe we are just, we don't know about it. Maybe the elite know about it and they're communicating with them, but the people we don't want to leave.

Speaker 4:          02:55:55       You know, I think our elite, there are people at the top. They're not all at the bottom. There's people at the top. This is a very real, I think the very real possibility that our number one problem is that we're separated from this idea of how connected we all to each other because psychedelics are illegal. That's why this world in this country that we live in, this government that we're running to is so fucked up and corrupt because they don't deserve to be in the position they're ad they've never had a life changing experience to the point where they have experienced that other side of of possible reality that comes from the psychedelic experience. You can't get past that. It's unbelievably humbling and you should be looking for that in a leader. You shouldn't want a leader that hasn't that psychedelic experiences cause that's a person who hasn't really faced whatever the fuck that is.

Speaker 4:          02:56:38       When you strip away culture, when you strip away language and you just see truth and love in this humbling Bayer form, they'd just like rips you to your core and makes you sorta rebuild and restructure who you are as a human being. A lot of those motherfuckers have never had that man. There's a lot of people that are out there running around, flapping their gums that have never really been humbled by life. They never be really been humbled by a psychedelic experience, which is a part of life. It's not just a choice. I think it's a part of life. It certainly is a choice. I mean don't get me wrong, don't do it. If you, if you don't do drugs and you can't handle even a drink, you know, don't, don't go, don't do anything you're not comfortable with, but it's a part of life man.

Speaker 4:          02:57:17       That's why it's here. That's why it works on you. The reason why it works, he says cause it's here for to work for you. It's a part of you. You're, you're part of a giant system. Get some mushrooms in your head bitch. Right? Yeah, man, I got to take off. I gotta I gotta end this to this. How long did we go? Almost three hours. Two hours of 57 minutes. How Fun was that? Did we do enough of it? Man, I don't want people passed on and we did a lot of shit. We did a, it was a beautiful thing, man. These conversations are so far. Um, effortless. Yeah. Yeah, it was great. I love doing that. Oh, I'm going to do more of these one on one conversations. I think sometimes it's different, you know, it mixes it up a little bit. We've got a lot of cool a guest this week though.

Speaker 4:          02:57:54       I think we're, I think Chael Sonnen's this week. I'm not sure. I got to call is going to be awesome. When is that? I don't know. Soon Ronda Rousey. We're going to, she's going to be sooner. I ran into her at the UFC looking good is ever going to face for dice Kat. Von D is interested. Is she really? I would love to have her on and just talking about art. She's been on the road and she didn't have like, there's some personal turmoil going on right now, but um, she got, she wants to volunteer. I love her art work, man. I love looking at, shoot, just like a sketch a day. She did. She did down my grandma on my chest. It's beautiful too. It's amazing. All right, that's it folks. We're going to have a death death squad show this weekend at the Ice House in Pasadena on Friday night. It's only 85 seats and they always sell out.
