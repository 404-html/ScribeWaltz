Speaker 1:          00:00:07       The Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       day, Joe Rogan podcast by night.

Speaker 3:          00:00:15       Rhonda, I presume. Good to see you again. Good to see you too. Last time I saw you, I introduced you to the wonderful world of head trauma. Indeed, Dr Rhonda got her first experience of a live UFC event and just to preface it, you really didn't know much about the UFC at all before you went to this thing with your husband and it was. Well, I'll put you. You were pretty shocked.

Speaker 1:          00:00:42       Yes. I mean to be honest, I had no clue until the morning of or the day before and that was like the morning of the day before it's blank that I looked it up and it was like I saw people were like in a cage fighting and I was like, holy crap. I thought it was, you know, totally. I don't know even know what I was expecting. It was just some kind of wrestling thing or something, you know? I think I was confusing it with the w. w e e is that what? Wrestling the ww something wrestling. So Ufc, I mean just these little three letter acronyms, acronyms. So you had really never been exposed to any sort of mixed martial arts. That's so funny. Not Mixed martial arts. I mean I was, you know, aware of things like taekwondo and all that, but I just know that they exist and that they're kind of cool.

Speaker 1:          00:01:33       And that's, that's about it. Had you ever been to a boxing match before? No, I had never been to a boxing match and I've really never really watched when I've seen probably clips or pieces of it, like throughout my life at some point, but I'm just no exposure in general. I don't have a sports gene in my body while I love to like work out and exercise and you know, I'm very addicted to the brain benefits and other benefits I have never really like watched sports or been interested in it like in general. And I try really hard because my dad is a huge sports fan. Oh love. He plays baseball. I mean he's 65 and he still plays baseball on like a men's league. So anyone watches football, basketball, any sport, any like manly sport, you know, he, he watches, he knows everything about.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       And he's not a big science guy, so I try really hard to bond with him when I'm with him. I'm like trying really hard to be interested or like he'll take me to a padres game, you know, in San Diego and I'm like, I try to like understand, you know, the, like what's happening. But it takes a little work for me. Um, with that said, that whole, that mma experience was very unique because I've been to a baseball game. I've been to a football game, basketball game. So those are the sports that I've actually spectated live at some point in my life. But the MMA was a very different experience. Um, I've, it felt very like there was kind of a tribal component to it where you've got people cheering when the fighters are coming down the aisle and I don't know the way the music, like drums and stuff, we're going, I something beating and then this, the whole people fighting in a cage made me feel like this, you know, times back in the Roman colosseum where they'd go and watch people fight.

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       And there's a lot of that in it. You know, there's definitely a lot of tribal, the tribal element of the music. Yes. Different people from different cultures have different music, like a lot of the country music guys or country guys will come out to like country songs and guys who were like a more urban will come out to the rap songs. A lot of white guys come up with a rap songs too, but, you know, some guys would come out to like classic rock and everyone's like, Yay, I love that song. I'm going to root for this dude. You know, but it's uh, there's definitely an element of that in it. The music was cool and that, that I think that also gave that tribal feeling, but then the cheering and how people were like, I had it just, there is something moving inside of me that I was not expecting.

Speaker 1:          00:04:12       And then so it was cool. And in that regard where it was like, oh, this feels like some unique experience that I wouldn't get at. You know, they haven't ever experienced any sort of other sport event that I've attended. So when you said something was moving inside of you, you mean like you were emotionally moved, like you got excited, your heart raced. It was part of the community that you know, was like, wow, this is some kind of community that I get to experience for a day. Yeah, it was, it was some sort of unique event where I felt like I was just, you know, connecting with these people that are around me. It's a very addictive community too. I can imagine. It was a lot of fun. You know, it was a lot of fun. Aside from the me, you know, looking at the effects on the brain and stuff a lot of these fighters are experiencing.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       Aside from that, it was, it was a lot of fun. I really, really liked it. That was the thing. We all went out afterwards. A giant group of US afterwards went out to eat and you just were wide eyed. You had like, like saucer eyes and you were like the amount of damage that you just couldn't. I couldn't stop calculating the amount of damage that was going on to these people's brains. Irreversible damage. Like yes, well that and coupled with our conversation the night before where, you know, denny was talking about friends that were fighters that, you know, having memory problems and immediately when he started describing some of those characteristics, I was like, that sounds just like an Alzheimer's patient and just because I wasn't really aware of any of the MMA, you know, community, what it involves, what sort of, you know, it seems like there's a lot of, you know, there's not a lot of rules.

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       Like you know, you can, you can punch someone in the head and you can kick, you can choke, you can, you know, boxing, I don't think they can kick. And so it seems like there was a lot of other stuff going on that was very traumatic. It's so funny. Listen to you describe it because you're, you're so educated in science and the human body and the effects of vitamins and various nutrients in the human body. So to see you get your first exposure to what's like a normal part of my life. It's like a daily part of my life essentially is being exposed to this stuff. So it's, it's fascinating to watch you, like, I don't think they can kick in boxing. You're so removed now. It's like you're an alien from another planet and landed in the world of MMA for a day. Yes. That, that, that is kind of how I felt.

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       Wow. But I'm right. Right. You're right, you're right. You're right. Well, there is a thing called kickboxing A. There's a company called glory and they hold these events on Spike TV, which is a American cable channel and they're allowed to kick that kick and they can need, they can't elbow though. Um, it's like a modified version of what's called [inaudible] Thai and Moitai is Thai boxing and in Thailand, um, they are the experts in this very particular type of kickboxing where they do a lot of clenching. They grab a hold of each other and need each other in the body and the head and the elbow from the clench and they, they throw a lot of leg kicks. They're known for their, they're kicking ability. I've seen Muy Thai, like on twitter and like, you know, tweeting at me and stuff. But I really didn't know exactly what it was and monetize pretty wild.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       Actually. I didn't even realize people used kickbox. I thought kickboxing was like a way to work out. Like I didn't realize there was actually people fighting seriously. Like I really, really thought that it was just a way to work out until just now, wow, that's so crazy. I'm in another world. I do a lot of. I was telling my husband the other day, like, you know, people on weekends, they go out and they think they go camping and they hike and they go and they go to the woods and a fight, you know, see all these new things in the forest, which I love to do by the way. But every day what I did was I'm like hiking and foraging through the human body. And it's like everyday I'm doing this constantly and I do get a little, um, you know, I'm, I'm sort of sheltered from a lot of other things because I'm just like, oh, he's reading about science and health and mechanisms. And so at times I am with other things that are so common knowledge to people. I'll kind of like blow people's minds around like no, I didn't know. Like what other things are you completely cultural norms that you're completely unaware of? Well, a lot of sports things, definitely at television stuff. Um, you know, just any of that television world

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       and people always relate to commercials and like I nothing, it's like yours without a TV's

Speaker 3:          00:09:05       CV and I still don't relate to. Someone just explained to me that the show bones on Fox has been on for like six years or something like that was on the other day in a hospital waiting room. I was watching it and I was like, what this show is, how long it's been on and like spend on forever. I was like, what? Come on, like there's so many shows. I have no idea what they are. I'll pass by US weekly. And with someone on the cover, you know, she's leaving him. She started like, who the fuck is she? Who's he? Who apparently they're huge celebrities. I have no idea who they are.

Speaker 4:          00:09:38       Yeah, that's, that's. So I'm, I'm in that sort of a mindset mindset, so, um, but you know, back to the, to the UFC event, um, yes. So the watching the event was really exciting, but I'm starting to look at, you know, these blows that people were taken to their head and the choking, there seems to be a lot of choking going on and you know, some of those sort of. I was just from what little I knew at the time it was already like, wow, this seems like, you know, some stuff's going down. Basically smoking

Speaker 3:          00:10:15       though is not as dangerous as the, the, the issue with choking is annie grappling. You're gonna develop microtrauma, you're gonna have disc issues. As you get older you're going to have the just a lot, a lot going on with the spine, you know, and so there's some trauma, but for the most part the choking is not too dangerous. There's one repeated issue that's been happening a lot lately. Never happened in the UFC, but it's been happening in smaller organizations and it's a very particular move where someone will go for a take down, which is to the guy there standing up. You try to take the guy down and then the person who they're trying to take down gets the guy in what's called a guillotine choke and a good team choke is your head is trapped under the armpit and you have your forum or anything neck and you're pulling up on the neck and then the person who's caught in the good team tries to take the person down by like picking them up and trying to throw them and they land on the guys head and that people are becoming paralyzed from it.

Speaker 3:          00:11:19       It's happened several times. It's happened in training a couple of times and tapping a couple times in fights, but it's enough of an issue where it's starting to scare the shit out of me. You know that guys who get caught and good teams try to slam their way out of it. They try to pick a guy up and slammed their way out of it instead of trying to be technical and grab a hold of the hand and try to work your way out of it. It's just [inaudible] that choke is so sudden when you get caught in it, it's such a nasty joke that the, the, there's like one or two seconds where you had with a guy who's really good, where you have to breathe,

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       where you know, otherwise you're, you're, you're pretty much going to go unconscious. So that's one thing I was wondering with the choking specifically was, you know, because choking, you know, you can to some degree cause some hypoxia in the brain so you know, you're not causing ischemic damage, which is like no oxygen getting into the brain, but you may have reduced oxygen in the body compensates for that. They know the body will because it senses that less oxygen is getting the brain. It increases blood flow as a compensation. But if that can't, if it can't compensate what happens, you know, you'll start to, um, eventually like your motor control will get affected. And I was wondering if they use that as a technique like because then that the, because they're choking their opponent, now their opponents, motor control gets effected. No goals, just put the guy of sleep, which is even worse because that's the next step, which then you become the top.

Speaker 4:          00:12:50       Yeah. So, and there is that, that hypoxic damage, you know, there is damage occurring, what kind of damage has occurred and when the going gets choked out, completely asleep, completely asleep. So you're talking about, you know, not enough oxygen getting the brain for just a couple of seconds, a few seconds. I'm one of the thing that can happen is that you can have a lactate buildup. So, um, the, so your brain, so you have a neurons and you have supporting cells in your brain called astrocytes and glial cells. But astrocytes are a specific type of. Glial cells are really important. They do a lot of things for the brain and they make up like 50 percent of the human brain volume. They actually, um, they use glucose and they use glucose in a way where they don't need their mitochondria. So they use glucose through something called glycolysis and the byproduct is they make lactate.

Speaker 4:          00:13:46       And the reason they do this is because the lactate then goes into the neuron and it goes right into the Mitochondria and is used to produce energy, but that isn't needs to be coupled to oxygen. So lactate is, um, a really great source of energy for neurons because it's, it's not for the Neuron to convert glucose into Piru, um, which then gets used as energy costs energy, but for lactate to get converted into Piru Bait to then be used as energy, it's thermodynamic dynamically favorable because it doesn't cost any energy to do that. So, um, but this requires oxygen. This is this oxidative phosphorylation mechanism that I've talked about before. Um, but when you don't have oxygen there, then the lactate can't be used by the neurons. And uh, so lactate will then build up and can, cause, you know, it can cause cell death when you have too much lactic acidosis building up in their brain.

Speaker 4:          00:14:45       Now that I don't, you know, with the amount of choking, I don't think that's much of an issue because this is more for like a real, like real trauma, like intense trauma, more like a head trauma blow to the head or um, you know, even like the rapid acceleration and deceleration that occurs like car accidents mostly. Yeah. I don't think that, you know, the blows to the head, you know, people's heads are moving, but it's not as, it's not like a car hitting you where it's like really, really rapid acceleration deceleration. That's a real problem. Um, so I think, you know, once I started to dive into this, I start to read about traumatic brain injury. Um, and specifically I became interested in that, in it because of the Alzheimer's connection and was like, Whoa, wait a minute. Why are these young people coming down with symptoms of Alzheimer's?

Speaker 4:          00:15:34       Like in like early, early age like that, there's, there's some, some connection between the way the normal brain ages and something that's happening with traumatic brain injury. So I became really interested in, started reading about it, you know, since I went to that a UFC event and I'm really a fascinating, you know, I've been reading a lot about it and you know, these, these fighters, fighters, nfl players, you know, people, boxer boxing, anyone that's taking blows to the head, you know, whatever sport, you know, that that's some, you know, in some regard, I think even rugby, things like that. Um, you know, these, these people have a uh, increased incident of Alzheimer's in some cases just, you know, two to three fold increased case if Alzheimer's. Um, and, and it's an earlier onset, you know, and it's very like indistinguishable, indistinguishable in terms of like some of the pathology that occurs in their brain compared to like someone who's, you know, 75, 80, 85 years old and getting Alzheimer's.

Speaker 4:          00:16:36       So, um, I started reading about this like, what's going on? Um, and what happens is like even just a single blow to the head, um, can cause, you know, it can increase the risk for Alzheimer's and when you're having multiple repetitive injuries that's, you know, increases the risk even more. Um, and so initially like there's a lot of changes that happened, but when you have a blow to the head, you know, you've got the acute damage that happens. So, you know, um, tissue damage you can get, like diffuse axonal injury, things like that. And that's from like a real trauma to the head. But you know, even just like re mild repetitive trauma is what happens is you get tissue damage and you release a lot of reactive oxygen species, which I've talked about before which are released every, every day. We're releasing that in our brains and our other cells through just normal metabolism.

Speaker 4:          00:17:28       Um, it's kind of like a byproduct of normal metabolism. So people that are not getting brain injury, it's happening in a little bit each day. But with a brain injury, when you're, when you're getting a blow to the head, it induces a massive, massive amount of release of it and it starts to damage the manichees. So which, which, uh, form of protective membrane, the brain and those cells start to die. A reactive oxygen species as a protective mechanism. It causes cells to die. And the reason it does, I've talked about reactive oxygen species before in the context of cancer. When you get a little bit of reactive oxygen species such as like normal metabolism you can do, you can cause damage to DNA. And when you damage the DNA, you can either repair that damage. If you don't, you can get a mutation eventually that builds up and leads to cancer.

Speaker 4:          00:18:17       But if you have a huge burst of it, like in the case where you're getting an injury, then you're talking about a protective mechanism that kicks in, which is like, okay, I need to kill the cell and the reasoning to kill cells because I don't want to get all that damage that's going to cause me cancer. So it's. So it's a protective mechanism. So it's killing cells to protect itself. Yes, that's, that's the, uh, biological mechanism as to why this huge burst of reactive oxygen species does kill cells. It's a, you know, it's a conserved and evolutionary conserved mechanism and it really is important, like if you're, if you stand, that's why part of the, you know, underlying mechanism for radiation in terms of like treating cancer radiation is, you know, you're, you're, you're causing double stranded breaks in DNA. It's just like you're, you know, you're, you're damaging the DNA and it's a huge amount of damage.

Speaker 4:          00:19:08       So it causes cells to die. Um, so this is happening in the brain and it's really not a good thing because in the sense for this, you know, on the acute injury, you've got these energy cells that start to die and then astrocytes, which like, you know, they are part of them like help form some of the blood brain barrier. They start to die and when those astrocytes start dying, that form the blood brain barrier, what happens is the blood brain barrier gets leaky. And now you have things like, um, you know, potassium chloride, sodium leaking into the brain and causing astrocytes to swell, causing water to flow in and you get, you know, a Dema and the brain, like I looked at this guy mark comic, I think if you could go and you can see like a picture of his swollen Dema like head and it's just like unbelievable.

Speaker 4:          00:19:57       So that's part of the, the cause of this edema. So you've now what happens is that reactive oxygen species, those dead cells, the blood brain barrier gets compromised immediately when that happens, these immune system and the brain gets activated. So you have another part of glial cells called Microglia, which are like the immune cells in the brain. They get activated when the blood brain barrier gets damaged and they migrate up and they're trying to plug up the hole. So they're like, oh my God, you know, the blood brain barrier has been compromised. So they might get up and start trying to plug up the hole. The problem is now you've activated, activated this whole immune response where it starts to. Cause. Yeah, look at that. I mean, that's just so awful when you see a lump like that fight should be stopped immediately.

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       Yeah. I would say was, did he keep fighting after that fall, another round and one won the final round with a, with a big injury like that. That's just unbelievable honestly. Um, so in your opinion as a medical professional, when you see that kind of swelling, um, this is, this is not a guy who should be hitting the head again. And I would, I would say definitely not. There's a lot of consequences that can occur when you're sick, when you already have this type of damage where your immune system has been activated. I mean, you're getting. So that's not just A. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but that's not just a wound that's bleeding under the skin. That's part of the thing that's happening. But in addition to that, you're, you've got all sorts of cellular changes that are occurring. You're getting, you know, like I said, damage to the damage.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       These astrocytes that are forming the blood brain barrier and then you start getting those, they start dying and when they start dying at dead cell, you know, in addition to the, the Microglia, the immune system in the brain getting activated to try to plug up the damage. It also, as soon as you have cells dying, which in a case like this, when you're. We've got massive damage. It's happening on a huge scale. These microglia, they try to like eat up and get rid of all the cellular debris. I mean that's part of what they do their program to do these. They get activated when you have a bunch of dead cells and they try to go eat away this damage. And the problem is, is that when that starts to happen, you're getting a starting a cycle of neuroinflammation in the brain, which is very bad.

Speaker 1:          00:22:30       And you know, what happens even within like hours of an injury like that is you start to get accumulation of something called amyloid Beta plaques in the brain. So, you know, traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's, they have a lot in common in the sense where, you know, traumatic brain injury is a massive amount of damage and it's happening in one instance or even just mild repetitive injuries. You may not get someone that has a swollen head like mark, but you know, just taking repetitive blows to the head. Also, you're causing your activating, you know, reactive oxygen species are causing cells to die and you are activating the immune system even with a mild injury. And what happens is that, um, you know, in addition to start activating this immune system, then this also causes the accumulation of these amyloid Beta plaques accumulate in the brain. So amyloid Beta plaques is one of the major pathologies associated with Alzheimer's. What happens is as we age, we have a little bit of inflammation going on in our brain. Know we have cells dying. We have, you know, this is, this is a little bit by bit scale every day. And so by the time, you know, seven, eight decades go by, you know, we've accumulated enough damage,

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       stuff starts getting messed up. So amyloid Beta plaques, they form outside of neurons in between glial cells and neurons and what they do. If you can even Google amyloid Beta plaques, you'll see they form these little plaques outside of the neurons and this disrupts like glucose metabolism and neurons and astrocytes. It causes even more reactive oxygen species to be generated. So now you're generating even more and more on a daily basis. And the microglia cells, the immune cells of the brain get activated when there's a plaque just like they do when there's a dead cell. They're like, oh my God, what is this? I need to get rid of it. So they get activated. They secrete proinflammatory cytokines. They're doing all this firing, firing and the trying to eat the plaques and so you know that it causes this vicious cycle of neuroinflammation where then that causes more plugs to be formed.

Speaker 4:          00:24:37       So you have. It's a terrible, terrible cycle of neuroinflammation. This amyloid Beta plaques form in in fighters and also in like NFL player that they've looked at these plaques that are in the brains and they've. They've even shown by like pet scans that they form immediately, like within hours, and this even happens in children that have undergone trauma, you know, so there's something, it's almost like the traumatic brain injury is like accelerated aging, like, like it's just instead of seven decades, boom, it's like it's happening, you know, in an instant, in like in the course of hours, and then you keep it and then it causes this huge cycle of neuroinflammation. So in addition to that, Tau tangles start to form. This is another thing that happens in response to the activation of these microglia cells in the brain. We're now you've got something like inside your neuron, you, you've got a protein called tau and it's really an important protein because basically what it does is it's like it's transporting cargo all like a down the long Axon to the snapchat cleft where neurotransmission occurs, where do you form synopsis to learn memory?

Speaker 4:          00:25:47       Those things are happening. It's taking, it's transporting lipids, it's transporting glucose, it's transporting mitochondria that, you know, need to get to that synaptic cleft to produce energy. Um, so it's like, it's, you know, it's transporting all this cargo to get there to do all this really important stuff for your brain to function. But what happens is, you know, traumatic brain injury and also just normal brain aging when you have this activation of the immune system and reactive oxygen species, it causes this thing aggregate and it screws up its function and now it can't transport any of that cargo. It's like the train became derailed. It can't get there. So now you can't get, you know, nutrients to the, to the part of the neuron where it needs to get. You can't get Mitochondria there, you know, which are making energy. And so you start to have things breaking down.

Speaker 4:          00:26:33       You start to have synopses dying. Um, you know, that's part of the reason. So to neurons, they, when you learn something, you form a synaptic connections between the neurons. And that's the whole purpose of neurons. They, they want to form connections with other neurons. And that's, you know, that's what they're there for. And when you can't do that, if there's not enough energy and it starts breaking down, the neurons have no purpose, they, they can't, so they die. And so this, this causes brain atrophy. And it happens, you know, in normal brain aging over the course of several decades where you can look at an Alzheimer's brain and it's just gotten massive atrophy. Well, the same thing happens with traumatic brain injury. You know, these people are, are losing a lot of cells, glial cells and neurons in their brain and it's causing brain atrophy. So, you know, these, the accumulation of amyloid Beta and tau tangles are two prominent features of Alzheimer's that are disrupting all sorts of, there causing, like I said, Immuno Neuro inflammation.

Speaker 4:          00:27:31       They're causing a reactive oxygen species to be generated and does it. It causes a cycle where it just won't stop because whenever there's an amyloid plaque, you activate more microglia, the Microglia get activated and makes more plaques. You know. So it's, it's just this horrible cycle that doesn't get broken and not something that's, that's really, uh, they found both of these things very prominently in brains of people that have undergone Tbi. I have a question about repeated trauma. So if you are in a fight and you get hit and hurt and you get in trouble, but you survive and then you make it to the next round, do the, the impacts that you take after that, are they even more devastating because of the initial impact? Yes. So what happens is, because of the initial, the initial injury, your cells and because of the, the, the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory response and these things that are happening, that is all a stress to the cell.

Speaker 4:          00:28:33       So the cell is already stressed and when a cell is stressed, it is more susceptible to death. Um, this is, this is kind of part of the mechanism by which cancer cells are primed to die in a sense where cancer cells are stressed because all sorts of stuff is going wrong in them and they are primed to die. Like they, the cell is expressing what's called pro apoptotic proteins in cells that are proteins that are going to make the cell die, but the cancer cells found a way to overcome that by expressing these antiapoptotic proteins, and so it's a good balance between, okay, how much do I have that's gonna make me die or not make me die? So that's happening when you have a stressed cell from injury and then like for example, brain injury, they're also, you know, the, the reactive oxygen species causes those cells to make more of those proteins that are saying, okay, di Di di, so they're already primed to die.

Speaker 4:          00:29:32       Even if they, some of them die immediately, but even the ones that haven't died immediately, they may not be dead because there's enough of those ones that are saying, no, don't die, don't die. Yet. There's enough of that protein there to sort of balance it out. But then when you take another stress boom, it just tips it. It tips it towards death. So stress plus stress is additive in that stress can sensitize you to death. Stress Plus stress will definitely cause death. So that's, that's something that, you know, taking, you know, having repetitive injuries specimen, especially in a short timeframe like that, um, you know, sensitizes them to death. So plus it's also, you know, you're, you're making more of these amyloid Beta plaques in your brain, you know, these, this is like, like I said, it's happening within our. So like the more injury that's happening, the more this is occurring.

Speaker 4:          00:30:20       So it's, it's really a nasty thing and I'm with fighters just from watching the one event that I went to. I mean it was clear that Mo, pretty much all of them were taking injuries to the head. Um, and so something that people may not be aware of. When I say people, I mean people in the mma community is that there's something else that really predisposes these fighters to nerve degenerative diseases. Um, so there's, they categorize them as there's different ones like pugilistic dementia, and then there's chronic traumatic encephalopathy. And these are all, if you look pathologically, they all have, they all share characteristics with Alzheimer's disease. They all have these amyloid Beta plaques that have accumulated in the brain. They have Taupe, protein aggregating, there's, you know, inflammation, massive atrophy happening because these things caused cell death. These are all very common in their shared pathological features and all these neurogenic diseases.

Speaker 4:          00:31:27       I'm not sure what exactly if they see, if they can't call it Alzheimer's because Alzheimer's is an age related disease, so it's like calling someone who's 45 and has massive amyloid plaques in their brain and it's affecting their memory and it's affecting their behavior. Calling that Alzheimer's is kind of weird because Alzheimer's, just a limiting word. Do you think you're winning because when you're dealing with the exact same situation but brought on by trauma? I don't know. I, I. it's hard for me to definitively say that. It's a speculation. I think that looking at, like I said, I think these pugilistic dementia and these chronic traumatic encephalopathy, it's like Alzheimer's, but on an accelerated rate and it happened specifically as a consequence to traumatic injury to the head. I've seen it happen in a fight like I've seen a guy be one way and then have a fight and see noticeably diminished ability to communicate.

Speaker 4:          00:32:26       Yes. Yeah. That's one of the features of lack of oxygen to the brain because now you can't have energy, you know, be energy's not being made to have, you know, to, to facilitate neurotransmission and memory, like learning and things and communication. Like what happens when you have inner injury is that everything gets diverted to repair its energy. You only make so much energy and you know, so it's a constant battle and this is the same for people that are obese type two diabetics, whatever type of chronic injury that's happening in the body, gut inflammation, you know, there's, there's a lot of energy that need that's required to repair that injury. And so it's, it's, it's energy gets diverted to repairing that injury. And what happens when you have all the energy that the cells are making go to repair well, things that are, you know, normal function, don't get it. So your metabolism is kind of screwed up. You're thinking, you know, these things are, it's like a, a triage almost where you're triaging this to the essential like I need to repair this damage. If I don't repair this damage, I might die. So it's like you're shutting the energy to that repair process. So things like short term memory, communication, all that sort of gets screwed up in a way. So that makes perfect sense that, that would happen.

Speaker 3:          00:33:50       Yeah. Because I've literally seen guys in, um, it's, it's, it's so nonscientific to judge them by the standard because, you know, just my perceptions. But I've seen a guy be one way and then have a couple of really brutal fights and then there's a noticeable dimness to the way they look, the way they talk. They just, there seems to be like a, like a loss. What timeframe are we talking about here? A couple months.

Speaker 4:          00:34:18       Yeah. Wow. So, I mean they've, they've been shown that this injury, the acute effects that I was describing in terms of like, you know, the immune system, the immune cells in the brain, the microglia getting aggravated and amyloid Beta plaques forming and all that stuff happens and they showed that this continues to happen for months, even years later, even with just a single, like traumatic brain injury. So

Speaker 3:          00:34:41       one rough fight can potentially effect of a person other than negative impacts. Compounds

Speaker 4:          00:34:47       four years, yes, yes. They have shown a dose dependent effect in terms of even multiple mild traumatic injuries they compound over years and they cause pugilistic dementia. They cause, you know, these types of neurodegenerative diseases that are very, very similar to Alzheimer's. And something that I want to point out that may predispose people to them more is genetics. So this is something that's very, very similar to Alzheimer's as well. There's, there's, so we have different variations of genes and these are called polymorphisms. Really all a polymorphism is it's, it's a gene, but it's like it's, there's a slight variation in the sequence of DNA and that slight variation in the sequence of DNA can change the function of that gene somewhat. Um, I think if we were to really look deeply at polymorphisms, we'd find there's gotta be a selective reason why we've acquired these sort of changes.

Speaker 4:          00:35:54       Like there's gotta be an advantage. The polymorphisms aren't mutations in the sense where like a mutation is random, you know, that just happens. Polymorphisms are selected for and they occur in a, in a decent percent of the population. So you know, there seems to be like you can always find, even if the gene changes the gene in the sense where it seems like it's not doing something as well as it should be doing. If we look hard enough, we might find there's actually a reason why there's sort of like a trade off, right? So anyway, so gene polymorphisms or we've got, you know, these are very common ones. People are always looking at things like the breast cancer related genes like Brca one, Brca two, where it's like, Oh, if you have a certain variation of this gene, you have a dramatic increase in possibly getting breast cancer.

Speaker 4:          00:36:42       Well we've got a lot of different variations in genes and one of them is associated with a dramatic increased risk for Alzheimer's disease. It's an engine called [inaudible] and this, this gene is polymorphic in the sense where there's actually multiple bearing inside, but there's three different isoforms of it that are common in the human population. It's called [inaudible] two [inaudible], three and April before. And essentially what it's a, it's a light bulb protein and it's, it's made in the liver. And also in the brain and the liver, what it, what its main function is. It's actually transporting cholesterol like dietary cholesterol and it's making sure it gets to your cells that need it and bringing it back to the liver to get recycled. So plays a very important role in cholesterol. Transport turns out in the brain, in our astrocytes are astrocytes, make cholesterol. We have, we produce apo e in the brain and it plays a very important role in transporting this cholesterol made from astrocytes to neurons.

Speaker 4:          00:37:46       And it's it, it's doing other things also involved with amyloid Beta. But the point is is that there are, like I said, there are three variations. The main one is apo e three and that's what the majority of population has. So you get one every gene you have, you get one copy from your mom and you get one copy from your dad. So you have two copies of every gene. And so that's when an illegal is. So most people have two copies of April, we three, which is good because it's considered the normal one like but 25 percent of the population has one illegal of April. We four. And so April we four, so 25 percent. That's one in four. People just have the general population has one of these illegals that they either got from their and their dad. People that have to. So they got one from this.

Speaker 4:          00:38:39       It's much more rare. It's like two percent of the population actually have two copies of the apoe e four. So 25 percent of population has one copy of April before. And what happens is April we for increases the risk of Alzheimer's by two to three fold. Okay. So people that have April before have an increased risk of just two to three fold. And this is recognizable in the DNA tests. So you could potentially scan athletes. Yeah. So I'm getting to that. Yeah. So exactly. So people that are fighters that are, or nfl players, people that are any sort of trauma to the brain, if they're getting this, you know, as a part of their sports curriculum or whatever, those people that have won a but we for so traumatic brain injury itself increases the risk of Alzheimer's by two to three fold, just like people that don't have traumatic brain injury but have this April.

Speaker 4:          00:39:30       We for people that have Tbi and April before increase their risk by like tenfold. So having just one Leo, you'd have something, you have a guy who's getting blows to the head and he has an April before he's had taken his risks from two to three fold to tenfold to get. Yes. And we're talking 25 percent of the population has this. So they've shown, they've shown they've done studies and they've shown, you know, traumatic brain injury dramatically increases the risk of neurodegenerative disease. It's also stroke people with a stroke, stroke and have April before you're talking about a tenfold increase risk of having a neurodegenerative disease. So the problem is, is that you're having before is you can't repair damage as well. Uh, you know, when you're, when you have damage that occurs, you know, there's a lot of repair mechanisms that can happen so you can have what's called like if you lose, like the synapses that are formed between the two neurons, amyloid Beta screws that up, but you can repair that damage by having what's called neurite outgrowth.

Speaker 4:          00:40:35       So you grow new projections to that neuron. That's one way to repair the damage and Aicpa we plays a very important role in that because it brings cholesterol and fatty acids to the neuron, the membrane and that, that's really important to be able to grow new synopsis. You need that April before doesn't do that as well. And also not only does April, we've worn out do that as well. There's also bad effects. April we for itself, um, is, it's the polymorphism that happens, it changes the structure of it. And so it's like getting degraded a lot so you don't have enough of a around and it chops it up and starts aggregating and doing bad stuff itself. So it's like, it's just terrible because what happens when you have Tbi, when you have an injury, the brain actually increases a bowie because it's like, oh, I got to repair some damage, but if you have that April week four, it's increasing the bad part.

Speaker 4:          00:41:28       It's increasing, you know, the bad stuff. So you can actually test for this, this variant using 23 and me for example. So I actually recently did a, did a 23 and me test. It's $99 and you spit and like a little tube and you send it off to the, to the 23 and me and they, you know, isolate Dna from your saliva and then they look for very common polymorphisms. So they look for April, we, they look for Parkinson's related ones are in cancer and all that. So, uh, you know, unfortunately the FDA shut down part of their ability to, to inform you whether or not you have. Yeah. So that happened recently. I think it was sort of a consequence to Angelina Jolie getting her boobs cut off essentially. Yeah. So was that misinformed what she did? Um, so I'm unfortunately, I haven't really read exactly how everything went down.

Speaker 4:          00:42:24       I just know that she did 23 and me and, you know, found out she had some, she had a polymorphism and one of the genes, but she didn't have cancer. No, no. So yeah, so that's a pro. I think that sort of precipitated the FDA. So the way they test for these genes is by something called PCR and it's, it's, it's not infallible, so you can, you know, they can give you back your results and say oh look, you've got this polymorphism is associated with x disease, which increases your risk for cancer by tenfold and it could have just spend a little air in the methods. So, you know, it's not like a full proof proof technique. And I think that's also part of the problem where it's like you're giving people back this genetic data and it's like they're taking it very seriously and obviously taking, going to extreme measures to do things, you know, like, like getting their boobs removed.

Speaker 4:          00:43:13       Um, but you still can 23 enemies not shut down like you can. Like I did it when they were already unable to give you, I'm tell you exactly what polymorphisms you have. Well, I'm a scientist so I didn't really care because they'd give you the raw data and I can actually go through the raw data, which I did and see what polymorphisms I have and I found out that I actually have one illegal of April before. So, so funny because it's really the only, the only gene I cared about, like all the other stuff. Like I, I did 23 in me because I was terrified of having April before and um, so I have it and if it turns out my dad gave it to me and my dad has it. So, uh, you know, like I said, having a. But we for just one to Lille of it is already you have a two to three fold increase risk for Alzheimer's.

Speaker 4:          00:44:05       If you look at people with Alzheimer's, between 65 and 80 percent of them have one, we'll have eight. But we've for a. So basically any person walking around with one Leo has about a 30 percent risk of getting Alzheimer's. And it really, really has to do with your, your environment, the way you interact with, with your environment, that that's going to shift you either into getting it or not. In what way? Multiple ways. Um, so, you know, the, the, the April before is, like I said, it's not working well and one of the ways. So amyloid Beta plaques building up in the brain, whether you're talking about at an exponential rate because of injury, traumatic injury to the brain. We're talking about just normal brain aging decades and decades and decades. There's April, we plays an important role in taking that amyloid Beta that's built up and bringing it to get degraded.

Speaker 4:          00:45:01       It gets rid of it. But if you have ap, we for it, it just for some reason can't bind to the, a Beta plaque as well. And so it can't remove it. So you're, you're talking about people that are not only accumulating more of it because, uh, you know, of other things that we for is doing, but they can't remove it as well. So you know, people that have to April, we three's, they've got a better mechanism of removing that amyloid Beta. Well, there's another way you can remove amyloid Beta from the brain and that's from getting sleep. I'm literally so sleep when you sleep, uh, what happens is your brain actually swells because cerebral spinal fluid gets pushed up into the brain. Your brain, you have this whole glymphatic system, you lymph vessels and things that are surrounding neurons and astrocytes and cerebral spinal fluid gets pushed into the brain when you sleep and it literally physically pushes out amyloid Beta plaques.

Speaker 4:          00:46:03       It removes amyloid Beta plaques and other dead debris. Things like that just trashed. That's building up in the brain. Um, and this is happening when you sleep. So if you don't sleep, if you're not getting enough sleep, then you know, people have this April we three, that's another way they can clear it out of the brain. But me, I really need to make sure I get enough sleep because, you know, I don't have that other repair mechanism to get rid of the amyloid Beta plaques. Has there been anything else? Does it meditation or anything along those lines? Um, in terms of the glymphatic system, I don't think that, you know, that seems to be a unique feature to sleep. Um, something that's happening when your, you know, especially particularly in when you're in rem sleep. Um, but you know why it's, it's rem sleep is triggering it.

Speaker 4:          00:46:53       Yeah. No, this is a new relatively new finding and I think we're going to in this decade. Oh yeah, like new as in just a couple of years ago. So it sounds so fascinating. There's something so significant and important is 2012, right? It's, there's, the human brain is very complicated and there's lots of little, you know, people that are doing research. They're looking at just little tiny aspect of this and this little, you know, because there's so many little details that you have to sort of interrogate to figure things out and how they're working. But the glymphatic system is something that's really cool because it gives a mechanistic explanation as to why. Another reason why sleep is so

Speaker 3:          00:47:38       important now. Does nutrition play any part in your brain's ability to do this or to do to mitigate this issue?

Speaker 4:          00:47:48       Yeah, so there's. I mean nutrition plays a huge factor. I mean if you look at people that are obese, you know, and slash or insulin resistance type two diabetic, these people also have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and they have an increased risk for a lot of age related disease. I mean they're, it's like they're accelerating their aging process in general, but the fact that they also have an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's is very, you know, it's interesting because it suggests something about not having the right diet is also involved. And there's multiple things going on here and you know, I can't figure all of them out, but you know, part, part of the reason is they've shown that inflammation, so obesity, you've got chronic inflammation going on also with type two diabetics and that inflammation actually causes a secretion of like proinflammatory cytokines, which are, you know, the activate the immune system, you know, because that's what happens when the body is like, wait, something's here.

Speaker 4:          00:48:56       That's not supposed to be. Get rid of it and this is the same thing that happens in the brain that causes the amyloid Beta plaques to start getting built up. Well, those things cross over at the blood brain barrier, inflammatory cytokines, crossover, get into the brain and start causing neuroinflammation. So it's really like they've even shown like if you inject, you can inject people with endotoxin. Endotoxin is what's like a part of the bacterial cell wall. It's released, you know, when bacteria are dying and it happens in the gut a lot, but it causes massive inflammation and you can inject people with endotoxin and it causes learning and memory deficits and it causes depressive symptoms. Um, also you can inject them with a pro inflammatory cytokines, interferon. And that interferon also causes depressive symptoms because you know, inflammation is being more and more linked to depression as well. But also inflammation in the brain is actually causing the aggregation of these amyloid Beta plaques to occur. So that's very interesting. How literally inflammation in your body, in your gut, you know, in the, in the peripheral part of your body, your body can affect your brain. It's your will. There's

Speaker 3:          00:50:15       I there been sorted in revenue again, but it haven't. There been some recent studies that have shown that the gut bacteria have kids that have Alzheimer's. Is, is usually an issue that a lot of children that have Alzheimer's also have issues with gut bacteria like autism or. What did I say? Alzheimer's. I'm sorry. Yeah, autism. We really, you know what I'm saying? Literally where's it coming out? Maybe I've been hitting the head too many times. Um, but yeah, autism spectrum disorders and even asperger's that there's been some sort of a connection to gut bacteria.

Speaker 4:          00:50:47       Yeah, yeah, definitely. I mean these people with autism do have a lot of inflammation in their gut and you know, having inflammation in your gut, what's going to happen? It's going to get into your brain and it's going to cause neuro inflammation in your brain. And another thing that inflammation in the brain does is it activates, you know, the. You've got prostoglandins that are being generated specifically eat two series prostoglandins. And the reason why that's bad in the brain is because generating [inaudible] series prostoglandins inhibits the brain's ability to release serotonin. So you basically can't release serotonin from like a presynaptic neuron, which is important and you want it, you need to release Serotonin, serotonin during a lot of things in addition to regulating mood, regulating behavior, regulating impulsive behavior, things like that, social behavior, but you know this, this inflammation that gets into the brain literally stop Serotonin from being released from the brain by, by inhibiting this, this. Sorry, by activating the two series and they've even shown like that study I was talking about people where they injected a pro inflammatory cytokine and they bake. They had came down with depressive symptoms if they gave those people epa like a very high dose of EPA. So I cone up Penta eicosapentaenoic acid, which is one of the Omega Threes that that mitigated the depressive symptoms like they didn't get the depressive symptoms because I think that what's happening is that inflammation is causing. One thing that EPA does very potent and potently inhibits the generation of

Speaker 3:          00:52:25       approximate sentence. So in that way, gut bacteria, especially taking in in the form of probiotics is probably a very important part of the human diet that is widely ignored by a lot of people, right? Yeah. Acidophilus. You're drinking Kombucha here. I love, I love my Kombucha. But what I said to you that this is the computer that's watered down so that it meets the whole food standards. No, I had no idea that this. Did you get this at whole foods? The one up the street. They have the regular stuff too. You gotta know what bottle to get and you need to have a license, like a driver's license. It shows you're over 21, but it's only one half of one percent. That's the cutoff. If it's more than one half of one percent alcohol by volume, then you have to have. It has to have to have a liquor license to sell it, which is preposterous. You can't get drunk off of it.

Speaker 4:          00:53:17       No, I had no idea that this was watered down. But yes, you know, probiotics are very important. Um, you know, you've, you want. So probiotics are doing things like generating lactic acid, which are does a lot of things. One is it's killing off these pathogenic bacteria that can't live in an acidic environment in the gut, but also like I mentioned, lactate, you know, lactates also can be used by Mitochondria. So you know, you're talking about giving a source of energy for your Mitochondria, you know, so that you can, it an important component of not having a lot of gut inflammation is, yes, the balance between pro biotics and, and the pathogenic bacteria. But it's also maintaining that gut barrier because you've got a lot of immune cells in your gut, you know, they're there because you don't want to eat something bad and you know, kill you.

Speaker 4:          00:54:18       So they're there and they're ready to, you know, fight off anything that's potentially pathogenic. So they have a purpose of being there. The way they don't continually, continually, uh, start fighting off things is because there's a barrier which is basically a mucous, um, it's called mucin and your gut cells secrete it. And this mucin is important for separating the immune cells in your gut from the bacteria. Because when that mucin gets broken down, then your immune cells are exposed to bacteria which are supposed to be in your gut, and they're like, oh, bacteria. And they start firing all these cytokines and you get, you start to get inflammation, which then breaks down the gut barrier more and it causes the same sort of cycle that I was talking about in the brain. You know, this sort of cycles going on can happen in the gut as well.

Speaker 4:          00:55:05       So things like eating a lot of sugar, you know, like can literally break down the Mucin, uh, you know, so it's like that's having that chronic inflammation is I'm doing a lot of things. So having the right balance of bacteria is one thing that's good, but also making sure that you're eating the right diet to make sure that you're, you know, you're giving yourself the right energy they need to, to do things that they're supposed to do. Like if it's, if we're talking about the gut making, Mucin and sugar actually fuels bad bacteria in the gut as well, right? Yeah. A sugar does feel bad bacteria in the gut. So a lot of the bad bacteria in the gut like to get them some sugar. So then you're talking about having overgrowth of the bad bacteria, you know, so it's, there's a lot weakens your immune system.

Speaker 4:          00:55:53       Yes. Sugar is significant. Immune system weakening inflammation in general. I mean, I think that also has a lot to do with, if you think about having, you know, a breakdown of the gut barrier and all this pathogenic bacteria which also break down the gut, like that's what they do also. Um, a lot of energy gets spent towards fixing that, fixing that, oh my God, I got to fix that. I got to repair this. And that takes away from brain phone. That takes away from Brent Stage Immune function because now you know, you're all, the energy's going towards the gut to repair this chronic damage that's also happening. And now you're, your immune systems. Don't you know when, when you're fighting off a disease, when you're fighting off a pathogenic, you know, whether it's viral or bacterial or whatever, like that requires a massive amount of energy, massive amount of energy.

Speaker 4:          00:56:46       That's an energy consuming process. So it's a matter of triaging this energy to the right place. It's like, okay, well, you know, if I, if my guts really healthy, I'm not inflamed, I have a good diet, I'm getting my micronutrients, I'm not eating a bunch of sugary crap, you know, the refined carbohydrates and things like that. Then you know, your, you don't have all this chronic damage happening that you, your, your energy is constantly. It's like a drain, an energy drain. It just keeps getting sucked into it and that, you know, that affects all sorts of other functions in the body. So, uh, and there's other explanations, but I like to think about it that way in terms of like a triaging of energy because it really just makes a lot of sense from an energetic standpoint. Looking at how energetically consuming I'm fighting off diseases and how energetically consuming repair is.

Speaker 4:          00:57:39       And people that are obese or type two diabetic, they're in a constant repair state constant. So it's, a lot of it is poor energy management because of your diet, because your energy is being taken away to a bunch of functions that you wouldn't order ordinarily needed for if your diet was good. Exactly, exactly. Like, um, it's really interesting the lab that I, uh, that I work in. I'm at Children's Hospital in Oakland. We work with a lot of insulin resistant, obese children, um, but we're also doing research on adolescents and even some of the parents of these children which are also obese, insulin resistant. Um, and uh, some of my colleagues in my lab have developed a, like a nutrient bar, they call it the core rebar and the nutrient. It's like a micronutrient dense bar where it has, you know, all sorts of vitamins and minerals and vitamin D and fiber has some polyphenols.

Speaker 4:          00:58:38       It has. Dha has just a bunch of good stuff instead of taking a bunch of vitamins, it's all in like a matrix with fiber and stuff so that things are absorbed better and digested. And, um, you know, my, my colleagues, I haven't been directly involved in this research because I look more at things like dna damage, but what, what my colleagues have found is that giving these obese people, whether we're talking about children or adolescents, adults giving them this micronutrient bar, um, if you compare like giving it to a lean person and you don't have them change their diet at all, it's like, you know, do what you're going to do, eat, eat what you're going to eat. But here, take this twice a day on top of that. Um, what we find is that one publication that was done on lean people, lean people like immediately it, their hdl goes up, you know, things start happening.

Speaker 4:          00:59:27       They make more glutathione, like all these positive changes occur, but obese people, it takes a lot longer to happen. Like it takes a couple of weeks. Whereas I actually takes even more than that. Um, I don't remember the exact amount of time, but, uh, it, it takes longer to happen. We think it takes longer because these people first, all that energy that, you know, this stuff, the micronutrients, all these things, it's, it's being shunted towards fixing, fixing, and eventually as they start to fix, then you start to see little changes happening. But it doesn't happen right away. Like it happens in people that are healthy and I use lean as a marker for healthy. I mean, it's not entirely accurate, accurate, but generally speaking, when exactly relatively speaking, glutosiome do you take glutathione supplement? Um, no, so that actually I wanted to talk about some of the possible, you know, Tbi, we're talking about traumatic brain injury and I talked about all this terrible stuff, but there are things that can be done to help.

Speaker 4:          01:00:31       Um, and glutathione is interesting because, so glutathione is, it's one of the major antioxidant in the brain, which is why it's very important, um, you know, as, as for for brain aging in general, and it's all been associated with a lot of studies in terms of the more glutathione in the brain, you know, decreased Alzheimer's, decreased damage in the brain going on. Um, you know, glutathione is just basically three amino acids that are together and it's glutamic acid, glycine, and I think assisting, so our body makes this inside of ourselves. We make it, we have an enzyme called Glutathione synthase and that enzyme takes those amino acids and puts it together. And then once we have glutathione, we have other enzymes that are able to use glutathione as a potent antioxidant. Glutathione Peroxidase, for example, this is another enzyme that uses that glutathione to prevent that reactive oxygen species damage I was talking about that happens like one of the early events with traumatic brain injury and it's also one of the early damaging events that happens just with normal brain aging, which is happening all the time.

Speaker 4:          01:01:42       We're making it right now in our brains. Um, so, uh, having gludethyon in the brain is really good and there's different enzymes that use it. So Glutathione Peroxidase, we'll use glutathione to, um, to basically reduce that oxidative damage so it can't damage the neuron or astrocyte or whatever, you know, cell type that it comes in contact with. Um, the problem is that with age, we decrease the expression of glutathione related genes and what that means is, you know, you have genes in your body and sometimes they can be expression just means you make more of it. So when you're, when it's being expressed, you're making more of it. So that's a thing. As we age, we decrease the expression, so like everything, things fall apart and we don't make as much of these glutathione related genes. Um, the thing with glutathione is you can't because it's made in ourselves.

Speaker 4:          01:02:33       There's no transport mechanism to get glutathione into the cell, like you know, you, you, you can transport it in immuno acids and the amino acids. Then this glutathione synthase uses those to make it in the cell, but there's no transport mechanism for glutamic acid, glycine and sustained together to get in. And, you know, you can't just, cells have a transport mechanism to get stuff inside. It's a regulated process. Um, so taking glutathione orally a is sort of pointless. Not to mention the fact that the guy isn't going to absorb it, either. It gets broken apart. Um, there is lyposomal glutathione.

Speaker 4:          01:03:16       Yeah, so Lyposomal, Glutathione, um, anything that's Lyposomal can bypass a lot of these transport mechanisms just based on, you know, the way. So first of all, liposomes can be absorbed by the gut but also they can get into cells because a lyposomal is basically like, you know, it's like a little liquid that has a fascial liquid by layer and it has whatever it has inside of it, in this case, glutathione which is soluble and it fuses with the Lipid biolayer of the cell membrane and basically just gets taken up. And so then whatever's inside of it goes into the cell. They've shown in. I've looked for studies to see, you know, lyposomal supplemental Lyposomal Glutathione. Like how I like is it getting into tissue, is it getting into the brain, for example, because that's important and I haven't found a lot of studies. I found one study that showed in rabbits that were given oral glutathione, oral liposomal glutathione were able to increase the glutathione levels in their brain, in their heart and also in the liver.

Speaker 4:          01:04:17       But they were given a massive dose. Like they were given 400 milligrams. And there are about 11 pounds, so that's like six grams for like 180 pound man. Four hundred milligrams in the physical form. Like what would you see? Is it, would it be, how many teaspoons would that be for row? Oh, I don't. I don't know. I mean you'd have to look at. I think if it's in a teaspoon, it tells you the like milligram content per teaspoon. I did look up online to see because I was like, I got to gave me some of this. And um, the problem is that most of the liposomal glutathione is really expensive and it's like between 100 milligrams and 400 milligrams per dose, per teaspoon or per capsule, whatever they do to a rabbit. They gave write a law. But a rabbit weighs 11 pounds. Swallows it too.

Speaker 4:          01:05:07       Aren't you supposed to hold it in your mouth? Under your tongue. Now they're, they, they, they enjoy. They give it to the, to the rabbit. Like they inject it in their mouth. Yeah. And the way I've been told to take the lyposomal glutathione is to Tuck it under your tongue or shorter under your tongue, holding your mouth for 30 seconds and then swallow it. Does that make any sense at all? And now I have no idea how that, what that would do, but the idea of being. Sorry, go ahead. No, I mean the point is, is that you supplement like Lyposomal Glutathione, maybe actually you may be getting it into your brain. It's just a matter of how much is it they didn't do a dose response in that study and if it wasn't so darn expensive, there's other ways to increase glutathione. But here's the thing.

Speaker 4:          01:05:48       So taking supplemental glutathione in the form of Lyposomal Glutathione, of course, any other supplemental glutathione is just useless. Yeah, it's useless pill form. Nothing. I think they have liposome. You can have it in pill form with letrozole. Yeah. But it just has to be. Light is almost the point, right? Yeah. If it's not lyposomal then you're not even getting it passed the gut let alone into the cell. So, um, but the other thing is, is that, okay, so here's the thing, your suppliers, your yourselves with this lyposomal glutathione, but the thing is, is that the enzyme that uses glutathione, glutathione peroxidase and these other enzymes, they decreased with age. So while you're bypassing the, you know, the decrease in the expression of Glutathione synthase, which is what makes glutathione, you're not bypassing the decrease in expression of this enzyme that uses it, that's using gludethyon to do its thing.

Speaker 4:          01:06:44       So that's also important and there's other ways that you can actually increase glutathione. But just interestingly, I came across a study recently, like 2014, very late, I think it was even just a couple months ago. It was, um, a traumatic brain injury study where they basically took mice and they induced traumatic brain injury by like putting pressure on their brain. And what happens is they noticed that the blood brain barrier is compromised. All those things that I was talking about happens. Water's flowing into the brain and saw you and all that and activation of immune function. All that stuff's happening. What they found was that if they put glutathione, they actually, because I did a pressure now schools are much thinner than a human's goals are and if they did a pressure room to the mouse school, there was like a little tiny crack in the skull and they could put glutathione on top topically where the crack is and it would get through into the brain and what they found was that if they did it within three hours of the injury, they, they abrogated like 70 percent of the cell death.

Speaker 4:          01:07:48       That happens. It was amazing, but it was a three hour time window because there will be done the humans. So I was wondering, well, so the thing that's what got me on this whole episomal trail, I was like, well we can't. First of all, we don't even know anything about the human skull. I mean we know about it, but we don't know whether or not you can put something topically after a traumatic injury and if it's going to get in there doing those studies. Now, because this was. This was actually a new discovery where it's like, Oh wow, you can

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       actually get through the skull and get into the, at least under an injury's type situation. So the idea would be that you would inject something into the skin on the scalp. Um, I don't know if they injected it, but yeah, that go under the French, the end of the needle. But whether or not that can be done in humans, I don't know. Like I said, I mean, first of all, humans have a much thicker skull then then. So. Right. But, um, so they're going to be testing that. But the other thing is, is like, okay, well can you. The key part of this study and my mind was they inhibited that reactive oxygen species, which is the instigator of this whole cascade, this neuroinflammatory, if they went downstream and try to inhibit, inhibit inflammation, it didn't have the effect because those things were already activated. You already had sell dead cells because it's the reactive oxygen species starting it and causing the cell death.

Speaker 1:          01:09:12       And that was how they were able to prevent like 70 percent of the cell death by giving that topical Glutathione. So, uh, that was, it was like, wow, well we've got to figure out how to do that. Yeah, exactly. And so, uh, the, there's other ways you can increase glutathione. The light is almost one. I don't know how robust, like I said, with that one study in rabbits, massive amount. We're talking about like for 180 pound man. And I don't even know how much some of these MMA fighters were. They probably weighed more than that. But you know, 180 pound man, he's talking about six grams of Liposomal Glutathione, which is a lot significant amount. I mean, considering how much, how costly is, it's just not economically feasible in my mind on these. The holding it under the tongue I've seen will be 12 of. That's okay.

Speaker 1:          01:10:01       Make sense? It'd be 12 people. It's sublingual that people do that to bypass the whole stomach acid thing. But you know, I don't know, maybe there's something I just don't know about with the Liposomal Glutathione. Sublingual means what, what does that actually mean? That means holding it in under the tongue is just the distribution method. Right? So to use lyposomal and use it in a sublingual way to Tuck in under. Does that make any sense? Would it go into your blood that way? Um, I mean, I don't know why it would be any different than swallowing it, but don't waste my time. I would just be not thinking about something that's obvious to me or, or it's just always time. There've been studies on that light bulb will be 12 taken sublingually. I haven't really read any. There may have been studies on that, but I haven't, I haven't looked in the literature of that.

Speaker 1:          01:10:55       I'll look it up right now. Yeah. So the other ways to increase. So like I mentioned, so there's, there's genes that are glutathione related genes and you can increase the expression of those genes were right away. Sublingual lyposomal glutathione shows up in the first thing that you, uh, you google. If you Google sublingual lyposomal glutathione is the first thing that pops up in Google. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's something I can certainly read about, but I just off the top of my head, can't think of why that would be more effective at getting into yourself saying right here, the only way to get significant amounts into your body is with lyposomal glutathione supplements. Uh, either ivy or injection is the other way. Yeah. Yeah. Injections another way. And that all obviously bypasses the whole intestinal absorption thing. Yeah. So what's interesting is they've done so other ways to increase glutathione would be, for example, a turmeric.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       Turmeric. Turmeric, yeah. I use that stuff. That's awesome. Well, they've shown. So the, there, there's two different bioactive components in it. One is the curcumin and that has. What that does, curcumin is, first of all, it's awesome. It gets into the brain and it's an anti, has antioxidant activity itself aside from Gludethyon, but it also increases the expression of all the good design related genes. So it turns on Glutathione Peroxidase, glutathione synthase, and another gene called Glutathione reductase, which actually recycles glutathione that's already been used or oxidized, which is really cool because now you're talking about ramping up the whole glutathione system. Like all of it, and, and this curcumin does this. Um, and so there was a, they've done studies in mice where they've done know, Tbi related studies for traumatic brain injury where they've, they've given them, they did intravenous and because of the, the effects of, you know, you, you basically metabolize curcumin immediately.

Speaker 1:          01:13:04       Um, it's like 40 minutes to an hour to say curcumin or cirque human. I always Kirk Hubert human. Yeah. I know I've said it wrong. What do you usually say? Human. Oh, now I think it's curcumin. Yeah. Just read it and try to understand. Oh really? Wow. So America have heard, but the actual turmeric to Merck termer tumor, I think there's an art. She, you are turmeric. Turmeric. Yeah. But whatever. It's not important to get good stuff. Yeah. It's like curries, you know, people using the curries, but it's sort of antiinflammatories not only anti-inflammatory, it inhibits the activation of nf kappa b, which is like this gene that turns on a whole variety of different genes involved in inflammation. So it's like blunting the whole inflammatory cascade and it activates all the glutathione genes. And on top of that, it has antioxidant activity itself, so it's like, you know, it's just like a triple whammy. So it's really cool. So curcumin is probably way better than taking lyposomal glutathione, I don't know,

Speaker 4:          01:14:11       because maybe in synergistic for synergistic. But the thing with Kirk curcumin is that it is also rapidly metabolized because it's a form it says, you know, biotic, which means it's not a vitamin or a mineral, it's something foreign to the body, you know, polyphenols, EGC, gds from green tea, all these things were the same. A lot of herbal academia, these are what are called xenobiotics. And what happens when you take a xenobiotic is it activates this whole pathway in the liver, which is like the liver is like, oh, there's this foreign thing in my body that's not supposed to be here. It's not a vitamin, it's not a mineral. Okay, I need to get rid of it. So it metabolize it's detoxifying, whatever. So, um, it gets metabolized rapidly. But there's something in black pepper called piperine. Piperine. Yeah. That inhibits the nobody xenobiotic metabolism.

Speaker 4:          01:15:01       So it's been shown in humans that if you give a coworker curcumin and piperine that you can increase the bioavailability of curcumin by 2000 percent in humans, which is pretty significant. And so that's kind of cool because I'm like, oh, well of course I ordered some curcumin with piperine and a tick for myself because I've got April before and it's just a really good thing. Um, but with traumatic brain injury they've shown that, you know, if they gave it to a, to mice to do it intravenously and they give them like a really high dose, it prevents, you know, the whole inflammatory response to the edema. Intercranial pressure, like all that stuff is dramatically improved. And this is again, it's like a time window where it was like, you know, a few hours after the trauma, after the trauma. So it's, you know, but I think maybe even before, if you're already, if you already have it in your system, you know, the question is how much is it, is it going to like, you know, prevent the acute immediate thing.

Speaker 4:          01:16:06       I don't know to what degree, but at least at the very least taking it every day, you're talking about inhibiting some of that neuroinflammatory cycle, that cycle. That's really, you know, vicious because once you have the plaques forum, which happens within hours after injury, then you're talking about, you know, it activating the whole cycle where it causes more and more years and years and years. So there's no negative repercussions to take my other stuffing their. Yeah. So in that study where they increased the bioavailability by 2000 percent, there was no adverse side effects. However, since piperine inhibits xenobiotic metabolism, full force, like you know, it's, it's inhibiting this very generalized pathway that's used to detoxify and get rid of all sorts of foreign things. Like even drugs like antibiotics, whatever, you know, your stands, whatever you take. I'm so, there is a concern like in my mind, I haven't done a lot of reading on this, you know, to see what's out there in literature, but just from my understanding of the mechanism, I think it's you don't want to go crazy because it's like if you're taking a bunch other stuff because it's going to increase the, the half life of all sorts of, you know, other xenobiotics which are just like I said, a lot of different herbal things or you know, things like curcumin and UGC, all that stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:17:22       So there's always that potential. It's like, well what else are you taking? Are you increasing the half life of that too by taking this piperine with it and what does that doing? So that's it. You should definitely be cautious in that, in that respect. But don't take too much of it. But yet I haven't seen too much of it. Like I know when I did some searching for like the Tumeric, but the thing is is that I like the tumeric and not just the curcumin because there's another compound in turmeric called tomorrow and aromatic turnaround and a study just came out like a couple of months ago on this where it's actually, it does. It does a lot of the same things that the curcumin does and that it inhibits inflammation, but it does something in addition to that, it actually repairs brain damage because it causes the proliferation of neural stem cells in your brain.

Speaker 4:          01:18:16       So I know it's like. And it was very robust. There's, there's two regions of the brain that you can actually. You have neuro stem cells, which means you can make new neurons. You've damaged neurons, neurons have died, you know, you want to replace those neurons and there's two regions of the brain that can do that. The sub brand tricolor zone and the dentate gyrus. And so tomorrow actually causes the polyphony ration of neural stem cells in the sub ventricular zone. And to some degree when they're giving these mice. I can't recall off the top of my head the dose, but they were giving him a pretty high dose and what they found was that it increased the proliferation of them by like, you know, 60 percent, which is pretty significant. A part of the problem with age is that, uh, these neuro stem cells, they start to proliferate less and as they start to proliferate less than you have less of them being made and you also have less a new neurons being made.

Speaker 4:          01:19:13       So net less neurogenesis. So if you think about in the context of someone who's undergone a traumatic brain injury, they have undergone, they've had massive amounts of cell death occurring from that reactive oxygen species from that inflammation. You know, they've lost neurons. That's, that's, that's a fact. So if you can have something that's boosting the proliferation of their neuro stem cells, that's a great thing. It's not just a great thing for people that have had an injury. It's a great thing for just normal brain aging. Um, I think it's also a great thing for people that are susceptible to neurogenic diseases like myself, because I have one of these April, we four wheels, you know, so I'm, you know, I've got to be really careful because I can't repair damage as well. If I can make sure I grow new neurons, then you know, that's, that's a good thing. I didn't know there was anything that you could eat. The could help grow new neurons. I'd never heard of it. Yeah. So tomorrow is, stimulates, stimulates the, of

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       the neuro stem cells in the suburban Tricolor zone. Um, this, this study was really came out like less than two months ago. That's incredible. It's pretty incredible. Yeah. I'm so you could get smarter for meeting today. They did get smarter. They had improvements. Now, I mean take this with a grain of salt in the sense where it's like the whole bioavailability thing and humans and how much are we. That's always the issue. It's like, okay, well they're giving mount mice, you know, a much higher dose and you know, so that it's like bypassing, first of all they're injecting it in some cases so it's bypassing the whole getting absorbed. But the fact that it occurs is hopeful because it's like, well eventually we'll find a way to overcome some of the bioavailability issues, which, you know, we kind of are. So is the Bio availability issue mitigated it all by a large dose is taking, what do you recommend as a dose?

Speaker 1:          01:21:00       Like a thousand milligram pills or what I have of turmeric? Well in the case of the Mouse Studies, it's mitigated by a large dose that's given intravenously. So I need to start shooting. So you don't have, but how do you shoot up turmeric? Yeah, I, you know, I don't know. I, and, and the question is they bought up your book, the suppository. They have clinical trials that are, they're doing now with people with Alzheimer's or people that have dementia early, you know, early dementia science. They're doing this with a tumeric and I hope they use piperine also are using depositories or there might just, I don't know, I don't know what they're using because a lot of studies have come out recently in a different, in different model organisms where they've looked at worms and flies and mice and they're and they have all these different neurodegenerative, you know, sort of models where they look and study this stuff and they find hands down this tumeric is doing some cool shit.

Speaker 1:          01:21:55       Like it's, it's awesome. And these studies are the administering it orally or the using injectables if talking about mice then there's a lot of them have been injectable and this is where the studies are coming out. So these aren't on humans yet, but they did get smarter. The people that they did it to, that got smarter. They did. So the people and that, those were mice. The mice get smarter, the mouse performed better on learning and memory. Yes, yes. Yes. So, but let's see, what was the other. There was another interesting thing about the. Oh, I know what I wanted to bring up. It was, I got sort of sidetracked when I was talking about the neural stem cells that are in the brand tricolor zone. What's really interesting about this is that they, um, they readily go to the olfactory bulb, no smell, so their sense of smell is a good predictor of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease and even just all caused mortality. Like literally you can have decreased sense of smell and you know, it can be a good predictor of your next, you know, five year mortality. Um, and it's like, why is this sense of smell such

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       a good predictor of, you know, people that are going to get Alzheimer's soon. Also people that may just die soon and re we're finding out again, just recently within the past couple of months that the olfactory bulb requires a constant supply of neural stem cells because the olfactory neurons which are in your factory bulb, which is just right in front of your brain. Those neurons which are responsible for smelling things, you know, and they send signals to the brain so that you can, you know, experience it, so to speak. They require a constant supply of neural stem cells, which is coming from the sub ventricular zone. And so, uh, when you start to, to, to have that process diminish where you can't supply those new stem cells to the olfactory bulb, your sense of smell goes away. And so that's why also it's a predictor of Alzheimer's because you're literally losing the ability to know, don't people are born with people are born with a terrible sense of smell.

Speaker 4:          01:24:00       That doesn't mean that you don't, that you're not making neural stem cells. So please don't freak out. Like there's other reasons why you cannot have a good sense of smell. The reason this was impacting me right now is because I know people who've been knocked out and lost their sense of smell. Yeah. So, wow. So that's, um, the, uh, the, the tomorrow and that was given to these mindset, improve their sense of smell and improved. Um, you know, there's, this is, there's another thing also with this neuro stem cell. I'm, I've known for some time that this sense of smell is a good predictor of Alzheimer's. But in just until I had, I just didn't understand why and this whole understanding the neuro stem cells being having to replace it like constantly. So it's literally like marker. It's like a marker for brain, your brain's ability to repair damage in your brain.

Speaker 4:          01:24:51       Um, I remember last time I was on the podcast, you mentioned that study where they gave young blood to old mice and they essentially made them again, well I'm going to bring this back to the nose. So I became very interested in that study. And so essentially what they found is that there is something in the blood that secreted in. So it's in the plasma actually, and it's called a growth differentiation factor 11. And it goes, it's made. It's made more readily in young blood. So it decreases with age, like everything does. And what happens is this growth differentiation factor 11 goes to the brain, goes to the muscle and it stimulates stem cell proliferation and it does it in the separate ventricular zone. And so when they gave it, like they did this, when they did it in mice, what they found was that the mouse, the mice, you know, there are tissues were less age, the only way you can reverse tissue aging in that to that degree has got to be related to stem cells because when you already have all this damage, like the only way you're going to repair that damage is by replacing and replenishing that population with new cells.

Speaker 4:          01:26:02       And because as we age, the ability to do that, our stem cell, the ability proliferation decreases and all that stuff decreases. We can't do it as well. And also, you know, the more reactive oxygen species, we get them more. Those cells start dying. So the fact that you know, these tissues were able to reverse the aging was really, you know, obviously indicative of stem cells when they found was indeed this growth differentiation factor is in the plasma. More bits and young people and it's causing the proliferation of neural stem cells and the stubborn tricolor zone. And also in muscle. What they found was they could even isolate that growth differentiation, differentiation factor. And you know, inject it into old mice and you would have the same effect, which is really cool because that gives hope for isolating it in for, you know, basically people using it as a source to stimulate proliferation of stem cells.

Speaker 4:          01:26:53       And there's actually a clinical trial that started this month at Stanford where they are injecting plasma from young individuals that are younger than 30 and they're giving them to people with mild Alzheimer's, older people with mild Alzheimer's and they're going to check the, the cognitive effects, you know, immediately after and also longterm. So, but the whole stem cell thing in the nose. And it's very interesting how it's like the nose that stem cells, neural stem cell, more capacity to make more of them can be, you know, you can see the status of that by your sense of smell and the fact that you've observed fighters that have had decreased sense of smell that is alarming.

Speaker 3:          01:27:38       Well, there's one guy named Gary, good rich. He's a real veteran mixed martial arts fighter who was around during the early days of the UFC and he fought in k, one. He fought in pride. He's like kind of a legendary mixed martial arts character and he's dealing with some pretty significant traumatic brain injury now from, from years and years of fighting, and that's one of the issues that he had and he lost his sense of smell and that makes total sense what you're saying. Yep.

Speaker 4:          01:28:06       I'm sorry to hear that. You know, I, I, like I said, the, the April we, fourth thing is something I think is really, really significant and I think that yeah, they've shown it with traumatic brain injury from car accidents. They've shown it with stroke, they shown it in boxers. You know that having one of those deals, you're talking about a tenfold increased risk of screwing up your brain.

Speaker 3:          01:28:30       You think that that's something that they should screen for when they give someone a license to fight. I think that if I were a fighter, I would want to know, I'd want to know my risk and you're, you're completely missing the psychology of a fighter. Fighters feel invulnerable. Like the idea of a fighter is that everybody else is going to get fucked up, but not me. I'm going to be different. I'm going to rise above. I have a championships, heart champion, champion's heart, champion's mindset. I'm going to get through things that other people can't. You're not

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       going. You're not going to. If you have an April, we for a little weird. You're not. Yeah. You're, you're bringing science into the world of fighting. I, I would love for that to happen because you're talking about possibly changing the lives of like, you know, 25 percent of fighters. Fighters would still want to fight a guarantee. You a good majority of them.

Speaker 3:          01:29:23       I still want to fight and they would just say, well, across our bridge when I come to it, well, if I start feeling the difference, but the real issue is once you start feeling the issues, you've only touched the tip of the iceberg of the amount of damage that you've actually

Speaker 1:          01:29:36       correct actually acquired. Yes. And once you start becoming symptomatic in the sense where your memory, short term memory becomes affected. Like what we were talking about with denny and our friend that is typical of, you know, a 80 year old human being that is acquired 80 years of inflammatory reactive oxygen species damage in the brain, you know, then you start to see those symptoms.

Speaker 3:          01:30:03       Do you remember there was a story a few years back of a football player. Do you remember the football player? The fell off the truck, Jamie. He jumped Henry, Chris Henry. That's it. He was involved in some sort of a dispute with his girlfriend or his wife, forget which one. And she took off with his truck and he chased her and jumped on the back of the truck and fell and fell off the truck while she speeding down the road, cracked his head open, died. They did a autopsy on him and found out that he had the brain of a 70 something year old Alzheimer's Alzheimer's patient. And he was in his twenties, wasn't he? Yeah. Find out how old he was. I'm, I'm, uh, I want to say he was 28 years old and he had me. This is a guy who had not expressed any issues as far as like there's a bunch of different athletes now that are coming out and there has been an hbo real sports piece that they just did this past weekend that I watched about football players, violent expression that they're directly relating to this traumatic brain injury that they're suffering from football. But this young man, 26, 26, 26 and he had see if you can find the article about him having. Did it, does it say he had about his brain issue. There was an article where they did the autopsy on her research is find brain trauma and Henry Twenty six years old.

Speaker 1:          01:31:30       Chronic and see. I can't say that. Encephalopathic encephalopathy. Yes. Well there's multiple things that you brought up that is to say we could discuss. I think one is definitely the accelerated brain aging that's happening from the repeated traumatic events where it's, it's doing that

Speaker 3:          01:31:55       school football, college football and the pros. You're just into things

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       like a good chunk of your life and, and, and I did see one press release or some article that was like 74 at a 76 or something like nfl players or something somewhat, don't quote me on those statistics, but something that was very, very, almost like 90 percent of them had a Beta amyloid Beta plaques in their brain and Tau tangles in the brain that were characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Seventy six out of 79. And this is post post death postmortem. Yes, yes, exactly. That's depression. That's after birth. She gave birth because they asked me if I was mad. That's how they got hit. Um, but yeah, so, uh, the, the other really interesting thing about this traumatic brain injury is the effects on behavior. You mentioned you ran over there, he ran chase chase car and jumped on the truck and go off of it.

Speaker 1:          01:32:58       That's impulsive behavior. I mean, that's like not, that's not a normal thing. You don't just chase after a truck and try to jump on it while it's moving athletes and fighters and like really that's a really common, like the sort of impulsive behavior. It's super common for fighters so. Well, there are definitely. There's one aspect of the fighting culture. I mean, you know, there. Yeah. Yeah. That's part of. It's also what leads you to do that in the first place is you have this ability to do like a lot of them. I mean, I think before they ever got any brain damage whatsoever. They're impulsive people. That's what led them to do fighting in the first place. I see. You think that was part of the civil? No, I mean I'm guessing she certainly is. I'm, I'm guessing, based on my own life, so I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:33:45       I think that, you know, people so impulsive behavior that's related to impulsive aggression, that can be self directed like suicide or self harming. It can also be like aggressive towards others. Impulsive behavior can be like not longterm planning where you're just not. You're not weighing out all the possible you know, events that can occur and what's more likely to happen or not. You know, you're just impulsively do something. There are polymorphisms that are related to serotonin related genes that are associated with that because Saratonin plays a very important role in regulating impulsivity, so people that are already genetically predisposed because they have a polymorphism. Again, that gene variant that I was describing earlier when I talked about a pui, they have a gene variant in serotonin synthesis gene or in the release serotonin release or on the transporter on the receptor. You know, they've shown that there are associations with these and impulsivity. You know, Saratonin is one of the things that happens. I've talked about this before on the podcast, you know, you can deplete. People have Saratonin by taking away their trip to fan and become impulsive

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       and they become impulsive in terms of impulsive, aggressive things. You know, when they do sorts of tests. And that's partly because what's happening is behavioral disinhibition. Behavioral disinhibition is, you know, they're signaling that's happening. That's going on from the orbital frontal cortex part of the brain, and it's happening. It's signaling to other regions of the brain, like the Amygdala, and I don't understand exactly how serotonin does this or what his specific role is. I'd have to really dig into two more neuroscience for that, but I do know that it does play a very important role in that when you take away the Serotonin disinhibition occurs, which means disinhibition means now usually you're having inhibitory signals happen that say, okay, you know, you can't just go out and do something crazy. Like, you know, you can't do it and your brain knows that and there's certain signals that's happening.

Speaker 4:          01:35:51       When you take away Serotonin, those signals go away. And so now that inhibitory signal isn't there. Um, this is something that I, you know, like I was doing some reading on some of these nfl players that have gone crazy and committed suicide. I'm like, junior sale I think is one who shot himself in the heart, you know, because he specifically wanted his brain to be examined, examined, and there was another football player, I don't recall his name, but he also committed suicide. I think he shot himself in his heart as well. And then there was a pro wrestler, um, and I don't know his name, but he liked it, a murder suicide. So these are all, you know, there's probably multiple things going on. The, the, the orbital frontal cortex. So that plays a very important role in inhibitory actions. But when things start to get messed up in that region of the brain, including the Serotonin, and I think, like I mentioned, the inflammation in the brain.

Speaker 4:          01:36:53       When you generate a two series prostoglandins, which happens when there's inflammation in the brain, you, they've shown, they've shown this in many different studies in mice. You inhibit the release of Serotonin. So you take that, you know, in, in of itself, and you're talking about not having as much of that Serotonin plus the damage to the orbital frontal cortex. And all these things are compounding. You're talking about like just massive changes in behavior that are occurring and then on top of that you may have someone that is, like you said, they, they go into these sorts of sports for a reason. They're already impulsive, so they, you're talking to people that may already be genetically predisposed, they may already have some sort of alteration in their serotonin function and now they're depleting their serotonin release on top of that and they've got damage to their orbital frontal cortex. It's like these things are compounding to cars, just total impulsive behavior and you know, where they become aggressive and they do crazy things that they normally otherwise wouldn't do because they'd have that impulsive. I mean, sorry, they'd

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       have an inhibitory signal saying, no, don't do this. You can't do this. So, you know, I think it's very damaging in the respects of changing the behavior of these people to where they just become even more impulsive and aggressive and they're already, you know, in this, in the case of fighters, they're already fighting. It's already a culture thing, you know. So, uh, it's, it's something very interesting with the serotonin system also in the interaction between inflammation and Serotonin and they've even shown the opposite, like when you take people and you give them an acute dose of like an Ssri and you flood the brain with Serotonin just acutely just for like, you know, a couple of hours people become more adverse to harming others. Like when you do give them a, you know, like uh, one of those questionnaire things, they become more adverse to harming others even at the expense of saving other more people.

Speaker 1:          01:38:52       Uh, so serotonin is somehow regulating these types of, I don't know, you know, and there's neuroscientists and philosophers and all this that are doing this research and trying to understand it doesn't make sense so that happy people would be more kind and less likely to harm others. And I've found personally that people that are most oppressed or the most likely to fucking slash and burn those, those are the people that want to take everybody down with them. It's usually the people that are really depressed that are looking to make other people feel bad. Yeah. I think happiness is a is a component, but I also think the impulsivity is another component that's important. It seems that Serotonin, if that really is what's going on, that giving someone a large dose of Serotonin would actually make them less likely to want to harm other people. That's a pretty significant thing.

Speaker 1:          01:39:42       Yes. That, that study was published, I don't know, like 2010 or so I think and they're, they're looking into, they're doing a lot of follow up studies on that. Like you know, there's a difference between giving someone an acute dose of Serotonin, flooding their brain and doing it constantly, you know, because when you're constantly doing it, then there's feedback loops and you start to decrease the amount of serotonin receptors and the Bra. Yeah. So that's so, you know, but anyway, it's just the fact, what they're trying to understand is what is serotonin doing? Like why is it that by giving someone a huge dose of it, they become more adverse to harming others and I don't know the answer. You know, it just seems like there'd be happier. Right? I mean, if you, if your Serotonin, part of its function is to promote happiness, right? It's just one of the reasons why Ssri or termed antidepressants because people who are on depressants, they take these regulators are serotonin and gives them a big uptake in it and then Ooh, they feel better. I don't know if it's as clear cut, but it does, you know, I'm simplifying. It does affect mood. Yeah, it does. You do feel better. Um, it, they've shown also the Serotonin, a Ssri

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       effect, pain like you pain, so you actually feel less pain. So it's not just a matter of feeling happier. It's also a matter of not feeling as much pain. And there's similar pathways between physical pain and social pain.

Speaker 3:          01:41:06       I have a friend who had depression issues and before being on Ssri, he was like really angry. Like fuck everybody, fuck this guy. And like he would say horrible things about people. Once he got on the antidepressants, all that went away now couldn't care less what other people do. Couldn't care less. Like who cares? Like someone's doing something bad or someone saying something bad or whatever. He's like, I don't care, just doesn't bother me. I'm not, I don't want to harm that person. You know? It's a complete shift in his mindset.

Speaker 4:          01:41:38       Yeah Sir. Serotonin does affect that, uh, that aggressiveness, you know, like I, you know, it's, it's definitely playing a role.

Speaker 3:          01:41:44       Well, it's more of a lash out sort of a thing, but I think there's, one of the issues with depression is that people that are depressed and people that do have depression issues, they kind of want to bring other people into their world almost like they feel like that people, other people being happy is some somehow taking something away from them,

Speaker 4:          01:42:05       you know? Yeah, yeah, I do. I think, you know, they want to surround that. They want other people to be miserable, miserable with them. I think in this sense also where it's like, because it's justification, it's like I'm here, then it must be okay and you know, if everyone here is also here with me, then yeah, then I'm not, I'm, I'm not abnormal. There's not something wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:42:25       I've always wondered how much of that is what's going on psychologically, how much of that is what's in their life and how much of the psychology and how much of what's going on in their life. Like what kind of feedback they're getting on daily day to day basis in their life is actually regulating their human neurochemistry. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:42:42       No. There is a very complex interaction going on between the environment and the neurochemistry and this has been demonstrated, you know, in a lot of different animal studies where it's like, so you can actually alter someone serotonin system by having an early life, you know, stressful event happen. So you know, like in the case of mice and early life, stressful event is when the pups, when you're born you're a pup and you're not nurtured as a pop. So when you're nurtured, you know the parent mice will lick the pops and when that, when they get licked you will. They release Serotonin in their brain when they're really, really young. And when happens, when they released her tone into the Brown, they're really young. It's all sorts of feedback, epigenetic feedback loops. So epigenetics is changing the expression of their genes without actually altering the DNA nucleotide sequence, like a polymorphism is different sequence of DNA, but epigenetically they'll change the receptors in their brain that respond, that respond to like Glucocorticoids, like stress hormones, and they incur.

Speaker 4:          01:43:47       So when they have serotonin there, they increased the amount of receptors, which means when they have more receptors to glucocorticoids, your body doesn't make us shoot as much cortisol and much much for the glucocorticoids out because it has a lot of receptors. There's a feedback so they're calmer, they're happier, they're not as anxious, but if you take that away and those pumps don't get licked, they don't make Serotonin in early development and those glucocorticoid receptors, you don't have as many. And so the body is constantly. It's like in a stress state and these, these mice grew up very, very anxious, fearful. I'm just, you know, their, their, their brains develop differently. Is that the same with children that grow up in orphanages where they don't get cuddled and. Yeah, I mean that's what I would be. That's what I think. It seems likely that you take that in combination.

Speaker 4:          01:44:38       So you've got someone who's already genetically predisposed. I like, you know, the serotonin system because it, you know, we're talking a lot about that. They're already, they already have a polymorph and these things, polymorphisms are common. You've got people with polymorphisms in Serotonin transporters, serotonin synthesis genes or their receptors, and so they're already kind of vulnerable. They're already, you know, they're not making as much serotonin or they're not responding it like, like normal, so they're already genetically vulnerable to that. And then you couple that with an early stressful event and then it just screws things up even more. Uh, and also diet is coupled to it. I'm going to have talked about vitamin deregulating serotonin synthesis. EPA regulates the release of it. They've shown that. I mentioned the two series. Prostoglandins inhibits the release when you, when you put EPA, and it mitigates that. So having an anti inflammatory Omega three, you know, is very important for people that are genetically predisposed to have their serotonin system screwed up.

Speaker 4:          01:45:41       You take that person anything about someone who's already on the fringe who's already waiting to be tipped over into mental illness or behavioral types of behaviors that are non productive and you and you take their nutrition, they don't, they have poor nutrition there, inflammation going on, so all the energy is going sucked into the wrong place and not up here where it needs to be. And then you add stressful environment. I mean you're talking about dynamite for mental illness and not just stressful environment, but negative feedback or negative environment. Yeah. Poor a poor relationships, poor friendships, real hardcore negativity. Yeah. They've even shown actually in terms of the relationships, this, this whole behavioral epigenetics, so to speak, is kind of what it's called. And it's very interesting because it's talking, it's like the relationship between what's happening in your environment and how that's changing, you know, things that the neurochemistry in your brain either at the level of neurotransmitters or receptors or whatever they've shown that another.

Speaker 4:          01:46:45       So another thing that happens when you're a cuddled, you're young and they do a lot of these studies in mice, um, obviously, but you release like, like for example, when your mother licks you, you also, there's also oxytocin being released and oxytocin sort of that bonding hormone that's made where the mother bonds with the trial. But also it's, it's, it's pair, you know, mate bond bonding as well. And so when you take that away, uh, when, when you know, like, like if you're not coddled or you don't get that attention early, like that early attention from the mother in early life, then what happens is that the, the offspring grow up and they make less oxytocin. Like some epigenetic changes are happening where now they're not making as much. So now they grow up and they don't bond to their children and it perpetuates and they don't bond to their relations.

Speaker 4:          01:47:36       So they have poor relationships. Similar thing happens with Vasopressin, which is, it's very a vasopressor and regulates a lot of things. It's also an antidiuretic, but interestingly it's also made in the brain and it's important for male, like males respond to it in the context of meeting. So like for example, they, they've shown in like prairie voles, which are rodents that are monogamous. They, um, they have higher level, they have a higher level of receptors for that. Vas are present in their brain compared to other species that are not monogamous. And when they take away, when researchers take away the ability to take away those, they basically antagonize the receptors so it can't bind Vasopressin, those prairie voles which are monogamous and they, they, they, they mate for life. All of a sudden that goes away. Let's take it. They become freaks. Like, yeah, polygamist and stuff.

Speaker 4:          01:48:30       And they've shown this in like nonhuman primates to where I think it was like Alma Alma keys. They're monogamous and you look at it and you compare them to, um, reduce monkeys that are non non monogamous. There the difference is also at the receptors for bas or precedent that monogamist ones have a high density of them in their brain. And then another study came out looking at humans. I'm in a Swedish cohort. They looked at males that were in monogamous relationships that were married, had successful relationships versus ones that were divorced. I'm also ones that were just single and they found that there was an association again with these vasopressin receptors in the brain where the men that were, uh, had failed marriages, for example, or we're not likely to even get married. They had less of these vasopressin receptors. Um, so it's really interesting that there's these social hormones that we're making that are really changed epigenetically. So these are also, like, for example, in the prairie voles, they release more of this Vasopressin when they're meeting, so like the act of mating with their monogamous, with their partner that they partner with for life. Uh, there's something that goes on with that meeting event, that bonding event that makes, makes them more monogamous. Exactly. And it's happening. I don't remember if, I think it was happening at the level of the receptor. Yes. They were making more of the receptors. The meeting event caused them to strengthen that bond

Speaker 3:          01:49:59       more. No, it'd be fascinating. Is if they could figure out some way to experiment with Benobos who are patently polygamous. Bonobos are freaks. They just have sex with everybody there. The only. The only frictions. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they're. They're homosexual. The only restrictions are the mother won't meet with the suns. That's it. Everything else is a free party and it would be fascinating if they could figure out a way to introduce that.

Speaker 4:          01:50:28       Could you. Can you introduce it? Yes. Yes. You can make a transgenic and until recently, transgenic by Informa Diet or a transgenic in the context of, of biology on means that we take a piece of DNA, like a gene that does something and we put it into any species of rodents and we make it like we can give rodents, human genes and study their effects are we can give Rodin's genes that we give them more of them and see what happens so we can take away. Got started. Probably so fucking disaster. So we do it in rodents. That's the chimps. So now with this, we. There was some limiting ability with the cloning techniques and how we do it, but now we can do it more readily, so I think those studies are going to be done yet. But you're right. There's always the variability that you. The chaotic factor. It's like, well, what if wake up, what if they like become really smart? Start over, right?

Speaker 3:          01:51:29       Sure. But the Zune, the chimps have fucking welding masks on making sorts. That would be Kinda cool. Yeah, in a way. Terrifying. Yes. I mean a lot meaner than people, but nobody aren't. Yeah. Which is really fascinating because they're like the least violent of all the primates or one of the least violent. They almost never harm each other because they're having so much sex wonder, but. But chimps have a lot of sex too. They don't have as much sex as Banabos for sure, but Benobos have so much sex. They don't use them in captivity. You never see Benobos at the zoo and the reason being is that they're just so hypersexual. They people would find a defensive because western culture so ridiculously suppressed. If we had benobos in the zoo, we couldn't say, well, this is the thing. What you're looking at here is a normal natural expression of Banabos. They like to have sex with each other. They solve disputes with sex, they use sex for bargaining and we know that chimps use bargaining for sex. And I had an old bit about it was because one of the first things that they ever discovered about chimpanzees when they started experimenting with money, they started giving chimps coins and they could give those coins and get fruit with it. So the first thing they did was give the coins the females and have sex with them. We're really the thing, the, the,

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       once they realized the coins represented food, they would give the coins, the females and the females would just have fucking stacks of coins to the ceiling and all these males would be having sex with them. That associative learning where then they immediately been able to realize, okay, this prostitution is genetic. Um, yeah. Interestingly, back onto the. I mean, I guess it's not really prostitution, but back on the whole life style and how that changes your behavior. They've also shown that in mice when they female minds, so when female mice, when they're not cuddled. So there's a lot of this in behavioral epigenetics stuff that they're doing. They do a lot of studies on, okay, what happens in early development? You know, what happens to the brain, like if you're not, you know, if you don't get attention, you don't get the cuddling and licking. How do you grow up like what's going on?

Speaker 4:          01:53:41       And with the females, what happens too is they, uh, when they don't get cuddled and licked and all that, they grow up with more estrogen receptors in their brain and they become more sexually receptive. So estrogen is make, makes females more sexually receptive. And so what ends up happening is usually when you put a male mouse into a cage with a female mouse, she may or may not meet with them. And if you put, if you put one male mouse into the cage with her, this is a normal, like a mass attach, cuddling coddling. And all that, uh, you put the second male mouse in, let's say she made it with the first one, you put the second one in and it's, she's not going to just meet with this guy. It's like she already made it, you know, she's not, she's not promiscuous where she just having sex and after sex after, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:54:25       But what happens with those female mindset grow up without that cuddling, they have increased, epigenetically increased expression of estrogen receptors in their brain to become more promiscuous. And you put it, you put a male mouse in again and it will make. And you put another one in and it made. So it's changing the sexual behavior. Now, you know, whether I'm sorry, but isn't there a correlation with human beings? Because human beings are come from troubled childhoods with the lack of love tend to be more promiscuous. Yeah, I mean, I agree. You know, obviously I can't make that statement, but yeah, you did. The more we learn about, you know, how these early life events are affecting behavior of our own brain and also of our offspring. Um, you know, like the more we can start to apply this to humans, I think it makes sense, you know, I think there's definitely a correlation between um, growing up in poverty, growing up, you know, with, without having that family there, that love nurturing supportive system, whether it's a single parent, it's not, it's not necessarily the case.

Speaker 4:          01:55:30       I'm not saying like I grew up in a single parent home and you know, I'm not out there frequently. Yeah, freaking getting free gun kind of. I get my science free gone, but I'm a little different. So yeah, I, I, I, I'm just saying I don't want to like say that everyone, there's definitely no exceptions, but yeah, but I do think that our increased understanding at the biochemical level of how the environment changes the brain, you know, whether we're talking about behavior, cognitive function, you know, in general is very interesting and I think that it should be extrapolated and sort of apply to humans and in hopes that we can start to make society better. You know, it's just so fascinating to me that a human being is essentially the product of an equation. The equation of all these different hormones, all these different neurotransmitters, all these different epigenetic factors, all these different life experience factors, all these different things.

Speaker 4:          01:56:32       It's just that, that's what producers are. Rhonda, Patrick. I mean, it's, it's amazing. It's so, it's so complex. I agree with you. I think, you know, there's a lot of years the things that we cannot control, you know, and the things that we cannot control, our, you know, our polymorphisms that we're born with, like me being born with apo e four, I can't control that or it's hard to control, you know, being raised in a family where let's say, you know, you're from a single parent family and your mom's working hard. She doesn't have time to, you know, you don't, you don't get as much nurturing. Dad's gone, you know, that sort of thing. You can't choose that. I mean, you, you're very young. You know, when you're a young infant and young toddler, I mean these, your brain is very susceptible to all these environmental interactions that's epigenetically changing the way your brain is working.

Speaker 4:          01:57:27       Um, but things that you can change are, you know, as you know, diet diets are really important. One that you can change, you know, the whole ballgame. Basically. It's, you know, you're talking about, I really think there is a complex interaction between genetics, epigenetics, diet, and you know, I'm not the only one that thinks that, I mean there is, there's people researching all these different complex interactions. But I think what I like to focus on is the part that we can control and the part that we can control right now. And that is, you know, our lifestyle. We, what we, what we as an adult at least, you know, obviously when you're really young you're sort of beholden to your parents feeding you and also, you know, that's the sort of unfortunate. But at a certain point, you know, it's like when you're able to realize what's going on, I think that trying to control what you can is really important. So getting a good diet, you know, things like getting enough Omega threes, EPA and your brain is literally an antiinflammatory. It's extremely, extremely important. Like, you know, this study where they're injecting people with cytokines that are causing inflammation, that gives them depression and yet if they take epa with it, they don't get depressed. Yeah, that's pretty. That's a massively

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       significant. It would be a huge issue with children as well. I, I definitely think it's a huge issue with children. They have these, um, these, the, there's various um, uh, fish oil, gummy bears and these different little candies that you can give the children. They don't really taste like candy, the context quite a bit shittier than candy, but they're sweet enough so they feel like a treat the kids. I think that it's extremely important, especially early on to get to get that EPA. I know I've talked about in the past, Dha has always talked about because it's high, there's a high level of it and the brain and I even talked about it in the context of Krill oil. I did some research after our last conversation. We had a conversation about that. That's one of the things that keeps coming up on my message board guys wanting to.

Speaker 1:          01:59:31       Folks wanted to question you about that. Like what is the difference trend Krill oil and fish oil and what, what are the benefits of curoil and also how do you know whether crow was rancid because that appears to be an issue with Krill oil. Really friendly with crude oil. Interesting. Okay. Well I'll tell you what I know and I'll definitely tell you what I don't care. So the thing you know, the reason Dha and EPA are very important is because they're, they're both an important part of the brain in terms of Dha. It's very important because it's part of the cell membrane. I'm like new neurons are astrocytes and other cells in your body, but particularly it's concentrated in the gray matter of the brain. So it's very important. The difference between fish oil and Krill oil. And you know this, this is something that I made a video on recently is is that sufficient oil is usually a molecularly distilled because they use it to fish, have higher on the food chain and they've got concentration of more bad things like mercury and they're fat and so they molecularly distill it to get rid of that junk because we don't want to take a bunch of, you know, mercury.

Speaker 1:          02:00:44       And also they, they distill it because they want to concentrate the fish, the EPA and Dha to make it more concentrated. So what they do is they take the fit, the EPA and Dha and they put this like ethanol backbone. They usually, it has a glycerol backbone on it, which makes it a triglyceride and they take that off and they do this ethanol backbone. It's part of the molecular distillation process. How they distill it, get the impurities away. But then most companies leave it like that. They don't put it back in a triglyceride form. So they have this ethanol backbone, which is not recognized very well by pancreatic lipase, is in our small intestine. So it doesn't get absorbed very well because that's, you know, an ethanol backbone. It's not common, it's, it does get absorbed, but you just have to take more of it. Fish oil can be reestablished into a triglyceride form where they put glycerol back on and that is much better because know the triglyceride is what these, these

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       pancreatic lipase is, are used to seeing so they can absorb it. Your small intestines can absorb it better. So the bioavailability is better essentially. So, but the problem is most fish oil supplements don't do that. There's a, there's a couple of exceptions. I know Nordic naturals is one. Um, I like them. So that's the fish oil. Krill oil is mostly in a phospholipid form. And so that. The thing about the phospholipid form, much like when we were talking about with liposomes is so the thing with phospholipid form is that the, the Dha and EPA and Krill oil can be easily absorbed by the small intestine for one, it can be absorbed and it's intact form without having to undergo all this enzymatic cleavage stuff so it can just be absorbed intact and get transported to the cholesterol at clough microns like hdl ldl that can be transported there in full tax form.

Speaker 4:          02:02:28       Um, but so that's, you know, better bioavailability, so to speak. And there's been a couple of studies showing that there's a 40 percent increase in bioavailability and from getting EPA and Dha in phospholipid form from Krill oil versus getting into a triglyceride form from fish oil. So that's Kinda cool. Um, the, the thing that's really cool about Krill oil is that this phospholipid form, um, is, is great because Dha, to get Dha into the brain, we actually have a transporter, which means you can get the of the brain by just having it as a fatty acid, free fatty acid and it can be carried into the brain. But there's also a specific transporter that has dha in a certain kind of fossil liquid form called phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine is a phospholipid and it isn't Krill oil and it's pretty awesome because the that Dha lysophosphatidylcholine can transport transport's Dha into the brand.

Speaker 4:          02:03:26       It's actually an important way that Dha gets into the brain. In fact, when they knock out that transporter in mice, mice had 60, 60 percent less Dha in their brain. So it's obviously an important pathway. The brain likes it in that form. So I think for for for that reason in and of itself, Krill oil was cool for the Dha because it's in that lie. So phosphatidylcholine form. However, that's not the whole story. I think that a fish oil, because fish oil concentrates the EPA and Dha to insane levels. I mean even though Krill oil is more bioavailable, you know, it doesn't have high levels of EPA or Dha to speak, but your brain doesn't need that much. Dha, your brain conserves Dha very, very well. The half life of Dha is like anywhere between like six months to a year. It's like very, very long.

Speaker 4:          02:04:16       Your brain is conserving it and the brain doesn't take up a lot, so on a daily basis, I think it's something like four milligrams a day, so your brain isn't taking up a whole lot of Dha, but when it does take it up, it likes it in that Krill oil form, that phospholipid form, EPA, EPA is the thing that your brain needs a lot of constant supply and EPA is so important for so many different reasons. We're talking about, you know, that whole neuro inflammatory pathway that we started out talking about with, you know, traumatic brain injury with just normal brain aging with inflammation in general. Anything going on in the body will be any sort of gut issues. All that stuff that's affecting the brain. And so, you know, having EPA in the brain is so important. It's so important. And so I like to get a concentrated amount of EPA from fish oil.

Speaker 4:          02:05:08       I get mine and triglyceride form. So I use Nordic naturals because. So I actually take both. I take Krill oil and I take fish oil because I think the Krill oil is awesome for the Dha in that phosphatidylcholine form and I think that the fish oil, because I can get like I try to get to grams, they've shown like multiple, multiple studies have shown whether I'm looking at cognitive function, whether I'm looking at depression, whether I'm looking at impulsive behavior or other types of brain functions and behaviors to Graham seems to be a consensus in terms of benefits. So that's 2000 milligrams. Yes. Yes. And so I get that from my mind, Nordic naturals EPA that I take. And then I get my Dha from Krill oil. Um, the other thing about the Krill oil is it has asked, is dampen, which is a crock annoyed that is, I'm also accumulates in the rods and cones in the eye and also in the brain.

Speaker 4:          02:05:59       And the reason it does that is because it has a unique structure that is able to sequester singlet oxygen which is produced by UV light. The Sun singlet oxygen is the thing that damages our eyes with age. It's very real. It's one of those reactive oxygen species that I talk about and it damages the rods and the cones of the eye and it's a, it's a cause of, you know, age related blindness, whether we're talking about macular degeneration, degeneration or other sorts of, you know, uh, I dibella attaining diseases, so I'm asked is anthon, Lutein, zeaxanthin. These are carotinoids that are really, really good. And they accumulate in the eye because they're like basically every time we're out in the sun and that blue light hits which caused, which has the elect, the singlet oxygen in it, it captures it and it stops it from damaging brain and also eyes.

Speaker 4:          02:06:48       So acids, anthony is really cool. It's also been shown in clinical studies to, you know, improve hdl to have know lower oxidation locks at lower oxidative stress. All these good sorts of goodies that come along with it, which I also think are really cool. I like and um, in terms of rancidity, I personally, the reason, another reason why I take Nordic naturals is because of the isolate their fish oil under nitrogen conditions, meaning there's no oxygen oxygen present. So in order for these Omega threes to get damaged, they need to be oxidized. So part of the whole distillation process, the pilling, all that stuff, you're, you're exposing it to oxidative damage. And so the fact that Nordic naturals does all that in a nitrogen conditioning, there's no oxygen present. So it's kind of awesome. Now, the Krill oil rancidity, uh, I wasn't aware of how

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       rents rancid it gets just because I'm sort of new to the Krill oil field. I just did a lot of reading on this Dha phosphatidylcholine form. It's probably a similar situation, right? Probably is. Xanthan is a very good at it. It's also good at preventing lipid peroxidation. So it's, you know, it's doing some good students. It's an antioxidant, it's preventing a lot of that rancidity just a matter of maybe how much as Stanton's in there. That's possible. I've seen various doses, so maybe more acid antin would help prevent the rancidity uh, in that, in that regard. But, um, that would be one thing that I would look for if you're getting. The Cro will try to get a higher level thinking of macular degeneration and our issues. What, what specifically is a good thing to take for vision? I've heard core sutton. Is that what it's Quercitin yeah, of course.

Speaker 1:          02:08:28       It's supposed to promote healthy vision. Even better than that is Lutein and Zeaxanthin leading the team as well. This sort of thing. There's this pure has a macular health packet or some supplements they saved that has both that loot. That's, you say Ludy and Lutein, looting, Z Z is absent 10. Yeah, I'm not, I'm not. I mean that's course attendance. Just got generalized mechanisms where it activates NRF two, which is a transcription factor that activates glutathione. So it's, you know, it's one of those broad spectrum kind of like the curcumin where it turns on a lot of good good genes in the body. Um, but really if we're talking about the idea, ha, Lutein and Zeaxanthin, uh, the, they're really the main ones and moving into Xanthan are present in like green plants is really high in it. Um, Zucchini, you know, these things that it has all those things is a pure one.

Speaker 1:          02:09:26       The one that I'd say has, um, has looting, it has a zs, a in the course attend as well as well as a and Siedel l sighting and inositol assisting cystine. Is that what it says? Yes. Yeah. So actually that's another inositol sustain is another way that you can activate nrf two and also glutathione and it's also a potent antioxidant. Um, you know, I don't know it. It's not like a general thing that's specific to the eye. It's more of a, sorry, not a specific thing to the eye. It's more of a general thing. It can induce glutathione synthesis, so it's, you know, it's one of those things that are good for multiple cells, but especially when I'm, if we're just talking about the eye lutein and Zeaxanthin, like if you look in other tissues, the only place you find it is in the eye and the rods and the cones in the eye and in the brain.

Speaker 1:          02:10:23       That's it. That's where it accumulates. Whereas n-acetyl NSU assisting gets in like multiple cells. It's just doing a general antioxidant thing. So having the Lutein and Suzanne and that's part of the. I think this, I make a smoothie every morning, which has a lot of Kale in it and other Greens, but it's got a high concentration of Lutein and Zeaxanthin. Also, my multivitamin has it as well. I think I'm confusing corset in with something else because I think it was looting there was thinking about, because I don't even think this pure mentor, probably what you were thinking about looting his course it into something else. Right. It's a polyphenol. Yeah, it's good. I mean it does a lot of good things. You know that a lot of the mechanisms by which these polyphenols work is through that, it's slightly toxic. It activates all these different genes in our tissues that are detoxifying enzymes like with Ioan and other reactive oxygen species, scavengers and things like that.

Speaker 1:          02:11:19       So inositol sustaining has been shown to activate all the glutathione genes so those, you know, it's, it's a, it's one of those mechanisms where it's like, it, it, like I mentioned before, the hormetic response. It's kind of like that where it does something like that generalizing response. You talked earlier about something that I always thought it was bullshit that, um, the, the, the, the herbal shit that everybody always prescribed when people are sick at conation. I always thought it was nonsense. I don't, I don't know if it is or not. I just, I mentioned it because I know that it's in people's minds. It's an herbal thing that people going to take a couple of jobs of recognition when you're on it and never did anything. I never felt any increased, uh, you know, healing or recovery from colds. I honestly have no idea if it's, if it's real or not because I haven't read about it enough.

Speaker 1:          02:12:11       I mean, I think the best thing to do, like we were talking about, you know, is making sure you don't have a lot of inflammation going on. Making sure you're healthy. Like that's gonna be the way to have the best immune response you can possibly have when you are exposed to something pathogenic. It's fascinating the way human beings work because we always go to try to fix it once it's broken and don't try to prevent it from being fixed. Like there's a, there's a lot of money. Well, there's a lot of money in health supplements, but there's a lot of money and like homeopathic remedies once you're already sick. Like I remember, I don't remember who gave it to me, but I remember there's this stuff, it's like these little, like little sugar capsules there. You pop the top and put in your mouth. I'm like, I'm eating sugar.

Speaker 1:          02:12:57       Was it? Homeopathy is nonsense. No, no, no. This is amazing. Homeopathic remedy for Kohl's. I go, this is fucking sugar sugar effect. Is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah, I think that. Is that stuff called, you know what I'm talking about? No, you pop the top of it. It's like sugar crystals now. I've never, I have no idea what you're talking about. But I do know that homeopathic stuff is, there's just no way that can be effective. The way that diluted to the point where there's like one molecule of the compound in. It's just crazy. Um, I did, I was given, given that once, and I took one I didn't know was homeopathic, but I thought it was like Arnica or something. And I took it, but it was like little tiny little cap, like sugar things inside of it. And I could tell just by the way I shook the capsule, I didn't, I didn't pop it open.

Speaker 1:          02:13:42       Maybe I was supposed to, I don't know, I just took the capsule. But anyways, that that's when his Arnica Arnica is, um, it's, it's anti inflammatory or anti microbial mean. It's used for like mouthwash kind of thing. It's, it's potent at inhibiting. I'm aerobic bacteria. Bacteria that are aerobic. So, so that's, you know, I haven't done a ton of research on the, but it's the one thing that it does do golden rule is another one that's always partnered with Achalasia gold. Golden Seal. Golden. That's right. No, you're right. You're, you're bringing back memories from like, I don't know because I just haven't looked into those. I haven't been. I know the things that are good are the polyphenols course to 10 in Kerman Turmeric in general because of the tomorrow. And I'm the inositol assisting in Alpha lipoic acid is another way to increase glutathione. That's also impart important for mitochondrial function.

Speaker 1:          02:14:42       So, you know, there are, there are good things and who knows some of these. Yeah, Alpha lipoic acid is interesting because, um, my actually my mentor, he is one of the pioneers that showed when you give alpha lipoic acid to old rats showed this like, I don't know, 15 years ago, I guess it made them young again, like their brain, like made their brains young. So when you gave them to old rats, it was reversing aging. How do they administer? It was an intravenous. Oh, you know, I don't remember. I don't remember if it was intravenous or not. I can easily check that, check that out. But Alpha lipoic acid does get absorbed. It actually gets absorbed better when it's not taken with protein, interestingly enough, because it binds. Usually it's something we make ourselves, like plants make it, it's in, it's in food that we eat and it's also, you know, we have, we make it in our body, um, but it, when it's complex to protein for some reason.

Speaker 1:          02:15:41       And I don't, it's been so long. It's been quite a few years since I read about this mechanism. But something about it, um, does it doesn't get absorbed because it's like getting cleaved away or something with the protein. So actually taking Alpha lipoic acid supplement should be taken on an empty stomach. I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah. No. Which is kind of different than other foods where you take them with morphine or how many people like listen to all this information and there's a lot of people listening this podcast right now, like fuck, there's too much to really take into consideration. There's too much. Like, okay, I need some of that, but I don't want protein. Okay. What do I take it? Okay. Light bulbs, Somo, gludethyon. Is that legit or do I need a lot of fun? Okay. So I'll take turmeric and then I'll get my, the same thing

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       that I would get from people on the subway right now, writing on their hands, trying to put all the shit in their head. How much stuff should you take a day? And how much of this can you get from your food? Can you get this free food? Yeah, absolutely. Like there's apple podcasts and your food when you're cooking. What kind of foods? I think, you know, I think that it's, you know, Joe, it's been so long I can't, I can't recall which ones have the, most of it. It's in a lot of foods, but in terms of concentration wise, I forgot. But the thing is, is that, you know, like I'll take alpha lipoic acid. It's not part of my staple, you know, my, what I really, really focused on is on micronutrients that are part of all these biochemical pathways that are going on in all of ourselves, including our brain.

Speaker 4:          02:17:16       Those things I want to make sure I'm getting. That's key. So getting the Omega threes, getting my EPA, Dha, getting vitamin D, magnesium, getting all my minerals, calcium, magnesium, getting that right, making sure I get all that stuff. Vitamin C, like all I need all those micronutrients and I want to make sure I get that. That's most important. Um, the other stuff, you know, like the taking the current curcumin or turmeric and I'm glad with my own things like that, you know, those are more, I think other measures that you can, I think first and foremost, healthy diet, you know, making sure you're eliminating the inflammation at the source of it, which is, you know, making sure you're not causing too much inflammation by eating, eating sugar and refined crap. Just eat. You want to make sure you're eating a lot of micronutrients, eating your meats that are not all crazy a processed.

Speaker 4:          02:18:09       Yeah. And nitrites and nitrates night. Well, nitrates aren't used for um, you know, they're in, they're in, they're an all plant later, like everywhere in nature. Um, nitrites are used to cure me and like lunch meats and bake a lot of bacon, I think has it. Um, the difference is that I try, it's can form a nature, a nitrosamines which are potent carcinogens. So they basically what they do is they bind to your DNA and they formed this bolt, bulky adduct on your DNA. And what happens is when your cell tries to replicate, so that's DNA damage, a bulky addicts and I trusted means they like interact with DNA and then when the cell replicates, like the, the, the replication machinery, you can't recognize that DNA sequence because there's a big thing sitting there and so it just puts anything there and it's actually associated with a specific type of mutation.

Speaker 4:          02:19:08       I think it's a Gett one. It's been a while. But, um, that causes, that's associated with cancer, which is why it's labeled as a carcinogen. Um, so nitrites can form that. Um, mostly because they're in, when they're in an accurate, accurate solution, they conform nitrous acid which then can react with amiens which are everywhere. And proteins like amino acids, like ambience. So that reacted to, that, informed them, conform on, I trusted me. So that's not a good thing. And nitrates, you can form. Nitrates can form nitrites, like in the saliva, we have bacteria in our saliva that can do that. And I've seen studies everywhere and anywhere ranging from like five, five to 20 percent or something like that where it can form. Nitrates are starting nitrites and nitrates conform, so eating lots of plants to inform which get into your system, but a significant amount can be toxic.

Speaker 4:          02:20:05       Well, um, so while there is, I don't remember what the toxicity, I think that there is something that can happen, but so there's a, there's a nitrates conform nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator. It's, you know, it's kind of a good thing and actually they use, sometimes they use that to help people with hypertension. Um, and I tried to, can also form that, but it depends on whether or not there's enough antioxidant around like vitamin C or other antioxidants because nitrites, because they'd be formed this nitrous acid acid in acquia solution, they can immediately then go into nitrogen means, but if you have this reducing agent around, then you can shift them nitrites to form night nitris nitric oxide. Uh, but so plants, right, which is good, but so plants have a lot of vitamin C when you're eating the nitrates in the plants, you're getting vitamin C, you're getting all these antioxidants, vitamin CS and Kale, celery, all that stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:21:03       It's there. So you don't, they've done studies where they've looked at the amount of nitrogen means formed from either nitrites or nitrates and like so for meat like meat, nitrates that are cured meat and they've shown that nitrates don't form those as readily because it's warming the nitric oxide instead, especially because there's a lot of vitamin C around which inhibits the formation of the nitrogen mean if you, if you take the nitrites and the cured me, then you're not getting a lot of antioxidants unless you're eating them also with it. Uh, but in the case where you're cooking the nitrites cooking is dangerous because can be dangerous because when you cook water, you know, water is, have you get water and the nitrites in, in accurate solution and water form nitrogen form nitric acid which then react with the degradation products of amino acids from like Bacon for example, like has protein and they formed trust in me. And so cooking conformed the Nitros the means and you can ingest them. So cured bacon with, with chemicals is what's bad for you. I don't, I'm not a big fan of, of eating nitrites daily or even weekly. Um, you know that I think if you love Bacon, why not just buy the stuff without the nitrites? They make it without it. You can get to the butcher shop where it's not. Right. I think I've even seen it like at Berkeley Bowl, like we're, we're a shop so it's not so are bad and I traits

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       or plant formed and nitrates can form my truck. It's just, I know it was like a little confusing and complicated, but commonly misconstrued commonly. Yeah. They commonly get. Yes. So yeah, nine traits are not what are curing meat. Nitrates are Woodson plants and you can form them. You can form nitrites from them. However, because of all the vitamin C and all that, they don't readily form. They chose the meetings I trust that means which is the bad stuff, that it's the carcinogen. That's, that's what you don't want to form. It forms nitric oxide more readily so and nitrites can form nitric oxide, but they also form nitrogen means. And particularly if there's not a lot of vitamin C, your antioxidants around, they can get pushed towards that. And I trust him. Can State. Yeah, Uber complicated. It's so complicated. I've seen the switched. I'm all over the place on the Internet actually.

Speaker 1:          02:23:18       So I know a lot about it because my mentor studied nitrospan means and he was like one of the pioneering guys that like was talking about how this DNA damage causes cancer. So I've, he's told me about them, you know, so I know a little bit, a little bit about them and he knows a lot more than it. So it just seems like one of those things where when you're, when you're talking about all these different nutrients and you talking about this is a real constant area of study for anybody who wants to be consistently healthy. Anybody who really wants to have a really nutritionally balanced diet and optimize their health and their potential to recover from illness and prevent certain, you know, certain damage and free radicals and all the areas that could be problematic in our world and our diets. This just so much to think about.

Speaker 1:          02:24:10       There's so much to calculate. I, yeah, I think that, um, one of the main things I think that my advice would be, it's a lot easier to focus on what you should eat then on what you shouldn't. And I think that in more inclusionary diet is, is key. So focusing on what your body needs, you know, not only for short term but what it needs for longterm. Focus on that more than focus on what you're eliminated from your diet because it's just, first of all, if you focus on what your limiting from your diet, then you're not going to be getting all the good stuff that you need. That's a lot about loss. You're also thinking if you need that, it's just like it's so there's too many little. It's easy to become caught up in a lot of my new show and I know this because I've been there.

Speaker 1:          02:24:58       And so, you know, getting caught up in all this little minutia, you know, it can take you forever to try to figure out what's going on. And then in the meantime, you're getting distracted from the important thing is not as what you need. You know your body, your body is very resilient, and if you feed it what it needs, you can fight off stuff. You're, you're gonna, you're gonna age better. You know all these little chemical reactions and enzymatic reactions going on in all your cells, in your liver and your kidney and your brain. All these things, they're going to keep happening because you're feeding it. And when you have a little bit of toxic stuff, guess what? All of these pathways are ready because they're so they're getting nourished, are getting what they need that they activate in the. Your body has protective mechanisms to make sure it doesn't get cancer.

Speaker 1:          02:25:38       And you know, I explained that when you make reactive oxygen species, you can repair it or you can see the cell will die. But all those, all those repairs, a stress response mechanisms, they require that you know, you're, you're giving yourselves what they need to do that. So if you're so focused on what not to eat that you're not getting enough of what you need, then your body is, you know, capacity to do that isn't gonna be as optimal. So I really like, I really think it's easier, especially for people that don't have a scientific background that don't have time. I mean because it takes a lot of time to sit there and read through all the scientific studies and figure out what's going on, all the complex interactions, you know, I barely have time to do that and it's like I do this every day.

Speaker 1:          02:26:21       Like I do research every day and on top of that in my spare time I do. And it's still overwhelming and I still can only get so much done. And you have the education to deal with all the information and you understand what's going on and the mechanisms behind it. Yeah. Well, you know, last time we were here we talked about some of the dis information that even medical professionals, guys who've written books that without an understanding of the different, like we talked about vitamin e and the, the understanding of the different mechanisms involved in vitamin D, absorption in the body and people who have written books that are incorrect about the, what's negative about high levels and what is good about high levels and what is, you know, what, how your body should be processing it and what different types of vitamin either is just so there's so many variables.

Speaker 1:          02:27:12       There's so much going on. Uh, yeah, I think that in addition to so many variables and it being so complex where we're also continually finding out new things, you know, I'm talking about studies that were published two months ago in the context of traumatic brain injury in some of these neural stem cells. I mean, it takes a continual searching of the literature, you know, to, to keep up to date with all the new research. And, and that's incredibly difficult to do when you're occupied full time. As for example, as a physician and you're treating patients already overworked, you know, these are things, it's, it's extremely difficult for a lot of physicians. First of all, they haven't been trained in a lot of these biochemical pathways in nutrition and mechanisms. I think that the training itself inherently it's flawed. Um, and that's something that needs to be changed at the institutional level.

Speaker 1:          02:28:06       You know, I think that doctors need to be, there needs to be more of a focus on understanding how nutrition interacts with genes, how diet interacts with genes, how these complex biochemical pathways, why they, why they need all these different micronutrients as cofactors, make enzymes work and all this stuff that's not, that's, that's lacking in the medical profession. I know that talking [inaudible] I have several friends that are physicians have told me and also because, you know, even people that aren't my friends that are physicians have told me that they don't get trained in this way. Um, so I think that's really, you know, that's one of the flaws in medicine, but in addition to that, you have doctors that work really hard. You know, and I, I respect them, I think that they do to some degree, you know, they, they, they train hard, they work hard and they try, they're trying to somehow help people.

Speaker 1:          02:28:56       They're trying to diagnose diseases and um, to some degree that, you know, they do do that. But um, I think the problem is that they also can't keep up with all the new literature that can't keep up with the new research. And then there's the whole human component that comes in when you got your patient that knows more about something than you do. Sometimes ego gets in the way and your immediate response is sort of a jerk knee response where it's like, no, this can't be true because I'm the leader. I'm the person that knows this. And especially when you're talking about things like you were talking about the study with the mice, the showing that the, the neurons or actually it's stimulating the stem cell growth that this is all so new and you're talking about something that's like a couple months old. If your, your degree was in the nineties, good fucking luck.

Speaker 1:          02:29:43       No, it's true. It's, you know, it's, you know, I do like for me, I, I'm putting out some of these videos and I do this, you know, I'm sort of, I'm trying to do it more frequently, but some of my videos are a little more complex than like the general, you know, educational video. Like I try to really be comprehensive and bring it home and sort of, you know, make sure I explained mechanism and context and all those things and I've been getting emails from positions that are thanking me because they're saying they never knew this and they don't have time. And it's really rewarding in addition to like educating the public, you know, like I think that's also very important and making sure the public people that, you know, understanding how to prevent disease, understanding what you need to try to optimally optimally perform is as good as you can now and to age as best as you can.

Speaker 1:          02:30:32       That's important. But it's also important for physicians to understand the things that they didn't get. They didn't get trained in and they don't have time to read about. It's almost impossible if you have a full practice and you're constantly training people on a daily basis and exactly how much education is involved in getting a degree in nutrition. Well, I mean when you, even if you're a doctor, if your general practitioner, how much of your time is really spent learning about nutrition and when you go to a doctor for advice but nutrition, you're almost better off just fucking googling it. Yeah. I don't know how much time. I think that relatively speaking to the rest of their training, I would say it's not much. Um, and you know, also getting into new degree in nutrition is also.

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       I mean, like I, I got a degree in biomedical science and I'm, you know, I've, I've done research on aging cancer and now I'm doing some nutrition research, but I think that even getting a degree in nutrition has flaws because, you know, I think that some of these, some of the dogma with nutrition itself is been changing with new science and then getting people to like change their state of mind. I mean, that's always harder to do, especially when they've been spewing this out for years and uh, and also that a lot of, you know, degrees in nutrition, you know, like they don't have a real hardcore science in some cases like a science background where it's like, I always liked, I like to change fields. I'm changing my, I've changed my field several times, you know, I've started out doing chemistry, looking at the very, very molecular level and then I went into aging research and then cancer and now I'm doing nutrition and now I'm getting, now I'm even getting into the brain. So I think that it's Kinda cool to also have different perspectives like where it's like because you see things that other people had been in that field forever don't see, you know, like, you know, the neural stem cells and there's not a lot of nutrition people talking about neural stem cells and things nutrition that are important for that. So it's, yeah, it's definitely, it's hard for the, for the average person to figure out what they should eat or what they should supplement. I know that you were saying

Speaker 3:          02:32:49       one of the companies that you're involved with does like nutritional scans on people. You'll do like a blood work panel and then recommend what the person is deficient in.

Speaker 4:          02:32:59       Yeah, so I'm not involved with them. I had done some. I've done a couple of guest blog post. I'm a little over a year ago to sort of a because I liked what they were doing. Basically. I like the service. They companies with wellness. Fx wellness effects is cool because they. They are they, they're basically consumer based where it's like you sort of, you don't have to go get a doctor's prescription to go get your blood work and to look at things like c reactive protein, your vitamin D levels, you know, your rbc, magnesium, your lipid profile, you know, these sorts of things. Omega three they do. They measure ea at EPA and Dha and they also measured the Omega three to Omega six ratio, which is also important. I mean having too much of omega six fatty acids also leads to that inflammation, that generation of Youtube series, prostoglandins and the brain and the body. It's causing inflammation in, so having a, having a good omega six to Omega three ratio is also really good. Um, so they do that as well and I think that people that are going to get these tests done and then they get their blood work and then they, you know, they'll wellness fx has like a panel of nutritionists and other physicians I'm not really familiar with. They help people interpret and to what degree they know what they're doing. I can't tell you, but the point is,

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       is that you have that information. You can, you can also learn a lot from the internet, but also you can, uh, look at your baseline and make dietary changes and start to see how things change. Like that's really important. You know, this quantifying this quantified self movement, it's called where you're basically quantifying your own thing, you know, blood work and things like that, and figuring out how to optimize yourself. That's a lot of work. It seems like it'd be really problematic to find a lot of Rhonda Patrick's out there though. I don't know how many of you there are. I'm not blowing smoke up your ass because you're my friend and I love you, but if there was 100 Rhonda Patrick's out there running clinics, who will be awesome. That means 100 cities could have a place where you could go and you could get someone who's really completely absorbed in this sort of research like you are, give you a real systematic breakdown of your diet.

Speaker 1:          02:35:10       Here's your profile. This is what you're missing is. This is fucking difficult. Chip. Well thank you for that compliment. But I, um, I think that, you know, getting the blood work done and looking at these different micronutrients and biomarkers and liberal panel lipid panels is one aspect of it. And I think the other aspect that I'm becoming increasingly interested in is getting the genetic data as well, like 23 and me. So I, you know, I'm, you know, I'm trying to figure out a way somehow I can. I'm getting more and more interested in because I'm looking a lot at these complex interaction between genes and diet and I'm trying to figure out, okay, you have this polymorphism. You being me, I have it. Apo e four, what do I do to make sure that I can give myself the best chance of not getting Alzheimer's disease, excuse me, what can I do for my father who is 65 years old now?

Speaker 1:          02:36:02       And it's at a critical point. I got to make sure that if I don't somehow intervene now and make sure he's doing things right, that he's going to get Alzheimer's and I probably want that even. I want to make sure he doesn't get it even more than idea probably because you know, when you have it, it's, I feel bad for all my family members, you know, but I won't really know. It's, it's, it's dealing with your close loved ones and then completely losing their mind and not remembering who you are. I can't think of a worse thing that can happen, you know, except from death. Watched bunch of documentaries on people with Alzheimer's and it's brutal. And like I said, I've seen the traumatic brain version of it in fighters slowly start to appear. And uh, not just in real time but in the highly accelerated real time.

Speaker 1:          02:36:47       Like I've seen a guy go from being one way, two to three fights later, I see them a year later and he's a different guy and this is fairly common. I see this. You can literally see the struggle in their eyes. Wow. See the struggle in the way they formed sentences. Some of the. I talked about some things that are possible to help you know, people that are getting traumatic brain injury, repetitive traumatic brain injury and obviously I really, I really think that the Aicpa we for genetic test is. I would love to see that come into practice where we're talking adopted by athletic commissions. I'd like to see that adopted. Yes. I'd like to see it adopted by NFL. I'd like to see boxing, mma. I'd like to see all those types of athletic commissions adopted where it's like, you know, I don't want to say, okay, well they're going to say your April before you can't do that because I hate to like take that away from someone, you know.

Speaker 1:          02:37:44       I don't know. Maybe maybe, maybe people will figure it out and there's some committee formed and they'll say, you know what? It's such a high risk that we aren't just can't. Have you been a hemophiliac sword fight? It is. It really is. It's just that bad. I mean you're talking about going from just having that a Lele I'm already freaked out because I've got a two to three fold risk of Alzheimer's disease and you're talking about going from that to attend in some cases, you know, 10, 15 fold increase risk and and not only increased risk, it's an earlier onset. It, it changes the onset like by seven years. So you're talking about getting it 17 years, almost a decade earlier than other people. So that Aaliyah like having that isoform and it's just an easy, it's an easy test to do. Twenty three and me does it and doctors do it as well.

Speaker 1:          02:38:33       No. There was a really a recent study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease that reported neuroscientists using a cellular model of the Alzheimer's, found low doses of Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol, which is thc from marijuana actually has been shown to reduce the production of amyloid Beta and prevented abnormal accumulation, which is some of the early signs of memory loss, which is hilarious because marijuana has been known to give people short term memory loss. I mean, that's the one thing that pot heads like myself constantly complaining about the fuck was I just talking about you, what would, only when they're on it, but when you were smoking marijuana or eating it when you were intoxicated by it. The big thing is short term memory loss. So it's interesting that you bring this up because in my whole traumatic brain injury quest, as I've been reading about, you know, recently, um, cannabinoids came up on my radio radar because new studies have just recently come out related to als to also traumatic brain injury where they found, for example, that patients that were admitted to the hospital after a traumatic brain injury, I think it was like a mild to mild to moderate.

Speaker 1:          02:39:52       So it was like Glasgow Coma score of four or five. It wasn't like a severe, severe, like totally like, you know, in a coma and all that. But they found that those people that were admitted after having a traumatic brain injury, they, those that had the highest levels of thc in their blood were the least likely to die. And it was like

Speaker 4:          02:40:13       there was a dose dependent thing where they saw people that had higher levels were much less likely to die in the hospital. So that sort of sparked my interest in like, what's going on. I did a short little research and I found out that also, even in mice mice that were given a low dose of thc that was not high enough to have a psychotropic effect. Um, it actually, so they gave mice this low dose, just a single low dose of thc either 48 hours before the traumatic injury. So they induced traumatic injury in the mice when they typically press put pressure on their little tiny mouse skulls and, or they gave it to them one to seven days after the traumatic event had occurred. And what they found was that it dramatically reduced the whole neuro inflammatory pathway. There was less edema, there was less inflammation, less amyloid plaques were aggregated.

Speaker 4:          02:41:11       So this is quite significant. Um, so I started reading just a little bit more. I haven't done a ton of reading on this topic, so I really am no expert by any means. So apparently there's two different receptors. Cannabinoid receptors in the brain, there's a CB one and CB two, CB one is found on neurons predominantly in cb two is found on the Microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain, which is really interesting because they're also found in the immune cells in the body. So it's like somebody about the CB two receptor is specific to immune cells, whether we're talking about immune cells in the brain or in the periphery. But what's interesting is that cannabinoid activation of the CB two receptors in the Microglia, it prevents them from getting activated and prevents them from throwing out all sorts of cytokines and causing all sorts of neuroinflammatory cycles that happen.

Speaker 4:          02:42:04       I don't know exactly how I think that it's. I think it's also well known that cannabinoids have some sort of anti inflammatory effect in general. Um, so that is one likely mechanism. And the other thing was the CB one receptors. So they recently found this led me into this Alzheimer's. There was studies. So the fact that it can protect from traumatic brain injury is, and it's that it's an anti inflammatory effect, is also is showing that this is relevant for Alzheimer's. So when I did a search on that, sure enough, yes, it's like lots of studies actually had been done on the effects of cannabinoids on Alzheimer's. And so, um, there was a recent study that showed that somehow the, the receptor, when you agonize the receptor cb one receptor on neurons, it's, um, protects, it does something where it's important for longterm potentiation and it's kind of a confusing mechanism, but longterm potentiation is when you have.

Speaker 4:          02:43:01       So during learning the learning process, when you're learning something new and you form, you've got a synopsis forming between the neurons and there's an enhancement in that, a signal. So it's like it's enhanced. So it's solidifying that memory, that learning, whatever you're learning, it's making it stronger. And that's a very important mechanism for like neuroplasticity. So making sure that you're going to remember something longterm, you know, because you've enhanced that signal, it's going to be there. And to do that enhanced that a longterm potentiation you can activate, you can cause, you know, more like activating types of signals, but you also get rid of the inhibitory ones and the CB one receptor seems to somehow get rid of those inhibitory ones when it's activated. And amyloid Beta plaques, when they build up in the brain, they, they act, they antagonized CB One receptor. They prevent the CB one receptor from doing that role.

Speaker 4:          02:43:58       It does in longterm potential potentiation, which is part of the, the effects on memory long term memory to um. Now in terms of short term memory, I don't really know. It's kind of interesting because I had the same thoughts I've heard that, you know, will short term memory's affected. It's very stereotypical when you talk to anyone on the street, they've heard that 100 percent, but I don't know that I would have to read a lot more on this topic, but there may be some sort of acute versus chronic effect where it's like there's something happening acutely while you're, you know, agonizing them while you're, while you're taking the cannabinoids and then versus the longterm effect. And maybe there's some sort of trade off, maybe it's like short term, some things affected, but in the longterm, your, your, your ability to have that longterm potentiation is good. Um, so it's, it's interesting the cannabinoid. It's unfortunate that there's not a lot of research being done in that field. I think that more and more people are doing more research on it. As all these studies are coming out, you just can't ignore it.

Speaker 3:          02:45:00       It's absolutely happening more and more. Especially now that there's money involved in it because of what's going on in Colorado and Washington state. There's so much money that's being poured into marijuana research now because people are starting to look at it in terms of, well this is some seriously financially viable stuff like this is not just like some sort of a fringe thing that people trying to sneak in under the guise of medicine. This is a crop and we have to look at it as this is a commodity. I mean, they're making hundreds of millions of dollars now in taxes. These states are, Colorado is going to be over $100, million dollars here. Washington state might surpass it and once all is said and done, I mean it's gonna be crazy. And once the new elections start rolling in and these, these, uh, options were on the ballot for other states, there's a lot of states that are economically challenged that are going to probably jump aboard and in California should be an barest that they have.

Speaker 3:          02:45:56       And especially with fucking Moonbeam Jerry Brown in Sacramento, the whole thing is ridiculous. It should have been illegal a long, long, long time ago. But, um, I think that there's going to be a lot more studies being done on positive effects because they're just, they've looked at so many different things. The reduction of interocular pressure for people that have glaucoma, people have wasting disease and aids and all sorts of people have a appetite issues because of chemotherapy. I mean, you can go on and on and on, but now when you're fighting all termers the anti-inflammation properties of it, um, especially the differences between eating it and smoking it, you give, you get more benefits from eating it. A lot of people that complain about chronic pain or hugely, uh, they find it hugely beneficial. I mean, it's a really good plan. Yeah. That's, um, I think you're right, as, as more and more research comes out, there's going to be a positive feedback loop where it's like you test and in addition with all these other progressive states like Colorado and Washington state, which are now, you know, it's recreational, recreationally legal, and it's not only that it's generating income, which is like, you just can't ignore that.

Speaker 3:          02:47:04       I mean, that's money. The money's too big at this point and people have a hard time ignoring money. Well, it'd be really hard for them to take it away now because what happens is the states get addicted to that tax revenue when you're talking about withdrawing $100,000,000 in tax revenue when the statistics, here's where it gets really crazy decrease in violent crime, decrease in Dui arrests and over and over and over, there's like, no, there's no negatives. There's like a. God jumped off a roof somewhere like, okay, that fucking guy might've jumped off a roof anywhere. That's terrible. Terrible, terrible. High driving, even if you get in an accident, you go into miles and hour. Everybody's just bumping into each other. It's really relaxed, hydrating accidents. I mean, we're talking about traumatic brain injury. I mean getting hit by a drunk driver. I mean you're talking about.

Speaker 3:          02:47:51       It's awful. It's just amazing. Really, truly amazing how few drunk driving accidents there are in comparison to how frequent the places where you can get alcohol or as you're driving down the street, if you drive down the street and the street, you drive down, you have drug dealers all over the place. Every restaurant you pass a drug dealer. Every cvs store is a drug dealer. I mean, they're all selling trucks. They're all selling alcohol. I mean, almost every bar. I mean, of course every bar, but almost every restaurant, almost every drug store, they're all selling alcohol. I mean, it's incredible. The availability of alcohol and if you take that into consideration, it's incredible how few alcohol related accidents we really do have. What's interesting is that they're selling this drug that alcohol. It does. It does a lot of damage. Alcohol does damage to your gut. I mean, you're talking about poking holes in your gut like sugar does, it does that. It also obviously your liver, that's what most people are familiar with, but the brain is my concern, you know, particularly because I can't repair damage as efficiently as my husband who has, doesn't have this apl we for, um, so when you drink and they've even shown in studies, people with April before illegal that drink alcohol even increase their risk of Alzheimer's even

Speaker 4:          02:49:08       more because what, you know, when you're, when you're talking about inducing cell death, then if you can't replenish that, you know, cell death, if you can't repair that damage and April we for can't. When you have that Apl we afford it, impairs the ability to grow new, like I said, grow new neurons and repair damage. And that's very important. Um, it also, it's so bad because it's also causing more aggregation of amyloid Beta and all that. So that's the neurons are prime to die. And when you had alcohol on top of that, it's causing a tipping them over to death. That stress plus stress like I was talking about. So, um, you know, I don't, I don't drink a lot, it's fun and I, and I've always done it, you know, in social situations, but after finding out about my April before every time I am an associate social situation, if I'm having a dinner with them, a bunch of friends and they give me a glass of wine and even though there's some benefits with polyphenols and the wine resveratrol and one.

Speaker 4:          02:50:05       Yeah, Rivera trials one, um, and, but the problem is, is that I, the, the, the, it's like the pros and cons. The cons outweigh the benefits in my mind because alcohol does so much damage that I can't repair. So if you and I are drinking a glass of wine, you know, let's, let's just assume that you're, you don't have this April before because one in four people have it. There's three people in this room. It's likely that neither of us, Mike, I'm the one me, you know, so, but you know, what I'm saying is that, you know, I have to think about this interaction between the genes and the Diet and me drinking the alcohol. Now I know that I can't repair that damage as efficiently, so it's like it changes, it changes my, my future behavior and incense and some people would probably say, Whoa, you're not going to enjoy life.

Speaker 4:          02:50:51       And you know, it's like I'm not saying I don't ever drink and I do a lot of other really, really good things to counteract that, counteract that. And I'm trying to figure out more good things. But I think that knowing that, like for example, exercise exercise also, you know, it was very, very important for people with April before and they've shown this in studies that people that exercise more, um, that have an April before Lele are less likely to get it to get Alzheimer's. So this is where this complex interaction between genes and environment come into play. But it's interesting that cannabinoids which are not found in every cvs store, any store, like within a block radius, I'm actually have the opposite effect on the brain. And they actually help repair the damage. They actually decreased the inflammation. Um, you know, it makes people like me who are very hyper aware of this Alzheimer's disease.

Speaker 4:          02:51:40       And all the mechanisms that are accelerating it and how to stave it off, it makes me think, well, that's kind of interesting that something that's seems to be beneficial from our, from our studies that we've had published so far. Um, you know, so when will we see that adopted in the medical community? You know, are we going to see changes? Are we going to start to see people given cannabinoids? And, you know, I don't know if they're trying to figure out a way to uncouple the psychotropic effects from the anti inflammatory effects. I'm almost certain that people are trying to figure that out. And I don't know if that's gonna work or not. You know, there may be something about the psychotropic effect of it that's also important for, you know, there's, there's no telling biology. I mean, it's, it's the way it is for a reason, you know.

Speaker 4:          02:52:22       Um, but, uh, it's, it's something that's on my mind. It's on my mind now that I, you know, especially that, that I know I have this April, we for a Lille, which completely changes a lot of, you know, things that I. When I think about exercise, I don't think about exercise in the sense of, Oh, I need to lose weight. I want to stay toned and look good. I think about it. If I don't get exercise, I am dramatically increasing my risk of Alzheimer's disease. If I don't get that exercise, my brain is going to atrophy and I'm going to move more. It's going to be more likely that I'm going to lose my brain function and I'm going to change my behavior in older age. And that is terrifying, terrifying, you know, so, you know, the exercise, it's becoming like, you know, I think people still really think of it, of it in terms of, you know, losing weight and it's just, it's doing so much more.

Speaker 4:          02:53:18       It's doing so much more. And, uh, you know, I'm really glad that people do it to lose weight because at least they're doing it, you know, but they even just like a couple of weeks ago, a study came out showing that exercise literally causes your muscle cells to detoxify something that we made called [inaudible], which is actually a byproduct of Tryptophan metabolism trip to fan, as I've talked about before in our conversations. Can, you know, it was a precursor to Serotonin, right? So tryptophan and has to get into the brain and in order when it gets into the brain and make serotonin. Well, trippy fan can also form something called [inaudible]. And when it forms [inaudible], uh, this happens under conditions of stress or when you're in you, when you, when there's some sort of pathological invader. So it's like, it's an important part of the Immuno Immuno immunological response. So kindness is important to make t regulatory cells.

Speaker 4:          02:54:12       So, I mean, you obviously want to be able to have this response mechanism. However, when you make too much kinder running, not only his trip to fan not being made into Serotonin in the brain because it's getting sucked into this other pathway, in addition, kind uranian can cross the blood brain barrier and it conformed something called quinolinic acid, which is like a neurotoxin. It literally causes too much glutamate to be released and it causes et Cetera, toxicity in cell death, and it activates Microglia so it causes inflammation. If you already have amyloid Beta plaques in your brain, great more activation of Microglia. You're going to keep making more. It's like feeding into that already terrible cycle. So exercise causes muscle cells to like convert that kind urinating into a another byproduct that can't get into the brain. So you're talking about another way that you know, exercise is protecting the brain.

Speaker 4:          02:55:01       In fact, in these study that was published in cell, they found that these mice that they did this in mouse models when they injected the mice with Kenya earning it got into the brain and caused all this neuro toxicity sort of effects, but it also costs depression, caused them to have depression, which of course, you know, inflammation in the brain depletes the ability of the brain to release Serotonin and that's one aspect of how inflammations causing depression. So you're not, you're not making serotonin cause depressive symptoms in these mice, and they do all sorts of little studies where they look at exploratory behavior and all sorts of things in little mice. Obviously humans are way more complex, but then so when they made the mice exercise, the depressive symptoms went away. The neuro toxicity that did better on learning and memory test. So yet another reason why, you know, exercise is freaking awesome for the brain, for depression, for me to make sure I'm not going to get Alzheimer's. So for everybody, for everybody,

Speaker 1:          02:56:03       we're out of time. Unfortunately, we just rattled through three hours at an accelerated rate. Yeah. He just blasted through. Yeah, you were in a trance, you were in a information disseminating trans. Well, I certainly hope people learn stuff. I barely learned. They're going to have to go over it again with a notepad and they're going to google the shit out of it. And, and I think we got a lot out of this to holy shit. Every time we talk, next time we got to talk about cryotherapy is something that I've started getting into my God, we got to talk about that. But God damn this was awesome. Totally awesome. So much. So much cool stuff to talk more about behavioral epigenetics because that's fascinating. Do it again in month or so whenever. Thank you so much. It's always awesome. Your website. Yeah. So uh, found my fitness.com is where you can find me and all my stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:56:54       Found my fitness on twitter, found my fitness on twitter and also I've got a new android APP coming out there this afternoon so you can find it a lunch so you can find it. They're awesome. And also I've got my patrion where I'm now about to make a mile another my first milestone. So I'm pretty stoked about it and um, which means I'm going to have to step up my game and get some more creative works out there for people to listen to. Beautiful. Awesome. You're fantastic. Thank you so much. So it was a pleasure, Rhonda. Patrick, ladies and gentlemen. All right, tomorrow Joe Perry from aerosmith. Hala. See you soon. Bye.
