Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Thin nose anymore. It behooved me. Yeah. Have you ever looked at like a virgo does ears? Yeah. They were big ears and the nose grow. They keep growing. Yeah. Age is a very annoying thing. Well, that's a weird one. It's almost like to let someone know like, Hey, look at this guy's proportions are all fucked up. He's got bad juice. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. So how do I reduce. I wanted to get an ear reduction and a nose sharpening. I'm sure people have done that. I could only imagine if girls are getting will grow. That's a different one. A big ass heroine is here. Hey. Hey. He's not 12 shaved those years. You know, I've, I've got hair growing out of my ears. I have to. I have to put a tremor in vain. I pluck my. Yeah, if I see hair that doesn't belong somewhere I have.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       I'll take it out. Go Wax it. My father like he lets his nose hair grow. Has your eyebrows micro? Would it kill you to. Can you. I'm looking into your nose and stuff. It's a nest father, bro. Yeah, sometimes I get so mad at him because the way he eats sometimes, like we were in Mexico and he uh, he was just show up, you got to breakfast, he has his belly and he's got like, he's got four French toast and a waffle and a banana and I, and I'm just sitting there and I get so mad. And then I started texting him. I texted him, I said, listen man, you got to start changing the way you eat. And I go and I'm angry as I'm texting this, I'm getting more angry, more angry. So stop the bullshit and start eating. No, I was so angry.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       I had to tell them that I'm getting, my heart was beating. I was furious. I couldn't text faster. I go get it together, get it together and stop eating bullshit. And would it kill you to fucking move a little bit? Bang. I just sent that. Oh yeah. Strong. I don't want him to die. Does he exercise at all? Fuck. No. And I'll tell you why. When he was young, he was poor and he had to do manual labor. He had to work construction. He had to do everything with his hands, so now that he has money, it reminds him of one, if you asked him to do shit, if you ask him to help you with a table, it reminds him of when he was poor and how awful it was. I was reading a book once on power lifting. One of the things that they suggested is getting a manual labor job.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       That's when you have to move furniture. Okay. When you got to carry couches upstairs. Yeah. Yeah. That'll never saw that. I never saw anybody actually recommend that someone do that in order to get stronger. Well, when you, um, my friend who we wrestled and played football at a high level, they used to work the farm and they would, there was a thing where you would take hay and you would run after the truck trucks. I'll you take the hay and you throw it off and I guess you'd just doing that. Oh yeah. I mean, you know, you can crazy. I worked construction one summer in, uh, in Washington dc in the 95 degree heat and I had to dig a foundation for a building for a house, just dig into the ground all day and then we had to, we had to demolish a house and take that debris, put it into a truck and then drive it to a landfill called lot and I think and then we would, and we take it off the truck.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       So that movement of digging and then like the demolition and digging and piling it in a truck and then piling it off a truck. You're too exhausted to do a goddamn thing. You're not working out after that. If you do work out and you get used to it though, I think that's the idea is that your body becomes way more resilient. That's what he was saying. If you could get a job because a mason or some sort of manual labor on a construction site. We carrying lumber. You just lifting things up. Karen Reynolds have your body will just naturally gets stronger. The strongest I've ever felt in my life. And Jujitsu was a Mexican guy who was amazing. Oh yeah, man. I couldn't move. Rick's man. I couldn't believe how. How has nothing worked on them. Just imagine like picking up bricks all day long. Scanning bricks.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       Everything will just get stronger. Yeah. I worked with a guy named Boo Jack in DC. Boo Jack. What giant black guy who was a mason. Does that two words or one word just called himself bootjack. I called him Boo and he go who? Jack? That was probably as one name, right? Yup. Last name or his first name? I think it was his whole name. Bluejack brand name. It's a superhero or something. He should be here. Just a giant. Very, very friendly. Jolly black men with the biggest, strongest hands I've ever seen. He was a mason speaking of big jolly black men with one name. Uh, I met Sinbad the other day. I've never met before. I met him in a parking lot. Our cars were right next to each other. Fully random. Just fully random. What was he wearing? Was He wearing a dangly earring? A check.

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       Was He. Was he dressed in a colorful manner or. No, he was very understated and seemed a completely normal. Like I don't remember what he was wearing. He might be wearing what you're wearing right now. He always struck me as a nice, very, very nice guy. Very nice guy. And what's he doing now? Doing standup. Still touring? Yeah. You know, still got an audience. Oh yeah. He's a funny dude, man. Apparently he was really funny on kill Tony. They did a kill Tony episode and Sinbad side end is one of the um, the guest judges. Yeah. You know, they have a new guest every week and they said he was killer. He had to do to have been doing it for that long. They've got some tricks up their sleeve. It's a real comic. It's been around forever. Been communicating with an audience for a long time, but it's just nice to meet him in it and see that he's a nice guy.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       You know, those guys. You ever met anybody who was not so nice? If I did the wrong way maybe five years ago, I would have told you. Yeah. But now I'm like, why? Why, why bring heat on someone from some weird moment that I probably could have done myself if I was true. If you've run into someone and you're in the wrong head space, maybe you just got done, somebody yelled at you and maybe you have a business deal that went bad. Maybe you got cut off on the highway. You never know when you're running into people. It's just we vary so much liquid. We would like to encourage each other to be on a good track all the time, but I think we need a little bit more forgiveness when someone does something stupid. I'm going to call my next special, I think bipolar ape because that is what we are.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       We are men and if you stop and you freeze frame on somebody when they're having a moment, you can catch them in any like that whole spectrum, the human spectrum center in St and anything in between. You can catch them in a terrible moment or a great moment, but you can't decide that that's what they are all the time and that's what we're doing. Now. Let's get to that. We quantify certain things that are just dumb, like there's certain things you just never, you're just not going to bounce back from the Rachel Dolezal thing, which she pretended she was black but trialist and black much. You know what I'm saying? But there's like those things where it becomes a nationwide thing and I bet she's a lovely lady. I Dunno, I have no idea. I have no idea. That might be empathy gone wild or that might be sort of this, this, uh, I think a lot of times everybody wants to be an individual.

Speaker 1:          00:06:59       They want that. That's always been a problem with the human condition, right? You want to, you want to be, you want to be unique. We all do, right? Even though we all believe in equality, we all want to be not equal. We want to be a little better than the next guy, or at least unique. And that's maybe where competition comes from itself. But I think sometimes people negotiate that issue and that problem with a, with a very clumsy apparatus with a really weird way of doing it. I'm going to be trans racial or I'm gonna. I'm going to wear dishes in my ears and, and, and literally cover my whole face with tattoos. That's fine. Super Common. There might. Yeah. That might be a better way to negotiate that, that problem you're having because it's a, it's still pretty surface. You have a look at the Hashtag face tattoo on instagram.

Speaker 1:          00:07:43       No. Holy Shit. There's a lot of people get in their face tattooed like it's like what? Slow down, slow down. It goes back to wanting to be seen. Well, I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense in terms of like people wanting to belong to a group that seems cool and like black people seem like overall a cool group, right? Like you have good music behind it. They have a funny way of talking. They have all these amazing pro athletes. They have a totally different kind of culture and you identify with that culture but you can't get in because you're a white girl. You're like, Shit. It's also something. I think also there's a romance to when you're on the outside looking in it struggle. Oh yeah. And I'm being having been oppressed and all those things. And yet you yet you triumph, yet you find a way to be funny, yet you find a way to be colorful, yet you find a way to be artistic.

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       Rap came from from, from the South Bronx. While it was literally on fire. Yeah. And rap is just one aspect of it. Right? I mean think about it. Some of the very best stand up Comedians, some of the very best musicians. And we think of the percentage of the population that's black, 12 percent the percentage that become elite professional athletes mean what is the percentage of NBA players that are black? It's something crazy. A lot of it's also just. What is it you think? I don't know, but it's pretty high. I mean 69 personally. Probably something. I don't know why I said that number. Jamie, are you a lot of it might be just also that there are two. There are two avenues open to you in a lot of black communities. At least it's changing, but you know it was sports and music for sure. That's.

Speaker 1:          00:09:20       That probably plays a part in it, no doubt about it, but it's also there's a sort of extraordinary number of professional athletes like elite athletes. Yeah. That just happened to be black. And what is that though? Is it genetic? Is it, is it the environment that are coming from. I mean it's, it's a fascinating thing to be explored because for all this talk of racism, if you just want to be really honest, there's a lot of African Americans that have some pretty phenomenal genetic traits like fit, like Carl, like think of like who's like Jamie, who was like the biggest freak all time? A athlete basketball player. Would it be probably the Bron Jim Bron James Probably. Right. And then you have Michael Jordan is another freak athlete, right? I mean how many of those guys like that stuff? Because people would argue like Larry Bird, but it was a phenomenal shooter, but he wasn't the kind of freak athletes.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       Lebron is Dr Jay Jordan would use to literally fly, fly through the air. There are a couple of guys that can do things like that, but they don't have the overall. Yeah. Well, so, so if you look at, there's a book called the sports gene that talks about this. If you look at Africa, it's, it's probably the most genetically is the most genetically diverse part of the world, right? I mean, the Africans from the bar for coast are totally different in the Africans from, from say the highlands of Kenya, Ethiopia, the Africans from the Sudan, the Dinka and the new attend to be almost seven, six, sometimes. Certainly seven feet is not that uncommon in many people don't realize Egypt, supportive Africa very much so. I mean the Tunisia, Morocco, that's more Arabic, right? Um, uh, but then you've got, I mean, it's fascinating. This is really, it was, and let's go to Ethiopia, Ethiopia, they grow to an average height, a beautiful people.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       There was a lot of trade and that side of the world, the Eritrea, they're dead. They've been renowned for their beauty. If you just step over the border, just just go right to just one, one south or one north. You are going into Sudan and south Sudan, tallest people in the world. Talls people in the world. And I mean, some of them can be like a fist off at eight feet, that's where like new bowl and those people came from, okay, if you go just another country, just one more country east, now you're in the Congo and that's home to the pygmy. So you've got the shortest people in the world in one country and then just cross the border, one of the tallest in the world in that country. So Africa is insanely diverse. But if you look at the athletes with the most explosive power, and if you like that, that includes the fast people in the world who are in Jamaica and who are, um, you know, in the United States, genetically, you can trace them back to a very primal marilee.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       You can trace them back, very small part of Africa according to this book, the sports gene, which is the Africa most, um, and so that is where, that's where you'll see the fastest, most explosive people. However, having said that, you can hear it deion sanders talking, watching this white running back 215 pounds. He ran a four, three, 5:40. And he was like, I can't say this on tv, but he can run, run, run, run, run. And it was true. It was like, you haven't seen a white guy run a four, three, five in forever. It's pretty rare. There's gotta be some Viking genes floating room. Sure. But there, there is no, I don't think there's any black quarterbacks in the NFL, quarterbacks cornerbacks. It's just fascinating when you stop and think about just the sheer number of people involved in professional athletics, the sheer number of people that make a living playing a game with their body.

Speaker 1:          00:12:57       Yeah. But I don't know if that kind of athleticism helps you become a champion in tennis. You know, there are different. Depends on the sport and sports specific. Right? Well, I mean first of all, black people historically have not been into tennis because they didn't have money. It's Arthur Ashe was obviously Athena, but Arthur Ashe was like way before they're telling. Right. So he was like the groundbreaker. But how many mean now? I'm sure a lot of kids growing up in Nice communities, they have tennis clubs and stuff like that. African American kids. But it's less a thing of that culture. The thing like there's not a lot of Italian American tennis players either. You know what I'm saying? Like my people don't play tennis, they don't get into tennis. It's not an economic thing. It's just a cultural of the same way. Yeah. So when you see all these like world class tennis players, it just happened to be of the, you know, rich upper crease coach.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       You need a lot of stuff with tennis. You know, it's a lot going on at tennis plus nobody gives a shit until you're really good. You know, like if you're kind of like, if you have a chance, holy plays a Semipro ball for, oh maybe we'll get into the big leagues, you know? But if you don't, if you like obviously my pro tennis player get a fucking job, bitch, what are you doing? You playing tennis? It takes a long time. I used to know this dude who was a professional racquetball player and that was the grind nerdiest of all grinds because when I was 19 I recognize like, oh no, this dude done painted himself into a corner. He's like a world champion. It's something nobody gives a fuck. Nobody cares dude. Nobody cared. And people would treat him like, Oh, poor guy. Like that was part of it.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       It was like he's awesome but poor guy. Well I feel like way when I watched the biathlon picks and shit or curling or. Yeah, the sports will curling is, don't talk shit about curling in Newfoundland. If you go up there and Canada, they get fucking angry at you. I don't give a fuck. They get mad. So I don't care that you replayed the curling move in slow motion. I didn't miss it in regular motion. You know, there's just certain sports. I don't think their skills are not sports. Like what? Uh, how to races, how to racist deal with the fact that there's so many elite black athletes. What is it? Because you just look at it and how do you see white superiority in that many. I've heard, I've heard guys in New York, white guys would always say this about, about I'd hear white dudes in there talk about black and white athletes like this.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       They'd be like, well he's brother. So obviously he's going to be faster and stronger, but this kid over here has got heart and he's got smarts and then so like guys who apparently got heart brain, whereas the black guy only has muscle. It was a clear indication that you're just, it was such a racist kind of way of delineating, you know, what's also delusional because people want to assume that because someone has physical attributes, they don't have mental attributes, they always want to say that. And sometimes it's true because sometimes when you have physical attributes, life is easier for you and you get soft. You don't have to work as hard. Like one of the more impressive guys in the UFC for me has always been Frankie Edgar because that guy's just a product of hard work. He's never been a knockout puncher. He's not the biggest guys always in small for whatever division.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       He's in a small 55 and he's pretty small at 45 in comparison to some guys like, you know, like Ortega, we fought this weekend, right? Brian's much bigger than. I'm taller, longer. He's just all heart and will and toughness. And, and I love that, and I think that's an admirable thing and I think you can get out a lot at a Washington guy like that, but it doesn't mean that a guy can't have that mindset and also have some fucking ray Lewis body. Well man, it's my turn was the example of that. Nobody and coby Brian was saying, nobody works harder and that's why they and they, they love to win in the almost psychotic way. Extreme winters are that way. Yeah. That whole thing, that extreme winters is why we're here folks. It's why it's so compelling. I mean, you, you had to have some godly resolve to get through the Mongol era and the fucking caveman era and think about all the different shit that's happened in between it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       Just think about the people that colonized this country. We were so far removed from people who lived here and rode wagons across the country just 200 years ago. Nothing that just happened. They did this study. Uh, Camille Paglia was talking about this. Why were most of the people that revolutionized the human condition, male, like. So in other words, the printing press and Einstein and copernicus and Galileo and Kepler and all these people that Kinda like you know, and, and why, why so few women and so a lot of academic circles will. The only single variable answer is that women were kept down by the Patriarchy or whatever. It might be very condescending though if you think about it, because that would suggest that women didn't find their way through the cracks. Some of them did, but for the most part and then there's some truth to that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:45       But for the most part, there's another really interesting theory that men have. Men and women tend to have two different kinds of brains. We've evolved that do different. Brian's because women have to watch out for children and pay attention to the minutia and keep them away from death. Whereas men have the kind of brand that can obsess over just one thing, even if it doesn't really bare any relation to the material world. So they can think about whether time bends or whether they the the relationship between time and matter and space, you know, and they'll just delta zero in on that problem and obsessed over that problem and you have those extreme winners that literally to the exclusion of everything else, including their family, including, you know, other people focused on just one thing. But in a lot of ways, thank God we had that aberration because that is what revolutionizes, that is what changes a lot about how we live a little explosions that make this thing move quicker there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       The combustion inside the engine that is human civilization. Every now and then you get someone that just is an outlier. So Elon musk characters drilling holes under the Los Angeles and building fucking power stations from, for solar power. For People's houses. Yeah. Make it fucking cars. She's never going to work. It's never going to work. It's never going to work. He's like, shut up. He's just so much smarter. We let them drill under the city. Will it go ahead. You know what you're doing. Everybody just lets him do it. You imagine if like a regular person wanted to drill underneath the cities and make tubes and put, they'll be like, that's the dumbest idea ever. And it dropped down. A car is going to go on a train and the train is going to go really fast with the car underground. Shut the fuck up. Should have this guy, Andrew Keenan, your podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       I interviewed him. He wrote a book called how to fix the future and uh, also a book called the Internet's not the answer. And, and another book called the call to the amateur and kind of like in the culture, the Amatory Lichens, uh, you know, the infinite monkey metaphor. You ever heard that? Yes. Yeah, it's great. So if you had an infinite number of monkeys just banging away at a typewriter, eventually one of them would, would type out a masterpiece, like a shakespearian play or something. Just randomly, just randomly. Yeah. And as you know, if that was real and it would end mathematically, you can prove it. I get it mathematically, but I still call bullshit, right? Like, it doesn't make any sense. Like what are the odds that just randomly this monkey on just accident put the periods in the right place and the spaces in the right place and the commas in the right place?

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       No, no. It's impossible. It is part of the last chance. Last chance can suck a fat dick. I don't buy it. I don't buy it. I've heard it before by people far smarter than me and I'm like, no, no. There's zero chance raises an amazing question, right? What's. What's amazing is it's like human beings can actually reach beyond that, which they can measure human beings. So it's not just what you can see and measure. It's actually what you can imagine and what you can imagine actually is real. It's a part of reality and all that shit. Yeah, but he said that these infinite monkeys, that's basically what youtube and what the Internet has ushered in. Right. But long story short, when you're talking about Elon Musk, he was talking about how in his book

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       had a fixed future. The nine tech billionaires of the nine tech billionaires, they own more wealth than one point 8 billion people on this planet. We've actually never seen this kind of concentration of wealth. Good. Luckily guys like Jeff Bezos who he knows really well and uh, you know, these other guys like Mark Zuckerberg are kind of aware. They have some historical perspective of where they stand and for the most part they're doing their best to try to figure out a way to be responsible with this wealth. There's also the fact that they're coming from a tech background, which has historically been really fucking smart people. Right. Those are the innovators. So because of that, they're more left leaning. Yeah. Which is probably for what, it's just the whole tech community is more left leaning. Yeah, I mean that's why any, anything that deviates from that, it's kind of punished.

Speaker 2:          00:21:42       Well, the problem though is that now you have the four riders of the apocalypse, Google, facebook, Amazon, and apple. There's so much that, I mean, the amount of co they have, they had access to all your data and to the maps. So it does kind of go. You kind of go, okay, your left leaning, but there has never been this kind of concentration of power. Well yeah, but they're not doing anything with the power that we know of. What would they do have is tremendous wealth like off the charts, tremendous wealth at apple, at Google. I mean they just have tremendous amount of influence and I think when you have that kind of money, like idealistic, hippie leftwing dreamers are way better off like throwing that money around then like really gangster globalists that are, you know, pro war, really enthusiastic about right wing politics like that will be way scarier if all that money, the billions of dollars was in a Cristiana cult that thought that the second coming was going to happen in Jerusalem.

Speaker 2:          00:22:40       So it was very important to protect Israel, which is real. There's a lot of people in this country that want to protect Israel because they think that's where Jesus is pit stop when it comes back. Yeah, you can. I do worry about. Yeah, you should worry about very religious people. So with, with a messianic. Yeah. And that's, that's a real thing today. So I think like secular tended reason based techno freaks who I might disagree with them on some of the most ridiculous asks a ridiculous aspects of progressivism. Like they just go so far off the charts and it's so common now. Everyone is getting so hysterical about things. You know Christina Hoff sommers is. I love her. She's great. She's got love her. She's got literally shouted down offstage. They interrupted her speech, they put up signs. They wouldn't let her talk through. We're calling her a fascist where they sound really confident in their point of view. Huh? It's just so pleased. But they don't engage somebody in ideas a shout them down because you're terrified. Well, what they're doing also is they're getting on Youtube. So there's all these videos of them being woke. Hashtag woke expressing their wokeness. I haven't heard that expression. I know you have. Yeah. You're just talking about it. Yeah, it's a gross

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       word. I think it comes down to what I was amazed. What I'm amazed at is I've talked to some of these far left ideologues, you know, and uh, and especially the people that would shout down, Christine Summers, who is such a reason voice in such an important voice to smart and let her talk and then if you disagree with her, have a conversation with you. Are they typically do a q and a at the end of these speeches that's just rude to her with your ideas. And she's a feminist for fucking podcast is called progress. Actual feminist. That's what her, her thing is her video series that she does now. She's an important person, man. She's not an anti woman in any way, shape or form. She's not the female. I've listened to her and she, she wrote that book, the war on boys. She's, she's excellent. She's excellent.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       But I think a lot of this is like, one of the things I noticed is that a lot of the left wing idiot logs at that first of all are fairly young. A lot of times they don't have a whole lot of experience in the world or you know, they are people who are like, if you just take the average journalist, and I've met a lot of them now and talk to a lot of them, the average journalist, even the average academic in colleges or in the people that are kind of controlling this conversation in certain aspects, they have just not really ever met anybody or worked with anybody that worked with their hands that he spends a lot of time that had to be in the military that, um, they, they tend to be pretty cloistered, you know, I mean, uh, even even Sam Harris by his own admission said that in his Rolodex of 1100 people, he only had one friend who smoked.

Speaker 1:          00:25:25       And that was Christopher hitchens. That significant. It's significant when you are exposed to one element of society. And one of the advantages that I think a comic has when you travel so much is that you're around real people. People that work with their hands, people to do other things that are in the military, people that are cops, people that are, that are essentially a huge part of the fabric of this side who are on the right on uncertainty on the left. And what you start to realize is that your, um, the world is way more complicated as is always the way it is, right? It's just way more complicated. People are way less, uh, uh, easy to pigeonhole there. Just because you supported trump doesn't necessarily mean you are right winner across the board. It doesn't mean you're, you know, about the patriarchy and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       And I find that a lot of young people and I find a lot of people who are trying to be woke and stuff. And we do this as Americans. It's not just the left, it's also the right. We do this as Americans. We want to find a bad guy and we want to put a label on that bad guy. We want a single variable answer. We want a single variable solution, right? So in other words, you are racist, you are a sexist, you are a homophobe, so you've got to be sanctioned and we got to get rid of you. And if we can get rid of racism as if racism has a and do with it. Actually it's about tribalism because people don't need a difference in skin color to hate each other. Have you heard of the Middle East or Africa or even this country? It's not about the melanin in your skin, it's just we're tribal, but, but we tend to want to find that one label.

Speaker 1:          00:26:57       You're a racist. You're a homophobe bibles. Most certainly racist. Yeah, of course there are. You beat. Don't think racism is the problem that we're facing. I think it's more of a tribalism. I think that if everybody was the same color, we'd have no problem, uh, joining groups and hitting each other. No problem. Again. Well, that's where you see the Middle East, that's for sure. Look, Yuval Harari, racism is just a symptom of that. You Bet. Harare's a great book sapiens and everybody should read it. Read it on your recommendation. If the Dinka, the Dinka and the Nuer and the Sudan, let's just take them. They look exactly the same. Just Google it. They have an exact, just racist, right? They like saying all black people have exactly the same. Well, they look, they do. Look, they, they, they are basically, they are, they are they the only way to tell them the difference is the tribal markings.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       But for the most part they're, they look exactly the same. Very similar cultures or hurting culture. A Dinka and the Dinka language means people knew in the new, uh, language means original people. Whoa. And they're sworn enemies. They fucking hate each other. Talk to justin ran about. Yeah, Ta Talk to Justin Wren about how the pygmies are treated in the country right next door. They're brutally discriminated. They can't even go to hospitals or schools because they're short and they're magic apparently. So go fuck yourself. It ain't about color. We don't need color to hate each other. We just don't. We would find something. It would be neighborhoods or lines in the dirt or sports teams. Fuck yes. We, we mean we hate each other from neighboring high schools in the same town. We compete with each other. Maybe it's a good, good natured competition. There's nothing wrong with that either.

Speaker 1:          00:28:36       There's a natural need that we have to compete against each other and conquer each other, and that's because we used to do that exclusively, right? That's how people move. That's what this Viking show is all about. People coming into peoples' villages, fucking them up and taken all their gold and just, that's what people did forever. Fuck yes, and, but here's the other thing. It's really taboo. This is so fucking taboo. Even say this. Now what are you going to risk something so. So the narrative is those people aren't doing well. Let's just take any group of people they're not doing well, right? Because they've been. There's only one answer to that. They've been put down. They been oppressed, they've been suppressed. Yes. Sometimes that's true, right? Nobody can tell me you don't understand the history of this country unless you studied the black experience at least a little bit because that is.

Speaker 1:          00:29:27       That is such a huge part of the history of this country and to be a black person in this country is not something I have no idea about, but it hasn't been easy. Granted, let's just take any ethnic group. If you were to ever like Thomas Soul, who's a black scholar, if you were ever to bring up the idea that maybe part of the problem in certain groups, okay, that aren't doing well, could be internal, could be of their own making, could be that there are certain aspects of that person's culture, whether they're in Hewitt, whether they're Mexican, whether they're black or whether they're a hillbilly white guy. If you start talking about the fact that their culture and the way they. Their belief, their, their, their, their practices could have something to do with why they're not getting ahead. You better be damn careful because now you're blaming the victim because it is true that,

Speaker 2:          00:30:24       well, you're not really necessarily blaming the victim, right? Because the victim in this case is a person who's a part of a culture and we're all influenced by our environment and if you were involved in a culture that has very specific ways of behaving and you're supposed to engage in these and whether it's a know female genital mutilation that they do to children on a regular basis in some parts of the world, like why did they do that? Well, they've just been doing that. That's what they've been doing that. So they just keep doing that. Like there's a lot of weird things that people just get sucked into and then you don't even realize what you're doing. You're 18. You live in that life. Then it becomes a part of your pattern or behavior and then when you're 35 and everyone around you is behaving the same way in the world filled with violence and no one can hit the pause button and go, hey, why we getting each other, Hutus and Tutsis like, what are we doing?

Speaker 2:          00:31:10       No one's like, stop, settle the fuck down. It's like you get locked up in the momentum of your past, of the past, of your family, your ancestors, your community, your environment. Very few people have complete autonomy, so the idea that we're supposed to ask somebody to just figure it out or get their shit together, pull themselves up by their bootstraps. It's pretty preposterous. Fuck yeah, and it's usually coming from people that got a nice juicy hand like life gave you a couple of aces and you got to seven over there and a two and you try to figure out if you can get a flush, like you've got a good hand. You got lucky. So if you say you made it with a good hand, like, oh, congratulations. You won the pot. You got dealt three aces. You kinda. Exactly. You got lucky. Exactly. I'll be the first to admit that should be the first. I mean that some people are born with more advantaged than others. Just a better family. Just stop for a moment and I don't want to get to this are already to Social Justice Warrior II in this podcast, but this is one of the things that pisses me off and said, I agree with so many of those twats on so many important issues and then they get so crazy that they wanted to interrupt people at Christina Hoff summers and yell at. She's a fascist and

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       we just, we just, we. There's just too much conflict. That doesn't make any sense today. They're not reasonable that they're not civil or reasonable, so I don't know where else to go. Like what if you're not going to be reasonable and you're going to decide that you're that right, that you

Speaker 2:          00:32:39       are, that your site is rooted in truth and love and that and my sides rooted in falsehood. Knievel, salt, aggressive issues are all. It's no, no one has ever like super into women's rights but racist, like they're all like there's a pattern of behavior that you're supposed to follow them. It's like really? It's a really interesting predetermined pattern that everybody locks into because it's support gay marriage. It's like all these things. Well, you can yell. It's like, it's like if you're, if you're in favor, if you believe that global warming is caused by human beings, you've got to be in the right. You know you, unless you're. Unless you know where you stand on gay marriage, on everything else like that, that's unfortunately you can't be sort of responsive to evidence. Right? So instead of being affiliated with a party or a candidate be affiliated with the problem, what's the problem?

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       Will agree with all three shooters, right? That socks. Yes. So there's gotta be a way, if we could put our ideas together, create a little idea. Sex. There's gotta be a way, right? There's gotta be a way to deal with this problem. Oh, well, can we talk about the fact that we all agree that the problem socks. Now you're saying we need more guns and this other side saying we need less guns. Is there, is there something, is there something we can. Can we at least start talking instead? Because you know, Brendan on the podcast said, can we agree that a gum problem, the fucking number of hate emails we got to know, want to give up those guns and, and, and uh, yeah. And, and Jim Jefferies was so funny because he goes and his pod. Did you hear that? That, that stand up in it.

Speaker 2:          00:34:08       He goes, here's the argument, because I like them so fuck off. And it's like, that's good enough. Yeah. The constitution says that guns, we have a right to bear arms so we can protect ourselves against tyrannical government. Right? I mean that's, that's what the second amendment. Well, you know, he's like, the government has drones, right? They got tanks, they've got cruise missiles. Your ar 15 ain't doing shit. Another problem. This is, people need to understand this. The government is us. Okay. Everybody that you just described, someone who works in the military, everyone just described someone who's a soldier, two soldiers or civilians, they're the same people. They're people, they're us. We're not talking about some global elites. It's going to take over. They're not taking over with us. We are not going to take over ourselves. We're not. This is not a stupid fucking country.

Speaker 2:          00:34:52       Like the idea that somehow or another the military will start taking them. Well, we have to be careful is people that have extreme power and shit. Judgment. Like that cop that shot that kid in the hallway in Arizona that that horrible video was bad white guy shooting a white guy too. By the way. I don't even know if that has anything to do with racism with a lot of what cops are doing. I think some of it most certainly does, but I think a lot of it has to do with people to just incompetent and they're police officers and they shouldn't be police officers and on top of that, I think the stress of the job just breaks people's brains and I think sometimes people are just so out of their fucking mind with worrying about being shot and dealing with trauma and dealing with violence and dealing with domestic abuse and fucking murdered kids and all the fucked up things.

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       They say. See everyday they're brains are frazzled man and they're stepping out into the street and then they can confront somebody and they just want to fucking shoot. I just want to shoot before they get shot there on a hair trigger, man, that's a couple of seconds to write sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes they plant a gun on the guy. I mean sometimes it's absolutely a dirty cop. Right? You know, sometimes the guy's reaching for his wallet, they shoot him in the car with his baby in the backseat. This has been a bunch of these things, man, and I think it boils down to more than anything, people that are fucking completely incompetent at being a police officer. What's amazing is the number of interactions where you never hear shit about. What's amazing is how many people get pulled over every day. How many people deal with a cop, how many people get questioned by a cop?

Speaker 2:          00:36:20       How many people are in a situation where a cop has to talk to them about something that happened and nothing happens and nobody gets shot. It's overwhelming. The numbers of actual interactions where everything goes okay, far outweigh the dirty cop that shoots the kid in the hallway. Of course, the and the, the, the cop that plants the Taser and the guy after he shoots them. All these different things where there's a dirty guy, there's just people. The number of honorable police officers is actually pretty fucking stunningly positive. So if cops that save lives or stop crying from happiness and all those things protect people. Human beings have this crazy brain right where this negativity bias where something like violence and stuff has such an effect on our brain. We're really good at seeing problems but really bad at, at coming up with the solutions like we tend to jump to.

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       So if you, if there's a problem, if it's a very. It's a very thing about terrorism, right? If people die on, it's a very scary situation. Far More people die of diabetes. Far More people die of heart disease. People die if the way you're eating far more die from all the various pharmaceutical opiates. That's exactly right. I mean, I can't tell how many people die of of aspirin, some crazy number think it's $10,000 crazy, but things are not as sexy, but we tend to react to the things that really scare us. Right? Yeah. We'll violence violence is what gets us not disease. Like, dude, I know two people who have lost loved ones to the flu this year. Yeah. Yup. One of them was a 14 year old girl. Oh my God. Yeah. The flu killed Jesus do this. Flu is no fucking shot for two weeks.

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       Dude, it's. You get a joke. I got. I was going down for a couple of days because I caught it really early on. I knew it was happening and I did nothing. I stayed home and I ate real good and I just slept all day. I let my body I worked out. You can't ask those. The working out ones are the worst. Killed me. I've had that happen before was thinking I was a little bit sick and then I worked out and it just gripped me. Got Me. I'd never been sick like that. Hadn't six since college. I was real proud of myself that I recognized it. I was like, something's going on here. Like I, I'm pretty in tune with what I'm feeling like a pussy. Well, I'm just lazy and when like my body just feels off

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       and I'm like, my body feels off. And then I was like, oh my God, I know sweating and I'd be sitting there with Chili and then I'd be sweating. And I was like, okay, I'm just going to get under the covers and Netflix the fuck out of these couple of days because I did that two days ago where everybody in my family was sick. They, everybody's getting cold. Everybody around was getting cold and I, I, it was eight hours. I'd been sleeping eight hours. I couldn't get out of bed and I was like, I'm tired. I slept. Yeah, fucking slept for 11 hours. Felt tip top. My body fought it. I was like, I'm not moving until it's the mood has to get asked to move and you got to have a healthy body. Folks. This is the one thing that I got from this year and it was only, like I said, it was really only fucked up for like two days, but one thing that God is how wonderful it is to be healthy.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       Yeah. I mean we take this fucking thing for granted. This vitality you take just feeling good. Like right now, right now. Right now I feel great. I feel great. Yeah, me too. Ate Breakfast at, worked out. I'm healthy. Hanging out with my friend. Yeah. There are podcasts. There are two things they talk about like when you do a to a country. Number one is this, this fucking behavioral scientist named. He wrote a book called scarcity and his name is uh, lr chef here and I did a podcast with him and he'd studies like how humans behave when they have. They don't have enough food in their stomach, like most economists wrote their treatises from a full stomach. Adam Smith, the father of capitalism was also living with his mother when he wrote the moral sentiments of man and the wealth of nations. Okay. So, and so he was, what, what you don't hear as, as this, this company.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       Uh, so he was like, well, the Internet Marketing Gurus, and I was like, Ferrari's that he rented this mom's driveway. Well, you know, this, this woman, I was talking about the free market and I'm a free market guy and you know, I'm a capitalist. And she said, that's great. And I've been inundated in the sort of the extreme Milton Friedman Faa High School of Economics. But she was like, she had a thing called doughnut economics and she's out of Oxford and Kate Rayburn. And she, she said, well, you know, what they don't tell you is when Adam Smith was writing the wealth of nations, the fucking handbook for all capitalist and free market guys like yourself is that his mother was like, Adam, dinner's almost ready. And uh, I, I, uh, I folded your laundry, you know, what's that worth? What the fuck is that? You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       So you got to take those things into account. So funny, my, My, my perspective on, on capitalism has always come from a full belly. Never been hungry. I was a wrestler guys. I did have to suck a lot of weight. The point is never been hungry. Never had to worry about where my next meal was coming from. Certainly never had to worry about a roof over my head. That's a. that's a big difference between even a guy like me and you like this. You got your. Your perspective is going to be different. It's going to be adult has to be. There's a level of compassion. I think that as a civilization we haven't hit. We haven't hit the right number. We're in this number where we. We don't give a fuck about each other enough and I think that one of the ways that that could be solved is I've been thinking a lot about universal basis, basic income that

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       if that was a possibility where you could give everybody just a small amount of money, like $12,000 a year, which is like a thousand dollars a month. It's basically enough to get by, but you wouldn't have to think about that. Then you wouldn't have to think about that aspect. Like you would always have food. If we could make sure that everybody always had food and everybody always had a place to sleep, what would that cost? What would it cost to eradicate homelessness to a point where if you were homeless, it was a total voluntary situation. Either you're just a nomad who likes camping or you're. You're mentally ill and you just need to sleep in a box because you think that's the only way that the aliens can't get you. There's, there's those people at skid row is filled with crazy. Crazy. How much, how like what percentage of our cities have homeless people in them?

Speaker 2:          00:42:22       Like is it three percent of the city's homeless? One percent of the city's almost summer climates. It's higher, right? How would, how, how much of an impact would it be if you could just bring that down to zero? I mean, wouldn't that be just great for the way people feel about other people? Well, there are societies that do that. Singapore, certain Scandinavian, very hippie. This podcast is a strong weed. Well, no, I mean, but you're at. You're asking a really good question because they have done these experiments. Twenty billion. That's it. They, they could end homeless, sorry, sorry. With money used to buy Christmas decorations, it would cost about $20 million for the government to effectively eliminate homelessness in the United States of housing and urban development official told the New York Times Monday, December 11, 2012. So I think for what we spend it, it's kind of the wrong question because I give a man a fish or feed them in and teach a man to fish.

Speaker 2:          00:43:19       It's a really tricky. It is. They have to be careful. It's a weird question, but it's also one that no one's addressing. It's like I, you look at people who are homeless to go, Oh, you fucking bomb, get your shit together. All you lazy. Fuck or all you crazy person. Oh, he must be a junkie. You know, so, so can I tell you, so my friend works for does this worse with homeless youth and uh, I'm pretty extensively. Hasn't done it for 20 years and actually the what he'll tell you and he's very compassionate person, but he'll tell you that the system in this city of Los Angeles, there are a lot of resources for people on the street from places to get a computer, places to sleep, places to take a shower there and and what happens is there are a lot of people that get this network. They figure out where to go and one of the things that they are talking about in this community and trying to get kids and homeless people off the street. It's one, one thing. There are a lot. It's a complicated issue, but what has been said and it was shocking to me was they were like, problem is the system is so easy to game. It's so easy to. You can live on the street and

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       live. You can. You can, when you're a youth, you can actually, if you understand how to how to work the system. There are so many resources that a lot of times it doesn't lend itself to really needing to get out of a situation right now, but how many of these kids are playing this out like this with a gaming the system? A lot of really because you're a human being, so you figure out where you can get your breakfast, where you can get a shower, where you can get your computer, where you can get your hangout, where you can get all these things somehow under that's hurting them. I'm not saying, look, I'm not saying we shouldn't have these resources. Right? I thought it was fascinating that a lot of the people that are really on the front lines and all in this are saying that the the ironic and frustrating thing sometimes can be that it does create not complacency, but certainly there are way more resources than you think.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       There are people that have worked very hard to address this problem and people do it when they know where to go. They do know where to get food. They do know where to get a shower. They do know what to do so they can live on the street. There's. There's many levels to this. Right? First of all, one of the big levels, the inescapable is mental illness. Yeah. Those people. There's a lot of people that are wandering around the street that really should probably be in some sort of an institution. Yes. Getting healthcare. Yes and medicated. Yes. But how do you force someone to do that and is it that, is that the issue or is it a funding issue? You know, that was an issue apparently. Putting Reagan. Yeah. When Reagan was in office, they lower the standard of what's Cuckoo for cocoa puffs and they just let a bunch of dudes just wander through the street.

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       That actually wasn't the. It was a little bit more complicated than that. It was. It was at the state doesn't have a right to keep you against your will if you don't want to be. Right. So. So there had to be very specific criteria for that. So you know, this whole thing with gun control, like we need to help mental health issue. Well, there's, if you talked to the psychiatrist will be like, look dude, the criteria for getting tougher, saying, saying and getting somebody essentially classified as a danger to society and uh, like a real threat is very steep. It's hard to do. Yeah, you, you, you can't do that because somebody talks to themselves. You can't do it because they're hearing voices. Well, the other doesn't want to visit that kid two years ago, right? The kid who shot up to school in Florida and they decided he wasn't a threat, but he might not have been a threat to years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       Like people saying, Oh, you know, they visited them two years ago. They're incompetent. No, he might be a different person now you have to realize that like people get way worse. Like we've all known people that we knew at one point in time in your life, then you don't see him for six years and then you see them, you're like, whoa, well that's because people evolve and sometimes they evolve and sometimes they don't. Sometimes they recede. Sometimes it gets ugly. So definitely didn't you go crazy? Aren't you talking about how because 20 percent of boys in this fucking country, r, d, a r, r, a diagnosed with Adhd, diagnosed of course because you haven't spent 10 minutes with you who's not an expert on Adhd. It could be a thousand other things. I just. We have a boy. It was on Rhonda. Patrick

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       posted up to study and then we're lugging a d hd was something that was not the one that was created. See if Google this too. Sorry. Adhd was the one that was created by the advertising agency. What a surprise. There's been several conditions that were literally invented by advertising agencies in order to promote a cure, so it's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Yeah. Look, I don't know how much of that is a real disease and maybe maybe some of it is. Maybe I'm not. I'm obviously not an expert. Maybe some of it is a kid whose brain works different. Right. Let me tell you something, man. My dog might have adhd or whatever the fuck it is. I go to see him and he goes crazy. He's. He's out of his fucking mind. He thinks we're going running, he's running around in circles, he's hopping up and down.

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       He bolts back and forth into the backyard. He's like a maniac, like I can't control them. You know what the solution for that is? I take him running, right? I don't lock them in a room and then drug them. You know what I was wanting to dealing with little kid. You know when I was really focused. You know what? I wasn't focused Algebra. You know what? I was really focused. If somebody started talking about fighting and how to throw a right hand, just think about what I'm saying with my dog. I mean there's really something to that. Like that dog wanted to go run and invite you to forced him to sit into a room. He would go crazy bark and he wouldn't want to do that. That's how kids are exactly the same goddamn thing. There it is. Yeah. The drugging of the American boy.

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       But what was the tweet? Jamie? Is this an esquire article? What did it. What did the tweet say? One in five boys will be diagnosed with Adhd by the time they make it to high school to date. Only one significant study has looked at adhd misdiagnosis and found 20 to 25 percent of boys were misdiagnosed and this was before a d, h, d was a ca as common as it is now, so they're saying it's a real issue. I know quite a few people that are drugging their kids. This is my next door neighbor. They put their fucking kid on Ritalin. There was nothing wrong with this kid. I talked to that kid all the times. It just takes too much energy that you just had too much energy and they didn't want to deal with it and they weren't paying attention to them. They worked all day and then the kids bouncing off the walls and nobody wants to take care of the kid and so they put him on Ritalin.

Speaker 2:          00:49:39       Awful dude, it's happening everywhere. It's happening. The bad side effects some of these drugs. Look at this, six point 4 million children between the ages of four and 17 have been diagnosed with Adhd by high school. Nearly 20 percent of all boys will have been diagnosed with Adhd. A 37 percent, 37 percent increase since 2003. My son, my son is a classic example of a kid who doesn't like to sit still and rough houses. Google does have adhd, so if a school's have no time for horse, they have no time for boy energy. No, you're. You're. You're condemned because it's aggressive and my son is the way to not be a boy. He's being told that his hands are hot lava and he can't use his hands. That's healthy. Oh my God. What kind of liberal school you've taken for public school? Public School. That's what happens.

Speaker 2:          00:50:26       That's awful. This is what we're dealing with. A 1900 adhd was first mentioned in 19. Oh, two British pediatric pediatrician. So it must be a wrong one. A different one described an abnormal defect of moral control and children. He found that some effective children could not control behavior the way a typical child would, but they were still intelligent. Maybe it was restless legs syndrome. Was that. Didn't you tell me that one might have been, but I don't know. Who was the. Who was the guest? Do you remember? The guest was a woman who was telling us all about this. Some medical expert. Was it Kelly Brogan? It might've been. Might've been Kelly Brogan. Dr Kelly, but what didn't you say weren't. Aren't there studies about school shooters and a lot of them were on SSR. I's and stuff. Yes. Mass shooters. Not just school shooters, but like even this Vegas Guy, the Vegas guy was on anti anxiety medication.

Speaker 2:          00:51:22       Yeah, that stuff in. That's also Chris Cornell was on anti anxiety medication. There is a lot of people who are on psych drugs who lose their fucking minds because psych drugs are not universal. Right? Like there's no thing like here's a perfect example. Say if you have a. There is a solution that makes alcohol 91 octane. Right. And you add something to that and you can add some additives and it'll spike it up and you could try to find the right mixture, but that's just fucking gasoline. You throwing things in there and try to mix it up. You don't know exactly what the right thing is. That's how they're doing your brain. Correct. When the chipkey these things, that's why they say, try this one. There's not like, okay, you have one cup of flour, you need two eggs and one tablespoon of sugar. No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 2:          00:52:15       There's no specific recipe. And what the fuck does feel good mean that the other thing that they're not taking into account is said, you know, you might be depressed for a good reason. In other words, if you made me do a job I hated and, and I wasn't allowed to work out or I didn't know how to eat or a thousand things. They make me feel good because I have to self regulate. Yes. I'm 51 and I gotta I gotta I still have to self regulate because otherwise, um, you know, I'll go crazy if I don't have. If I didn't know how to do those things, I would probably be depressed now. Now you're going to give me drugs. Well that's not going to help me. Well, here's what it is. What I'm doing. My behavior is what it is. For sure, but here's where I think you've got to recognize that that kid, your son who has that energy, that's a gift and what you're doing is you're making them squander that gift by sitting them down in a fucking charity, wants to go crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:53:04       That kid is supposed to be like my dog running around all day. Okay? My dog is a year old at seven. He's a seven year old dog basically, you know, in dog years and he's like a seven year old kid. He's running around, he's going fucking crazy, you know, but that's because he wants to run. Exactly. But once he runs, he's high dogs the best. Yes. And your kid will be to, if you, if your kid was involved in something where they emphasized physical movement and then taught things in between workouts, taught things in between, you know, they play a game outside, play a little dodge ball, play a little soccer, play a little basketball. Then after you wear yourself out a little, come sit down. We're going to teach about math. Teach them about math and then you know you're going to show them, this is leverage.

Speaker 2:          00:53:46       We're all going to pick things up. Can you think you'd pick it up like or like let them now pick it up with leverage. Oh, you see, you understand you could teach kids in a very physical way instead of forcing them to sit down. Who the fuck wants to sit that hard ass chair? We feel other people's gum on the top of your leg. You know, it sucks. It sucks. You're sitting there waiting for the fucking class to be over stuck. Don't get it. Their energies. How did I ever tell you that? My acting teacher who looked at me time is the greatest. And he goes, uh, I had done a scene. He goes, you know, we got it with you. Get a little self esteem problem. You think of yourself as a second banana. And I was like, what? He goes, yeah, you got to start believing in yourself more.

Speaker 2:          00:54:28       He goes, you got to start thinking of yourself as a first banana. Did he say this when he was in his underwear? He did. He was, I was wearing, I was wearing, I was wearing black place on it. He was put these black lace on Nissan. Hey God, I'm going to pierce her nipples. Know this. What's that? Why? Why do you smell a Cologne that persil this is weird. So he, he says that to me and I'm a young actor and I'm fucked up of her and I'm like, I got to get better. I got to get a higher self esteem. So I say to my buddies, kind of group of guys, one of my buddy's older and wiser and I said, man, I, I was told I have low self esteem, you know, and I heard fortunate back over there goes, thank God you really think you'd be this funny if you fucking like yourself bro, and you think you'd be a fucking actor if you liked yourself, go fuck yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:55:14       That guy's an asshole. Keep hating yourself. It's the best part of you. That's how that got tanks. Monk. I know. I was like, you're right. I liked it. The whole point, that whole thing that drives me is the fact that I've never been satisfied with myself and I'm never going to lose that. I, if I, if you make me really happy with myself, I'm not so sure it's a good thing. You know what? You got to figure out how to do, I think not you, but I think humans to somehow or another disconnect you from the result. If you could figure out a way to disconnect you from the result, you could look at it more objectively. You're going to feel the sting of failure. It's a fact, but you have to recognize what that is and intellectualize it. You got to put it in this little box.

Speaker 2:          00:55:54       Okay, this is good because now I'm going to be fucking pumped up to improve. I'm going to recognize the urgency and failure because it's so extremely uncomfortable, but that's not me. What me is, is the person who's doing this and I'm eventually going to be a finished product. I'm going to figure this out, but right now, that little thing that happened that sucks. Like, okay, don't freak out you. Everybody fucks up. Maybe you fucked up this way, but you didn't run into someone's car. Maybe you did run into someone's car, but you didn't do this. Everybody's got their own little fuck failure, a huge part of part of being a human. You got to understand the consequences of doing something incorrectly. The end, especially the humiliating feeling of being like put in your place like you might think you're good at something and then you fail at it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       You Go, oh my God, I got this elevated sense of how good I was at this thing. Now I have to look at it more objectively and I have to get to that place where I thought I was just. People don't want to wear Andy Kalpin. Have you had great very smart guy, brilliant guy. I said, what's best for recovery? And he goes, why do you want to recover? That's what do you mean? He goes, well, why don't you let your body adapt and figure it out. Just eat some food, see how it feels, but maybe maybe suffer a little bit and see what that does because your body might have to compensate and get stronger as a result. Sure. An interesting way of looking at it, I was like, I think there's definitely something to that. I mean, I think that's why people push, right?

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       That's what pushing is. It's forcing adaptation. You're, your body's going, oh my God, this asshole wants to dead lift now. Right? Okay, I've got to, I've got to adapt. Now. That's also with the sauna is you got to. Your body's trying to adapt. Okay, this asshole wants to live at 170 degrees. I have to figure out how to keep everything from shutting down. Let's mass produce these heat shock proteins and try to figure out, you know, how norepinephrine, it's also like being honest with somebody is right. So like it's also kinda like sitting and hearing things. You don't want to hear about yourself. Maybe shortcomings, right? So when somebody says some somebody something to you, like you're not taking yourself, you're not working hard enough or you're not working correctly or you did this wrong, or your ideas are a bit bankrupt. Let me tell you why that shit is not fun at all here.

Speaker 2:          00:57:59       But it's exactly like working out. If you could just sit and listen and take it in, not argue it. Listen, take it in, feel bad. For Awhile, I promise you, I promise you that that's probably the best way to change listening and hearing it because it'll bother you, let it bother you and then let that spurned you to action. If you, if you, if you want to get, if you want to shout Christina summers down or you want to get into your safe space and not hear those things because they hurt you, this is why they're. Yeah, but that's only part of the problem. The real problem is a control power problem. The country, there's control and power problems because these are 18 year old kids and they've just gotten away from home for the first time and they want to exercise their power and they want to change the world and they're fucking babies.

Speaker 2:          00:58:41       They have half baked brains and they want to yell shit out and they think that they're doing the right thing. They really do and they were yelling outside. You can't have. We won't have fascists in our school. You see Jordan Peterson was doing a speech and they were literally at the windows. They climb the walls and got to the windows, were banging on the windows from the outside while the speech went on. Wow Dude. It's disturbing. And everyone inside his super calm and there's people that keep an eye on the window because you hear it cracking. So like there's a smashing this fucking window just banging up against it. The entire time he's talking, he just hear Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang. And they're yelling shit outside about fascism or it's like they don't even know what the fuck that means. Like they literally are just saying it for anybody who disagrees with them.

Speaker 2:          00:59:25       When a real fascist comes along, they're going to be so duped. There'll be, there'll be shot against a wall and shot. That's what, that's what fascists do real fast. But they seem to think that disagreeing with, uh, people were out of their fucking mind. They don't have any quotes fascism, they, but they have no confidence. Right? So, so. Well, because if you're having an argument with somebody and you end up hitting them because they're saying because you don't like it means you don't have. The idea is to compete with their ideas. You know, I don't think it's that dude. I think they're just young and they don't understand what the fuck they're doing. They're, they're, they're enjoying this ability to scream out. It's like I said, practicing. Yeah. Have got way too much power. Their children. Yeah. They're essentially children. Yeah. Yeah. They could go to war, some of them and yeah, they can, but that's not right.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       Anyway. They probably shouldn't be able to. Probably like 21 before you make that decision. The whole thing's fucking crazy. It's crazy that they don't have enough security to keep the fucking kids are banging on the windows. Like what kind of nonsense facility do you run? You just didn't see that comment. Are you guys, do you have the Internet? You guys have the Internet. It's kind of see what's going on. As kind of knew the American culture has always been a few years. Know what I'm saying? American culture has always given like their kids. Is that recently too. I mean, Jonathan, I had talks about this like helicopter parenting and sort of the idea that your kid has his own autonomy and it's very important. I, I've, I've seen all the new science on this. I mean for sure. Yeah, definitely. Your kid has ticks, is allowed to exercise their point of view and have a tantrum and then you have to show them that, that, that there are consequences for that and that's a new way of looking at, you know, a lot of cultures are like, Hey, if you fucking talk to me like that again, I'm going to hit you in the fucking.

Speaker 2:          01:01:08       I'm going to take this riding crop and whack your fucking legs or whatever it might be. So I don't know. Well, we've got a real soft right now. It's a real easy time to be alive and I think ultimately the ship's going to balance out a really do. And I think ultimately a lot of these kids that are super radical now will probably stabilize as they get older and more experienced, would be more embarrassed with some of the things they've done to especially to disrupt free speech. They they should really be embarrassed by that because it's so foolish like you. All you have to do is formulate a really good argument with ideas and then you play those ideas out in the court of public opinion. You do it in some sort of a way where you have a one person representing one side, one person representing the other side, and you beat that idea with better ideas and that's what you're supposed to do.

Speaker 2:          01:01:54       That's the whole exercise and these people that oppose your ideas. You should use that to challenge you to improve your ideas, to make your, improve your ideas undeniable so that when you present that argument, you've looked at it from both sides. There's far too many people, including these people that are interrupting people that are only looking at an argument from the point of view that they would like to be correct and they're only looking at it like she's a fashion. She's a Nazi. They're not looking at real, hey, maybe that's just a lady and maybe she's a nice lady and maybe she's got some points and maybe I agree with her and maybe I don't, but you've got to let her talk like this is all nonsense. Holding signs up and trying to get attention. This is not the time for that. It doesn't persuade anybody over to your side.

Speaker 2:          01:02:32       I'll tell you that much. They don't even try to do that and they're just trying to recruit the troops and then the also the trying to send out a flag that they care and they're out here doing the right God damn thing using my voice. I'm out here using my voice like it's like, no, you're being a little kid that's interrupting their tribe and its ways you're going to be against something. Then to define what they're for. If you ever asked them what their for like I had this conversation quality bro. Was that equality where everything, they don't know what that. Including comedians. I want an equal number. Yeah. You see what that one Bert? Yeah. Yeah. When someone wants to medians men and women, it's the dumbest Shit I've ever heard in my life. Are you funny enough to be on the stage? Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       Then I don't give a fuck what you look like. I don't care if you're. Nobody wants to hear that. Yeah. Remember when Jerry Seinfeld got in trouble because they were like, why's comedian cars having coffee? All white guys. Well I dunno, but you know there are a lot of funny white guys, so fuck off. Funny Black guys too. Well that's what Jerry Seinfeld studies. So essentially I don't care what color they are. I speak the language of comedy or funny. Exactly. And they were like, that sounds racist. Sorry, but that sounds racist. You're dumb and you're fucking dumb. What would you say if you were there? And that lady said that because there was a woman, two guys are sitting in a guy and a girl sitting there talking and they played the Jerry Seinfeld clip and then the woman who was an African American was like, I'm sorry, but that's racist.

Speaker 2:          01:03:59       And I was sitting at home by comic in the world and most of his audiences that most of his ticket pairs are white. He's undeniable that most of the people that go to his movies are white and he and he, he turned it because he's fucking hilarious. Right. But that doesn't have anything to do with what she, what she saying is that he's racist because he's not having black people on his show. I don't know how. But he. And he's saying, no, I don't even care. I just care. Are they funny? I don't care. Like diversity doesn't mean anything to me. I don't care. And she's like, that's so racist. But I feel like when you say something's racist today, you don't have to back it up anymore. I agree. People just back off. Especially if you're saying a white person is racist. If you say a white person's racist, everybody pulls out the microphone though.

Speaker 2:          01:04:44       My magnifying glass. Wait a minute, what have we got here? We're looking at a waste. But they'll also say, you don't even know it. You don't. You don't even know it. Like you're, you're the white supremacy is everywhere and will they teach that at schools now? So now they teach that also at some jobs you have to go to bias training. Yeah. Bias. Conscious bias training. What do they call it? I think it's antibiotic conscious subconscious bias training. Like you might even realize you're racist and you are racist. How many black guys got in late? Because of all this

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       though? Hopefully a lot. A lot of hippie white chicks just want to show they're not racist. Oh, that just got it out of his dick down. Amy. It's just, it's, I'm in the choir jerking off. What's in crying? It's just weird, man. It's just. I never, I've never seen us so divided and part of it has to do with trump for sure. There's like this reaction like that. They feel like I'm really obligated to act. People feel obligated to act and try to make things change, which I think is ultimately good. All this thing, the all what's going on right now does not concern me nearly as much as it does a lot of other people because I feel like people are already reacting to it and already going, what in the fuck you know, and, and the ship is already starting to write itself.

Speaker 1:          01:06:04       Well, the Oscars was the lowest rated I think in the history of the Oscar heard that, but it's also a 26 million people watched. That's a lot of fucking people. That's a lot. Don't Shit on someone who got 26 million people were afraid to be. People get very kind of like, wow, we're getting political here. And when they looked at the numbers, the numbers where they were comparing it to like 2013, there were down $5 million from 2013, I think it was. Guess what was it around 2013 Netflix. True. There's a lot more shit to watch. True. What's it down from last year? There's definitely people that are bored with Hollywood though, like enough. Well, they Hollywood's overreach. I think Hollywood tends to be what bothers me about Hollywood is there virtuous virtue signaling, like they're going to set an example you fucking guys like you want to be liked.

Speaker 1:          01:06:52       Okay. And you're as fickle as it gets. They were the same people that were standing up and clapping for Roman Polanski. I'm sorry man. Well, some of them were. Some of them were really saying some ridiculous shit. I mean, come on guys. It's a long time ago and he's drugged and sodomized at 13 year old. I think he was like more than one too. Yeah. So, so guess what? I can't have that guy. You're not kidding. They wanted to sign a petition to bring them back in the country. I, I can't forgive that. No. Stay in France. Well, they want to bring it back to the country to arrest them and they're really trying hard to do that. And there's people that resist that. I think he's an amazing artist and you know, artists are just be consistent though. You can't system. That's where I draw the line.

Speaker 1:          01:07:36       You can't drug kids. Fuck with Asia Argento, who was one of the, one of the people that came out against Harvey Weinstein, she had been raped by him apparently, and then she had a sexual relationship for 10 years afterwards, which by the way, people like, ah, that I actually forgive that because people go back to the trauma, right? They want to relive it on their own terms, but she signed the petition to for, for Roman Polanski to, you know, to be freed when he was put under arrest and I believe it was Switzerland and now that's not consistent. I'm sorry man, I'm sorry. But if that guy is just as bad as, yeah, you can see the petition online. What was her perspective? She was somebody who thought Roman Polanski should not be prosecuted for something that happened a long time ago. She signed that petition. I would never sign that petition.

Speaker 1:          01:08:22       So there's a lot of disconnect. So I have a big problem with that sort of disconnect. That's a problem. I don't know this woman, I don't know her. Um, I, I believe, I believe what she says about Harvey Weinstein. Uh, and again, you know, people are like, well she went back to the scene of the crime that's very common, but don't sign a petition and then now be this leading voice in this whole, you know, anti harassment. I think it's very inconsistent. I think you have to pay, you have to at least answer to that. Did she comment on once she saw there was a mia culpa there, but it's very inconsistent in it and there's a lot of that out there. There's a lot of that we should make sure that she definitely did that. You'll see it. Just see if you can go the young dreamy.

Speaker 1:          01:09:01       It feels like something that, you know, I looked it up, I actually looked it up. I wanted to see who had signed the petition. I came across her name and I was like, whoa. That doesn't make any sense to me. You know, it just doesn't make any sense, man. I don't get it. I don't know enough about what happened. I know that he drugged in some younger girl. She was 13 and her mom dropped her off. I believe it was there. It was the seventies men, people would just relationship every bit of 20, all that shit the year. Um, man, but I believe he knew she was 13. Then he knew he was going to go away to jail and he left the country to Jesus Christ and say. And then apparently there's another woman that he had done that too. So imagine being on the scene back then.

Speaker 1:          01:09:55       How weird that must have been. Like there had been like think about Roman Polanski, making movies and like what the 19 seventies, right? Yeah. I mean God trying to town. It's only only days. Yeah. Amazing. But they'd only been making movies for like a few decades. It was a real new thing. She signed the petition, but I found a tweet she just put, she put out a couple months ago where she said she regretted doing it. Already. Regretted the signing the petition years ago. She said a mistake robin plants. He's a filmmaker whose work at meijer greatly, but if I ever see him, I'll spit in his face if he's lucky. Yeah. But you signed petition already. Regretted signing the petition years ago already felt it was a mistake. No excuses. It was stupid with this indicates a pattern of behavior that if true and I believe it to be true is beyond unforgivable.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       Well, I think, I think you, you got a good point though about you. She made a mistake in there is something that happens to people that have been violated. Sometimes they blame themselves. That's what I said. So I'm paying for that and there could be a little of that in her decision making process to. I can't. I could be a little bit of wanting to be in with Hollywood, you know, that's not ethically or morally consistent. No. And she fucked up and she realized she fucked up. But you're also coming after people now, you know, if we're gonna, if we, we're going to end and a lot of these people you know, deserve to become after. But you know, we have to be consistent here. Right? But isn't she begins being consistent by just saying that she fucked up and she realized that she fucked up. Well, there are a lot of people are saying that once they get caught, well that petition the petition doesn't mean Jack Shit. They ain't letting him. He doesn't matter. He signed it and it was at. I don't know anybody that would sign that and like I would never sign that petition. That's all I'm trying to say. Being consistent if I'm. So if the guy came to America and got arrested and went through the trial and then got convicted, how much time would you do? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:11:49       What's interesting is like would it be better karmically to go to jail for what he did come back, go to jail and then no one. Everyone would always know. When you got out that you were convicted and you were punished for child molestation, like you did it and they got you. Everyone would know. Whereas now he's living in France and he has to deal with it floating over his head. Everyone who meets me knows that I drugged and raped a kid everywhere I go. Everyone knows a drugged and raped a kid and it just keeps playing out in his head all day long. Public shaming is powerful shit. Well, I mean that's the highest level. Yes, this is drugging and raping a kid. I'm a forgiving guy. Can't figure that one. I. I can't like. I'm a forgiving dude, man. I can't stay mad and I think it's good to be forgiving about things.

Speaker 1:          01:12:42       There are certain things that to me when you, and he's a great filmmaker and a great artist for me, that kind of stuff. It's very difficult, man. It's very difficult. I had an argument with a bunch of older actors about this and they were all saying it was a long time ago. She looked up and I was like, if it was your daughter and she was 13, how would you feel? You just got to keep going back to that. Well, especially if you actually have a daughter, you actually have a daughter that's not. You're not conceptualizing that your gut. It actually locked into your brain. You're actually thinking about your daughter and it becomes a different completely different thing. I remember thinking when I was young, you know? Yeah. If someone did that to my daughter, but then it was like before I had a kid, it was like, that was just a weird concept that didn't seem real.

Speaker 1:          01:13:26       But now you think about this 13 year old girl and you're like, whoa. But what a court would do and what a trial would do is you might hear something like, I don't know, but you might hear. I don't know. She said, she said she was 20. When we talk about drugging, hold on. She smoked a little weed that, that guy gave her over there. Let's be careful. Right then. Then you start hearing all the extenuating circumstances and maybe you would go, you got to do the time, but at least I get how that happened because you thought it was something different. Right? What was your intention? What did you see? But we don't know that. So what happens is we start and we're doing this too, and I'm doing it. I don't know. I don't know all the details of the case. So. And all I'm saying is that he drugged and sodomized a 13 year old. Here's goal that everyone

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       was drugged, him included. Well, there's this what I'm saying, so we all have to be, we all have to be careful and I have to two, because I'm, I'm kind of breaking my own rule here. I'm, I'm drawing these very strong, hardened fast, uh, like there's no context and what I'm saying, there's no nuance in what I'm saying. There's no context. Right? And you got to be careful because everything is nuanced and context in a way otherwise otherwise you. Otherwise you're taking me at just the words I'm saying. So what I'm seeing from this, this is like she's upset and you're upset. Like she's upset. She signed it and Europe said she signed it. But that doesn't mean nearly as much to me. Like people making a mistake like her making that mistake doesn't mean much to me. It's just a mistake. It doesn't give it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:57       I'm not going to have the thing, you know, there's, there's no consequences. No one got hurt because of that mistake. You know what I'm saying? Like it was a mistake. She fucked up, but it didn't ultimately hurt anyone. Like it doesn't. I don't like the fact that someone would at least temporarily have that thought in their mind like, that guy should be free, like leave him alone. What's bygones be bygones. Actually talking about something different. What are you talking about? So I'm talking about.dot Hollywood tends to do. I was just using her as an example. Hollywood tends to do that which is popular, that which is going to make them liked rather than something that's morally or ethically consistent. That's what I mean. We've talked about this before, that it all comes down to the whole process of being chosen to do things with being chosen to direct or chosen to act or chosen.

Speaker 2:          01:15:41       Everybody's constantly working to be chosen. You're all trying to audition for things. We're trying to angle to get a certain role. It's a constant process of like me, like me, like me and these are people that go into this job with his yearning, desire to be loved and then on top of that they're playing this weird political game. I mean, acting is all political. I mean, it doesn't make any sense that every other occupation except maybe tech tech's probably like mostly mostly liberal, but Hollywood is almost exclusively liberal and if you step out of those lines, nobody wants to work with you anyway. Hollywood on the surface is liberal, but actually nobody who's conservative or whatever will speak out. Right. Like Tim Allen lost his show because he's. Because he's conservative. He's an old white guy. What are you expect? Well, white guys. Yeah, that's apparently golf.

Speaker 2:          01:16:29       Probably a very real thing nowadays. I started hanging out with Dennis Miller. Same thing. He went fucking James. James Woods is crazy. James Woods is arguing with people on twitter. Like James, you're 70 years old. Crazy. How many days you got left? How many? How many moments in your life do you really have left? Do you have a thousand? Like, what are you going to do? You're gonna waste. 400 of them on twitter. Yeah. That's not wise. That's not a wise lady. Said he was blackballed for his conservative views. What is he really? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know man. I don't want to. Again, I don't want to be, um, I don't know if I'm being helpful. Right? So. Well, so you know, you call out certain people. Are you talking about the inconsistency is most people are doing the best they can and trying to make the world a better place.

Speaker 2:          01:17:16       Right? So I think most people would just look rolling downhill in a hamster wheel. He thinks, I'm trying to figure out how to stop this fucking thing. Yeah. Most people are just on full on momentum. Most people are definitely not thinking about how to be, make the world a better place. Occasionally people think of that. What they try to think is how do I get buy number one? Then how do I get better? How do I get ahead? Number two, those are the things they think of and occasionally what's going on? What's up it over there? Yeah. Fucking trump. And then they go back to work until you can do sometimes. Yeah. Most people, that's most people like James Woods. It's like Jesus James, I get it, but you're not changing hearts and minds on twitter. While the funny shit though sometimes I was going to say like funny guy, the biggest thing is like, you know, are you, it's really hard to persuade anybody.

Speaker 2:          01:18:04       It's fucking like I was thinking about why would the times I've changed my mind hard to change my mind was I never changed it in an argument. Change it. Yeah, right. I changed it in a conversation. I don't mind changing my mind. I think that's important too. You know, and I've, I've changed my mind before and people got mad at me, bro. You change your mind like, yeah, I changed my mind. I learned some new stuff and then went, oh, okay, I can't defend this old idea and I'm not an idea. Stupid. The first. What's the, what's the first rule? And being a scientist doubt, uh, ignorance. You don't know anything and then you, you make sure that you're responsive to the evidence and then if you, even if you build up a whole reputation on your conclusion, you have to be willing to change or conclusion based upon new evidence.

Speaker 2:          01:18:50       And you have to, you have a finished product. Yeah, exactly. Your finished product. Oh, it's amazing. You're a verb. Yeah, well I'm. I'm definitely smarter than I was three months ago. It's different person to. How about how about the differences in you when you were 28 and now it's a human person. Yeah, totally different human. Yeah, but that raises an interesting question too, so okay, you're a very different person. What if you did something awful? Then let's maybe murder and now you're in. Should they let you go? Right, and now at 51, I'm so different than when I was 21. I don't remember that. I was such a moron. I was a moron at 30. I remember feeling that awkward lack of control I had for myself, like feeling how awkward it was and we wishing I had more composure. I remember actively feeling that at 21 that it was so impulsive and so crazy and I wished I was more composed and I would see people that had their shit together and I would really admire them.

Speaker 2:          01:19:42       I look at that guy all composed and shit dressed nice, knows what to say when not to say it. Meanwhile, blurt things out that I should never say. How about the way you look? Like do. I was thinking about the way I looked at certain things like women and their capabilities when I was a young man. I did. You know, it changed me in looking at women in in a different light, the UFC and having children with a woman and watching how good she wasn't raising kids and all the things that that takes, that's a certain type of strength and then watching women like paige vanzant fight three rounds with a broken arm that that was all something that I didn't think belonged. That was an arena I was not aware of that kind of feminine strength or fortitude or whatever you want to call it.

Speaker 2:          01:20:26       It causes me to look at that gender differently than I did before. So in a lot of ways I'm a different person and as you get older, that's what happens. You see the world differently as you are exposed to more data and exposed to more and different paradigms and examples and I think that's a good thing. It is a good thing. It's also, it's ridiculous. The female male debate back and forth is ridiculous because people vary so much inside those groups that for someone to say, all women do this, women are all thinking this will be like, no, no, that doesn't make any sense. That's just as stupid as saying, men do moon all dues. All mandus. No, no, that's not. That doesn't make any sense. What it fucking human beings. There's a great number of men that do this stupid thing and a great number of women that say this annoying thing is a great number of people that are just looking to skate by in this life.

Speaker 2:          01:21:15       Men and women, because a great number of dummies, there's a great number of really inspirational, fantastic people that also have vaginas. There's a lot of them had really smart ones that blow your mind in a conversation and they just happen to be female and there's a lot of them that are just happened to be male and they they. That male who happens to be fucking brilliant and articulate and mindblowing has almost no fucking relation to some idiot shithead. Ditch digger asshole. Yeah. Which nothing wrong with taking digital folks. Just don't dig ditches if you're an asshole. Trying to be. No, but it's also like if one of the things I noticed, you have a lot of people from different backgrounds. You got to Nigeria in this corner, you've got Pakistan in that corner, you've got China in that corner, you've got fucking America. You got a white guy from Iowa when they all have to get food out to a group of people in a restaurant or they gotta figure out a way to run a business together.

Speaker 2:          01:22:07       All that shit didn't. Nobody has time for that shit. Everybody's kind of working toward a common goal. Nobody has time. If you actually have something important to deal with when you don't have something important to do, start looking at like weird shit. Like I fucking hate ginger's Ginger's role. The devil. Now you start looking at things different. You know, you start looking at the differences and getting annoyed with stupid shit. Yup. Yeah. I think all human beings, just like your son have a physical requirement. There is a bond requirement that we all have with each other. There's a love requirement that we all have with each other. We have to get a certain amount of love. You've got to have a certain amount of bonding and comradery with the people around you and these needs should be legit, like they give you like a vitamin C chart.

Speaker 2:          01:22:50       USD, a recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. is this recommended daily allowance of iron? Is that like all that stuff is important for your body? I think you have an equally important requirement for your. Your mind? Yes, and for just your physical being like not necessarily your body in terms of like nutrition but just love and warmth. Like the human touch, you know the babies will die if you don't touch them, right? Yeah. It was called failure to thrive. So in hospitals when they have babies that don't have parents, they have people that come around and hold the babies. She's not held. You can feed the baby and everything. If the baby's not held, the baby will die. Fuck, I have to be touched by another human being. A baby has to. Yeah. It's like water or food. That's a fucking requirement. And I think that this, this is being violated in schools when you teach in little kids with tons of energy and the way they cope with that violation is give those kids medication that makes them conform and we just accept that.

Speaker 2:          01:23:49       And then people get on anti anxiety medication and people get on all this medication, that medication and how many of these medications are clearly described because your life sucks or prescribed rather because your life sucks. How many of them is it? Half? Is it 30 percent? Like what number of people actually have something wrong with their brain and what number of people have something wrong with their brain because their life sucks, right? God dammit. I hate going over this same subject over and over again because it's just so. Well, it's hard to hard to come up with answers because it all depends. It's drilling. I was talking to Andy Galpin about that. I was like, well, uh, is, is this vitamin good for you or is this supplement could fee or is this. I was showing him stuff I take and he goes, it depends. It just depends on your body.

Speaker 2:          01:24:32       It depends on what you're. What are you doing with your body, what, what is, what is your routine like on a daily, on a weekly basis, what kind of stresses you putting your body on? Some things work, some things don't. There is no clear cut, single variable answer. It's just so fascinating that all of our bodies have different requirements because we literally developed in different parts of the world. I know and scooted over here in a boat. Started fucking each other. Oh, look at you. Allergic to cats. Like all just weird things that stuck with us. I do better with goat dairy and me too and I do with Mediterranean than I do with Holstein cow dairy dude. My daughter, when she was little, she would throw up if she drank cow's milk, but she would drink goat's milk and she'd have no problem with it at all.

Speaker 2:          01:25:14       Yeah, it's weird. Ben, like human dairy. Well, do you fuck with raw milk at all? Yeah, I used to, but not anymore. I'll fuck with raw goat milk. I can't do raw milk. A cow would rather get raw goat milk because first of all, do they treat goats the way they treat cows? I figure if you're running goats, you probably like a little bit more animal friendly goat milk in the world from this amish from the Amish Shit. It's which and creamy and delicious. Would you imagine? Let's go on a limb here and guess would you imagine there's factory farming of goats like milking commercial large? Sure. There is. Like I get, there's certain ultra pasteurized milk called Meyers that I get. Sometimes it's really good, but it's ultra pasteurized, but I'm sure that's that. The problem is when you talk about factory farming, here's the problem,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       right? So we want consistency in our food. So you want to buy eggs and you, when you go to buy a carton of eggs, you know they're going to cost a dollar 50 or $2 and 50 or $3 and 50, whatever you, you know that they're going to cost a certain amount. You don't go to the store and one day they're three slash 50 and the next day they're $12. And the reason for that is this, that we figured out a way to create enough eggs so that there is enough of a lot so that we can keep the price at a certain level. The problem with if you had all these family farms. Okay. Which I've always been a fan as I always talk about family farms versus factory farms. Awesome. Brian never done a day of farming in my fucking life. Don't know anything about it, but I done my reading.

Speaker 1:          01:26:44       So here's Brian again with his point of view because he's read some stuff and he likes eating at Erewhon and whole foods. Okay. Because I can afford it. So I like family. I've, I like family's family. Farming is bad. The problem is that if you look at the way farming it works is that some family farms aren't as good as other family farms for a thousand reasons that is not as productive, not as proficient. So what would happen is that family would say, hey bro, I know you're a chicken farmer too, but you're not doing it right. Let me buy your farm. I'll buy your farm for 15 times. What it's worth right now, you need the money, but I'm going to secretly, I know I'm going to make my money back because I know how I knew how to do it better than that guy and then I do that.

Speaker 1:          01:27:29       Now I get up, I go and buy a machine that's actually faster and I go to the next form and I say, hey bro, you're not going to compete with me on the market anyway and you're not as good. Sell me your farm and what happens? Is it going to go fuck you? Not because you're not a city slicker. He's a farmer himself talking to. Don't like your attitude. Hey Bro, my fucking phone. I could give you a deal. Come over here. I could, I, I not to make A. I know what you're saying. What people. The real problem with factory farm is the lack of moral standards, like when they shove these chickens, these little boxes. And the other thing is we've adapted to the ecosystem that we operate under and the ecosystem that we operate under. We get free food basically. Yeah. Not Free Food, but a lot of protein.

Speaker 1:          01:28:15       Yeah, but it's, it's everywhere. The food is just coming in and the eggs are everywhere, so someone's got to be able to make all those eggs, so we sort of develop these areas and stacked them up with people based on the idea that it's easy to get food here. It was really hard to get food here in the 18 hundreds. It'd be 1500 people here, right? Yeah. It would be like the desert, but as people desert people live there. Some people that this little ranch here ranch there. Why? Because there's no fucking food man or water. Yeah, there's not a lot there. It's a desert. Right. So because of the fact that we figured out how to be able to feed all these millions and millions and millions of people's. Yeah. Yeah. Well in this one little spot like la in particular where no one's growing, shit, everything shoved in there in terms of humans and they're just pumping eggs in there left and right. Yeah. They've sort populated that place

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       based on this ridiculous idea of the access to meet. It's not a ridiculous idea. It's actually a reality. Right, right. But then people come along and they see a peta video and then they go, hey, but you still want to live here, so while you're going to have to go vegan then, well guess what? If you do that, they're going to have to chop down a lot of fucking trees and start growing food everywhere. They're going to have to put it everywhere. All these people are going to be Vegan, all 2 million in this town and 6 million in the neighborhood town and then $20 million in la. A lot of agricultural runoff and pollution. You're going to have a lot of fucking shit go into the ground. You're going to have a lot of combines chewing up rabbits and rats, ground nesting birds. Everything's. Everything's going to get buzzed up.

Speaker 2:          01:29:42       When you gathering up all that grain, you're going to need to feed all those 2 million people that don't have access to animal protein anymore. That's not good either. Right? We're fucked is what I'm saying. You're giving up that easy. I give up. I think technology is allowing us to grow more food on less land. So that's true. I think I'm very hopeful for that. Um, uh, artificial meat, that meat, they're growing very hopeful for that because if we could figure out a way to make it healthy to get that kind of meat, you would still have population control problems and I think I would never stop hunting because of that. But it's, it's meat without a central nervous system. Eat without a central nervous system and we could probably, if it's done and it really works. I mean there's a lot of ifs there, but we could probably eliminate most of the factory farming.

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       The real problem would be like, what would you do with all those cows? What do you do with the cows now? They would die off and then you wouldn't have, but you don't want them to go extinct, you know, have some cows because there'll be people who it'd be a whole marketplace of eating meat with the central nervous system. Just watch, I'll do it. Definitely is natural. We go back to the. There's always going to be a marketplace for eating food as it quote unquote occurred naturally. Which of course Holstein cows are not [inaudible]. The other thing I was going to get to the problem with letting them go, if we ever let them go, they morph sort of like the same way pigs morph. They become this thing called scrub bulls. You ever heard of scrub bowls? It's a really, uh, it's really popular. Especially in Australia.

Speaker 2:          01:31:14       They're wild cattle cattle really broken through fences and lived many, many generations in the wild men. The males are super aggressive. Very dangerous. Jamie, let me see. Yeah, they're dangerous. Is Fuck enormous. Enormous bull. They're not afraid of lions. Afraid of water buffalo. They can climb a tree. When you see a water buffalo. Well, my friend Adam Green tree who shot that buffalo above the flag and I'm in the north lands. That's a scrub bull. So you see how weird that thing looks? It looks weird because it's probably lived in the wild for many, many, many generations. They're huge. Look at the size of the sack on him. Dude, look at his sack and look at his hog. Holy Shit. Things. No joke. That thing is laying pipe all day. Just just banging all these cows

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       did. They're enormous wild cows and they're very aggressive. The males in particular will fuck you up because they're not steers. Right? There are bowls. When we're getting steak, you're getting steak most of the time from a a steers and animal. They cut the balls off of it when it's young. These are full as bowls with the muscles on that. That animal look at the size of that. That thing's huge. Jesus. Yeah. These are big fucking wild bulls. You know, what does that weigh? Eighteen hundred pounds or some shit. Oh Man. Fuck. So that would happen in America. You got to recognize that if people stopped having domestic cattle and they just let those cattle roam through, you would have a devastating impact on the ecosystem just like you have with wild pigs. It would be similar. You'd have one. You have those cows would all be euthanized or they be eating and then maybe it's, it's, it's blinding the cows, but you'd have to have a certain population of them that we keep alive what it needed for milk, you know, can milk them if they come up with artificial mill.

Speaker 1:          01:33:04       Goddammit. Joe. Fuck. You're not really supposed to drink milk though, right? I mean not really, but cheese is good. Shit. Is it though? I drink. I cheese and I drink wine. It doesn't make me feel good and I'm never stopping. How about that one does not make me feel good until it goes in my mouth. The problem is if I, if I like I was in that makeup chair and you drink in one I was doing now was puffy in the morning and I looked at the makeup woman and I said, I think and I said, why? Why am I so puffy in the morning? And she goes, are you drinking at nine ago? Every night? She goes, well, don't do that. If you have to shoot the next day, you might not want to drink three glasses of wine because I get swollen. Just drink it. Yeah, but I want to know. Do you want to look good? Dairy reinvented, sustainable kind. Delicious. There you go. Animal Free Milk. I bet that thing gives. You can lock it. Farts. Farts that if you were at a a chair with wheels on it, you could partner with. Scoot you across a carpet.

Speaker 1:          01:34:10       I mean, how could your body want? Digest that. What's that stuff made outta? Give me some ingredients on Jamie. Weird people are weird. Milk Almond milk. That's my favorite son. Even. Yeah. There's no almond entities that's not almond milk. So whenever a joke like that, that's someone's joked. I just bite someone's joke. I don't think so. The whole almond milk thing is so weird. You're just soaking nuts and then getting the dirty water. They know what it's like. It's like when you a eat coco pops cuckoo for cocoa puffs and you would have that chocolate in there. Would that be the chocolate? No. Bottom. Press them. God it. What are you talking about? They stay, they take the almonds, they soak them, they sprout them, right, but then they press them. Right, but that dirty water, it's just water. The almonds were soaking around it? No, because they don't do it that way, I don't think. I think

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       the way they do it as they crushed the almonds after they've been. After they had been soaked, they take the skin off and then they. They crushed them and then they mix it. They crushed them and then they press them and it creates like a milky. It's dirty water. I don't know what kind of fucking almond factor when you're talking about bro. It's dirty. Almond water. What is your. I'm genetically engineered yeast. What does, what is this? This is. What's the cellular ag? What? Vegan milk. It's called. Oh my God. The term genetically. Wow. The team used genetically engineered yeast to pro produce six key proteins. Oh God. Damn motherfucker. Six key proteins that provide the texture and plants to harvest ate fatty acids that contribute to the flavor. Finally they add sugars, minerals, and water. Easy peasy. It's sugar. With this straightforward recipe, the composition can be modified to leave potentially harmful components such as cholesterol and hormones out of the equation.

Speaker 2:          01:35:59       Kind of lactose cholesterol by the way, the building blocks of all cells. Yeah. Isn't lack sugar. Google that back there. Yeah, they're putting sugar in there, man, but they said they put sugars in it because otherwise it would taste like donkey piss. Yeah. East. By the way, east is a life form. Where do you draw the line? Like if you're a Vegan and you're eating yeast, you are eating a living thing. You're eating a life form that if you didn't eat it, it would replicate. It's not a plant. It's a life form. [inaudible] like if you're. If you're eating probiotics, like say if you're a Vegan, you eating probiotics, you are eating a little tiny light forms. That's what you're eating. When you have fermented that you're letting animals grow on your food and you're eating your food and the animals, so like that's where I get my protein.

Speaker 2:          01:36:49       You're eating animals, you're eating little tiny, tiny little animals. I think one, 10, 10, nine out of 10 of your cells are not human. They're bacteria. Every cell of your body is made from it, and all of your steroid hormones, hormones are synthesized from cholesterol, including all of the sex and adrenal hormones. Well, you definitely don't want that in your body. Then do you. Why would you want something that's responsible for every fucking cell in your body? Like this idea that, that diet is better for you is so Goddamn cockamamie. They're telling you that they're putting in sugar so that it makes it palatable and taking you. You don't have to worry about that naughty cholesterol that's responsible for every fucking cell in your body and your hormones. We don't want that. Have it. They're not even paying attention to science, but it's a belief system.

Speaker 2:          01:37:37       It's not. It's like, here's what it is though. Here's where it gets weird. The, this is, uh, I also believe in many ways is a left right thing that the left believes in climate change science wholeheartedly, 100 percent, but does not believe in gender is gender size. No, that's all bullshit. If you, if you, if you talk about the difference between male and female xy chromosomes, they'll shut you down. Did you see bret Weinstein's, his wife? I heard they were hiring Eric Weinstein. No, I'm his wife, heather hiding. She was doing a speech, uh, with James Demore. Uh, they were talking about gender diversity and she's just talking about the difference between males and females. From a scientist point of view. She's a, she's a real biologist, right? People get up and screaming. They're shutting her down there, walking out. They knocked over the sound system. They called her a fascist.

Speaker 2:          01:38:29       Oh, he said he's a Nazi. You're against science, but it's amazing. It's amazing. So dumb. But it's this thing, this left right thing to. It's right. It's like the left. Once you do 100 percent buy into whatever science they accept, but also they don't buy into a lot of shit that just doesn't fit with whatever their ideology I left. Isn't the cultural purity the far right's into racial period? Yeah, but it was the denial of sciences and new thing. Yes. It's denial of science was just not a part of the left. The left was always pro science posted, supposedly pro science that the idea was that they were more educated, but as I looked into it, I felt it was like, that's not really true, but you would think that it would be more educated because they can. Is it left and right or is it just.

Speaker 2:          01:39:14       Is it, is it. Are we talking about just people who are. I feel like when we talk about these people that are not going to have a sound systems and walking out and shouting that Christine and summers, I don't know that they're right or left. I think that these are young, young, confused people. Shitheads shit. Yeah. I think that I really do. I think they're proud. First of all. I don't think they're very smart. I don't think that that's absolutely true. I think a lot of them might have some psychological problems. I think a lot of them want to belong. I think a lot of them just want to be heard and people do clumsy shit. When people want to feel significant, they'll do even crazier shit, like put a gun in their hand and shoot somebody so sure, you know, and it usually it belongs.

Speaker 2:          01:40:00       It's the realm of young people who don't know what to do with their energy. There's a lot of that. And again, like we talked about before with Christina Hoff summers, there's just a bunch of people that are free from their parents for the first time. That's right. You know, they've only been free for 24 months and they're stretching, they're dyed their hair green. You can't stop me, you fascist and I just, yeah, I just want to stop everything and they want attention. But ultimately I think that this is giving us an opportunity to really fully examine ideas and even though these people shouting people down, all those noises going on, like there'll, there'll be a result. They'll be some sort of an ebb and flow to all this that I feel very hopeful about. Like when I look at the ebb and flow of things, like I like it. I like what's going on. I like that there's a lot of fucking chaos and definitely some people have taken some unsafe unnecessarily bullets and there's definitely some ideas that are getting shut down that shouldn't be and there's definitely some overuse the word Nazi and fascist and all this different stuff, but it seems like overwhelmingly all this crazy energy is being pushed into at least the idea that we're improving the world. Yeah, you know what I'm saying? They want to improve the world.

Speaker 3:          01:41:08       I had a bunch of women on my podcast. We were talking about sexism in Hollywood and of course I was like, I don't see it that much. I was like, I don't say it, and these women were all really intelligent and I said, you know, I gotta be honest man. As a white man now I just feel like I, it's just, it's hard for us. I go, I go, I go, I go, you know, I gotta watch what I say now I've got to watch how I talk. And, and one of the women goes, Katie goes, wow, I can't imagine what that's like one. What's it like to have to watch it? Watch what you say and watch. Watch what your impact is like. I have no idea. Meanwhile she's been dealing with that. Every woman I know has been dealing with that for fucking ever and I guess I didn't take it. I didn't look at their perspective. It's hard to look at other people's perspective. Yeah, it is. It's hard to. Like

Speaker 2:          01:41:50       I was talking to shop in the last podcast we were talking about a Joey Diaz had some crazy shit about some chicks ass and uh, and we were all laughing about it. He was like, it's Joey's fucking Diaz. He's a comedian. I go, I totally understand and I'm with you. But now imagine if you were a regular sized guy and you were dealing with some seven foot tall ogre who was going online talking about how good your asshole smelled. And you're like, oh Jesus. And you knew that that guy wanted to fuck you. And then you knew that if he was alone with you, he could probably like hold you down and fuck you. Like that would be terrifying, right? Yeah, that'd be terrifying. In this case, he's talking about a female fighter. Probably would fuck joey. His ass probably beat Joe. His ass. Bad Ass. You know Joey's not in the best shape. He might. He might call clock

Speaker 3:          01:42:40       punched out. She starts circling, is jagged. She's scared she's going to pepper his face a little bit, but either way he's being funny.

Speaker 2:          01:42:46       That's all it is. But I was saying about. Imagine now though that your a girl who hear someone talk about your asshole like that and we've all done it. We've all done it. Yeah. You'd be like, oh no. Like that's got to be a terrible feeling.

Speaker 3:          01:43:02       Yeah, it is. It's interesting. I'd love to be a woman for one day to see what. That's what you'd like to get fucked. If you're a woman for one day, we just suck a dick. No, wouldn't you like, that's where I draw the line in there. I only want to see where it goes. I just want to see what it's like. Like what does it feel like? Like stuck it in your ass. Like I could have found that out. I was a guy. Well, first of all, what's it like to be attracted to a man like I look at you and I know women find attractive. I don't find you attractive. Beautiful, right area, right? But to have this big kind of a good side, this guy, you got a strong jaw, smaller, strong jaw, smolder God, you do smaller and smaller and smaller. It's hard. It's hard for you to. I get lost in your eyes. You have a strong Johnson.

Speaker 2:          01:43:41       Well, imagine wanting someone to stick something in you and shoot, shoot sperm and two. You can't wait. Get some in me. Yeah, imagine that. Yeah. Jamie just threw up. Yeah. Like

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       my wife was watching Sopranos and she found time sprinter. Attractive when I said why? She goes because he's powerful and he's just bad and he's and, and you know, and I said, well we want to be married to him. She goes, I don't want to be married to him. I want to be as mistress. I was like, what the fuck? God. Leave the room. I know I gotta I got to gain weight. I would make tea and I was think about my life. I got to stop being so shredded. I've got to get into crime and gained some weight instead of being so good. Yeah. Just eat some pasta. So legit and terrific up. Yeah, he died young. That was a bummer. If it's one of those guys that when he died I was like, oh, 55 or 52 or something. Shit. He was in that neighborhood.

Speaker 1:          01:44:30       Looked every bit of 60. Yeah. He had it all in his system to baby. Yeah, he did, right? He had the full ride. He likes to do well. I know guys have worked with them. I know guys well who worked with him and he just. He could fucking tear it up man. Who's the movie though? Played a hitman. What was that movie? True Romance? No, no. Yeah. Was that one but there was a more recent one. I'm God damn it. Was it with Brad Pitt? Was there, moved with him and Brad Pitt killing me softly. Yes. Was he a Hitman to. They were both Hitman, but he was also in the drop. I don't know if you're thinking about that. I'm thinking of killing me softly. That's the one, right? He was great and true romance, man. Fuck. He's great and everything. It was amazing. I mean that Tony Soprano's character literally literally changed gene, what we think of as like a hero in a TV show because all of a sudden the hero was a murderer, like the hero.

Speaker 1:          01:45:23       Like when he killed Christopher, like when they had the car accident, you just fucking smothered him. He's like, this is a good excuse to kill this guy. I just killed him right there. I was like, whoa. Holy Shit. Holy Shit. When he closed his nose. Yeah, man, that was fucked up. There's no class that was fucked up. Yeah, I know. That's what it was like. That's willing to do whatever it took. Yeah, but it was also the star, the movie, The star of the show. And you liked him? Oh yeah. That's what was so genius. There's never been a show like, that is so bad. Look, he was so bad and there's. There hasn't been a show like that since then. I mean, who else is like that much of a villain and a hero wrapped up into one? Who else? What other? What other? The only person that you can maybe breaking bad, but you could see why he was doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:46:22       It wasn't a bad guy. Tony Soprano's was a Hemi badge, cheated on his wife, constantly murdered, killed, but it was the. What was fascinating about him is that it was the dichotomy. It was the guy who loved his family, told the son to do his homework and not to swear at the table and also an order a hit in the same breath. That insane contradiction was what? You can't take your eyes off because we're bipolar reps because you can be a very bad guy and also a really good guy and that's what's. That's what's fucking crazy and true about human beings. Well, that's what's brilliant though about that writing is that they figured out how to encapsulate that in fiction where it's playing out every week and you're not. You're not sick of the guy like you want to. You want to see if he's going to make it.

Speaker 1:          01:47:05       Is he going to get busted? Is he going to jail or they gonna crack down on them. Who's going to rat them out, you know, but that, that shows an interesting like kind of metaphor for life. Like I guess what I really worry about with our social situation today is the destruction of people and how they're never allowed to come back into the fold. That's what I worry about. Like, like public shaming or whatever it might be. Like there are very few people that deserve eternal damnation and they are out there, but for the most part, Roman Polanski. It's a tough, you know, again, a great artist and a great filmmaker on reacting to the fact that you, I can't, I can't justify having you come back to the country and be pardoned after that. If the, if what you did is true. If what I've been, what I've read and been told is true, I don't know how I'm supposed to forgive that so that that's mainly because a child and so that falls into line of unacceptable things for me, but then there's people that have been shamed like Al Franken where you're like, really?

Speaker 1:          01:48:16       No. That was ridiculous. It was ridiculous. What did he do? What I get to the photo was very inappropriate that he took the end. You can't just train him. Funny Weinstein. That cheapens. No, you can't. He shouldn't have done it, but he was trying to be funny and sometimes people try to be funny, especially people are around each other all the time. They get stupid and they, they crossed lines and you know, or you just don't read the signals. You Cross a line in that you're trying to pick somebody up or you're putting pressure on them. Don't you think that ultimately what this is going to do though is people are going to have to learn to be nicer to each other. Don't you think that? Or they're going to be really careful and afraid and I worry that if you have, for example, first of all, where do people, most people meet their wives and their girlfriends?

Speaker 1:          01:49:06       A lot of times it's a work a lot of times, okay, their husbands and their wives and I think that your don't be surprised if corporations start to have a zero tolerance policy for any kind of romance in the office space. It'll be like the military. Nobody's allowed to date anybody and if you do get fired right away, no questions asked, and now think about the fact that your eight hours a day in this place, which is most of your waking hours to make anybody happy. I can make anybody happy. Also, please add the fact that we're also going to have all of the meetings between men and women in rooms videotaped and in fact d and in fact, men and women aren't allowed to be in the same room without a chaperone. Yes, you're going to see all the shit chaperones role because you're talking about major money.

Speaker 1:          01:49:45       You're talking about major fucking. It'd be a robot with a camera. The robot, it says, I think you were speaking inappropriate thing. Exactly. And so you have all these issues, so is that going to make all of us happier? No, we're going to have to quit. Is it going to make us work in offices? We're going to be safer. I'm hoping that it makes people quit offices. So what happens is there will be no sexual harassment at the workplace because there's no workplace. Fuck, I never thought of that dude. Dude, way ahead. You're smarter. We're working together. Not Working together now. That's Kinda why I show up and work together. Fuck. By the way, men and women working together as a pretty new thing in history. Yeah. Men and women boys. Yeah. Men and women have never worked together. Yeah. So this is all kind of like and you know, you know, listen, when men and women get together, people are starting to fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:50:34       Whoa, they're just gonna Fuck Whitney. Cummings was a funny joke about that, but working in the writing room, working on a set of a show like she doesn't usually work like at a place and she's like, oh, this is what people are doing here. Like, yeah, I don't want to give away her joke. It's very funny, but yeah, that's, you know, there's something that's happening when men and women get around each other, they're jockeying for sexual position and they're attracted to each other and they worked together and they ended up liking each other. Yeah. And then they get to know each other at work and. Yeah. And then what happens. Okay. So you can see you can't. So there's no such and there's no romance and there's no humor. Humor is dangerous. Humor can be a problem. What if you say something racist and you're trying to be funny.

Speaker 1:          01:51:14       You get in trouble. Don't do that. You're not racist, but you were just trying to be funny. Right. Okay. But you can say racist things. I'll give you a free pass to say racist things about white people. Well that's fine. I'll give you a free pass. Do you have any racist white things that you could say at work today? Tommy? Yeah. Couldn't they be hillbillies? Yes. Or rednecks. Rednecks. Dirty hillbillies. That's fine. Shit. All over those people that were forced, their whole family worked at a coal mine. Yeah. Hey, how you dummies? Will you fucking your kids? Uh, yeah. It'd be racist all day for white people. You can and there's some white people that do not have a fucking good deal. They don't have a good deal. No. They got $400 in the bank if that. There's some incredible amount of money, uh, or an incredible amount of people rather in this country that have less than that in their bank through.

Speaker 1:          01:52:06       Yeah. There was something like 50 percent, some study they did. People that have $200 or less in their bank account and some insane number like into the millions and millions of people. This is what I always say, that people that voted for trump, you know, a lot of them have been demonized by, you know, the left as being a racist or homophobic or massage seats and stuff like that. Yeah. Or or, or good people who have $400 in the bank or less, can't send their kids to baseball, et cetera. And along comes Hillary Clinton, who's Obama light talking about the same shit. And they were like, I'll try anything but her. Look at this. There you go. That's real. Read that. That's real man. Six in 10 Americans don't have $500 in savings. There you go. Holy Shit. It's way more than I thought it was when you don't have one.

Speaker 1:          01:52:56       Okay, now, now we're back to that. That story about scarcity. Isn't that like a hundred and $50, million people or something like that? Yeah, 60 percent. It's more than. Yeah. So, so how does the, what is the real number of people in America is a 300 million or morning or something at 3:30. Three 30. So it's more than that. Yeah. So, so one 70 170 million people. So when you got $500 a month, are you thinking about gender neutral? Bathrooms? Always. Are you thinking about that? No. Everyone's massages, bro. It's disgusting to be a man and see other men's. I'm just ashamed of my gender. I'm ashamed. All your fucking thinking about is getting my money so you can send your kids to fucking think. Bret Weinstein said that was really interesting about this. Is it better? Eric and Eric? There's brothers. They're brothers. They both been on my podcast.

Speaker 1:          01:53:44       Eric is a mathematician who works for Peter. Teal is the professor from Evergreen College that got the day of absence where they made him quit because there was. There were saying white people need to stay home. Everybody's like, that's so racist. He's also a Jew. The Jews. We super, super, super progressive. It doesn't matter. The Jews didn't exactly have it easy what he was saying. That's interesting. You were saying that this is not just about that. It's also about subordination and that you're seeing this subordination plate that's planning, that's taking place, and then a lot of these men like the way they're behaving, they're behaving to be subordinate there. There. There are being obedience trained, you know, and they're. They're giving into it to show that you shouldn't punish me because I'm on your side because they were terrified of the women that are wielding this power now, but I got up in the air building that wild.

Speaker 1:          01:54:35       I've got a theory about that. Brilliant men. Historically, when you create a bunch of quiet resent and it turns into allowed violence, men are really good at. You've got to be careful about make a masculine men a wholesale because I always worry that it's very easy to whip them up when you got the right circumstances and the right leader and men like to organize and they liked to fight and they like to fight back and that's what makes them feel significant when they've been emasculated and I don't think it's, you know, that's the expression. Punishment doesn't change behavior. It just suppresses it. Well. Do you know that in the turn of the century, I'm not this one, but the last, there was a giant bachelor culture in America where men just didn't. They had just gotten through like a lot of it was like in the twenties to like an after the depression. It was like the burden of having a family was just too much. It wasn't attractive to them and there was a bunch of men that gravitate towards pool halls and in

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       19 early 19 hundreds of New York City, there was more than 900 pool halls in New York City to just stop and think of that more than 900 pools and there's all these men that would just go there and they would hang out and they were like, fuck that life, and they just didn't want to have a part of it because it was too brutal. It was too hard. They're all this country would need for this thing to flip on its fucking ass. All they would need is legalized prostitution and guys would be like, wait, hold up, wait a minute, hold on, hold on. I definitely love you. I'd definitely love you, but wait a minute, wait a minute. What am I signing? What is this? If if people found out that they could just get sex anytime they wanted, if they had $100, like if you have $100, you can get sex and you get sex and a pretty girl and it's clean.

Speaker 2:          01:56:33       You don't have to worry about it. People would be outraged. Like, well, how am I going to have power over this man? If I can't control his sex, I could only. I only have him locked. Otherwise we're just friends. See if we're just friends, I can't have half his money. I can't tell him what to do. I can't tell him when to be home, but let me ask you a question. We have to live together and I have to control his sex. If we live together and then I control his sex, then I have all this power. But if they were in a situation where legalized prostitution was just like grocery stores or it's just everywhere. What would the first of all, the amount of hose would probably be the same. It's like used to be a lot richer. Now they're just doing it like under the table.

Speaker 2:          01:57:13       It's hard to get away with it. They can get rated as sneakiness. There's all this, you know, the gold diggers instead of hose. Some girls would just go straight into heroin. Yeah. But here's my question. Do you think men are more interested in sex or admiration? There's both. They want to be fake admiration from the hose. Yeah, but they say with all due respect, no, it's fake though. Like I think men can do want to be admired more than anything else they do. They do. They want their dick to be the biggest. Even if it's a mushroom cap, just make all the noise please and let me know I'm King Kong and that's why. And you stick to the woman. A lot of times you'll stick that one woman who you know has got your back no matter what you're talking about. A guy who finds that there's a lot of people that don't find that in for them.

Speaker 2:          01:57:57       Legalized prostitution right next to Bolero. Hop on in Chanera go sandwich Dick, suck. Get a grilled cheese and tomato soup kitchen. Like it would change. Like what people like why, why are you dating? Are you dating specifically for sex or dating because you want companionship, like are you too consumed with work and are you busy all day and you just like to hang out with your friends but you get horny? Yeah, because we have a solution for you. And if that was the case. I'm not saying that relationships wouldn't be the same, but I'm saying is there's a lot of relationships that wouldn't be the same too. I think you're onto something like my buddy Steve, he blew it. He was like, he would have stayed in jail if he had access to women because he was hanging out with all his friends. He

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       was like, it was the fucking best best because all we do is fuck around and laugh all day, lift weights, and you know, he just did food kind of sucks, but you're all laughing and you're all in a shitty situation. Situations. Everybody gets along. He goes, if I had girls, if I had access to women, I would not have left. That's hilarious. This is in Fort Dix to like, you know, the biggest federal penitentiary in the world.

Speaker 2:          01:59:03       I'm obviously torn on prostitution because I don't want anybody that I know kids or my kids to go into prostitution, but I also don't think anybody should tell people that something that's completely legal to do for free is illegal to charge money for. Yeah. Like there is some gay male escort that came out today. Uh, there was, I put it on my twitter about like, just let these fucking people have sex. Like some gay male escort was talking about the priests at the Vatican and he's like, naming names. I fuck that guy. I fucked him. I fuck pan. He wants us, my dad, him and you know, they was talking about them being hypocritical. Like, yeah, there are definitely hypocritical. Let these fucking people have sex. This is crazy. Like your, your system doesn't work. Yeah. If they just let them have sex and let them have male escorts, just leave them alone. Say That's fine. Just as long as you do. You believe in Jesus still. Yeah. Just like Dick, I believe in Jesus, but I love Dick. Okay, well Jesus must've put that love for Dick in you. Jesus. Put that love for our truth. Sure. Right. It must have been. The truth is

Speaker 3:          02:00:11       it's a complicated thing, right? Because then where do you. So, so like we had these urges and a lot of them are not very productive, right? So you want to have sex with all, you want to have sex with everybody you can or whatever it might be, but you know, that's not viable because there are just certain trade offs

Speaker 2:          02:00:28       do that. Well, you know, the, the viable alternatives x Mokena you have these ai robot fuck dolls that live in your house, but the problem is they probably get too smart than they kill your real wife. You know the algorithm. Yeah. And they figured out a way to convert your sperm into babies. They just, they've figured out a way to create an actual digital wound. Could idea for from movie dude. Well it's x Monkey Manchino that movie. Did you see that now? Oh my God. It's one of my all time favorite. Yeah. I want to top top 20 all time. Favorite movies. I'm obsessed with Black Mirror. It's an hour and 45 minute black mirror. X market is amazing. Yeah, I do love Black Mirror. It's awesome. But x market is actually even more intense. It's a really well done movie about Ai and uh, it's, it has very few cut the shit scenes.

Speaker 2:          02:01:17       Like when you're, when you're watching it, you're like, whoa. Like all of this could be possible in a hundred percent. Yeah. Yeah. It's really good. I want to tell you anymore. It's really good to watch it. Yeah, it's, it's the shit. And it's also. Yeah. That would be the move. What do you think? It's so fun. It's going to eat us. You think what I think? How about this? Um, Boston makes those fucking robots that you can't kick over. Do you know those things? Yeah. And they, they are funded by Darpa and Darpa makes a robot called the eater robot e a t our robot and the eater robot literally eats biological material. I'll spell that out for you. It's fucking people. It eats dead people on the battlefield to fuel itself. It is an actual working concept of a fucking robot that eats dead people for fuel.

Speaker 2:          02:02:11       Yes. E a t o will. It can eat hay and maybe sticks and rabbits. Maybe delete a rabbit. It's going to eat people you fuck way, way autonomous tactical robot eater project. Uh, it's from a Darpa. It's. Yeah. What's Darpa you highlighting there? What's dark? Oh, it's a video. So I'm looking at the cursor doing that. I'm like, why are you highlighting Darpa? Darpa is. I forget the something research. It's all military shit. Darpa is a robot. Yes. Yeah, it's a real thing. Yeah. It's a real thing that the same people that are making those Boston dynamic robots, you just see the one recently that it bounces. It pulls up to the side of a wall and then bounces over the wall like 13 feet in the air. No lands on top of a building. It could land on the roof of a building. Come on from the bottom and hop all the way up to the second story.

Speaker 2:          02:03:05       Building two story building. It leaps literally from the ground all the way to the top itself. It's on wheels, so it writes itself perfectly every time. That's so fucking, dude. It's so bananas and all this stuff is happening. Like while people are paying attention to Kim Kardashian's ass. Even Jamie, Jamie's like, oh, Kim Kardashian called out the easy mafia today. Like, did you like her? You like her a camera dash, and he is. He loves celebrity gossip and upset of how I met your mother and she was there and we were. We were like, her dressing room was right next to mine that she was on set and she didn't look like what I thought she was. She didn't have any makeup. She's pretty and all, but it was just like, I didn't even know that I was hurt. I was like, I think that's Kim Kardashian. I'm not sure.

Speaker 2:          02:03:47       It's a. she's a person. She's. We've made a bizarre choice to spend a tremendous and me included spend a tremendous amount of talent, tremendous, tremendous amount of time thinking about a person that really doesn't do a thing. Like they just live like that's what's weird. It's like she, they've tapped into this extreme desire for gossip and some weird, crazy way where they do all these wacky things with life where you can't take your eyes off of them and they always have something new going on, but they don't do anything. So now she got wise though and married a guy who does other thing. She'd married Kanye West, right? He's a giant cultural thing. Yeah. So then now it becomes more legit. Now the whole empire is like really solidified, like they've added some fucking sand. It's ambition, ambition. It's just like this strange. It's definitely that.

Speaker 2:          02:04:35       There's ambition, but there's also this. They've figured out how to Juke the system. They figured out how to Shuck and jive and make their way in with no singing, no dancing, no comedy into money. I think I have money, but what do you do? Anything different than you did like besides not worry so much about what a car is going to cost, but what do you do that's luxurious? I don't really do much, man addressed. Those are dress I know address normal work. I work out, I go running. What do you do? Is there any advice you'd like hunting on advice though? That's where I get my. Maybe this is what I mean is like I don't spend. Right. I have my standup. I like to box. I like to uh, you know, the things I do don't take that much money. They take a lot of time and energy.

Speaker 2:          02:05:19       I think if you wanted to travel and you wanted to go on some big time adventures, which I have decided I'm really interested in doing some adventure. Some your especially hunting adventures. I like to go to New Zealand, New Zealand. We should go to his farm. I would love to. I'd love to go to. I want to bow hunt in Alaska and the Yukon wild coats on his property there. Wild. Huh? Go. I don't know, but there are wild. He's got his New Zealand's insane. New Zealand is really like an experimentation in um, invasive species because everything is invasive. They have red stag that are from Europe and they have all these axes. Actually, I don't know if they have access to. He's got huge red stag on his property that shoots their clearance. They have some immense animals there and they don't have any predators, so they have these crazy seasons where you could just shoot things all the time.

Speaker 2:          02:06:07       Oh, there's a while. Go look at a cool horns on that thing, man. That's what he should fuck. That's amazing. Look at that thing. I know. It's like the ripples of a jelly fish when it's in the water. You want to go? We can go look at that fucking thing. That's a New Zealand Wild Goat, Huh? Yeah. Wow. Those horns are beautiful. Look at the code on that thing. What are the amazing animal? I know they're smart. I was watching a thing online about these guys that were hunting for big horn sheep, you know, and there were uh, in the rocky mountains hunting for rocky mountain bighorn sheep with a bow and arrow. And I was looking at these things and I'm like, what a crazy animal. You remember we saw them and we're in Montana. And rinella was pointing out the size of their balls.

Speaker 2:          02:06:52       Yes, because they have like church bell balls. Do they have, they're so athletic to keep each other in the balls. They do. They kick each other in the balls when they were living there, like be jockeying for attention. They had buddy each other, which is why they have those antlers in the first place and then they walk up behind each other and lift their feet up and kick each other in the balls. I didn't see that constantly. They crash into each other though. It's incredible dude. And they're so athletic. I was up in Bisque, big whiskey mountain in Wyoming and me and my buddy hiking and he discussed, he just pointed at and they were just seven of them. I wrote with them and they are fucking huge there. Three hundred pounds. Yeah. Giant animals. Yeah. Look at these fuckers. Look at what a cool animal too. Like when you look at the things, got some balls, the horns on their head.

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       We're the sack. Once they collide, look at his sack on the right just swinging. How crazy did they don't have any head trauma while they're probably dumb as fuck. I mean seriously. What do they have to do? I smell mountain lion. They're not doing algorithms. Yeah, their food is right in front of her fucking stupid face all the time. Here it goes. Boom. And they snap into it too. It's not like they're running into their head down there. They're putting all this extra emphasis in. They're trying to make it uncomfortable for the other dude. The crazy thing is when you see two bucks and they're orange get tied up together. That's crazy. But what's crazy about this is that they pause afterwards so they must get their bell rung.

Speaker 2:          02:08:18       Right? But look, they just stand there and they back up like no one is like, bitch, I hit you again and now hit you with again. You're right, right. Watch what they do. Take a days, didn't find a bucket, must be lunches. Boom. And then they built. They're both like, what is happening here? Oh Jesus. They turned to sideways. Almost like the one. Ignore the fact that the guys there. Wow, look at this guy. I wonder if they see cool shit. Like, look, what else? You butterflies and fairies. Fairies. His came up off the ground. Do they hit each other so hard, but they just stop. Look, they hit each other and then they just chill out. When you're getting off on it, it's like they're getting some kind of a high. I wonder if anybody's ever observed like a wonder if there'd be a way to measure like certain neuro transmitters on them, like inaction, like let them collide with each other and then figure out like what happens to the brain.

Speaker 2:          02:09:19       I guess there's some burst of happiness that comes out of that. They talk about this in concussion where the where they don't suffer from brain trauma or cte. Actually they don't get. You think that they would, but male, the male rams don't have science and so the brain is designed different than our same as a woodpecker. Woodpecker is brain and fuck it, they were in my garden are there. The physiology of the skull was the both, but the way their brain is attached to the inside of the skull is different. Our brains like barely attached our brains. Like someone who's like not worried about anything bad going wrong. Well, it's all gelatinous, like our spinal cord goes brain and it's all one big sort of gelatinous mass, right? Yes. Well we're just not sturdy, you know, we're just so weak in comparison to other animals like you, you know what it's like, like you remember when you shot your deer in Montana and we were um, we were cleaning it and addressing it and we're pulling on the skin.

Speaker 2:          02:10:13       You're grabbing that which, which a lot of people turn into jackets and pants and shit. That's the native Americans just make clothes on them and you're grabbing that hide and you're thinking, oh, this is so thick. Like this shit is strong. You're pulling on it and then grab your bitch ass scale. We have toilet paper scan, nick it and it's a process, you know, while we were cleaning that animal, what were, um, when you were doing the ravine comer. I remember I sliced my finger open, just touched my finger with the blade and my fingers squirting all over the place. Meanwhile, I've got to really dig in to get to this meet. I gotta really cut through all this skin. It's so hard. Yeah, and then you get an infection, like if you got a blister on your foot and you're in the wilderness, you know who you're fucked, you're fucked.

Speaker 2:          02:11:01       You got a lot of guys get because they were new boots that go, oh, I'll go through new boots going hiking is awesome. And then your features get. Fuck what bitches. We are on the cold too. We can't handle the call. I've got some negative messages. I member on twitter when the episode of mediator came out when you and I were uh, in Montana and I was like, don't blow into being comfortable. It's the cool though. You focus. This is poor woodsmanship. Like, Hey, poor woodman's ship. Let's. Hey, I'm not a good woodsmen. I'm a pussy. It's 90 degrees outside. You don't want. You just want me to suck it up. Does that make you feel better if I just suck it up? How about if I say it sucks and then I suck it up. Hunting. Camping here. You shaking. I can hear you shivering in the morning, right here, putting on your socks and you go get almost yourself camping.

Speaker 2:          02:11:52       Blow. Do you know what doesn't blow when the campaign is over the best? Like you have the best showers ever. We have great. We have the greatest time to though. It's fast. So much fun because we laugh so hard. I think Rinella wants to go to Mexico with us. I want to go. Okay. Let's like you guys don't invite me anymore. I want to do. I told them. I told him the next one to come because we did one where we struck out we win a bow hunting for deer in Arizona. Not Arizona. Excuse me. In Nevada last, uh, I think it was August. Nothing struck out. Was it cold or very hot? Very hot. 100 degrees. Real? Yeah. Yeah. So hot that if you shot an animal, there's a real concern about getting the meat back to camp as quickly as possible. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:12:38       It's fucking hot. Tj dillashaw Tommy. He was up in the mountains of a Nevada in Nevada. And it was super cold though. Yeah. That was like, what time of year? Yeah, he was probably in a different season and maybe for elk, you know, like he was a nice thing. It was a deer. Well, there's a, there's always a bunch of seasons too, right? There's like early archery, which is what we were doing, which is where the animals are in velvet, so they've just finished growing their horns and they're starting to scrape the velvet, which is the outer skin off of the bone. I didn't even know until really recently that antlers are literally bone and an elk antler. Like those antlers right there. That's the fastest growing bone in the wild kingdom. Wow. The fastest growing thing in nature, those antlers fall off every year. Every year they weigh 30 pounds.

Speaker 2:          02:13:27       Wow. Holy Shit. Yeah. They're like 15 pounds each side. The bone and it grows in a couple of months. What? Yup. Goes quick. Yeah. Like, see if you could find a video. Do you see any, um, uh, growth of a elk antlers were when you were in Nevada, like in 100 degree heat? Did you see any other animals? Okay. Yeah. Someone saw an elk. Um, uh, we saw, we saw some, a lot of like jack rabbits and stuff like that. They have a lot of rabbits. You have to be really careful with the rabbits too. Like if you, if you kill one and skin one, they have little mites and shit that will give you infections that you can die from. Lack, like legitimately see antlers. Well, antlers are growing. They're covered in fuzzy skin called velvet. Yeah, that's what they look like in their environment.

Speaker 2:          02:14:11       Is that what you still get that little quick look? A quick as mass human growth hormone in it or. I mean like. Yes, yes, the velvet from the antlers. A lot of football players were taking it because it actually lets you grow growth hormone. So look, you could see it April eighth, then the April Fifteenth, and then April 22nd. Look how quick that Shit's growing. That's crazy. That's crazy. Seven days later. It's longer. Look at that. May sixth. It's fucking gigantic now. That's nuts. Look at that. May Thirteenth, May 20th a week late like a mushroom, a week later. His past as a fucking mushroom. That is crazy. A week later after that and it's all value. That's nuts. That is nuts. July first. Look at that just a couple of months. July eighth, July 15th. Look at the size of that thing. Okay. This must be a commercial elk farm that we're looking at because these elk are so big, like their antlers are so big that that seems like it seems like, um, like they're feeding in something.

Speaker 2:          02:15:09       It'd be hard to get that many pictures of the same one too. Yeah. Yeah. That must be. So. Let me just pause. Pause right there. Yeah, it is. If you saw that elk in the wild, you would shut your fucking pants. That would be the boulevard bowls. If its antlers. Look at the size of the antlers on that thing. That thing has like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine points on one side. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. It's a nine by nine. That's crazy. Craziest. Not Have Antlers. No. They don't have antlers, but every now and then a dear female has antlers. Hmm. Yeah. Some freak bitch just likes to fight fucking some bull dyke sort of dikey. Dykey doe just grows them. Antlers. Yeah. Some gunshot one recently. And they were all confused. It was white. It was a, it was a female rather. And had a antlers. They're like, what is this? Yeah, but that should grows every year. People go shit on to Mexico. I don't know, maybe deer. There's a lot of deer in Mexico. So Nora. So Nora has a lot of mule deer. Dangerous though, aren't there a bunch? Don't be scared.

Speaker 2:          02:16:19       They're not going to fuck with you. What you gotta worry about is uh, I mean if you would go to their towns and caused problems, you went to just say no to drugs. They're busy making drug money. They don't have time to go looking for some asshole. Shoot a deer. And there's branches that you go to out there were there, they'd normally they're hunting ranches. That's why people go there in the first place. And that would probably be like where you park your stuff and you drive in from Arizona to Cancun. And one of the guys who's there and wealth do guy, and I said, what about the cartels? He goes, they own a lot of these resorts to your money for them, they don't worry about the cartels. And I've talked to a guy with this amazing restaurant and I said, what about the cartels?

Speaker 2:          02:17:02       And they said they'd come here and I said, wait a minute. This does show up in a bunch of SUV is they come, they tip, they say, thanks. I go, they don't like extort money. No. The only time that happens is if you're selling drugs out of your restaurant. If you're selling drugs out of your restaurant, they want a piece. Otherwise you're fine. It's all ingrained. It's all like a whole business you say. Yeah, it's a business. Yeah. Um, I was in Punta Mita and we took these golf carts. They let us take these golf carts to town. We're staying at this resort. And you, you could, you leave the resort and when you leave the resort there is a stark contrast. Yes sir. From safety and beautifully manicured lawns and landscaped grounds to we get out. We are maybe 100, 200 yards from the outside and we see a military base.

Speaker 2:          02:17:56       It's a very small military base with two guys with bulletproof vests, helmets on holding. I don't know what kind of fucking high powered rifle are behind a metal plate that's attached to the top of a jeep. So they literally area in like riot war type vehicle. Yeah, fully armed, ready to go. So if anything went wrong right over there, they drive in so they're protecting this resort and I realized like protective is sword. That's what it's for. They're there to protect all these wealthy people from Europe and America and wherever the fly in stay at this resort. And I was like Whoa, this is crazy because it makes sense. I mean why else would that be there? It's there and they're like waiting outside the gate. There's a, there's a, there's a great deal to be said about having institutions you can trust like courts that can enforce contracts that are not corruptible.

Speaker 2:          02:18:52       So in this country, if you buy a house, that piece of paper actually means something. And most countries not so much. It's your private property, but somebody with a bigger guy come and take it from me as we can decide you did something wrong and they have to take it. Yeah, and that is the fundamental difference between our countries still and a lot of other countries, including Mexico and someplace. Well, that's what happened to that McAfee guy in. Where was it that he was at? Was it Costa Rica? Where was he? No, somewhere else that you remember. That guy, the McAfee guy that came up with that virus software and then he went bananas and moved to some other country, some tropical country. What happened to as well? They accused him of murder. Was it billy's? They accused him of murder and he had to flee the country and they took his land and he was like, Hey, they're their railroad in me.

Speaker 2:          02:19:39       I gotta get the fuck out of here. We actually talked to him on the podcast when he was on the Lam. He called me up on the phone and I did an interview with him on the lamb. It's what happens. Yeah, he was a. He gets. He's living in America now, but he's like a bonafide wild man, like he denied these reports that there's a forum where someone was taking photos of method they were making and explaining how their re-engineering meth and making it better. And uh, they were saying that it was him, that he was the one who was doing that. He, so he's in beliefs get some fucking lab in his backyard. He denied the whole thing. So I don't know if it's true or not true. I think he said he was trolling like, okay, maybe. Right. Remember that Jamie. It was something connected to like bath salts, like he figured out how to reengineer bath salts and make them better people.

Speaker 2:          02:20:28       Can you know what's going to happen if you take. Nobody took. Nobody had a lot of problems and then took some meth and they got better. Here's my question though. How many people are doing math right? And we just don't hear about it. Yeah. Meth labs and dead dogs. So the founder of McAfee antivirus went on the run and believes Meth, meth labs. And it was about the dogs. When it say what? Scroll back and dead dogs. Oh, okay. Dead Dogs. I don't know the story. He says he was trolling about the meth labs, but it's entirely possible. That dude was just part is as often believes somebody wind up accusing somebody of murder and I think they wanted to question him and he was like, fuck, you think I'm gonna? Move back to America. I tried this out. It's not fun guys. Yeah. I'll just blog about you for a couple of years.

Speaker 2:          02:21:17       What's he do for money? He started McAfee antivirus. I'm sure he's got millions of dollars. They took a lot of his cash though. That's a huge problem. That's the problem with Russia and a lot of countries when when like the ruling elite has the power to do whatever they want, including kill you. You guys take your house. It's this double agent in England today. London. He and his daughter are gravely ill. Been poisoned. Yeah. There were. There were secret agent against Russia, right? Yeah. Double agents I guess. Don't do that. Well, you're gonna you're gonna die. Yeah. That seems like a bad job. Secret agent against Russia. That's a risky fucking job. Did you see it, Chris? Have you seen that? Yes, I have. Boy. One a Oscar for that Disney did and well deserved. Well deserved. We know where that Russian scientists. I love that guy. That guy is under protection. He is right now under protective custody somewhere where they're worried about him being assassinated. They they took. Not only did they take all of his money, they took away his wife's house. They did? Yeah. They. They're trying to turn his family. Homeless. I think they're trying to pressure him into going back to Russia and giving

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       himself up by making his family essentially homeless. Yeah. They're putting tremendous pressure on him so he can't get his wife out or anything. Or Gregory. What is his last name? Gagarin. He doesn't as well, but I would have gotten wiser apparently. He. She didn't want to listen. She didn't want to come. He was already out of the country and he didn't. She didn't want to listen to him and she didn't understand that he had been. They were listening to his phone calls and emails that she didn't have a way. He didn't have a way of expressing to her like, hey, you've gotta get the fuck out now. Like if you did that, they would have just come and scooped her up.

Speaker 1:          02:23:05       No due process. Rod Shanoff Gregory watching off the head of the Russian anti-doping laboratory. It's an amazing documentary folks. If you haven't seen it, it's on Netflix man. But it just shows you what it could be like in other countries. They don't play by the rules. There's no rules. He who has the power makes the rules. That's right. You're, you're dealing with the mafia basically organized bad. Yeah. And there's a lot of people that love it to be like that here. Oh, they would love it. I know. And they don't because they have no idea of what history is about. Here's the thing, if you want to use this, if you, if you, if you want to be, if you don't want to believe in things like due process, right? Um, integrity of courts and all those things, uh, if you don't want to, if you don't want to believe that you should have a right to criticize your government.

Speaker 1:          02:23:57       I know what works for you right now because the person in power is on your side, but you're next. You're next. As soon as the tables flip and the table's always flip, so you are historically ignorant. There is a reason that the founding fathers thought through these things. They came from tyranny and uh, the, the genius of the founding fathers was there's those checks and balances and representative government. And it's such a radical idea that our leaders are basically are they serve at our whim? Now that's all changing. Lawrence lessig you need to have on the podcast who wrote republic last. I talk about them all the time. Lawrence lessig will tell you right now. He's a, he's a, he's at Harvard University. He's a law professor. And he said, your government does not represent. You have the Gerrymander districts where there are all these districts are gerrymandered.

Speaker 1:          02:24:46       You know what that means. So the congressional districts are essentially, they're redrawn so that they favor one party or another. Do you understand? So demographics, so a million Republicans in Massachusetts as well, not vote. They're never going to win. They're just not represented. Because the districts are so gerrymandered that it's always going to be typically a democrat. That's one example. Okay. Of the 435 seats in Congress, the ones that aren't chairman and the ones that are actually where your vote actually counts there, about 35 of those seats, about 35 of the 40, 35. I think that's the number. Just keep this in mind to every fucking congressmen that you know spends 30 to 70 percent of his or her time calling for money raising funds and they do sent 30 to 70 percent of their time. That's insane. And they do it. And this has been well documented in republic last and so damn much money.

Speaker 1:          02:25:48       There are some very good books that I've read on this. I've had less sick on my podcast. Why's he got to have him on because he's a fucking important. I'd be happy to. He's so important to listen to. And he had his spells name Lawrence lessig s l e s s I g and he does an amazing job. He's got a great ted talk. You can listen to her for 20 minutes. That's all it is, and just listen to him talk about how democracy doesn't work the way it does with money in politics now, and he talks about campaign. We just so when you didn't say campaign finance, reform everybody's zones out that those words are exhausting. I'm like, oh Jesus. But he opens the book with this fucking amazing, thorough quote and he talks about if you want to talk about the problems in this country and our democracy and this thorough quote is, I see men everywhere hacking at the branches of evil while none are striking at the root.

Speaker 1:          02:26:36       It's a great fucking quote, right? Him Throw Hudson good ones. Yes, he had some good ones because that, those, some of those data and my, my other favorite mark twain quote, a loyalty to my country, always to my government only when it deserves it. It's two really cool quotes, but you know, he does a really good job of saying that 35 seats really matter and those are the only ones that matter with those districts worth voting. You know, where it makes sense to vote, where if you're, if you're a republican or a Democrat, where that, where that to contested seat, but then those, those concussions, congressional, you know, candidates or those ones were in Qa or in the, in the seat's already. They have to raise money to stay in power. So they're talking to their donors and their fundraisers are the ones that are telling them what kind of issues they better hit on if they want the big donors.

Speaker 1:          02:27:23       That's so crazy. It's a crazy system. You know what's interesting though, the system has affected the place where we came from. Like what if the United States didn't take off from Europe? What if we didn't bail and start this thing up over here? What would it be like over there? Because what it was like over there was a bunch of kings and queens and shit and had been like that forever. That's right. And now now it's kind of, they have a queen, but it's bullshit. You know, there's one prince was getting married that, you know, people who seem to give a fuck about. I don't get it. You know, George George Washington said right when they wanted to make him king, he said, I didn't fight this revolutionary war to become George the second and George George King George was the king over there, and when King George found out that George Washington refuse to kingship and said, no, I'm a president and I will serve a term and I'll go back to month Jello.

Speaker 1:          02:28:15       Wherever he's from, was that Jefferson or whatever, either way, said or Mount Vernon. And he said, uh, uh, short came to our said if he said that he's the greatest man to airlift to be rejected power. But that's what George Washington said. I fought. I fought against. What's amazing is that it's affected their, like the goal of this works better because it does, but how did it set in over there? That's what's fascinating. Like how did it eventually they gave up power to sort of emulate the west. Well, the British, the British always had a tradition of so way before the revolutionary war, way before the American experiment. There was always, in fact the thing it started with Henry the eighth. There was always a contentious debate about how much power the king should have versus parliament, how much power the king should have versus the landed gentry verse.

Speaker 1:          02:29:11       It was always that issue, but it's kind of lyricists that the king doesn't have to show any merit like they. They didn't rise through the ranks by hacking their way through a river of enemy. They didn't. They didn't just figure out a way to bring prosperity to the land and so voted them at as king. Well actually, it's actually fascinating that this small island, the small island of Pale people, basically controlled almost the entire world on. One of the things that's given credit is that the British had this sort of religious idea almost. It was called the great chain of being and the great chain of being was you have God at the top, king is second place, then you have the aristocracy, then you have the nobility, the landed gentry, and then the surface, and if you and for you to aspire out of your place, your, your God given place for you to say, I may be an aristocrat or Nobel or Atlanta Gentry, but someday I'm going to be the king.

Speaker 1:          02:30:05       That would be considered fucking heresy. That would be the equivalent of us saying, I think white people are better than black people today. I mean, it would be to do that and use it as a quote. Yeah, exactly. You're gonna get in trouble. I know. I know. They're going to isolate him and say that with you. You have to pause in between each one, so in other words, God to speak, speaking. You're right. I worry about that stuff, but you. You would not do that. But that created an incredible order and it created a very, very good system to get shit done. When people all were in their place doing their duty. It was very easy to organize, right, but not to innovate changes like America has done. No, but the Brits were vendors because they. They did fine, but what I'm saying is they don't have the freedom that they had over here.

Speaker 1:          02:30:52       If you don't have caste system, you have the ability to rise from the bottom to the top. Now we're here. That's right. Like that. That is what is most attractive about America as potential potential. That's why we haven't had revolutions. That's why we don't have the poor confiscating the wealth of the rich because a lot of for him to believe they're going to be rich. That's a huge. That's a huge issue. Now I have a lot of friends that have come over from England, man, and they just talk about that, like how you could actually do something here and people are supportive. Yeah. They don't shoot you down. Like he said, there's a thing that happens over there where they. They don't want to see anybody succeed. They try to put you in your place and they try to downplay the possibility of your success. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:31:33       Right. To your face. It's very gauche to try to aspire. Scandinavia has the same issue. It's it's old Europe thinking, right? It's, it's, it's, it's got to be exhausting. It's why when along a France started talking about taxing the rich, 75 percent of their income, it was met with a great deal of support because it wasn't workable, but it was, you know, there's always been a real suspicion Europe of people with too much money because they become aristocracy and they become oppressive. Well, that's the echoed, but what you're hearing today about the elite, the one percenters, you know, the, the, the, the problem with wealth inequality in this country, it's called Marxism wealth inequality, man. It's called. It's called a march where we're dealing with cultural Marxism and, and you know, that's always going to be there. It's always gonna be the, it's a very easy, good guy, bad guy thing.

Speaker 1:          02:32:28       What? People don't realize that wealth is always changing, so you, you don't, you don't start wealthy. A lot of people started poor then that got wealthy than they lost their money. They got wealthy again. There is however, a concentration of have a great deal of wealth and in very few hands, you know, if you look at Google, Amazon and apple and facebook, I think the only employ about 500,000 people total and they have so much wealth. So you know, the, the, the question is what do we do about universal income? Yeah, it's crazy and I think this is all going to come to a head with Ai. I really do. I think things are going to be automated in a way that nobody has a job. Yeah, I think it's going to eliminate all driving jobs. I think that's within 20 years of our life we're going to be looking back at driving your own car.

Speaker 1:          02:33:11       The way we look back at drum brakes. I know. So now what, what do we do with human question? Very good question. With an outdated piece of machinery. Very good question. Like, um, is it manufacturing, you know, that we need robots for and maybe there's other things other than driving manufacturing and driving. Maybe there's other people will be to put your tray into a, you know thing. Burger flipping robot. Flippy starts shifted. Kally Burger. There you go. You got a burger flipping robot so it was going to get a perfect burger. You're not going to have some kid talking about pussy. Forgetting about your burger. You get to Overcook Burger. Yeah, right. There you go. So if that's the case, then it seems to me that we are. We have to figure out what to do with all this leisure time, but we have to pay people.

Speaker 1:          02:33:54       It could be real weird man. It can. I think it's one of those things. It's creeping up on us. Show to like the Internet creeped up on us. Like the Internet came out of nowhere. All of a sudden everyone had access to any answer to any question you ever wanted. You could watch videos on anything. You could learn how to do anything online. I mean there's a youtube video where you can learn basically how to crochet. You could learn how to Tan your own leather. You could learn how to build a bomb. You can fucking do anything. You can just constantly be taking in information. That's just the beginning. I think one day within the next 10, 20 years, they are going to have everything automated before it's artificial intelligence. It's just going to be in a super efficient robot that can do whatever task you program it to do.

Speaker 1:          02:34:39       It's going to be way better at it than people. It'd be pointless to have a person do that thing and then we got to decide what to do with all these people and there's got to be. It could be. A lot of us are going to be a lot of clips. Yeah, so what do we do? Is that what they're calling it? Forty seven percent of a cover of a magazine. What is it? Humility is the new smart is this book about this 47 percent of all jobs that we know of now, at least in this country are going to be obsolete in the next 20 years. Do you think we'll adapt? Yes. Human beings are. Yeah, we'll adaptable. I hope we just get more creative. I hope people start doing things more with their hands already are we already are. I mean there's, there's more access to expressing yourself.

Speaker 1:          02:35:19       The problem is it becomes like the call to the amateur where you just got a lot of bullshit out there, but I do think that we will be in a place. Well, like, like, you know, if you look at where our philosophy. So, so, uh, what was it the rise of, of European Western civilization. What the fuck was it? Oh, uh, anyway, if you look at like how the Greeks were able to export timber wine and olive oil, it gave their economy some money and they had leisure time. They didn't have to live on subsistence. They could trade for things that they needed as opposed to making them themselves. So the Greece, ancient Greece was fairly wealthy and comparison and it gave a large sector of their population, at least the Richard population time to do things like not be in the fields all day, but rather time to sit around, eat and think and talk.

Speaker 1:          02:36:15       Right? Which, sure. Which is probably where a lot of like socrates and Plato and Aristotle benefited from. Right? Sure. So you wonder like as as we get to a point where we don't have to so much, it becomes very easy to keep our bodies in homeostasis, right? Keep our bodies when they're at the right temperature and we just need a certain amount of food and shelter and, and then you've look a cheap entertainment is. I mean look at Netflix man. It's 10 bucks a month. You can watch anything you want forever. Sure. So then like what do we do man? What do we do with our time? Well we, we didn't have to think about what we're going to do from 18, 20 to 2020. We didn't have to think about it. It just sort of happened and I think that's going to happen as well, but I think we're going to have to adjust.

Speaker 1:          02:36:59       Obviously the advice we give to children as far as what's necessary, what's not necessarily tell them, I don't know what to tell your kids either. That's the thing. They're going to have to figure it out as they go along, but they got to be flexible. You know, and I also think, and this is why I've been thinking this a lot lately, I think we have to move. I think California is over fucking populated and I think it's going to get to a point in our lifetime or it's not a smart place to be. Really. Yeah. This way too many people. I mean, you know, you go to the airport all the time, you know, that drive. I had to do it the other day at 8:00 in the morning, I was like, this is hilarious. Or you'll get to a point where you don't have to fly.

Speaker 1:          02:37:35       You want to fly. You'll get to a point where that's true, but the sheer number of people, if anything goes wrong all in this one spot, it's just not wise. It doesn't feel good. Yeah. I always feel unsafe. It doesn't feel good. It feels like people aren't that valuable. They're everywhere. There were infested with the a futurist who said, you've got to learn how to learn, unlearn, and relearn. And that's the only way we're going to survive in the 21st century. I'm not really worried about pupils survive and I think we're going to be okay in that regard. The lungs, we don't get hit by anything like we don't get potent or we don't get hit by an asteroid or we don't get hit by a super volcano, which are all. All those things are actually really possible. I mean, no one wants to think that we can get attacked by Russia, but for sure we can. All sorts of weird scenarios can present themselves in this wacky life with a bunch of things falling into place and the wrong way. All of a sudden you got World War Two. It's happened. I mean, that's just the nature of humans. And if we deny the past, we don't have that was then we're different. Now. If we don't look at this rationally, we can realize how precarious we are now. That is just one thing that we can kind of control. Hopefully human beings can control their impulses to fucking hit the button.

Speaker 1:          02:38:49       Now they have. What's his name? Nassim Taleb talks about the Black Swan, so know that there's always a black swan, know that the aberration know that history is full of things you never saw coming. Hitler, Hitler, a financial crisis, the housing crisis, I mean it goes on and on and history is full of that. Most wars start as a weekend skirmish and people kind of leave for the weekend, leave all this stuff and it's going to be over. And before you know it, it, it's, it's a 30 year civil war that happened in Lebanon. That's where tellabs from, so that you've got to at least know that you're going be able to predict the future, but know that they're the unpredictable. Always be present and we'll always take what you took to be reality and flip it on it's fucking head. And I think robotics and I think ai are certainly, you know, that tidal wave. Do you worry at all about super power struggles between the United States and China and United States and Russia? Way less only because I think that there's less, there's less profit in violent warfare. Uh, it just doesn't profit anybody this way, more profit in trade and dealing with, you know, you're going to have issues like this tariff issue, but for the most part, the, so, so, so the biggest advantage is that there isn't a whole lot of advantage for a country to take over territory because that's not what makes you

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       wealthier. So if Russia came in and took over silicon valley, there's nothing that take off about doing that, I think. But that's typically what dropping a bomb somewhere. What they're saying is essentially that they're not talking about invading the United States. That's ridiculous. Yeah. They would never do that. The real question is what unless they nuked us for why would they drop a bomb where there might be some reason why they feel backed into a corner to interest in the United States? Sure. Yeah. It's not likely unless they feel like there was some way where they would benefit extremely well from having us debilitate it. It's not likely because we would attack back and it's mutually assured destruction. Right. But the fact that a person could make the decision whether or not to do that or whether or not that's logical and you're relying on a person who's essentially a murderous dictator running this fucking crazy halfass government over there.

Speaker 2:          02:41:04       I mean, what is he doing over there? I mean, you just from what you know about Russia state sponsored doping program with that guy and went straight up to Putin, everybody knew what the fuck they were doing. They were doing it on purpose because like, I mean, there's, that's a crazy country band. It's crazy and it's 2018. It's still crazy. It's A. Well, it's run by the one idea which is might makes right that the male with the biggest club is the male that, that calls all the shots. My, my. That's a big concern with me. Um, but my real big concern are natural things, pandemics, pandemic, virus or accidents, nuclear accidents and earthquakes, earthquakes. Um, the big one for me, super volcano, that is an inevitable reality that we're going to have to face one day. Whether it's 100 years from now or 10 years from now.

Speaker 2:          02:41:53       Yellowstone is going to blow, they don't know when, but it could be anytime and it could take out the entire. The whole continent. Then. Yeah, if the yellowstone blows, they say every six to 800,000 years. It's a continent killer. It just blows and everybody's fucked and it last time it happened was 600,000 years ago, so it might be 200,000 years before it happens again and who knows? We might figure out how to drill hole in there and pop it like Dr Pimple Popper. They received that instagram page. Sure half. She's drills a hole in there, like a pimple on sports. All that love out and maybe it's okay. Get outta here. Yeah, maybe that'll keep it from blowing up, but if it blows to the thousands of earthquakes every year, thousands, thousands, just constantly moving and rumbling. It's just loose crust. And underneath is Chai fantic reservoir of Melton Rock, melted rock, melted rock that shoots into the fucking Scott giant, very blood of the earth.

Speaker 2:          02:42:47       Oh, it's so big. They didn't even know it was a volcano until like, I think it was 20, maybe 20 years ago, they started doing overhead satellite photos and they're like, oh Jesus. And they, they thought it was just like a hotbed of Geo solar activity or what it would be, not geo solar, geothermal, geothermal activity, you know, they had an old faithful spray water up in the sky. They realized, oh, this is something going on underneath the surface, and then they get these satellite photos and they realized, Holy Shit, this is a, this is a crater. This thing is a crater that used to be a mountain had exploded and I want to say it. Something like, how wide is the called? I don't want to mess this up. I want to say it's like 600 kilometers wide. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's an enormous. We know is a molten lava as the coordinator of this. A bunch of shit down then it's not good. What is it? Okay, got it. Okay. No, it's 35 miles. Fifty Mile Long. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:43:50       Currently has appeared that you can read. There are so many different kinds of reality. So the reality that that if you go up into the stars, it's a different reality and if you go wait in the microscopic level, it's a totally different reality. Then you can go to the subatomic level.

Speaker 2:          02:44:04       Look at this. The region's most recent caldera forming eruption was 640,000 years ago, creating the 35 mile wide, 50 mile long yellowstone Caldera. Okay. I fucked up the distance, but still, that's pretty God damn big. So a 50 mile long, 35 mile wide volcano. That just blows up to the point where the tops not there anymore and just shoots off shit a mile into the sky. And then you get nuclear winter all over the globe in anything even remotely near. It gets cooked instantly. Is that right? Oh yeah. You fucked. So we're all dead. Oh, we're dead. It's fuck. We're dead as fuck. If yellow's don't blows, we don't have a chance that people will talk to the dikes.

Speaker 1:          02:44:44       I talk to that like Kinda like, like they'll lose a leg of this bias to a shark or something or. And they. And they ended up dying like, you know, they, they, they pass out. Um, they all said that it was a super peaceful, like they just got this overwhelming sense of peace and they were like, oh, I'm going to die now. Oh yeah. It's the brain. The brain's pumping out that dopamine and dimethyltryptamine and all these different things to try to transition you. Yeah. But like existence is a weird thing. What do you think happens? I don't know, man. Oh, well, when you go, my feeling is that talking to this quantum physicists, this bad ass dude, um, I feel like there must be this idea that existence is a question of he was talking about existence is a question of the question, what question you, you're asking or were you standing?

Speaker 1:          02:45:36       So there, there are different forms of existence, right? So there are different forms of reality. Like a, there's the subatomic reality, there's the Newtonian reality that you can measure and see we're here. If I was looking at Los Angeles from a plane that's a different perspective. It might be a different kind of reality. And I think he, he kinda like said most physicists, he was trying to explain what existence is right and how it's meaningless. And I was like, what the fuck he talking about, he's talking about mathematics. And he said, he said, well, this is a reality to us because of where we are and the space time continuum that we're occupying right now. So we are here and all that you are experiencing may not may very well not even be a reality right over in this direction. What the would mean. Say when they sit around with legal papers all day, we'll write a bunch of shit and nobody fucks up.

Speaker 1:          02:46:32       Well that's, well, that's what I mean. And I said, what's up? I go, what the fuck are you talking about? And he said he's going to win a Nobel prize. And he said, I'm okay. I guess the best way to put it, as think of you having a virtual reality goggles on and you know, people just splashing water on you as you're in the water and you're getting rocked back and forth. I guess that's the best way to describe what you, what you consider to be your reality. I was like, all right, all right. Maybe, I dunno. Maybe, maybe, but they seem to be able to prove a lot of this in like what's fascinating to me is I didn't know how to get into this, but like he was talking about how electrons can communicate with each other. I'm like got a sheet of metal and they don't.

Speaker 1:          02:47:16       They don't see each other like in terms of the actions are light years away, but they completely all work together and he was talking about how to do. There's a mathematical way of proving halls. There is a mathematical sort of algorithm that proves that they are. The answer to that is that there an invisible conductor, like something, a higher intelligence and immersion intelligence is dictating that communication intelligence or order an order. Right. But not an intelligence as well. So it tells us the wrong way to say it. And he said that to me too, because I sit intelligent and he said order and you're right. So there's an order, right? So there's a, there's an order to the chaos, right? So the way schools of fish, but you know, schools of fish and birds, a bird, guess what else behaves that way, inert matter, electrons.

Speaker 1:          02:48:04       That's one of the things that they think is going on with birds. It's one of the reasons why birds have some sort of internal compass and that they literally mentality. They react to the poles of the earth. Like they know when migrating birds, they know which way to go. Like they really do somehow or another, but they also know not to fly into each other. Like when you see them all flying together and they move in tandem, it's insane. It's insane. It's gorgeous. And you know, your brain's the same way. So the neurons, there's no reason. It makes no sense that the neurons. So each neuron is just essentially an on off switch or a, you know, it's a whatever it is. But for whatever reason, all of those neurons have self organized, organized, and they self organized. Okay. That's what's fascinating. And the way your brain has self organized, so has this sheet of metal and he kind of proved he sat around and I think he's 38 or 39 and he and he solved this, this theorem called wholesale, took them three years to make sure he was right. Don't you think that happens? There's like

Speaker 2:          02:49:08       a, like a big mass event like like mob mentality, don't you think that's part of what what is going on with mob mentality and that things happen and things can get chaotic and people just go with it. They'd go with it in mob and I think. I think the origin of that is probably survival instincts in war that in war you have to accept unbelievably barbaric reality and so you have to be able to slide into that wherever we're killing everybody with axes, let's go and then everybody else is doing it. I guess I'm in. And then he started hacking people up where you would never do it by yourself if it was just totally up to you, but you find yourself getting caught up in the way in the hive where the human hive is moving, that all these people are moving towards violence or moving towards chaos like people get wrapped up in these mob mentality moments in a very, very bad. Well

Speaker 1:          02:50:01       you can also go, you can actually, you can step back from that and actually you can explain that actually when you look at bacteria, certain bacteria and certain insect colonies. And let me explain. So somebody like Antonio Damasio who is a behavioral scientist who wrote a fucking great book but very dense, called the strange order of things and he talks about how human beings behave in a certain way, like their feelings are directly related to their biology because their feelings are essentially the, uh, the voices or the mechanism by which you know, whether or not to bring your body back into homeostasis when it's out of homeostasis. Homeodynamic actually stay right? So in other words, that mob is probably going in there with access because they perceive the feelings are they perceive a threat from that other group because that other group is going to take something from them, okay, it's going to either take their resources, their children, whatever it might be, and take over their territory.

Speaker 1:          02:51:11       So, so watch bacteria actually behave the exact same way and you can put bacteria into certain like, um, and there's a scientist who does this a lot. You can put them into certain conditions where the bacterial behave like that. They'll do some fascinating things. Not only will they fucking take over the other bacteria and go out into an all out war and kill mercilessly the other bacteria, but sometimes when they find they can't kill that bacteria, they'll actually cooperate with that bacteria. Now, how about this? Within the ranks of their own bacteria, the bacteria that are not pulling their weight, that tend to be lazier than the other bacteria that are the same. They're the same species. Those bacteria will be fucking shunned. There'll be pushed out. They will not. People like people, they're, they're, they're the weak link insects. If you look at insect colonies, they behave very much like human cultures do.

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       You got, uh, an aunt that's protecting the queen ant or a b that's protecting the Queen Bee. You have soldiers that do the fighting. You have workers that do the working and they self organize in this incredible way and nobody's really. No, it's not like it's somebody. It's not a top down thing. It's sort of a genetically programmed thing, but their behavior is very similar. Their behavior. So even with bacteria, when they can't beat this bacteria, they'll join forces with that bacteria to defeat the other bacteria that's weaker and it's fascinating. So even on the uni cellular level, you see striking similarities between humans and even bacteria. Now add to that the fact that one, only one in 10 of yourselves as a human being is actually human and the rest is bacteria back on it, that you as a human might be the Patina. You're just the Patina on a, on a background of bacteria.

Speaker 1:          02:53:03       So maybe bacteria is dictating how the fuck you behave. Well, the bacteria is also the outside skin, inside and outside skin. Flora is incredibly important. Yes. That's why I always recommend people eat probiotics is one of the things that helps you with diseases. Um, and then natural oil soaps that not non antibacterial soaps. That's very important. So, so that's right. So keeping your, your biodome yeah. In order, which is the new science might also be dictating your very behavior because it does. I think when I eat healthier and I eat a lot of probiotics, I feel more at ease. I feel more comfortable. I heard you have to be careful with probiotics because you can throw off your gut level two. And what are you eating now? I'm eating it. Food Miles. I've decided a long time ago that you can take some probiotic pills and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          02:53:52       And I definitely take someone on the road. I bring that on a total gut health because I'm, I'm on the road. I know what the fuck. I want to make sure I'm getting good food. But a mom at home, I eat a lot of fermented vegetables. I've been, I've been to the, a lot of that, I eat Kimchi like almost everyday because you're an extremist and I know, you know, but it's, it is good if you feel good, drink a lot of that shit. That Kombucha is fucking phenomenal. That gts Kombucha. I heard a uh, some oh, somebody in my family got a endometrial cancer and the doctor said the surgeon who deals with this exclusively said, do me a favor, just don't drink these for awhile. Whoa. And she goes, why? And he said, I can't prove this yet, but I see a direct link between this type of cancer and women who drink a lot of probiotic drinks like this. No Shit. Yes. CV, find anything on that. Women drink probiotic drinks cause cancer. And this is a women's drinks martinis. Blowjobs. Put that all together. Hey man, come on dude. That's too much. Just kidding. Just kidding. That would be terrifying man. If that was the case. Well I would think maybe there's a certain level, like if you, a nutty person

Speaker 2:          02:55:03       who drank like really powerful Kombucha all day. Like all you drank is Kombucha. Yeah. Like your body might be overwhelmed, extremist and anything, right? I mean you gotta have balance. The question is this to what's the metric for how many vitamins you need and then on top of that, if you have enough, what is adding more to that do? Does it help you or doesn't do? Nothing. Does do harm. Is it, is it the same for you as it is for Brendan? Is it the same for me? Like how is there a US da when everybody's body so radically different size, different know like w how come a thousand milligrams is good for this guy and it's not good for him. I think that there's a lot of people too that are probably just not getting the right fucking combinations of food too, you know, like just need to experiment, figure out what's the right combinations of things for you.

Speaker 2:          02:55:56       Like that was what the whole gracie diet was based on. The gracie diet was based on, um, you shouldn't eat certain foods and combination because the enzymes that are to breakdown fruit or not good to mix with the enzymes that break down meat, you should eat them separate from each other and like they had a bunch of whole theories about that stuff. What's your, what do you, what do you think if you, if there were certain truths about diet after all this time, like certain truths, right? Giant variations between human requirements. That's what I found the truth. I've stopped saying for a long time ago that you should do this. One thing you should definitely do is eat healthy. Right? So what's eating healthy? I don't think there's anything wrong unless you have some sort of a disease. I don't think there's anything wrong with eating a bunch of green leafy vegetables.

Speaker 2:          02:56:40       I think that Shit's very important for you. I do it. I feel better when I do it. My body feels like when I eat like a big ass salad, like a spinach salad, my body was feeling like this was like he got it in there. Yeah. You like, you got it in there. That's what I was looking for. I was looking for them. Some of that green leafy stuff. All those Fido nutrients that. That to me, that just. It feels like my body jives with that. Yep. Elk Wild game. Meat tastes better. Feels differently. Evolved. It's different. It's just different. I know it is. Everybody's been saying it forever and then want to eat it. I go, oh whew. Like it gives you that salad thing times five. Right? It's like woo. Like when I eat a nice steak, it feels good. I like a nice steak, but it's a lazy nice.

Speaker 2:          02:57:22       It's a lazy meat. If I eat a cut into nice American corn fed steak tastes delicious, but it's a lazy meat. I cut into a piece of elk or go like, oh, it just rumbles somewhere. Deepen your DNA. You eat a deer. If some of US eating deer, you're. Your body's like this motherfucker was sprinting all day. You know there's something in there that's different. You're eating an animal that has this vitality to it. A wild Vitas, Charles pollock. When you know the strength coach talks about, he goes, for me, I have to eat. My favorite made is the longhorn antelope in the north of Canada. They spent a lot of time running away from wolves, so you know the glycogen in the is always there,

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       always have a high level. There's a guy who like a meat fudge and of course you have to kill them from helicopter. You can't. You're not allowed to kill them anywhere else. So you should have a helicopter and there's only one meets two in Toronto that I go to. I'm like, all right, dude, take it easy, but it does sound delicious. Canada is antelope. Maybe it's a type of antelope. Yeah. It's not Caribou now. It's a type of antelope I think. Wow. Yeah, and they're. And they. Maybe it's terrible, but I think it's handled up. Maybe. I don't know, but either way they run away from wolves all day and the glycogen is really high.

Speaker 2:          02:58:30       We're going axis deer hunting. Maybe that's going to Hawaii. It's probably not, but acts, deer, they evolved in India running away from tigers. They're an Asian deer and their natural enemies. Tigers. You have never seen an animal. I shot a deer that was 40 yards away. It looked at me. I let the Arrow go. By the time the Arrow got to it, it was nowhere near where it was. My Arrow goes 280 feet per second. The Arrow, once it left, the string was headed towards that thing at 280 feet per second. And that deer was nowhere near it. Wow. He was six, seven, six, seven feet away, like gone. The Arrow went right into the bushes and he was over there. You ain't seen nothing like it. They like from the Matrix. Let me see an access to your big. It's about a hundred and 30 to 150 pounds for a big one.

Speaker 2:          02:59:23       Not quite as big as a white tail, like a northern White Tilak we hunted in, um, that looks, that looks a lot bigger than it really is. There's like saving and find the picture. The one that I shot, it's online on Cameron Hanes, instagram page. I try to keep them off all the dead animals, off my instagram page, send them to my hunter friends. They post them, they get so mad. Right. They definitely get mad. People get mad at me while they have a burger on their page. People are just goofy. That's my access to you that I shot. That's amazing. That's why that's in Hawaii. That was why a lot of bugs? No, no little tiny ones. Little bit, but no. What it really is, is a, a giant that's a pronghorn antelope. That's a different animal. It's not an antelope in Canada. Okay. Because I know they're in Montana and Wyoming.

Speaker 2:          03:00:12       One Shit. Okay. Oh, they're on a coin down the south. No, I don't think so. I don't think I've been. No, nope. Just Texas. Texas is not the south though. Um, so if we could organize something for Mexico urine, I'm down. I think it will use rifles. So it'd be easy for me now. Yeah, you brought me that bowl. Have yet to know. But you can't go bow hunting without. Especially if we go. Yeah, after dear. Like I said with that thing one, if you don't do it the right way, yeah, well it's just, it's just something. If you want to really do it, you got to get obsessed with it the first time you do it. It should be in a controlled environment, like one of the first way would really be a good way would be wild pigs over bait because there's a lot of places where they try to eradicate these wild pigs so they have feeders and the feeders of go off in the wild pigs are almost like conditioned to go near the feeder and then when they go near the feeder, you know exactly the distance because they're right underneath the feet are the feeders 20 yards away from you and you have a controlled shot and it's easy and it's an animal that they must kill, so there's not like a number of them that you can hunt.

Speaker 2:          03:01:22       Can't believe how many there are. There's so many. If you're in Texas, they shoot them out of helicopters. They fly around in helicopters and gun the. They still say you can't shoot your way out of the problem. Well, they're doing their best to at least do something about it. They're not going to shoot their way out of the problem to the point of extinction. They. They move so quick. There's so many of them. They're smart, tough as shit, and they have litters three or four times a year. Yeah. They just constantly running around other moms. What are the ones that I saw? There's one eating out of a garbage can in the Asia. Those got to be in. Those are not wild pigs. Those are wild boars. Well, board just means a male of female is a sound. Some of those ones that you see, they have got a razorback.

Speaker 2:          03:02:04       They're just like those. They look like they're not as big as pigs, but they're just fierce looking at. Well, it's just because the supply of food, if they had as much pigs as wild boar, right. That's. Oh yeah. That's a real wild boar, man. That's a big ass pig. That doesn't look like a real pig, honestly. That almost looks like a wart hog. Yeah, it does. So big. But here's the thing about wild pigs, man. This is something I learned from my pal, Steve Rinella. They are literally all the same animal, wild pigs and domestic pigs. They're the same animal. It's called [inaudible]. They're all part of one gigantic species. Poor capturing the size of that thing that looks like a power lifter. Yeah. The thing is it looks like it's like 400 pounds as long as snout is just tiny little bitch ass feet, tiny feet. That doesn't even seem real.

Speaker 2:          03:02:56       That seems like an animal. And like, um, like a Beatles cartoon. Like the nowhere man, you know, his proportions were all I think about John Jones and how skinny his legs are and what a fucking beast he is. And then you look at his legs was like, you got some pencil legs strong as shit too. He's strong as shit with her legs. Yeah. Chael and said he'd be cradled him. Said it was. He did. Didn't he? Cradle Ryan Bader. Yeah. He smoked Ryan Bader. He smoked. He choked out. Ryan Bader. He smokes everybody. He's. He's ridiculously strong. He's ridiculously strong too when it comes to like dead lifting and shit too. He does a lot of power lifting now so strong when he was going to happen with him. I don't know. I want to see him fight Steve Bay. I want to see them fight brock. That's what I'm saying. That's what Brendan and I were just saying. This is the card. Steep a DC. John Jones, Brock Floyd Mayweather, cm punk Hoffeld dose on Joe's Tyron Woodley. There's your paper view. Here's your papers. You. You're welcome. It's kind of crazy. You will go.

We've hired him to take sections of the podcasts that are funny and turn them into these animated clips and they're fucking amazing. He's really talented.

Thank you everybody and we'll be back tomorrow with the great and powerful John Dudley. Maybe Brian could come. We'll teach them how to shoot a bow. I'll do it later by everybody and I had a cracked filling and they took the filling out and the fucking smell that came out of my

Speaker 3:          03:06:56       mouth. I was like, Holy Shit. Because there was an infection. I had to wind up getting a root canal. It like you could hear it like pop through and then just this fucking shit breath that. My father's, my father's friend, he was sleeping. His wife said you have to go to. The dentist said, why does your breath is so out of control? So apparently he had an abscess, a sack of bacteria in the back of his mouth. Well, when they took the feeling out and they popped by accident, the sac, the nurse

Speaker 4:          03:07:33       through a fucking dentist moment, a double vomit fest. So did she puke on him or shouldn't be gone if she just puked went. I

Speaker 3:          03:08:02       like that. I never have the balls to tell someone their breaths. Testing. You work with them. You have. If you work with them, you have to tell. Friends would want them to tell me like, your breath stinks. I'm going to tell you that one cool thing about black people, they'll tell you if Jesus Christ, that's great.
