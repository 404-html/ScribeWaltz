It's called neuro one. That's how I got into it. Um, he makes a great product and he started making it after he developed a bunch of concussions from football and he came up with this mixture. It's a mixture of nutrients that a enhanced, the way his brain worked was having, uh, having some issues with that. So that's a fascinating subject.

You've got to be small. A lot of people, man, you'd be surprised. Lately, especially I talked to so many people that get tested on the job, you know, they get random drug tests for like, you know people that work for companies that don't want assholes. What's working for them and the watch be fucked up and showing up at work, cranked out on Meth, which I totally understand. But this guy in Columbus, Ohio, when I was there with Joey Diaz, he got, he's been tested 12 times and two years and so now he's a big pot too so he smokes that fake shit.

Speaker 1:          00:03:26       What's that shit called? You bite the head shops that are not what you're talking. Yeah and that cannot be good for you but like it and it kind of sucks is Dick. He would smoke it and he and I was like, how long has it lasts? About three hours and just sit there and zone out and look at a wall and like it just sounded awful. Regular regular jobs where they test, you suck the fat Dicks, right. You're right. A favors here. Go to on a.com. O n n I t use a codename rogue and save yourself 10% off any and all orders.

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       Transgression experience. Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast, powerful Uriah Faber has joined us derive favors on a fucking whirlwind tour of it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       The United States to him publicity for his book and a four in preparation for his interim title shot that he's got coming up and a little over a month right with and Burrell. Right about a month. You are a busy mother fucker cause I keep hearing you on radio shows. I keep seeing you places. I keep seeing all these interviews. How much publicity if you'd done like in the last just a couple of weeks. Uh, it's been a lot and then I'm coming off the show too. So I was filming for three months. I haven't been home in four months. Wow. God, Damn. Before that I was traveling too. So it's been nutty. How difficult is that psychologically for you? I mean, it's one thing to go away for an eight week camp, but when you're doing that show, it's like 13 weeks, right? And then you, you know, you're there afterwards doing publicity.

Speaker 3:          00:04:56       Well, I should be upbringing where structure wasn't like the thing, it wasn't like you got up at this time in the meal was at this time and this and that. It was like whenever you get it done. So I'm not like a needing to have like exact moments in the day. So it works out fine for me.

Speaker 1:          00:05:13       You just accept the fact that this is what you're doing right now. That's what I'm doing. I've been busy my whole life. Just different kind of busy. You more money. It's more money. It's more publicity. It's better, better busy. That is a, you know, it's a funny thing that people can really learn from it, isn't it? You know, the, the, the attitude that you have about what you just have to do, it can really affect the way you feel, the way your day goes, the way you interact with everybody. You can do the same thing and have a great attitude about it and it really does like it's a choice. That's one of the few choices in life that you get. You can choose to just fucking this, just got to deal with it. This is what it is. Not being a bitch about it.

Speaker 3:          00:05:51       Yeah. I mean the bottom line is everybody's got to do something during the day. Some were pissed off about it, a little things he has to do and some people love all the shit that they have to do. It doesn't matter. You know? It's all about how you're interpreting it and whether you're going to be positive or negative about the whole thing. And

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       because she is busy, I say it because I know that a lot of fighters about problems with a lot of fighters get real upset when they have to do a big publicity tours right before fights, especially important fights. I feel like it detracts from training. And we were talking here about, you know, you do in 15 minute runs on the treadmill and I just fucking jump in the shower. You just gotta sneak.

Speaker 3:          00:06:27       It's hard. Yeah. That's what it takes to, you know, it's just like, you know, just enough to make sure that I feel like crap. Right. The end of it, you know, then that's a, that's a good worthy workout. And you could do that. I mean, I could do that and probably three minutes if I need to kick it up to like 12 and then like, you know, put it on an incline or do whatever. I mean, you can get yourself tired and push herself in a short amount of time.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       That's a crazy workout, man. It's really, it's funny. Everybody thinks you have to go the the gym and workout for an hour and a half, but you know, you can do some crazy shit on an incline treadmill and you're done in three minutes. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:06:58       I mean you could, if you're doing it hard enough, there's all sorts of shit you can do to get yourself exhausted and just like mentally tapped like in a short period of time. So get us sometimes utilize that.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       Yeah. So when you're on the road, you just think like, okay, whatever I can get in. I get in. Do you ever do like hotel workouts?

Speaker 3:          00:07:16       I've done some hotel workouts, but it also helps I get folks all over. I mean really if we needed to, we could go after this and go get a role in or something like that. And I've got guys all over all over the US and all over the world now where you know, if I'm in town I'm like, Hey, let's get a workout in. Hit Mitts, get a role in sparring. I mean, everyone's always down.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       Yeah, that's so true. It's one of the coolest things about working for the UFC that I even get to do that. Like I got to train. Like Duke Roof has trained me a few times and telegraph days. Train me a few times and both guys are bad ass. I'd ask cool dudes. That's one of the things that a lot of people don't realize about martial arts is most of the people that are good at martial arts, they went through a lot of shit to get good develops character and you're dealing with a majority of people who are really fucking cool. You know, like John Hackleman cool as fuck. You know what I mean? So many of these guys, it Telegraaf take cool as fuck cylinders. Yeah. This fucking Real Greg Jackson one the nicest guys on the planet earth. Just a bunch of cool motherfuckers in this game. It's really amazing. Very few people realize it. They don't the the key to having a bunch of cool people. It's having a bunch of people their ego in check.

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       Okay. Yeah. Why, why is there a reason that especially a guy like, I mean you look at Duke Roufus and you look at Della Garate, you look at Phil nurse in Jackson, all these guys and they've been there like Phil's never broken his hand, but he's got a lump like a mountain on his hand while he's been in fights. And Rufus is a, from a fitting break, his hand, just little, uh, compounds over time just built up. I mean, these guys have been through wars. Why nothing to prove. They know they're bad ass and yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       they respect everyone and yeah, there's the worst aspect of men is men that aren't sure themselves want to convince everyone around them instead, you know, they want to be, uh, the, the, the guy walks in the room and everybody cowers and fear because they're secretly fear themselves. Exactly. Yeah. It's the weirdest thing in the world when you see a guy like that get their ass kicked. That's right. You know, it's real. Real gangsters don't flex much, I think they call it. They don't have to, they don't run fast. It's real gangsters don't have to real gangsters, whatever fucking distorted word. And the 20s, 21st century, it's become something different. You know, it's like something's good. This gangster, that's all that's all quoted from. Damn. It feels good to be a gangster.

Speaker 4:          00:09:39       Great Song. One of the best songs that they would let me come out to other songs and they will only make you come out to California kid. I tried to do it because we got to talk to Dana and have, damn, it feels good to be a gangster. You come up with some old school Geto boys. Going back to Cali. I was a dad. Bras to put one. Two. Why can't you do on going back to Cali? Is it because they have to pay? Is that that it maybe? No. Then all about marketing. I mean that's my, that's my, that is my song. When people hear that going back to Cali would be the shit. It would be awesome. That would be that. Kelly, why don't they just mash it up? Have somebody mash it up for you. I tried that too. Dana won't let us. Goddammit Dana. We're going to have to talk to him. That's ridiculous. Going back to Cali, it's the shit going back to Cali. She'll bikini small heels tall. She said she likes the ocean.

Speaker 4:          00:10:32       That's a classic. Why can't you come out to that Dana wide? What the fuck dude? When I first started the WC, I wanted California love and they would not let me come out to it. They had me come out to, I forget what I used to come out too, but they're like, ah. I was like, I want to come out to California love. And I always mix it up. Right. They wouldn't let me. They wouldn't let me in. Then I took a stand, my first Jens Pulver fight and I told him, I'm coming out to California left. Why did they have an argument over what fucking music they think they know it's cool. I'm saying allow me, is this read? This was Peter dropping, bless his heart. How dare you, Peter. Peter. He wouldn't let me come out to California and then it finally come out. Somebody probably tells him, right? I'm sure. Sure. I'm sure. But I was like, look, let me worry about what's cool for me. And you guys just fucking run the cameras and shit.

Speaker 4:          00:11:20       Well, it's sort of like become your a party, your thing. No, it's a pretty fucking dope song too. It actually, if I had to choose between which song are better. I liked that song better, but it would be cool to mix it up every once in a while. It mix it up. Yeah. Well I like Rowan bias come out till like one song, you know? I don't know why. Like Mike Brown, I like when it comes down to simple man. I don't know why he just, he always does. Like when Matt Hughes would come out to country, boy can't survive. That was part of the fun of it. You know Joe Benevidez stranglehold. Fucking love that song. That's a, that's a song that Randy came out too when he fought mark homer. Yeah. Joseph was all upset man. Oh really? He's like Randy couture. He jacked on Twitter and everything and then Mike a he owes, gives as a crackup.

Speaker 4:          00:12:08       He made some comments, he made some comment. Randy jacket his music. That's funny. So fighter can claim the music. Fortunately Randy Kennedy could do whatever the hell he wants. Well not only that, Randy's 48 so Randy, like Ted Nugent stranglehold. That was when Randy was young. You know what I mean? But he's had some other songs. I mean that's fucking Badass jam. That is. Especially when you're coming out too many black belts, letting it let people know who's boss. Randy couture. If he had adopted that strategy early on in his career, I think he could have submitted a lot of guys. Oh yeah. Once you started to like really concentrating on with Neil melanzane on submissions. I mean he's such a an expert grappler. Can we just have to go right to that from the beginning if he like, if he embraced like Brazilian Jujitsu, like right away he would be a super black belt.

Speaker 4:          00:12:57       We be ridiculous. How about, how about a guy like Mark Coleman? Malcolm, dude, I wrote about this in my book. Did you and I, it's called use your head whatever way you can and it's basically talks about how I was at a bar in Vegas with Coleman. His buddies were like, oh Coleman back in the day wouldn't headbutts were legal. Nobody can be Colman and Colman didn't really say anything, but his guys were going on and he didn't, he didn't like this claimant at all. But it's tough to fuck with that big dude on top of you head button, the shit out. This shit. That is a real weapon. Right. Well how do you feel about headbutts and elbows to the back of the head when it strikes the back of the head? Well, if somebody's got the, gotten me in a position where they can hold me down an elbow to the back of my head, fuck, go for it.

Speaker 4:          00:13:42       I mean I fucked up. Right, right, right, right. You know what I mean? What you mean? It's like you get to that point where a headbutting or an elbowing, someone in the back of the head is like, like the position you're in, you probably gonna get your ass kicked anyway. So go ahead and do it. Yeah. So it's weird. We've got a weird rule system. You know, it's, it's kind of vague, you know, and then the back of the head, it's sort of changed. I had heard it was a Mohawk, you know, it was, it was that you just got to touch the ear, you have to touch the ear. Part of it has to be like here, like some part of it has to touch the ear. So vague and it's, you know, and like situations like Eric Silva, when he got disqualified in Brazil, it was like that was bad.

Speaker 4:          00:14:21       That costs Chad a penalty. Did it really? Yeah, because that ref got yelled at for doing the Brazilians who wasn't in Mario Yamasaki Yamasaki who's an awesome, awesome, rough, but he told us in the back of somebody grabs the cage, we're deducting appoint period, you know, if it stops to take it right then he gets, he puts himself in that position doing the bag call where it was like, I mean, the guy won the fight. It was a bad call. You know, it's one of those calls that you should have the power to reverse with, um, with

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       instant replay because it was, it was clear that the guy was hurt, that, you know, prater was hurt. He was hurt. Bad wasn't clear. You know when you, when you looked at it like that, it should have been stopped from strikes the back of the head. So then you've got to play it back and then when you played it back everybody was like come on. And it was just like maybe there was one. They should, I don't know why they do it. It's weird when they have like rules, like they just say, this is just how we do it. Like, and this is how it's written. Like that's not, so you have some new technology. The average person, the average intelligent person would say, well let's look at a video so that way we can be sure this is a career defining mistake.

Speaker 3:          00:15:27       Didn't they take that away from football to, are they reinstate it? Cause when I was a kid I thought there was always an instant replay. I don't know. I don't follow football. I don't know. Since I got laid actually you wrestled all throughout high school. I wrestled all throughout high school. I played football too. I was did you really was my first love really from like third grade on up. And I think I stopped following football once I got laid and it was like Saturday and Sunday was no longer about watching football.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       It was about chicks that almost cost me my competitive taekwondo career. When I started getting pussy it was like a barely showed up.

Speaker 3:          00:16:04       Wait these girls like me cause I'm kicking him with Das. All right, hold on a second. Three evaluate.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       Yeah I showed up at class wants all Tan and my instructor's making fun of me. I'm like what the fuck you been? He knew what was up right around the same age. Pretty girlfriend followed me everywhere I went. That's awesome. That's a, that's a, that's a huge distraction for athletes.

Speaker 3:          00:16:25       It is. Well it can be Ken Bay. How about the guy that that gets all hung up on chicks cause there's like different kinds of chicks. There's chicks that'll be like waiting on you hand and foot. You don't have to worry about I'm this and that. And there's the like the chick that you have to go watch out. Cause if you turn your back, your buddies are going to be on top of her. You gotta Watch out. Those are the ones you got to watch out. What I've seen guys that like actively go after chicks like that and it's just retarded ruins. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:16:50       some dude's just love sabotage that. A lot of it is guys also that are unsure in their life and are subconsciously looking for something to distract them from all the bullshit they really should be handling, you know, about their own life.

Speaker 3:          00:17:04       So I think it has to do with their moms could be that too. Like they're like going after what they, what they know it. Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:17:12       Oh your mom's like crazy and said, you know, well that's probably the case cause my mom was like really nice and like real easy going so is mine. And what else you ask but ask her high school friends. Really. Right? Yeah. It's a, it's, that's it. That is the grand trap and picks it. Picking the wrong people to spend your time. What the specialty or like a relationship like you know, like I was reading about some guy who killed his girlfriend, you know, she broke up with him and he killed her and I was thinking, you know what a what a terrible situation for that girl. She fucked up and got like worst case scenario, one of the biggest idiots

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       in the fucking world that's so can handle a breakup. He has to go back and kill you. You know what a fucking loser like that, that it does like loser.

Speaker 3:          00:18:00       Then you got to look at her too. I mean like what made her attracted to the guy that was going to kill her? I mean it's like probably violence. I think there's a correlation there too.

Speaker 5:          00:18:07       Could be, but it also could be youth, you know? I mean I've done a lot of stupid things when I was young and they don't really define me. They just to find that I didn't know shit at the time. I mean that's the whole, the, the process of life is about, you know, learning from fuck ups. She shouldn't have to get killed because she had a weird thing for like some thug life type dude. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:18:27       I remember. I mean, I've seen girls get ruined. I was from a small town, it was like Mexicans and cowboys, you know, I moved there in the seventh grade and you'd see like a girl just like take the wrong path at next. He knows she's got like a neck tattoo and like pregnant and like the ninth grade. That was it. That's a cowboy, right? No. Where did you grow up? I was in Lincoln, the Lincoln of Lincoln. Where's Lincoln? Outskirts of Sacramento. I moved there in the seventh grade and like, you know, country cruise and there was like 7,000 people. Now there's like 40,000. Wow. And we get a lot with a lot of crap, like jumping cars out in the country. We got in trouble one time, uh, we had off campus lunch and so we'd have, you know, in the springtime season's over and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:19:20       We'd be out in the country driving around drinking beers on the roof in like doing crazy stuff. And somebody called in the school and, uh, it was like, we saw you Ryan, we'll Craig or Jim Cannon on the, on the roof of the car drinking beers and this and that. And I go back and, and I had their principal loved us and she's like, we had reports that you're drinking beers sitting on the roof. And like, we were on the roof and we were not drinking beers. And she's like, that's what I told him. You guys wouldn't be doing that free and clear. 7,000 people. What is that like? That's gotta be weird growing up in a really small, that's pretty small, right? Yeah. That's very funny. You know everybody, right? Everybody know everybody. Oh, of course too. That's weird. I don't know anybody in my neighborhood.

Speaker 3:          00:20:00       You know what though? It's good though. I mean, that's better. I think it's good. I mean, everybody knows, you know, you can't be a slime ball if you're slamming. Everybody knows you're slimeball. It's a real community. It's a community and uh, you're, you're forced to have a conscience. That's actually a interesting, I always trust chicks from, from New York or New Jersey. Really? Not Really, really? No. Only small town girls. Not only small town but you prefer, I would say I, I'm pretty good judge of character but I feel like over there like the girls are dealing with guys that are like that are a different level like the guys like on on Jersey shore a little bit, you know what I mean? So they have to kind of like adapt and become like hard and like a mild version of that, which is like a full on version of like a player out in California. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       Yeah. The the, the kind of aggression that you have to deal with on the east coast is very different. There's a lot of douchey dude's

Speaker 3:          00:20:56       yeah, like blatantly call want to take you out, girl. I've heard some like funny stories and and stuff where guys are like,

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       yeah, all right. I grew up with those idiots. You know, east coast is a different vibe, man. It's totally different. They're hardened.

Speaker 3:          00:21:11       I got my mom and my dad calling me right now. Good problem and bad problem to have. It's like, okay guys,

Speaker 1:          00:21:18       parents, uh, there, there were um, Kinda hippie is out of the deal. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:21:22       Yeah. Back in the day, you know, there, well I was, I made the 70s, 1979 and my parents were out and I live Vista, California, which is like the college town right next to Santa Barbara. And they weren't going to college. They were just chilling, you know, my dad was, you know, working odd jobs and, and they actually met at a restaurant and stuff, but they're like part of a hippie Christian commune and Oh good. So hippie Christian College. How'd they work that out? I Dunno. I was barely, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       we left. It was like for the communes always seemed like a great idea until some dude starts fucking everybody's white, you know, it's always that. It's always starts out with a great idea. We're going to form our home communities is going to be beautiful

Speaker 3:          00:22:06       movie right now. What's the movie that's out right now? I don't know which, it's hilarious though. It's about like the calming, like they stop and they're going to like get married and they like car breaks down and they'd pull into this car.

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Who the fuck is in there as a gen for Anson? Tommy, you remember? Oh my God. We're talking about Jennifer Aniston movie. Yes. We might be a couple of quarters. The legal excitedly about Jennifer Harris. Is there anybody that nailed the females genre more than Jennifer Aniston? Lock that shit down. If a girl tells me she wants to take you to a Jennifer Aniston movies, go, Oh fuck. You know. If someone says like, you're going to go to a Meryl Streep movie, that check could be anything. Do you ever meet her Joe? Meryl Streep? No. I saw her once in real life. She had a great character. She's right there. I was like as close as you are to me and Courtney Cox was there too, where you're looking through a window. No, we, when we were on it, when I was on NBC, I was on the news radio and news radio was like the redheaded stepchild of NBC.

Speaker 1:          00:23:04       They didn't get any promotion at all until after it was canceled. When it was canceled, then it became popular. It was really weird, like through DVD sales and through, um, people watching it, like on late night TV. But we would go to these things where you would have all the publicity things. Nobody wanted to talk to us, especially me. Nobody gave a fuck about me. I'm on the Sitcom. It's barely hanging on. Like at one point in time, uh, my friend Joe was one of the writers would write down on his shirt or no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Lou Lou Morton. I don't know why I called him Joe. Confusing the guys. Lou Martin used to write down his shirt. What the number was that we were ranked on TV. He came in one day and said, [inaudible] 84 we were like, fucking 84 were, you know, friends was

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       number one. We were 84. The president of NBC was on. I like, what's that Fez show that's off? Or in fact, Ron in Fez. Yeah, I think it was Ron and fast. And he was talking about after Phil died were, uh, um, Andy wanted more money. Yeah. Did you hear the whole story? I've ever brought it up cause it's a terrible story. President brought it up, I'm sure. Well, you know what I, you know, you know Andy, Andy's Andy, he's fucking crazy. But the thing that he said, yeah, yeah, I was on second with him. That guy is nuts. What happened with you and him? He Cam, is he openly gay?

Speaker 6:          00:24:27       I don't know. That's a secret. Oh No.

Speaker 3:          00:24:32       Oh, he's on some absurd stuff to me. One time I met him and the other time, the, for the first time I met him, I was at a, at a hotel downtown in La. Get you to talk like right into here. Yeah, it'd be a lot louder. Hello? We can both hear each of the grade, but on the recording people get pissed at me. It was like we were there at, uh, at a, uh, just a little bar in, in this hotel. And I'm with my manager and just kicking it. He starts, it's like coming on to me like hard. And then he's like, he's like, I'm like, like saying stuff. I thought he was joking and he says, how old are you? And I was like, 27. He's like, you're too fucking all. Like, I'm like, I'm like this and that. And he's like, I just like basically tick off.

Speaker 3:          00:25:22       Then the second time I met him, he was with a band. Does he have a band or something or you have a band at the, uh, at the hard rock and I bought and I was the elevator and his buddies like, Oh man, we're big fans. Some band there with, I forget what band it was. And they're like, come in and meet, meet the rest of the band. And he's in there and he's shit faced any, like, starts chasing me around. He's like taking a Piss, like stomach rise, like the middle of the day and he's wasted. He's like taking a piss and he like comes out Raftery he's done taking a piss and he like chased me around the room and like coming here and then I'll fuck her, I'm going to this and that and I'm like,

Speaker 6:          00:25:57       jump. I'm like, Whoa, Whoa, like pants fall down. I'm like, what's going on with this guy? I just want to be lying down in there. And it was like, but he's got kids. He's got a bunch of kids. Okay, well I don't know if that was a secret, but oh, he's crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:26:19       I've worked with that guy for five years and he's always like, you bang if you were an asshole to me.

Speaker 6:          00:26:24       No, never banged them. We've got an inappropriate for the story.

Speaker 3:          00:26:30       I talked to him the other night and I was saying like, I was like, man, I want you to come back on so bad, but I don't know you guys fuck out of here. What's wrong with you? He's such a nice, what's wrong with you dude? He's so awesome. You just see what he said. Did you just hear what you say

Speaker 6:          00:26:44       with that for five days? This guy, he doesn't want it. He never wants to believe that anything. Sam, he's like, you are an asshole to me. Do you know what you were like, you crazy. Fuck. He knocked on my door in my room and he goes open a Daria Craig. I was getting changed. I open up the door and he's like, you're in that fucking aren't you? And he had his dick out. He was like, I talked about this before, but what's fucked up about it was he didn't even have the, fucking, didn't even, didn't even get hard first to get hard. Not even having to do this is very hard. I can understand why he was gone so crazy. He's a talented motherfucker. He was. He is is a really, he

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       really funny guy. But he's crazy. He doesn't mean to be a bad guy, but he doesn't give a fuck. Which is interesting because most people do give a fuck. So there's that element of it. I mean, there's a couple of people in this world that really don't give a fuck and are entertaining, you know? And he's definitely, I really loved that level. I mean, it's just, it's just too much work, you know? I wish him the best, but it's just, I don't, you know, the, the one podcast we have the most plenty. When he started talking about how attracted he was to me, I was so attracted to you anyway. Oh, top five podcasts of all time. Yeah, because you're a sick fuck. You got a problem. The chemistry between you two is amazing. He means that it's real amazing being around a crazy person.

Speaker 1:          00:28:15       Yeah. But somebody that you know and you know that he's not going to go crazy on you. When I say crazy, I mean, like I said, he, I would still, you know, somebody came up with a Sitcom and it was going to be me and Andy Dick. I would still have to consider it. That'd be the best like bosom buddies. I wouldn't, I don't want to ever do a sit calm again though. I don't know. It's, it's, it's hard to get a guy like that a gig unfortunately because he's made a few mistakes by the way. Joe, someone up or something? I don't think so. I think he just pulled out his dick on numerous occasions that Dr com videos on Youtube. By the way, everyone download that guide. It's on there. It's from, it seems like it's from another country from it. They played the episode overseas.

Speaker 1:          00:28:54       Any episode. That's ridiculous. It's on the Internet. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Wow. Those silly bitches, they got so greedy. They figured we'll just sell this episode to like Denmark or something and not aired in America. Well in other countries there's no problem with that because they drink that shit. Well that's where the thing about fear factor is you have to, someone has to eat it in some other part of the world for us to serve it. So like when people in New Zealand and started drinking shots of horse calm, they would sell it at bars like as a, as a goof, like you have a cup of [inaudible] and then you'd get Randy like let's have a fucking hot as a bad New Zealand accent. And it was also a horse urine. You never said it was actually cow urine that I never said donkey urine because I would have to tell the truth.

Speaker 1:          00:29:38       And it wasn't dark urine, but it was donkey comp was cow and donkey Kong. Wow. Who is the test dummy for that? He's like, wow, that's really crazy. We had some people that work for him. He's under an account is working it. We had some people that work for us that uh, had to actually do it as well as the contestants. You know, we got to get people to test it to see if it was possible. So we have PA's and you know, they would only get $100 to drink, like 24 ounces a donkey come. And I had more money on them, so I gave them a few hundred bucks out of my own pocket for having to do it. But I was just like, this is the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen.

Speaker 1:          00:30:17       I had a your harsh, yeah, Andrea Summers, you know, that is a little blond. Diego, her and her boyfriend and if he'd be, how'd they do? How well do you do? She said she was 15 seconds away from winning. Oh really? Yeah. Why can't I remember? He has something to do with pot. You think Alpha brain or pot? I'll know. You know there's too many people that I did 148 episodes. Holy Shit. There's too many people 148 episodes most of the time. Most of the time it was a, it was like six, eight people. You'd have to remember every week four you'd get down to four, you know, it's like, and then the next week it would be a whole new people. And I just, my memory bank would just a race, there's a thing called Dunbar's number. Oh, there it is. There's a thing called Dunbar's number and a what Dunbar's number is.

Speaker 1:          00:31:06       Um, it's uh, looking at what does that language, I said we probably shouldn't play this dude because this is a, they're going to, people are going to get sued for that or something. I assume that was the donkey come episode. Yeah. Just see the, like the size of the bucket that's in front of them. We could show. I'll show it to you if you want to watch it. And it is on TV. I mean it is on the Internet. It's pretty intense. Those twins, it doesn't belong. There were twins and there was a Brunette twins and then two dudes that were twins. It was a twins episode. That's awesome. How many ounces of that 127 oh by the way, it's on more than one. Um, oh yeah. Cause he had one. It was on Twitter that I saw her earlier to. It's on a bunch of different formats now.

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       I knew it would come out eventually, but man, it's, Chris twins are awesome. Yeah, they were very hot. All of them are. It's just disturbing. I would love to have, when I have kids have twin boys, I would hate to have twin girls. Yeah, I know. Everywhere they go, someone thinking about fucking them. And you don't even have to be that hot. Yeah, let's not, let's not have this on think folks. If they want to find it, it's out there. Can we just do like just flashed it right when they're drinking the whites? No, no, no, no. I just don't think we should. I don't know what the legal status of all this stuff is and I don't know what my position is and don't just cause I don't know what my position is. I that might be illegal for me to do. I might get sued or something.

Speaker 1:          00:32:37       The uh, the show was because of that, which it was a good thing or the shows canceled because of that. Yeah, because the people, the people that have drink dog, I mean essentially they had a real hard time finding advertisers in the first place and then after this got on Tmz, they will like get the fuck out of here. They were pretty convinced it was going to be brought back before that. Well now with this Internet video leak, maybe it will be, maybe will become their, you know what, man, I'm happy it's done. I wouldn't do it again. I did it. I'm done. It was, it's, it's an actual job that you said last time I did, but yeah. But this time, this time I'm totally serious because I did try it. I took six years off. We'll try it again and not really anyway, back to you. And you're right. Let's talk about you man. Fucking fuck me. Um, tell me more about this. A hippie childhood cause you like grew up with like holistic medicine and apple cider vinegar, that kind of Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:33:29       Yeah. Well starting starting out was basically in the Hippie commune, you know, like, I love this. It was like, you know, free spirited Christian, like everyone, like, you know, you go to church and it's like people like reaching up to the sky and like people crying and stuff like that. But uh,

Speaker 1:          00:33:48       so you can work really well. That must have been really true.

Speaker 3:          00:33:51       Has it's called new hope, new hope church or whatever it was, didn't last. No, I mean that my family and my dad's side is first, my dad's first generation American from Holland and they're really, really strong Christians on the dad's side. And my mom's side is not so much, you know, my, it's like not, not, not anything like that. So I think it was like a mixture of the two. My Dad, you know, it was like, you know, grew up, he's the first guy, first guy from his family to be in America. And like in the 70s it was kind of like a, a wild child and stuff like that. And then like born again Christian after certain amount of time. So they spent like the early parts of my childhood were in that environment and it kind of lasted, some of the stuff lasted, you know, throughout my life. But it was, my parents got divorced when I was in kindergarten, so that was like, then I went back to one side, kind of happened at once. I had really not, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:34:42       Wow. That must have been a, an interesting childhood to go from that. How do you go from that to being a mixed martial arts fighter?

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       Uh, well the thing is about the mentality is just basically encouraging you to do whatever the heck you want. You know? And, and my parents aren't like, you know, never had any mapped out. It was always like, my dad's like super proud of anything that we ever had done. And my mom's like, you know, always just pushing you to be, uh, you know, the best at whatever you do. So this is just what I was drawn to. I always used to watch the boxing. All my favorite movies were a karate movies and, and you know, all that kind of stuff. And, and how many kids grew up with you? It was my brother and my little sister. My little sister is 13 when she was born. So it was just me and my brother. Really. She was 13 when, who was born? My brother, my sister was born when I was 13 and I swapped it. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       So what do they do now? My brother lives in Sacramento and actually

Speaker 3:          00:35:42       he's, he's, he's an interesting case. He actually went to college on a scholarship and had like a complete mental breakdown at the age of 21. Whoa. Yeah. So he's never really been the same. It's, it's kind of a, I actually, my book, I talk about it like, uh, like the whole effect that had on all of our lives and everything. But, um, he went away on a scholarship, was like the captain of the football team, captain of the wrestling team, went away to a Christian school, got recruited by this church called International Church of Christ and was like trying to live this perfect life, like not thinking about sex. He was eating less, sleeping less. He was getting like 25% of his money that he's working at Nordstrom at a cafe at Nordstrom at the time. And like giving his money away and had like a breakdown. Man, we don't really know exactly what happened, but he's a, he works with my, with my family when he can, so like that. But it's been kind of an uphill, uphill battle for us. How many years ago was this? 14 years ago or Whoa, I, senior year in high school.

Speaker 4:          00:36:45       Jesus Christ. So he was as bad motherfucker and then it blew a fuse. Like he hit the red line too hard too many times. Yeah. We don't know

Speaker 3:          00:36:53       exactly what happened. I mean, we got a call and uh, we got a call from his boss at work or at Nordstrom and then a family that he was staying with. We checked in and they said the, yeah, he's been, he's been, uh, he's lost lot of weight. He was like 165 pounds in high school, wrestling 165 pounds. He was like 130, 120 530 pounds had been like, wasn't smiling was like washing his hands, obsessive Lee and my mom and my stepdad and my, my pop and, and his wife all jumped in a car on New Year's Day in 1998 and drove to La and, and brought him home. Wow. Yeah, it's been a crazy, if you read, if you read the chapter is a chapter out of my book that talks about just life's hiccups and the uncontrollable stuff. And it was, it was pretty crazy man. Also some good stories cause after 13 years, you know, it is what it is and you just kind of deal with what life gives you. And he's a funny

Speaker 4:          00:37:54       Mofo. He's funny. He's funny. I mean he's still really intelligent risks. Unpredictable and like, you know, like we've been so easy. A different guy. Oh yeah. 100%. So like saw a fuse blew and your brother's gone and there's a new guy there now.

Speaker 3:          00:38:09       Pretty much. Yeah. And uh, you know, it's, it's, it's been a trip man. And my little sister is 13 one when I was 13 when she was born and my brother is two and a half years older than I am, so she's never really, she's never really remembered him as I grew up with him, you know what I mean? Is My older brother and everything else has been like a modified version of that. And I mean, he goes up and has some times and then has some, some bad times too, but it's definitely interesting.

Speaker 5:          00:38:38       I did. And there's nothing they can do about something like that when it's not like is it a counseling issue or is it physical aspect of the [inaudible] Stan,

Speaker 3:          00:38:48       my mom doesn't like to call it schizophrenia, but that's basically the, uh, the matrix of what what's going on is just anything that they deem is like, don't know what it is they throw in that category. And he definitely has different signs throughout time of, of having that kind of, you know, schizophrenia behaviors. So it's just unpredictability man. It's crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:39:12       You live a wild, crazy fucking life. You're a professional cage fighter. Do you ever wonder like, you know, I know that just from, obviously I've never, I never fought in MMA, but I know from seeing all the fucking championship fights that I've seen, all the high pressure situations that I've seen, like the toll that it must have on your psyche for a lot of dudes is pretty fucking incredible. Do you ever like see your brother and go, you know, this, is this possible that this could happen to me? Could I blow a fuse too?

Speaker 3:          00:39:44       Um, it is possible for anybody. You didn't think so. Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think, uh, do you worry about it? No, no, no. You can't walk around worried about life in general. He never leave the room.

Speaker 5:          00:39:58       If I had a sister that was a cuckoo for cocoa puffs, I'll go, God damn, I might be fucking crazy too. I might be in denial, you know, I might just be at least you're successful. Crazy. You know what I mean? Who knows. But well, maybe your brother should get into comedy. It sounds like every comedian. Irresponsible. Hilarious. He's definitely has his moments lost his shit because work was too fucking crazy. That sounds like a comedian man. And you said he's funny. He is that dude in the standup comedy. You're in northern California and plenty of places to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:40:28       You'd have to beat my bro. I mean there's, there's a ease. Ease, an interesting cat man. Yeah. Yeah. And we all love him. And uh, I dunno if he could, he could definitely. Uh, he could definitely have a couple moments. I'm going to pull up some videos of him on the phone, actually. Does he work? He does works periodically, but it's just when he can't, cause it's just unpredictable. There's times where he'll go like a whole year where things are straight for him, too much stimulus or happen or even sometimes a year. And he just kind of had,

Speaker 5:          00:40:58       so it's almost like he really did red line. His brain.

Speaker 3:          00:41:01       Yeah. Yeah. Wow. And we don't know what happened. I mean, we don't, as far as

Speaker 5:          00:41:07       you know, when you, when you see guys like the highest level of any, any sport, especially when it comes to like, um, wrestling or anything where it's like super ultra competitive and you hear stories of a guy like a Dan Gable, you know, you hear stories about a guy who he was a little crazy. Fucking gay was crazy. Yeah. I mean that guy paid the price for it physically too. Like today he's got hip replacements and his knees are shot and you know, yeah, for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       You have you ever read up on him? He know about his sister and all that kind of horrible, she was murdered, murdered by her neighbor, raped and murdered and stuff like that. And to heat. That was what drove him. He was a demon. That guy was possessed. You ever see those videos of him when he was younger? I mean, we'll talk about it, you know, and like she's fucking terrifying. I was terrified.

Speaker 3:          00:41:54       I wrestle. I wrestled at Uc Davis and we spent, uh, you know, we had a couple of different tournaments where an Iowa and we went to Iowa. He was retired from coaching and wasn't competing. Just old Dan Gable and we're in the room working out and he's in there in a full sweat suit with the hood up and he's drilling double legs on this dummy against the wall, just drilling. Bam, Bam. He gets on the bike and he's like just pushing himself on the, on the, on the stationary bike and just going crazy. No one else's in the room. It's just him. The guy's just like, he's on it.

Speaker 1:          00:42:30       Jesus Christ. He's never letting it go. However, I think trilon double legs. How old was he? Like 60 yeah. At least Jesus Christ's 60 year old dudes shooting doubles, drilling them with sweatsuits on

Speaker 3:          00:42:46       figure. If you get, you're in a, in a repetition. I'm the same way. If I'm, if I'm not working out for a period of time, it just doesn't feel right. You know what I mean? It feels weird. It's probably like some people were smoking cigarettes or you know, whatever else. The, the routine is become like you don't feel yourself unless you're like putting your body feel a little something. And I'll be the same way.

Speaker 1:          00:43:08       I don't feel balanced. I don't trust myself if I don't work out hard, if I, if I work out hard, I feel like my brain is able to, to react to things on an even field. Whereas if I'm stressed, like if I haven't worked out in a couple of days and I'm all, it's all built up, you got think you can over react to things because your brain is looking for some fucking something to see. I got to get rid of this pressure that's been building up.

Speaker 3:          00:43:30       Yeah. It's weird. It's weird. It's weird the way, uh, I mean it's just routine. You know, it's like, it's like a, it's like an OCD type, but I'm not by any, any means like an OCD type of person. I like, like I said, I don't, I'm not great at structure and I'm good. I'm good at sticking to a game plan, but like I could sleep in the car and this car seat, I could sleep on the floor and I don't need to like go through a routine, but some people like need to have the little things that they do right. They don't feel right in my, I think is just about a certain amount of energy that I have to exert to the day or else I can't sleep. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:44:07       That's interesting. Do you think that that is a routine thing or do you think that your body just requires that because you're mean you're your, your body is essentially a race car? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:44:15       I think my body requires, I mean I think I have a certain amount of energy that I needed to get out. If I get myself thinking about something too late in the, in the, in the night or you know, like watch sparring or watch something on my, the in a fight, I'm like amped up and ready. Right. That's a problem. Right? You have to time that shit out. Yeah. You got a time and I'm, I've been blowing it, especially with time in Vegas. It's like I just found myself not getting enough sleep, but you know, it's like not wanting to go to bed but having to get up in the morning.

Speaker 5:          00:44:45       Do you ever sleep in the hyperbaric chamber? I know you've used it several times and it's one of the things I really wanted to ask you about, cause I'm kind of fascinated by it. The results of the hyperbaric chamber are pretty spectacular.

Speaker 3:          00:44:56       Yeah. They're crazy. And I, I've, I've gone in there and slept a couple of times, but it's only, you know, you only want to do it a certain amount of time. It certain amount of, uh, length of time, you know, it's like an hour and a half for this certain time sheet kind of treatment. It's an hour for, uh, other types of treatments is dangerous. It's not dangerous. But, uh, I mean, I think it, it's, it's something that can, can he mess with you a little bit? Like when you're doing the hyperbaric chamber, nice face. He meant, I'm thinking about trying it and now, but, uh, when they do the change of, of whatever the pressures in there, it feels like you're going up and down in a plane. They can feel your ears like clicking and stuff like that and you blow them out. And when they bring the pressure back down, you can feel them popping and stuff like that also. So, I mean, you can feel something's happening. But the trippiest thing about the hyperbaric chamber was, you know, I started going in, when I broke my hands against Brown, I broke my right hand and then I dislocated my thumb on the left.

Speaker 5:          00:45:53       And so that was a crazy fight and the really impressive fight on your, on your behalf because you broke your hand in the first round, you know, and you went back and you're like, a broke my fucking head. And then you're like, oh, they're both shot. And then you're like, all right, well it's elbows and kicks. We'll just do this. But for three fucking rounds hard. Well, you broken the both of them in the first,

Speaker 3:          00:46:13       I broke the, the, the first one in the first round, so four rounds of that. And then the third round I dislocated my

Speaker 5:          00:46:20       oh wow. And a championship fight and you know, and you fighting, you know, the first guy to take your title in this crazy fight.

Speaker 3:          00:46:27       Yeah. And it was uphill. Wait too, because they didn't have 35

Speaker 5:          00:46:32       when 35 when you decided to drop down to 35 you, this is like your home now. You don't, you don't feel like, I'm like, you know, at 135 pounds, this is like the perfect amount of weight. You Cut. Perfect. You're, you're physically big as big as anybody in the division.

Speaker 3:          00:46:48       Yeah. That's, that's the thing with 40 fives. I mean, people don't understand. It's like we've got a lot of new people in the sport. They don't understand the history of it. They don't understand that. When I first started fighting, I was fighting the Indian casinos. There was no sanctioning body. I was wearing shoes. You can need people in the head.

Speaker 5:          00:47:04       I saw you fighting one of those. I saw you fighting the king of the cage and a casino Indian casinos then

Speaker 3:          00:47:11       and then you know, there was no opportunity for me to find 135 pounds. I would have, I was only 148 when I first started fighting and I was fighting one 55 and then I, I made a stand and said I'm going to fight at one 45 but that was like making a stand to do that. And I became a world champion up there and you know, after that it was like I was good enough to be right there for another title shot. I was, I was able to beat the next contenders and be competitive enough to get those out of shots and I'm never going to turn that down. I could gone to 35 is a long time ago, but I was like, I'm not missing opportunities. I want to fight Jose Aldo own a fight. Mike Brown. I want to say, you know these guys, even though they're bigger than I am, how much bigger was all done than you?

Speaker 3:          00:47:55       I talked to him. He said he tries to stay right under one 70 and I'm about one 54 wow. That's a lot of fucking way. We'd one 66 in the ring in the ring and I would want about one 53 when did before my phone's big dude. He's, he's smaller now though. He said, was it harder for him to make that cut? Oh yeah. Yeah. So you get older, it's harder and harder to dehydrate yourself, right? Yeah. What is the, what do you, what are you cutting to get to 35? Uh, I'm cutting about 21 pounds. Jesus Christ. And when you're, you know, when you're talking about 135 pound result, you know, that's, that's a large percentage. That's not like a 265 pounder. Cotton, 20 pounds. That's a lot. You know, Brock Lesnar cut 20 pounds to make to 65. That's a lot. But look at the size of that motherfucker and then look at the size of you.

Speaker 3:          00:48:45       So you're cutting your dehydrate nice shit out of yourself. Yeah, I mean well I've got it down to a science because I work out so much. My weight fluctuates like you know, five to eight pounds in a day anyways. Like depending on what I've had to eat and what my workouts are like and stuff like that. So I swing like that like drastically. Anyways. So it's just about tricking your body, you know, cause it's like how much sodium you have in your body, how many electrolytes and stuff like that. What is it going on Day Jessica and your stomach. So if you like treat yourself like a race car when it comes to the training thing and once you're down to wait, you can really like gear up just for workout, go on to empty and then either go back up from there or go back down from there.

Speaker 3:          00:49:31       And that's where the tricky part gets. And that's where I've been doing it for a long time and I have an advantage because I know my body, you know, and it's am I put on 17 pounds after weighing 13 hours? It what percentage of your body is that at 135 pounds. I'm an idiot. You got to do tell Tom even ask Brian to do it. He looked at me. I'm going to have my good Vietnamese American buddy over here. Statistics. Tami, please. Then I'm roles. It's like a massive amount of body weight. Yeah, it's, I mean the, I put too much on the ever done now over logical did the first time. Yeah. The first time I did I put too much weight on and then I didn't eat much during the, the, the hours before the fight and it's like woke up and I was like bloated and I was like, all right. I didn't eat, but luckily like an hour before I went on, I started to feel normal again. That was against music. Gawky wow. How Wa, how much of a pain in the ass is that? That whole process of rehydrating

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       yourself and trying to feel healthy again because I would imagine that when you cut 21 pounds, like when you're on the scale that day, you must feel fucking terrible. Yes, it's a correct. I've seen guys wear, they look like they're ready to die. Luder

Speaker 3:          00:50:44       well, I stopped and I drink that coconut before anything else. I'm like, you need nothing else matters. I'm going to get this. He's a lecturer. Lights in this stuff in my body now

Speaker 5:          00:50:54       you're barely hanging on. Right. It's so crazy. It's like an event in and of itself though. The weight cut. I was there when Travis Luder miss weighed against Anderson Silva. I have never seen a dude look closer to death. Travis. His lips were chapped. All the water, the moisture, it's sucked out of his lips. His whole body was completely dehydrated and he wasn't even walking towards the scale. This is after he had missed the weight and he was coming back to try to turn it to try to make it and he shuffling. He couldn't even walk you a shuffling. His face was sunken in and then he quit. He said, I can't do it. I can't do, I'm done. This is all I can lose their life. You have, you have another hour, you have another hour if you'd like to try to lose the weight. He's like, I can't do it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:33       Yeah. We had one of our guys in Brazil did that and he, he uh, Eddie hoke from Alaska and uh, he got down to like less than half a pound over. But that half nine I was in the, I was in the sauna in the workout room with him for like seven hours. He like getting in, getting out and I thought you give him a big pep talk about like, he was like moping around like shadowbox. I'm like, look dude, you got to hit a mental switch. He was three pounds over doing this. I said, you got to hit a mental switch now and start moving. You can't be sitting in the sauna. You can't be moping around it here. Like if you want to lose this weight, you got to do it. And then, so that was a push to get them to lose that last three pounds. And he got down to a little bit over a half and it was like nothing was coming off. You can no spit coming out. Oh, who's this crazy?

Speaker 5:          00:52:19       That is so scary, man. It's so scary that you're basically bringing yourself on the door of death and then you got to have a cage fight 24 hour, 27 hours later.

Speaker 3:          00:52:31       I feel like, I feel like it's not, it's not that bad for me. I I could 21 pounds from where I'm like heavy, like Super Janky. But when I'm in your leanest prime winter in shape, when I'm, when I'm, when I'm trying to watch my weight and keep my weight within within like a striking range, I'm about one 5,152 and 53 maybe and then back down to like 48 to 53 you know, so that's what, so at 48 the lowest for 13 off. Yeah, it's 13 off. And then from there there's the cut and I, and I'm like real smart about sodium intake and, and things like that. I'll have like I won't drink water like a lot of guys do this whole water flush thing, I don't do the waterflood I do because a pound of water was the same amount of as a pound of Gatorade or or coconut water or a Kombucha or something like that and you're getting stuff out of that. So if I'm going to drink a pound of fluid, I'm going to have something positive come out of that. Some energy in something that that gives my body, you know, something to work with.

Speaker 5:          00:53:32       That's very interesting. So you don't drink a lot of water, you drank water and all this other stuff as well?

Speaker 3:          00:53:37       I drink, yeah. I drink fluids with purpose and that helps me get the most out of, have a little bit of energy. I feel good when I'm, when I'm cutting weight all the way until like the day of the, the actual way in. And then it's like, okay, the last four pounds really sucks, but it's like it comes off and then I feel fine right afterwards as soon as they get something back into me. But it's really knowing how to manipulate your body.

Speaker 5:          00:54:01       Do you use the same principles? I mean there's, there's something going on with this where guys drink a massive amount of water up until, you know, is it, is it the same principle that you use just with Kombucha and coconut water and all that stuff? You drink massive amount of fluid.

Speaker 3:          00:54:15       I wouldn't say that. So, so it's like this, you can get dehydrated. For me, they're having too much sodium or not enough sodium, right? So if you have not enough sodium, you get dehydrated. As much fluid as you have, your body's not going to retain any yet. It was like the osmosis where, you know, water will filtrate and go to your body wherever the sodium electrolytes and wherever it needs to fill in. You don't have any of that. There's nothing drawn. The water in your body will just go straight through you. So I kind of go with that. Like, I'll cut down on sodium quite a bit, but I'll have like sugars. I'll have like a, like some sort of chill mixes that I make myself with like black licorice, uh, ginger snaps. I'll have, uh, like a bunch of like whole nuts and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          00:54:54       CAROB chips. So there's like sugar in there, but there's also like some protein and some fiber. And then I'll have coconut water and coconut meat from the inside of the baby coconuts. And then I'll have like a little piece of fish or um, like smoked salmon, something to get a little bit of sodium in. Yeah. And then, and then, uh, you know, whatever I drink fluid wise, it's like a Kombucha is good for your digestive tract. It's good. Like helps you break food down and keeps things. Probiotic, probiotic. It same with yogurt. So I'll have like that kind of stuff. And then egg whites in egg whites, make sure your body doesn't break down muscle and you're getting all the rest of stuff to run everything through you. And it's kind of like your body's not taking up any of the fluids that you're putting in. It's just taking what it needs and then you're going to go lose it again. And then you can either go up or down from there.

Speaker 5:          00:55:44       Is that your standard diet? The, when you get down to like a certain point way cutting the hell this is, this is all you eat.

Speaker 3:          00:55:50       Yeah, pretty much. And I'll mix it up. You know, it, my diet isn't very, very, very a ton from when I am in him not cutting weight. I just like eat more or less. And then like consider the sodium thing quite a bit, which is like a trip.

Speaker 5:          00:56:05       That's gotta be a weird fucking dance isn't it?

Speaker 3:          00:56:08       Yeah it is. But when you know your body, I mean I've done this since, uh, I mean I remember cutting weight in the eighth grade, didn't know what the heck I was doing and then I didn't cut weight my freshman or sophomore year and then junior and senior year and then all through college.

Speaker 5:          00:56:25       Is there a way to cut it out of, of the sport or is it just a part of sport forever?

Speaker 3:          00:56:29       You could have, you could have like a two hour weigh in, but, but dudes would still try. Right. What had happened, and this is what happened in college with me, is you start out doing a real strict diet and cutting weight and then you've got a season where it's like, uh, six months out of the year where you're cutting this weight. And what happens is you just start losing muscle and you downsize your, your body anyways. So this is better because athletes are doing it two to three, maybe four times a year. And you can just train just specifically for that fight and then you kit to maintain your muscle, your muscle mass and things like that. Cause you can bring it right back. But what happens in a long season, or like if people need to downsize and compete within a two hour period, those is downsize their muscle. So it'd be like the same thing. So dues was still lose weight anywhere, did lose weight, but to be over a more dramatic time. Um, and I mean there's certainly that will,

Speaker 5:          00:57:26       yeah, they are. They're trying to get people to weigh in right before they compete. The one deals I think does that right? Yeah. They weigh in right before that's not the head trauma. The thing about striking that makes it dangerous is a head trauma was on fluid in the brain. That's a, none of the deaths that have occurred in boxing have occurred in the heavyweight division. They've all a occurred in light of weight divisions. Really? Yeah. And the idea is that those guys were all cutting weight and when they, uh, the guys that are getting hurt, like Gerald Mcclellan, well, he's a famous wake cutter, used to cut a lot of weight, you know, that, that, that plays a part that's not the only factor, but it, uh, that it plays a part.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       I actually went to a speech to the doctor in Sacramento gave about that and he, he had me as a guest to listen to everything and, and it makes sense. Yeah. I mean your body is held in place by, but your brain is held in place by a bunch of fluid and if you're losing a big percentage of your fluid from your body, some of it's probably coming from your head. Do you replenish with ivs? Uh, I do. Yeah, you have to a bag in half. That's what's happened the first time I made 35 uh, I, I did too much of the ivy had like almost two bags. It is too much now. I do like a bag and like a quarter.

Speaker 5:          00:58:38       What a crazy process man. It's pharmacy. It's a totally different thing. Concentrate on while you're concentrating on a professional cage. Fight against a trained killer

Speaker 3:          00:58:47       dude. It's nuts. But you know what, it's, it's to stay competitive. And it's funny cause when I got into fighting, they, I told the guys I was training with, I said I want to go, I want to fight one 30 fives and they're like, we don't have one 35 and I was like, well what about one 45 second? I wouldn't have one 45 but it, it really turned out to be something good for me. You know, I, because I was competing when I was healthy, I just felt like fighting. I couldn't imagine going through a season like wrestling and wanting to get in a fight when I was 133 pounds, you know? He did not feel like fighting anybody. You feel like, like, all right, go ahead and take my girlfriend and my money. I'm going to sit over here and think about food.

Speaker 5:          00:59:31       It's a horrible thing. And during adolescence to that kids go through and you know, wrestling is the fucking, they're starving themselves while they're growing.

Speaker 3:          00:59:39       See, I didn't start wrestling until the eighth grade and then after that I didn't even know that I was supposed to be cutting weight as a freshman and sophomore because our team socked in and it was like I was the best guy on the team anyways. And so it was like, just go wherever I wanted. You know? It's pretty funny.

Speaker 5:          00:59:56       When did you decide that you were going to make a transition to MMA?

Speaker 3:          01:00:00       I decided they actually did, they did an interview with me after my senior year in college and they asked me, um, what was next for me. And I've never been a guy that has planned much, you know, I've just kind of like just gone with the flow, whatever I felt like doing, doing. But I remember saying, I think I'm going to try out mixed martial arts. And there's actually an article in the newspaper, like the College newspaper. I said, I think I'm gonna try this, this mixed martial arts thing out, you know, and, uh, it, it was illegal in California. And I started coaching at Uc Davis. I was getting paid like $7,000 a year as a full time job busing tables at a, at all

Speaker 5:          01:00:42       $10,000 a year.

Speaker 3:          01:00:44       I thought it was a lot of money. I mean, I knew it wasn't a lot of money, but it was more money than I was used to, you know, and I didn't feel like I was working. And I started a little business called top line coaching and I went and got some uh, uh, like a little elementary school group of kids that I started training. And then I had a, uh, some camps that I, that I put on the college that I, that my coach let me put them under my business name. And so I actually was working like 16, 17 hour days in addition to training. I was doing my full time Gig at Uc Davis and I was coaching kids afterwards and then I would go home and I'd bus tables at this little bar called ink. And My, my rent was like 220 bucks a month living there. Wow. And uh, yeah, it was crazy, man. And I started fighting. At that time I had my emergency teaching credential. I was going to start teaching some, you know, be a substitute teacher a little bit, but I took a fight, made 450 bucks or 500 bucks, 200 to show 200 to win a 100 bucks for selling tickets. And I was like, make that in like a week, you know? That was like my monthly salary was, was that, so I, that's, that's when I hit the switch. Wow. Yeah. That's crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:01:57       Holy Shit. And what year was this? 2003 you were how old? I was 23 wow. So you had like, it was, it was like, it was more of a financial thing that, that sent to you in,

Speaker 3:          01:02:10       well, I could've got a job. I just graduated from a major university and I could have actually got a job. It wasn't a financial thing. It was like not worrying about financial thing, you know? And it was like, dude, this was awesome. I was like, my first fight, minute and a half, I made, you know, almost 500 bucks. I didn't tell my mom about it. I didn't tell her about it. She found out, like I said, I told her like two weeks later, I said I had the little tape and I go, mom, I got something to show you. And I, and I sat her down, I put the tape in and she's like, what the heck? And she's, I'm in 23 at this point. I've lived out of the House since I was 18, you know, around, and she's like, please tell me you're not going to do this again.

Speaker 3:          01:02:50       And I'm like, you know, kind of smirking and, and she's like, you're, I will pay you not to do this, that. And she's, and I said, I said, it's going to be 500 bucks per minute and a half. That's what you're going to need to pay me. No. Did you have a lot of striking training in that? But at that point, was it all just rustling? No, but I thought I was bad ass, which is important. You got to see if you look up my, uh, my second fight, my first fight, I tried to hold it together. I like came out southpaw and I started firing straight street punches and the guy came to take me down and my, and it ended so fast. I was like amped up for like an hour afterwards. Like, ah, I wish it would've lasted longer. I wish he had done this.

Speaker 3:          01:03:32       I wish I would've done that. And, uh, so I said, next fight, I'm just going to strike. And I had this guy, uh, who was like, had been training quite a bit and knew what he was doing but was just not a tough guy. Like, I mean if you look at him and you look at me, you know, not to judge books by the cover, you knew I was going to win, you know. And so I just kept it standing for seven minutes. I beat the crap out of this guy. It's, it's horrible. And it's like cat and mouse like punching him. I'm trying to help him up like re rear end back like this and running at him with a like a like a fist and throwing haymakers it was crazy. And you were going down training. How much striking training had you had by them?

Speaker 3:          01:04:15       Like about my first fight, about a month, a month, but not real training. Just like no one. I was going to throw punches and like working on myself. And then, uh, you just worked with yourself? I mean, just like I was, I mean, I've been in fights before. I knew I could hit hard. I have like a heavy right hand and I've been a huge boxing fan my whole life, so I knew what it looked like. There was coordinated guy, you know, so, uh, I just thought no one would be able to beat me up. I'm like, there's no way really anybody's going to beat me up. Wow. That's pretty fucking confident. What was it like when you had your first loss? Uh, it didn't hurt, but it was a little disorienting. I went in and uh, it was against Tyson Griffin. We were fighting in a parking lot of a casino up in northern California and it was like, it was like hot out.

Speaker 3:          01:05:06       And um, I went in there in the first round, I do like a superman punch and then I need him in the face and I hit an inside trip and I brought my head to the outside and the Kingdom of the gladiator challenge. Guys were having trouble with the Cajun. They were lazy and so they took the black covering, but they didn't put the padding over the steel on the bottom of the cage. So I did a head dive as I was taking, uh, Tyson Griffin down and just slammed into the cage. Oh my God. And my head just started gushing blood and seven staples after the fight, it was eight seconds into the fight. So eight seconds in the fight, I'm just blood's gushing down my face and I've got them in a guillotine and I'm shaking my head like this and I'm telling her, Herb's a ref and I'm like, herb, my, I'm busted open or I'm bleeding or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:05:58       So he breaks us in a, in a guillotine position. And I was odd to shape. I mean, I was all discombobulated and Ted Williams comes in and I had sold like 300 tickets. This is house making money at this time was selling tickets. I'd sold like 300 tickets to get here is eight seconds into the fight and the doctor comes in who end up being a vet and Ted Williams comes in and he, the doctor's looking at me and Ted goes, is he okay? And uh, now he said, are you okay? The doctor said, I said, I'm not sure. You tell me, you know, and uh, and then Ted said, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine. And they just started the fight again and then I don't remember anything. I was just going crazy. It was like a wild, it was like a herb says one of the best fights that guys have never seen.

Speaker 3:          01:06:44       It was just like a knockdown drag out back and forth. And I, my Jujitsu instructor at the time, Casio didn't, didn't make it to the fight. I just have my striking coach at that time, day Merino wool and I didn't know what was going on. It was like a close fight the first and the second rounds, uh, you know, it was probably one on one for rounds and he, my, my coach is like, you got to knock them out. I don't have any knockout, like any street series knockouts at this point. So I go in at the beginning of the third round and just do like a jumping right hand and he throws like a straight right, right on the button and drops me and I didn't go out. But, uh, I was like, like getting pounded on in. The ref called it. You were probably so fucked up from the first shot.

Speaker 3:          01:07:28       You were able to fight three rounds. That's what ties to the bar. A metal I Tyson, I had had like a little beef after that for a while. It was just kind of like, because he felt like I was making excuses. I'm like, I didn't make it cause I was telling the story like yeah, I got seven staples in my head after the fight and this and that. I was like fighting like a wild animal. And he's like, his guys from his hometown were saying I was making excuses. I'm like, I understand the lost the fight. I'm just telling what really happened. Not Saying, oh we like had a fever or anything. I really hit my head and he was huge. You know, he's got about 40 pounds on me walking US Christ. Yeah. So wild west man of MMA though. Those were the days, man. Those king in the cage events were pretty fucking nuts, ma'am. Yeah. Indian casino parking lot. They would do it if it rained. Did you ever see wet and wild?

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       Yes. What the fuck is that

Speaker 3:          01:08:18       dude? That was them just not wanting to give money back to people and just let it, yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:08:22       Yeah. They had came in a casino in the pouring rain, I mean, and it was a plastic cover, so you'd go up, guys would go out and try to throw kicks and just fly through the air and in their heads. That is so crazy. A lot of people didn't fight. They said, fuck this. I'm going.

Speaker 3:          01:08:39       That would have been smart. I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have gone home, but I would have wished I would have. You know, you get some stupid stupid shit would like your, when you're hungry, like probably for anything, you know, just hungry for, for, for success. They're like willing to do anything before it even. You see that in these levels. It's just nuts.

Speaker 5:          01:08:59       Yeah. That shit. That's fucked up. I mean, that's why one of the reasons why you need regulatory bodies, he needs someone to come and go, no asshole. You're not going to have a fucking outdoor fight in the rain. What are you going to do of lightening comes in? Is that part of the battle? Yeah, no, no. At least if they're in the rain, they should be able to fight in mud or something. It's just, it's too, too animalistic. You know what, we talked about our elbows to the back of the head. Um, do you like the rules the way they are now? Like do you think that, uh, that, that everything's good or do you think that we should have like needs to a downed opponent or is anything you would like to add?

Speaker 3:          01:09:33       I think you should be able to do a nice sit down opponent and even kick a guy while he's down because I mean, this is a fight. The thing that's so intriguing about our sport is that this is what would really happen if you mess with someone and they know what they're doing. This is what you're going to have to deal with. And it is still that. But um, you know, it's just, it's like one of those things where you gotta you gotta look out for people safety, but you don't want people abusing the rules. Like putting their knee down all of a sudden and like putting their hand down. It's like if you're in a bad position, you should be able to have to react.

Speaker 5:          01:10:08       The only other argument I've heard that's a against stomps and soccer ticks and the ground is the cage. They're like, if you're going to have stops and soccer kicks on the ground, you should have a ropes so you could slide in the ropes to avoid it. You shouldn't have a spot where they can shove your head up against it and soccer kick you in the head because it's not natural. You should be, you should be able to move around. He shouldn't be able to use the cage as an actual weapon, which there's an argument in that that at least in pride they could, they could see the kick common that they can move, they can move. Like if you're running into a wall, you can't move. You just going to get soccer kicked in the head. You know, you could say, well, you should never let yourself get into that position, but it seems almost like you're using the cage in a way that it probably isn't that sad.

Speaker 3:          01:10:48       Yeah, I could see that. And I mean, but in, in reality, and I always go back to, and that's why I was good on Dominic because this is really like the gladiator days where it's like a simulated fight to the Dominick Cruz

Speaker 5:          01:11:02       for folks who don't know is your, uh, last, uh, last time you guys fought, it was a very close to decision. A lot of people thought you could have won. A lot of people thought he could have. Well, we were very, very close fight and you guys were set to fight in the rematch. But uh, Dominic recently blew out his knee, so now you're going to be fighting Hanan Barao but yeah, you've Cree criticized Dominic style. It's like point fighting, right?

Speaker 3:          01:11:23       I mean his, you can't really criticize him too much other than the fact that it's not, I don't, I feel like he could have potential to finish some guys, but he doesn't go for that. And this is really a simulated fight. I mean, this is a fight to the death. It's in Diaz says the same thing. It's like if we were in a fight to the death, you know, who'd win, right. You know, and, and at, at that, on that level, like I'd like to see guys try to finish all the time. Right. You know, like play by the rules and this and that, you know, like, like tag somebody and like it, it looks like you're hurting him. And I feel like Dominic has potential to do some damage. He just doesn't know how or doesn't try, you know, to finish. It's a mentality thing. Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:12:06       Now this, this style of fighting where you just go by and get points, but, but still, when I mean it, it can be effective for guys. And what's it all for? I mean, how do you, how do you make a distinction? Like when do you decide whether it's about, it's all about being as entertaining as possible or it's all about winning. Like it seems to me that there's like,

Speaker 3:          01:12:29       I just don't feel like that's winning. Ah,

Speaker 5:          01:12:33       so to you, it's not honorable to try to like, just point your way through it. You're trying to,

Speaker 3:          01:12:37       Dominic for example, is not, it's not dishonorable. I mean he's, he's trying, he's trying to do damage and maybe just doesn't have it in him. I don't know. But the,

Speaker 5:          01:12:47       he makes fun of the size of his hands. You know, it makes fun of it. We did an interview and he's say, I got a bitch hands, you know, cause he broke his hand. Yeah. That's, that's something, there's nothing you can do about that. Right. I mean

Speaker 3:          01:12:58       there's nothing you can do about that. But I mean, I'm not taking anything away, but I would say, you know, the, the purpose of this sport is like to finish and do damage. And you can't really knock a guy who's really great at what he does, you know? And, and he is trying, I mean, I guess if you get a guy that that crumbles, he'd probably finish him, you know? But, uh, I like to go in with a mentality of, of let's do war that's brow is going to try to finish me. I'm going to try to finish brow, you know, and it's going to be till the, till the bitter end, you know, it's not going to be like pitter pattering and stuff like that. That's going to be a sick fight. That's going to be a second. Yeah, I was looking at it and it's crazy. It's like he has, I think he has more fights in idea. He's got 13 k, O, t. K. O. S. He's got six submissions and he's got like nine decisions and I've got 14 submissions, a seven t, k, O, k Ios, and like four decisions. There's preferred this fight.

Speaker 5:          01:14:01       It doesn't mean if you had a choice between this fight in the fight with Dominick Cruz,

Speaker 3:          01:14:04       I want this. I want the fight that fans want to see. And I think people afterwards, I'm going to prefer this fight, but we'll prefer the Dominick Cruz fight. So I want to give people what they want to see in, you know, Dominic and I have a history that we need to solve and stuff like that. I mean, I was really looking forward to fighting him. But as far as an exciting fight goes, this is going to be a crazy fight.

Speaker 5:          01:14:26       It's a funny thing, this Dominic thing, uh, because, uh, I've never seen you be upset by an opponent. I've never seen you trash talk and appalling. And you know, you're usually pretty easy going guy. And when I've talked to you about your opponent, you're pretty analytical about their skillset, but, but there's something about Dominick Cruz, it gets under your skin. But is it the, I don't know if you know the history of us, but I know you won the first fight. We got caught him to gates.

Speaker 3:          01:14:50       Well, when I, when I, when I first time I met him was after he was just being an immature little punk. And this, I mean, I, I'm like, you know, open to be cool with whoever. I never met the guy, I don't know him from Adam. And he like kind of chose me as an enemy and in the real world that guys in my town, we're going to do, we're going to do some sort of battle, you know, or he's not going to do that. You know? And we did and it still didn't go away. You know, it's like the guy's got a chip on it so I really believe he's jealous of me for some shape or form. And like I've sat there and talked to them before and like he's like complain about stuff and he's gotten a lot better cause I think his situation has gotten a lot better. He's getting more notoriety and more money and things like that, but I think he's jealous, you know? And it, it gets on my nerves. Like, dude, you got plenty of great stuff going on in your life and he's got to choose me as the person he's going to be negative about.

Speaker 5:          01:15:45       Is it that or is it just that that's how he gets himself fired up to compete against someone? I don't care. You don't care. I mean, I don't care what his, what his money it is to be a dickhead to me. You don't be a dickhead to me, period. How was he being a dickhead? Like what did he do?

Speaker 3:          01:16:00       Well, okay, so, so the first time we fought we signed those posters, you know that story, where were you sign? Everybody takes home, you know, your certain amount of posters that you put up in your gym and stuff like that. They give some to charity important people. And he was pissed. His face was on the poster. There's four title fights that night and say put all the champions on there. And so he starts signing his name over my face of the posters that everybody takes home. And so like that started and then after the fight I beat him. And then I've got friends in San Diego. I was, you know, helping promote a fight in San Diego. And all I hear is Dominic's running his mouth and like talking crap about me. I even thought about the guy, you know, and he's got my poster up in his jam and he's, you know, defacing it.

Speaker 3:          01:16:49       And just like talk in chat and I'm like, what is this guy's problem? Like obsessing like he's got a fucking hard on for me or something. You know, like, dude, I could give two shits about this guy, but you fought him again. And then we fought them in and then I fought him again and uh, I felt like I did more damage in that fight. And you know, that the events prior to that fight kind of let things set things to rest with us because we had, as it were, forced to spend time together and this whole camp Pendleton thing when we did this crucible and like, they're like tugging at her heartstrings about the military and they put us through this crazy workout and like, you know, that's when I actually got to get to know him a little bit better and realize like, all right, the guy, the guy's coming from a place where he feels like he's been misrepresented, he's feels like he's underpaid, he's mismanaged, he's this and that.

Speaker 3:          01:17:40       And we actually had some good talks and kind of put the the beef aside, but I feel like there's still a little jealousy there. You know what I mean? Had some good talks and he's still like to fuck him up. Oh yeah. And vice versa, you know? That's really interesting. So that must be a very strange thing to be spending so much time with a dude. You're about to go to war war. It was weird in the, you know what happened in like slipped through the cracks. It was like new PR people and the Marines setting up this thing that was going to be a a like a partnership with the UFC and this and that and no one really understood the fact that he and I were fighting in a month and a half and they're going to have us working as a team together, like going through this crazy crucible.

Speaker 3:          01:18:26       We did a third of the crucible, which is like the like the initiation ceremony where they put these guys through hell for 50 hours and no sleep and all this stuff. Phil Davis, Rich Franklin, Dominic and myself had to go. They're like, okay, we're going to shoot these guns with La and meeting these marines, whatever. The next thing you know, they're like, we're going to do this obstacle course, which is a small little obstacle course. Go to meet the drill sergeants and they're like, you know, they were not cracking a smile and this and that. They have to start doing this, this uh, this like short but intense, uh, whatever it's called, obstacle course. Then they throw backpacks on us and we start our day marching, whether yelling at us and all this stuff. Then it goes to the next thing, next thing, next thing you know, it's like 10 o'clock at night.

Speaker 3:          01:19:11       We'd been there for like nine hours just getting like punk by these, by these marines and like crawling through dirt, carrying fucking ammunition stuff. Like, like Dominic heard is he ran and got, got hurt his knee tripping over Bob Wire and he has his Christ. We're all jacked up. He had like his shoes didn't fit, so we had like huge blisters on his feet and I ended up hurting myself a little bit. I had a broken hand at the time. I didn't know I was to be doing this stuff. I had a broken hand. It was like a week and a half old, just a little fracture. And I did, I climbed the top of the rope. I did the pullups, they did all this stuff because I didn't want to tell my opponent that I had a broken hand. Oh my God. So it was like, man, it was crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:19:55       That's ridiculous. What is terrible idea? Who the fuck put that together? It was slipped through the cracks. All new workers that UFC and like Redo it. By the time I got in the middle of it and everybody got in the middle of it, it was like the marines, they're like appreciate about America. And it was like, dude, you know. I was like, just like Phil was laughing and, and the, and the guys like Phil, you will stop laughing right now. You will the blower blood in like so he's trying not to laugh. And the other guy says, uh, the other Joe Sergeant says, Phil, when he says, stop laughing, he means hide your teeth. And then I start fucking laughing. I'm like busting up laughing and, and then, and then so they're like, Zap, funny Mr Favor, you think there's funny something funny about Americans dying in war.

Speaker 3:          01:20:39       And then I'm like, all right, this is like, okay, this is right at the beginning. Wow, we're getting like this, this whole thing that's a Moronica sentence. We had to do a, yeah, we had, we had to do something, uh, where we like we're doing these problem solving things. We had to like communicate, like one guy was the leader and we had to like get these like big buckets past the ropes and follow these rules and like problem solve and like communicate as a team. So I, by the end of the thing, it was like we were cool and then, you know, we were like, he's asking me advice about stuff and, and really, yeah, vice versa. And then we'll get her advice and give him, give him some shitty advice. He would just, I was, he was complaining about his mismanagement and all this kind of stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:21:21       And I was like, dude, just say I went through the same stuff. He's like, I've been fighting just as long as you, I was there. I met you when you fought Charlie Valencia for the title. You remember meeting. I didn't remember meeting him or whatever. And it was like, he's like, I, I this and I that and just feeling sorry for himself. I'm like, dude, stop feeling sorry for yourself. Do this. And he's like, well, am I on the right track? And I'm like, yeah, you're on the right track. Do you just chill? And uh, and that was it. And then we went our separate ways and is back to being an enemies.

Speaker 4:          01:21:50       What a strange thing that must've been preparing for a title fight with a guy going through this. This is like a bonding experience that you didn't want to have and some guy yelling at you. Do you think it's funny when Americans are dying at war? It. Fuck it. Every time. Every time you go to the funny, right now this is funny. This is funny. We're not needing, not preparing soldiers stupid, which trying to give you the authentic experience. It must have been. It wasn't tense row. So it was intense. Do they crack a smile afterwards over?

Speaker 3:          01:22:22       Yeah, we all went out and had a, had a good dinner and stuff like that. And uh, that was, that was the last Dominic I hung out and good terms.

Speaker 4:          01:22:31       Wow. Been enemies ever since. So this is before the rematch. This is before the rematch. How many times did you drop him in that fight?

Speaker 3:          01:22:40       I times where I hit him on the Chin and he dropped three times.

Speaker 4:          01:22:45       Three times. That should be, you know, it's, it's, she should be fat,

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       right. Anything I hadn't, I had long hair. Next time I fight him, I'm not going to have my hair loose. Cause every time, you know, in sparring I, there's all times where you guys crazy, you slip and you move and stuff like that. But your hair goes for shakes. Judges. I mean these judges, I don't even want to get started on that. Don't even get started

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       cause I'll go crazy to go get, get started. Does it drive you nuts? Oh my God. Disrespect. Right. It's total disrespect. I'm not going to start on it because I see all these judges all the time and I don't want them angry bias against me. Yeah, but like the comprehensive script. Some of these judges that, you know, I've never wrestled, never did judo and Jujitsu, never done karate, never done boxing. And it's like, why is my life in your hands and why? Because the athletic commission doesn't want to change. What's what? They feel like they already set in place. I have to admit they fucked up. They would have to admit to these people are out. Yeah, they won't do it. I mean it's, it's mind boggling. It's just a 50 50 chance they should, they should have to review fights and have to explain.

Speaker 4:          01:23:49       I mean, it's a big goddamn deal. You, you train for a, you know, eight weeks plus for a fight after every fight. They should not have to only judge, but explain what was going on. They explain why you thought that this was better than that. I've been so tempted to grab one of these judges that I know doesn't know anything and ask them on camera. Ask them a full interview of like, what is an Omoplata? What makes it, what makes it work? What makes it not work? What is this? Is this a dangerous position? When does it become dangerous? When is it not? And you just like see where they're at. Dude, I see credit, I don't want to say any names, but one of the guys who's that judges told me that a woman judge asked him what is, what is this guy doing?

Speaker 4:          01:24:36       Like I was attempting and Kamora she's like, what is he doing? She had to ask what a guy's doing and on top of that she doesn't know what it felt like. Whether it's going to hurt the guy or whether it's just a or, well, yeah, like you know when someone has a, they got an Americana and it's all up here and you're like, you think he's going to be okay. He's going to just kind of twisting his arm and then the guy who holds it to the body and you've got to know that that's better. Then once you get it to the body that's, that's like a near submission. There's so many guys out there that could really use those jobs that really know what Charlie Valencia, for example, my good buddy who's an accomplished fighter, been fighting for years, knows the sport inside and out.

Speaker 4:          01:25:12       If he was a veteran, yeah. If it was a lucrative job, yeah, it should be to what it, what a great judge he would be. You know? Absolutely. Everything knows. It feels like to get punched, know whether you get hit on the top of the header. If you get hit on the chin, you know Ricardo, Amanda's doing that now. That's great. That's what they do is absolutely fighters. I agree with you 100% it's just there's people that they might be able to never have boxed and judge boxing, you know, but you have to study boxing and you have to talk to experts and stuff. But I don't think it's possible for you to know what the fuck is happening in a cage fight unless you have some martial arts experience. I know a lot of, a lot of grappling, mixed martial arts, mixed martial arts, a lot of grappling that, what does that say? It's five. I can't read that. Shirts. Brian's hold little bit side. It looks like fucking Hieroglyphs Joe, do you ever watch the king of the cage and glad you're challenged stuff now or is it just, it's not even, it's not what it used be back

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       when I was starting, when I was in gladder challenging king of the case. That was the only other show in town, right? It was like the UFC and then them and then whatever's in Japan.

Speaker 1:          01:26:12       I still watch a small fights though, are still watching. Hd Net has a lot of small organizations that uh, come on. They have, you know, you get to see like a rich Clemente. I just saw him fight and I just saw Dave branch and uh, Anthony Johnson there a fucking dude. He's got to weight cutting issue. Wow. I've never seen anybody up a weight class and they keep missing this Guy Anthony Rumble Johnson says incredibly talented guy. Weighs about two 30 ish before he begins his cut down to one 70 shit. I saw him walk through the hallway once in a, I'm in a hotel, we're all, I think it was in Denver. He was so god damn big. He wasn't fighting. You know, I couldn't believe how big he was. I was like, that dude is like a heavyweight. It's amazing that he can make one 70

Speaker 3:          01:27:00       it's crazy. Well I, the reason I asked is I remember, cause it's cool that you do watch his fights because I don't remember before I was in the WC or the UFC, I remember you saying something in recognizing me and, and, and like being like, Hey, I've seen you fight and this and that. Which I thought was the coolest thing in the world because, you know, it was like, man, these guys are watching. You know? And it's funny cause I was at a UFC in Sacramento and I had a fake pass made from my buddy Vinny, the hook think pass all the time. It was the best thing ever. It was in sac and I, uh, I had gotten in with the pass and then I just beeline straight through, act like I own the place and I'm in on the, in the circle with Dana, right, with Dana and Lorenzo and all you guys.

Speaker 3:          01:27:43       And Dana's like, hey, how are you having a good time kid? I'm like, yeah, having a good time, you know, and just chill out on the Internet in a little circle with my fake pass. Oh, that's awesome. And it was awesome. And then, uh, like because I was just at a point where I was making a name for myself and the low, the smaller shows that, you know, made a little bit of sense that I was there, you know what I mean? So people didn't really question it too much. Like you had, you had watched this a couple when I was on little paper views and stuff, but yeah, that was the first time I think.

Speaker 1:          01:28:11       Yeah, I'd seen you in the king of the cage. I saw you. I think I saw you live once and I saw you on TV or on. That was back when my friend bud own the king owned a piece of the candy case. So you guys had tapes laying around so I saw most of them. Eddie was doing commentary back then too. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:28:26       That's funny though. Dana was like, yeah, no, no idea. I was just walking around and they're like, I own the joint days. Like you having a good time kid. I'm like, yes.

Speaker 1:          01:28:34       Yeah, maybe. Yo, you were right. You did belong there. Look now here we are promoting a fucking huge fight. Belonged there. Of course you did. Absolutely. Now what, what is the date of your, uh, your fight with brow? It's a July 7th. July 7th. It's the same card is a Anderson Silva Chelsea on a rematch. That's going to be a crazy card. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:28:55       Yeah. It's going to be there. They've been moved to our card, which is awesome. Yeah. He's going to make it one of the biggest in UFC history. A huge card which goes into, those are two monster fire's right there. How did the, uh, how did the Jon Jones, Rashad Evans fight? Dude, you're pretty good on paper.

Speaker 5:          01:29:11       I think it did really well. I think they were surprised at how well it did. I think it exceeded expectations. I think be Jon Jones is, you know, obviously on his way to becoming a huge superstar. That's a, that's a rare gem of a talent right there. And that you see a guy who's been training for four years in MMA and he's, you know, choking Leo Machida unconscious like God damn.

Speaker 3:          01:29:31       But you know, his wrestling pedigree was really good. He was supposed to go with a scholarship to Iowa and you know, because he's, and he started his family instead. And uh, but he, he, he could have been a great rest or collegiate wrestler at a high level also. So,

Speaker 5:          01:29:46       no doubt. But what's impressing me is how God damn good at striking is. And how good God, how quick it got. Good. I mean it was great. It was great when he fought Stephan Bonner and he would fuck goose smile. He was, you know, his striking look good it but it, but it's become insane. You know, he out strikes shogun out strikes rampage and you know, it makes it look easy and that height and reach is so hard to fuck with men. Yeah. It's crazy man to have you talked to him since his situation he's Dui and for those who don't know, crashed into a pole apparently.

Speaker 3:          01:30:19       Yeah, he's, he uh, he's been hard to get ahold of. Like, you know, he's is a, he's like changes his number all the time and stuff like that. I really talked to him in a long time, not since I've seen him in person, but yeah, it's suck him. He's a young guy. I W I did an interview and they read me this thing that he said like a week before and uh, yeah, which is crazy and it makes me seem, almost makes me feel like he did it on purpose just to like, like add to the story. It's like, why would you be like, dude, I will, I'm so happy to do this because I will never get a Dui then like a week later, get it

Speaker 5:          01:30:57       Dui. That's crazy. I think it's pressure, man. I think, uh, especially if you're, you know, you're a young guy and you don't, you know, he's incredibly talented and the success must be overwhelming to a few years ago have gone from having to be a bouncer to take care of your, your girlfriend and your new baby, you know, and you're really worried about your future. So you decided to start fighting from that just a few years ago to drive in a Bentley top of the fucking world. Everybody wants to shake your hand and the world is stepping forward to John. John's a shake his hand and he's see him, he's got a glow around them. An Aura. That's a hard the management and it's hard.

Speaker 3:          01:31:35       Yeah. Was it hard for you? You know, it's not hard for me because I surround myself with the same people. Like, you know, my dad lives right next door to me and all my buddies. I mean I like my team of guys. We started together, you know, Joseph was mopping the mats that are at our gym and an amateur when he started. And Chad Mendez, I recruited out of college and Tj recruited out of college. Me and Danny Castillo were high school buddies. And um, I have the same people around me

Speaker 5:          01:32:03       and you guys all have, you have like a couple of houses and y'all live close to each other too.

Speaker 3:          01:32:07       Yeah. Or the overtime. It's starting to change now because guys are getting older and getting more money and getting married and getting all sorts of stuff. But we've had like a little commune that was, uh, it was really cool. We call it the block and, and uh, it's a tight knit group. You know, we have our, we have a charity golf tournament. We're having a charity golf tournament. It's the second annual we have, uh, that's a week after my fight. We have a end of the year banquet where we give out awards and like give speeches to everybody, to two guys and like real favorites and everybody gets dressed up. We have a big dinner.

Speaker 5:          01:32:37       So it's a whole gym. Everybody trains there. Is that what it is?

Speaker 3:          01:32:39       It's the whole team. And then whoever wants to buy a dinner to come and be a part of it and, and uh, we acknowledge everybody who does their, their, their little parts and, and we have like houseboat trip. So I mean it's like a real tight knit crew. So I mean, it's hard also when you got a guy like Tj Dillashaw for example, who just started training like two and a half years ago and I have a bad day and he's kicking the crap out of me. You know, it's like hard to get on a high horse, you know, it's like,

Speaker 5:          01:33:06       how did you start this whole commune thing? How did you, this the block, how did you, uh, I thought was, I saw once in one of the countdown shows. I was like that it's fucking cool. What a smart thing. Like surround yourself with a bunch of cool guys when you train with y'all live together,

Speaker 3:          01:33:20       right? It was, it was basically, so I talked about when I first graduated college, I started a little business top line coaching for kids and it, my coach at the time, Lenny's Leschi allowed me to run a summer of summer camps for the, uh, for the college through my business. And that gave me like $40,000 that went in and out and I got to keep like 3007 or something like that. But then I that established them some credit in the history work history and I ended up buying my first house when I was making on paper $7,000 a year.

Speaker 5:          01:33:55       Colin, he can buy a house shit.

Speaker 3:          01:33:57       So, you know, but I was hustling. I mean, I was always able to make money and I filled it with all my buddies to help pay the rent. And, uh, then my buddy Tommy, who's back there, he works for me full time. We knew each other in high school and college. He was just graduating and was out of a job or he wanted to buy a house house opened up next door and my other buddy bought that one. And then I started doing better about the house next door to that. My other buddy, uh, Sanchez who started out as like my nemesis in college, like we were enemies like two and two. My senior year, he's like put me out of my senior year in college. Like only got to make me cry and competition cause it was like the end of my college career, he ends up coming and taking my spot at Uc Davis and living with me renting a room. Wow. And then he starts managing my gym and then we bought another house right there together. I put the down payment, he makes the payments and he started a little business in there. This is all my book. You're going to love my book by the way. It's, it's money lost. But, uh, so

Speaker 5:          01:34:55       he starts the name of it for everybody. The business,

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       the book of the books, laws of the ring, your I laws and the laws of the ring. Yeah. And it's all these, it's all these theories about community and personal credit and, and positive attitude. That's the motivational book really. Yeah. Awesome. So it's not just a, this is how I, you know, became successful.

Speaker 3:          01:35:15       There it is right there. And uh, so, so Sanchez starts, this starts this company in one of our garages, like maintaining bank owned property lawns and next thing you know, he's the largest company in the u s right now for that. He's just caked out.

Speaker 4:          01:35:35       So cat, he just becomes like a crazy lawnmower guy. He's, he's mowing lawns from Hawaii to Iowa to really,

Speaker 3:          01:35:43       he did, they do like 33,000 or 35,000 some stupid number. And that's all on the block. And we've had all sorts of stuff that's come off the block. Chad Mendez lives on the block. Tj Dillashaw. We've had like 30 guys, Korean Zombie came and stayed out there. How many houses is it? It's four houses right next to each other. And then there's one house that's my college buddy that's about a block and a half.

Speaker 4:          01:36:08       That's so bad ass to have so many people around you that you can count on all the time too. You know, he trained with, you know him, he can count on them. Yeah, it's awesome.

Speaker 3:          01:36:17       It's cost me some money over the years, like being the bank for these guys now you know, guys aren't always a pay rent and stuff like that, but I mean it built something today that's super solid. I mean our team now is one of the top in the world and uh, you know, it was all part of that carpooling to the gym and you know, if you need to go, you have no food, go to one of the houses and

Speaker 4:          01:36:37       take somebody else's. I mean man, as long as everybody is actually contributing. Right. And everybody has a place in a function and a part of it. Yeah. Now you, you have a gym, you have your own gym set up and what does, what does your gym called its ultimate fitness, ultimate fitness. And regular people can go and train there as well. It's like you have classes and shit. Yeah we have like

Speaker 3:          01:36:58       uh, we have, you know, quite a few, quite a few members, like 400 something members and it's been around five years now. We've, we've, you know, grown it. It's, it's got a great reputation. It's pretty bad.

Speaker 4:          01:37:12       Do you, are you the one who's managing everything? Like do you make your own training scheduled that you put everything together? Do you have like an MMA coach who handles like when you're going to do more anti, when you're going to wrestle, when you're going to combine them, do you have someone who analyzes you?

Speaker 3:          01:37:26       We have like a, we have a team schedule and then I have my individual coaches. Like I have a Jujitsu coach, have a master tongs, my standup coach and, and we have set times with our team where we ever team practices that are pretty structured. And then we have our individual stuff that we do outside of it. So I'll do, you know, the set practices, which are the pro practices three days a week in the morning. And then two days of sparring and then we have two days of Jujitsu and then everything else is of mix and

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       match. We have a ricin class for guys that need to do more wrestling. But you don't have a person who sets it all up for you. You do it all for yourself. How much you, um, you set your own strength and conditioning schedule or did you bring in a guy for that? I've got a guy, well I've got an individual coaches for everything. I've got a Russell Dunning's, my strength and conditioning guy. He's my physical therapist. And the how do you decide, like when you go to him, when you do Moitai, how do you do it by your body? Do you do it by what you know from your experience? I said a general schedule and then listen to my body outside of that. So if I feel like I need to do more or less, I'll do more or less. But um, like said it a general schedule that I know is always going to be there.

Speaker 4:          01:38:36       And then if I need to take a day off, I'll just let someone know or if I need to do more, I'll just call someone up and we all kind of do that same thing at the team. You know? It's like, uh, we have all these different things available and you can hit them all. That's what, that's what makes our team really unique is we're training all year round. If you don't have a fight and you're in town, like you just go to practice, you know it's, it's what you do. Everybody trains. Nobody takes time off and gets fat and stupid, but you can't. Yeah. You can't anymore. I can't chat. Everyone has to be improving too. Right? Yeah. This is the biggest gains like that. Isn't that incredible for you to watch when you started fighting to today and see how crazy the sport has become me?

Speaker 4:          01:39:16       I remember when I used to watch, you know, when I saw your fights and king of the cage or back in that day, nobody knew what the fuck cage fighting was. No, it was crazy. I was like embarrassed. It wasn't like you could pick up chicks, at least the chicks. I like. You can pick up chicks by Tom. You're a cage fighter. How they were thinking about a piece of shit. Human dog keep that on the DL, you know, they get to know you better now it's like chic. I saw this video with Charlise thrawn and she was talking about how much she loves the UFC and I was like, how fucking tweet did you tweet that? No, no, no, no. It's on the underground. It was a mighty, well a lot of people tweeted, I think because the video was her on the Conan O'brien show and she was talking about how much she loves watching filing and he could see Colin like he's a little bit uncomfortable with it.

Speaker 4:          01:40:04       You know, cause like when chicks start talking about like fucking savage men beating the fuck a guy like Conan, like on, uh Huh. Yeah, he doesn't even want to know that exists. He certainly doesn't want them to be coming out of the mouth of the, one of the most beautiful women in the world. What he's trying to impress her. Hey, that's mother nature though. It's a bench goes back to, uh, to the old instincts, the wounded, the wounded antelope, this trace by the waterhole get live forever, bitch. It is what it is. That's, how did you come up with the name Alpha male Alpha male? I, while I was a human development major and I just was studying all this different stuff in school and I just liked what it represented. You know what I, you know, took cultural anthropology, physical anthropology and all these different development classes and stuff like that. Like my whole was just about

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       people, you know, and, and things and how things happen, you know. And uh, I remember learning about these birds. Like there's these, there's this certain type of bird where these three birds land and the two sidekicks, they all do this dance together and then the two side kicks, kick rocks in the middle one gets laid, you know, it's like, it's choreographed. These guys might have their opportunity at sometime when it steps up and it's their turn. And then they talk about like these packs of wolves that work together as a team. And then there's like the, the big macho gorilla that that like is spreading a seat in. And there's like the little sneak dick monkeys, the guys that look at your runs in and gets his hump in and like all these different crazy stuff. And like, it was just interesting to me about how in humans there's this Alpha males in every category. I mean there's an Alpha male ballerina, there's an Alpha male, a frigging gay dude, there's an Alpha Male, you know, whatever. There's this like the top dog in every category in, it's kind of trips me out of how they are, but it takes like being smart, being good looking and being persuasive, being hardworking and being, you know, all these great things. And I figured that's the shit.

Speaker 1:          01:42:05       It is honest in its approach. I mean, that is what everybody is trying to do. Whereas you know you, you can, you can name it a bunch of different things. But yeah, it is trying to be the Alpha male. It's been the connotation of the word that's sort of changed lately. It's gotten, it's become a tad douchey. The word Alpha you, it's like a, you know, to do that. So Alpha, I like people like rag on you from that. You never heard anybody say that. That's, people say that on online. A lot like to rag on you for something to that. So Beta, you're a Beta, you're being a Beta Alpha and Beta is like a, it's a, it's a very, oh that's right Brian. It's kind of recent. I mean I say that obviously because we have a alpha brain, it opens itself up to criticism. That is what you're doing man. You're, you're, you're Alpha male and the motherfucking shit out of dudes.

Speaker 3:          01:42:51       Yeah. And I mean it basically that's what it comes down and like who's it takes all that. So he takes like intelligence, athleticism, some hard work, dedication and like you know the guys that rise to the top in anything are, you know, made up of that same stuff. Whether it's like the top writer, the top journalists, the top anything

Speaker 1:          01:43:07       they are. But I think that one of the most difficult past in the world is the one that you've found success in. I think you are in one of the most difficult businesses on the planet earth. It's

Speaker 3:          01:43:15       rough if it's not physically, it's mentally taxing. It's, it's a financially taxing when you're getting going and that's, that's the crazy thing. I actually want to talk about that. I've got a new thing that Phil Davis and I are starting called MMA draft and we've been working on it for a long time, but it's basically going to create opportunities for these up and comers. It's like MMA draft is going to take a guy like Phil Davis was a national champion and start following his career when he's a kid. Give him opportunity to like shine as a kid and be like, these are the top MMA prospects and start covering all these different amateur sides, Jujitsu, wrestling, uh, I think we should even cover some soccer stuff. And there's so many soccer athletes coming in there kicking man, just the deck story with the legs and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          01:44:02       But they need to start, we need to start finding like the next tiger woods and Lebron James and Michael Jordans of our sport and watch them grow up as kids so that when a guy like Phil or a guy like, uh, you know Chad Mendez who's a national finalists or Lance Palmer who's a national finalists and wrestling, it doesn't have to wash dishes and mow lawns for the first four or five fights before there's an opportunity there. So developing this whole a website where we're, we're, we're having criteria and we're having like profiles and we're going to create some ourselves and do our scouting and like cover events of kids from youth all the way through, you know, the international wrestling and Jujitsu and kickboxing and amateur leagues. It. Dude, it's going to be crazy or we have a temporary side of right now. You can check it out and what does it MMA draft.com [inaudible] dot com but we're working on it. It's good. It's going to be sweet and one more time. Your book is laws of the ring laws of the ring and they can get that on amazon.com Amazon on, I'm actually doing a signing tonight at Barnes and nobles in Huntington. Me leaving right now to go to that. You're going to have to get on the fucking terrible highway of five o'clock in the Los Angeles. Yeah, that's rough.
