Speaker 1:          00:00:04       That's fresh.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Yes, we're live. Ladies and gentlemen, we're live and we're here to talk about Brendan Schaub shoes. Those fucking shoes that you wore to the Mayweather. Mcgregor fight. What in the fuck you bought? Those are they, someone gave new and some opinion. Aware. Yeah. Fill me duties. Paying me like Jared Leto sense what? Brian sent you a video of him. I was like, Oh God, he's going to judge me. He's going to judge me so hard and it's part of you though. I like it, man. Fanny pack. I got to shut the fuck up no matter any, any time where there's any sort of fashion discussion. I just got to shut the fuck on. He backs make sense though. The only, the only tap shoes you are you like a handmade from from Britain are delicious. Lots of black hole. What the fuck is that about? Game of Thrones shits.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       I'm Khaleesi buckle that. I just can't get a number. What's the beat and the bag? Is that a B? It's a gold be sun. I get more cots. Gold? Yeah. Is this like one of those that black or blue dress thing or it just looks weird picture. I get more compliments on the shoes then any shoe I've ever had. And then hold on. Mr. Ryan, you, you're six foot four gorilla scared of no j Lo I saw Jayla she goes up your shoes. She goes, I love your shoes. I want, she does. She's a check the check station code sign while she's probably also trying to make a rod jealous cause they probably been together long enough where she's starting to feel bored. Yeah, he, Raj was just trying to basic the crackle going Jamie, does that look like gold to you or am I going blind?

Speaker 2:          00:01:37       That's a gold beach. Go, go back up to that. Let's go ahead and see that the bucket was like silver. Yeah, I guess so. Go Lock. Make it larger on that. Oh is it? I mean I just don't get the hate on those but I'm looking at him and they are gorgeous. It's so gross. And then on top of them being gross, they have sneaker lasers which makes him even more stupid ass. It's just not for you. I guess. It's like a light gold. I'm thinking of like, you know like hold on that one. Oh No, you're right. How? Wow. Wow. Those are gold TV suck. Is it a contrast then? That one looks different. That one's better. That looks totally like good. I have to walk the red carpet after Bruce Willis in those shoes and some guy goes, killer boots man. Like a dumb and dumber.

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       I'm like, yeah, Bruce Willis, that old ass can't pull these off. Everyone started laughing, but I think he heard it. I was like, Oh, Mr. Die hard. Please, please don't. Please don't judge me, but I will. We'll kick you and these things don't get it twisted. The St the movies. Yeah. There's something about like leaving that foot, that buckle mark on someone's forehead. Embarrassing just for claim guy and skinny jeans and those boots whooped your ass. That's embarrassing. Do you remember when Pete Williams had kicked Mark Coleman? Oh my God. It was just like, why can't the world sound like a bat? It was a, it was also like one of like what the fuck? Like, who saw that comment? Like we thought that Pete who was a young guy is dealing with Coleman who was just all super gorilla, Super Carrillo and then you know, Pete wore his ass out and landed that perfectly place head kick.

Speaker 2:          00:03:14       If he had that buck on dead, you would see that mark forever. That Gucci. Gucci. Yeah. I mean Pika, I'm tired people. I'm such a bad mother fucker back here it is. Boom. Got that Async label on his face though. Yeah. Damn Joy. The may six, that was a big, that was a bad week when, damn that dude is steak and chicken drug tests. See that. If you had that mark like that, like your boots on boom. And just I'm thinking Hootchie Gootchie baby. Yeah. If you notice Pete kicked him to choose on last fights that you can kick people. He thinks I'm more like with the point. Yeah. Hell yeah. Uh, doing a wheel kick, like a spinning heel. Chicken some boots. Yeah, I guess. I think with the heel kicked out, quite honestly doesn't, I don't think it matters. It lands, it lands well. It's so there's so much power in that cake.

Speaker 2:          00:04:09       And if you land, you're landing with your heel and your heel can, it's not like a knuckle at breaks and he never break your, he'll never, I did hit somebody wants so hard that my foot was sore and I was limping for a couple days where the heel kick with a heel kiss was horrible. It was hit the hell out of them. He went to sleep for a long time. They took him to the house. It was scary. I was 19. That's bad. I think I didn't tell you this story is a fucked up story because it made me reconsider. Fighting wrote and killed. He guy was this a thing I said to my instructor because my instructor wasn't there cause he's in California. I was in, I was in Boston and uh, he goes, I heard you had a really good knockout, you know, exact same.

Speaker 2:          00:04:46       Yeah. And I go, yeah, it was, it was scary. I go a condom with a wheel kick and I go and he just didn't get up and I thought he was dead. He goes, sometimes they die. And walks away. Dead serious. Dead serious. Yeah. He was training troops. Old School. Yeah. He didn't care at all and I was like, but wait a minute. They died. I'm them. I'm, hey man. I got for sure disposable. I wasn't the best for sure. Somebody get a fuck me. I never got head kicked, but I saw people that I was close to get head kicked in. Ever get killed in tournaments. Just Tko. Tko boxing match and kickboxing match where they stopped. You got rock, then he came in and stopped it. Yeah. I got rock with a left hook. I got my legs just shut off point. Where does that, it's the weirdest feeling of all time. What people think is that like it hurts. No liver shot hurts. Like if you get kicked to the liver or punched in the liver and your whole body will die and your legs kind of give out, that hurts. But this is a weird thing about getting hit on the chin. It's like everything just goes surreal feeling. Yeah. Just stops working and let my body would get hot.

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       It's a weird word. The worst man. What is it like to get completely flatlined? Um, it, it's nothing because you don't, you don't feel anything. Right. So you don't feel anything. You don't, when you come out of it. What's your, what's your most recent memory? Not much. Everything's a little, a little like fuzzy. And then someone tells you what happened and then you remember certain parts of the fight. Like God, I remember doing that and that and then what happened? You know what I'm saying? Like you have to piece it, like puzzle it together. This is one. And then you get in the back, cause there's, there's two type of people that when you get concussed or flatline in my experiences, you react to it two ways. One, you get really emotional, like heartbroken, sat like super, Super Sad. The other gets really, really upset, like mad super mad.

Speaker 2:          00:06:47       And I, I, I've always seen those two opposites new thing. It is this from concussed or is this from the emotions of losing and realizing you lost after it's all over? I think it's a combination of both. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. But this is one of the reasons why I want to bring this up is because everybody always wants to talk about the power of belief, you know, and how important the power of belief is. And it's super important. You know, instead it's a big factor. And Connor success is this like insane belief he has in himself. But even with the power of belief at 10 you still have to deal with the limitations to the body. Correct. And you still have to deal with like what is the reality of getting hit on the chin? Correct. But that, that self belief that Connor has got him into the biggest fight in combat sports history on her feet and had a little bit of doubt.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       We're not here. You're 100% you're talking about them. I know. So it's a fine line say ah, self belief only goes so far, man. Even myself, I myself belief was so high private match my skills, but I was so confident I could beat anyone in the world. I beat a lot of guys that probably had no business beating or just getting through the beat cro cop. He's a legend and you beat him by knockout. Yeah, but like get getting through golden gloves. Man. I thought I was the next Mike Tyson. I brought, probably not, but I beat most of those guys. Just stuff. Sure. Whale. But I believed in my heart of hearts I was going to be the best of all time. No, you were a competitor. And there's some people that have a hard time with the big moment. Conor obviously shines in the big moment, but at the end of the day, even with that insane belief, you get to see his physical limitations.

Speaker 2:          00:08:23       But what you got to see though is, well, you got to see a lot in that fight, but you don't know what's going to happen until they do it. That's why I didn't fight. So he has this amazing, uh, belief in himself and he had a really interesting style man, that whole thing where he was doing like putting his hands out there and, and pap pap pap and them. Yeah. And then throwing off offspeed punches and then drop out. And his ankles were so good, so good and and so exaggerated in big huge get Floyd's back and Floyd. Scary, smart. He wouldn't turn into him. They give him more of an angle. He just cover up because you had the ref was going to stop it. The real MVP of that fight, granted, you know Conor and Floyd, that Raf, oh, I read them fine.

Speaker 2:          00:09:06       You're the real MVP. Panted he came, his opening dialogue with the hell was that he was just staring at Mcgregor like now we don't want to know that that gay Raslan in just like students. I don't think he said that. I think I thought he was way over the top. I wanted the fight to start, so I thought he was over the top because I wanted to fight. Come on, let's go with this fucking national anthem. Do you do that in a locked room? But I just thought it was off to the wrong foot, but I think he, granted, I don't think Connor was going to win that fight as it went on. However he, the Connor did have an advantage if they went in tight heat, even let it get there yet grappling under hooks. What, and that was where Conor was going to get his rest.

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       He didn't have that opportunity as soon as they got to that ref separated. Yeah, it was good. He was gonna let him fight it. Yeah, he was in London fight though. He was the perfect rest. However, I think Connor thought you'd be able to get his rest in those moments and just never was capable of doing it cause the ref would, I think he got more tired than he ever thought it was going to or down to. Also the efficiency of Floyd. Here's what I did. I watched it live from the third round on. I got offstage, Washington DC, the first two I ran upstate. I did last yesterday. I watched it yesterday when I get home, but I flew home. Um, our mayor flew upstairs. It was that they had it on paper view in the upstairs green rooms. So we ran upstairs type move.

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       Yeah, it was, but I caught on the third round and yell and Ian Edwards, I'm like, I'm like, how's it going? He goes, the fights. Great. This is a great fight. So I got in there like writing it. I didn't want to give, this is people waiting in line a long time. The show started late. People bought tickets months in advance and I'm like, I'm not cut my show short. Yeah, I'm going to do the full show and then I'm gonna thank everybody good night and then watch the fight for a better person. So I ran upstairs and uh, I got in the third round so I didn't see all the, the speech until I heard about it afterwards so that I heard it. I tried to watch from the time they were both walking out, but the national and um, stop. I love America. I'm not mad at Demi Lovato. She can sing when ever she would go to a concert. It's an American flag. It's on my phone. Okay. I love America. Love it. I'm a big proponent in the best aspects of America, but to see, I like the rocket's red glare and the bumps.

Speaker 2:          00:11:24       I couldn't get enough. I was standing ovation. Bravo. She's a beautiful singer. No doubt in her shit from a teleprompter though. Well, it's probably a good move. You don't want to fuck it up. Like who fucked it up? Miley Cyrus and she fucked it up. There's been some people that fucking, somebody forgot the words. Somebody fucked, fucked up the words. Oh, Christina Aguilera. That's who it was that her, that was Christina when she was, she was going through a tough time, which got a little heavy back then. Remember that? Yeah. She got heavy. Christina, like unsexy,

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       thick. Like she got a little over the line to like, what's going on to too many supersizes. It's not just that like when someone gets that big that quick, you start thinking about depression. You know that wasn't Roseanne Barr. Well, you know what she did though? That was back in the day when Roseanne was on top of the world. She grabbed a pussy and spit, which is hilarious. Yeah. She's so sad. As a savage of savages and people got Super Mad at her and this was pre social media, but, but click on the youtube link to that. Find out what or if it says there, when Roseanne did it, [inaudible] year was 1990 and nine Diego. Yeah. See totally before the Internet spits on the ground right before. Why not? She's an animal. She's an adult. She's an animal. I love her. You know Whitney is like executive producing her new show.

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       That makes sense. Totally makes sense. Yeah. And Whitney's like, she's a great joke writer to phenomenal writer and probably, I mean I got a fee. I don't, I don't remember really talking to her too much about Roseanne. Maybe we did. I look at that. She grabbed her pussy. It's Spanish traces. I maintained she one of the top most important comedians of all time after I said that to her when she was here, I said, you changed the face of women's comedy. She did. She changed the face of women's College. She got her start in Denver son. Yes, she did. Comedy works, comedy works. She's a beast with kids at all. Those kids graduated and a dad moving out hit the whole deal and the animal fucking animal. I like her. Yeah. Oh, we're talking about they're doing a show together. But I got, what I was going to say is that I gotta think that Whitney must think about it the same way most of most of the comics do.

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       She's super respected. Rosanna mean super respect. That's a big job for Whitney. Fuck yeah, that's huge. That has a potential, especially right now, like what the Hell is on TV? I agree. You know, you got Kevin. James has a sitcom name and others had come. Ready, go. I got nothing. I got nothing. Goldberg's I'll tell you what. I did start watching. I started watching Ozark. Oh my God. It's good. Those are, what was arc on Netflix? Oh, Justin Bateman chasing, chasing, chasing baby. He gets involved with the cartel. Yep. Seen it. I just saw the dude, dude, I'll hold up. I'm on season four of game of Thrones balls deep and who don't, I cannot get the Dragon Tattoo. And I was talking all that stay offline. Uh, people try to send me spoilers. Ain't happening son. I don't even look at them. Yeah, you gotta be an engine.

Speaker 3:          00:14:18       Just the biggest Khaleesi fan. I will just wait. Oh, I can't wait. The queen of dragons. Just wait. Those dragons. John's know this. I know I'm going to say anything but this season finale, just Jesus Christ and then I see people online where the g game of Thrones lost its way. I'm like, how about you fuck off. How about you, him haters. Everyone's going to hate on anything, man. I'll tell you what. The white walkers though, I'm on season three. Them graphics were tough on, see it looked like a tare out there. That's like white things. Get to season seven I saw can fund. I saw one. They look like some super beast. Oh yeah. They've got that wired. They know how to do it at an ice wall and the game is that real? There's like a shut the fuck up. It's like the flat earth, right?

Speaker 3:          00:14:59       Let me start there. The same thing or it's not the same across the wall. I mean, I think it's in the north. In the north. You've got to keep a war. How good is it? It's fucking phenomenal. I'm so happy I was. I'm telling you I could not sleep. I was so happy that King Joffrey died. That little bitch. Spoiler alert. Hey Bro, they're on season seven, five years. Three alert. People will get mad. How dare you Shab I'm on season one. If it's more than three years old, I'm allowed to talk about it for sure. People get mad if you talk about something that happened 10 years ago though. They get mad like if they haven't seen it, it's like you're not supposed to discuss things. Hey Bro. How to, yeah. Yeah. I love it though. I'm obsessed with game of Thrones. All I watch right now, it's the best show of all time. I think the writing, but I'll say that about other shows to me to say that I get excited. Me Too. I'll throw that out no matter what. If I get enthusiastic, don't hold me to it. I'm not some fucking ranking committee. You know what I mean? He's like the UFC ranking. You know what? We're like to use rings. We just throw up whatever you want.

Speaker 3:          00:16:11       However I feel I'm just going to do that. All right. Give it to us number one next week. I don't know. We'll see. I think Max Kellerman is walking around today. How many people are fucking with him? I saw him this morning. Hundred Mcgregor will not land a single punch. Meanwhile, he landed more punches on Floyd Mayweather. An any boxer ever than many Pacquiao and Miguel Cotto. Yeah. And then people go, oh, this is a fricking Max is a debate. Oh, well that's because Floyd led them. That was his style. Hey man, let's give Connor sub credit some credit. His pace was so high. I think cottage pace was so high and he thought it was me landing more shots. He just wore himself out. He's a little bit of that. I think there's a little bit of an efficiency issue that you know, John, Donna, her go to John Donahoe, his Instagram page, please.

Speaker 3:          00:16:57       John Donner, who's, um, you know, one of the best grapplers you to master World Jujitsu mastermind. He's also a brilliant guy. He's like Elon Musk of Jujitsu, basically cap, super smart, innovative guy. But on top of that, he wrote an assessment of how he thinks the fight's going to play out. And it was to at t spot on about the cardio. Is that um, Donna her said that he was gonna um, stop him sometime, uh, after the fifth round. What does it say? Yeah. Tonight is the biggest night BP. BP. Oh Man. It's the way to long John. Well, he does that. He's just too small. Well, it's hey, but create a blog though, huh? You know? Yeah. I mean basically he said here I consider a fine a victory for Mr Mcgregor if he survived 12 rounds. Yeah. See, scroll up a little bit and he'll explain how he said that it usually works. Yeah. Here it goes. They are quite competitive. The first three to four

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       rounds and he surprisingly, well then around the fifth round, the elite boxer begins to figure out the unorthodox were awkward movement and begins to employ ring craft tactics, attire, the MMA athlete by making more harder than he is making mispunches et cetera. Around the eighth round. A very noticeable shift occurs where the elite boxer takes over. I expect a similar pattern tonight though. Probably taking less time given the incredible skill lever, Mr Mayweather. But it was the exact thing around the eighth round May, whether it was clearly shaken over the ninth round May, whether it was getting was fucking Connor off was teeing off on Connor and I actually texted to my friend in between rounds. I'm like, he's done. They're going to stop. I gotta stop last round. They threatened to go to the, to the back to do some for showtime. I was like, it's over.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       They wouldn't let you know. They did. That made you go, you gotta go back. You miss some of it. Well, I didn't want to see it really. I knew it was over. Yeah. So then, but then they put me Kate side. I was, wait, weren't, you didn't want to see it? Uh, not really. I knew what was happening. I just, I dunno. I Dunno. How could you not want to see it? I knew what I was going to happen. I then she would watch rocky movies, Bro. I wish, man, but I'm glad they stopped it early. I wasn't mad at the stoppage. I wasn't either. I wasn't mad cause for number of reasons, but he has a lot more fight left in and there's no, we got it. You got it. Connor did well. He wants some rounds. He's going to get fucked up in the next round if he made it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:07       If he made into 11th Floyd Mayweather was going to fuck him up. Correct. Like real bad. He was gas in. But you're Connor and even Floyd afterwards he goes, Floyd, they go, what was the most surprising thing about this fight? And he goes, collars, box and skills. Honestly, I thought I'd be able to take over early, but I wasn't able to because of his boxing skills. He goes, I wasn't surprised by his power. There wasn't much power there, which is, you know, whatever. He ate that upper flow straight up flush up or kept from Connor. But Conor did not seem like he was putting a lot of power in its punches. It looks like he was trying to be like real active, but then also he was like kind of winging them too while he was hitting him with some weird stuff like this. And he'd even did a bunch of Hammerfest and stuff. Did you know for every illegal shot that he, if he got [inaudible] for $10 million out of his purse, 10 Mil. So when everyone's like, how do you know he's just not going to throw a knee or an elbow, like a savage, like, well, there's 10 million reasons why I get mail hairdresser that that was the media I dealt with a media row. All how, you know, he's just not going to throw a knee and flip out.

Speaker 2:          00:20:11       How do you know Brendon? How do you know he's not going to need him? Right. And then people saw it and I'd have to go from having now, even now, isn't it funny that there's no idea as a gay voice, like if you do that voice, everyone knows it's a game. There's not a lesbian. There's, well, there's really not a butch lesbian. Oh, that seems to be a female truck driver that loves Dick Smokes. Marlboro is every hour. Leroy's it doesn't necessarily mean she's a lesbian. Yeah. Large March. March, March, March. Yes. Greg Roberts

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       large. That's what I was Sturge bars. Sencha I was terrified. A large march. You really, the big blue balls poke out dude. Peewee's big adventure, right? First one. First one yet. God Damn. If she was scary. Great movie. Yeah, man. Oh, we can hear it. He's all freaked out and when they finally pulled the drivers, Johnny, I love that movie. I'm so glad you got that reference dude. Peewee's big adventure was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid. I went with my high school girlfriend. We went and we were fucking crying. We just couldn't believe how hard we were laughing. It was so good, man. It was so silly. Then the next one after that was a big Top, big top pee. Wee pig is a little pig. That was his best friend. Feed them sandwiches and shit while he's trying to get with that girl.

Speaker 3:          00:22:07       Is he silly fucking movie? If you've never seen that movie and you smoke weed, you are in luck. Large March. Just fire one up. Makes a cameo though. She's not there for long. Long enough. It'd be nice. We're still talking to that movie came out in like 84 right? 1989 that's when the show came out because I was born in 83 pull it up, pull it up because I was in high school, say early nineties man, my mom had the VHS. It's all we'd watch. I graduated high school in [inaudible] 85 and this is, uh, my high school girlfriend and I went to see it. Mm. Maybe she was in high school. Whoa. Oh Damn. Joe Rogan. 1985 c Sun. I was, I 100% remember being in high school and she was in high school. We were both in school and we went to see it. Wow. Powerful Giotto.

Speaker 3:          00:22:59       His bike was sick. Was that was before the TV show or, I don't know, man. I think the TV show was out before that. A kid show, I guess. I mean the kids that a HBO special. Oh yeah. That was later. That was later. I think he does that show up like straight up ABC though. Remember? I would watch it in the mornings. Why? I was saying I was, I thought it was after that he was house and then he got caught like jacking off to the theater. Right. That was actually after all that he got caught Jackin off after he stopped doing the TV show. Really? I thought it was like in the middle of the nineties I was like 90 rolling. How's this crew going to take an l? Just cause he jacked off in a movie theater. Yeah. That was back in the day where we already had VHS.

Speaker 3:          00:23:36       Like if you jacked off and it was in a movie theater, that was the only way to jack off. Everybody's like, Eh, we understand. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Give the guy a break. But if you jack off in a movie theater when we have VHS, well you're a pervert. 91 damn arrested for masturbating and an adult theater in [inaudible] 91 that's so crazy. What was the movie? Sarasota. Florida is the problem. They had a fucking thing in Sarasota and how do they know that he really did jack off. He was right. Really? We're turning up the heat and tiger shark. Nancy nurse was another one. Then he went to see, uh Oh, okay, well that's what people do in those days. He was only 38 at the time. 38 he's the most shot out. 38 year old ever seen. Look at that picture. This picture, it looks like it's like, I like the blogger at the set of hair on him too.

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       It looks like a blogger. Jack's off the guys in a band. He could totally be like a bass player. Was He smart? Is he just loaded or what? Because he was a big deal when I was a kid. Dad Merchandise and everything man. Well, he took a big hit from this. I think if it happened today it would be no big deal. But also part of the problem was that he was like a childhood idol thing because you know his show was a kid show even though it was kind of adult themed in a lot of a way. A lot of ways. So word of the day. Yeah. See the HBO Cable Television Show popularized by [inaudible] in 1982. Yeah. He would look up girls skirts with the aid of mirror as attached to his shoes. He was like, your regional character. He's a creep. Why QE? We taught kids how to do that.

Speaker 3:          00:25:10       Basically. That's fucked up. But everybody already knew back then. Start a fire with a match. Yeah. It's all good, man. Do you know what I think people get figured out how to put a fucking mirror on your shoe. That was an old movies man. But then he just, uh, he just shot a show for Netflix. Did it like they made a movie like periods back, right? Yup. Yup. Wow. That's a long hiatus. They took them that long to recover. You know what? That little too late. You know, like way too late. That's like entourage came with that movie like 10 years after the finale. Come on, man. Why they do that? It'd take a long time to make the movie. I don't know. Personalities didn't show. We do really well though. I don't think so. The entourage movie rotten tomatoes gives it like a zero bad but didn't do as good as they needed it to or did not do well.

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       The critics destroyed that thing. It was just too late. Men yet turtle. He's 50 on that bitch. It's like sex and the city can go back today and chicks were flocked to it weren't people piss it a six and the city movie, they might have been, well you don't like cause they can do it with them. They go through like menopause and shit the name right, right, right. Like the young chicks anymore chasing Dick. Well you know it was weird. It was like that one character of the, what's her name? Samantha? Yeah, the slutty character. Straight up whore. Yeah. It gave like a lot of women like they can go. Yeah, she could do it and I love her. Why can't I do it? That's why everyone can relate to that shit. Like was the smart one. There's one that career driven was the whore and you had one of your friends was one of them I feel like. But they loved their horror friend. Yeah. So it was like, it gave her it like it was opposite of slut shaming.

Speaker 2:          00:26:45       Be Yourself. Let your freak flag fly. Be like, Samantha, everybody's not Samantha, but Samantha's not everybody like B or whoever the fuck you are. Who are you? If you're, if you're a super freak and you're around a bunch of squares and then he was holding it back, get some strange deck. I'll give you this, that check. So once it go, just drink a couple of cosmopolitans. Throw some guy. You're fucking kidding. Go. Let's go. Yeah man. What's wrong with that? So let's rock songs. Yeah. As long as it's not your daughter, you're good. Yeah. Well it's also, as long as you don't run into the wrong dude, that would be the big fear of being a woman, running into some fucking scary guy, sending bad murderers, rapists, terrible person. Like you're way more likely to run into that person as a woman, then you are sure.

Speaker 2:          00:27:30       Male predators, predators drank on Samantha, dropping, shitting your drinks, you know, dropping shit into drinks. That's so rampant. If I was a girl, I would be terrified of that. I've met so many people that have told me stories about a guy drug in them or drug and one of their friends or drug drugging someone they know. I thought it was like an old school thing, but still goes on kind of a friend. She told me, yeah, she was out at the club and she goes, and then I woke up. Luckily nothing happened, but I woke up no memory of what happened before. I'm like, yeah man in La, like that's still happening. She's like, yeah, 100% why the fuck would you take a drink from a dude though? Like you should be. You know what I'm saying? Well, it should be like friendly people. Like, Hey, would you like a beer?

Speaker 2:          00:28:13       Yeah, sure. Give you a beer. It should be. That's how it should be. Should be. I mean, I, ideal circumstances, she should be able to, but there's just too many creeps. The world we live in. Like what'd you tell your daughters when they're old enough? Like, Hey, do not take a drink unless you're, you know what I'm saying? Of course. That's what the world we live in. You can't just, it's not, it's not worth the risk. I mean, hopefully you're going to run into only nice people who give you a drink and they just want to have some drinks with friends and have some laughs. Have you ever heard of girls Roofie to dude? Never, but I'm sure it's happened. I did. Here we will. You always heard that story about like the fake urban myth about the Russian girl who, uh, gets you drank and it takes you back to your own kidney and then you wake up.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       Yeah. Such a bag of ice. You wake up with a bag of ice on your side and stitches. It tells you to get to a hospital immediately. Like what is that an urban legend could be. I mean, when never happened. That's brings up Jamie's point early today before the podcast that we need a more reliable Snopes. Yeah. Not that Snopes is a reliable cause apparently it's pretty, pretty reliable, but nobody is what the problem is. Nobody wants to listen to Snopes anymore because it turned out that the dude who rants Snopes is a freak and like one of the chicks that is like his number one employee was a woman who was an escort until like 2015 and now she's married to him and he's just a freak. He's just partying all the time, having a good old time. But why is that so bad? Like why does that affect, and also they have a left lane left wing bias that a lot of people, a lot of people think they have a left wing bias at least.

Speaker 2:          00:29:44       Yeah, I guess sort of maybe, but I mean if they're just relaying facts you can rely on them I think for the most part. But that's not enough. Who can you rely on? Like even on the New York Times you post on Instagram, do you see they changed their headache, they changed it, they changed it. I went out of my way. I was like, this is crazy. I read the New York Times basically every day. It should be me too. It should be pretty reliable. I have it on my app, on my phone, my phone. Yeah. That's where I go in the morning. Yeah. I get notifications from them. Take time to anything happens in the news. So I read tons of articles from the New York Times. Do you see the guy I looked up that explains to them? No, I didn't. Wanna I didn't wanna like get personal.

Speaker 2:          00:30:22       No, I just wanted to see what was going on. It just a giant fuck up. You can't do that. He's also not a sports writer. He writes more about race. He's a young guy, you know. I doubt it. Flight. Yeah. He Goes New York Times writer for race. Why? Yeah. That seems like it would be within your best interest to keep things fucked up, you know? I'm not saying maybe that's why he's here. You know, like who the hell maybe. I mean, look you, all you had to know was say what happened is that after, uh, you know, just say Floyd Maguire, Mcgregor, Floyd Mayweather out classes and stops Conor McGregor, it stops and exhausted Conor McGregor and the 10th round. That's what happened. He was exhausted. And he got tagged over and over again, and Floyd was teeing off on him and his brilliant performances that really paint the f the fight though I, I dunno if I'll put it in the hallway for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:31:09       Use your words better. And the headline, you can't say completely, his face was completely bloodied and he always went way ropes. Bidell things are not true. I don't think you actually watched it. Reading the headline. He probably looked at the maybe photos or someone else's narrative of the fight photos. Even the of the bloody, well, you know, I guess a photo of Connor outside the ring and Willie's live outside the ring for God's sakes. I saved the photo man. Like here's no, no one's face was bloody. There was no bloody period. I mean, it just, it just wasn't bloody like you could see his face. Like I got a photo of the actual stoppage itself, Bro. At the moment the stoppage happened. He was a, I mean, you know, you have like a little bit of two best under his left eye. There was an affair.

Speaker 2:          00:31:51       No blood. Yeah. He had a mouse from the right hand land. Again, up. No blood. Neither guy was. Yeah, the, you don't see the mouse there. You see his right cheek. It's under his, let's just read his eyes were rolling a little bit. Did you hear 100 million illegal streaming downloads? What? 100 million illegal streams. Holy Shit. How much revenue they lose. How about this? How crazy is this Floyd to warm up in the back? Someone from his team goes, Yo Floyd, the systems in California, Florida down. He goes, God, damn, those are huge markets here. I'm going to delay till they figure it out. That's how conscious this mother before this huge fight. That's good. He goes, I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait and it's worth millions and millions of John Saying, how brilliant is he? That was my takeaway with working with showtime and get so close to Floyd and doing all this stuff. He's

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       so God damn brilliant man. Like I had preconceived notions. I am. He's a good boxer. Outbid good of a businessman. How involved is he known and he doesn't let anything go on touch without overseeing everything. Both everything. He's brilliant. He's brilliant as a producer or as a promoter and he's brilliant as a fighter. Brilliant. Then they asked him about, uh, so I was in the fighters meetings and they have all the serious showtime guys there and were miked up and all, all access crew and Floyd's grew and they go, hey, be careful. Cause last time we did this with Floyd, he didn't really know the guys and he kicked him out in front of everyone was super embarrassing. So I'm like, oh that sucks. Some of my suits sitting there and everyone's so serious. I'm like, this is so serious, so stuffy in here. So the guy goes, Jim Gray, Tim gray goes, hey, up Floyd.

Speaker 4:          00:33:27       They're like writing the notes down to send there, like staring down. And they go, uh, you know, you always walk out with like an entourage usually for your fights. There's usually some big celebrity or something like that. Who's it going to be this time? And I know previously you had beef with Justin Bieber, so I was like, well better now than never. I just went out of turn, not the beads, the beads and the FOI laugh Floyd, he's talking dead to that. Jim Gray, his glasses on. He takes the glasses off and goes, damn dog. I'm trying to be positive up in here. We're trying to be positive. And I go, I start laughing. I know all the same. Him walking out with you man, what's wrong with that? He started laughing after that. Everyone was literally like on pins and needles and I was like, come on man.

Speaker 4:          00:34:15       So bebes is all about Church now, Huh? Is that the thing? Like he unfollowed Floyd and Floyd got mad at him. Yeah. And that that guy can unfollow your boy. CanNot follow your boy ever and that guy never unfollow you ever bro. If we do then there's some serious not happening for me. Where there clap back at Justin Bieber to try and be positive. He's just a pop star. Floyd says, well, it's got to a point which is just a pop star who is probably the biggest pop store on the planet. He canceled his tour like he stopped his tour because of this Jesus thing, that pretty sky. I know that guy in the Bible study with a guy. I've been to dinner with that guy. He's an interesting dude. If you're both demon Jesus, he's your guy. Keep talking. Tell me more. I don't, I don't want to be out. I don't wanna I don't want no bad juju on me. I don't want to be the golden snitch for pop stars. I, I don't know what's going on there.

Speaker 4:          00:35:08       There were saying that Justin Bieber already made $93 million this year before he cancelled the tour. How fucking nuts is that? They kid is balling so hard. Even him and then I think, yes, I'm do with Kyrie Irving too. And Kyrie was like, yeah, I want out of Cleveland. Like this motherfucker has some power. He's like, Jesus wants you to play for Boston. You know that, right? Right. So what is he doing to them? Trying to get them to, well look, look, maybe he's doing something. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong way. Right. So if he has a positive influence on them, maybe saying, man, you're, you're,

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       you're so involved in show business and some of them you got to think about living and life taking a moment. Not only that, like, here's the thing man, once you make $93 million, it's basically over. I've changes button, but I'm saying it's over. Just relax. It's over. You put that fucking money in the bank. You don't have to work anymore so I can't work. Yeah. All the work you do from here on out is gravy. This is what you do now. You do what you want to do. Do you want to go out and do a bunch of concerts in front of these people or are you doing too much? Because if you're working, like if you, if you had to go and, uh, do theaters my now you've been doing a lot of stand up. If you had to do theaters Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, every week, flying everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:36:18       Oh, that'd be, we're so tired. You just see, I'd be like, Amanda Bynes you just see my hair is all fucked up. I'd be going crazy. I'd be like Katt Williams. I engineered how I do like this. Latin might thi this is the first tour that I ever named the strange times tour. The first time I ever sold a bunch of tickets in advance, like the smart marketing, but I engineered that like when I'm doing these like fly to places, I'm off for awhile. That's you'll be gone to do that. You have to do with that way and Bieber has the power to kill 100% he just canceled everything. You just canceled everything west of the same thing. What Kanye West did after they checked him into the loony Bin, which he was going crazy. They said he would do that concert, come home. He had all this work yet to do with the DDAS and clothing and they just said he's working nonstop and a small glimpse of, of, you know, show business and stand up and all this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:37:08       It. I mean, I can see how being on a tour that long during go fucking batshit crazy. I can see a little bit like when I saw it. Oh, I Batman. That's crazy. Well, you know what a big factor for me is a big factor for me is when I'm at home, I'm going to sleep for eight hours and I have a schedule. Yes. In terms of like my runs your routine by lifts, you know, whatever workout I'm doing, whatever kind of thing I'm doing, I know where I can train. I know the schools I could train out, I know the gyms I could train up and I know what to do. That keeps me sane. Like having those, like I can work out on the road and it's good. It's definitely better than nothing, but it's not the same. I've liked being able to have this normal, like it keeps my energy up and it keeps my anxiety down.

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       Like all those things get bounced out. When I, when I'm at my normal workout routine, when I go on the road, I'm doing three days in a row. It's hard because I don't want to work out too hard cause I don't want to be tired for two shows. Yeah, I've got two big big ass theater shows, but I can't imagine those guys who do five nights, so they're flying in. So I did two this week, two shows this weekend. So I flew in three days. I took three flights. He said, you know, that's crazy. Crazy. But that's nothing. It's still under those guys that do it five days a week, six days. Well the, well, even still on private jets, it's still exhausting. Exhausted. The same thing. Same thing. I mean you don't have to, it goes more on your schedule I guess if you're flying everywhere for the private jet, but it's still fucking exhaust. Still a beast, man. Yeah. So I get a little, people will go, you

Speaker 4:          00:38:35       poor baby. I know. Poor oh 93 million. I'm like, theory have money. So it's not that they're already set there, it's already gravy. But without back to the Bieber Floyd thing again, I had preconceived notions of Floyd Mayweather before I met him, been around him, sodas, this religious guy, he thinks oh Floyd's just about hoes and cars and stuff like that. That's all that I guess what he's more, there's more layers to that. So for you to judge them based off social media, say Bieber quit falling, quit hanging out with him cause he's just about that. No you don't know shit. You're judging that guy cause he's not going to church every Sunday. You know what I'm saying? Like you're, you're judging him based off Instagram, which isn't fair to do you. I think he's saying like, I dunno what he's saying, but I would imagine if someone tells you to stop following somebody that they're saying there, that person's a bad influence.

Speaker 4:          00:39:21       Right. Which isn't fair to say because Floyd doesn't drink, has crazy work ethic overseas bases, showtime sports. Gee, you know what I'm saying? Like he's healthy. He doesn't it. It's girls Bro. Strip clubs. You don't strip club brought some of the women he hangs out with. I had never seen anything like that. But that's what 15 oh get you. I mean, jaw dropping shit. Hundreds and they just look at me like a bag of shit and he's Gucci shoes. Gucci shoes. Oh, I get it. Not 15 old girl. Hundreds of millions of dollars that all access where they showed that fucking stupid watch. They bought them that Hubo Hubo do. I'd met with the guy from, who will tell me all about it. Watches so gross nuts. It's so stupid looking crystal. One Point two 8 million. No, it was $500,000 I think they made another one for 1.2 they made them three.

Speaker 4:          00:40:16       It's crazy to watch. It's all crystal like the outside of it is all crystal. That's an ad. It's so stupid. Look and it looks like a cheap watch. Yeah, I agree. Not My style. I do love who blow though. Shadow. Yeah. They make great watches it, but that thing, the La Ferrari, isn't that what it's called? Yeah. Yeah. There you go. It looks he rose. Did you see the money belt? Yes. They handed me that thing. This is real. It was kind of small and that I get it smelt like they just killed that alligator on the spot. It smelt like Hummus and allocated. It smelled like shit, but then it's just like gold all over it. I was like, oh my God. In diamonds and shit and rubies. Do you know who made that poop? Floyd Mayweather's team. Did they see a gift to him because they thought for sure he's going to win that like yeah, here's this crazy money fight belt for 1.2 million.

Speaker 4:          00:40:57       We designed ourselves. Here you go Floyd. Wow. Type one point $2 million for that ugly belt. I was all, I was all up on that thing. Well tell me about this then. Are those red? Is the red all, what are those, those gems? Are they, what is the red stuff like in the flags? All the flags. Those are just like colors. Those aren't real. That's not real, but the diamonds and all that and gold, all that through most of is about of all time. Damn. The thing was sweet dope booking. Yeah. It was all fun to like 600 Sapphire's, 160 emeralds, 3000 diamond, sorry, thousand 360 diamonds and weighs three pounds of 24 karat gold. That thing was tiny though. Pounds of gold that's holding. It was like a little belt. It wasn't like the big ass belt. It looks normal sized. Are they all like that?

Speaker 4:          00:41:47       Maybe I'm just fucking Shaquille O'Neal, but if you look at a picture with me, it looks small checks when they're holding it up, click on this link. Small. How weird are the fucking ring car? Girls do boxing. They stand around behind everything and smile from fucking roll the Stepford wives for our, that's all they do is pose. Would that big smile. It's so odd. It's like they don't express any personality. They don't do anything other than stand there and have that same with miles up there and shit. What do you want him to do? Yeah, but they're not like, like looking at each other and talking about like you have this chance smile. They're like those English soldiers, they star and I'll tell you what, corona does it right. It's what they're like. Corona does it right. I'm not mad at any of them. There was no slump busters or all of them were tents.

Speaker 4:          00:42:35       All were stone cold said. All were shaped stone cold. Ted's dad smiling. Yeah. And just not moving like robots and one hand on the hip. I feel like they hit him, hit him. They don't bitch is where the line, they just dropped that belt in their head, dude. How about just yet? That it Dick, how US clunk cop out. I'm uh, doing, uh, before the Wayne's I'm doing a pretty fight show and Floyd Mayweather. Seniors standing to my right gun. You don't know shit. You don't know what the hell are you talking about? Shop? You don't know shit. And I'm like trying to get through it, not pay attention to them that stop playing, Bro. What are you doing? Come on man. What are you doing? I'm selling the fight and clicking. I'm putting money in your son's pocket, man. You need someone up here to talk about it.

Speaker 4:          00:43:18       What are you doing? It just cause I, you know, when you're talking about like Jesus Christ, man, relax. Yeah, he's a smooth talker. That senior. Yeah. Yeah. Real smooth. It's like, yeah. I imagine if you're Floyd and you like literally see your future, if you keep getting hit in the head like right in front of me. Yeah. Heavy stuff. I mean that's gotta be one of the reasons why he's so brilliant defensively. Not just cause he learned from his dad. He learned from Roger Mayweather and all the people in the gym that he trained with, but also he sees the effects of come Shannon punishment and his brother or his uncle rather as well. Yeah. Brought Germaine. Whether there's, you know, he's not doing well, you know, none of them are doing great man. We're doing great. He's perfect though. 40 years old, speak perfect, sharp, knows everything about it and everything and they thought that Javante Davis, oh I didn't see you were doing it.

Speaker 4:          00:44:08       You saw yesterday, he's a kid who they thought was going to be the next paper you king and you can tell athlete and he's just like, he's missing a few things. He goes, because you just can't be 30 and old with 30 knockouts and expect to be a mega star. You have to have everything he's like, so he has to work on so much more. I don't know. And he's 130 pounds. It's tough. His weight, he missed weight, but he took the fine short notice. He missed weight, had a horrible fight short notice, I want to say took it on to cause that I think Sean Porter supposed to fight and then he backed out. So then they booked this dude. He's fun to watch though. He has the most intense tattoo I've ever seen. What is it? It's done. It's for him. He's from like the straight hood of uh, Baltimore.

Speaker 4:          00:44:50       And as he's talking, I looked down at the stir up people's tattoos and it was a apartment building. Brick building on fire in front of apartment building is a mass burglar. Black burglar would like the old school rubber mask on with a bag of money and the gun. Why? Yeah, I was like, shout out to that terrible tattoo. Jesus. He had a bad fight though. And that was kind of his, you know, his platform to do something, but I don't see him being the next like big thing. Yeah. He can tell Floyd too is like, mm hmm. Before he's like, this is the next up and coming guy. He's a nice Floyd Mayweather and now I'm like, he's, he's the next 40 million. He's like, hmm. Not really. No.

Speaker 4:          00:45:28       He had a rough fight too. Yeah, it was a rough fight. He clipped that dude behind the ear or behind the head, but that's just like, we're punches land where people duck is sometimes shit happens and you know, the guy was complaining about it. He went down. I'll tell you what was cool is after the fight, I'm in the back and I see American, Terrence Crawford and uh, Andre Berto. And so I go to talk them and they were all like super complimentary of Conor Mcgregor. Like, dude, he getting box, man. I'm like, ride like, what'd you think? You're just going to go in there, look like an asshole like Bart Simpson and fly. I was like this, like, what'd you expect to happen? Like, we just didn't expect him to get any rounds. We thought it was just gonna be out class. I'm like, Nah man, he looked, he has tremendous belief in himself and he had a weird style that that's strange style of offspeed punches extending his arms fully and then pop them in there and Paul in the backroom, Polly goes, I gotta be honest.

Speaker 4:          00:46:21       I was kind of glad to see that cause when I went and against him like the first four or five rounds, I couldn't land shit cause that style, like it takes forever. Just get used to it. I didn't know what to do. He's like, so I just thought maybe I was having an off day. But once I see that, I see Floyd do this kind of the same thing. You know? Granted Floyd fly to different style. I don't give a shit. Yeah, that style is legit. It's legit. You know? I mean that's just too big a leap. That's all it is. Hope for Connor to go and his first professional fight fight arguably the greatest fighter of all time. It's like he's 100% in the mix now. At d and o get 50 and now it's 100% in the mix that he's the greatest fighter of all time.

Speaker 4:          00:46:59       You think about defensively, no one's even close. No one has been hit as little as him and honor him. Yeah. I used to beat everybody and obviously fought Conor different way than he fired everybody else. That's a fact. But he'd kind of hit it more than any fighter that every huge Kudos to Conor and Floyd, but especially Connor. When's the last time you saw an exciting Floyd Mayweather fight? True Condo went at him. Yeah. That's when we kind of acid the fight. I made them, I turned them into a Mexican. Oh, that's hilarious. Do you say that like, yeah, he didn't know that. No condom. I miss a lot

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       of, Connor brought the fight out of them for the first time since I don't know who you can say, well, let's finish was Victor Ortiz? That was shit. That was kind of a cheap shot. You didn't really didn't bring it to him, but just daughter brought it out of him and this was legit. It was cool, man. And when I watched it the second time, knowing the result, then you really appreciate what Floyd's doing because although Connor did catch him, he definitely caught him with a heart upper cut in the first round that's shut. Yeah. That was interesting because that was like, oh shit. Like you got to realize mind your p's and q's. This guy's legit. But Conor never, even though he clipped him with that shot, it never really heard them except the one shot to the body. Which I was surprised. I got to be honest in my prediction.

Speaker 2:          00:48:07       I thought Connor was gonna do well like you did in the first rounds. I called that. I thought he was gonna run four to five rounds and then I thought he would want, I thought maybe that Upper Cup would wobble them and that would be enough to win Connor kind of the spectacle but just it Kinda, you know Floyd's Chin and you know just the boxing power's a little different man. It definitely is different. And I don't think Conor is loading up either. You know, I don't think Conor is a really like digging in on these shots cause I think he was probably concerned about his endurance. You've got to realize also this fight was relatively short notice. So short notice that I had already booked the DC Improv in advance and it was sold out by the time they announced the fight. Correct. So are not the DCM Prov that the Warner theater in DC.

Speaker 2:          00:48:47       So if you think about that, that's fucking months in advance. Three months they did this fight was announced three months ago. That's nothing. That's nothing for this man. Not to do have a fight. Most of the time a fight like this is six, seven months out. Oh my God. They'd be more, when did they announce Canelo triple down a long time in a while. I think between the time they announced it and then when the fight starts, I got to feel like it's five months at least. At least. Which is norm, I would assume. But, but at least they, but they also, boxing was smart because they set it up. Right. So the at Canelo is a Chavez Jr. That was a joke, but that was literally just a setup to get him to trip to triple g and they both knew it. So you're looking at basically a year in the making and before that, what two years in the making.

Speaker 2:          00:49:29       And here's more importantly during that entire time they're both box. Connor's not, I mean he's not really sure if he's going to actually have this boxing match with Floyd Mayweather it. Right. So he knocks out Eddie Alvarez and then somehow or another, the rumblings get started. But that's just not enough time. Well, did you, did you hear lunch to prepare for Floyd? I agree. Especially in that arena. The best of all time in that different arena. Floyd goes, listen, I tried making this fight before this and the, you'll turned it down and he goes, I will see what happens. And then he goes, then I came back and was like, Yo, this how much money we could make. He goes, and then they were like, all right, let's do it. He goes, but I tried making this fight a while ago. But even before this, yeah, I remember the discussions, but to be the be that close, like when they actually announced it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       Okay, this is actually happening. Crazy. It's crazy to have it so quickly. Especially this man to have a fight. Yeah, it's nuts. So if something like that, if you gave Connor like six months, maybe he could get in better shape where he could survive. He's always going to fit. He's, he's never going to be against a guy like Mayweather. It was so efficient and his movement is so crisp. And this is how I was describing it to a friend of mine. I was like, does your friend have all boxing or martial arts background any fast? He was trying to figure out like why he would get so tired. Gotcha. And I said, I go, okay, when you tie your shoe, you tie your shoe. You don't even think about it. He just called right now. But if you have to think about tying your shoes, it takes more energy so you don't want it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:54       And you have to think. And then you've got your tents. I go Floyd's just tying the shoes. He's reacting. Yeah. He's just so, he's so good. He's been doing it so long that he's just got it ingrained in his movements. Connor has to think way more than Floyd does. And Floyd is constantly pressuring them. So cars backing up all the time, which wears you out. And also the, the volume of punches. He set a really high pace. He thought, I think he thought he was gonna be able to stop them. Well, maybe a little more. Stop him from coming forward. He wasn't prepared when, you know, when Floyd put his head in his chest and did work the raft and allow him to get his rest in the clench. But listen, at the end of the day, I'm all about the glitch in the Matrix, man. I think Connor's is a glitch.

Speaker 2:          00:51:33       It was so much fun that even pulled this off. It's awesome. He didn't dishonor the sport. I thought he did really well. Um, the only, I told colonics and I'm proud of you, man. What he did. We win or lose. This is not, his belief in himself is incredible, but even that is not enough. If you find a better boxer and your body gets tired. So that's what we saw in that fight in the beginning of the fight. If he could have maintained somehow or another, if he was in good enough shape that he could maintain the pace that he had. He had in the first three rounds for the entire 12 you had a fight. It's a well a way different fight because he's dangerous. He's quick, he's moving away. He has a huge endurance problem. And this is like something that comes back to for boxing.

Speaker 2:          00:52:17       Obviously you don't think he has insurance prime in UFC as well. He May. Cause if you look at his [inaudible] Nate Diaz fight the, I went five rounds the first fine. Yeah. But if you look at his attributes, that same durance is, you know, and everyone knows I'm a counter, a Dick Rider. But if you go on, you know his strengths I, I'd say it's at the bottom as far as his strengths. I agree it's not bad. Where it's like, you know, it's not good. It's not good. Look, here's the best endurance in the sport. Mighty mouse for sure. He doesn't count. He's out. True. You're 125 pounds. You're out. Cain Velasquez counts. Cain Velasquez did count cats at the, at the height of his career. You know, who else has phenomenal cardio and Neil Magni, no magnet. You don't mind me? The Gazelle has some phenomenal, phenomenal cardio, uh, amazing pace. Sodas. A, you look at guys, you know Jon Jones has gift card. Very good cardio. Yeah. Might be BPO. We'll figure it out. I was on and we need to talk about that. You can't trust anything. I'll just pointing. Was that how disappointed he was? That broke my heart. John Jones. Dude, you broke my heart, dude. Jamie. Jamie sent it to me. I was at a universal, my wife and my kids, I had no doubt was texting you because what was I doing? Uh, I forget. Oh, I

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       think, oh, I was working in for showtime and I have my phone and then I, I look at, I have 70 miss tax and 23 minutes called like, what the fuck happened? I'm like, someone died who died? And I look, it's like John Jones, like, ah. So when as well with the hi Jamie sent to me. I thought it was a show. Me Too. I thought the people were messing with me. I looked at my phone, I was like, this is, and then you sent to me that you're the first one it takes. I'm like, is this real? You went, yes. Well Ron, my heart, John Snow. Once you start talking, once he started talking back and forth with the golden snitch that go on Snitch, there's zero jokes there. And listen, when the golden snitch comes out with something, they've brand that pisser through a ton of test.

Speaker 4:          00:54:05       It's not like, it's not fake news. His was plastered shit. Apparently a court, well, hold on. I can't, I don't think I can say this because I had an expert. I talked with an expert about this drug and he fucking dropped some knowledge on, okay, this is what I've heard. This may not, may or may not be true because this is the reason why I don't tell you to say this cause I'm, I'm not, I'm not 100% aware. Maybe we can find some information online available. What I had heard is that this drug is not detectable in blood. That it's a drug that's detectable in urine and they have to in a new test, right? The test, they said a new test. What from what I heard too is the Usada is they have a new test, obviously the only announcing, hey we're doing this now.

Speaker 4:          00:54:48       Everyone welcome to the party. And this drug was also, it's, it's very common around power lifters cause you can use in competition and by the time you get tested after it has, uh, hours, a half life. So the shelf life is super short but you take it and makes you super aggro and strong. So it they, and they go, it's so hard to obtain legally. Most everyone gets a black market. And when you get a black market, you don't know where it's coming from. And a lot of time, and this happens with a lot of power lifters in their athletes, when they test hot for this, it's because they got a bad batch or something else mixed into it. Oh, this is gone from my super knowledgeable dude who knows about it. It makes you angry or Oha confident. Passive. And it goes in it. It lasts maybe an hour, maybe two hours Max. And that's how your system, he goes, he goes, so that makes sense by someone would fail directly after cause it no, no, no, no, no, no. He, he failed after the weigh in. That's when he failed.

Speaker 4:          00:55:48       This is after the weigh in? I don't think so. Yeah. He sure. Yeah. Yeah. We'll either way. Yeah. Well maybe it's like lingering. Well that's what he's saying. What he's saying. He's saying, well, but also I heard that they would use the new test to maybe someone gave him a tainted sandwich. Maybe some tainted Dick Pills. Either way. He broke my heart. I'm off. I'm off the train. I'm off the God damn train and I'm sick of the, we have no idea what happened. It was just Dick Pills. I'm like, I'm out. I'm out. How dare you? Well, is he offering up any possible scenario for what happened? No. He tweeted out like, this is when I find out who my real friends are. Hashtag boy

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       fuck that noise. That sounds like you're feeling sorry. She's just ain't helping you out of this one. So much to be grateful for the UFC money, but yeah, that's good. Um, yeah, he's got a nice family. It's true. Good friends. Hopefully whatever. Whatever the fuck is happening. But here's the thing, man. They have a second fire. Joe, listen to it multiple times as much Sada since the golden snitch has been around and he's a motherfucker. I liked the guy. But if you're a fighter, motherfucker, well, hey, he's doing exactly what he supposed to do. Kind of doing, staring with sport baseball first. Now you're hitting all the fighters are ruining it because they know what the fucking parameters. I agree. I agree. I don't look, look, here's the thing about this fight. Do you think Dana's ever like God, what kind of testing was done for this Floyd?

Speaker 2:          00:57:09       Maybe with Conor McGregor fight those new lights. What did he at Brody? I like where you're doing the place, man. You know what man? I like the curtains right when I pulled the new studio, I'm gonna do the curtain. Yeah, you should man. Uh, yeah, but Novitsky is a guy that you don't want on your bad side. Oh No. But do you ever think days like Damn Bro, relax me. But Jesus, they knew what they were getting into and you know what they just decided, this is only one way to clean up the sport. Bring in the guy who was the very best to catching people for doing drugs. Bam, Bam, Bam. Did they do, and here's the thing, Jon Jones, since you sought us, come in, he's failed three out of four tests. The only one he did a full on was a copper OSP. Coke is coke, coke is coke.

Speaker 2:          00:57:52       Coke once. Oh, so that's fine. Oh, coke, you a few lines and just fucking Vandelay Silva pride style. Just, um, how can we can't drink like a giant monster energy drink. That's one of the sponsors APP cause it's not coke because it's like Goddamn turn can, have you ever done coke? No. Haven't have you now? No. It's one of the few I know, but I didn't do heroin but one when I did get my knee operated on, they had me on a drip on a, I guess it was morphine, morphine and I get to hit the button every time you launch this. And I would just, Bram was firing her name. You I celebrate. I guess they let you fire it into a point where you can't die. Oh, that's can't imagine you'd be able to keep hitting that button and then dodge that? No, they can't.

Speaker 2:          00:58:39       I remember, I wonder, I wonder like what the limit is and how many times. It depends who you are, right? Because you probably have a high pain tolerance for with your background, but also I was bored. So if I'm bored and you would give this me this button and let's get [inaudible] watching some terrible local television show, the teaching channel. Oh, I'm sure. We'll see. It's super addicted. I'm sure. Yeah. Someone gave me a bunch of uh, these, these gummies, these weed gummies and I can't rest it and I'm always thinking about something. So I took the weed gummy and Mars attack was on, that shit was happening. I've seen it so many times. It's, I feel like it's always on late at night for me. It's like my go to, it's a great movie. It is like a truly great movie, right?

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       And it's so like silly, like everything all done and the cast is just phenomenal. They want to Redo that. I feel like, didn't Jack Jack Nicholson played two different people in that movie. He played like the high roller, like Vegas Guide and else played the president. Yes. Jim Brown's in that movie. That's right. Jim Brown's fucking everybody up plays like a fucking alien up character. Look at, Tell Your Dad Jack Nicholson is the high roller and then Martin Short's in it to go get the fucking picture of his body in Jesus Christ. Look how cool the alien looks. Thank God. They were awesome man. Look at his clothes. That was when the alien was the girl. Remember he thought he's going to hit, she was all hot. Yeah. And that was peers, peers. Bronson was in it. Yes. He was in it too. Am I crazy? Ad and then remember his him and uh, what's her name? Whatever from sex and the city. I remember her and him get their heads get switched on to dots, right? Yes. Right. They cut their heads off and put them on dogs. What a fucking great movie. Oh Gee. We were at Jack Black. He had the military and he just runs out and gets murked right away from the family on TV.

Speaker 3:          01:00:35       He's all, fuck it. I'm going in. Rushes in. There was so fun. See if you could pull up just a video. We could see them moving around. I feel it. Especially for a 1996. This was some Avatar Shit. All my God. Yeah, man. I did a, uh, a movie or why was it that I did, I did something with, one of the Gat was Christina Applegate and that to, oh, what's her name? Who was that girl? She like it's, and that was the girl from, uh, the big Lebowski. Tara Reid. Wasn't that her? It's not her. Oh, that was that. That was like the yoga bitch who was all into it. And remember shot releases the dose. What's her name? Warren Beatty's wife. Annette Bening. That's who that is. That's that is, that's that is here come the power from all

Speaker 5:          01:01:24       good dude. Look at this. Not Be too rash. Interested in the White House to meet with a really broad boom. It's an, that Benning was with Jack Black. Jack's a shotgun. Cultural misunderstanding about being prepared for a few changes to what? Oh, what a great,

Speaker 3:          01:02:26       the marshy can teach us professor. Quite a lot about her. I forgot about the giant robot. Me To really, grandma figures it out by music kills him. Oh, that's right. Spoiler alert. The crazy ass grandma. We all make mistakes. Mr President. I remember they swallowed a nuclear bomb. They like tried to Newco, man. They landed a balloon then inhaled it. Tim Burton, shout out to Tim. Tim Burns a pirate. No backer. Hell yeah. He's made some awesome movies and they're always so weird too. It's like what a crazy guy. He must be. It must be up bat shit. Crazy. That's right. He did pee wee. Which one did he do? The first one was the greatest man. What time did Batman? He did. He did the early Batman did to write it. First of all, he sold Michael Keaton as Batman. Yeah, that's right. Just about the joker movie that they just announced.

Speaker 3:          01:03:35       He's not going to be in there. Make a Martin Scorsese and Todd Phillips or making a joke or a world stories. That's my boy. I thought Jared Leto. Everybody loved him as a joke or not going to be in this. No, but he has a d. You're talking about two different ones, so Jared loves doing a spin off joker too, but this one my boy taught Feldman put together with Todd Phillips and Martin Scorsese, Scorsese, Saz, Jesus Christ, speech impediment. Anyway, the joker origin story on deck. Todd Phillips got silver. Martin Scorsese and it's dark. It's like a dark joke or like how as a kid he had like a permit smile and everyone made fun of them and it's like on the streets of Brooklyn, it's like super dark, real. I can't wait. Who's playing the joker and I don't think they announced yet. I'm going to make the announcement hair. It's going to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:04:19       Yeah. Right. I can't wait to, I love that stuff. A tricky role. Right? Like Heath Ledger did it, you know that's one of those roles were like, Jack Nicholson did it. Ooh, cheers. Levels killed it too. They sit on set. He would like send the cast like weird shit in the mail. He went full joker. He'd send him like dead rats in the mail. I'm going to have to take, I'm like, Bro, come on now. I get the whole joke or thing that in the mail send me like Gucci Cape. You learn for God's sakes, not the Goddamn snakes keeps sending. He was in a movie that documents his issues with a record company that Jamie, you're always recommending. What's that called again? If Jared veterans in it, it's called the other day, I'll look at Real Brooklyn. It's a, it's something about, um, his band, his band seconds for mark.

Speaker 3:          01:05:03       Yeah. They had some deal or are the record, it's called artifact. Artifact. That's the name of the documentary. So he had some deal with a record company and couldn't get out of it. And it was, apparently they made a brutal documentary about it and it got that, won all these awards and on that flight got to tell you, I've gotta be honest with you. When I see like awards in between those leaves, when they write things in which we, those leaves, I ignore it cause it looks pretentious. Frames. I'll speak it. It must be good. Why do you have what you have to say framed in between fern leaves is this ancient Rome, what the fuck are you doing? Because this was this hieroglyphs it doesn't work at all with me. We're just the opposite. It's like when I see a company that says world's best coffee, I'm like, I gotta try it on that.

Speaker 3:          01:05:46       You shouldn't. You should start framing all your posters that you send out for your Gig. Leaves. Quotes about you. I'll make a quote. You could put it in inside leaves. I'll say he's fucking hilarious. It's like you put it in between two least. What am I funny as friends between two palm leaves. Joe Says he's all right. Get tickets here. Why the fuck is with the palm leaves man? Fishel stupid. Pull that back up again. That shit looks stupid. God, I see that. I'm like, this shit must be good. First of all, why do they have five of them? Get the fuck Outta here. Kenn palm leaves cause that movies. That's why does Jared lentils involved? That's why no, you get 10 palm leaves you took up on it. Make those quotes bigger so I can actually read in my reading glasses. Look at much smaller.

Speaker 3:          01:06:32       The quotes are then the fucking, the subtitle. It's a bunch of independent awards. Gun independent film awards. Audience Award Winner Doc, New York City Festival. Official selection. Oh, it's all bullshit. Toronto International Film Festival. People's Choice Award South by southwest 24 beats per second. Official selection. Oh, you put that, you put that in inside of palm leaves. That's official selection bullshit. One one's getting shit. Melbourne, Melbourne International Film Festival. Official selection. He just want to have your shit and in palm leaves. See that's exactly what I'm saying. That's why they have the quote so small. They're fucking with you shop and he'd just eaten it up. Eat it up. I'm going to go home and watch it. Don't let them get you with those goddamn leave shop. They got me brother every time. Every fucking time. I'm not, I'm not impressed by leaves. No. How about one good quote from somebody that I think I respect their opinion.

Speaker 3:          01:07:26       Legit act or like I enjoyed this move and Martin Lawrence, he always taught the fucking record business was shady. Kevin Hart. Yeah, that'd be great. That'd be great. Yeah. Selection. What does that mean? You didn't win? Did you win or did you not? When you want, you want some cool awards and even win that award. That's an official selection. You get selected bitch. That doesn't mean shit. Can't put that inside of palm leaves. Hugger picked a date with that girl. Did you fuck her? No, no. She selected me to go the selected me. There's something, I just, it just have Brock I brought up because I just thought there's something interesting about Jared Leto suits. You guys think about the SA. He's got a pseudonym that he'd direct Sunder Savile

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       new co Cubans. Cubans I think befallen me. I just say you see it pop up from time to time directed it. It's his name. Oh that's smart. Cause he doesn't want people to think about him. He just wants them to think about the de moving pig an easier name. But can we just call him bart onset? Barneys happens. Maybe it was on like fucking some shit. Dude. He did a, the MTV awards last night before. Like he's all, he's sponsored by Gucci. Soy is like way too much. He has Gucci scarf. Cape the class is all this shit on. Just because they sell it doesn't mean you have to wear it anyways. So they're asking, they're asking him about his appearance and like his performance. He's like, trust me. You've never seen anything like this? I don't want to give it away and how much Jared little fan, I was like, this can be some shit.

Speaker 4:          01:09:03       This motherfucker just did the PR. You mean the Predator? He just did the night vision Predator thing. Look at this. Come on with the home. Would he do, he just did the Predator vision. We did this in the 90s look, that's it. That's the whole video. He was like, it's like some Avatar Shit. You've never seen this before. It's kids. First of all, you're not really obsessed with this, like he's obsessed with himself. So that's part of the problem. And then second of all, you probably know the same drugs he's on, but if you work go full screen with that. I don't feel like you're giving the full faculty. You're talking about the Predator now. It's a little bit more than that. It's a little bit more than that. It's kind of freaking out. Well, that's kind of detailed. Kind of like it. He's got a hat on.

Speaker 4:          01:09:41       You can see it through the hat. It's not that creative though. I feel like interesting that you say this and he's a creative dude. Maybe it's good. Maybe if you're high on ecstasy, this would be the best video ever. Yeah, he might be right. I don't know how much that has to play into it too. Are they good band? Yes. He's, he's phenomenal. I've never literally never heard their music. I like the, you would know they've been around since the late nine. That boy can kind got a lot of kids behind them. Well else people dancing on son. I like the answers dude house. If everywhere you went you had dancers be kind of cool is bear. You don't think that looks good now? The hair has been due to, how bout, how bout this Joe Mtd fucked up so bad and I love him too.

Speaker 4:          01:10:25       How would they fucked up? How about cause Jared Leto toward, with Chester, the guy commit suicide for Lincoln Park and with the guy from uh, Soundgarden. Who else commits suicide? He's known him. Two of his best friends. So they have him do an open monologue for him, right? Yeah. Like just tell him like how great they were and he goes, all right. Uh, let's, let's cut to the last time. Chester performed on stage here and they're like on top of Hollywood and he's singing and MTV cuts the new Mintos. Gav, you had your meant fresh breath today and they cut. They just cut it off and they come back like let's, hey, it's Nikki Minaj his ass. Yeah. They like did this whole dedication to them and then halfway, not even halfway me. 20 seconds to performance. Cut It to commercial. Huh? Is Rough. Why would they do that? I don't know. When they play the full song. I don't know. People are so

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       upset. They thought was so disrespectful. Send an accident. I don't know. I don't think so. I think they're just like, oh, we gotta cut the brake kit. That meant those commercial man. I, you know, look, I'm very biased about this because I don't interrupt podcasts with commercials, but there's a big difference between like watching shit on Netflix and watching shit on regular TV or watching shit on HBO and watching Shit on regular TV. I don't watch commercials. The you get brought out of the of the, like the, the whole hypnotic effect of seeing a show. The breaks your focus a hundred percent if game of Thrones at commercial, there's sometimes the game of Thrones I don't breathe. Like when that red wedding, I was like, oh dude, just after just wait, this is shit happens with certain said Dragon. Try not to get so close to anyone because everyone dies the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          01:12:03       You can't get close. They got close. I cannot get some handling Polisi man. I'm like, Oh Shush, Shush, Shush, shush. We can't talk. You can't talk. I can't say any slave. She's such a, she's the mother of all drag. I know she's not a slighter. She never slay the dragons. That's true. You know what I'm saying though? Yeah. To, yeah. There's like interruptions in the, in the, in the game of Thrones. It's like I'm in the zone, man. I'm in the zone. I tried to watch him walking dead once on regular TV in real time and I was like, I can't even do this. I just flipped through all the chat. As soon as commercial I flipped through, I just record them so I can fast forward through. I don't get how they make money off these ads anymore. Well that's what my point is that this is a very ineffective way to promote things and I think it would probably be a more effective way, like think of all the ads they have in a show, right?

Speaker 2:          01:12:47       If all these shows, wouldn't it be like me? Way more effective if they had one very good or two very good ads at the beginning of the show and they say like game of Thrones is brought to you by boom, they do it. If you've got to do that. I agree. Having in the beginning and know that this show sponsored this entire episode so that the episode doesn't have to have, that's just like they do that business greedy. They do it, but yeah, they want to do those 32nd spots to get all that money for the network. But the thing is like those breaks, they ruined the art so they make the creation worse, so it makes it less valuable. It makes it less valuable to sell ads on. And also no one's watching them. They know it's not going. You're going to get a fraction of the people watching them and a lot of people are going to be upset by them.

Speaker 2:          01:13:33       I agree. And it does. It does. They just don't work that the advertisement agency, you know that come around off, see podcasts and cause if someone's going to listen to your show for three hours a day, you know, it's just a different dynamic. But you're also not up there reading, you know, whatever. Sponsor me on these we have coming to me undies. You're reading in the middle of like, if you're like, hold on Britain, let me do this real quick. A lot of people do do that. I just don't think it's the right way to do it anymore. I just think the only reason why we're doing it that way is because everybody always did it that way before. That's how you saw it on television. That's how you heard it on the radio. They always interrupted for these ads. I don't think that's the most effective way to do ads.

Speaker 2:          01:14:09       I just think that we got used to doing it that I think it upsets people. Definitely does. I think it turns people off where they're like, fuck that product. You know when people used to say, well, what if someone has to get up to take a leak? Well do you don't have to do that anymore? You can pause things now. You can watch HBO on pause it. I mean we have different control over media now and ultimately we're going to get to a point where you can watch things almost everything's going to be on demand the way Netflix does it. That's the future. It's the future. Imagine what donut comedy central special and there's commercials to your special. That's where mine was my last special. I had a break it up and they edited it for commercials and I even like recorded it for commercials.

Speaker 2:          01:14:47       Like I knew that it was going to be 44 minutes. I had to do it during this constraint and these were when we're going to drop things and so it had to make sense when you shut, shut it off and then went to commercial. It's very complicated to edit that way. It's tough enough as it is. Yeah. And it does, it's not good to watch it that way. It's just not me. It's better than not watching it at all. But the best way to watch something is all the way through. But here's the question is say if you're a company, right? Like, uh, outside of podcasts, which are pretty easy, just do the ads in the beginning. How do you, how do you sell things now? Like say if you're, you know, pick a product. If you're mentos Mentos to fucking night, I, uh, I, uh, sponsor that show and I pay enough where they don't need the other ad revenue and I get at the beginning and the end.

Speaker 2:          01:15:34       But is it worth it for them? Because that's a tangible amount of money, right? If, if you're going to have one sponsor for the entire show, think of how many sponsors the video music awards must have. Like, yeah, it doesn't, how many of them don't do this? Performance is brought to you by Pepsi. And then they hit it, you know, which is, which is almost better than doing a full Pepsi commercial gas. I don't know. Still don't want to hear it. Like what? How do you advertise something without interrupting? Something else has got to be a way because it seems so sneaky, but they've always done it this way. You're watching something. You don't want to hear the ad. You've got to sit through the ad. All right. All right. All right. Get back to what I like and then you get back to it, but I wonder if there, they must be seeing a return because otherwise they'd stop.

Speaker 2:          01:16:15       Right. Obviously I bet it's down, but the advertising agency so big then she's so big because who really watches things live now besides sports, like game of Thrones. I mean, I'm in season four for God's sakes. Came out years ago. There's other shows like my other shows, hard knocks HBO, no commercials. I've just, I've, and if there's commercials, I literally just, I won't even see one who's really sitting there when it's live. I watch commercials on Hbo for upcoming programs though. Those aren't really commercials. They're not selling you a product. They're showing you other cool shit there. Developer previews at the movie. Yeah, I take that and here's some cool shit you might want to watch. You're not selling you anything. Exactly. But even at AMC when they, those delicious ice cold sodas pop out, I'm like, you know what? I might have to have one. Yeah, but that's before the movies. He price back that and they also have that after they showed you a bunch of really cool shit with the preview. You've already got my approval or any friends or if you get their real real early, it's a slideshow. All those are fucking

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       a loser. When are you going to start showing me some things that lights are on? Bright white screen and then it's just like ag. Yeah, that's right. It's like a local Italian restaurant. Oh, with the best bread in the fucking things in between. We'll call leaves or their awards are in between leaves. Yeah. It's just you and your buddy. Yeah. I feel like it makes you feel like a loser. Like, oh my God, we're idiots right here so early. You know there's a lot of these movie theaters that are taken off that are in places where you get assigned seating and they sell booze and they bring real food. That's what I do. There's a lot of those now man. This ton of different ones. Yeah, I pick you go there. It's so nice. My so many of them now. You don't have to like, it's good food too.

Speaker 3:          01:17:51       Like really good. Yeah. Some dude was eating a steak next me and shit. Does that synopsis here we go to that one. No arc lights good too. There's some really good ones. Well they figured it out man. It's like the same thing that airports have figured out. Hey, we don't have to have only shitty food. How about you have a nice little restaurant right here in the airport and they started doing that with like Wolfgang puck's at lax and then they have lemonade salary. There's a lot of good stuff at the airport now. Good coffee. You can get real food. San Francisco has like straight up five course meals. Real food. Dia has a chop house. Steak House. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. New York has a JFK, JFK, some serious restaurants. Jason Kilar, Italian food. Really killer. Like really good. Some serious shit. Yeah, there's everywhere. Has figured that now.

Speaker 3:          01:18:41       They're like, look, we, you're, you've got people coming in and out. A lot of these people are business people. Like people have money. Yeah. They don't want to just eat McDonald's. Even the plain foods getting better too. They have an Asta Rhea and lax. Now I know like a fame, like a fancy schmancy little place. We it with a tasting menu. I love that shit. I'm getting hungry. Let me tell you know, he's still sticking to the Kito Diet. Uh, I went pescatarian. Oh, how dare you now just to mix it up. How did keep forever and I'd go back to it. I'm, I'm asking the 10 only fissured, eat scallops and muscles to scalp and muscles. I'm him lobster. My huge lobster fan. How dare I made some lobster. Grilled it up real proper. Like grilled it up. Why don't you just throw it in the dirt and let it get heated up with a son?

Speaker 3:          01:19:28       Grilled. Blockbuster. You don't? What do you like? Your labs are boiled. Boiled like a man. No, that's the JV. See Grill, that thing. I don't kill anything. I just buy it from the store tales. Fucking, Oh, you're grilling blabbing for God's sakes. Don't lobster tails. Jesus Christ. What do you do? What the hell? Fuck. And I'm alive. Oh, fuck up. You get them live from two. It's 2017 fucking. What are you talking about? Grocery stores have tanks. You'd go to a grocery store. Jamie, what's the last time you saw God damn lobster tank. They do. You go to Ralph's or some shit and maybe that the inhumane tank [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       to get out. Do they have it? A lot of places? Yes. Listen, I've seen that since I was a kid. Have when a Gelson's right up the street from here. You go there. Does a tank of water scoop up a fucking laugh, sir. Until you give me that one right there. It's about two pounds, sir. Okay, we'll take that one. Oh, that's a good one. Am I batshit crazy? I haven't seen that in four. And you only go to whole foods. That's why I'm fancy. You don't fuck around your Amazon bought whole foods here about that ratio, change slashing prices and their stock. As soon as they bought it went boom, boom, boom, boom. They paid whatever, 12 billion. Here's what I put up. 22 billion of that. You want to make some money? Yeah, sure. Get rid of this fucking people in the parking lot that harass you when you're walking out with a car, you got ice cream.

Speaker 2:          01:20:50       It's 150 degrees outside and they're like, can I have two minutes for gay rights finger in front of your face? Like, Hey, I hope man, I vote for gay rights. You can't just get me your ambushing me when I'm coming out with my fucking cold food. This guy did that to me. He stuck his finger in my face. They said Gleason's again, g Gelson's Gleason's is a gym and that's right at Gelson's. They did that shit again. Yeah, no fuck that place. He happened to me once where the guy said, can I have two minutes for gay rights or one minute if go down. That only happened to me once, but I've been stopped for a bunch of other things, a bunch of other things. Sometimes they have a whole fucking table set up. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Third Street or Abbot Kinney. There's table set for Syrian children, blacks, Asians.

Speaker 2:          01:21:38       Here's the problem with those things. I don't have the time to research where, where this money's going. I don't trust people that's about for showing. Give the kid money for sure. There was some girl look real aggressive way back in the day. It's like more than 10 years ago at the airports and black chick with a bucket and open bucket and she had some binder with a bunch of photos in it and stuff and she was saying, you know, we're collecting money for this. That sounds legit and quiet. And she goes, and she was like real aggressive about it. I go, yeah, I go, you, you have a binder and you have a bucket that you want me to put money in. And she was like, well fuck you then. And I was like, fuck me that. Oh, okay. I go, that makes a lot of sense.

Speaker 2:          01:22:17       You're super charitable. That's what you're all done. I go, you're stealing people's money with some stupid scam. Like give a, you have a bunch of photos of like downtrodden people that's in some sort of a binder that's buying plastic and you can close this binder and you tuck it cause you're going to get busted and you get this weird bucket that's wide open. You could scoop anything out of it. And then I asked you about it. You say fuck you. Was there any money in there? Oh yeah, there's like a couple bucks in there already. You know, it was one of those weird things. It's like who's to stop you from taking out my rust that like, I was off of, uh, the 90 the other day and I came to stop and I saw this huge banner said, help us pay for our father's funeral.

Speaker 2:          01:22:52       It was like four black guys. And I'm like, God, I came a game, we'll 10 spot, not a 20 minutes. I get crazy. But the problem is you don't know if it really is it mean if this girl really was trying to raise money for a charitable cause, it's really good. She didn't represent it very well. Could. She just seemed like a scammer. Like I got out. I was like, look at that binder. It's just some pictures. They're folded up in a binder and some printed piece of paper. There's just too much stuff going around. Yeah, yeah. Bad stuff. The bucket and an open top. But can you just reach in that bucket? You could drop things in them. Like where's the accountability there? How do I show girl? But that's a good scam. Like if you're a person that wants to scam people, that's like a great scan is a smart move because the car, oh, you're gonna make money, dude.

Speaker 2:          01:23:39       If you go to Vegas or a not Vegas, Lex rather, and you're walking like down that where people are arriving, first of all, they just want you to get the fuck away. They'll throw $5 in there, maybe 110 maybe one at a time. They'll give you money. Why not attend? Gives you money, you'd think seen hundreds of people and the people are gone. They not. It's not like you're doing this in a restaurant where they can see you do it to one purchase coming. Yeah. Everybody's constantly filtering out. I think security is going to let you do that. Well, I think that's why she had the binder and that's why I like the whole bucket thing was very bizarre. It was a while ago, so yeah, long time ago. Security. You might move along later. Yeah, this is more than 10 years ago, but I'll never forget like how aggressive she got with me to the point where my adrenaline fired up when I was like, Whoa, this girl might like swinging at me. That's why he still at worst. Yeah. She was like, she when she said, fuck you, she was like in my face. You can tell like he was enough to know that she is definitely a hit people before and she's not playing. It was, it was a, it was just a person that was a little, just a little too aggressive little teenage kid saw. I'm like, Whoa, am I going to get in a fight here? You get to that, that feeling like am I have to get in a five minute check? Airports, nerves.

Speaker 4:          01:24:46       Dude, I, when I was in the back after the fight, right. So again, I'm with heard about this. Yeah. Tell him about this. Can I just clear it up now? So many people wouldn't blow me up. So again, I'm with judge Crawford, Amir Khan, Berto, and I'm in the back and they're saying how good Connor did. I'm like, yeah, great. You know, I thought it was going to be even better, you know, I'm surprised. You know he did well and showtime one, we go do this, a post fight show thing. So I'm going and I see Nate Diaz and he's by himself. Like no one's really buying and he's by himself and he's on his phone and I see him and I think, Oh, same fraternity, UFC guys. There's no UFC representatives there. Really? There's like Dane. I didn't see him at the fight. I just figured, hey, we're brothers.

Speaker 4:          01:25:26       Yeah, what's up man? But I was going towards him because he looked busy. I was going to go towards him and whether he wanted my help or not, I figured I know a few things about marketing. The next fight for him is Connor. I'm assuming he's there to sell that fight. That should be the next fight. Controversy. Uh, Nate Diaz three the trilogy, that's the fight. So I was gonna go to him because I saw some interviews where it's kinda hating on Connor and I would have spun it the other way. He should have celebrated Connor and what he did winning rounds against the best of all time and saying, look, I, I'd beat him up worse than Floyd. Now we're gonna do this trilogy. I'm going to end them faster than Floyd did. Like, that should be the cell. I was going to talk to him this.

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       So I see him, I'll call him my, I'm like, oh. And they're like, come on Brennan. We gotta go. I'm like, let me just say what's up to this guy and my go Nate brow. How about that fight man, your next biggest fight in UFC history, brother. And he starts laughing. He's like, Oh hell no. How fucking stupid do you look now? And I'm like, I'm my calf ground like Wyatt, he's a cal stupid. Do you look talk in all this shit? I'm like, Whoa, what are you doing right now? What the hell are you doing right now? And he keeps talking and there you go Nate. He doesn't like that stupid. He one rounds against the best box of all time. And the Nate's like he didn't win rounds. He gave him one round. I'm like, all right man, either way. So he gave him, he one rounds though.

Speaker 4:          01:26:43       What are you, what are you doing? And he just keeps talking shit. And he starts like talking about my career and I'm like, what is going on right now? I go, Nate, who's mad at you? I went, Neat. I have no issues with you. You're pointing your gun at the wrong guy. What are you doing right now? You should be selling this fight against Conor, not me. I'm not the guy. I said, I'm in skinny jeans and Gucci boots for God's sake. What are you doing right now? You know what I'm saying? Right. And then like showtime was like, come on, let's go boys. I'm like, Jesus Christ man, keep gone. I was just embarrassed by the situation because he kept talking. He kept doing this and I, this is what, this is the part I left out. This is what triggered him. He was talking, I literally couldn't hear cause people were like, chocolates go cause they didn't want to, you know, a fight.

Speaker 4:          01:27:25       So I shop, let's go. And I, he keeps talking and I'm like, Nate, use your words. I can't understand a word you're saying. Use your words. Oh and he probably has it lists or whatever and they'll probably set them off. But I have, I have no issues with Nathan. So that's when it got ugly. Yeah. Then he kept talking shit and I was like, what are you going to do? What are we doing here? And he kept doing this. I'm like, well what the fuck is happening? I was so embarrassed because the show time guys like, oh my God, who is that guy? I'm like that. That's the guy who's supposed to fight Conor next. They've fought before and like, why does he want, what was wrong with him? What's wrong with him? I'm like, it's just, I was so embarrassed man. I'm like, oh, now I have no issues with them.

Speaker 4:          01:28:03       Do you think the car wants I fight? I do. You think that's a good money fight? I do. I think it's the only fight. I think, you know, I think it's the, the true winner cause at those, those fights at 70 or toss up one and one is whatever. Neither one should be fine at 70 at 55 of trilogy fight makes sense for the belt. It'd be the biggest paper you of all time. I think it's the only five that makes sense. You can't do, could be Tony and Kevin Lee. They're just not big enough stars to get contracts because it could be as it may the way. True. And he's, he's not ready to fight. He's just, you know, he's never done that. So how can you sell? Could be right now, like so let's say just in a perfect world you want to do could be versus Connor and you go on this world tour trying to build Khabib up. You've got to rush. You go over. Connor wants to fight him in Russia. Crazy. How do we know he's going to make weight and doesn't pull out? So it's out of the equation right now. He needs to come back, fight someone else. So to me, be easy to get his body sorted out and he's a finger assumption. Rockhold was saying that his liver shut down and I read in an interview, apologize. I didn't hear him say or read in an interview.

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       He said that his liver shutdown, uh, when he was cutting weight for the Michael Johnson fight. And then the next fight after that, he didn't make weight. His body shut down for the Ferguson fight and they cancel the fight. I'll tell you what though, I might to be flying in the conversation for me and went till he gets his shit together. I'm not even entertaining the idea of him fighting and it looks thick. I like Kevin League. He's bad motherfucker package. He's a bad author. But the thing is, he speaks well. He looks the part talks a lot of shit, but he's great. He dresses well. He has all the makings of your next superstar. Yeah. And he realizes now, especially in the Conor Mcgregor era, you've got to talk a lot of shit. Yeah. Floyd set of paths. Like you just can't win fights. You've got to sell yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:29:40       Listen, Kevin Lee is only, I think 25. He's young. 25 or 24. Yeah, find out he's 24, 25. Um, super young right now. Remember how brash Connor was when he first got to the UFC? Very similar. He's like 26, I believe. Okay. So He's 24. September 4th. He's almost 25. He'll be 25 in a couple of days. He's super talented. Looks better every time you see him. So he's essentially like somewhere around Conner's age. When Connor, he's like a year younger than of first burst on the scene. And Connor was nobody back then. Nobody knew who he was. We'd do. I had seen him on the Internet, uh, and from fights in England and I knew it was really talented. I actually went back and forth with them. What's between us, you have to say. So there's a few people who knew about him, but it was nothing like what you see now.

Speaker 2:          01:30:31       Nothing. Right? Kevin Lee down the road is at 155 pounder who talks a lot of shit. He's a bad motherfucker. Straight. He looks great. Speaks well, built like a brick. Shithouse speaks well speaks well. African American dress as well. Check, check, check, check, check. All the boxes checked and he can fucking fight. So what's the biggest thing that fight with Conor McGregor down the road? Ooh, you're gonna need, you need more time by here. You right down the road. This is my thing for Connor like, but he could do it. He go 100%. I'll tell him to me. Kevin leads your next big thing. However, Tevin leavers, uh, Tony Ferguson's a Taj site, so god good. Oh great fight until he was another one. Tony Ferguson down the road. 20 Ferguson can talk some shit to Tony Ferguson is very smooth. Tony Ferguson is very confident and she also a Weirdo. He's wearing his that weird vibe.

Speaker 2:          01:31:20       You get that weird vibe is so intense but like, yeah, I was like no classes, wing Chung and shit. He does all these weird moves where he's like get flowing on the ground rolling around. He does a lot of weird shit but his endurance is off the charts. He cuts a shit load of weight and does it like a professional again to set can capitalize on that and he wins by knockout. He also Wednesday side mission, very get the guys. He's beat two tough death for Kevin. It's a very tough test. Both have very good to me as far as like potential like superstardom. Those are the guys. Kevin Lee is that, that's the guy right now I think. Yeah, maybe. But if Tony Ferguson becomes the interim champion, it starts talking all kinds of crazy shit. His

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       star will rise, man, don't get me wrong. Does it demonstrate in rising and then be coming like a straight up superstar like a transcendent like Conor McGregor. Ronda Rousey's like there's a certain, there's a certain thing Canelo because he's not really charismatic and he only speaks Spanish. So with the Mexicans it collects just Mexicans. He twice and also like a trip, Mexico has sort of a built in boxing base through the king of boxing. You're in, you're Mexican, you're already basically, here you go, you're selling. No, you're good. Barely. Barely talks. He's not, he's not entertaining at all. The entertaining fighter maybe or Mexicans. He's all right. Fuck you saying no, he's from the same hometown is my girl. She's like, no, he's not to interview them. It's whatever. But Gunner Gennady Golovkin who's equally impressive, if not more impressive than Canelo. He's undefeated. He Merck's everybody, everybody. He's a goddamn murderous body puncher and you know, he can sound like like 150 papers, 150 200 Max.

Speaker 4:          01:32:53       He doesn't have the star quality and 50,000 page views for one of the very best boxers on the planet are, if not the best undefeated. How about 175,000 for Andre Ward? Crazy. 125 for the rematch. Crazy man. That's even crazy. It's nuts. I don't even think it was 170 I think we looked at it. I think we run 60 sets a real bomb on 67 and like one 25 or split again to become like a straight up household superstar. It takes more than just being this bad ass fighter and Anja looks after that. Everything Andre Ward is like, he's articulate, he's admirable. He seems like he's got a great control of his ego. He's smart. He's a great hitter. Comes from a rough background. That's a great stories, but at the same trainer since he was 12 yeah, he's never lost Olympic gold medalist. I wonder why he lost, there's something that he lost that cove left.

Speaker 4:          01:33:38       Yeah, right. He loves something about him that people just don't, I don't know what it is. I thought he lost to Kavala fight, but I thought it was close, but the second fight he fuck Koval I've up. That's what's important because that was a big, a big turnaround. How about Deontay wilder? Yeah. He's our American born heavyweight champion. He had come in right now with two pizzas and we'd be like, what's up bro? They know what stopped him out. No one knows who he is. Crazy. It is crazy. And he's supposed to fight or tease. I think that's the, the room is dangerous. I don't like that fight for him to our teas is a bad motherfucker. And then on, uh, at the Joshua was supposed to fight that a Russian fellow. Um, and then I think the winner of those two fight, I forget his name.

Speaker 4:          01:34:19       It's a tough fight for, uh, Joshua, we should win it, but a fricking wilder has a tough fight on and since, yeah, it's super tough. Fight that Ortiz's he's very good. He's a southpaw south Paul King, they call him King Kong. Yeah, he's a beast and I don't like that platform, but neither one of those, like Joshua was a big star looks, the part speaks well knockout artists at that great fight with Klitschko. So he kind of has that. But those other guys, there's just nothing in Joshua will be that way. It will be giant for the UK, especially if he defends the show a few times. Huge giant, giant, bigger and bigger with every fight he'll, he's got superstar status. He's great. He's super articulate, very reserved

Speaker 3:          01:34:57       in the UFC with Jon Jones out. He's really your only next superstar and he's a notch down from Connor. Like there's Connor Brock Lesnar Rhonda. They're here. Commons even above them. And then there's your second tissue start and he got Jon Jones. Jon Jones, it goes, becomes the number one fuck up of all time for sure. Hands down if he wasn't already. This is the biggest one that's consistent at beating the shit out of people, not to gone. Very consistent and consistent at fucking up. Now we can only hope and pray that somehow or another there's some mistake. How many times are we going to go over this? Yeah, you around saying like, dude, you're breaking our heart man. He's so God damn good. You watch that fight with Daniel Carme and you're like, Jesus Christ. He's so good. He's so good. But do we take the PDS and the account now?

Speaker 3:          01:35:44       Like, how do we know what real John Joe are we getting? Because the one we saw with the Osp one and it looked like shit and then as DC the best of all time now cause he's beat everybody including heavyweights, but lots of Jon Jones. But wait, Jon Jones was taken PDDs it's just a hot mess. It has a hot mass. Meanwhile owes the mayor's like fucking bring it. Opposed Amir's market. Those donors like fucking bring it with. That guy's got bricks for hands too. But let me tell you something, man. When I shook his hand after the fight, I was like, oh, okay. You know how some dudes you just shake their hand. You're like, oh I get it. He's got giant hands, dude bricks. They feel like bricks. I think you do that did puts hands on people. He fucks people up. See, I think you do.

Speaker 3:          01:36:23       Let's say John's out, right? Long story for years. Suspension out. I broke my heart. See it. Go to Japan just to the Gills and fuck all the whores you want. Do whatever you want. Oh right. I'm out. I'm over it. I'm mad at them. So then you have [inaudible] de Mer verse Guston to fight DC a hundred percent it's great. Fine, right? Very Fun. Fight. Fight Gustafson is so veteran. He's so good. It's guests. It's Gustafson.

There's just no, there's nothing great stuff out there and Cyborg is not bad, but her husband's name is cyborg too, so it's like you can't double Cyborg gotta do some Cyborg or the guy that you went with a sideboard and Silverado brew in Brazil. Sideboards and silvers or like Joe's and bills here. You know what I'm saying? There's a bunch of Cyborgs, right? There's other cyborgs. I'm trying to think of other ones. There's one other guy that I know that call themselves Cyborg. It was a Jujitsu Guy, I think. Does anyone ever call you Joey? Never. Nah. Really know, but also I'm friends with Diaz and everybody calls him Joey until he's been Joey, but his name is Jose.

Speaker 3:          01:40:03       Really? Yeah. Joey's Diaz. His name is Jose Diaz. Oh, well yeah, but we've always called him Joey. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. You would call, well Jose Joe. He could. Yeah, you can for sure, but I think growing up everybody called him Joe. Do you have a nickname as a kid? No. No nickname. No, just straight up Joe. Yeah. I never really had a nickname. Nothing too. When I used to play pool pool halls or the place where everybody gets a nickname, there's, there's so many crazy nicknames people. A lot of times the nickname was like where you come from? Like white plains Charlie or Mount Vernon. Tommy. There was a lot of that. My nickname was Joe, the comedian. Real creative guys. It's so lame. I was Joe the comedian, but you're the funny guy in the pool. While they knew I was a professional comedian that would come and play pool those like ray the fireman? No, no, no. I was like 20. When I first started playing pool. It's right after I tore my

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       ACL, so I think I was 23. So like, Hey, it's Bob the ups driver. Yes. Real original theory. The fireman, goddammit. Yeah, white plains. Charlie was a big one. This is like crazy little semi homeless guys to come and play pool all the time. He was addicted gambler. So many guys I realized about gambling addicts when I played pool. I just did not know how many of them there were because I'd never been around them. I'd never been see like until I started playing pool, I didn't go places like, uh, like a night club type environment or like a, a place where a bunch of like CD people would hang out with, you know, pool halls or CD, like a lot of gambling and shit talking and people betting on things. I didn't grow up around that. My high school years was all taekwondo and then after that, yeah, it was all martial arts camp competition and then all of a sudden I'm around these complete degenerates, like I'd never been around them and I'm 23 which is good life lesson though.

Speaker 2:          01:41:54       It was interesting. I was a lot, there was a lot of people that are addicted to drugs. There was a lot of methadone people that would come during the day and they would just be like half out of it and they would play pool and they were terrible. No one just hustling for their money. The White House, when they would just play pool with each other, they would, but they would call him the Methadone eons and they would come in and play pool and you just bang balls were like, they couldn't concentrate Baldwin for real. They could not concentrate, you know shit. But it's funny because it's like what it was like was it were like a bunch of people that were under a spell. It would come in, they'd be just fine and they would play pool, but they were dull. They were like gray. People just pass. They're never, there was no vibrant color.

Speaker 2:          01:42:29       Correct. It goes on, but the crazy thing is though, there was a guy who was the best player I ever saw, one of the best players I ever saw, and he was a heroin addict and he would do heroin and he would do, he would go into the bathroom, he would shoot up and he would come out and he would sit down on up one of those bar stools. One was pool stools, you know that kind of elevated with a thing for your drink. He would sit there on this like this for a fucking half an hour and everybody knew what was going on here, that he had to do this. He just sit there like this, just highest shit so fucked up. And I never been around anybody who was on heroin either. I've only seen everybody intervention. They had explained it to me. My friend Johnny, who did a bunch of drugs would explain to me and he's like, just going back to do his shit.

Speaker 2:          01:43:13       I go, [inaudible] Shit does he do? He's going, he's going to fucking shoot up, couldn't go shoot up and he's going to come out and he's going to sit down for awhile and then you have shoots for while I was going to play cause they've just, that ass dude he would get up and he had no feet. He'd be like the guy who was playing this Guy George, the Greek George. Yeah George the Greek was a one of the local big time guys and he was a a wealthy guy. He was always gambling. He gamble high, you know he would say like crazy shit like it got the height of a mustard seed. You Cock sucker and raspy guy always smoking cigarettes. You could smoke cigarettes indoor back then everybody smart tire place filled with smoke and he was gambling against this guy and he had like some crazy because this guy was like literally a world class pool player and his fucking guy didn't miss a ball and he's like he shoots the fucking nerves off.

Speaker 2:          01:43:59       He goes into that bathroom and he shoots that shit and he shoots his fucking nerves. Off, he comes out of your cam is a ball. The realize man, he would just, he was so dead behind the eyes. Like you'd look at his eyes and they were black, like a durables, like a strike to short young sharks. He was just gone to or both eyes are black is for lack as foe. Dude. That's what he was lying. I'm telling you, it was the weirdest thing around him. Like he would look right through you. He didn't see you. He was just blinked. Grieved on heroin. He couldn't miss. Couldn't miss maybe want to do heroin. He's probably dead now though. Oh, he's dead. I know he's dead. Oh, 100%. I ran into him at a pool tournament when I first moved to La in 1994 and this guy tried to get me to drive him to Compton so he could cop.

Speaker 2:          01:44:39       He asked me to put him, he asked me to put him in the pool tournament. There's a pool tournament. Um, ad um, uh, God dammit. What's it called? Hard Times. Hard Times. Bill Years in Bellflower. It's one of the biggest pool halls in the world. Hard Times. It's like a world famous pool hall and it's in Bellflower, California. And a lot of big time gamblers and top level players used to play there all the time. And even came out of there like Keith McCready. It was like the guy from the color of money, he was the nemesis of Tom Cruise. Legitimately one of the best pool players in the world at the time. Came out of there. So this is a huge pool hall, like one of the biggest like pro level pool halls in the world. And I get there and I see this guy, they call them buffalo bill or water dog.

Speaker 2:          01:45:21       Those are his two nicknames. Squatter Doug, depending upon which part of the country and what time of the year. What are dogs? Cool. So I ran into him and a I, Mike, are you playing? What are you doing out here? And he was like, yeah, I just need to get somebody to put me in the tournament. I'll, so I'll put you in the tournament. Like it was like, I don't know, 20 bucks or something like that. He didn't even have 20 bucks. Need you to front of $20 post to get them in a tournament or whatever. I don't remember how much it costs. Might've been 50 bucks, whatever it was. I was like, I'll put you in hit or legit chance to win. Like he was a world class player. He's like, okay, better got to go to, got to go to Compton so I can cop.

Speaker 2:          01:45:51       And I was like, what? And he was like, you've got to drive me to calm down. I'm like, I'm not driving you to Compton so you could buy heroin because if they arrest you, they take your car. Like if I was here with the transaction, right. Oh they confiscate your car. Oh, I was like, you got to, I had a 1994 Toyota super bitch bitch. You crazy. Super Turbo. The cow with a big crazy stupid purple silver. I love the purple one. I was wanting to space it pro. My cars are almost all sower. I hear you. Damn, that's sick drive. That thing that Compton and he looked the ways we do to that, the first nice car ever had ever, you know, I was like uh, at the time, probably 27 ball in for the first time I live hell. And I'm like what should a Postmates that shit. I was like, I have a condo. I rent a condo right now. Motherfuckers not given all this up. I was like so excited. He's all sad. Oh yeah, super sad. Super Sad. Super is that, and he went out there and he lost two matches in a row, like barely paid attention. I put him in the tournament anyway, asked me to put them in any way

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       like, but $90 drugs man without heroin he could not play well. He was so itchy I think. I think those guys they'd get off of that stuff. A cold Turkey. Like if you have a your Jones and Ford, will you put them in a tournament with withdrawals? Fucked up. I don't know if it was even withdrawals, he'd probably gotten a lot earlier that day. He was just Jones. I don't think it was a full withdrawal one cause he seemed pretty, you know, I think when they get withdrawn, Olin does that a word. Withdrawal. Withdrawal. They start sweating and shit and the shape. It's like they have the seeker, like they have the flu. I tried going off coffee for a day and I got withdrawals. I get headaches. I was like sweating, clammy skin. I'm 100% addicted to caffeine. Me 200% I'm not mad at it though.

Speaker 3:          01:47:31       I love caffeine. I like life with caffeine. I like coffee. I like the ritual. I get up in the morning, I drink some coffee, I'll do a little reading. I do a little writing sometimes to take a giant shit. Then I worked in standard routine. Used to work out right away, but I found out that it's better if I let my brain warm up a little bit. Just get him a little foggy. Yeah, we got them on file. You have my coffee, take my kid for a walk and then I hit the gym. Sometimes I like to look at the news too, just to make sure the world's not fucking falling apart before I start my day. Yeah, I might. Yeah. It's just like to be in the know, you know I go to Google, I have this like Google news things set up on my phone so I'll hit that without looking at social media and said I don't get looking at my own stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:48:11       I just go and read stuff about like what's happened in the world. Everything. Okay, we're going to war with Korea. We're good Santa Right. Like to check off your shit happening. Some fire I need to know about to light fire season right now buddy. Dude, it's, it's rare. 180 degrees outside right now. It is fucking toast. I'm sweating in here. It's the same. I feel bad for my car dude. It's insane. It's so bad for my car. It's so hot. How hot it is outside. When I came to the door to unlock, to get in the air conditioning from our studio was billowing out and I could feel it on my hand. Why the fuck outside? It's crazy cause it's really the world's ending bro World. Satan's coming Houston is, we're living in Arizona now. It's so fucking hot. Is this like, is it going to keep getting worse?

Speaker 3:          01:48:53       Like at what point does it become uninhabitable de la yesterday, my, uh, like girls, dad was at the house and he just goes, Brennan, it's only gonna get worse. I'm like, God, I just, the heat, just the world. Everything. Is that true? That I disagree. It's better than ever. I disagree. There were like, I know things look rough right now, but if you, if you look for bad things, you're going to find bad things. Here's what I think is going to be to say, Jamie, whenever you see like a high temperature like today and we don't beat the record high, whatever that was, right? I always think about what the fuck was going on in 1927 when it was 172 bushes like fucking pussy and dude's just like shit. And more. If we get to wear three piece suits and hats, like an ass holes, imagine what George washing my days. They had those fucking wigs. Oh yeah. Powdered wigs. Yes. That would go into the courtroom

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       with a powdered wig on with no air conditioning. No AC. That stupid wig and the full get up. What is a powdered wig like? What does that mean? Do they put powder on the wig? What is a powder powder and white? Yeah. Why did they have powdered wigs like Google that? That's a crazy, like a crazy tradition. Who was, I gather. It looks tight, Bro. It's what are you wearing bro? In England? No. Do they wear them? They wear, I'm super obvious where like you can see their hair underneath. They put a little effort. The powder made, made, made them white or whatever color. Okay. In 18th century, men's wigs were powdered to give them their distinctive white or off white color. Women in the 18th century did not wear wigs but war. How'd he say that word? Co Fewer Co fure supplemented by artificial hair or hair from, oh, they had a week after 1790 English women seldom powdered their hair.

Speaker 2:          01:50:40       Why did people wear powdered wig? Click on that mental floss. You know, why the fuck would they do it and why did they, what does that Peru keys, powdered wigs called Peru keys were all the rage. Look at that fucking wig. They would wear the goofy, his wigs. They would like, uh, like 1970s rockers. How weird. Centuries powdered wigs called Peru keys were all the rage. The chic is that say how you say that chick is chic, right? Hairpiece cause I always hear chic, I don't really read it that often. She care piece would never ever become popular. However, if it hadn't been for a venereal disease, a pair of self conscious kings and poor hair hygiene. Wow. The [inaudible] story begins like many others with syphilis standard 1580, the STD had become the worst epidemic to strike Europe since the black death. Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          01:51:29       These people were all fucking each other to death according to William. William, how do you say that name? Close clouds. Uh, an infinite multitude of syphilis. Patients Clog London's hospitals and more filtered in each day without antibiotics. Victims faced the full brunt of the disease, open sores, nasty rashes, blindness, dementia, and patchy hair loss. Baldness swept the land. Whoa. He was still rocking these things at the time. Hair loss was a one way ticket to public embarrassment. Long hair was a trendy status symbol and a ball dome could stain any reputation because they knew you had syphilis. All my God. When Samuel Pepys brother acquired syphilis, the diarist, what does that word diarist he writes the areas for a living that said he does. Or is it generally in the dairy business? The first one. Well, we'll Google it after we read this. Okay. The diarist rope. If my brother lives, he will not be able to show his head, which will be a very great shame to me.

Speaker 2:          01:52:31       Wow. So this year was that big of a deal because we were bald. You were made fun of what they do back then. Well, yeah, that's true in the Bible. You know, God sent, sent some bears to kill some kids because they made fun of this dude for being bald. Those part of the dark shit. Hmm. So, uh, Louis the 14th hired 48 wig makers to save his image five years later. So this was Louis. The 14th was only 17 when his mop staff. Odd. Terrible genetic. Yeah. Not Good. Um, Louis Louise, cousin Charles. The second did the same thing when his hair started going to gray. Both men likely had syphilis. Courtiers courtiers hmm. I don't know what that word is. And other aristocrats immediately copied the two kings. Ah, interesting. They split it. Wigs in the style trickled down to the upper middleclass. Europe's newest fad was born.

Speaker 2:          01:53:28       The cost of wigs increased and perks became a scheme for flaunting wealth and everyday wig cost about 25 shillings a week pay. Wow. For Common Londoner. So a couple grant for this fucking wig. The bill for large elaborate Perutz ballooned to as high as 800 shillings. Whoa. The word big wig was coined to describe snobs who could afford big puffy Peru. Still use that. Wow. Poofy wig. That's crazy. When that was from the 17 hundreds when Lewis and Charles died, wig stayed around like some story. This is crazy. Proofs remained popular because they were so practical. They're so practical. That's why I say about wigs are so practical. He said, this is just the thing to do at the time. Head lice. Oh Wow. Headlights were everywhere and nitpicking was painful and time consuming wigs. However, curb the problem, lice stopped infesting people's hair, which had to be shaved for the proof to fit, so everybody's shaved their head and wore a wig.

Speaker 2:          01:54:36       I said, no home. They camped out on the wigs instead. Delousing a wig was much easier than delousing ahead of hair. You send the dirty here piece to a wig maker who had boiled the wig and remove the knit. That's where nitpicking came from. The term nitpicking came from picking the lies out of wigs, dropping some. Damn. This is just like when Callon does that segment of your show dropping knowledge. The first of all, you've got to rename that. You didn't make it. You got to rename that immediately. You cannot say dropping knowledge. We just can't. No. We should call it to call him up. We should call him up right now. Hey Brian. Hey Brian. We've been talking. We've been just no more drop. When it's wonderful that you're sharing these little tidbits of information, but to announce that they're going to be there in a segment and say we're going to drop knowledge now you know why your mats pops up out of the ground, like a fucking check in the box or you just regurgitate what hunter said. He's like, what's up? And I had to get drop knowledge. Do I have to do it? So listeners when if they don't like that to fast forward otherwise to just spring it on you. So it's Kinda like, you know, it's almost like an ad read. So if you dig it, cool. Here it comes. This is his or your,

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       cause I was getting to have the drop good drop knowledge on it was mine because he told them to start it off as a segment. No, no. I told them some of them are really funny writer or interesting or fun. Yeah, sometimes. Is it, is it a problem that you used to do it in every episode? Is that what it is? Yeah. So we'd be like in the middle of talking about wigs in by, you know, in France in 1940 and then it would go off on this thing and kind of derail the show. So I said that's interesting though. Like if he told you that, if he told you that, you'd be like, wow, that'd be great. No sprinkles in some stuff where people like that's not true, man. So true stuff. Oh, where's it, what's the not true stuff? You know, it just depends on that.

Speaker 4:          01:56:20       So interesting. Yeah, it just depends. So I figured, might as well just label it so fans know what's happening right now. I'm not a fan of segments in anything. Whenever he goes. Okay, now we're going to go to the, let's pretend you're a Mexican game fan. Well, not a fan of like a thing that people like do in the middle of a show. Well, I mean, well it's for ours. You know, we'll have our banter back and forth like we have, not for three hours because we don't do it every day, but we'll do it. You know, if he had the same person every single day, it's tough. Killed the three hours material. You and I could do a podcast every day for three hours, different animal Joe. That's a Dev. You're talking about you and just talk some shit, some professional podcasts or say I'm good at talking shit.

Speaker 4:          01:57:02       It's what we do. But are you saying cal is not, how dare you? That's what he's saying. What he's saying. I'm not saying that we're into the same things. You and I are under the same thing. It's couns into you know, but I'm in the same things. A lot of the same things that into I'm going down a weird road. You know what? Listen Bro, listen, tell the fascinating man. But what would the current events it gives us, Fred, you know I started current events calendar and keep up with current events like he wouldn't know. Um, whatever today's current event was like with pop culture. Like he has no idea with what's going on in the world because he's so into history. That's where Jamie comes. Exactly. Especially if it's like black Twitter. Yes, he is just on the ball. So I'm kinda like, yeah, so exact.

Speaker 4:          01:57:46       So the idea is like Jamie introduced you in a certain stuff like with sports, like counter CNN sends out, you know, whatever the fuck he does. So I'll be like, man, you didn't know. You know, people flashes Dick. He's like, I have no idea. Well he's into books and stuff, which is admirable, but that's why the show works is he's into his thing. I'm into my thing and cross pollinate, cross pollinate because Paul is he, how much is Brian into like MMA these days? Uh, I don't know, like the, and that's the, that's the one of the reasons why I started my own show because I'd be like, Hey, did you watch that fight we are covering? He'd be like, no, I didn't see it. Or you just see the highlights. And I'm like, dude, I'm getting balls deep into this. We kind of have to, if you're a fighter and the kid and you grow like this giant MMA population of like listeners. Yeah. But you know, for a reason, maybe he's busy or somebody who just see the fights. It's tough when, and that's how my show started. I'd be breaking down a fight, can pretty intricate into it and he'd go, so you know, just some beginners where I

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       couldn't really get into it. You don't get, they left. These motherfuckers know this Saturday is January 2nd, this Saturday, January there is a January. I did this because I'm thinking of who's fine. I'm sorry. I'm throwing triple tasking, podcasting thinking and going through a taxi. Um, no. Um, the Saturday, the second is UFC fight night. It's definitely true. Versus who is it to pull it up to have a mother fucking fight companion. That's the point, ladies and gentlemen. But um, we are not going to do a companion for Edmonton because I uh, that's why do they still have Jermaine Germane to me on there? She slide. The fight did shout she got injured. She about, yes. It's pulled out unspecified reasons by the, it's speculated that it's an injury. Speculate. It has to scale. Scale. Well Hashtag maybe cyborgs going to be attending. Yeah. Okay. Yes. From placement, late replacement for injured, Germane to randomly, uh, Talita. The Olivera has apparently agreed to step in on short notice. Who is she? Have you seen her fight before? I'll, let me see the rest of the cards. Yeah, let's go back to the card. All right, here we go. What's the full card here? Volkov uh, yeah. Yeah, he was very good too, man. He beat his last fight. He beat Roy Nelson to kind of a light card.

Speaker 3:          02:00:04       I'm just being honest. Feel like light would be an understatement. Yeah, I agree. Like Ooh, but wait a minute. Bev [inaudible] him off his fighting and then you also got, uh, uh, Calabar yeah. Um, click on that tie ties him off fight. He has, he's been out of the UFC for a while. He's in the UFC fight pass prelims. They go right there. Bam. Yeah. Philippe's Silva. I'm mayor back ties him off. Is a very good fighter. She's very good. That's, that's going to be an interesting fight. I don't know too much about Philippe Silva, but uh, this is Rotterdam, right? This is where this is taking place. That made a to be fun. It's Callen town I think so we got to get Eddie Bravo drunk and bring up the conspiracies.

Speaker 3:          02:00:51       That never happens. Um, all Bob Arena is fighting. That's who's he fighting right next to that one. That's borrower does not. Was that uh, uh, Brian Barberino Liana Edwards. Jamaica. Bam, Bam. Um, yeah. You know, it's like God, but I will watch it and I'll see what we do. It's tough motherfucker. I like watching him fight. Yeah, that should be interesting. Yeah, that'd be fun. Either way. A lot of these new spiking a fight pass. Did you see your boy snoop Dogg Tuck Shit to Conor McGregor? No. So did he do, what did he do? Oh my God. Can you bring that up Jamie? How did his, how the UFC doesn't go get the fuck off to his face. No, he put blast sound. The Instagram real fuck you. It, that's what happens. A little bitch all like just oh know snoop Dogg trashes Conor McGregor and profane tirade.

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       Really? Kayla's here. This 1 million views by the way. Ooh. Powerful.

Speaker 5:          02:01:48       No mother fucking punk ass bitch motherfucking shit. Nigga. Nigga. That's what you get coming to a motherfucking gang fight with a butter knife. Your bitch ass mother fucker. Fuck you Nigga. Shit Nigga. What a party. Yay. Hi honey. I got one. I got one more report. 50 no Nigga named macgregor bad motherfucker. He got hard. He got horn. Oh fuck.

Speaker 2:          02:02:31       Well okay. What happened there? Did you get schizophrenia? Xe bipolar is a bad Malia. One more rev left. Wow. Come on man. I just don't get when people celebrate like inside me. The demise risky took. It was a fun fight. It was a fun fight. The war brought the fight to Floyd and it made it a fight is the biggest fight of all. Before we brought the fight to Connor. I mean Floyd step forward with his hands up and move towards him and constantly created pressure. Kiandra also came forward to man like they both brought it. It was a very good fight. It was very entertaining, very entertaining. He hit Floyd more than any fighter hit him and I think the right result took place. A specialist, the greatest specialist of all time, beat a guy who is just not at his league when it comes to that specialty, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:03:19       I mean, I think that's what we should have seen and I think it was good for everybody. I think it was great for Floyd because there's the most entertaining Floyd fight ever, right? It was a a great opportunity for him to showcase his ability and to show everybody what he can do. I can get the 50th Win, get the 50th win, and for Connor, he got to show people that he can hang for till he gets tired. He can hang pretty well with the best fighter of all time. This is what else I think is cool is Connor's going to take those boxing skills and now bring it to the UFC. Oh, and he's been on, there's, there's no fight UFC can throw to them that's going to be bigger. There's just nothing. You're not going to rattle him. The moment can't get big enough for him.

Speaker 2:          02:04:03       So now, unless they give him Jon Jones, Brock Lizard, like a tag team, some weird random shit, which would be awesome. However, there's nothing they can do. Right. So now he's learned from this. He's, and he's a guy who learns from his losses and brings that to the UFC. I think he maybe has one, maybe two left. But still you think so? Yeah. I don't see him too. I mean when you have 100 million in the bank, he even said, he goes, unless I fucked things up, I should be set for life and my kids and their kids should be set for life. Yeah. Yeah. So and he's very, you know, self conscious of, you know, the repercussions of sticking around too long. He had a buddy, he was a 10 of fight, a guy died. So you know, I don't seem this. The other thing with John being out now, all the chips are in Connor's corner.

Speaker 2:          02:04:43       He's the only superstar, legit superstar in town. He's like, listen, you want me to fight again? I know that's the old contract. This one I'm worth. What do you guys want to do this? The only way it's going to happen to him. There is no second. Who else has number two? Name a number two. Joe [inaudible]. It might be steeper and that's time. I mean he's the heavyweight champ. I mean at least it's not the doing kind of a global, they're not even the same relevance. He loves beside of the plan as far as far as the draw. Yeah. Who else is there? Who Bisbing who? George Saint Pierre. Once you fight the Biz, Bang, it had George and then people are going to be a little disappointed with the George numbers. I don't think you can sell to all as you think. I think the people that were George Saint Pierre fans, that's a long time ago, over four years ago and the sport is a different sport now.

Speaker 2:          02:05:31       You're talking to a lot of younger people now that are just getting into it. I like this old guy. It's fine. Cool. He's fighting business doesn't really make sense. Why? I'm the other guys. I read this too. She preview of the fight. It was so douchey. See the thing about that you see getting bigger and some it's these fucking sports guys who write these really creatively negative articles and it was about the Bisping and you're saying you have to read a Promo for the fight? Oh No, no, I read it. Oh God, no, no, no, not, I don't read promos. When you see those promos, he's fret top of the joint. 100% I don't have a plan. I just say exactly what I think about the fights. So like when I do those, the best way to do it, and I remember you telling me that.

Speaker 2:          02:06:15       So when showtime wanted me to cut a pro for right before the fight, I was like, let me just sit down and do it, man. I don't want, just don't tend with do, let me go. Let me think about what is at stake, what is, what's it really means? What's it mean to me? Like how do I feel about, let me just go man. And now shine through. You know, like when you talk about certain moments that you've seen out of a fight or that you show that shows like how special they really are. It gets me excited. Yeah. Like when you talk about like Anderson, when he front kicked Vitor Belfort in the face, like it was all electric moment, you know that he's capable of doing these movements that just look so much faster and so much more accurate than you expected. You know, Anderson in his prime, some of his performances, man, which is so stunning.

Speaker 2:          02:06:56       Now when I'm talking about back, I like the, I don't need a what? You tell me why I know more than you guys do. Who wrote this now and I'll tell you, I'll tell you what I feel. Nobody ever wrote anything for him. No. Yeah, I bet. So it should go away from the beginning and that's why it comes off so good. Yeah. When you hear a guy like reading off a teleprompter and the beginning of a fight, like the promo, the fight, like when they're talking about what, what's happening, what's at stake, it just doesn't feel right. Even if it's like kind of crazy talk like teddy atlas, like when Teddy Atlas least see it's real. It's real. It's real. You got to have real, it's some crazy shit, but it's really reading off teleprompters is just paroled on what? What was the thing you read though with Bisbee and GSB [inaudible] on the fight. It was just some

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       Douchey sports guy article about it and I was like, ah. It's saying that George Saint Pierre is getting off his rocking chair to come out and brown kick some. Nobody in the head. I'm like, no, no. He's coming out to fight George St Pierre. Who is that car? The stack. George Saint Pierre Brothers coming out of a retirement to fight Michael Bisping, who's the UFC middleweight fucking champion of the world widget midway. He took it from Luke Rockhold like people. You didn't say that you want, but he still took the belt and then go out, but the only defendant gets Dan him. What? Who Cares Jed? He beat him. He did? Yeah. He's a legit straight lineage. 185 pound champ of the world. You know, I don't, I just, when I see that fight, I just add it again. Go on my tours and just get seen. The actual reaction face face with fans when I talked about it.

Speaker 3:          02:08:23       It's very Luke warm. Yeah. What do you guys think? We got away for Robert Whitaker to heal up, you know, he's the interim champ and that's going to be a while. His knees pretty fucked apparently. So he's got to heal up his name and you know, once that's done then you know, you get to see what happens after Bisbing fights. GSP. Here's the thing though that with, with Biz and I love busy man. I wish she was a bigger draw, but Bisbing ratio, not huge ratings. Bisbing verse Robert Whittaker, not huge ratings. It's like there's nothing you can really do. The WHO's Luke Rockhold fight and again, he's fighting uh, uh, David Branch. That's right. That's an interesting fight. That's system. That's September what the 16th or something like that. Yeah, and they brand from world's Citi is fine. His first fight in UFC was terrible, but it's also his first, you know, in a long time.

Speaker 3:          02:09:07       He a world series champion, light heavyweight and middleweight. Yeah. So you know, he'll, Gerald Harris knocked him out with a slam and his first UFC fight weight, rough UFC career left, you know, did work and world series, you know, for Luke Rocco. I think it's just, it's more of him just getting back into things, but he can't take this kid light. No, no. Luxo talented man. Yeah, he is so fucking silly. Talented. Yeah. David Branch has won a lot of fights in a row. Lost Anthony Johnson by decision for, that's pretty crazy. Lost a loss as a light heavyweight to Anthony Johnson. Go Up to a Hardee's ripped his leg off. He, yeah, he caught him though. Yeah. And World series, right? Yeah. There you go. No UFC. Oh, that's right. He got heel hook. Quite bad. Yeah. And he's a black, he's a black belt on the ground to second round.

Speaker 3:          02:09:56       Huh? One 44 I felt like I was the first round. You just see 16 Paul Harris more than once. No, just one time. Yeah. Okay. Gerald Harris. So that's where it is. Gerald Harris knocked him out in UFC one 16 lesbian Lesnar versus Carwyn. Wow. It's a while ago. Fuck yeah, that was, that's right. Kale Slam. Yup. Yeah, I remember that. I think that got knocked to the night cause I thought I was gonna get it cause that was really that kind of knock out nine to slam. I'm pretty sure that the Kale Slam weird got an award for that. Interesting. So score go up, go up all the way to the top. He has his hands full with the graph. So yes he does. So he beat Vinnie, who's a phenomenal submission artist. Who else? DP Christoph Jackto decent fighter nine at the time or 10 at the time. But that just shows you where the middleweight division split decision now he beat on.

Speaker 3:          02:10:48       Yeah, but you should know, Cami has never been the same. He, Jesse Taylor, who's the, you know the champ, but you should know Cami after he got stopped by, um, Tim Boetsch, Tim Boetsch and then he gets stopped by Jacques Rey. You got brutally stop bad then he left. Yeah, he just wasn't the same. And that's all, all of that is after Anderson mark. Correct. But I mean, you look at David Branch compared to Luke rock colds lineup. It's insane. Luke Rockhold. I mean, big difference in the world know this is a terrible match up for David Branch. And unless he can rise to the occasion like that, he wasn't talking a lot of shit to each other to have a yeah. Talking Alonda Shit. Weidman. Machida Bisbing Boetsch Philipo he hasn't fought since December of 2000 Oh, January of 2016 June. Sorry. The wild man. And then before that he's on the muckraker card.

Speaker 3:          02:11:43       When you fought Weidman Gregor Aldo, that was the best performance of his career. Beat the shit she hopes for that. Two more that I thought. I thought he looked at his best. He also fuck the big thing up here. I choked him out with one arm. Yeah. Had kicked him to choke down a low. Cut Him with that question mark. Yeah. Applying and then Tim Boetsch, you fucked him up with Tim. Tim Bullshit fucked him up with an inverted triangle. Kimora that cut. That has the Philip who fight the body. They have to talk Costa into walking out to take that fight. Fight. Yeah. Why not? He just didn't, he was over it. He didn't want to fight anymore and my manager was like, dude, if you don't walk out there, this will take a career for the rest of your life. Wow. And he was literally not going to fight.

Speaker 3:          02:12:26       He was like, I'm not going to call his name. He's like, I'm like going. Wow. Aleks Mcmahon was like, you better get your ass out there. I'm telling you, you, you're going to regret this for the rest of your life if you don't grab the why did he not want to go out there? I think he's just over it. The nerves, everything. He was like, I don't wanna do this anymore. Then Luke Rockhold was like, here, let me help you at Gish liver kick get out of here. Yeah. That's the business we're in. Oh Shit. And he didn't want to go. There's a decision that people make when they've taken too much punishment and then they just can't get excited about performing anymore. And it can't get up excited about competing anymore. There's a decision that people make where once they make that decision, you got to just get out because you will never be the guy that you were when you didn't give a fuck and you were hungry and young and you're gonna run into that guy, you're gonna run into that guy, that guy that was you. You're going to run into him. He's there. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:13:15       He couldn't even tell what cost to Philip who looked normal and that fight looks like he's trying to win. Think like once you get in there, it's kind of fight or flight, you know? Yeah. I mean it goes back to his instinct. Oh boy. Luke Rockhold is a very good left kick to the body. His Great, Oh, who was illegal? It's legal kick to the body when you're on the grounds leading up, man, that kind kinda hit his head, but yeah. Did it. Yeah. Go back to your phrase. Dot. Okay.

Speaker 5:          02:13:35       The very end of it.

Speaker 3:          02:13:37       Powerful Vimeo. Not that it mattered. How's that? How's this legally online? Oh, how dare you. Yeah, you're right. Right behind the shoulder blade. That's legal. Yeah. It's kind of weird that you could do that. You're not, can you stomp to body when he goes down? Not really. Right? No. You can ask kick though, Lupe. Oh, that's right. You can, can you like push stomp kicks such bullshit in it. Can you like, if you can't go down stomp, but can you stomp forward? You can do it on your feet because it's kind of like a front kid. It's weird. It's kind of dumb. Right? That's weird. Anyways, I think I liked it with brands where I think Luke, Merck, so interesting. But again, Luke's not a huge paper view. Frolic for the UFC and champion out. You're like, yeah, Luke has every reason he should be. I don't get it. But with John being out, just go, go through the champs. They got mighty mouse ain't happening. No time. No time. They're banking them. No Time's coming up. So I had two fights. Louie that for right in the UFC. Yeah. Is it for, I think he's had he fought Meesha? No Sir. Tim. He stopped. Um,

Speaker 3:          02:14:45       yeah. How many fights did you have in the UFC? It's not pulling up. It doesn't say, Oh yeah, just go to his Wikipedia. I guess. I feel like he's had two fights in the UFC. Maybe said three. Three of might have had three. Three. You might be right. It's not a lot though. I agree. It's not a lot.

Speaker 3:          02:15:06       There was this lady there. Okay. Oh, as him split decisions. Rose p. That's right. That's right. That was a fight he took on short notice. You Fun belts. I remember that. That was in Houston. That's right. But that's just been Merkin death. God, he's just, but you look at the division, there's just nothing for him. So he has to fight desperate or DC. Well, Merkin Misha is not as impressive. All the Mishi has a very good striker and a very good submission artist. He's really good submissions. But that was like, okay. He caught that dude coming in, clipped him with one punch, knocked him out. That's oppressive. But doing it the Jimmy man and why you got to go, oh, okay, this guy's fucking for real. Like if he could do that to Manoa, he could do that to a lot of people think. Yeah, I want to see him do it to someone else too.

Speaker 3:          02:15:47       Obviously you want to see him fight next level stuff. You know what I think's going to happen and I do like him. I chill. I hope he comes champ. Be hilarious for many of reasons, but I think you know his technique of Russia and like that you get to a certain level where it has like DC and Gusto and go, you want me to do what I think get fucked up. Well that's, we can see that led to it. But here's the thing about that level. There's levels to this game and light heavyweight goes DC, John Jones, Gus van DC and then and the second level and then after that I can free for all. Yeah, like what does DC do now? Like if they give him back this high low again, it's tea, but this is the thing in the public's eyes, it's such a tough sell. Like here's the best light everywhere. World new ones like, nope.

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       We've seen him lose twice. Now we see him get put to sleep by John. The second fight you want worst case scenario for you. And I think DC's the late every, all the time we take out. John, do you want, you want to tell you what we're skipping now they go tainted, Supplement Dick pills again, six months, a set suspension. We're going to strip the belt from ya DC. Here's about you gotta fight John Again. Six months. Go get you something here. Just give me that Goddamn belt back. Give me my fucking dealt that like that's okay. But here's the thing. We don't know what was really going on now, right? We don't know with John. Yeah. Now I think we are allowed to have complete open speculation with zero concern for being respectful. Yes. I think after the Dick pulled thing, I go, look man, they do was party and he was taking some Dick Pills.

Speaker 2:          02:17:20       It's like, oh, coke, I don't give a fuck about coke. That's not helping you. Then you hear about this and you go, wait a minute, something's going on. What is this? Yeah. I want to know what this kid's like. JDS got flagged right and they pulled them off France, you know, I only get jds go, come on. All right. That's steroids for sure. Because he's at a clean history with John. It's one thing after another. Well, jds also got flagged for a diuretic. Yeah. I'm just saying, let's say they didn't say anyone's was trace amounts, trace amounts, but with jds, again, benefit of the doubt. All right. It happened once, whatever, but John, it's like come on Bro. And then and then with the Dick Pills, a lot of people are like, ah, that's kind of covering up the third row, you know, recovery therapy for when your on intestines, testosterone and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          02:18:01       Like that's a little shady, whatever. Put that to the side. Now it's like, come on man. Well this is a weird one because this one is, if he was taking what you describe as some short acting quick leaving your system, steroid, some drug that makes you aggressive, you've got to go. Okay. How long was he doing as far I did. Was He doing this during training? This amp him up, this help his work rate. Did this make you more aggressive and more confident in training? Did it add to his confidence when he was fighting? Like what is this? We don't know. We were, we know that story that shale son told, you know that story of the Chelsea and told them my podcast about John being under the entire, like under the octagon when the, when the Sata kicked him out of luck and pissed under that gun right there.

Speaker 2:          02:18:44       This is what they wanted to do. They, they knew that he, this was before you had to expose your whereabouts. He didn't have to disclose your whereabouts back then. So when they showed up at the gym, John Apparently saw them pull up and went underneath the octagon. He thought they would leave. They didn't leave. They stayed the entire time and they waited for the gym to close the gym clothes to shut the lights out. And then John came out of the office. He's crust chill and says chills is really not a liar either. Besides, if he's telling me he's not taking steroids when he's fighting. Yeah. I don't know if he got it from, I dunno. What source channels using, he's pretty reliable, right? He's definitely in the know, right? I agree. I don't know. I don't know if it's true or not, but it makes

Speaker 4:          02:19:28       you think like, okay, well what is that for? Is that for pot? You know, Marty was, he wears a coat, cope with their smoke. There's this much smoke. I'm going to go, what's going on here? Right. What is going on? Yeah. How about jail sown and he, when we had the press conference, he, this is four days before the fight. We're both work. He's working for, I think ESPN for the Mayweather stuff. I'm work for. Showtime comes by, he goes, Yo, Max Kellerman they didn't take you on $100,000 bet. He'll win more than went around a more, right. I went, no. He goes, I'll take it. I went, jail. You take this bed, you're going to fucking pay me. He goes, I swear to God I will pay shakes my hand. He goes, if Mcgregor Mcgregor wins one round or more, you give me $100,000 he goes, yeah, he's not going to touch them.

Speaker 4:          02:20:08       He's not gonna win around. Cool man. Shake his hand. And after the fight, he was literally like, you just text me yesterday morning because, hey bro, I'll be in la. I dropped the cash off. I'm like, you don't have to pay me, man. It's not that sense. He was dead serious. He, I'll drop the cash off. You said no to a hundred thousand dollars yeah. He think he would have said no to you. I do. He would have made you pay. I do this type of fucking, nope. I'm telling you this. This type of dude chill is, remember when Shaylin Nate [inaudible]. Nate fell on hard times. Chail set without Nate Marquardt pipe markup. Yeah. Yeah. Sending him a check in the mail. It was, I can and go through hard times. Here's some money. So when he helped my friend, like he's always had a free pass with me. Oh, that's really nice of you.

Speaker 4:          02:20:51       Very nice of you. It muscle rich. Whoa, just kidding. Not Rowing in. That's crew g one screw g here, but now lots of Conor McGregor rich. Who is these days? Whoa. Connor one fight. Richard a new son. How about Floyd? Alan? He's a billionaire, but yeah, Floyd is probably worth like $500 million now or something. But they said that he owed money to the IRS. I talked to him about that. He goes, he was literally like, dude, my taxes, it's, you know, it's the same equivalent. If they flagged us. He's like, you pay like whatever, 5,000 just, I make so much money. I owe 5 million. I can pay it whenever. It just got blown up in the news. He's like, no one's broke here for God's sakes. It's like a legit point, sir. Good point. Go ahead. Someone was watching. He can keep up that lifestyle though. Would that kind of spending spending's insane. It's not Johnny Depp Insane. Like there's Johnny Depp. Remember we've been over that. That's some shit ball like 14 houses. There's Johnny Depp and say, and then there's Floyd. Johnny. How about two about two houses. Floyd Mayweather become boxing's first billion dollar fighter. Can you name the other billion athletes? Uh, tiger woods. Michael Jordan, tiger woods, which was surprising me. She got 500 million. Come on. At least that'd be a savage. Nah, she savage. But taxes. If you don't really have a billion when you have a true, you have a shitload of money.

Speaker 4:          02:22:13       She got a hundred [inaudible]. She had two Hundo.

Speaker 6:          02:22:15       Ooh,

Speaker 3:          02:22:27       made a billion knocking out a little ball off that dirt off that delicious drink. Oh, that's right. No, no, I'm just kidding. Tiger Woods estimated at 100 million chunk chunk. It's a lot. It's a lot of cash. Baby baby sat. That's a lot of cash. Bay Bay, Bay Bay set. Did you see that video and tiger got arrested for drunk driving. You know, it's hilarious. He's just fucked up on pill he was on. Did you see, I think they found six things in a system. Why did he drive on pain pills? Because tiger woods who told them tiger woods but doesn't he know like, Bro, you just got back surgery and you're taking like heavy duty opiates or whatever the fuck they're given that he's taken. What was he taking? He was taking a barge or ship a fulls eyes or show fuck dude. Time Shave your head. Take it from another bald guy.

Speaker 3:          02:23:18       Let it go. It's like that song from the movie frozen. Let it go. Let it go. Can you just got to ditch that shit? Yeah. I mean he's not good looking guy anyway. He terrible bro. He would worry about that nonsense you got going on there. Just go ahead and wear glasses. If I was to Cochise too, man, like you have $1 billion bro. He gets 100 million but clear glasses that Connor was wearing. Some of those like Dave Chappelle's went some that I definitely want to get there. It was like a brown for frame and they weren't so dark where their sunglasses, they were like tinted were look cool. You get those. If you have a cock guy, know what the move is. He goes with like yellow aviators, hunter s Thompson style, and just starts dressing like Johnny Depp and just starts flaunting the fact that he's a freak.

Speaker 3:          02:24:07       I agree that your freak flag fly fricking freak go. So he's tied to the system and all that. And of course more all that's true. Nike's still fucks with the money. A lot of people do. No really good companies even after this. Yeah. Do you remember how big, do you remember how Big Tiger Woods was gone? Thai? Yeah. Again, made golf like cool. Yeah. That's the guy I saw my house out in that bitch. Oh my God. He had Vikatin. Yeah, and dilaudid. Jesus Christ. He was taking some shit. They gave people that were dying of like bullet wounds in the old west days. Miladin and Xanax. Christ. You know what? Hey Man. Andy say a sleep, drugs. Xanax. Xanax is not asleep truck.

He likes to party. Yeah, man, that's a lot of shit. Go back to that place, but he doesn't really play golf anymore yet. He does, but he's not doing good. He was found unconscious in his Mercedes Benz, which was parked awkwardly on the side of the road and had damage to the driver's side. What are you doing? He hit a bunch of shit. Did you hear how he fucked up his back and knee? Have you heard this story?

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       No. He was upset because his father was the military. He's obsessed with military. He actually trained with Navy seals, like put on the full thing. Went through this navy seal train, like obviously not real shit but doing all the marches and shit and fuck this stuff up. That's how I fucked himself up. No, it's one of the ways he fucked his knee and backup was like intense, like navy seal training, like shooting with them and stuff. That's so stupid. The secret history of Tiger Woods, is that what it's in there? Fire article. The death of his father set are a battle raging inside of the world's greatest golfer. How he wage that war through an obsession with the navy seals. It's tell the tale of how tiger lost his wet. I haven't read this either. Wow. Yeah, man. There's a thing. I agree that you have to have mental toughness to work out hard and to get through brutal workouts.

Speaker 2:          02:26:15       You have to, you have to, don't gotta go navy seal on a bitch though. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying you got to build your body up to that and you are a different person. You're a fucking professional athlete. You're not a warrior. Going over to cs to take bullets, fight for your life and kill bad guys. What you're doing is a very specialized thing that it's worth a fucking billion dollars. And you're also hitting that little tiny ball on this calm, quite golf course. I don't need you to be in the waves trying to learn how not to drown and fight sharks. It's like taking a dude who bought a brand new Ferrari and taking them on one of those crazy dirt courses that they have those a off road Porsche's drive on. You know those, uh, you've seen those things. Those guys are like, they have one guy next to him.

Speaker 2:          02:26:54       I never, I need to ask someone what the fuck they're doing. I just have like Chris Harris on. I'll ask him. There was another guy with a notepad. He'll rally cars the map and he's going to clicks left turned right. He's as navigator. Yeah, exactly. He knows the whole course like dead on. Who's reading it off a book? Yeah. Or just use mapquest says those guys are maniacs. Pull up some video of a rally drivers or get rid of the fucking dead weight, telling you the directions. Use mapquest with the boys. You can't, but they could step up their APP. Gaming. Do something. You have to have. That guy needs a job. He's job studies. The Colin's taking care of the guy with the fucking notepad, but, and he knows like how long it takes for you to get there too. Because if you're driving it, you're fastest.

Speaker 2:          02:27:38       Even if you're off our five or six seconds, you're in. The neighborhood knows what's up. Those guys are wild, man. Those cars are so it's like such a different style of driving because the dirt makes the, the tires break loose like constantly. Have you ever considered going that the Porsche track here? We can take all the cards though. Let's do it. I know. Don't they have a new one near the lax? They have a new one not far from here, but the guy was telling me that like great restaurants. He's like just book. It will take care of the car. They take care of the Thai. No notes go cars flat out scrooge. Mcduck sample edibles. Give that gt three Rs while it's fried. Some go need some copilots. Let me do my thing. I come on. Don't go full circle all season on us.

Speaker 7:          02:28:23       Yeah, we can. This guy 61 now. Holy Shit. They must be fast friends. Jesus dust flying. They're best friends. You'd have to be best friends. Hey Bro. Wow. This is nuts man. See that red light?

Speaker 3:          02:28:46       Yeah. That is a, a sequential manual. It's a manual, but you, you just push up to go up and down to go down. You don't have to find out here. Good speed, right. The quickness. Yeah. Yeah. You don't have to find

Speaker 7:          02:29:01       the perfect year, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:29:03       give, you're using that h pattern. You're going up and then you go on down and you go up to the right. Yeah. So it's down three down, two up one. You know, the, the, the way you're doing it is, it's very different. Although my new Porsche Pete Pdk will shit on this. Yeah. Yeah. It'll shit on it. But this is probably more fun for this not sitting in traffic on that road. I assume that dead he traffic. Yeah. I go down the canyon. I just opened that bitch. I have take some risks too. Yeah. But it's not as fun as driving a manual to me. If I, if it was like the one, if I was driving in traffic all the time, I would, there's not a chance in the world. I would want a manual. You don't drive your gt three and the four oh five sometimes not five in the afternoon. Sure. I do. Really? Yeah. Even like, Yup. Oh Wow. Yeah. Well you just like, sometimes it's like driving that thing. I just want to drive me to like sometimes I'll take the long way home or at night I'll just jump on the Pacific coast highway 2018 BMW m five pack 600 horsepower and m x drive all wheel drive system. Woo 60 and 3.2 whoa. That's a big car to pay for the extra day. That doesn't top out at like 140 it'll it tops out at one 11 unless you pay for the package.

Speaker 3:          02:30:20       BMW needs step their game up though. I feel like they're losing the battle with everyone else right now. Well they say Sadie's is just [inaudible]. It's definitely ahead of them. You know what BMW has coming out though? An eight series. The eight series a sedan. Divina back. Do you remember you she removed the eight 50 yeah, the front end. They were all, she wants to have one of those. Katie who's got a them to the comic store back in those days are a nightmare now. But yeah, look at this new one though. Oh Shit. Go full screen sun. Look at this. What? You're only seeing the front of it. Wait till they go on the side. Look what this thing looks like. It's wicked bad. Damn. That's like an I eight but not the electric version. No, no, no. It doesn't look that space. Shippy no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          02:31:01       You know what it's like, it's like the BMW or the Mercedes s class coupe. Yeah, those are, that's what it's like and it's this, the big body. Um, uh, I'm assuming a twin turbo. I don't know what the fuck that's got under the hood. I think all their cars are turbo like date 50 back in the day. Look at the back end though. Damn. Nothing is bad them here. They'll spin around that. I ate pissed. That's a tron car. I test drove that. They're like, get the fuck out of my face man. Too many different colors too. And you know what? It's going to skinny tires. Yes. Can't fuck it. I need fat tires. I don't even like the tires on the corvette. How about that? I need some fat ass tires even though the will, the drug room dynamic. Shut your hole. I liked the way it looks.

Speaker 3:          02:31:43       I like fat acids and fat tires and Tig old biddies fix 10 nothing is dope. Pretty sick. You used to have the m six right? Yeah, them six I think it was fun, right? Nothing was a monster heavy straight up v 10 heavy smoothed down highway. Right? Yeah. Nothing fun in the tribe. Now that Porsche gts is, you know, they say that's the best of the Porsche's. There was a article that I just read in one of the car magazines that said, uh yeah, see if you can find rag to my friends. Go to a Porsche. GTS is the best Porsche. It's like a very recent article that I actually read this morning on Google type move. Yeah, they were saying that it's the best version of it. You know, you've got your gt three which is like super hardcore. I test drove that room and I called you.

Speaker 3:          02:32:27       I was test driving the gt three and I'm like, Joe, you love this thing. You said, unless you got another vehicle, man for you drive every day is a bad idea. You'll get loud and get it to pull. The GTS is low too. I escaped the Front for Felony Crime. So another interest. So, but the gt three has a button that raises yeah, yes. Front end. The GTS does it. Well it's not the GT three. It does because you buy it that way. [inaudible] options that will option wasn't there. But tech art makes um, a a, an aftermarket one so you can get that and get it installed and it'll raise it up. I know a bunch of Porsche dealerships that do it. Yeah. My gts, yes. My gt three has an aftermarket. Oh my gt three saved the day I have to park on the street cause my driveway's like this. Yeah. I had to take one of my, um, one of my other buttons from something else and have a dedicated to that, a gt three button. I matter of fact, I think they took it from a blank and they installed a button in it. You have a blank where you can put it.

Speaker 3:          02:33:25       Mine's right on my, uh, my rear view mirror. Rather when I go, uh, near something, I'll hit that button. It was the best car on earth. What did you say was a Porsche gts? 2018 Porsche gts is the best. Uh, nine 11, they were saying they were just going over like, it's like hardcore but not too ridiculous. I got a gt three Rs and that it's pretty slick. Do you see that one guy? He spent a shitload of money to take you as the Porsche. That brand new gt three Rs is only um, PDK. They don't make it in a manual. Says guy spent a shitload of money to have a six speed from a Porsche nine 11 are installed in a gt three rs cost so much. He must just be scrooge. [inaudible] screwed, screwed up all the Porsche. But if you even have one of those things, that's it.

Speaker 3:          02:34:13       Pull up, pull up the top of the article. What does it say? Quick take, not the fastest nine 11, but possibly the best. When is it from August. Yeah. The things that today's fun. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Well it's not the fastest though. The nine 11 turbo turbo so that things are God damn space machine like that. This time. Have you test drove one yet? 2007 or 2000 I'm not seven. Uh, 2009 or 10 I drove one. The new ones that I test drove faster, the gt three and that, yeah, I was just in love with my car so fast. There's stupid fat and they're four wheel drive, but the new ones even fast, way faster than that one. The one that I drove her insanely insane. The GT three. It's just you. I felt like it was like hard, but yeah, so hardcore that you, you would love the turbo if you got one of those new turbines, you'd be like, what in the five test drove that and the gts gts module with that.

Speaker 3:          02:35:10       I, there's my, cause my car, it's like that lava orange, it has the duck wing on it. It's just like a vintage Porsche to me like that. Right. I saw on the show them right away. I'm like, that's it. I'll look at these own that. The judge. No, I'm like that's it. I test drove g three everything and I, I just let him know doc wing the duck. Cause when I was a kid I always had saw a poster for a Porsche and had the old school doctors green and I forget how to duck wing on it. I'm like, that has a duck way. Yeah. That's like, and that's important. 73 Rs. It's so cool man. You know those cars was 1973 RS is a worth over $1 million now. So sick. Like why if you bought it back in the day was like 20 grand. Now it's worth $1 million.

Speaker 3:          02:35:49       Why don't you do you, aren't you doing some with a Porsche school porch? Not that old school. So 1988 [inaudible] 86 or something. Shark words. Just turn the thing into bay. It's a um, uh, an rs America and nine, six, four, just like one of the last, the air cooled cars, the last, the air cooled was the nine, nine three, which is like a little bigger. This is a nine, six, four. The air cooled, everyone's obsessed with isn't shown. It's just a different animal. And you get them pretty cheap too. You know, they're just not, it's not. It's different kind of car and if you go earlier than that, you get me cheaper. You can get them pretty cheap for like the 1980s cars. I seen him. I seen that one that I found. It was a 78 Kirra and island, but it had some reconstructive like stuff to it look fun.

Speaker 3:          02:36:37       It's a bad investment because it's like, oh, I saw that car. You send me a picture of it. I want that. Yeah, those are ass crazy man. Those things through dangerous. Do you know about how to drive house like you when you, when you take taking turns you have to keep your foot on the gas. I know there's no, if you let off the gas they have throttle overstay like what does it call the throttle led off oversteer or something. I'm trying to, I'm trying to go out like James Dean. That's exactly what it was. Silver too. Well, they're really light. Yeah, I know. They looked fun. They feel different. Like my friend Alex from shark works has a nine six, four and his, it feels different because they're so small. It's like it's, it's you're more connected to what you're doing. It's really light and really small, which is cool.

Speaker 3:          02:37:19       Yeah. Swishy this day, like going down to paying a cane. I'm not using it every day. Cars think it'd be fun and I want a new bronco as a daily driver.

You'd have to be a real long task. Can you imagine if I drove it? What is it, dude? This is the car. No, Jay cut. You're an asshole. We can't be friends anymore. Yeah. Oj Simpson's White Bronco Escape car. Wow. It goes on sale for $700,000 as a former agent decides it's time to cash and decides it's time to cash in.

Speaker 3:          02:38:10       Right when Oj is getting out of jail, I was just going to kidnap this dude and go back to jail cause this guy sells his Bronco for 700 grand. That's his fucking whip, man. He's going to stab you. It looks pretty good shape. I like the wheels. Right? Right. Should we get it as like a company car? Some shit. $700,000 that is the cost saying what year was it? [inaudible] 93 right? No, it can't be new. It wasn't new at the time. I don't think God [inaudible] 94 police chase. What years?

Probably made some extra cash. I've already seen it. The pawn star guy turned it down. He did? Yeah. He didn't want it could move. He said, I don't want that bad Juju. Am I below that song? Well, there was blood in that car, man. Was it? Oh judge. Yeah. Yeah. He cut his own hand with the knife, allegedly. So sketchy. Did you see him get a released? Like when they only gave him parole? Did you wash that was crunk and will just judge you did. It was like a huge football fan. Do you know that? But this is saying it's amazing shape. I drove it around and found a little odd, but it runs great.

Speaker 3:          02:39:51       You found a little odd. Did it smell like murder if it smelled like dead bitches? God, Bro. I watched it live. I was in Italy. I wasn't gonna miss it.

And Tigo from a Porsche or a Bentley and the jump metallic. You'll all right. Kind of basic. Yeah. Interiors or basic. You're spoiled. Spoiled. I know. The German was a little baby thing. Gotcha. They got me. It's true. Right? There's no American equivalent to like a Mercedes s class. They just don't quite get there. We just went out there and it's not weird.

Speaker 3:          02:42:49       Like, why don't they get, they're like, why doesn't someone just dig in and go, let's just throw our fucking Dick into this hat through. Let's just get our dicks and then the third here. Fucking yeah, just build some beast of a fucking like what's the best America Lincoln like you'd get a Lincoln. No, because no one cares. No one cares for the older crowd. Yeah. You show up at a Lincoln navigator. Fuck shorty from 94 not a bad car. The new ones are actually pretty nice. I know, but the point is it's not a Mercedes just cut. What? American car can you pull up and shit on people now it's comfy. Nothing Eldorado now that they don't have a viper, you can't even pull up in a sports car now. Old Demon. I typed in American muscle car and it's just muscle less. You still kick ass.

Speaker 3:          02:43:35       I'm talking luxury car. Well, they have the market cornered when it comes to muscle cars. When it comes to a stupid car with a giant engine that makes a ton of noise, we're killing it and it uses a manual transmission marriage all day. They still make the corvette. Z O six in the fucking manual. It's one of the few cars that Germans are the only ones in the Porsche. A Porsche is the only ones that have had the balls to come bring a manual back after they took it away. Ferrari still hasn't figured it out yet. They refuse to tell. Well, because Douche bags it buy Ferrari's. They're all just trying to floss. Trust of them. Don't even know how to drive one. Not Real. It's not. It's not a track car. Have you seen that Porsche Turbo can buy? It's like the platinum edition. The wheels are made out of carbon fiber and the whole it's gold.

Speaker 3:          02:44:18       It's a, it's like a dark, like not like scrooge McDuck gold coin, but it's like a gold color. Bring that shit up dude. It's this, it's this special Porsche turbo like platinum edition, platinum edition turbo, but it's in gold. How I wrote a goal and then it has black rims that are carbon fiber. Dude. Why is it platinum edition? But it's in gold. Shouldn't it be in platinum? It should be platinum. I Dunno. I think he's scared this issue. It like, remember when Justin Bieber had that? That chrome Fisker Fisker fan. I saw one the other death taught brides split dope. It's dope. Look in the catch on fire and there it is. It's about my bat exclusive series. Look at that thing. Joe, buy this, buy this. That's your niche, right? Look at that thing. They're tough to get to. Are they? Yeah, when I want it. Well cause it was tough to get ones here. Like still figure it out. No, we'll figure it out. I'm not driving a gold car bro, Bro. That's not gold.

Speaker 3:          02:45:20       What color is it then? The platinum edition. You are right. The platinum edition a but it adds another 66,000 under your, it's your tag. That exclusive series. It's fast, luxurious and delightfully gold. The beautiful special edition. We limit it to 500 units worldwide. Hey, guess what? When you make something cool, make a bunch of 'em you assholes. Now I'm going to buy them. Make an exclusive only to have it. I don't want it. Whoa. Look at though. That fucking thing is nasty. Looking at zero to 60 times 2.8 seconds. That seems excessive. How's it going to get shorter than that? You're not even three seconds. You're going 60 miles an hour because with those, those new rims that are all carbon fiber scope, how sick is that? Those rims are dope. I was skeptical at first. Those rims are killer. I like the black stripes too.

Speaker 3:          02:46:09       It's a nice car, but you know what a lot of people don't like the way nine 11 turbos look like. What did my friend when you get into that cannot be my friend? It's a first look at that fucking car, Bro. It's bad ass. The stripes on the seats. Ooh, that's what it comes with. That luggage to Jamie, Bro. I would flaunt that everywhere. Got Damage, but it's like how much does it cost? 66 I think 66,000 over. Well, you get to watch Justin coop and the $257,000 but no, it's more than that, right? Ooh. Ah. It doesn't come with the five piece luggage. Another sixth grade by that pitch. 6,000, 324 for the luggage service. Every penny, how much you get for the watch. Dope is that thing though. It's nice. I prefer silver, especially that thing that is a spaceship. I mean your flex on people.

Speaker 3:          02:47:08       If you pull up in a cold pour, a hundred percent match matching luggage and I'll watch pull up in a red Ferrari and double-flex you. I don't, not in that thing. I feel like I've seen fries. Yeah. I was in Italy and a guy had a Ferrari in Italy. I'm like, this motherfucker has a variety in Italy. He went, it's pretty classy. It was red right in front of this beautiful hotel on the Amalfi coast, on that guy is bald. And he probably had something to look at that Jamie. Fuck. Damn. Jamie Foxx. Jamie Foxx has a shiny gold Bugatti. He wins and a gold wheels. His wheels are fucking gold. He wins. Jamie Foxx wins. Yeah, go back to, um, the, um, the, um, what is the, um, the new Ferrari?

It's like if you buy a Ferrari, Ooh, that's a four eight eight special edition Sun lighter with larger appetite for Apexus. That's the like the race version, but that's a shitty picture. Go to a video. Ferrari for Aa like that has a beautiful car, man. That's exactly what the guy had in Italy. That is a big thing, but I'll tell you what, what it looks better than that. The new Ford Gt, that thing sick, that looks better than that. That it, that might be the American Ferrari. Oh, it's, it's based off the front to copy the front of that thing. Go full screen, Jamie. I'll take the hips on that pitch. That thing is, Ooh, Jamie, do you get this stuff? Does this do anything for you? Get Boring.

Speaker 3:          02:49:02       You pause too hard. Yeah. I don't think he's velvet ropes around. The stupid thing won't let me fucking get my Paul's.

You didn't have some problems with it with a Porsche. You never have problems. Really. Yeah. It's like the difference between a girl who does crossfit and she's got like thick ass and big legs and his shoulders are a little stacked and she a address. Right. Versus a girl who's like a model who's going to turn an ankle if she goes to the beach with that other than say the crossfade curls going to like eventually breakdown cause crossfits and shit.
