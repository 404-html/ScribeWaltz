Speaker 1:          00:00          The general good experience, that's another thing you keep saying, aim low enough. Have a low enough bar. Why do you. Why do you mean that? Well, let's say you've got a kid and you want the kid to improve. You don't set them a bar that's so high that it's impossible for them to attain it. You take a look at the kid and you think, okay, this kid's got this range of skill. Here's a challenge we can throw at him or her that exceeds their current level of skill, but gives them a reasonable probability of success, and so like I'm saying it tongue and cheek to some degree, you know it's like, but if you're. But I'm doing it as an aid to humility. It's like, well, I don't know how to start improving my life. Someone might say that, and I would say, well, you're not aiming low enough.

Speaker 1:          00:39          There's something you could do that you are regarding as trivial that, that you could do that you would do that would result in an actual improvement, but it's not a big enough improvement for you. So you won't lower yourself enough to take the opportunity. Incremental steps. Yes. And so this is also what is achieved through exercise. It's one of the most important. Yeah. Well what do you do when you go and lift weights? You don't go in, like if you have a bench press before you don't put 400 pounds on the damn bar and dropped and dropped the bar through your skull. You know, you think, look, when I started working out, when I was a kid, I was, I was weighed about 130 pounds and I was six foot one was a thin kid and I smoked a lot. I wasn't in good shape.

Speaker 1:          01:17          I wasn't in good physical shape and I went to the gym and it was bloody embarrassing, you know, when people would come over and help me with the goddamn weights, here's how you're supposed to use this. You know, it was humiliating and maybe I was pressing 65 pounds or something at that point, you know, but what am I going to do? I'm going to lift up 150 pounds and injure myself right off the bat. No, I had to go in there and strip down and put my skinny God damn self in front of the mirror and think son of a bitch. There's all these monsters in the gym would be lifting weights for 10 years and I'm struggling to get 50 pounds off the bar. Tough luck for me, but I could lift 50 pounds and it wasn't very long until I could lift 75 and well, you know, how it goes, but.

Speaker 1:          01:55          And I never injured myself when I was weight lifting and the reason for that was I never pushed myself past where I knew I could go and I pushed myself a lot. You know, I gained 35 pounds of muscle in about three years in university. I kind of had to quit because I was eating so God damn much. I couldn't stand it seeming like six meals a day. It was just taken up too much time, but there's a humility in determining what it is that the wretched creature that you are can actually manage. Aim Low, and I don't mean don't aim and I don't mean don't aim up, but you have to accept the fact that you can set yourself a goal that you can attain and there's not going to be much glory in it to begin with because if you're not in very good shape, the goal that you could they could attain tomorrow isn't very glorious, but it it's a hell of a lot better than nothing and it beats the hell out of bitterness and it's way better than blaming someone else.

Speaker 1:          02:46          It's way less dangerous and you could do it and what's cool about it, there's a statement in the New Testament, it's called the matthew principle, and economists use it to describe how the economy in the world works to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing. Everything will be taken. It's like what's very pessimistic in some sense because it means that as you start to fail, you fail more and more rapidly, but it also means that as you start to succeed, you succeed more and more rapidly, and so you take an incremental step and well, now you can lift 55 pounds instead of 52 point five pounds. You think, well, what the hell is that? It's like it's one step on a very long journey and so it's, and it starts to compound on you. So a small step today means puts you in a position to take a slightly bigger step the next day, and then that puts you in a position to take a slightly bigger step the next day.

Speaker 1:          03:36          And you do that for two or three years. Man, you're starting to stride everyone who's fighting in these older leagues or if they, if golden boy, if that's your thing, to do like these, this master league, everyone fighting that lead better. Pray to the MMA. God's Vituro Balfour does not enter that fucking thing. Juice to the gills. Oh, have you seen lately? Yes. You better looks amazing. Fantastic. So happy we will. We'll kick the fuck out of all those old dudes at the same time. He really. Well Dude, I was looking at his instagram the other day. I was like, oh my God. Yeah, there's something happens to veto or when he fills up with super unleaded dude, it's like butter and Jelly. He's a different roads bro. Like some people don't. Don't, don't do well with Roy to get all red and shit. He looks great.

Speaker 1:          04:19          His skin's vibrant, his tits are popping. All Tans teeth get wider. He's doing straight testosterone. He's not mean when he was on. See, think about this, right? We know for sure. We all know absolutely 100 percent of the people have cheated and taking steroids and got away with it. We know that. I know. You know that. Especially in fighting, especially when the weigh ins were the only day you had a pee and there was no randoms. That didn't just come by. We know for a fact, but when you watch someone who's just doing testosterone and what else is doing with human growth hormone and fucking gigantic now. I love that. I love it too, but what you get there, it's a different thing like for Vittorio, like something happens with him, like when you, when they allowed him to take it, like during the rockhold fight and bisping fight dude, his body, he ate it up, but that's kind of a different thing.

Speaker 1:          05:16          First of all, under control. I was always a happy kid but not really because I was always confused about the death of my father so I'd always have happiness, but I always had the Catholic faith. I was raised Catholic. I always believed he wasn't having that. He was in that box from my mom did the things, so these the pain a little bit. Then my mother's death was just fuck it, and that broke the central nervous system belief system that broke your belief in the world. How can there be a god that takes a mugger away from a child when you're 16 and you wrap that around? Your head does not a good result. It's not going to be a good result. So how I lashed out was by robin you. That was the only weapon I had was to rob you. Joe Rogan fucked me.

Speaker 1:          06:11          This studio would get robbed and living on fucking fire and Joe knew was and what the fuck was he going to do? I'm with Columbine. The fuck you going to do it? Call the cops. It's Karma. Going to answer the phone next time. Don't fuck with me. You'll know next time. Not The fuck I tell you to give me that gram of coke and I'll pay you on Friday. You'll fucking give it to me, right? Because that's what it was. It was simple shit like that. Like, Joe, give me 100 bucks. I broke $100 bucks. Okay, now rob, your fucking house should have gave me the hundred bucks. You know, I was lashing out of the fucking world. Number two. The other issue I had is I lost a child. I loved the job. I was not ready for that child at all. I love that little girl with all my heart, but I was not ready for her at all.

Speaker 1:          06:57          My intentions are good, but the result was not going to be well. I was not ready and because I lost that child and I'm a no contact with that child, it makes me a better father than I am today. This is never going to happen to me again. You understand me? I see. I see the, we see daughters of comics, we've seen daughters of comics, comics and if fucking lost, you know, I don't want my daughter to be fucking lost. And that stupidity in the net world, you know, you have to be that. We have to be there

Speaker 2:          07:37          dealing cocaine. Oh good. Like to that vest story man. So here's what happened. So I, you know, I would get using cocaine at thousand, put on these different vests. How many did you buy it again? I don't know. I spent too much on them, but I would probably say the price. Yes. One I had was probably about 200. $10. 90. Damn. Yeah. And so I would get fucked up and put these vests on and put on sunglasses and not let them know like Buffalo Bill Shit. But at least party and by myself, you know. And one time I was making a smoothie, you know, because I, you know, I have, I got like a new unknown what kind of or it is, but it's pretty nice and I was making like a nice smooth, you know, I'm fucking coked up on partying and you know, living high on the hog to vests on maybe.

Speaker 2:          08:19          Right. And I thought, I thought I heard something outside. Right. Which is kind of weird to even think of when you have a blender going, right? So I'll leave out of my apartment to go in the hallway, lock myself out with the blender going in the morning, coked up out of my brain. Now I have to go to my landlord dude who lives right down the hall and tell him like, hey man, I got logged out Glenda's on. Oh my God, he must have hated you. Owe the blender shorts out and smoke happens. The fire alarm starts going off in the building, right as I'm at his door knocking right now. He's pissed and he's like, what's going on? And I didn't know what to say. I told him that I was throwing a late Christmas party. It was fucking into January. I will with you at the time. Huh? Oh, this is two and a half years ago. So was 30, 35.

Speaker 2:          09:17          So he comes back to my apartment, right? He's, he unlocks the door. There's nobody in there. Oh my God. I'm like, man, but that's it. It was fun. Oh my God. No, that was fun. How long had you lived there for? I still live there. Yeah, we've passionate, you know, like I've caught him doing some things. I think we're all even. How long have you been sober? For? Two year. In two weeks it'll be two years. What was the big thing where you like, oh, I gotta get my shit together. You Die. What was going on? Opion Jim, when Opie and Jim Norton had a radio show at serious and it was actually on a, it's on [inaudible] that show that he had. This is not happening. And I ended up, uh, doing coke all night driving a taxi. I was in a taxi. The driver is due to Luigi.

Speaker 2:          10:19          Um, got me an escort. I didn't want to escort, we're doing cocaine and like Harlem or something north, the cab driver doing coke and I just had, I was taking a cab from a party to my hotel and so we ended up off on this other excursion. Next thing you know, I'm driving the taxi. He's in the back with the hooker. It's 5:30 in the morning and I got to be on the radio station at 6:30 or something. So I get to the radio and I can't even talk. And uh, and darryl strawberry's the other guest, right? Who's the baseball player who also had drug problem, but he's like 13 years sober. And so it was this weird moment where like, I thought I was kind of cool, but then here's a man who like, I'd always in my head maybe somewhere thought, oh, that guy's like a cokehead within here. He is eloquent, put together, successful in here I am, I can't even talk. And I'm with two men that I admire. Um, you know, opie and Jim Norton, just to be honored to be on the show, you know. And so I was like, this is, I'm, I'm not making choices. Like there's some, there's some unevenness here, you know. And so what did you do after the 2012 step program? 12 step program. Yeah. And then so yeah. So I've been in that. Then since then it has helped me out, you know.
