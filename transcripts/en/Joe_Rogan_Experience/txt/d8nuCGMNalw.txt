Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches.

Speaker 2:          00:03          You know I think about that last year I did blow. I was ready to call 60 minutes. Okay. Think of this state of mind right now, like I had already a pitch for 60 minutes to explain to them that I had found the cure for cocaine. If you do heroin on Mondays just a little bit, you will not snort the rest of the week. Like I was really going to pit 60 minutes. I was going to get an agent and go to CBS and the list. I got a groundbreaking idea. There's no reason for rehabs. We'll get that white powder you motherfuckers are going to war for

Speaker 2:          00:35          and we'll get that little white poppy seed will make it into some pill and we'll get people high on Monday because the rest of the week I didn't want to get high. How crazy is that? I was doing heroin on a Monday and it wouldn't let me do the rest of the week. I look forward to Mondays. Fox, CSI Miami. Why only Monday? I Dunno, I dunno, I have no fucking idea. That was just a week off, right? That was just snorting it. Yeah. Snort at two little lines of heroin just to get me out. And what does it do? Like what's the feeling? Hit. Tell me what it feels like when it hits you. Oh, it takes a couple minutes to hit and you feel this weird thing and then you feel like your blood pressure going up and you feel like this euphoric warmth. You feel like this fucking to. I felt like my body. Did you ever take a white shit? It's warmer. You can see if you shit outside. Steve's gonna come out of it. That's what your body feels like that one and then I would get an urge to puke

Speaker 2:          01:34          for a couple minutes. I would gag and Puke a little bit, would come out of yellow and then after I put a little bit, I would just go into this state of fucking bonus for four hours. It was like smoking in their cars all day and mum onus, like just sitting there smoking a cigarette, looking out a window, and I'd make believe I was writing John Lennon type lyrics to until I looked at them the next day. This brilliance about a refrigerator. Like I remember writing a bit about a refrigerator once and looking at it the next day and say, thank God, thank God I never tried. You know what I'm saying? Like little things like just, well that was hedbergs drug of choice and his jokes, man,

Speaker 1:          02:17          it's, I think he's probably the best nonsequitor joke I ever because all his jokes are unrelated. It's like here's a nonsequitor. Here's some other things I was thinking about. Here's something I thought his, um, I saw and it was like, I was listening to it the other day is like, half of his jokes were only funny because he was saying them, you know, but they were hilarious. Like he had a, he had a way of doing it that was Kinda like heroin comedy, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:48          Would they be messed up during the week or no? Who? Uh, it takes me a day to recover on Tuesdays I'd be out. I didn't say nothing to nobody. I was doing the and I wasn't doing cold showers. Really Fun. So you would be like sober Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and then he'd look forward to the big bump on Monday? Yeah. The kids that used to send it to me, he used to send me $7 bags. What kid? His name was a bonehead. He died from an old date. How weird. Yeah. Fairy that counts to live forever. I knew I knew bonehead from my restaurant piece. Last phone had Bergman taste about bone health. Bone health was like your boy. He was. I could go into a room with 90 motherfuckers in bone that will liquidate of them. Bonehead was a bad motherfucker dog. I love bump on her three brothers.

Speaker 2:          03:39          I love Dalton, but bone that was in two of the brothers were very successful and bleeding bone head was successful as a plumber. He had his own company. He only went crazy at night bone. That bone head when I was 17, would take me to mcsorley's hell house in New York City Id. He called the bartender. I'm going to give them three mugs of beer, given three mugs or beer and give him a bowl of Chili. Mug would take 10 bucks for the both of us and he'd go to Washington Square Park and he come back and he gave me eight volumes and by the meantime he would go by his heroin and they buy these mixture of pills and they melt them to the black and whites. They take us to a strip club in New Jersey or something and they take us home and the next day, seven in the morning, that strip had this bone head in the fucking in the fucking a plumbing van up and Dan that he was a functioning addict. He wasn't like your regular. There's a lot of those guys out there and he had a check that was a 13 bailey. She was half Asian, half Irish, and they used to do heroin together and they'd pass out in the living room late fucking. They both go to sleep and then I'd be in the bedroom because I just moved in with bonus.

Speaker 2:          04:58          They were Italian. They were real fucking the talents and the mother used to. The mother was the first person ever made me an eight grade. She was a little Irish chicken and she said that she used to say the word Earl. She couldn't say oil and she was the bookkeeper for union 52, whatever. The teamsters, the Labor unit. I was over there one day when I was 16. She goes, you've got a book, walk me to work tomorrow. Get your book. You can start fucking being it. So I, you know, like a hod carrier, like hod carrier for the brick masons. She goes, I can get you with the Italians or by the brick mason. She was from hoboken, so she got me a book. I financed that. She got a loan shark to finance it. I love these people. This is, if I'm thinking it might be, I don't like doing documentaries, but I need to do a documentary about this family because it's the rise and fall of American family.

Speaker 2:          05:50          I saw before my eyes as a child that went over there and ate with them and hanging out with all three brothers by the like I wasn't just friends or bonehead with Chrissy fish and I hung out with the little whatever his name was, but bone hood was my nighttime guy. Bonehead used to take me into the murky waters of the underworld. He can get me guns and shit. Another medium brother was a drug dealer in the eighties and he drugged he so big times coke and he used to buy jewelry and he used to put them in a tackle box. So one night me and the younger brother in the bed, sleep and bone had comes in the borrow money from us because he was going to the city again, heroin. And he goes, he and I got it. I got to go to the back.

Speaker 2:          06:30          I don't have any money on me. He went into his brother's room and instead of his brother was sleeping, the drug dealer, instead of just opening up the tackle box and taken $40 out, he took the whole tackle box and it had $40,000 cash and was 30 and jewelry. He went to the Bronx. These are the best times in my life by comrade is your war stories and you saw that house was haunted and this was not a hunter, so the house at all these people were decent Italian people. Dad was a longshoreman and the mom was in charge of the teamsters union and they hung out with westies. They hung out with the fucking. The mother was friends with this dude that was a a whatever for the West East and he used to get me jobs. He would get me jobs, casing joints. When you have a summer job now, he would tell me, come in, I want you to go that warehouse.

Speaker 2:          07:19          I'm going to give you $200. They're going to give you one 80. I want you to go in that warehouse and write down all the alarms and tell me where the safe is. Walks around the safe and he would pay me money. This was a great house. Stop old school Italian announcement back the bonehead bone. It has the fishing tackle box. He's about to go upstairs to buy heroin and shoot it. He puts the tackle box and the garbage can in front of the building and puts a lid on it. When he's upstairs shooting heroin, the garbage bin come and they take the 40 large with the $30,000 fucking jewelry to understand me. I mean this was nonstop. Le Bonheur came home high on heroin. He decided to make French fries, so he put the pot out, but that this. Remember in the eighties they had those pots.

Speaker 2:          08:04          You could bring it home with the hot oil and they would boil and you could throw French fries. America went crazy over him. I forgot what they were praised everybody. Everybody was making onion rings and shit. Well, he did heroin and knotted up and left. That thing went on fire. Of course, we're all on the fucking house. Oh Jesus. All right. I went into oil. I wake up, boom and alarms and awesome coach waking me up and we'll go out of the house and the is outside. The grandmother and the fire department crawls on top of the roof. Joe, when they hit the fucking roof to let the smoke out and fire trucks are coming from the side land water and they got the sirens in the middle of all this had taken them on and we all look around and go, oh my God, Emile stonehouse, bonehead was still in the house on fire, Bro. They turn the fire off. They go in and he's still with his feet up with his. Just heroin out of his mind.

Speaker 2:          09:00          He slept through the fire. Oh my God. Everything. When they woke up on my fries, ready? Crazy. This family was ready. We have to fucking battalions after nine slash 11 hours. Are you still fucking sleeping? Oh my God. It burned the house down. Burn the fucking kitchen down and half the bedroom. They had a movie for a hotel for six months and they had a grandmother downstairs. It was old school Italian, but you couldn't smell, so we kinda, we smoked pot. We just got on there and blow smoke in his face and grandma would pass out in the wheelchair and that was the end that. I mean it didn't stop. It didn't stop genius. So this is why you get mad at people for binge watching stuff on Netflix and this is what you were talking about. I get mad at everything are you got to bother me for.

Speaker 2:          09:49          I get mad when people like he used to hide the coat. The medium brother. He used to hide the coke on his car and I'd be walking down the hill and I could see a little container that he didn't even have a Maserati. What's the other Italian call is how much of a guineas? These motherfuckers. What? What's the other Italian car like you said? The avanti Avanti. Oh, okay. I remember those. Remember that piece of Shit? That was a piece of shit. Pieces of shit.
