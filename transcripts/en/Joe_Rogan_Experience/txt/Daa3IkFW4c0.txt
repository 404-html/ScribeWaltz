We had some time about 13 weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       I'll just hold my breath. Can you do that? Are you good at holding your breath? I know you have awesome cardio to fish. We're good. I'll just suck on this coffee real quick. Usually go to bed at 11 sip tea, usually in bed by 11 sipping team guys, are you really? Yeah. 11:00 PM Evan every night. Wow. Are you training tomorrow? No, I trained twice today cause I knew tonight's gonna be a doozy. When you, uh, when you schedule like your, when you ramp up for a fight. So you're fighting December, December, December, December 6th when you're racing on h one. Oh Shit. Where's that beast? Vegas. Mandalay bay. Ooh. Two title fights then my fight and Travis Browne. Ooh, that's um, Vitorin Weidman to showtime and Melendez. Oh Shit. And then us big one. Good Lord. Uh, not yet. Not that I know of. I don't want you to go seize unless there's a chick flight.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       And I hear you speak in a chick. The one tonight is telling you guys she's a little monster that you got an issue with her. I do. So filter thinking a little crush on her. Yeah, she's Kinda hot. She was a little plump and she got in some serious shit. Yeah. Right. And it has down like, she's like curvy. She's like Kim Kardashian, but Japanese. Yeah. Come on in. How cool would it be if she came out and, uh, the school girl uniforms, they used to do that for pride. He used to come out with pigtails. Weird stay one dude. It's the national pastime is to be into school girls. How weird is her biggest thing that she's ever done? She dressed up like a bunny. Ooh. I know this, I don't know dirty, but maybe I did some research and by research I mean maybe I jacked off. Um, we'll let you know as soon as the fight start. I don't know why. Uh, the fights are a little bit late. It says 1205 on my phone. Amateur hour smells like weed in here. Says 1205 on my phone. I don't know if that means I'm somebody fucked up or they're having a problem. There they were, we were watching it earlier though. It doesn't make any sense. It was the live from Japan Goldberg and, uh, Brian Stan calling the APP

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       action. Maybe it's just a delay for the main card, by the way. I fucking love fight pass dates. Awesome. If fucking love it tweeted that fight pass is great. And everybody was like, you fucking chill. I know. It's great. Any fight you could think of in the UFC, you could just watch it and it works. It, it's crazy. When I cornered Ben Saunders at, at the Tulsa event, I get there Friday night, I've never worked with Ben before. He asked me to corner him like a week before and he goes, dude, you want to come down? And uh, he had been playing rubber guard off and on over the years and he was playing a different version. He was playing a version I never played. And uh, then he kind of moved away from it because I figured, I figured that it would, he hit hit, hit a dead end with that style, but I didn't want to say anything cause it was kind of working for him.

Speaker 2:          00:04:09       And then he got cut from the UFC, went to bell inventoried when, when somebody lose some and I kind of lost track of what he was really doing. And then he saw the Hixson video, the video that we did here. And, uh, he, he, he twittered me direct message was, hey man, when are you going to do a seminar in Florida? He realized he was playing stuff wrong and he wanted to fix it. So I said, well, I don't have anything planned in Florida, but I do have a little rubber guard genius out there. Guy Named Tyler Woolsey. I go, let me hook you up with them. They hooked up. He, as soon as he, as soon as he got done with Tyler, he said, dude, I want you to corner me next week. Can you do it? I know it's last minute. And um, did it. And so Friday night I get that Friday night and go right to his hotel.

Speaker 2:          00:04:51       He has fight pass hooked up. Right. So cause he was studying his opponent, his opponent, and I think, hmm. It wasn't on, he wasn't, I don't think he fought in the UFC before, but he had bypass. So I said, Oh shit. So we put on, I wanted to keep it really simple form would rubber guard. There's, it's so sophisticated and so vast. There's pieces of the rubber guard that I don't even know how to play yet. There's new pieces. I'm like, Shit, what are you guys doing over here? Right? There's a new shit that's incredible. Half Guillotine a guillotine from the rubber guard. Guillotine with your leg

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       on. Hold on a second. It's on. The fights are on guys walking out. Right? And what is this? I don't know what you got here. Oh, is it a different thing? My on the wrong thing. That doesn't make any sense. Live events. Let's see. Yeah, you gotta press live live now. That'll be it. So it didn't switch over from the pre. Oh, it didn't switch over from the prelims. That's goofy. That's goofy. Tell you what a different stream is. Coffee, bulletproof coffee, French jobs got a little bit of a fucking coffee problem. Addiction. And when I stopped siding, it's going to become drugs. Well, my point was with the UFC fight pass is I get there Friday night and we kept it really simple, simple rubber guard, Michigan troll with elbows. We, we put on Jason Day versus Alan Belcher. Uh, that was a real, an amazing display of elbows from, from the guard and Matt Horwitz versus Dan Miller.

Speaker 1:          00:06:18       You know, just right there. We would've, it would've been hard to find those fights, you know, I guess you could go to MMA core. It's always tricky though, right? You're like tough to find that. Yeah. Yeah. But with UFC fight pass man, boom. Any UFC fight, is it every single fight that the UFC has ever single fight the UFC has had and every single one. Another one of those too. There's everything yesterday on the phone too. Yeah. Um, every single fight in pride to even the early ones, like u of c to everything. Everything. Everything. Wow. All the Strikeforce fight. Cause that's one thing that I can think of came up. But I'm like thinking maybe, maybe the, the old ones, maybe UFC one even there's offered he sure if I'm wrong I apologize. But I'm pretty sure in between, in between these fights, that's, let's throw it on my glass so we can, we can, otherwise we'll go off the screen because it's running through my laptop, but, but we'll figure it out.

Speaker 1:          00:07:07       I don't, I don't think there's anything that's not in there. I mean there's also a crazy show called UFC now with a couple of cutie pies on their Kapow, Brendan Schaub and Kenny Florian. Damn show relevance, Horny and Shit. Man, man, himself and his girl, he's talking about himself being acute. It was true. Oh, you don't even paying attention. He said Brandon Shab couple cutie pies like Brennan and shop. You got to talked to in the third person. I'm, I'm sorry, I was just really paying attention to you. She's, I'm used to that with Callan. Don't worry. Just keep on keeping on towns the worst with that. Like he'll get into modes where he wants to, he wants to say something and it doesn't matter what the fuck you're saying. What he has to say. Like it has no relation whatsoever to what you're saying. Oh Wow. That's great.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       I met a guy, he wrote a book and I'll go on to this fucking, why are you talking about economics now? Like how do we get an economic, he's like, he has this thought in his head. It's like a runaway train. He's just trying to get out of the way, man. That's why he's so funny too. It's like what's his face you recognize about comedians? It's like that same thing that makes them like really funny. It's this, this mad dog bum rush to get attention. Madness, man. Nobody's better at like commanding attention and count. Brian called me. He was dead serious. He goes, Bro, instead of selling t shirts, I got a great idea. He's never came to me with an idea for shit. He goes, good coozies we should sell to God. I went, are you fucking kidding me? Disease? Yes. Who Buys Beer? Koozies still put mean. W how much of it is just a little insulated? I thought you meant jacuzzis you going to kick

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       can out of the warehouse. You would need to keep an inventory fighter in the kitchen that's not there. That makes, that makes more sense than a Koozie. But first for a second, I'm like, they get, damn, they're jumping on Brian. Poor Brian. But then you said his idea. I'm like, oh no shit. [inaudible] trying to sell Jacuzzi. What Natalie that I mean who? Well, it's

Speaker 1:          00:09:23       got room for a Jacuzzi. Kai, Kai Yohji. Horry Gucci. I don't, I'm not familiar with him. Who's his opponent? Do we know? We've got to pay attention here. I got a bad ass because I've used it once. Seriously, three years once. Let's see who these guys are there to fight in here. Powerful Aryana in Japan. Oh, la. And seen her in awhile. I thought maybe she was taking a break. She's well, she's busy. She's got a TV show now. Really? Yeah. She's on overhauling shush. She's the host. Oprah. Yeah. Spike. Right. That's uh, that's bud show. Brian, her Gucci and Delos Reyes. That's bud show where they take a card and they, they, they completely redo it for like a week. He doesn't get it. Yes it does. Now that's back. But what owns it again? Or it's a producer over it again. One of those things that was his show.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       I don't know what happened. I, you know, I'm just happy he's doing it to get, oh, it's all over. It's all never know. Never know the smart thing. Recovering. Yeah. He's, he's on the bottom. You don't recover from that. You can't let this though like this though. He can. You can. If the guy stays on him. See if the guy was smart and he's a striker. If he's that good of a striker, he would probably try to get away, right? Yes. 100% because that guy would be much more helpless in a non clinching. The rubbish from the standup to Leo Machida told me that you get hit to the body, drop to your butt and to buy time until the ref Stan job. Well, Tito did that with him. Remember he, he caught Tito. What? That body shot that need of the body. That's pulling guard though.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       It was a slick move by. That's pulling guard. He's being sued. You're going to get finished. He's peeing. Eddie Brown was being sarcastic. He's a master mastercard player and 90% I think 90% of the people won't catch it. I'm just telling you right now, I know that Eddie Bravo humor, you've got to stand up. He's, you know, he ended up to him it's like, it's like chess moves that are like really stupid. You see someone doing a dumb chess move and you and I are like, what is he talking about? Well, other other people you know who know Eddie and know exactly what he's doing. He's, he's always said that. I mean we're seeing it. We saw it with your arms. You got to pull guard. We saw at times you got it. You don't, it shouldn't be our first option, but it should be. Look how, look how good Ben Saunders control was.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       It was amazing. If I'm for doom and Keynes, eat me up against the cage, I'm pulling half cars sometimes. Sometimes you have God. Meanwhile, this is a good fucking fight. Yeah, it is really good fight. He recovered. He got out of it man. But that a hard gootchie dude, that guy's got a nasty left kick to the body. Oh, he's trying to pay him back for oh he did too. He did two or these guys, 45 hours. Um, they look on no fibers. See I was going to say 35, 25 no, no. I wait. Oh my God. Giant. No Way. Well, you know these hoes shit. No one is really a fucking fly with anymore. They're all like 150 pounds and then fly away for an hour. I mean that's what's going on now with all these weight classes. Dude, you know I have dolce on, Jesus don't, she was telling me that nick lense walks around it like a buck 70 a buck 75 and he gets down to one 45 and he was struggling to get down to 55 before he came to dolce.

Speaker 1:          00:12:50       Either way, there's going to be diminishing return. You know what I'm saying? Like I don't care what dolce says and I love dolce as much as the nice guy, but no matter what you say, that can't be healthy. I'll tell you what though, be that big. No, no, but there's, there's healthier ways to good generally the healthier ways, but it's still kit. There's no way performance. He says, well, he says it. I think you're right. The Way Nick Lens cuts though. He was saying yes, he walks around to one 75 or whatever, but, and he does get to 45 but he does it. Oh, he heard him again. Oh Jesus. He's boys a scrap and these guys are, oh, heart. Gucci is a bad motherfucker. Eat soon. Jesus Christ. Nasty striking. But he dos Rios got some gummies back again. Oh, but he's getting eaten up. Oh, these are hard shots. Oh, he's in trouble now. He's might be that. I usually stop. That's it. That's it. He's a bad man. Shit. The kids here, the kid is teas. Is that a bottle of wine? You savage? Of course he did. Yeah, he would bring wine camping. If you let a kid, he'd be that guy on a hunting trip.

Speaker 1:          00:14:01       Brian, I'm on your side today. Okay. I'm not going to gang up on me and you kid against these guys have to worry about my feelings by before he came in. I feel a count sacrifice. You guys came down to me a little hard. You didn't believe my nose story. I mean it was very bad. 40 came in and he goes, we should sell koozies which sell pcs. I was like, Nah, I don't think so man. As Brian and Eddie Bravo was thinking you should probably sell like some sort of hot tub type equipment. Maybe Jacuzzi. The equipment just missed this part. Gucci's a bad motherfucker, dude. These are slight weights. Can you believe these are one 20 fibers perspective issue? Yeah, apparently it is. They might be the four foot five. No. Um, there is this, the height is up there. Crazy. It's on the, the thing one guy, 65 inches.

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       You have to go 66 and I have a new boyfriend so it doesn't really matter. Oh, Brian Loves Akiyama. It's importance without beautiful man. He's a beautiful man. He's a, he's a well, but he always sings voice of an angel. I know he saves our superstar. Correct. Like Korea, right? Auditorium, Japanese. He's got an amazing voice. Well, he's a Japanese guy, but he's of Korean descent, right? I believe so. Set from him, I believe is a Japanese name. Yeah. I think for some reason, and he's got some sort of a Korean background, I'd look, but my teeth with my, uh, Jamie, can you, he's actually Korean and Jamie, do you have any one? He's half Korean, half Japanese. No wineglasses dude. This is a man's place. He's a good coffee mug. You use a goddamn coffee mug. You don't need a special glass for your fucking fruity drink.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       Brian. Brian figure Brian style cause enormous. He looks like Godzilla compared to that dude. Oh, so that's why it's a perspective issue. I'm with you. As I said, that guy is a bad motherfucker. Super Bad. Wicked striking. There is no room for anybody but bad motherfuckers at one 25 every a black belt and everything, everything. And in a black belt in cardio 70 and below, you better be a black belt at every job. Oh, you won't be here that small. Especially in wrestling and Jujitsu technique. You have to be so technical to just survive in the sport. Bang home. Yeah, in everything. Right. Everything in everything. I like. I actually like watching the lighter weights. Dude. When you got a guy like a Hector Lombard out there, what terrified of that guy who's not terrified to him? To Hector Lombard is terrified of himself. That's how scary Hector Lombard is. Dude. I'm never saw anybody ragdoll Jake shields, the way he did tossed around just smashed him in the first round like a fucking hurricane. Like refrigerators were flying down the street and Kansas tornadoes.

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       It was just, Jake shields is tough as fuck. He's beaten some chicks, feels almost caught him. He almost caught him and he gets him. He got locked up in the bell, rang the fucking Buzzer rang with Jake on his neck. When you look at Hector Lombard, he can't believe he gets down to one 76 he's got the street from a nice ass on the planet. Yo Brian Cowen. Russell. Why Bob? I'm sorry man. I'm so sorry. Hold on. Fuck Buddy. Hold. Get a little 2005 book Hojo, Yo. And you're actually knowing what that would it is 2005 book. Did you like buy it on purpose? Like you knew what it was when you went out to buy it. How did you find out? You'll say taste it and you tell me. No, I believe it's good. I'm not questioning when you know. How do you, what do you know about one? Because I like old world wines. What's that mean? The Europeans like earth in their wine. You taste that earth. You say that. It's like, it's like cheese. Meat. Mushrooms are good. Yeah. I don't taste

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       any of those things. I taste wine. Callup fucking people married the American palate likes an obvious Jamey big wine for the most part. Bronco with the old world wines. Listen Gentlemen, serious question. Who? Who has the best acid MMA but without question 100% and do a lot of dead lifts. Watch health watch question without question. Why don't you a couple of honeydews couple of honey dews with common stressful for us. Without question. Hector lumbar. I couldn't peel my eyes from the man. He was in the air in the airport and he was quite the security and he took his shoes off and I could not feel my eyes from his ass. You know, there's a few guys like that in the UFC didn't move. They move it like a notch over. Everybody Woodley. Tyron Woodley when Woodley's on correct. When he knocked out Jay, her Ron just expose the movement.

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       It's like get out of the way. Just get the fuck out of the way. When he's got this rush, you certain guys that have this rush and Lombard has it too. You know? They asked Woodley to fight Lombard and he's like, Nah, I'm cool. And it's showed up. By the way, Dana said he was like, Dana was like, no. He literally was like, no, I'm good. I say, same thing too, right? Find non cool man necessary the baddest dude on the planet. No, I'm cool. I'm good. I'm going to go crazy. Is it that Dana will bus these guys out like that? Well, hey mean that's for his business. That's the best move. But it's not even like, you know all the guys were like, oh no, hell no. It's like they won't even consider it. Well, no, no, no. Is that 100% true? What are it's, here's the thing, what are you selling?

Speaker 3:          00:19:29       If you're selling a product like the UFC, I could see two arguments. I can see one argument where you're like, you shouldn't talk about that. Cause that's private. That's the fighter's business fighters fight. But you're selling the baddest motherfuckers on the planet and the the push is always like the tank Abbott. Anyone anywhere. Anytime. It's one thing everybody loved about tank habit was the fact that he fight anybody off a bar stool to Tj Dillashaw cowboy Cerrone's exactly like it's a double edged sword though. It's a double edge sword Franklin about that. Oh well it's most likely. Depends upon your success. I mean ask anybody UFC about the benefit. Finish your point. What were you saying about Joe? You were saying you went, you were talking about in the planet, but him, him saying if someone turned down a fight, right. It's like now you will believe him when he says this guy will take any fight. I'll tell you know I could call them up anytime. Like Donald Cerrone, he, he'll say that about ceremony. I can call Donald Serone up and say, Hey, I'm sending a fight with fill in the blank. He goes, all right, let's do it. He probably has a Budweiser in his, he probably fishes the Budweiser, then goes jet skiing. Then probably fucking shoot some guns. What were you saying about age? What were you saying about [inaudible] j Dilla shot. Well, he's another one. He'll fight anybody. Tj fought, I mean they changed it. His fight to Joe Soto

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       the fucking day of the Wayans, the day of the weigh ins. Burrell can't make weight. Falls hits his head. Joe Soto who had won the belt toward title, lost it to Joe Warren got signed by the UFC one, a bunch of fights in a row. Good fights came to the UFC. He's fucking debut his UFC debut. He fights for the title against Tj Dillashaw. Dillashaw. I was like, I'll take it that. That's a little different. I think that's a little different. It was day of the fight. He's in shape. He's in camp looking for a fight. That guy steps up. That guy's kind of screwed. It's a different kind of animal to call some like Yo Hector Lombard, you've got eight weeks. Like cool. That's a different animals fighters out there that get off on fighting the scariest guys. Oh yeah, for sure. Who's like that? Like they want the next, he has Mark Hunt, Mark Kahn.

Speaker 4:          00:21:39       He wants the scariest guys. Yeah. Like literally like when me and him are going back and forth on Twitter, the stuff you'd say to me and like me, I was like, damn, this false for real. It's like he just wants to help my ass. I'm trying to get paid and get a title shot. Joe, he just wants you to whip my ass. By the way, this guy kind of McGregor. It seems like the kind of guy I'll take all comers. So is Dustin Poirier a man, Dustin Poirier. He's a bad motherfucker. That's a significant test from a Gregor. I figured Gregor's sensational. I even Gregerson say I'm a huge McGregor fan. Boxing is phenomenal. Well, his movement, he just, he's like a snake like his in and out, but I'm telling you we haven't scoring Yay is fucking legit. I agree. I can see him winning. He Eric Coke.

Speaker 4:          00:22:24       I was like, Oh shit. Yeah, that's a coin toss. You and anybody could land a big shot and change. Really good fight though. Those guys are both really technical and and Mcgregor is very unorthodox man. He fights from a south position. He moves like a snake. He's trained for. He's got this in and out style. That's very deceptive man. It's not, there's a lot of dudes and you see them throwing punches and throwing kicks, but they're very mechanical, right? Step forward and they just throw a, get a rhythm. But Mcgregor's got like this wiggle, he's got this wobble in and out. He can, he can counter off Google almost Anderson Silva guys into these things and then counters heal, heal, heal. Did doc come back with a right? He's just really good box jack slacks. It did a great slip. He slipped. The guy wasn't in the UFC.

Speaker 4:          00:23:14       He's just does stuff that you don't usually see. Don't think he's ready for a, for like a a top top level guy. I want to see him get built up. Dustin Poirier is going gonna be, it's a hell of a big test look. Poor. Yay is no fucking job shit. And the kid has been fighting for a long time and he's not. And he's young and he's not scared of it. And it got, yeah, it's true. And a guy like poor Yay is a guy that you could see a giant jump from him and just four or five months because he's in his confidence groove now. He beat coke. You know y'all, you know he's, he's at the stage where he's like, he knew coke

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       was about the fight for the title. Yup. When the fight got called because of injury, coke is like set to fight for the title piece. Yeah. He was ready to fight for the title. So poor ea beats him. It beats him convincingly. I mean, that's a big fucking wind, man. He's a beast. You know how we're talking about guys who take whatever fight. Just go. Yep. Give it to us. There's a fine line in this where management comes into place because the fighter should always accept the fight. Always a five. She always right. Always accepted by Ivo. Anytime I man, let your manager saying, Yep, let's do it. It should be a manager's job. Like, ah, probably not homeboy like manager being the guys who is his ego is presumably not attached to any bullshit. A true fighters who like, yeah, I can beat anyone in the world came to me.

Speaker 3:          00:24:30       But when you're dealing with at, say you have a client at one 70 and they go, hey, we want to fight Hector Lombard in Australia where he lives once you fly down to the 20 hours to get that ass, well you gotta fake. It ain't going to, a manager's going to be like, I don't hold out a little bit. Yeah. And there's, there's, I mean you've, I'm sure experienced it yourself. The difference between you now and you when you're on tough, if you could go back and fight you when you're on tough, you'd probably beat your ass. Oh my God. I've last 20 seconds. I was such a bad ass. I was, I was so shitty. Just super competent. Just crazy confidence. What do you think of the APP with the girls? Just two episodes. Yeah, I did. You know, I fucking love it. Do you write?

Speaker 3:          00:25:16       It's really good. It's good that rose, that rose. So I trained with her endeavor when she very first started. She's your next showtime Pettis. She can jump off the wall. She can do flying armbars she's a little pieces there. You seen her flying arm bar finish. You've seen his flight. She is going home after this chick. Have you seen it? No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's a, she's going after this chick. I mean, they're going to war and roses. Chase her down with combinations. The grow clinches up with her. Rose throws out fucking perfect flying armbar and tasks or she's your next superstar. If she does well on this show, she's going to be your next, her a grinding grappling on the ground and position. I don't know. That's the only thing. She's more fancy. You know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. I had sex with someone might be able to take her wrestler.

Speaker 3:          00:26:03       Yeah, you might be right. You might be right. But God, I very flashy that fucking reply she's doing flying armbars that she's gotta be at least a pretty good blue belts the way she did it. You got to see the way she did it. She did it like a goddamn black belt. It was like, you know, sometimes there's those people that like they have one crazy move and they're like, oh, do a shrimp from me. Right. What the fuck? That's true. They came in shrimp [inaudible] bar. It's cause they came to the gym and the first day they came in they showed him a flying triangle, a flying arm. But that, but they can't do anything else. The first fight, uh, that a huge other areas. There it is right here. Do you remember when, uh, paid a pano fought Vinnie Magallanes and Vinny magalogs caught him walking shit. Full flying trend data. How wicked was that? Uh, she's at that pictures while to look at her. She's, she's, she has the rice. Why?

Speaker 3:          00:27:00       If you watch that again, that if you watch it again, look at these. He's not a breath look. And he said, don't think so. No, no, no, no, no. Let's see. Her legs are in a very bad spot as far as an armbar. Let's see. Look at her legs. Look at this. Boom. Left leg. Look at her and left leg between the two arms. No. Her left leg is between the girl's legs. Well, when at the end of it wasn't though, right? Yeah. Let me see. I see it again, but at the end she looked at her arms in her left leg. Look at her left. Boom. Left leg left or you're right. It's your trash leg about Jan Galera. That was glaring. Yeah, that's true. I don't see it. Well, every day I'm analyzing every book like I'm an analyze mode. The whole time I'm just looking at everyone's techniques.

Speaker 3:          00:28:06       I can't help it every time. I'm just correcting. That's so true. If she got into the situation, you think she should have tried to finish it before she got her leg free or if she felt strong, should she had gone for it the way she did because she was obviously tangled up like that wouldn't immediately in trouble was going on in your mind like maybe she thought, I know my legs in a bad spot, but she's not. She's just leaving her leg hanging so I'm just going to keep it there. I don't know. She must be pretty confident in that girl's right leg was just like dangling over. She was amazing it to defend, but damn. How quick did she hit that fucking flying armbar man, that shit was beautiful. She is the attitude to be a champion. I'll put this down. Wild man and that whole wild dance.

Speaker 3:          00:28:45       She did have the chef. She's definitely the hottest one. That's uh, that's, that's important too. It's a legit, she's and she's a trashy. She's with Jet Star and she is here by the way. She is beautiful. Her face is Angelina Jolie. Yup. She's a cutie pie. She's a straight a cutie pie. So be respectful. Good work. Yeah, he did well.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       Oh, nice knee to the body.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       Yeah. That is like a standard like masculine look now the big crazy beard, everyone's kind of doing it. I know everyone's kind of doing it. It didn't exist just a few years ago. Well, it's weird. It's kind of like the tramp stamp exist in the 70s it's all cyclical styles come and go. Okay, well you give it a lecture. Is that why does some trends and like why do people, our sons are growing beards. Wah Bell Bottoms. That happened. What is it? How do, how does it trend? Do me jeans, skinny jeans now you got big guys means it's so interesting how I think it's a culture. It's something happens in a culture and it manifests seven how people just pop in pop culture. They see celebrities doing it. Then they jump on. And Brendan, are you using the diamond club? What do you use to diamond? Yeah. Diamond Cup. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:01       Only the best for this hot. Have you, I hear you brother. Have you ever uh, fucked around with a tie steel cup? I have. Yeah. Once it gets more in the way of things, especially grappling. Have you grappled in a lot? Well, that's what I was to know. I have never grappled in a tie steel cup, but I would imagine that first of all, you know I rolled with you remember Amir Amir? A mirror? No, the other, I've already near Renovar bed. I rolled the mere renova already at legends and he used to roll with a tie steel cup on and he would mount. You had used it as a weapon. It was really rude. Dance with it too. Strong guy. Anyway, he's a strong guy. Crazy. That is so crazy that

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       the IB, Jj have outlawed cups. You're not allowed to protect your balls because of their, so it cups are so dangerous. I agree with it. I agree. We are not alone. I agree, but I think like a s a cup that doesn't hurt like a diamond cup. I got softer Plastic Cup I think should happen. This should be a foam one, but you know what I mean, Tim. I broke my balls once. I had Blake Dick Bleeding once. You know I only, I only wear a cup when I'm fighting. I'm only where a cup when I'm fighting. I never wore a cup in football all the years. Really. Only when I fight I work up. Cause it cause you might get kicked in the balls. No. Oh well you have to wear it in the UFC. I was saying we are one if I didn't have to one of the military because why?

Speaker 3:          00:33:25       Because there's liability lost a ball. One of the military guys got it. Forget his name and in training and it was one of those things where you're like ah, I don't need a cup. We'll just go, go live. And you sent me, you got you hooked. Got me hooked up with the Diamond Cup. Since you told me the story, I still don't give a shit. What's the difference Armstrong did with one between a regular dog watcher has one nut. Remember that if you, if you think about like Lance Armstrong, man, first of all, Lance Armstrong, like you could never do what lands storm was Armstrong was dude in the UFC cause you'd get caught, you'd get caught simply because he's taken a lot of drugs. I think that maybe him taking them out of drugs was one of the reasons why. And one minute, one minute, I'm the same being some chemicals were involved. I The fucking science experiment, man. He was a fucking science experiment. What everyone was though. Let's be honest. Everyone says you're 100% right. She'll sign it, said it best. You know Chell son was talking to, he would know. He's like, look, the guy was the best cheater. He goes, that's what he was. He was the best cheat here. He probably gets some genetic data with baseball too. They're like, oh these guys steroids. Woah. The pictures on steroids too, man. I hate to tell you at the level level playing field, oh it's over.

Speaker 3:          00:34:50       We missed the ending. We're talking all this shit. Oh, you hooked him on the left Hook.

Speaker 3:          00:34:56       That guy is tannish Oh, oh. Ah, that's got to hurt. Ugh. It's tough though. If there's anything to suck at in MMA or to not be as good or suck in comparison to your opponent. The scary thing is striking. God Damn. That's why a guy like a lumbar is so fucking terrifying because he does both. He does both. He ever see a video of him breaking that dude's lag and grappling competition here at snap. You've seen it as Hector Lombard part of his leg? I don't know. It looked like an ankle lock, so probably his ankle or down

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       by horrifying. The bottom of his leg. I mean he just snapped this dude's leg. You hear it? You hear the crack. I don't remember what kind of leg lock it was, but it was nasty. Did he hang under like Paul Harvey Stone? It just snapped it. It just, the guy screamed and it was over. He's a fucking freak dude. Okay. This fight is not over, man. That was just in between rounds. Jesus. Wow. That guy is still in there. Who, by the way, who is fucking tougher like PR as I like, uh, if you had like a generalization about a nation for tea, like guys who can take it. I know, which, I know these guys can't fucking, I actually know that they've actually gone through the hardest. So they've done some studies on that. People that can endure the toughest. Don't forget about the basics.

Speaker 4:          00:36:26       The toughest, toughest soldiers, they say traditionally are Koreans and Turks. Their ability, there's legendary ability to endure hardship and stuff. That's interesting. But then again, you would think Mexicans is tough. Mexican's Koreans that are really good. There's a few, Korean fighters are really good. Korea started to build like this really good base now. Well, Korea was in Baden 400 times home. Enjoy making a comeback. Izzy. Yup, I heard looking for scrap. Is he getting his pituitary gland operate on? He's one of those guys. He's like 600 pounds. Who's going to fight him? Nobody. But like big foot was like way over 300 pounds. Remember he fought that dude. Uh, the big Jujitsu, uh, Eric Guy from Hawaii. Eric Palae. Oh, Eric Pale Ale. Huge guy. A big foot. That's right. Back in the day. I think Eric Palae beat him. I think he knocked him out. It was that an elite Xc, goddammit.

Speaker 4:          00:37:21       I don't remember. Find that Jamie. Eric Palae versus big foot Silva. Man, I can't remember what happened that, but Palae was huge. She was like 300 pounds. This is this, this big giant [inaudible] you hear Mark Hunt started camp at 340 pounds. What? It's nice and light from Barbara. I know. It's beautiful. He's in good shape. 300. That's what you want. It really may barely made weight. Had to [inaudible]. See, I've heard 14 year old Simone. Keep it all that way. Just the blueprint of healthiness. Just he's an animal. I'm a Mark Hunt fan to the end. I'm a mark so far. I think everyone's a Mark Hunt. You have to be so fun. And by the way, he's got some of the most beautiful walkaway Kaos. He's Kao Stephan Struve and usher and yeah. Yeah. Chris Tucker. And uh, how about um, uh, Chango God damn that precision with that left hook. He landed your black Bot.

Speaker 4:          00:38:18       Scary dude. Man always toughest fuck. And by the way, barely throws any leg kicks. He's got legs that are like fucking telephone poles. They're the most frightening legs. You think? If that guy doesn't really throw him, he would fuck guys up if he threw a lot of leg kicks, me throws him occasionally and they have a lot of power behind. His legs are enormous. They're fucking a new one. If you block it, you didn't get fucked up, dude. Anybody who doesn't incorporate leg kicks in their game, if they could have been there when I was first starting to do commentary and I got to see Pedro, his Oh fight when he was in his prime kicking Randy couture's buddy, we'd be doing leg kicks. It's such a ruthless weapon was in the hand of a guy like Pedro, his, oh Jesus Christ. I never heard anybody's leg kicks sound like that before crack. Oh, why inspired me to go and kick the bag like hundreds of times more just being there from him doing that. Maybe want to work out your leg kicks Brit d crazy. My man. I guarantee when we trained with Dwayne at your house, you are kicking it all hard and my uh, my best friend and my brother were there. You're like, ah, brighten your term. I was like God damn

Speaker 2:          00:39:26       joking. Kick like a mother fucker. Ridiculous speed and power. It's hard to kick after him. It's weird. I tried to follow him and comedy. Yes. I was trying to be funny. I like made some joke or something stupid. We tell some stories before, man, man, we got in the car and my brother was like, you a rolling guitar in you? Huh? I'm like, yeah man. Better kicker. Fuck you guys. All right, big deal. Hey check. Check this out. When he caught up maybe 15 years ago, I was hanging out with Joe. We dropped off his car to get a new stereo and we had a kill. I got two hours. So there was a gym across the street, kickboxing gym, owned by some Middle Eastern brothers that were going to come full and kickboxing. Aw, sweet. We just go, we show up, we show up and Joe is just hanging out.

Speaker 2:          00:40:15       And I asked the guy, I made it seem like we were interested in joining. So I asked them, I go, what kind of kicks do you guys throw here? And he goes, oh, we do with these kids and those kids. And I go, uh, uh, can you, can you show me what kind of kicks you throw here? So he's all warming up, stretching out, and he's about to kick this bag and he looks over at Joe and he sees Joe like shadow boxing and all. But as Joe Joe didn't want to, I wanted to say I was setting them up. I wanted him to kick the back first and then have Joe kick and look at his face. I, I've done this before, like at John Jocks, there's like an old thing that I did and I, and I was setting him up, but before he kicked the back, he looked the Joe and it says, have you ever trained?

Speaker 2:          00:40:52       And Joe didn't want, he goes, yeah. And it goes in what? In a taekwondo and the knee. It goes for how long? It was quite a long time and he goes, let me see what you got. So then Joe said, okay, so Joe murders, this fucking bad, destroys the fresh after he gets done with this fear, this flurry of hurricane cakes, that guy goes, hey listen, fuck that noise. He goes, I do this for a living. If I have a kicking contest with him, I can get hurt my classes. I'm going to teach. If you guys want to come to the class, I'll show you this guy, dude, he's a smart guy and my mind where he's kicking with Mike Della rotting, whatever his name is, guys play podcasts. He doesn't know Mark Telegraph. I watch that fucking, I watched this shut up. Shut up. Both of you.

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       I watched that video. We work with a fucking professional fights. No near the top 10 heavyweight. No worries. I've seen a lot of guys kick out like I've grown up in Jim's, I've seen Duane Ludwig. I'm just saying the hardest kicked I've ever seen. I'll go on record saying, this is Joe Rogan. It's not just because he's my boy. It's the hardest cake I've ever seen. Crazy shit. And I thought it was gonna be talking about my boxing. Right. But no one said Shit. If I'm talking about Romans kids as like, yeah, pretty cool. Fuck that guy anyways. And just, you know, it's like damn man, nutty shades insane. If you've never seen it, check it out. I started doing it when I was a little kid when I was trying to tape for King of the cage back in the day. This was like in 2000 I would work with Joe every now and then.

Speaker 2:          00:42:27       He was trying to show me some shit and man, I was holding back from an, I felt that this was like 2000 2001 and I'm thinking are kicks from a guy this size supposed to be this hard. I didn't know he was showing me how to hold bags. I'm like, this is, I can only imagine if I didn't have the bags on my arm. So I start at, John Jackson was a bag one bag in his Jujitsu school and it was filled. The class was filled with guys that were black belt in karate. They were trying to add Jujitsu to their system. We had a bunch of black belts. So I wanted to know if, if maybe this was just normal, maybe all dudes can it like, so I would say I would have guys that go, Dave, can you kick the bag right here due to the coach on the crowd.

Speaker 2:          00:43:09       So he would kick in. I go, Joe, now you kick it. And then everyone goes, oh shut. And then we're like, oh my God, it is incredible. So then I kept doing that over and over. I wanted to just make sure, just to make sure I was telling him I knew what I was talking about. So I remember commentating for King of the cage and Rico Rodriguez was uh, uh, backstage and we were hanging out and he was the only one I saw. They would throw turning sidekicks and I felt Joe's turning side kick. He was, he's right away. He was showing me how powerful it can be. And I remember taking a video of Joe doing turning side kicks in his old house and the garage showing it backstage at Kink to Ricoh Roderick is, there was no youtube or anything. I'm like, look dude, you got to take lessons from Joe Rogan.

Speaker 2:          00:43:50       You've got to throw it. And He, I remember him looking at the screening, you couldn't really tell on that little, it was a little LCD screen from my blog video camera, my video camera. And he was like, hmm, I'm trying to show him there's no technology in 2000 at all. I had to show him what the LCD screen and he was like, interesting, interesting. And you know, and he was, he thought I was crazy. The guy fear factor, can it, can I watch that Instagram video? I showed probably 50 people that you know who can kick like a fucking mule and I would beg him to kick. I would beg him to kick Shankar Carwyn. I said, when you fight Brock Lesnar, throw this fucking kick. Well he's just in that weird way.

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       He's like, everything is too big. His shoulders are too big. His hands are too big. He walked into fucking um, uh, the boulder Jujitsu school. He walked him all eastern spices and I swear to God, it took me a half a second to realize it was Shane Carwyn cause I thought it was watching like a movie. I thought it was watching a movie. We're like, like the thing shows up. He's, he was practicing kicks and we kept telling we got to use them. You've got to use them. This is right before I went in the tough house. This motherfucker's, I start using them for my, tore my MCL the week before I went to the ultimate fighter house. So I went in the house with a torn MCL. He kicked in once. I said no more. You fucking imagine if you look at how big his hands are, if you see how hard the punching power is going to directly translate to kicking power, freaky punching power, he's going to have freaky kicking power.

Speaker 3:          00:45:25       Almost always. It's just a matter of his, has he put in the same amount of time? Oh Wow. This chap got of, got hung in there, man. Yeah, he's got this dude, this is just trying to his back. If he chokes him out, this would be incredible. Betty, how funny is it that almost everybody goes with the body triangle now when they take the back? Isn't it funny though that she used to be a thing to say that all the time? Never going to disagree with Eddie Bravo ever. I'm just saying for my game personally in, in MMA, I'm not a fan of that body triangle y flexibility. So no, I can do it. I can do it. Why aren't you a fan? I just feel like, um, especially guys are so good at defending a blue belt in the UFC with those big gloves can defend forever.

Speaker 3:          00:46:06       So it's almost a stalling technique. Now if you forget, unless you're just a Henry Gracie, Gracie, Eddie Bravo, fuck Verdo fucking nasty on someone's back. You gotta move, you gotta move. Got Trend just from the arm bar. You got a transistor site control from it. I ain't no problems with that. I'm not disagreeing. I wouldn't disagree with that. I was going for the kill on the back. I would definitely put the body triangle and I would, but if I wasn't, if I was thinking he's too fresh as in MMA, it seems like if you get the guys back and he's fresh, Tuft finishment the our transition to spiderweb, the arm bar position, I would go right to that. Just would Rhonda. Rhonda don't mess around with the back. But if you get someone's back late and they're kind of tired and hurt, that's when you make a choking because guys are, it's hard with the gloves.

Speaker 3:          00:46:54       Like you said, they grabbed the glove though. If you notice it and you're not allowed to, but they grabbed the clubs so it's super tough. Then it's tough to slow to sneak the hand in around the neck because because of the cloud. Do you think that there could be an argument because the fact that they're not fighting with anything on their feet and they're kicking each other in the face, like why aren't they punching each other in the face with no gloves on? The reality being that if you did punch incorrectly and if you were more wild and reckless with your punches, you would have to pay a price for it. So we're really more protecting hands than we've run our the fighter. And in fact

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       it's probably better for your brain if you're getting bare knuckled. If you're not allowed to tape your wrists up and you're not allowed to put anything on your hands. I'm sorry. You just can't hit as hard. You just can't. You're going to have some movement. You're going to have some movement in your wrists when you punch, you can have a lot of movement with your kicks. You don't want to be fucking movement. You're shinning people in the head. There's no movement and thicker, denser and like, like Terry Adam, when Edson Barboza wheel kicked him Gibbs. No movement in your fucking he'll man. None. So that the amount of impact that you can make with a heel like that, like you're saying, you're saying people should maybe wear pads on their feet. The hands. No, I'm not saying get rid of the gloves, the gloves. I think there's an argument for getting rid of the glare.

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       Why? There's not mainstream media. Right? What'd you be like? What fucking morons? It's a four ounce glove. It doesn't do much. It's just perception. I think the PR, I think honestly it probably protects the hand more than it protects anything. I think Bella tour for liking the hand. Bella toward gloves. They have a good idea cause it's more curved and it's, it's more padded and it protects the hand. Would there be patting your back of the hand? Why do they have patty? Can I get back fist? This dude's you could spinning back. Jesus. There should just be pads on the knuckles. Not on the back of the hand. That big thick thing. It's harder to give you a bunch out. It's true. But the but the belt or glove. The reason why it's so fat like that. The idea being that this, it's everlasting. He gave it to the Japanese guy, pat.

Speaker 4:          00:48:57       Whoa. Maybe he won that second round. I Dunno. We didn't. We were really barely paring it down to that first round. Should have been dead. I hate, there's no way this should have been a draw. I think what I was saying is the belt or glove it supports and there's still four ounce. They're still friends but there's more, there's more support because it's more, you had hated even more Eddie cause there's like more stuff on top. It's like thicker on top. And the idea being, I think that's what she said. Oh Shit. Brian at chop. I think they um, they found that they had way less handbrakes though. Once they started using it, they had a bunch of hand to balance for gloves. Yeah. They're a, they protect that significant because the handbrake and keep you out of there, take you out for he cans.

Speaker 4:          00:49:37       Right, right. But Eddie, do you see my argument or my not, it's not even an argument. I'm not married to it. I'd be happy if they kept fighting with UFC gloves. But I think there can be a debate that it would probably be just as safe with no gloves and probably maybe even possibly safer and way better for grappling. Have there been less pokes to the eye or more or has it been like a steady amount happens all the time. Yeah. I would say with no gloves if it's easier to knock a guy out, good for the show, good for the sport. If it's easier to get submissions because you don't have all that shit that's good for the show, it would. If it adds chaos and add submissions, get rid of them.

Speaker 4:          00:50:21       I think that um, if, uh, I think if you have gloves on, you probably can kale people better. I really do. I think you have way more protection on your wrist. That's a big thing. You're hands are wrapped up. You feel real confident with it. It's nice and tight. Yeah. Anything to get more knockouts and more submissions. That's what we want to see. We don't, we're not paying for decisions. Yeah. I mean, and also it's like how much, how much work is getting done. I mean, how much work is getting done with those fucking gloves on? Spend a lot of time wrapping the hands for what really again? Yeah. Got To protect those hands, man. Those hands are precious. Yeah. I mean think about like the cheekbones killer murderer sockets. That's it. This kind of weird, right? Why won't they pat up the eye socket have like, well this is all, I think it's all remanence of boxing.

Speaker 4:          00:51:09       You know, I think we have like a lot of ideas and and we, we have their scoring system. We told we don't have our own scoring system. Our scoring system is based entirely on the boxing's corns to the 10 point must system. We just arbitrarily started using 10 point must cause the athletic commissions had already prepared for it. They already had judges that knew how to score a 10 for the winter nine for the loser. If it's bad round, he scored an Nate. I mean this is a way different game than boxing. It needs its own type of fighting. Super Score. I know we don't, you think that we need a more complex scoring system when we work together with Eddie Bravo used to do the in round scoring at the UFC and it was fucking great because Eddie had a sister. She'll unofficial judge, unofficial in round score the hell.

Speaker 4:          00:51:55       So he would sit next to us. It was sitting next to us. Then in between rounds we would, you know, would show a highlight or something and then I'd say, Eddie, what do you think? And Eddie would say, you know, I gave it to this, to this, I think for doomed did that and blah blah blah. And he would break down why and he had a sheet and on his sheet who would write kicks on one side take downs on their side submissions on the other side. And he would write like what type of submission, how close it was. And he had all that stuff laid out and then afterwards he would give a detailed reason why I thought that Kane won that round because of this. And then he would go over all the various, write it down. It's so hard. I didn't write it down.

Speaker 4:          00:52:29       There's so much that went on in that round you, it's hard to visually see if he was a question. If somebody takes, if somebody attempts 10 takedowns and the guy stuff's 10 takedowns, the aggressor is more valuable, but then he gets one. You know that you don't let a question. What about wins around for sure. He's winning the round. If he's attempting more, right. The guys stuffing it. That guy is, he's not giving up two months. So aggression, aggression should count as sure. Yeah, it'd be something. What about a foma submission artist? I pulled, I pulled half guard and I'm throwing all these submission tents, all these Amish temps and the guys kind of getting out of them. I'm getting, I'm going to give nothing but judges see the guy on top. He's getting the true, but I see that again, that say that again. A Guy's trying to sell it. So let's say you and I are fighting. You pull guard and you're throne Ooma Plata triangle, a armbars nonstop per five minutes, nonstop moms.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       The whole time on defending, I win the round. That ain't right. That ain't right. But, and you're doing and I'm doing no damage, but let's say, let's say in that Ben Saunders fight, let's say that exact same thing happened every round. He ended up taking him down and just assaulted him with those elbows and rubber guard. But he didn't finish him. I think when it's that clear, the judges will give it to the guy on the bottom. Cause it has happened before. It just needs to be, you know what? Clear with some serious that's up for debate. You would think they would. I bet it'd be 50, 50 depending where you're fine. They shit, I'll fucking crazy. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. Cause uh, thinking I think if the NFL, NBA where like that where it's 50, 50 pence on, don't leave it up to the judges. It's a, Ben Saunders didn't get the Alma plot that the guy survived and the time run out.

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       Who would I won that round? You think the judges would have really gave it to the dude on top? Probably. He was the whole time. I know, but all they do is they just, a lot of them are just mentally geared towards, he's on top. He's winning the round cause they're on educated with Jujitsu. You know what ends up happening? I'll tell you some of these judges, man, they look at the replays and if in the truck they're showing [inaudible] doing all that stuff they've got, okay, they must in the truck think that due to winning. So they do that. They do that for 100% for sure. 100% for sure. 100% not all of them. Not all the judges. Not all the judges and a few, but I know what's happened. This is the fight. I'm looking. Brendan Schaub is a weird fascination with this. I know.

Speaker 2:          00:55:04       I don't think it's about fighting. I'm going to just choosing the young lady. She looks, look at [inaudible] her picked her up for the UFC thick shoes like a little Paula Hardy's looking at, I think Michigan is very attractive. Marion was attractive female. She doesn't do steroids. No Way. Oh look at that Japanese book. Look. So, so tell me she's a cutie pie. No. First of all, Rin grew up doing gymnastics. Judo, she, she takes, she trains every day. Takes only one day off a month, 24 hours a day. She has that fricking crazy workouts. He's undefeated to look at those arms. Come on. She's undefeated, undefeated 16 and no one. Look, there's no Joe. She, she's asking right now. I'm a huge Pratt. All of us. I hope. I hope she's awesome. She doesn't get smoke. Well, what is that thing that she does? Weird cheered photographs that she does. She does like me. I'm awesome. Sexy pictures. I'm not saying it's bad. It's called marketing. It's called marketing. You mean the awesome. I'm just saying it was your mom. I would say it's odd. Are you going to a store? Brian is

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       in my car. It's weird. You have one store in your car if you're a pony to another party. Right. Travis Browne, Travis Brown water to fight you in a rash guard and the commission, you know, since they're allowing girls that fighting rash guards, they decide, Ooh, let's make it, uh, you know, it's up. Leave it up to the fighters. Would you allow if it was up to you, would you allow Travis Browne to where rash guard and you're fine? No. Why not? Because, uh, girls wear them all the time. It's true. Why would you say no or would you say whenever he wants it doesn't matter. What would you say? I would probably say no because if he wants to wear it, there's some sort of advantage that he thinks that he's going to have by wearing it. So he must be Hella comfortable in this rash guard.

Speaker 3:          00:57:10       If I pull the power moon, I'm like Nah son, take that rash geared off cause I'm not wearing one. You know what I'm saying? Friendly, sharp playing mind games. But you can't, you and you'd think, hey look, look what could be the advantage. I don't know. You're nasty and a rash guard. What are you talking about? Nasty look, look at this. No behind you. Brendan Chop. Did she shout? Whoa. Look at those legs. There's all the photographs of her but on her son, her arms man cause too much. As long as much I know a little much. No. No. Because I think she would be kind of submissive. It'd be Kinda hot cause she's like the super strong kind of advantage. Do you show that you would have probably a group, maybe a grip advantage. How, how, how would he get him? Because let, let's say, uh, you're fighting a guy like for breach over doom.

Speaker 3:          00:57:58       Who you're, you're worried about is you're going to get a really good sweat and warm up on before. So I'm a little more slippery, you know what I'm saying? You want to be slipper? Yes. Oh I see. So you think that it would be an advantage cause it, you would, it would limit Dior defense? Yes. Especially with a guy like for doom, right. That's what I'm saying. Well you're dealing with us. So what she's wearing, what of Travis Brown wanted to wear that you would object to it. Yeah. It's slapped him the face at the press garments slap in the face for even considering it. What if the guy you were fighting, okay. What if the guy, you were filed Jon Jones Gacy what does the guy you were fighting? Uh, let's see. Who could it be? Did it help him? If he wants to wear a mask, you were guiding lactose.

Speaker 3:          00:58:39       Carlos wore that in pride. I'm down for that. It would, if you were fighting cro cop and he wanted to wear a rash guard, would you allow him think about it? He was not going to try to submit you. I know, but I kept saying you would want to submit but I kept taking, I fought cro gun. Oh wait, that's right. You beat him. Right. I forget. I forget. Yeah. And not only that, that was a panic. So that would be a bad example because a kickboxer would want to be, have a really good guard like you would want him to and he wants to get up. But if he, you're on the bottom, how is that going to help people with extra grip holding a guy onto, you know, it be just try to get stood up two bottles or loss gain. Cro Cop did the same. So you, uh, so you would be against that if they, if you had a

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       sign, a petition against, are you for or against rash guards in MMA? Men don't care that much. But if you were a rash guard on when we're wrestling shoes take in the face wrestling shoes. What if you were going up against a guy like Paul Harris then? No, no wrestling shoes. No recipe boil these things. Yeah, we're a little leg locks illegal. I want to see the dude's name, but I know a dude who would lay in a mineral bath. He would take mineral oil and lay in the bath the night before and then he would take a shower and dry off and then he would make weight. Even though he was, he was not wearing any oil on him. He was so oily from the night before. But as soon as you broke a sweat, it would all come through his pores and he would just be like a seal.

Speaker 1:          01:00:10       Just us seal does heal. Do you think you could beat in an MMA fight? Do you think you could be Gabby Garcia? Are you being, you being Farrell's? Yeah. Yeah. You're talking to a man, Garcia. I know it doesn't match and then pushes images. She lost weight. She got to slim 300 pounds real quick. I like it. He should take, I think she's very attractive. However, written the Chi. Yes. Britain. The Chi. I just feel like she keeps, and it's going to be good for the sport. Could you imagine if she became the well to which are the bantamweight champion? I've written to Chi if she's got all these freak pictures of her in her underwear, you know, wearing fucking little fucking bunny rabbit slippers and shit. Dangerous fight.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       Dangerous fight for me. She's 10. She doesn't know what to expect, but she could be sent us a little bull dog. What did she do? Her up. This Japanese bulldog. It doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't know what she's doing. She's gonna try getting her down. Oh, she does know what she's doing. She's, come on, she's stiff, but she could still land man. But she looked very stiff nerves. You've got first UFC fight. Fuck yeah. USC. No, I bet she's real strong. Dude. Me Tastes gonna fuck her up. Meisha Tate's later turn into the mic. Aggressive. How long has Ron show business? My math is wrong with you. He wants to be on that Mike. So bad. I got hungry. Starving when he's eating, he can't push it away. That's my friend.

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       It looks like me. She was going to dominate it does me just said, oh you train everyday stuff for one. Check this out me. She looks very strong and very aggressive and you know there's another thing that she's coming off of a fight where she wasn't. Oh Wow. Bragged on Michelle's digit. Pretty solid. Yeah. Well her overall technique is very solid. I mean she's the only person to ever put Rhonda in a compromising position in a fight. Let's call this Carmouche. That's true. That's true. But that was when used, she still does. She does that hip toss where she grabs a hold the headlock, the headlock and she gives up the back all the time cause she wasn't trained with a cage so she wouldn't eat. She wasn't used to it and got in a weird position. I just feel like she's so confident that it doesn't, she feels like it doesn't matter if they get her neck or whatever, she's going to fuck them up.

Speaker 1:          01:02:37       That girl has such incredible like laser beam focus towards victory does. She doesn't have any doubt. It's, it's so rare that Beth career batch Cocheco hair, that's going to be a great, that can actually happen. And then the next one, she's got Rhonda. So, uh, work pissed off. She, she looks like a giant stuff. We'll compare to this check written to Chi. Well, Nikai is very thick, but it doesn't seem to be working out. Reney Chi. Better figure something out here. Not that impressed. I gotta be honest. Well, she's very stiff. I mean she is still when anything can happen, fights or she went with a submission. You never know, man. You never know. She's not going to win striking unless she just has some, oh, she got tagged with that knee. Just lighten her own. Now. Ameesha looks very smooth. Yes, she does. Close to taking her down. Oh, but I'm telling you, do weird things happen when people are durable. And this chick seems very durable. I'm not saying she's going to win the fight, but weird shifts can happen.

Speaker 1:          01:03:40       Yes, he's written. It guides me like, Holy Shit, I'm a use of sin. That's what she's thinking right now. Oh Shit. I'm in the UFC. Well, this, by the way, this is like one of the best versions of Meesha we've ever seen, if not the best. You don't think it's a she's facing. I'm sure it has something to do with it. No, but seriously, she looks very good shopping. Nice. No, he's being honest. I'm being dead on dead on. It's like when Overeem fight Frank Mir, Frank Mir fan in the world, everyone's like, oh my God, they'll redeem his back. Or was he fighting a human punching bag? Frank Meir did nothing. Well, Frank's had a long career, man. Danny, you got car I left, got hit by a car. It was on a motorcycle and the car literally hit his leg. The car slammed into his leg, but he's saying he still a great fights after fights.

Speaker 1:          01:04:31       He had good fights after that. Brock Lesnar, it took him a long time to recover. It took them a long time to recover. I think that, um, that was a devastating injury, frankly, one of the best ever to do it. Ever without a doubt. When the best submission artists without a, she's hurt. She's hurt. She's really hard. It's over. Oh boy. Nisha just chicks durable man. Very durable. The sport needs Misha Women's, women's fighting needs. Misha Tate, Bob Brennan show magic. I'm telling you, cause she's attractive. She speaks well and she has some skills. Yeah. Oh, she definitely has some scales down. Shit. She got to, you know what is a chick like Nisha though? Like what does she do with a girl like Rhonda out there that is kind of a prophecy to Stacy second. Koizumi

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       second place. Second place. Second place. Isn't that bad. It's like shake and bake. It's shaken baby. Shake your shake it. Rhonda shake. I mean she was big, big. Hey Becky still lived in a nice crib. Bake. Still had a nice brim. Big wound up fucking shakes. Wife remember shit got crazy. Shit gets crazy. Crazy. Oh Marty. That was what calls him up. He goes, why is the TV on? What you want the TV on the legal on the same time because I liked to party. How do you get the sound stereo but still watching the TV.

Speaker 3:          01:05:55       That's such a good movie. Great shake and bake. But nobody, I'm telling you man, they're not good friends. Look at my face and to always be little Zur. No, they fucking hate each other. So No, I'm just saying shaking baby. Yeah, but being second place to someone as ruthless as Rhonda, like when they were doing the ultimate fighter together and they were doing that thing where they're climbing the wall and Rhonda winds and she goes, fuck you bitch. Hey, she fucking hates her. Nobody does that. Everybody else if is Gilbert and didn't guys don't do that guys. Brian is a different animal man. She absolutely does. Does she literally has hate in her heart? Oh yeah. I don't hate anyone in the UFC. I don't hate anyone. No one Rhonda literally hates me. Should tailor hates she's on. She's on some next level shit. She done some demonic next level.

Speaker 3:          01:06:40       She's got some fury in her and, and you don't want to be Misha Tate on the receiving end. Well you need to be not only if you do need to match her skillset, which is good fucking luck, but you need to be able to match that intensity man. Fuck thing. He's really fucked as this written Nikai okay. She's fucking like, cause we're talking about Rhonda right now. This girl's only half ass double leg. She's freaking, I don't know what she's doing. Turned on her. I was planning out our kids and say no, not with head movement like that. No. Oh excuse me sir. She doesn't come on. Get this and Brennan my like you more. She's checking the oil. You don't, she doesn't have any oil in there. [inaudible] was knuckle deep in that Knuckle d women. It's not an oil situation. The knuckle deep meter hits Red Hot Friday night. Taylor with a knee lube made from real butter oil. Well it fits if you're, if a guy has oil, does a gal have oil as well? If we're not checking your oil, checking your honey, checking your honeypot, come on. Sympathetic conversation. Checking the Koolaid. Let's not do this because this is bad for the sport. I get answers path, man. I was trying to stay out of it with you guys directly.

Speaker 4:          01:08:21       Faults. It's none of our faults. We had been drinking and we're not responsible for our word, correct? No, I am. No, I'm just drinking coffee. I'm sober as shit, but things like that. It's like getting kicked in the junk. I don't ever know what to say. If a girl kicks a girl, I'm not coming up.

Speaker 3:          01:08:34       They showed me. How have they stopped? No. What about this? What about going to Haiti? Shot hurt. Are you going to show it in slow motion? You show the ball shots in slow motion is my point and everyone goes, oh, the whole stadium go home.

Speaker 4:          01:08:49       By the way, I joke about it sometimes, you know I'll make light of it like no, that is not fun. You all say something like that, but I'm not going to say that if it's a girl punt a you said,

Speaker 3:          01:09:01       excuse me. [inaudible] is on her back that up

Speaker 4:          01:09:08       throw. What did I tell you? Man Opens when people are durable.

Speaker 3:          01:09:14       This little fire hydrant, just keep talking. Keep [inaudible] get this. We'd give you big brown, but listen Jeezy don't win one and get the breath. Let's see if she holds the back body triangle. But no, look, she's hanging on man. She's kind of hanging out with, she's going to be in her garage guard. Well, let's see what kind of guard she's got. Maybe she's, she might have some NASA. Well, me, she's a very good grappler. Yeah, she's a better graph within. She's a strike. 100% oh man. It's, but you're right guys. Hey guys.

Speaker 4:          01:10:01       Durable Little Gal. She's game. Yep. Taking shots. Yeah, but now she's got me. Y'all talk for dropping bow Chihuahua. She's trying to set up an arm bar. Look at this. She's good. She's got good hips, man. Active hips. This is a tricky situation for me. Misha. She better be careful. Oh, this chick's legit. Legit off her back. But Misha, good defense. All Straw on top. It comes to Nissan. Oh, attempt there. The more she can slow Meesha down on it, the more she turns into a grappling match. She got some good positions, man. I mean, she didn't come close to finish. She's winning this round right now. You're in Japan to remember the last part was,

Speaker 4:          01:10:52       I wonder if they're using Japanese judge. I got a text from Dana saying that in the fight that we were talking shit during the whole fight, the referee go grab the guy's glove. I don't know what the situation was because we were just laughing and having too much fun. We missed, we missed if he's listening to it. Yeah. Yeah. Dana was going crazy and he texted me and he's like, I'm sure you know that. If I saw it, I would have called it. But I told him in the text message, I go, did, we didn't even see it. We were talking so much shit. This is the worst way to watch a fight ever.

Speaker 3:          01:11:25       I don't know that we've gone some weird tangent, barely paying attention to amazing fight, but it's so fun. This is my favorite way to watch my timber loan. The guys got that single,

Speaker 4:          01:11:37       oh boy. We were doing this, uh, this my comment, oh boy. We were doing this video breakdown of Bryan caraway the other day and it's funny, Bryan caraway on his, on his resume like they have, you know your resume, like the fighters resume they gave me like fought in Strikeforce. Funnily Dixie, 13 four records.

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       Hey said boyfriend of me. She said girlfriend, Misha Tate. It said boyfriend of mishit tape that was in his bio and he's a good fighter. He's foreign one in the UFC. He's a very good fighter. He's beaten some very good guys. It's just his girlfriend is hot and they want the logon. No saved his mom's

Speaker 4:          01:12:20       she went into, she had had an asthmatic attack and me's in like Shimmy. She saved her life. Wow. Yup. Meets your say save. Whose life his or her mother Bryan Caraway. Oh, look at this. This is what she went for. She went for a Tampon to got her back. Hmm. Damn. I like it. There's something right there. Do you see something right there? What do you see right there? What do I see where here she was just completely on the side arm. Triangle position. You know what I love Eddie? Tell me about this. Are you doing that arm bar where the arms in that arm bolt where everybody's doing it now? Like a lot of guys are doing an MMA with the arms trapped inside the legs. Like um, like the pass the arm to the side from side control. You said Pat, the arm gets passed to the side. It's like this. Yeah. Yeah. It's totally stretched out and then the guillotine goes on over it. You know what I'm talking about? I don't know. Anytime. A lot of guys have been doing it where they're getting the arm. I'm completely pinned up to the side he gets,

Speaker 3:          01:13:18       I think this is one. I think this is one to one grab real quick. I think this is one

Speaker 4:          01:13:24       one. I'm just going to throw that out there. You guys. Um, have you seen Brian couns wig? A wheel kick.

Speaker 3:          01:13:29       Beautiful. Oh, back again. She likes jumping on bags. That was a good little combo. She turned it on Japanese bulldog. That looks like a very shiny outfit, man. Mischa's clean today. Kimora attempts here. This chick is so strong, man. Look at. Oh, she comes and she's jumping on the back. Really Quick Hook once side. That means you're right. She's telling you. What did I tell you, boy? Right there. You got instincts. I've been doing this a while. Netflix, you're out the Japanese bulldog show you rooting against Tate now, bro,

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       me or Brian, any one of us. Does anybody here? No, I love him. He should take. Okay. If you could choose to be a tropic island with one of them free. She taped me. Go do this to me. Don't do this to me. Don't do it. You, you. You have a thing with the Japanese chick. You would have, I think the party came. She is a cutie pie. She's on that brand and you can handle it. They're, they're both of area track. Who Lie? You find her jacket? Both of them. Well, let's just, let's admired them for their skill. The traffic because their skills are, oh me, she's out, but she's struggling, man. Oh, elbow. Big issue. It's a little tiny chairs. Top angry man. I thought she looked a little annoyed. That whole Combo or she that takes down to the back. That was really smooth.

Speaker 4:          01:15:00       How was much more difficult? Is it for my beautiful girls? Tired. How much more difficult is it for a beautiful girl fight? Oh, big yawn. A lot more pressure. Well, I met this girl the other day who said she wants to get into fighting shoes. She was stunning and I went, why would you do saying like a girl like Misha, she has a beautiful face, whereas like body to go Vandelay Silva and I mean everything. She's beautiful. She's a great person too. Very nice. Very smart too. But let's think about like Vendelay Silva is also a mixed martial arts fighter now. I've been a fan of Andrew Lee silver from the Golden Day. Tired today, retired today. His face has changed so much from impacts and scar tissue and damage. And we remember like when he fought like Dan Henderson, he had this one, he was actually handsome guy. He had this one look and then over the years of just getting smashed, his nose completely flooded out.

Speaker 4:          01:15:54       And then he had to get an operation to open his nose passage up. He had zero like May and Miller's the same way. Man can't breathe out of his nose. His mate is, no, just doesn't work. It's just smashed from now. A girl like me should take. It was my point. She is in the same sport. It's them. It's very possible that I can hit like a man though. She would've. She fought that batchko hair. She'd get hit, but she was kissing God. I'll catch and eat cheese. That's true. She had a blow to the elbow, but an average Wanderlei Silva was going against a cro cop. These monsters just can break your nose. It's true. It's a little different. Good point. That's a good point, but still, you're a girl still scholar. My daughter fight, like look at this scar on. Let's think of a big scar that happened in MMA.

Speaker 4:          01:16:41       Okay. Like Joe Lozan. He's got this big scar that he had. He had that gate, that Graston method. From what? From a knee, I believe it was a knee or a kick from one of his fights. What to grass. The method. They take like a piece of metal and talk about breaking up the scar tissue. These are for injuries. Athletes use it for, it's like a high tech form of that rolfing stuff. It's like breaking down, which we've ever done. Roffman yes, fucking painful. It's painful but it could affect, it leaves a mark for forever. You're fucked. You're

Speaker 3:          01:17:09       saying, you're saying the girl like Ronda Rousey's Rumi state who has a really pretty face. Yeah man. They could get a giant like fucking gash across their face. Like we haven't seen that yet, but how weird is it going to be when there's a chick that has like, like John John, John Jack has that cut from fighting frank Trigg. He was shooting in for a take down. He got caught with a knee and he has, I mean he had perfect surgery done on it. Like you can't pay attention, but John Jack is a manly man. If he has a scar, it doesn't hurt. The way you look, makes it more hit some really important girl. You're, Ooh girl, a girl with a four inch scar, a scarlet letter face because it's not going to change much. Guys are so horny as single leg. Is that, well actually even bigger like Gina Carano though, man.

Speaker 3:          01:17:53       That face a guy that you see whether it's happening. Does that count as a point when she takes her down against Toronto had a toy like a boxing match, but I'm saying that that should be scored right when you take somebody down and single accounts up, but it depends on the judge to take somebody down. Somebody stands right up. Take a little pride, a little thing there, man. Damn. Oh, I bet you they'd give it to a Rin Raisie really? They might two rounds, right? He's a superstar too. She got the back twice. Ultimate fighter. How they have to two rounds and a third. If they go a third, the third decides that. That's a great idea. Don't take the bad idea. They used to do that in k one, two. I think that's a good idea because it eliminates that Misha is disappointed. Those fights where you have three rounds.

Speaker 3:          01:18:48       The first two are kind of close, but the judges gave it to like the same dude and then the third round the other guy beat his ass and he still loses. It's true. You know? It was weird though in the tough house when I was on it. When you go to round them like you wouldn't know, you go back to court. I'm like, we're gone a third like Jesus man. You know? I think it's, it's easier to beg for that way. I agree. It's kind of cool to know. You know what I would do if I would, if they were a brown one went by and it was like uneventful could have went either way. I would just not even score that rally. He would wait till the next round. If we add another round like that, I would give him one piece. I agree.

Speaker 3:          01:19:24       And then you know what I mean? Why would you automatically, I give someone around when it could've went either way and maybe she didn't give it to man. I don't know. We were talking so much sugar in. It could be the worst judges of, I don't even know who the guys were. Four judges. They're going to give it to the car. Oh Shit. Let's see, man, I'm a seasoned here. Foods there, any booze? They don't even respect the warriors chair fights in Japan is awesome, man, because while the fights are going on, everyone's dead quiet. It's really cool. She going to call out Rhonda here. She needs to go to a and work on our striking, powerful Brian Stann looking slick.

Speaker 5:          01:20:12       Got That bug

Speaker 3:          01:20:15       look. It's not my favorite sexy accent, but goddamn Japanese is pretty hot. Something about it. My top stomp my feet. I thought then uniquely sexy about it. Really. The English accent. Well, Spanish is pretty hard to actually, let's say you're Mexican modern family chick, that Cuban chair. Oh Jesus. It's impossible to get hotter kids with her. They called me. I get hot to do it right. They need to do an episode one, like how did he get hurt? They need a rewind. Go back. Who got her like, how did they, where did they pull that off? Maybe he's richest shit and she's a fricking, maybe he'll get a dick like Donald Cerrone's arm. So big. The black belt in Jujitsu. Not, not giant, not like she's just like a fucking strong 155 pounders lead. Exactly. 155 pounder. Who throws hard with not aggressive attitudes? Would they be online or just pulls it out?

Speaker 3:          01:21:28       She just pulls it out like it's a fucking fighting a fire. It's holds it out by just saying, my index finger think she is fighting a fire. It's hip, not a big old angry piss hole. Like a fucking one of those snake fish. They can crawl out of a lake and walk for a mile. That's what I look. So you can see with a cock flares out in the mushroom head, it's got guilt limey. It's always slimy. Always just in the middle of the desert. He pulls it out as Dick. Alissa has a runny nose, runny nose, Harry Salmonella, like aliens tongue. Remember when the alien pulls, timeouts everything drips, looks like tomato, red veins and the length and if I'm not around, he has been out for a long time. Brought brought two years. Jamie pullout Amir's the dollars record. He's been out there two years for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:22:38       Wow. He was a really good fighter and then he fought Ludwig and Ludwig kind of picked him apart and that was like, that was a big loss with broke, broken Ludwig Glue really lit him up because he was really becoming a very good striker, very high volume. He was into that Moy Thai style. But there's certain guys, other guys were they, when they begin their career and they face the guy where they can't do anything and they never, they never come back from it. Well it was, it's weird, right? Was the style matchup. He had lost a recipes

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       before it came back stronger, but Duane Ludwig when he's on, was one of the most technical, most proficient in most educated strikers in MMA ever. Ever, ever. He's so educated, which is why Korea on both sides of his life in such a good trainer, the reason why he's such a good trainer is because he's so educated in tall tactics. [inaudible] he's been there. That tells trainers habit. When we were working out with him, man, I saw him correcting all these little things with you. And all I can think of is, God damn, if Shab could work with this guy every day, if you could work with Dwayne every day, it would change your game a lot. You're a sponge and when you're with that guy and he's showing you stuff and he's a freak. I love sponge in a freak. He's trying to just fill you up and you're like, come on, show me what you got.

Speaker 4:          01:23:52       And you guys were, that was a fun workout session to watch. Oh so much fun. But that fight was just a bad fight for Amir was the wrong style. Dwayne was too, God damn good on his feet and Dwayne came into that fight, healthy, you know, there was like that was always Dwayne's things you is cut too much weight. He's never healthy. Too hard. He's been fighting for so long and kickboxing and fucking, you know, it finally caught up to him when he got to the UFC and Dwayne's the guy where he came in. Now you're talking superstar with his skillset and his work ethic is just, he was a little too late, you know what I'm saying? Honestly, coachings worked out for him with tremendously, I'm just saying, you fell. You fast forward and start Dwayne 10 years later. He's a superstar when he does his work ethic.

Speaker 4:          01:24:35       Dwayne is not genetically gifted. He's got a a regular athletic body. It's his intelligence and his knowledge and his drive demeanor, demeanor's demeanor. Listen, when we'd come to the gym and they're sparring, Dwayne be the first one. The cage means Shane. We look at each other like, I ain't going with them. You Go, is that my ankle? When you go argue, good to go first with them. He would walk through everything. Keep going. Wow. Why kickstand. Yeah. He was a fantastic strike with heavyweights, with God, and he talks to us like, you better not. Don't take me down. Don't be a bitch and take me down. And we, I'd like, okay, but I'm going to take the hit now. So I'm sitting there striking with this to him. What are you thinking about care? Are you practicing turning sidekicks or wheel kicks? A not Wilcox yellow.

Speaker 4:          01:25:19       Can we listen to his music please wait. Comes up to the Sopranos Music. Brian. It's boring. So you've actually taken it. No. Turn inside, man. That would be a good fucking idea. He's right here. He's your boy. We did a little kicking something. I'm coming to think about hardy. I'm telling you this. I'm telling you he's got it. We got some stuff. I believe you. We have the, I will have the best stirring up the Malik guys I'm bringing to Mimic Travis Browne. I'm telling you, we got it. You'll be just fine. We'll working on dealing with that front snap kick. He does. Well, the biggest, fight them on that too. The Jackson's camp. They're really the hidden that Jackson's anymore though, but he's still going to train there.

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       He's trying to, he's not just, he's doing the whole camp in Glendale. Okay. Ron Does camp well. Look, he learned, still learned a lot from 100% still like still going to have that cheat. Just Christ. How jacked his doctor Yama looked at one 17 bodied up. We call her [inaudible]. He said 1111 when we got to make a new meter. He certainly isn't all that GSP liquor. A little pudgy. He does and he's got a beautiful, he goes, nobody does. That's kind of impossible. No bullshit. He is fucking unbelievable. Shred old trunk. Did you see Captain America? He did a good job. Oh fuck yeah, he did. Yeah. He's got a a martial arts killer. What do you think it would have fucking greatest welterweight of all time was also good at playing the kids shredded. Look at Akiyama. He's doing very well where you get what he's saying.

Speaker 3:          01:26:58       He had one 80 feet. Practice singing. You have to, your body has to be in very good shape. I think he's getting a couple of fights at one 70 if not, this might be his day. What's usually five one 85 you'll see the fight with Lieben leaving like you didn't see one of the greatest fights ever as far as entertainment value, entertainment, entertainment for those last chip, is that what it is? Judo. That's a famous singer and he's a famous Japanese 35. Do you think he's, do you think he's uh, the married, I'm not, I'm going to be faithful. A celebrity or do you think he just running shit, running stuff trains on Japanese women. They did some weird shit up shit on each other.

Speaker 3:          01:27:56       I'm not saying, I'm not saying he doesn't too far, man. You mean when they wrap Saran wrap and they just, then they breathe out? Shouty is podcasts all shouting past 2:00 AM 2:00 AM and we're lit up like Christmas trees? No, I'm only drinking coffee. I'm drinking. But when you do wrap your face and Saran wrap bottom of his lats, the line, he doesn't have a lower back. By the way. I got a nice back. It's hard for me to give it up. He's got a beautiful back. It's shoot us the same, but he looks, he's so, he was always like a very fit, fit guy. But at one 70 he looks like a fucking alien. Wow. He's shredded. Look at him boyfriend and I'm going to start bowing before my fights. Wait a minute. It says boyfriend on his banner. I hope so. Yeah, that's his girl probably right there.

Speaker 3:          01:28:44       This is people said, oh, Amir suddenly took two years off. Hey, we got one flight at the dime piece has taken some time off to Diane pieces. Busy making bank saying singing, painting, Hungry Day. I agree. That body keeps you hungry. Here's a dollar doing for a living these days. He hasn't fought in two years. He's been teaching lots of the year. Come on. Who has better last? Pretty bouncy and who has better lat Amir's movement was always good, man. It was just Dwayne was just a step ahead of him in that fight and drain. Heard them with like a left hook, I think. Left Hook. Yeah. There's never been known for his power. I feel like Akiyama is gonna have some power. Yeah, that is true. Akiyama to has some ball. That's a big wakeup. Come on. Seriously from the beginning. I've never wore power. My just stoned out of my mind.

Speaker 3:          01:29:31       Oh No. He's very big lats and he has a chin to Akiyama can take. So I took him down. Guys. I want to use this expression, but he's a high level judoka but [inaudible] has some good Jujitsu. He won some fights in the UFC and is a the ultimate fighter dude. He wants some fights with armies fighting a high level tough house. Finding a high level judoka with beautiful skin. I cannot skip it. It's not almost, you can take almost out of that statement. He's got cold skin. Fuck, fuck. Be Ground. How about big goals? Damn right ma'am. Goal we call a medium goal. Oh Man. Well there's some Asians that cross into that like darker relm. They got a little pops in Asian and then the wholesaler with the ties can get really dark. He's just straight Japanese and just and goes to the Korean tanning salon.

Speaker 3:          01:30:29       Thousand 14 you comes from a different land. He's a gold card to Brazil. My boyfriend right there. Step back into why would he step back in and you guys are grappling as one. He didn't like it, didn't like something he thought maybe was going to get us back to the why didn't he? Why would he go backwards? That's the sign of his short say body unsure passer. Some show like to hold this position too, right? Randy couture said they're not comfortable for grounds. Guys who are heavy top grapplers stay in half guard. They're comfortable there. They can do damage and control scapes. Yeah, that's what Randy was saying, that his skin is straight. Let's just all develop it's distractions. All I can see this gold as well. That's the only thing that matters in this fight about the gold shorts to go with the gold shorts. It's like a black on black Mercedes roll down the street with a high tech and the boyfriend patch on his shorts. Aki yamas mirror window soccer. Robbie used to go into the cage with a shirt that just said water and weird fake glass and the Japanese look so good. It's just like an ancient symbol like walking in water like this. Just the irony full of written a symmetry to them. Hi, I regrets. We're goofy Shit Shit. Who's have Japanese things tattooed on. They don't even know what it means.

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       Brian got in, I think it was Chinese. He thought he was getting Brian Tattooed on his arm and it says waterfall. He didn't know he wanted his. Yeah, he wanted his name tattooed on his arm and the dude fucked it up. Waterfall. Probably an American dude. Oh, big elbow by Akiyama doctor Yama looks heavy on top. Both such good grappler. You know that those judo guys are so God damn strong. Gonzaga similar. This Gonzaga is another one. Like Shane car went in a lot of ways, has knockout power. When he gets onto the scale like and he walks onto the stage where the scale is, it's a different thing. It's like a stone man is walking on. It's fine, he's fine. And I know you know what's up, Darling. Just turn that standard crouch against him. You know, you guys back up. Look at this. A real legit judoka backing notes.

Speaker 4:          01:32:55       Dan Kick, no extension, no extension. He hit it and then he pulled out of it. [inaudible] American Jim it right. Well, it's not that. No. These guys, they don't have the extension. It's an they're doing the technique in a way that works. Who closed. It's not the most, no. Even when it's in close man, still extent you could extend it. Whenever you throw that kick. It's never bouncing off ever. You never bounce off. You can always extend and landing always. It's just a matter of they're doing it wrong. It's a, it's a complex technique. There's a lot of steps to the spinning back kick or turning sidekick with her. They're two totally different kicks really. But everybody started, we always called it the turning side kicking the taekwondo schools. But when I started doing kickboxing they would say show them that spinning back kick. So I would start calling it depending back here cause I figured that was the karate guys.

Speaker 4:          01:33:44       That's what they called it. But it's, it's, it's, it's a sidekick. It's the knee comes up high and this is an extension. That's how Akiyama through it does the back kick version. How chuck used to throw it with the toes down, heel up. And that's a powerful kick too. It's like a donkey kick. It's a little different. But you can fuck a guy up at that too. It's all a matter of reps. And most importantly when you do the reps, you have to extend and a lot of guys don't extend. They bounce off of it. Your, your shorts kicks all on, or all of them, all the ones he throws, if they would, if they land perfectly, very hard to survive one full like thank God I have a video, right? Hitting somebody with one video from that taekwondo till you finally have something as a defense.

Speaker 4:          01:34:29       Nice one. It landed, it was good. He just didn't extend. See how he bounced off when, when it should have been the opposite. He should have it through the right leg should have been forward at the end of it. It should have been so much force going forward that his right leg was forward. There's no, it should have been an a no denial thing and if you throw a front kick, front kick is perfect example because it's a pretty easy technique to master. You'd pick the knee up. It's very normal mechanics, but when you throw a front kick, you almost always go forward with the kick. You very rarely throw front kick and then pull it all the way back behind you. Right. That's not, it's not a natural movement cause to do the front kick and put weight into it, you're going to naturally step forward will the, you should do the same thing with the turning sidekick.

Speaker 4:          01:35:08       It's just people. They just haven't been taught. Right. It's all it is. There's the one thing that drives me nuts. Nice high kick by said, aw, there's a one thing that drives me nuts at all martial arts techniques. It is that one technique that spinning back kick or the turning side, so one that drives me nuts because I know the potential of it and then I've shown it to people and they'll go, I didn't even know this. I'm like, I know you didn't know. There was a lot of people that don't know it. It's just a matter of doing the technique correctly. Like Dennis Seaver, he does it correctly. Fuck Gaydos. When that guy throws it, that motherfucker extends and you never know what's coming because he'll throw that shit only like once or twice in a fight. Him have similar builds for that kick though the toy.

Speaker 4:          01:35:46       He's so good at it. No, because my friend Larry Jones had a better turning side than me. How bad. It was like six foot three, six foot four somewhere around then and he was, he fought it. Heavyweight in taekwondo tournament's Larry. I was always short but Larry was always, he had these ridiculous legs. They would go up to his tits and he would throw this front leg side kick like you couldn't fuck with it. It was the reason I developed my front leg side because the way I developed, cause my friend Larry, his is way superior to mine. There was like three guys that had these vicious front lake sidekicks and Conor Mcgregor almost, right? No, no way better. Way better than, he's pretty good. He's good with it. But have you seen guys who've been doing, telling you there was just one of the guys that can break?

Speaker 4:          01:36:27       They break your insides man, because they use it as they use it as defense as you come in, they'll time at and and use your body as you move in. Dealt, dealt back. You have all the other stuff. They're just missing all the other stuff. Akiyama keeps getting hit with this head kick, man. This left high kick. Yeah, but Amir's just like just grazing them with, I know you're not committed to it. My friend Leroy Rodriguez was, he had kicks front leg kicks that we're so fucking fast when people would spar him, like when he was in his prime, he was like one of uh, Jay Kim's top black belts, right. He tagged and ice, right. Akiyama has got a vicious right hand man heavy. Oh, this dude, him and Larry Jones, this other dude, his name was major battle. That was his real name. Larry Leroy. Major black.

Speaker 4:          01:37:14       Don't fuck with Larry Lee Baker battle. Meanwhile, three of the nicest guys you'd ever want to meet. And Leroy is still a good friend to this day. But if you, you saw those guys throw front leg kicks, it would change your whole idea of what's possible with those things. Oh, oh, he's her. Oh No, I'm here's in trouble. Oh Amir. Still throwing that kick. He got tagged again. Tough man. He's just Amir's pretty good at keeping guys off to them when he's getting tagged about this. He's got to get some distance here to the ground and pound man. But look at mears. Got The heat on the hips, but those judo guys are always so good standing up there. He's got him dead to rights here. Look at this. Oh, this new miracle throwing up some not gonna work. Oh Man. Yeah. I said, oh you guys put words on your shorts.

Speaker 4:          01:38:02       Fuck that took this picture of a watch out. Huh? I've gold skin bitches. I got gold skin picture isn't one check on my Dick. It's right between your legs. Herat to the sun. God, I'm a Ratu has chosen me to be his messenger. Boom. My point when I moved out to when I was talking about these cakes shop, you got long ass fucking legs. You could throw some vicious kicks. If you ever met my friend Larry who was about your size and you saw with that guy can do with his front leg. He would fold bags in half with his front leg side kick. Just shooting. Just shooting. Chris Extend, you know, he's big black guy and just long fucking legs and just extend. Oh, folding back on foot sidekick. He would kick box guys and do to it never faced together at a front leg like that.

Speaker 4:          01:38:52       They had no idea what to do with them. Right. They couldn't figure out how to get in on them really hard and maybe the problem with it though is what it was all being developed when there was no leg kicks. So I think I a good Thai guy, we just started attacking his legs and it would limit a lot of the techniques you could pull off. But those guys were all above the waist kickboxers and he was fucking them up. And all that tells me is that that's a technique that's not being utilized. Well good up kicks by Amir Talos use pancakes though. They do. Some of those guys do, especially the guys, the more Thai guys from Holland, you don't make shit up. Badr Hari that motherfucker throws wheel kicks and I thought, hey, you're going to raise a fighter from the time he's five and on, it's almost better to get him into taekwondo early, selling him to get them used to the aerials at all the fancy crazy questions.

Speaker 4:          01:39:36       And then at 12 get them into Muay Thai. So He'd be different distance. He'll still throw the and distances and it's a two different techniques like, yeah, but it's not so, so if you had a five year old and you had to train them, what do you start them with? Taekwondo. Yeah, because he's not a mastic. It's also you're going to, you're going to develop the dexterity for those weird moves that are super dangerous when you get really good at them, right? Like you know, any always equates, oh look, it's the dog gets out from the back door almost. Is he out? I might get into Jujitsu that five. Well, Eddie always equates it. That's not a bad call either. But Eddie always equate it to like rubber guard techniques because like if someone, if you teach someone rubber guard techniques and it's the first time they've tried it, like, oh, this shit isn't going to work.

Speaker 4:          01:40:19       I'm not flexible enough. Well that's the same thing. If you show someone a wheel kick, can you tell me the wheel kicks never going to work. Hold the pad for a guy like Barboza hold the pad and let him, we'll kick you. Right. And you hit that pat and you go, Oh shit, I need to know this. Yep. Forces is a Pi's opponent to really focus on that and take time away from other, you gotta be terrified of that wheel kick. You got to be terrified of all of his catch part of the training camp to stay away from that move away from those fucking crazy kid every day they're going to be dealing with it. Yeah. Stop Two fucking guys in the, in the UFC with leg kicks. I mean his kicks are brutal.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       First John Jones is doing Jon Jones. I would suggest, and I don't know shit cause I've never fun. I mean, but I would guess I would hypothesize to, if you want to be a striker or you want to be a fighter rather, and the UFC, if you're interested in fighting in the UFC and, and, and challenging for the belt one day do a Jon Jones is doing as far as uh, everything on your feet, including the wrestling it and the striking, especially he's stolen everything. Jon Jones is throwing every, the spinning back, spinning back, elbows turn inside kicks come food kicks in. There's not a kick that he hasn't thrown, gave me that. Maybe the jumps spinning inside crescent kick. We really haven't seen that one. Only in Jackie Chan movies. That's the last kick. That's the last of the kicks. Well, you know, there's a car spinning crest and kicked.

Speaker 2:          01:41:47       That's really effective. Do you know what I'm talking about when you're coming in with this side? We haven't seen that one. It doesn't, it doesn't work too much for me. At least. Didn't work too much this way. Like the inside crest kick I gave up on a long time. But if you heard a guy standing and he's kind of, and then you finish with that motherfucker. Have you ever just because of the angle, have you ever seen me do a spinning crescent kick? I never showed you that. Yeah, you showed me everything. I'm sure. No, I bet I haven't. It's like you hit like this with the outside of the foot like that. You Spit Sima knock out with that either. We haven't seen an asset with that. It's a close range kick. It's a weird kick. You do it from a different range. I never did it, but my friend Ed shorter was really good at my friend Ed shorter knocked out guys with that.

Speaker 2:          01:42:27       He had a wicked spinning crescent kick. He would throw that and more than he would throw the wheel kick. But it was an awkward, I think Jon Jones throws everything except those I don't, I think we still have those are the last new kick I think was to make a a big impact in all of them in May and how everyone trains is that front snap kick and the rear snap kick right to the jar, right to the chest. Travis bound be thrown them. I know you've been studying that shit. And also Josh Thomson throws him a la a lot so Rony throws him a lot. And of course cocoon. No is known for that Shit. Just so now that is the hottest kick right mass. The newest, hottest kicked that people are actually spending time trying to master it. When before there was no special time spent for that front snap kick butt.

Speaker 2:          01:43:13       Now what's real and oh we haven't talked about that on video. That's the craziest thing we talked about a years ago. Like they asked you, I asked you in your gym. I said, why have we haven't? We seen the front snap kick to the fucking jaw and then you add you, you said some great shit about it and then boom. That's when Anderson, that was the first one in the Machida on unknown Radica tour and then now everyone's fucking throwing them and then you board Travis Browne on Alistair Overeem. Yeah. You know what? I think the next one is the ax kick acts. Hicks are very effective. We don't really see him. Totally home throws him. There was this guy, this Canadian guy, his name was jersey

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       long and that was one of the reasons why I realized how effective and powerful acts kicks where. There's this Guy John Lee who had a really good ass kick who was a national taekwondo champion. I have only seen it a number of men because we haven't seen a guy who's really good at it. There's a guy named Jersey long that was from Canada and he had a fucking axe kick that was like a rifle shot. It would just, it would be up in on your job before you knew it was happening. He just had this, he would be concern and he would just step in full split and slam you on the head with that heel in Jesus. He knocked my friend Larry Jones, I'll cold or maybe in the beginning Larry my friend that I was telling you how good he is. That's the guy got knocked out cold by Law by this Guy Jersey Long.

Speaker 4:          01:44:34       You know we seen any in k one a few times but no. Well Andy Hook, Sandy Hook and I, Andy Hook had also had a technique we haven't seen the spinning wheel kick to the leg hug was the master at that. He would never take that heel into the leg. It was a straight movie Kung Fu kick where he would get down, squat down, do like a spinning at break dancing moves and do a wheel kick to the guys thigh. A low we'll kick. It's like doing a wheel kick butt almost on your ass. So dollar trying to set something up. What? What was the greatest crazy movie technique of all time? I say it was real CHONe and submitted Anderson Silva with that fucking flying trying or the Friday, I think that was like the greatest all time movie technique in an MMA fights happened in uh, in grappling.

Speaker 4:          01:45:20       Yeah. But in like fighting Anderson Silva and an MMA fight. True. And your real CHONe an underdog. The guy at shoot the box, he caught him in good time. Anderson wasn't it shoot the box anymore? You know, they had like a, he was at Anderson Anderson at the time though. No, he wasn't quiet. He wasn't quite the match before me and Hoya went the first time in 2003 he went against a guy named Charles Pierce and the match right before me and that guy did his fucking flat, the exact same heel hook that reader CHONe entrain Anderson and almost had him, he almost tapped out. Hoya, Gracie. A lot of people don't know that. Heuler escaped by the skin of his teeth and then got us back and then choked them. Oh my God. Since the fight. Since you're talking all the time. Okay. Yeah. We hang out party and shit.

Speaker 4:          01:46:08       Just checking the guard. Oh, you weren't here for the guard talk. Eddie Bravo has the weirdest sense of humor. Man sneaks things. Talk About Eddie Bravo. No bullshit. If he wasn't such a great Jujitsu fighter and he wasn't so into music, great troll, he would be a great fucking comedian. He just, he just didn't have the time to get into it. I talked to him and going on stage. You went downstairs like eight or nine times. Really Dick a few times whatever workout. Oh, he stopped. I had this two week. He my one. He dominated though. Robbie get on top. Did they just send the fight and the fight? I've been watching it though. I've been watching a little worse. Missing the vital.

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       Imagine if the fucking I like the UFC said, listen man, we've been thinking about your commentary. We heard you've been doing this fight pass thing. You're fucking terrible fights. Brian's stands doing these all from now on. Oh see that was good movement by Akiyama very relaxed. Even though the head kick was coming just slid out of the way. Nice right hand just dominated this. He's such a stud athlete, but see that like that's like some blue belt shit. Yeah, but that's also on a moving target. You know, he's also, he's tossed it and he's fine. Yeah, he's fighting an MMA fight. It just, that's the one technique that I think this that I'm telling you man, there's gonna be some Francis Karmapa dude who knows how to throw a fucking, actually they cut friends believe it one by one. All the every a Kung Fu kick that was once laughed at the one by one.

Speaker 3:          01:47:42       They're all coming back. I'm telling you, that guy's Levy. Some Kung Fu. It's all coming back. I won a type one term taekwondo tournament with all those comfort food kits branded shop. Could you imagine if you fucking axe kicked Travis Brown and the head, do you imagine how nutty the world would go if you had the first ax kick Kao in the UFC? You step in and six six can catch him crazy with this fee for Brennan. Shop fucking goes nuts. You decide for six months to just really dive into kicks and you want to in six months, you want to transform yourself into this fucking vicious kicker when that'd be crazy. She could do it from your response time for that shit real trainer. You found the right trainer who can teach you, teach you that style of kicking dude, you'd be, you'd be fucking guys up it up.

Speaker 3:          01:48:41       How are you having your legs? I've seen you. I've seen you lift weights or senior do dead lifts, all these things you're doing, what are you building? You're building up your core, your, your, your, your whole column, but you're also building up your SAP bottoms. Ridiculous. And then our Paul Barman is launching bones and your opponent just launching, but bones launching shin bones. Like if there's one bone you wouldn't want to get hit in the fucking face with. It's the shinbone number one terrible blade of a bone. That's the one bonus shaped like a weapon. All of these other ones are covered up with meat. Even an elbow like you got to catch a motherfucker on the point of an elbow to otherwise you're hitting him with a forearm smash and there's a lot of meat involved in the forum smashed when you shinned someone to the dome. That's up fucking, that's a weird edged bone, man. This is a weird feeling to that fucking comes at you. Six miles an hour on your head. WOMP womp womp. Spain from such an intense grumpy fuck. Who really knows how to kick hard,

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       dude, man. Oh, some scary fucker. Just throwing these laser beam through your head. I'm telling you, anybody who doubts me, you just needed to see Pedro his own in his prime. Brian, where'd you get those golden pickles from there? They're good, right? Many, many jars in there. Grillo's pickles are very generous. He sent me a giant fucking case of them. They're the best pickles of all. Tada. So real quick is the latest I've stayed up in Oh, about 10 years, dude, you're going to be since college. Oh yeah, I'll be fine. It's only two o'clock in the morning. I know she got training tomorrow. We're in California. God did double today to make up. If you were in Hawaii, we'd only be 11:00 PM that's how you got to look at Shit, man. We should all be in Hawaii right through that door. There's a curtain.

Speaker 4:          01:50:41       Pull that back and go to the, there you go. We should all be in Hawaii. Let's be realistic. If we could all make a choice to bail and go to one place and bring our families. Everybody exists. It probably be like the big island. I'd be wanting to. I want to be Bj Penn's neighbor. I love it. Just all hang out together. Maybe we do during the day just hanging out. No, can't do that shit. Said wives. We're married. We're kidding. What I think we would do is have a good time by the water. Be With our families. Did you guys collide by the way he that rumor a Brennan. There's a rumor that when he does the title Udo fucking Hawaii. That's what I'm saying. Know we had due to some, ah, we won't do that. What are you saying?

Speaker 4:          01:51:33       You guys can put mask on and watch me how I was there a few months ago. Shit. Oh Miles Jones. Oh Shit. This uh, this dude was telling me that he got to go there like in March or April to the big island. He said that's when the whales, they're either breeding or giving birth. I don't remember which, but he said they're everywhere. You said it's almost dangerous to be out in your boat. Wow. Cause you were out in the boat and the whales will breach like 20 yards from you. Blues guy was killed. My shell both that way. Killed on a sale book. I was a pussy. I would have saw the way, I wouldn't have panicked when a dove in the water, the shore holding, nobody yelled help because their ears are really good and they would have come by. Here's the trivia question. We've already asked them. How much has a blue whales heart way? Same as my dad. He put my Dick next to a blue whales close on a scale. It would balance out blue owls. Heart weighs 1500 pounds. That's about what my Dick was close. That's about all my dick is made out of dark matter. Call me fought Nick Diaz, right? Yeah. Yeah. You fought Nate, Nate and nick. Both of them lit him up.

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       Nate, Nate, Nate lit him up with strikes. Then I believe Carmen and arm bar and a nick caught him with a Google. Duh. How big of a star was go me back in the nic test. It's so high for marijuana. They believe he might've been high while he was fighting. Oh No. Oh yes. He Won. You know, people were arguing like, oh, you know that the pain that he got when he got hit with those shots, he didn't feel it because he was high on marijuana. That's the one thing that you have to argue like, well, marijuana is prescribed for pain. I mean, it is true, right? I mean, I would imagine it would help you or does it absorb pain? You guys still the manage knows the Mary Jane, but I was borrowing when I was doing kickboxing. I wasn't smoking weed back then. I didn't, I didn't.

Speaker 1:          01:53:33       I've never felt was true. Everybody. It'd be high fight, but they can't. They get tested, everybody gets tested. That doesn't make any sense but getting punched in the face hard with a right. I don't think he's going to help you with that. It helps if you nick Diaz. I Bet Nick Diaz gets in there lit up. I bet he doesn't give a fuck. Fuck anyway, they wouldn't be fighting but on the off Nick Diaz Eat your jab sober or high. A lot of guys don't like to train technique high though. It's kind of interesting. They say they don't learn things is good high like when someone's trying to show you like a stutter step and an attack. Like sometimes I get a little bit twisted up but when they can just flow with what they know once it's in the DNA, that's where the weed comes in because when you're high muscle memory work on instincts way you flow, but when you're not high it's there's, there's glitches here and there because you have so too much shit on your mind.

Speaker 1:          01:54:30       You're thinking about some bits. When I smoked some weed and drank some wine. I actually say 10 years ago I came up with some bits. Are you saying that as if it's a new thing? That's how you do comedy and you go on stage. Do you come up with new shit? You're ridiculous. That's hilarious. Hey Bro, I was just saying, because I'm about to, I'm not this Sunday. What happened this Sunday? I'm doing my one hour. Come on down. When he's, when he survived him for, he said he was high bacon, new stuff. I said was that 10 years ago? Are you saying no? Right? Being mean to you like somebody to stand up, stand up about 60 times. Yeah. I'm saying if I come down to Irvine on Sunday and I see old Gato, he shot, got to do. First of all, don't kill my friends confidence.

Speaker 1:          01:55:17       It's about to go. I can't kill my second. Don't bring up. Don't bring up the nature of his bits, which we'll fucking ruined them for the thousands of people that listen to this podcast, so let's not just that either. You're working, working thematically. So my one hour you'll see completed new stuff. Told him to be there then you'd be there. Just makes my dick hard. I feel conflict between you two guys does this because of the [inaudible] invite me to dinner tonight. What? Didn't you have a sense that bro, you told me how to set man. You live in Phoenix and 11 bro. I don't get calls anymore. You guys still friends? I'm in camp though. Yeah, but my fields. Oh, now he's in camp. He isn't camp though. You can't get needy.

Speaker 1:          01:56:05       I know. He knows I'm, I'm, I'm really not in camp. Yep, we can. You do though. You, they tell you, you got to find anyone the, and a hard time for chewing on Mike and Allen wants too. And I'm like, Oh yeah.

We've had it for a couple months. They would look and tell you exactly what's in it, but there's no cranberries. The bill, they sent me 10 of them in a box. I hate him in two days. Yeah. I felt sick.

They're um, they're really, or bars or something really good for you to only two grams of fat, 140 calories, 14 grams protein. Just super healthy. And they, that's how they used to preserve them. I guess. They used to use cranberries and sea salt when they used to have to get sea salt. Man, these to have to take salt water from the ocean and Cecil and actual fucking sea salt. That's what do they do now? But they still call it sea salt, right? I mean some of it is sea salt. Some of it is I. Dot. I mean, some of it is made in the lab, I guess. I don't know how the fuck they make salt as a stone. I know the Himalayan, oh, miles.

Speaker 1:          01:59:19       Jury, he's fucked. He's, Oh, it's all, it's all, it's over. Damn miles jury with a big good man with a big win. It hasn't lost yet.

Oh, you can do well, go me as this weird kind of striker. He's a knockout puncher, but he's like, everything is home runs. It's all home runs and it just doesn't seem like he's setting things up in any way by a little bit. Let's be honest. But is it the game passing by or is he not as fired up as he was when he was younger? He doesn't have the body that he had when he was younger.

Speaker 6:          02:00:25       Two armored cars. Grub fucking pickles are in town. The hot ones too. Do y'all like the hut? They got like hub and arrows and shit and if you've got balls eat those. I have to eat the pickles, digging. They're powerful miles. Jury. The kids really impressed me. Undefeated. Me Too.

Speaker 1:          02:01:32       and I had one. The fucker right there. Fuck Yeah Dude. Look at this movement man. Very nice. Look at this setup for this. She's is moving. It's Diego Sanchez.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       We did good. I am good ground and pound him. That was his first big win. The Diego San Doz, he put, he's putting a lot of weight behind those punches to a lot of length and a lot of weight. Diego was his first big win. He outclass Diego. It's a good fight, man. Practice. I am crucified. I don't, you shouldn't be giving this up on the air. Oh, okay. Trash brand can text me if he wants. Look, it's really the only thing to get like go counter act that ground and pound from the horse stance position. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What we do, you gotta be, you gotta be really good. Yeah. That's the perfect spot for him to avoid submissions and be able to throw punches and say stay standing on your feet and squats cause you could reach the face and right there there's no submissions.

Speaker 3:          02:02:31       But the only, the only thing you got to worry about is I up kicks. Yup. Cause you're in a perfect spot for an upkick. So you, you would think that most MMA fighters would work on that? Yeah, we do. There's levels man. Cause you know as I, I still haven't seen anybody throw kicks off their back as hard as hoists and I'll tell you what man, Harry Crow cops, fricking nasty. Adam hit me with a UPC cake to my knee and to the face. It was like boom, boom. You would think a kickboxer would be the best at them. Right? It was literally like that movie a rush hour. Which one are off kicked me. It was like, oh well you know who the first guy was to kick really good off of his back? The one of the most impressive early today. Henzel Gracie gets all tech tar off.

Speaker 3:          02:03:16       Remember him, he k owed him for his back and then stood up and blasted him in the face of the punch and broke his hand. Do you remember the story in that part? That was bare knuckle. The story was nobody like Hanzo actually practiced up kicks to get really good at them and move Bustamante Bustamante thought cause I guess there were clothes. Thought it was a waste of time. You're not son until, oh, pulled it off. March person had strikes. Dude, is that to your head? No, no. That's delivering son to him. I'm 300 attempts. Not a big deal. It's whatever. Not bad brother. We got work to do. My man's in shape. I'll go train right now, son. I got from her bell share. Don't tempt to brother. I'm all hyped up on fucking bulletproof coffee and a bait about 17 hot pickles. I'm either going to shit my pants and get a workout in the bowl. You picked gentlemen, both. Both make you sweat. He says nights here and an archery target we can take. That dude is you get in the bows and arrows or what not. Hey, I thought you were gonna make fun of me when we went to your house. I got someone went to your house and you release those chickens. I'll scare the shit, the chickens. I told my brother, I told my brother and my prayer, my friend club was like, fuck man, a

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       brilliant elisos chickens. I was scared as fuck, but I was trying to act tough. I'm not, I'm not used to like wild animals released. Those chickens are scared as fuck, man. I'm starting to develop a farm. That's my first step. My first step is having all these chickens. I got like 24 chickens. I think it'd be nice. I want to do it personally, but I think ultimately the best move would be, and I said this before, the best move would be if like friends, you know Uriah Faber, he lives, he lives on a corner. All these houses, they own the whole corner, the whole neighborhood. It's like you a neighborhood. So dope move you and your homeys. If, if someone could figure out how we could all do something like that. You write on paper all of this family, well Uriah Faber has his own house but Chad Mendez lives right next to them and you ride owns a few mounts it to all of them.

Speaker 4:          02:05:24       It's all his training camp. Holbys in his friends live in the same, they call it the block. It's a brilliant idea. So they have like this whole area where they're all like they'd go grilling together, they have parties, they have people come over and this super friendly dudes. So it's like a real warm, fun environment and all this comradery. They all live together like that. And I've always felt like that would be the best thing if like all of our yards board each other. And then you fucking grow vegetables together. That would be dope. When I was a kid, when I was a kid, when I was a kid, my dad was in this thing, my stepfather was in this, um oh it was like a cooperative thing in school and they would grow plants together and they would all work. It was a in the university and they would all grow like a bunch of different plans.

Speaker 4:          02:06:10       I remember going there and thinking this is what a great idea this is. Like everybody would contribute like some days. I keep brought me down there on like a Tuesday and I remember it very clearly because it's goat attacked me is fucking male goat. Like I was hanging out with little man and it was like seven years old and it's fucking gold starts headbutting me and I'm grabbing the goat and I'm freaking out. And then he came over and Jack to goat and like get the fuck up, bitch pushed the female go started attacking me when I was holding onto the mail go cause she decided I was the enemy. I've been nearly as fucking cunt. I had been feeding her just a few minutes ago. Yeah, I remember. So I remember it very clearly that I remember this thing like, like what a great idea to have like a bunch of vegetables like grown right there. And if you do that and you've got chickens, just vegetables and chickens. Joe, you got days of food? Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm done for the chickens and vegetables. All that shit. How about we just get a bunch of bad ass cars. We like share cars. We get girls as girls. There's drugs. There's also someone's already retired. That's when wait till you retire as they say, but not in Calabasas. Will the steward, when did Michael Bernard deejaying argue what I'm thinking right now.

Speaker 4:          02:07:20       So does she forget your own hair? Fucking slick. Dj tide mark over look shots. He looks good on the tables that Pakistan. What is that? The Mgm Mike's head. He looks like he was taking a nap. Dare you? I'm just saying head phones. He doesn't have the luxury of the shape. A color a DJ now I can't say not sweet. Got there yet. [inaudible] guys like Michael, cause a sweetie. Oh he's a good guy. We were talking about, we talked about this before. Yeah we were, it was weren't on air. We were talking about Mark Hunt Big foot and the difference between what the kind of punishment that big foot was able to take in that fight, which is incredible. And then his last fight with her Lawsky two shots and he's down or are you talking about when he's off to you or to yeah. Oh yeah. It's crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:08:11       Crazy advantage. It gives guys, is that the case or is it just the case of the standard thing of seeing guys just have Daniel Cormier, he knocked him out. You know, there's a bunch of fights. He's taken a lot of damage in fights. Cain Velasquez fucked him up in his last fight. I'm just saying man, when when you're on TRT and fighting down in Australia and you're eating right and left hamstring Mark Hunt and then you fight in Brazil off tot he get knocked out. One Punch. God, it's a good argument man. It's not saying it is, but it's a fucking good argument kind of. But isn't it also, look, the are lost face several times during feel shit. You know what I'm saying? But big foot's been taking punishment before. It's weird men. Right, but isn't it true though that like sometimes you get punched in the face and you just getting punched like on the cheek?

Speaker 4:          02:08:57       Sure. Egan, he punched here. It's placement man. You can get one tank like across the tip of the Chin and that the legs just go. It's not even the chance. Most of the time it's behind the ear on the side of the head or behind the ear that's observed. Marshall got tagged tonight. She got hit in the year. Marshall got hit there when DC fought big foot. He tagged behind the Cain Velasquez got hit behind the air against jds. I got him behind the air against a big or big country. It's all about placement, man. Big countries. Really good at that looping right hand and land's best casting style. Right? I Lens and a lot of different ways. If I was a betting man and I had, you made me pick, I would say Roy is going to land that he's going to wobble, hunt that he's going to take them down.

Speaker 4:          02:09:44       Tkl Wow, that's crazy. The second round, do you remember when Roy was just a grappler? It was a long time ago. Wouldn't any and I first met a long time ago at, no, really doesn't use it anymore. It's crazy. It's crazy because the dude didn't even start striking into 2009 when I interviewed him in the boom. I got fucking hard. He hits. Oh God. When I interviewed mentality, he's not ferocious. His Chin is iron granite chin. The only time he's been stopped as our Lawsky Scott stomped him. I think that's the only time, and that was a ridiculous situation because he had our Lawsky down immerse site control and they smelled him up. It was ridiculous. It was pathetic. But see, he didn't even start striking till 2009 I mean, think of that. He's knocked out. No Garren knocked out mitre own, you see knocked out

Speaker 1:          02:10:33       Dave Herman there. There's took, should that mean though? That was a those Congo boom. Look at that right hand. Boom, left hook, boom dude. This is the, now he's also a smart fight. So when the going gets rough in this fight and they're trading bombs, hunt has to keep trading. What's I'm going to do? Take them down. Nope. We, Roy can't take them now was going to say fuck this. Abandoned ship. Emergency Brake. Boom, I'm taking you down. Right. I can win the fight but just says, Nah, you gotta keep throwing you far. What's the difference? He the hardest hitter you've ever fought. No. Well it's tough be Shane's the hardest you've ever been hit us. Roy hit me behind the ear. Roy landed three right hands to or straight on. I didn't feel anything like we said, plays in, hit me here. Hit me here than the one I turned on.

Speaker 1:          02:11:21       The Jab hit me behind the ear and that was the ending shot. So I really didn't feel it. He's so good at. But if you look case by case, Roy has to be the hardest hitter. You know what I'm saying? It's amazing. It's amazing. Leverage is the leverage. And the way throws that right hand, just reckless is shit and all the power and also this fucking confidence in his chin. I mean junior dos Santos hit him with everything but the fucking kitchen, Sam Dume dude, he thought he was doing fine. Eaten those knees. He was like, that guy never hurt me and he's a fucking tough though. [inaudible] everyone here loves Roy at some point. That crazy durability chin. It could be this fight, it could be 10 fights from now. It just goes away. It's like Oh shit. Or he is just that country motherfucker that you hear about that lives up in the mountain and chops wood with his face and doesn't give a fuck one 70 I think I want to know like that though is their faith. You think feto would be that guy, right? He can fight. He can fight one 70 if not all. Not caring. I mean Sally, but I mean he's got, he's got a lot of weight on him. Well he's weighing about like what is, he went in to two CC to 60 is it possible that beard could absorbs punishment? No. No. Is it possible otherwise Kimbo slice to be the channel.

Speaker 1:          02:12:41       You know what I'm saying? I'll do that train with my like guilty. I'm like, ugh. Jheri curl over your hand. I mean he has got that. There's no reason Kimbo slice had the best look of all time and nicest fighter. I know the greatest guy says my sweetheart. You know what I'm having on my podcast, man, can you see Alexander art? You have a kid cutting. I'm having kid Cuddy and huge. Me and my brother, huge kid Cuddy fence. He's and he sits down. He say big brown loves Ya. I'm going to tell him, you know I even walked out to one of his songs. If he's cool, Ooh, I'll tell him, tell him. I'll tell him I'm around a shadow. I'll walk out to one of the song. I'll tell him on Monday, man, it's God. He's good. Yeah, he's good, but I'm going to get Houston Alexander on too.

Speaker 1:          02:13:27       He's another motherfucker. God get some power. Are talking about styles make slight. How about when Houston Kimbo slot, everyone was like, oh shit, this will be the fight of the century. What are the fall by you? Actually this was, it was a tough fight. It was so boring and they bought no one committee because they both have knockout. Power is weird. How about when you used to Alexander? Fuck Keith Jardeen. Nobody knew who he was. Oh, I know cod. Ooh, Zander can got mark Hunt's a scary dude, man. And he's familiar in Japan. Listen, he's a star in Japan. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:14:04       champion. He's fought some of the best of the best of all time. If you have a tattoo on your neck, do not talk shit to again, it looks like in the next chapter. House slept good crowds. It's a good point. That's a good, that's a legit point. There's a lot of guys in Venice with dirty feet, neck tattoos and like fucking all skinny. I'm just saying mark on his and gnarliest head. He's just, I think that's his son's name, whatever. I'm pretty sure that's his son's name that he had written in Kanji on his neck. You don't mean I'm always coming up with schemes or you know, something to get a guy to fight me. I want this big fight. And with hunt, we're talking shit back and forth. I said, fuck it. Let's put our fight purses online. I when I get all your money, you win.

Speaker 1:          02:14:45       You get all mine thinking he'd be like, Nah. He was like, cool, cool man. Uh, we'll ask Dana. No. You know, knowing damn well Dan's, we'll ask Dana. We'll see how it goes. You know, he shut that shit down. Well, didn't have gangs. Just offer that to Luke. Rockhold stole paid to shops. Book Gay did. Yeah, me and busy and talked about that. Yeah. Bisping, he was being really funny about it too. Since since I get paid about five times more true. Able to me, bro. Let's talk about this though. Mark. I'm really excited. I can't wait for this fight. Let's talk about marketing real quick though. Just a couple of years ago, if you remember, he got taken down by Krista usher. He lost a McCorkell by some economists, emotional calmness, McCargo economist submission. He went to that weird fight in Denver with Rothwell were, they call it the worst heavyweight fight of all time.

Speaker 1:          02:15:37       So you're like, damn, Mark Hunt is not doing well. Look at this mother fucking now. Yup. Killing the game, right. Killing the game. Well that Rothwell fight man was in Denver and if you don't live in Denver, good luck fighting in Denver. She weighed 260 pounds. Listen, if you're not in shape in New Zealand, when you get to Denver, you're also not going to be in shape. If you're not in shape in California, when you fly to Florida, your fat ass still ain't in shape. I used to fly train partners in and they'd be crazy out of shape bra. This altitude, not your fetish shit bro. No, it doesn't matter. Where'd you come from? Jacksonville. Yeah, you're fat and Jacksonville. You know what I'm saying? Drive me nuts. Is how disappointing must that be for professional athletes like they come in professional athletes to work with you and their shape, like the kind of, we would send them home the next day.

Speaker 1:          02:16:22       What'd you beat it? Nerd. Go kick rocks. Get eat it nerd. So don't they say that the best to do it is to sleep at sea level and trained it out too? They say like no living in East San Bernandino. Yes, that's what I meant. Yeah. Train, train it where there's no altitude and then sleep. Why? Because your body, you get the harder work rate in at sea level. Plenty oxygen reps, the more energy exerted because you're not, you know, you're not struggling but there is a benefit to living end training up there but it's not as much of a benefit as sleeping up there. But training is you. I used to train it awfully high altitude and live at high altitude. I feel 10 times better living in California. I get better training in my body. Recovers Better. I do eat better. Do you out [inaudible] in La Roxanne, how are you getting?

Speaker 1:          02:17:11       Very sorry man. They'll sprinkles. Got me crunk shit. I'm also going to shit my pants and he said it's also the, there's a Hob and arrows and I know I drank seven cups of coffee. Do you like? If you were going to fight in Denver, would you go to Denver and prepare? Kind of have to, right. You know what? But Joe, uh, Joe Silva said he's never going to put heavy weights on debit card again because of the thanks Rothwell and Hon. Thanks. Thank you sir. It's hard it man, if you're fucking not mark nine and eight number six in the, that's a fucking gangster man. Nine eight five 10 to 64 [inaudible] that a fellow and you throw nine touchdowns, eight interceptions. You don't have a job. I'm just saying. Yeah, but this isn't the NFL. This is Mark Hunt. I agree. It's k one grumpy champion and knocked out check Congo k one grumpy champion.

Speaker 1:          02:17:59       Who was the shortest fighter ever? Like the difference between dot. This is a good fight and they look exactly the same. His fight and Stephan struve site, it was the most disparity in size ever in a heavyweight fight. And Hunt landed a leaping left hook that destroyed strips, drawl. And so I'm playing against Caramel. This is an interesting fight, man. Very interesting. Hunt. Certainly, certainly is more weapons, but he's, he's also disagree. Disagree. I don't think coming to stand up and not saying overall, I'm saying as a MMA fight. Oh No, he definitely doesn't. Overall, he's got more weapons standing up by 100% but Roy arguably has more power in his one weapon. That one weapon known as a, as a good wrestler. He, he has see his trips. Yeah, but Mark Hunt has been working on as a takedown defense dude. Mark Cook is from fucking out of space.

Speaker 1:          02:18:56       Oh, shut. He just, he just tagged Nelson. Can you imagine it is the first fiber. See Roy gets stopped like it might be. He might not be able to take more cut down. I think Roy's to smart man. Very good. It's slipping in and out of shit too. He's really good at that check hook. Oh, Roy goes for the take down early to tell you. I told my brother on the way down and I said boys and choose to was a Roy. He's smart man. Oh, you cut all that weight. You take them down early in, they exhaust him. He's not going to have the same power. Not only that. Hunt is a very skillful striker. He's not going to just stand right in front of you like you see when Roy went to throw that right hand, Hans slides right out of the range of shit. Just out of the range went up to the worst. The fight stopped an eye poke in solid wood in Japan right now. This entire night would be ruined. Yeah. Isn't that sad? At least no one would've gotten hurt. I fucking hate. I hate the glove situation, man. I feel like there's gotta be a way to not. Oh yeah. He poked him right in the fucking house till he goes. Sorry. He said enjoy your victim. One fucking Huh.

Speaker 1:          02:20:04       It's so disappointing, man. I mean, nobody means to do it. You try. That's a Moy Tai thing too. You know, they train that with the glove on.

Speaker 1:          02:20:16       He's all right. He's all right. He's gonna keep going. Beautiful. Beautiful. They need to come up with a solution. Big Brown. What's the solution? Is it something that covers the fingertips? Oven Mitts, right. Condoms of, it's obviously not. No gloves. No gloves, no solution at all for that. You have to have the fingers out, man for grappling. Yeah, I know. Yeah, but is it low left kick to the body? God Damn. He puts some fucking pop in that when it comes to school. Oh, he gets angry. Remember Huntsman code before by Melvin manner? Yeah, he did do an 18 seconds. Melvin Manhoef is a motherfucker straight up. Scary. Meanwhile, we got a fight with Robbie Lawler so much faster than he should have been. He's beaten the show. Rob Lewis, that leg kick, man, that's you just get kicked by a telephone pole. That's not a normal knee. What kind of knee is that?

Speaker 1:          02:21:11       The size of that need some serious shit. He is nice, but you know what? If hunts smart and he keeps sliding towards his right after he lands shots, he takes away some of the right hand slide to the right because Roy very rarely throws lefse. He does. His left is a measuring device. Me, he'll throw it like a left to get you thinking about it, but that right hand is the bomb with me. He threw a double jab. See there's the right, a double jab to a huge right hand. That's his thing. He goes, pop, pop, shakes it, and then big right here. See the thing about a striker like hunt, like look how slick he is for a slick. He's basically 300 pounds right now to move in like a fucking ballerina. Oh, and there's a clean right hand he landed. See that there's a disparity in technical advantages when hyper tactical advantage that Marchmont his movement to his movement is, but that's also a blue advantage. Yeah, 100% he knows exactly where he's coming and look if he avoids the right hand. See it's just avoiding the right hand though. He doesn't have to worry about knees kicks. He's just worried about that right in at his level. If they go all this guy's a right hand, he's going go, oh cool. It's a totally different animal. You're dealing with a k one grand Prix champion, but, but now you're talking about a guy very who

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       can stick in there and has better cardio than you maybe. Who knows who's got better cardio so far, but right now you just deal with mark. I mean, Mark Hyatt was fat, but it doesn't mean he's out of shape just because he's 290 pounds. He could have been starting off at three 40 and gotten really good shape at two 90 and had to cut down to two 65 and still be able to kick some fucking ass for three rounds. Fiber apparently. You're right, it's five rounds. I'm very excited. When I found out was, I knew it was five rounds, but I forgot for a second. Oh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about water. I Dunno if this is true, but if it is true. Oh, dumb. Roy got him with a left hook to the fuck. Yeah, he did. I'll have someone said that junior dos Santos, the steep Emile chick fight. She requested a three round fight for it. I hear that. Is that true? I body shot. Roy heard he wants a three round fight. Why do you think that is? I don't, maybe those two fights with Kane, those fucking horrible five round wars, man. Maybe he doesn't want to do that to his body. If I'm steep am saying nope. Five rounds.

Speaker 4:          02:23:27       The other thing that hunt is good at is rolling with Shit Diff, but it looks a little tired, not to me. He doesn't get stiff with stuff. He roles like when things are coming at him, he rolls away from things. Yeah. He takes a lot of the power off of those punches when he does that. And for someone who's not used to a guy that says look like that, it also Uber Royal, the leg kicks, spun him around. It also, uh, makes you very tired because you're decelerating your own punches instead of hitting something. Yeah. Missing a punch. It makes you more tired than actually hidden. So on. Yeah. When you're fighting to get, let's why Ali would where guys out so well, yeah. Cause he would just be standing in front of them. They were just be fucking eaten air sandwiches. Look at that beautiful movement. You know what that is, man, that's just knowledge. Just knowing where the countries are. Common sense man.

Speaker 5:          02:24:18       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:24:18       Oh Roylex hold his head. His head's always in the right spot. Yeah. Well it's sort of tough if, if he knows that you have to weapons, right? I mean royal, he hit him with one pretty good leg kick is pretty good leg kick though. Uh, not game changing. No, but pretty good. Now here's a company landed a great left Hook right hand. That was the, yeah, there's a nice right hand and right to the eyeball. Boom and look slides away. Boom. There's one over the top that tag tomatoes are rolled with it though. You rolled with the left hook, but there's a good leg kick, but then he rolled with that too. Then you roll around with this, went with it, but it's like when Roy mixes it up, anytime a fighter mixes it up, he opens up all these other possibilities because he's creates new variables. If you introduce new variables. That's why GSP was so good. He never knew what the fuck he was going to do. So that extra half of a second when you're thinking what is he going to do? Then he executes something. Is that an extra half of a second? It's such an advantage that along with the comfort level that a guy like GSP had from all those championship fights was one of the reasons

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       that led him to be one of the great fighters of all time is that he was so good at being unpredicted. You didn't know if he was going to strike or try to grapple and guys would be thinking, what's he gonna do? Fuck, you already did it and then you're always playing catch up. Yeah. I talked to Nate Marquardt about that, who is his main training partner and he would always say, you didn't know if he was to shoot a double leg on backwards bess levels all four. It gets them, oh, hi. They're thick. Look at how his legs up. Roy is very good. Oh, it is on my side. He's out. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Hunts out and Roy auto adjusts his knee pad. That's interesting. What's that about? I think it was uncomfortable. Yeah, but I mean, what's up? What do you think?

Speaker 1:          02:26:12       He's got a knee injury. Oh, back fist. That's a big, big moment for hunt, right? Yeah. Getting up like that. There's the fact that he could, he was able to escape, dude. He's tough to keep down now. It's, it's all he's training. It looks like so fucking strong to look at the back on. That fucking takes a while to get it all together. Some people would have quit. He just kept going and now he's finally, he's hard to take down and he's got a little bit of Jujitsu and he's to 90 and five 10 that helps. Helps us set up, did it get, so we're fine for a little bit. Shit for about 10 minutes. So we had to cut the two 65 pounds in one day. They said he lost 19 pounds in one day. So he's at least, you know, a solid two 84 solid too.

Speaker 1:          02:27:05       That's so ridiculous. It's so ridiculous. If he got down at two oh five but meanwhile he fucking moves good. He moves good. But you know what, Mike Daltrey made some really good points. He was talking about Cain Velasquez. He was like, yeah, he's the best of all time. Yeah, he's awesome and fade or, yeah, he was fucking amazing in his prime. And probably Oh nice, right hand. But he goes, he would have been even better if he lost that. But I disagree. I disagree. I think you need some body fat. It listen. And like I said, we all love Mike Dolce. It's not a bodybuilding competition. If, if fate or Cain Velasquez had both had six packs, they wouldn't have the same cardio. That's interesting. I think you need some of that fat halfs on that cardio. But when you're trying to cut weight, uh, Dan heavyweights on 35 heavyweights. Yeah, for sure. So why don't we tango, wait a second. I have the best card in the game. Let me change my diet and get the six pack. Cause Dolce thinks I need to be less or fat. Plus he's going to alienate a lot of people that love Roy Nelson because Roy Nelson looks at the average American, oh shit. Oh boy. Like that mark. Oh Roy Nelson fires back. This is what Roy wants, man. Man. If you didn't know Roy Nelson was a UFC fighter and you saw that

Speaker 3:          02:28:22       Dubai, a swearing pool, and you talk shit to him, Bro, fucking colossal mistake. That would be a huge, instead of, Oh my God, Oh my God, a bad mother. Oh my God, I've never seen that. Never Seen Ryan else and take a shower. Holy Shit. Wow. No, that's fucking scary. What do you mean? Oh No, you hate mar hunt. No, I'm just saying. Wow. That was crazy. He said, no, no, no. Mark Hump walks away to halo. How he does that, that walk away. He's done that to three dudes. Now how expansive this, Ooh. Cheers. Mark Hunt is the king of the walkaway. Kao He tripped right there looking at it, but that's the referee gotten to watch it again. The referee pushed him. Bullshit. Watches the fucking referee. Sowhat hey, we should have blocked the rough, but a foreign minister and the referee room. Beautiful. Crazy, beautiful walk off.

Speaker 3:          02:29:48       K got caught right in the chin. Well, he got caught by one of the best strikers in MMA period. Hardest by far, the serious heavyweight fighters. Nobody moves. I can with the scissors or juniors junior harder than cane. 100% but he moves so smooth. He moves like a big black guy. Right? Oh Wow. Wow. Yeah. That's all you Doug cream. No, but you know what I'm talking about talking about green. No money. Roy's no professionally, professionally, but he moved like a brother. Well, I think what Samoans, you know have one of the things that they like. There's so many guys like David [inaudible], Mark Hunt, they have incredible ability to generate power beast like David to do you remember David too? When he's his primary John Ruiz. Jesus. Fuck Louisa's. He had this Jesus, Louise, and no one has a bigger fucking jaw, like who's got like a wider mount Rushmore jaw and Mark Hunt. He takes a tremendous bomb. How old is he? I think he's like 38 or 39 or something like that. Every bit of it.

Speaker 6:          02:30:58       38 thank you. Jesus. He looks 29

Speaker 3:          02:31:11       is that Chinese tomorrow or next week? He's in his fucking prime. That's, that's a fact.

Speaker 6:          02:31:18       Top 10 opponent is hurting heavyweight out there. You got your sights set on that. You'd like to fight back. It's about Ya'll. My little buddy,

Speaker 4:          02:31:38       he's a great guy. I hung out with them in the airport, him and his training partner. He's a sweetheart, really, really fun guy to hang out with and talk to him. Very friendly. It's so common there. You know what you were saying earlier about him, about his career being in. Here's one further. When he first got signed by the UFC, like they had a strike force contract. They didn't want to honor it, and he did his pride contract. They didn't want to honor his pride contract and not, not that they didn't want to honor it, but they didn't want him to fight. They wanted to pay him off and he said, no, I want to fight. Not that they want to honor. Of course they would honor any contract, but he did. They didn't think that. He was like, you know, UFC material. What's happening? What's going on? They didn't think he was UFC material. We thought, you know, he'd lost a few guys and he said, look, I want to prove it to you. And then he loses his first fight and fuck and they give them a second chance

Speaker 1:          02:32:31       and then man on a row. Super impressive. That was insane. He lost how many straight? Well, he lost to McCorkell and then he loves to tell that to junior dos Santos, is that the next loss or was there a loss in Magento? He lost to McCorkell than he did. He lose that decision in Denver. That's a good question. Did he beat Brendan Schaub? I mean, not, not burning sharp. He's right here. Ben Rothwell, Ben Rothwell in Denver. I forget. I knows a decision. Let me pull it up. Mark Hunt. That damn, I've never seen really get taken out like that. Fuck. That was beautiful, man. Dude. That shit was beautiful. Dope ass picture on Wikipedia. You guys, have you guys seen Josh Barnett and a hand out do a scene from Brokeback mountain? No, of course. I haven't seen it. Have you seen it? No. Oh my God. Did go hand out the [inaudible] show episode for Josh Barnett and out the load Anja doing a scene from Brokeback mountain.

Speaker 1:          02:33:33       It's branding. What did I say? I said we need to restart reenacting. The Silva fight was a draw, but wasn't that fight changed because of the, the drug thing then like they disqualify who draw. So there's no, there's no winter though. Is that what it was? His draw big money and bonus money for the fight of the night. So he lost junior scientists before that. He'd beat Stephan's true check Congo, Ben Rothwell and tuck shirts. So there's McCorkle was the last, just the one that won for neuro and then he fought Dosantos and then he had the war with bigfoot shitload. Right? Get that [inaudible] two, three, four, five. He lost six in a row to the gets submitted by Musashi. We get the guys who was filed by a man who get the guys who was fighting. Josh Barnett fader was an interesting fight, man. Remember when he had fade or in an arm lock?

Speaker 1:          02:34:26       Remember that? I forget and I'm like, you're Kamora, but he couldn't finish it. Those are some and Josh Barnett, those early days though, he's a pure striker, no nothing. You know, they didn't know what he was doing. He was learning, but he beat Mirko Cro cop in his prime t Vandelay Silva man. He, he, you know, a lot of people think he was the guy that ruined Vandelay cause Vandelay fought him as a heavyweight and at Vandelay was the 203 pound champion. He was fucking everybody up at two oh three and went up and fought. And he actually thinks, I believe, if I remember correctly, he was light when he fought, um, hunt. I think he was only like one 99 and he fought hunt white for him. Like when he fought cro cop, he was super heavy. He was like, he was heavier than Cro cop, if I remember correctly, Vandelay was like two 18 and cro cop was two 14.

Speaker 1:          02:35:12       Wow. Vandelay was just said the cro cop is the strongest guy you ever felt, right? Yeah. What did you weigh when you fought him to 21 or something like that too? Maybe that way he was he to 40 [inaudible] stronger than you are? Uh, just like, just like so like, like a rock couldn't move. I'm like, no. You know some guys you move and the like tilt, like kind of budge. Do you think it's like, it's like a statue. The legs, like he hit the guy has giant, has a good base. I just think he was like, there's no fat on them. Just like that grown man strength when I fought him, you know? Yeah. You know, you're talking about a guy who'd been kickboxing for so fucking long and the, I think I would imagine that a guy who's like a really strong kickboxer like a hunt or like a cro cop. Those guys had developed those monster as legs and they have good balance from throwing kicks and once he teach those guys take down, take down defense, it becomes very difficult. She's, they're dealing with such a ridiculous base. Like Cro cop has some giant ass fucking legs. You want to talk about a guy with a ridiculous highlight reel stud.

Speaker 1:          02:36:22       So tired. Tired. I've just had such a long day. Six Oh, shooting the Goldbergs. I'm so cute as you shoot it today. Yeah. Yeah. That's the fun part.

Speaker 3:          02:40:13       That's more than once. I'm not sure what your dog, your dog. That was a real problem with fucking doing standup at the comedy store. There's nobody, nobody does the crowd. Nobody takes care of the crowd. So you were constantly comic. Shouldn't have to deal with that shit. That shit should all be done by like bouncers. They should have any improv you go to that never gets out of hand. They squash that shit like that. They know what they're doing. I think I can tell the story. What happened tonight. Tonight. What happened? Yeah. Uh, I was at, I was at the laugh factory and there was a dude in the front row talking like an asshole and to the point where I, I, I kicked his leg a little bit. I went, hey, you got to shut up in the middle of my set. And I go, hey, you got to shut up.

Speaker 3:          02:40:59       And he goes, oh, sorry, sorry. And then he kept talking. I went to, I said, it was fine. It went well and Dane, Dane Cook follows me and I'm watching Dane and the guy is doing the same thing and Dane literally at literally in the middle of it went like this. He just and tweet, if I'm exaggerating, Dang goes, you shut the fuck up right fucking now or I will knock you the fuck out. You say one more fucking word. I'm going to knock you out and send you the fuck out of here. Like right and cooks when do it some time back the fucking show you asshole. Yeah. And the whole place started clapping the whole, cause the guy was so great. Would it be if the guy stood up and whoop, Dang. I was like, I was like Dane in front of everybody was ready to go.

Speaker 3:          02:41:45       That guy was a plant put by Jamie Masada. He's like, Dan, cookie's going to be on a one to two warm up with blind Kalin. You Go, you tell a joke, you talk to good, you speak on phone. And then when Dane Cook come on, he be so mad. He's like, this fucking guy heckled me. I'm Dane Cook. And then we get on TMZ, 10 guys and the bad zoom Assata uploading it to youtube. I'm sure somebody videotaped Brian. Do me a favor. Tell them the dream you had that you told me. I tell them the dream thing. It's you telling me if this is normal, I think it's appropriate. Okay. I had, this is my business partner and listened to this dream. I had a boyfriend. Okay, that's not Martin Luther King and what were you doing? And they'll listen to this shit. Any fucking me get a dream. He was having sex with a man. Well, I'm glad you, you told me this after I told Steve Rinella that I don't want to share a tent with you because he asked me. He goes, is it okay if you're sure Taylor, Brian, fuck yeah, I do. I still like a werewolf or anybody. You look like a snooze. I'm assuming you don't know. I have an irregular NASA. Craziest, craziest, loudest snore. I thought you recall that. Mouthpiece. Mouthpiece of a new mouth when we went hunting third or fourth version up fitting, right, man,

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       I kept falling off. Yeah, I kept falling out, but the new one is, it's uncomfortable, but it fits great and it keeps my tongue in place. Makes no sound. It looks like I sleep like a baby. I make no sound. Right. And then finish your gay story though. I see. I'm sorry about scoring. And I was like, and I was like, I'm straight man, and I have a boyfriend and this guy keeps fucking

Speaker 3:          02:43:36       crazy shit and this guy's fucking me and I got to keep this a secret. I'm not sure how to make sense of this. That's a bit dead serious. When he told me this and I literally just looking at what it is, bro, next hour, it's gallery, right? Write it down, write down, these are endless with this drain can go wherever. Have you guys ever in my life, dude. I was like, and I was like the guy, but he had a back on them and I was like, damn man. And I remember I didn't say this party cocktails, we're having cocktails and I was looking at Raga, I fucked this guy again. I slide. Yeah, Fuck Shit. It was crazy straight, man. I'm fucking straight disturbing how many jokes you have like arguing your sexuality. I know like a big part of your act as arguing your sexuality. I was like 50% gain. I issue

Speaker 1:          02:44:52       you got Brody Stevens up to 84% started the podcast. It's was probably 10% gay but outcast. He told me he was 84% Thailand's. He said 15% after that dream. I said full 50% you think you're gay? No, a little bit and now I wish her well, we went on when we went, when we went hunting, we were gone for six the first time we were gone for six days in Montana. Second time we were gone for five days in Wisconsin. That's 11 days at gay jokes. I mean, the kid is relentless. It never stops coming. It's a storm of locusts that there's, there's no end. It shows up on satellite satellite. It's like crops die. Rivers show the fucking, the rivers get choked leaving like there's no, no one ever get tired of farmlands. Crops dry up there actually something with that, you know who is actually more obsessed with male beauty. Then Brian Count as big shit here. Akiyama well, yeah. I mean that's my boyfriend, but big brown, big brown. Big Brown is, don't try and push it on me. Yeah, but you're, you're a track

Speaker 3:          02:45:59       your dream. You had sex with a man. No one else has that shit here. That's weird. Brian,

Speaker 1:          02:46:04       why are you saying that he's attracted to men? Because you're attracted to men too. Are you attractive? You're attractive, right?

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       I would imagine you're attractive guy. I'm a cutie pie. You're beautiful men, not that right now. He looks like that's a good mood. I've never seen you look so tired. This is how guys are like, Brendan gave me his cold. I was around is called. I had to go. I was sick as shit or two weeks. It's crazy. I had a performance San Antonio and I'm dying. I'm like, I'm just slogging through and I call him. I go, Bro. I go. He goes, how are you doing? I go, I'm not doing well, man. I'm sick and I got to, I got two shows tonight and you gave me your call and this is what I hear on the other end. The phone [inaudible] I mean, you were dying. We told you guys get acute cold. I got in his fucking chicks think that's funny. No it guys love it.

Speaker 3:          02:46:51       Then I got in his fucking Prius. I get in there and he goes, I'm sick of shininess. I'm never sick. Spray céline solution his nose. And he goes, this is why. Two days later, two days later, he's sick as fuck. Kept telling me this for weeks. All I heard from him was, there's a wait. You never get sick. I don't get sick anymore. I spray the sailing solution. Yeah, he got time. They got my cold. So four days later I go, yeah, throat starting to hurt now moving down to your chest. He goes, yeah. I said, enjoy that for about another eight days. I was sick. I wasn't sleeping. That's why your immune system so superior to the average man. Thank you for saying that. It's dear crush, crush all disease. Well, you know, eats a lot of heartbreak and I meditate, eat factory farmed fish, nothing from the ocean.

Speaker 3:          02:47:43       I'm God's favorite too. That helps even even as even as Brazilian character is it gay Brazilian carrot here. That was one of the most hilarious moments of our life. You got to write that down. Take that sheet of paper off the top and that I had a dream that I had a boyfriend and he wants and he was fucking me for Joe. Joe Rogan, my snog of her. Thanks for the idea. I had a dream. I had a boy. Fucking good. Fold that up. The best part when you go, I gotta fuck this guy later. I know you guys to get fuck. You must tell them. Just go hit a back. I remember his back was very wide and he's fucked. She throughout the dream and there's nothing he could do because it gives me like running and sometimes you do run but you're like in slow motion like it in the drain.

Speaker 3:          02:48:38       I'm trying to shoot straight. It should pull. It goes really slow. Your rabbit gun and you shoot the gun falls upon the slow sample is like everyone likes never work. You know when you see a movie that's really scary and you feel that, that chill up your spine where you're like, fuck, this is scary. Like you're so uncomfortable and scared. Sex with the guy felt the same way. I was like this fucking song, but God do it. All of us are dreaming. Running brides like yeah, you have that junior jack and a guy off super slow and it just never ends in every now and then. Throwing that you tried to escape when you had the gun. They represented the, the mistakes of my go. You're in your underwear like wherever you go. It's freezing cold, but we had a cuddle this gay shit naked. I was treating his frostbite while he was fucking mosquitoes and hard on,

Speaker 1:          02:49:55       oh my God, listen, we ran out of time. We're three hours in shit pop on some powerful Mark Hunt. Congratulations. Mark Hunt. Yeah. That was fucking phenomenal. Materializing, right? Kind of saw it materializing. So how smooth he was the only guy in this room who has to actually contemplate fight. That guy is breading shrouds these deep 40, she'll Maddie, if I'm talking, I'm sure if I be Travis brown he could be next. Let's get through Travis. That's crazy job. You have crazy. Do they want to be a fighter? Oh, there's only a couple of more minutes to go. But if you had to think of like this Travis Brown situation where he leaves Jackson's and now he's treated with Edmond, is that a good thing or do you think that that shows any sign of like, you know, sometimes people were in a state of turmoil, you know, they feel like they need to change, they lose a little bit of confidence and they try to switch things up.

Speaker 1:          02:50:51       Is it good to switch things up? I can be good list and I moved to La and switch things up. Um, obviously, uh, my know Rhonda very well and I know that camp pretty well, I would say. And, uh, I'm not going to go into detail, but I think it's a great thing for me that he's trading there. I'll put it like that without going into detail. Did you just say, can you think for him? That's what he said. Whoa. He would say that though. Even if he didn't even mean it. Not, I promise I went, I would say, I just want to say Shit, I'm 100% dead. Seriously? Do I have no reason. You know? You know what? They made a mistake by going 100% whoa. What if he hears us and changes his mind? Don't give a fuck. Wow. Brendan. Brendan, I'm not worried about Aurora.

Speaker 1:          02:51:39       I'm not worried about him. Yeah. Did you used to train? There were no where he's training. He never trained with note what he's doing? Nope. Never trained with the admin. But you did do country might have, like you might have someone telling you how they're training because you know, not at all. Not at all. Not You mean? Nope, not even close. I would never do that. So you know what the training is like at Jackson's? You know, it's like, it's a pretty high level training and he decided to leave that Jacqueline's has traded partners for days.

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       Can I just speculate? Can you speculate? Do you think there was any issue with the fact that Overeem came into the camp? No, not at all. Not at all. No. Travis beat him. We'll never find them again. I don't think that anything to do with it easily find them again though. That could happen. Nah, you don't think so? No. Never. They would never do it. Number three, let's say. Yeah, no. Well, I'm a man. There's a chance. Yes. Rankings don't mean shit. Yes. But the chance of them finding again, them doing rematches or not good, unless you're at a very high level or here's my opinion. I completely disagree. And one of the reasons I completely disagree is that the delivery with the vision, the depth of the heavyweight division is not that there's not that broad. I mean there's not that many trains with Andre Arlovski.

Speaker 4:          02:52:48       Yeah, it's true. So you think he was just like, fuck it, I'm out of here, but look, because our Lawsky stays in our lost keys fighting over him, or lambskin Overeem are in the same camp. Just because they're both heavy weights. It doesn't mean to, Travis Browne agrees with that. So Travis Browne could have been the situation where he felt like he was one of the top heavyweights in camp. He beat Overeem, then all sudden ovary moves in. And then on top of that he loses the fight with VRE doom. He doesn't like how he felt in that fight. Feels like you need to add some things to his game. And one of the things that he said, he said he didn't know how to fight. He said he knew how to go out there and fuck guys up, but he didn't know how to fight like the technical aspects of fighting, which is kind of, you know, it's interesting saying that when he's like, you're dealing with Mike Winkeljohn, you know there's like an outstanding striking coach.

Speaker 4:          02:53:31       Like one of the best in the world we called. I've seen Winkeljohn cause the monster. So wizard. So Travis is working with him and then he goes from that saying that he really didn't know how to fight. And Edmund is teaching them how to fight. I mean, it's interesting. Well, look what Edmonds done for Rhonda. He's, she wasn't negative, a striker and the Tam and all of a sudden, all of a sudden Rhonda can, it took her a while because I was even doubting. I was even thinking, damn, she ever gonna be a serious threat on her feet. She's becoming a serious threat. Fuck can at the rate she's going another couple of years, two or three years, Rhonda might just stay standing for a while longer. You know, that's that chocolate dealt type thing. You know, if you can't take her down, what the fuck are you going to do?

Speaker 4:          02:54:11       If she could knock you out in the feed when Rhonda blasted Sarah McMahon, would that need of the body? That sense? That was a big fucking message. You know, that was a big message. Samak last time we were here you said you didn't, you didn't feel that Rhonda Cyborg was a good, uh, uh, like you weren't happy about that potential matchup. Have you changed since then because of all of that? Has there been anything? I just don't, I just don't think you would be good for the UFC with Cyborg history, with steroids and, and, and Ronda being very pretty and being in movies, it's not going to be good if she were to lose to Cyborg. That's all I'm saying. I think Cyborg is a great fighter. I don't think as a marketing standpoint and for the future of the UFC. Cyborg is your champ is a good thing. Do you think that she should be out forever because of the fact that she did? Uh, she keeps winning. She keeps winning and I'd give her a shot. She's got to have a shout. The time everyone

Speaker 3:          02:55:04       see how she feels almost got fucking shot. Cyborg is zeroed in on Rhonda. That's all. What else? Fucking but every fight. Every girl seems like it's an evitable. Come on, Gina. Carano they're like, no, it's fine. Why don't we bring you back. You tap out in like a minute or so and we'll do all this marketing and then you get out. Everyone wants to fight Ronda. They know they're not going to win the market and they get from it, but saying the fight that most MMA fans want to see MMA, not mainstream, but it would be, it would be beautiful mainstream. All the regular. They'd be probably behind Rhonda because cyborgs. Yeah. Everyone would be behind Ronnie. We a Cyborg. She had some steroid abuse before and all that stuff, but still, that's what makes it an amazing fighters. You have chickens, you super yolked crazy looking sheet.

Speaker 3:          02:55:56       Cyborg is the perfect nickname for against Ronda. That pretty judo girl. I think that is going to be the fight of the millennium sidebar. I don't want that anymore. She doesn't look like that anymore. She does. She looks like a strong woman now. Yeah. She just does not look like she used to live. Well. Still still stood up as far as, as far as women's MMA, that is probably the biggest money fight right there. Yeah, that would be huge. Moneywise I don't think so. Cause more. The mainstream knows Gina. The mainstream doesn't know Cyborg and they're like, oh, I don't want to see one eye on cyber of countdown and that's over. You know what I mean? It's totally sellable. It's a terrifying fight and it's, I think it's completely sellable, not only damn thing, it's sellable. I think if she keeps winning, it's a must. It's a must have fight. I mean, I don't know if it's ever going to take place, but if she, if Cyborg, if you go back and watch the fucking video of her beaten up, Gina Carano beaten up. I talk too much. When she found Gina, you're like, what are we doing? It was like bully beat down. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          02:57:01       What are we doing? Do you want to be your champ? You think that inspires other little girls when they see bully, beat downs, styles, sideboard, Regina, if you know, if you're looking at it as a promoters of the promoters point of view. Yes. So quick. That's all. As far as the fans, the fans go, I think cyborg biggest MMA fight of all time. Now we're out of time.
