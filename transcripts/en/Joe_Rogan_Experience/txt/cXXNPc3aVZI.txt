Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Jesus Louise's the mommies are in the house. I learned so much when I did your show. I learned about pants, jeans, and learned about high and tight. I didn't know I had all these tweets that were coming my way, like jeans high and tight. It's like, what the fuck are these people saying, these are my friends. I don't even know the lingo. I don't know your nonsense. I don't know the lingo. It's all very important and we're so thankful you made it to the mommy. I'm very thankful that I was in and I also got to learn a tom or black. Very subtle, subtle, subtle cues and you can't jump the gun. You were really good at it. Then you did your beach. Every black participant. That's, that's amazing. Sydney Casteel went over 10 by the champ. Uh, I think you may have there dot pat. Pat, she was the champ. I'm trying to remember. Well, but I think, I think you might be the champ. I have to go back and look at the numbers. We did a lot of the reports, you know, I keep notes, I file it away. I'll go back and look, I did a Brendan and Collins podcast this past week fighter in the kid fighter and the kid and I did a lot of black voice. Well, that's good because I've been getting complaints that I haven't had enough black guest. Somebody just tweeted at me the other day.

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       I'm like, well, lucky for you Thompson girl will do today. Yes, yes it should. If it's not God, they're just unreasonable. Come on guys. What the fuck? What's your deal? Everybody's so like into being black or something. Let it go. Everybody got it? Yeah. Even that white chick. How did you guys react to that though? Chick from the spokane, Washington head of the NAACP. By the way, turns out she was faking being black, faked her hair, you know, made her hair black and frizzy. It really upsets me. I got to say, as a black man, it's like you don't know my struggle now I feel like I feel like, yeah, of course. Uh, she's like, identify with the culture and it just, you know, that's who I am. And I was like, you know, I remember when menace to society came out, I was like, these are my people.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       I do it. I remember going home and being like, Yo, don't talk to me right now. Like being all upset. I was like, I don't know. 13 or something. You wanted to identify with those people? One hundred percent. Okay. Now if you lived in that neighborhood, like if you were like around those people, will you have adopted that way of talking that? Well, first of all I would be dead if I had to, if I lived in that neighborhood. But I think every, look, I think every white kid, a lot of white kids, suburban white kids can identify with that desire to be part of that culture if you grew up. We grew up in, you know, different areas and time places. But when I was growing up, that's when hip hop had exploded. And I'm saying part of pop culture, right? So you love, we love the culture. And then I played sports so every basically every great sports figure was black.

Speaker 2:          00:03:16       And I'm saying it's a pretty good job. I got to bring that junk. Is that bid on a CD or anything? Nothing. No, no. That's insane. That's a great bit. I should do that again. Oh my God. Well, what a perfect opportunity to bring up the fact that you're about to do a new special bonds. First of all, ladies and gentlemen, if you live in Boston, you trying to buy tickets for the will, but you better jump on that shit now because it's almost sold out. Tommy bonds blowing up all over the nation. Exploding gas leak and someone plays with lighters.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       Yeah. It's going to be good man. So put it on that new special shooting. A new special August seventh where in the great city of Seattle. Oh, what a great call. What a great call at the Neptune theater. Seattle is fantastic. You know, it's not so great what? Outside of Seattle. You just drive our direction. You running into like horse fuck territory. It's like, oh yeah, yeah, it is horse fuck territory by law. Yeah. That's what that guy got fucked to death by. The horse is. Speaking of that is your bill up? It's not on any special or you're not going to put that on something. I don't know. It's too late if. Thanks so funds dead dead to me. You've seen. I've seen the video. No. Have you seen his big dreams? Um, no. I'd like to moves on and moves on. There's a few of those bits back in the day that I did for awhile and they just, I, I just, you know, you get tired of them and they'd never make it on anything.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       He just let them go. Moving. Yeah. Can't worry about that though. You just got to keep moving. Maybe I have a recorded somewhere and I'll just put it online. That'd be good. Yeah. That, that would be worth it because it's, you know how it is like once you get, you're not doing it anymore. It's just you can't just keep doing it. Have you ever let something go for a long time and then somebody's like, do that, do that and you do it and it's like something was lost in the time that you didn't do it in the kind of sucks. Then like you're like, I remember that going away better before, but it's also you have to record things because sometimes I forget like little tiny pieces of bits that make them super important and you like. There was one recently that I forgot, like one aspect of it. Then I listened to an old recording. I went, Oh yeah, like, oh my God, that's such an important part of it. That's it's true. Comedy's such a, you have to stay on if you don't stay on a bit and you're not with it all the time, you lose like the rhythm of it, you'll lose how it goes. I've bought

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       like five tracks of mine from itunes that are on my phone from being at shows and being like, what? Like how does that go again? And not remembering. I didn't have it. It'd be like old. So I go, I buy it off of an old album to listen to while you know, because I couldn't remember. I go, I know the bit like I know the framework of it, but I forget the, like all the little parts of it. So then I look like a real narcissists, like just listening to my stuff. Just wake up, watch my special every morning going. Right? Yeah, of course. Yeah. The dogs. Everybody. Isn't that because as a comic you kind of have to listen to your stuff. You have to watch your stuff, you have to listen to your stuff, but you don't want anybody catching you doing it.

Speaker 3:          00:06:45       No, that's the. Yeah. Like if you were on a plane on your laptop and you're watching your own special crazy. There are people that do love to watch themselves. They're usually new, right? I don't. Yeah. I don't like anything I do. I never like anything I do ever. I don't like watching myself on anything, on television. Listening to my standup it during your own voice pains me and if I like it, it's once I like it once and then after that I'm like, I can wash it again because you'll go, oh, what did I do? Like this? Why did I have more of a pause? Like I feel like I'm rushing it. I feel like I'm going too slow or I'm feeling I'm done. But that's how you get good. You got to be dissatisfied. And when you run into someone and they love everything they do, they almost always suck.

Speaker 3:          00:07:29       Yeah, that's true. Yeah. That's, it's never done. Fucking. Nothing's ever done. David Letterman was said to hate everything he ever did come home and just be like, that was the worst episode I've ever done. Well, my friend used to be his assistant and after, after like, like he would film a show and they would fucking throw things around his office. I fucking suck. Like you would get crazy and mad. We get mad. He would just take a notebook filled with shit fucking slam against a window. He didn't give a fuck who's angry? Some guy told me a story once that he was a guest on Letterman a while ago and that he was going after the show, he was going to go to Montana for him to see his family was during the holidays. It was like the last episode before Christmas and that, um, and then letterman had a place in Montana and so they discussed it on the air.

Speaker 3:          00:08:19       It was like, oh, like I'm going to Montana, and he was like, yeah, me too. And then they went to commercial break and he was like, how are you getting there to let him in? He was like flying private and he goes, what? He goes, there's no way we're getting on the same plane together because he was notoriously kind of antisocial, you know? Whoa. Who's this guy trying to fucking hopper royal? Yeah, I know it's crazy. Dudes are weasels, weasel like that to like, hey, maybe you can take me with you. I mean I asked him my ticket and save some money and then annoy you. A guy asked me that on a flight to New York one time what he asked you if he was like, what are you going for? And I was going to shoot a commercial and then he was like, where are you staying? I was like, in the city, you know, whatever. They put him up at a hotel. Oh, they picking you up? Like car service? Yeah. He's like, you think I could get her

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       ride a guy that you just met right there, right on the. Yeah, and that was not a good sign. If somebody imposing themselves on you like that, that's, that's not the kind of person that you want to hang out with these, but there could be a conversation where you're talking to a guy and you're having a great time. You haven't lapsed. You have a few drinks, a five hour flight. The guy's got a great sense of humor and you're like, where you stand on the street? Do you need a ride? Oh, that's great, but do you think you could give me a ride? Is almost never a good question. It's a little presents as a friend, you know, and he asked me, he's like, what are you getting?

Speaker 3:          00:09:46       What are you making for this commercial? I go, I was trying to be like a miracle about it. I was like, I don't know, you get like a day rate, you know, and then it's all about the residuals. And he was like, Huh. And I was explaining it to him and then he told me what he did and I go, so like, what is that? I was like, returning the question, right? What do you make? He goes, oh, I would never divulge that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       I just told you everything. Know I'm not telling you this shit. Don't fault. Did he have a reason for that? He was like, just the type of work that I do with my clients wouldn't appreciate me develop. I would say welcome to my act. Yeah, you're fucking weird talking about you a lot. I'm going to try to open with you tonight. Weirdos. You sit next to, on a plane. I just make up lies. Now. I don't tell them what I really do. Really. It opens up that whole were even married a. is it funny all the time and you know, I can't, I just, I can't. Very finite tolerance for people. What's your goat? Do you have a goto professional? I say, uh, immigration paralegal. Because I did that at a point in my life and it's not that interesting. Like there's not too many follow up question.

Speaker 1:          00:11:03       That's a good one. What's a good one? You can't get away with two famous back in the day. I used to tell girls that I worked for my father's insurance company. That's a good one. Insurance. Oh my God. I had this one girl berate me, berate me for my lack of ambition and you know, telling me what a pitch I was. And uh, and then I told her, I go, look, I go, I only have to work eight hours a day. I go, the rest of the day is entirely mine. I can do whatever I want, like, you know. And she was like, don't you want to do your own thing? Like why do you want to work for your parents? You know, like, you think that's cool to work for your father's company? Like, that's pathetic. I go, well, it's a family business. Oh, she was brutal.

Speaker 1:          00:11:42       It was a family business and you know, I'm like, but I live in my dad's basement. I took it to the next level so I save on rent. And she was. So were you attracted to this woman? She's very pretty. Yeah. She's very pretty. She, she was brutalizing me. Yeah. And I, I let her go for a let it go for a long time. What does she do for a living? I have no idea. I didn't even fucking ass. She's hot, she's hot to do, Bro. I just was shocked how mean she was. And then someone came over and asked me for a photo and then, uh, I took a photo with this person and then she started figuring it out. This is, I think it was either fear fact, like the early days of fear factor. And then she started figuring it out. She goes, you don't work for your father's insurance company.

Speaker 1:          00:12:20       I own a no go, but you're a cunt. You're a fucking mean person. I go, what if, what if I did like it? What if I did? She goes, what do you do? I go, I'm on television. I have a television show the fuck, you know. And she was like, why'd you lie to me? And I'm like, well, why were you such an asshole to me for telling you I work for an insurance company? Like I could see if you didn't want to be attracted to someone like that. But that's rude. How hard did she come when you guys did have sex? Was it like intense bugger? Oh No, I never even never even hung out with her after that night. I knew there was something off in the first place, so that's when I would go to my father's insurance company line, that kind of gold digger attitude.

Speaker 1:          00:12:58       I don't want to be racist, but she was. And. But that means thing that materialistic folks in that culture, a very pretty girls, very nice people for the most part. Very family oriented Shahs of sunset baby. What's that? That show is so preposterous. Crazy types. Yeah. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of the girls I grew up around, uh, they, they had to maintain their virginity for marriage. So a lot of them, it took them the. But yes. Paula did you. I did know. Is that really true? That's what they were doing. Well, the, yeah, the one girl that I was pretty close with, she was 18 years old. I was 13 and like we hung out a lot. I take the bus to the beach from the valley and smoke cigarettes and uh, yeah, she took it in the but she was five years old and new.

Speaker 1:          00:13:54       It's one thing if you're 30 and she's 35, that's totally normal, but 15 and 18, that's a fucking giant. 13, 15, 13 and 18. Yeah, that's a giant gap. That's a jeff. Five years is a giant five years and I think part of that is she was so sheltered, she'd grown up in such a strict Persian family that maybe mentally she was 13. You know what I mean? Like I taught her to smoke cigarettes and stuff. Whoa. You told her? Yeah. She was real sheltered. Jesus shed like we take the bus to the beach and she would have to stop at a payphone every hour to call her dad and check in. That's how strict they were. Oh my God. So I wonder what happened. What was her rationale? Well, probably like buddies. How many times do you take in the ass for everything breaks down prolapses that rectal prolapse driving off road with a car that's not designed for it.

Speaker 4:          00:14:53       It's like you got the wrong tires on that vehicle. Do you understand that? I don't. I've never honestly listen, never been to know about this, but with reasonably good reason. It's, it's chocolate, there's a lot of wrong, mean first of all, she'd be a lot of clean up, involved pre and post it. Yeah. But second, this girl, what was her rationale to maintain purity and that's a very common thing. And like how did she explain it though, that I have to be married a virgin, that my father, they checked the bedsheets on your wedding night and dad eats you out if you're a person and then he can tell.

Speaker 4:          00:15:39       That's right Tom. Exactly how it went. Yeah. Yeah. Normal finishes up and he's like, eats you still good. So it's a little bloody fucking Christ Jesus Christ. It's so crazy. So when she explained it to where you like at 13, you're probably wait what mean? But in the book, I mean it's like I knew about sex was. I mean I was at, I wasn't doing anything. I mean I was getting my ass fingers. I was 13. I was very, you know, an experience. I was just blown away. And uh, and uh, she was so funny. This is so awesome memory I have of her. I was wearing a tank top and it was summertime and I remember she poked my armpit fat. She goes, Ooh girl, you got to have big tvs where you grow up, arm pit giveaway and fatty, and I live in La. She was right. Yeah, I was armpit fat. That's hilarious. I just, I thought that it was, it was bizarre, but she explained that it was a religious thing and this was to maintain her purity. God wants her to take in the. But God wants you to do anal. So is it that they, they tell you to take in the ass instead of in the vagina or that's like the option that you choose because it doesn't. It's not written anywhere that you can do that. I think it's a technical rule. I don't know what the UFC term is.

Speaker 4:          00:17:04       Technicalities like that in the UFC. The very unfortunate. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like of kicking it down to ponant no knees to the head when you're on the ground. Isn't there a back of the head rule too?

Speaker 5:          00:17:15       Yeah. Yeah. Which is kind of. It's, it's only applicable when your on the ground because in standup, like guys get kicked in the back of the head all the time because when you throw a kick like save two guys are standing there and you throw a head kick. When you throw a head kick, your foot wraps around the back of someone's head and a lot of times that's what hits first. The instep hits the back of their head. It happens all the time. Especially if someone's standing like if the your opponent has his left foot forward and you have your left foot forward and you throw a kick basically to the head. You're hitting him the back of the head. It happens

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       all the time, but that when that happens, that's not considered a violation of the no. You guys get knocked out from getting kicked in the back of the head and when they're standing and it's fine and in, in, in wild punching exchange, guys get hit in the back of the head and no one ever gives him a hard time. You can't give them a deliberate punch to when they're on the ground. If you hit them in the back of the head, then it's considered a foul. You see it a lot. Oh yeah. I mean there's the foul. The fouls happen a lot. It gets called a lot and it happens a lot. Well because when you're, excuse me, when guys were on the ground and there's a scramble going on, people are moving and you, you go to throw a punch but the guy's not there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       Like from the time you go to throw the punch to the punch landing, there's a little space there so you know, half a second or whatever it is and the person sees it and they move a little and sometimes when they move you accidentally hit him in the back of the head and then sometimes you throwing punches that aren't totally specific. You're just trying to win and then some of them hit the back of the head or there's intentional ones too. So it's very hard to decipher what's what. This wasn't a bag that, but I've probably been to, I don't know, a dozen or more UFC is with you. And the last one that I went to was in Vegas, and that Brown Arlovski fight the craziest things of all the rounds and fights that I've witnessed. I don't know if I've ever seen a fight like that and I've never seen felt the energy shift and explode the way that it did in that round. It was really crazy. It was a wild round. I didn't even realize how crazy that was. I didn't realize I was standing up. Yeah, we talked about that and we talked about how the entire standing up he was doing commentary.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       Because I'm wearing. I don't have a microphone in front of me like this. I have a microphone that's attached to my headset, so when I stand up it's still attached. So it just goes to this box and all this jazz. The wire connects to this thing. So I'm standing up doing commentary. I literally didn't realize I was standing up until it was already happening. Nobody was seated. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody know the tire. The people right around the octagon. Every single person. It was so crazy that you couldn't help it because that happens during fights. Here it is, and that's why while I'm working, I didn't even know what was going on. Like while it was working, I stood up. Yeah, I had no idea it was. It was such an intense. Yeah. I'm like going like, I'm like home alone. Goodness. Well this, this shift. What was happening there is what was so amazed that that would be my sell to anybody that wasn't into it is just to experience the feeling, you know, of the energy in an arena like, for, for people that aren't into whatever sports. Like, dude, you can't. You can't. You can't bottle that up. You can't deny that that's, that currently exists like that in any other sport either. There's great moments in sports where someone scores a three pointer at the buzzer and wins the game or you know, a

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       great pass gets delivered. The guy runs 100 yards. There's those moments in sports, but it's so different than a guy fucking another guy on fighting. Yeah. Or a woman fucking another woman up like that fight that's passed when we can, that we were talking about before the podcast starts. You on a young jet check this fucking bad ass bitch from Poland. Oh my God, she's good. She might be like one of the best strikers in all of MMA period. Cheap, battered like top five. She battered her. She's a six time world Moy Thai champion and she's also from Poland and it's just like a. something about the fucking.

Speaker 6:          00:21:29       I was watching Anthony Bourdain's parts unknown and he went to Budapest and my last name is Polish, but were Hungarians and the whole episode was about the suffering and the harshness and the misery of how everything sucks because they were ravaged by world war one, World War II, and then the Russians came and screwed up hungry. So it's essentially a hundred years of just misery, but that breeds

Speaker 5:          00:21:53       titers walled. Russian Russians are known for being tough, like some of the best boxers in the world today are Russian. There's they're coming over here and droves. Sergei Kovalev, Gennady Golovkin and the UFC. There's a bunch of them. There's a bunch of fucking fighters from that part of the world that are just so hard. You think we'll see a triple g canelo fight? Yes, I think so. I think Canelo's going to fight cotto. If he gets past Codo we're going to see him versus Golovkin and I think if he doesn't guess past Cota we're going to see. Oh, versus Golovkin glove could. The only thing against him, from what I follow is that he doesn't really have any names under his belt. Right? Because they're scared of him, but people are scared they're running. Nobody wants to fight that dude. That dude is. He's a dangerous guy. Yeah, he's from Kazakhstan.

Speaker 5:          00:22:40       Yeah. So his, his floyd mayweather. His Dad called him a giant. He goes, wait, no damn. Johnny. Johnny, we just won 60. Hey you fights at one 60. I mean you're black. That was pretty good. Just so you know very much. Thank you very much. So he's only six pounds heavier than floyd, which in the UFC is nothing but that happens all the time. And the UFC guys that are 185 talk about fighting at two. Oh five. Which is 20 pounds difference. Like Chris Weidman is talking about fighting John Jones and unification fight Madison Square Garden. That was awesome. By the wide, if I was, oh my God, he's a beast. He's a fucking beast. Weidman versus going forward now. That was not a team wide window joined now. Yeah, but that's a giant jump. Twenty pound jump and Gennady. Golovkin is so good. The Floyd Mayweather, his dad, Floyd Mayweather, who in my opinion is the best boxer the world has ever seen. I think he's the best. I know you might not like him as a person. You might think his style is boring, but when it comes to hitting people and not getting hit, who the fuck is better ever? Right? Better. And

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       people could say, wow, he hasn't fought anybody know? He's so good. He makes people that are great. Look not that good. What would he do to Canelo and Canelo is destroying everybody. He Shut Canelo down and look what he did to PAC man. Shut them down. He just shuts you down. I mean, yeah, pack out a fucked up shoulder. But he was throwing it mean he's throwing punches in that fight. Yeah. Now he's a bad ass. He's the. He's the best. He's the best boxer. He's very, very smart because he does ask to watch. It's right. It's not showtime. Where if you're like, I want to go. I want to see some shit go down, but if you like to study the sweet science, you want to watch somebody box like counter punch, throw technically perfect punches, a slip. Everything. Yup. There's nothing better. He's wearing a lab coat every time he fights.

Speaker 3:          00:24:30       He's a fucking scientists. True. He's the best. His Dad. Oh, when he was with HBO. Hbo, 24 slash seven is so much better than times behind the seat. Like 24 slash seven is a masterpiece at the time and yeah, they when him and his dad were arguing with each other and ms that and also when Roger, his uncle. Who's his. His trainer. That's right. His uncle, his uncle who just got teeth. It was much better than me. Then he got teeth. He got teeth now. Yeah. He used to have like three teeth and they would be the best team. The best was, I think floyd fought Kodo, right. He fought cotto awhile back and they were doing the 24 slash seven and Koto the they cut from Kodo. He's like, you know, I've been studying all his fights and I realized he's going to bring his best and I'm going to bring my best and you know, we'll see what happens and they cut to Roger Mayweather Mayweather and he's like kowtowing shit.

Speaker 3:          00:25:23       That was just him. Like he likes to watch any of his film. We don't have to. His whole thing was that like we don't prepare for other people. They got to prepare for this shit. Man. That was their philosophies, right? Yeah. I mean he's right, but he's Roger May, whether it has a quote that comes up on a mixed martial arts forums all the time that most people don't know shit about boxing and that's the video. Most people don't know shit about boxing. I'm just played it over and every time people start talking about fights, they put this play that Roger May with her clip. Most people don't know shit about boxing the fucking Miguel cotto. I know fucking meme. Most people don't know shit about boxing. It's true, I mean he's dead right. Most people don't know shit about boxing. It's true because even if you look at it, you think you know what you're seeing. You don't know what you're saying. Yeah, that's true. You look at it, you see, well, this guy is trying to punch that guy and this guy is trying to move his head. He sees things in melt multiple layers. Definitely. He's seeing traps. He seen setups. He's saying all sorts of different movements that you don't perceive. It's like us watching standup tricks and you know, like somebody killing with a bullshit is bullshit where the other people in that room are like, this guy's great.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       You didn't know that. Of course there was a guy that when I first started out I thought it was really good when I was an open mic or I saw him live before I ever actually got onstage. I paid to see a show and he was on it and he had like the whole look. He had the converse all stars. He had the gas station attendant jacket, kind of wacky. Had the whole thing going on and this just contrived nonsense act that was essentially pieced piece together with every premise that you've ever heard from every comedian ever, but I was like, wow. He's a pro pro. Yeah. Yeah. The comedy tee shirt. That's always the giveaway. The flames on it. The flames are good, but if I saw that guy today, I would watch them for 30 seconds ago. Oh God. Back. I just saw one of those.

Speaker 1:          00:27:31       Oh, you were just working at the ice house. I saw. I saw the ice house. Nice House on a weekend. Gets robbed Wednesday night. It won't be roughed out. Wednesday night. Brody Stevens, Ian Edwards, Duncan Trussell, and Tony Tony Hinchcliffe. That's a good line. That line and enjoy it. Eight one eight till I die. Hang over. Yes. Hang over to also push positive energy. If you've never seen bro. I mean he's going to be great at the Ice House on Wednesday night, but if you really want to see brody, you got to see his late night set. Is it a comedy store when he closes the room? I have all these videos up on my instagram of him playing the drums on chairs. He gives tambourines to people in the audience and they play along, man. I basic. I didn't, I, I barely knew him when Christina was on and writing for Chelsea on the show was on the highlight. I would laugh at her stories about he was audience warmup, but how he would wrangle these, you know, these 22 year old girls who were there,

Speaker 4:          00:28:34       there like about like energy, energy go, go. So when Chelsea comes out, she's real. I need you to be real to laugh. And he would hear the audience laugh. You would go. He would go like that. It was, it was. He was. No, I can say this now because it's shown is no longer with that. He was the funniest part or Chelsea lately in my opinion. They have while you were on it. Now when you're writing fucked up, that's fucked up. He's a special man. That dude is so funny. Well, it's amazing that they didn't have him on the shell like that. You know? It's interesting. He wasn't used correctly and I would always advocate for that because I would go to the writers and I go, we got to put him in sketches. Why don't we do a thing where maybe we take brody on blind dates or something like, let's end.

Speaker 4:          00:29:31       It was just. It wasn't very popular. It was shot down. Why don't know if he's an. Maybe he wasn't a fit for the television audience at home, you know, sensibility thing. I don't know. I think he's so funny and so talented. I think whenever you start wondering whether or not the audience will like someone, you're fucked. You're fucked. You're fucked. You like it. Do you think it's funny? Then go with that. Look at Tim and Eric. You ever watched him and Eric? Those guys thought for a fucking second. Do you think the audience will like this? Do you think? Don't get it. The show would die. It would be. It would never work. It would never work. That show is so fucking crazy. That one with the hillbillies. Tiny heads there and one guy got pregnant and I didn't see it. Oh my God. So many good ones.

Speaker 4:          00:30:19       There's tiny hats. I love tiny Hez tube. The poop poop poop. Poop tube is might be my favorite of all time. Are there songs like, here's what I do. I sit on you. It's just a guy sitting on other people's heads. Ridiculous Shit. There's. So what did you see? Billion dollar movie? No, through the first 10 minutes of that movie, I almost had a seizure because they have a. it's them. They made a movie that cost a billion dollars from a corporation, gave them a billion dollars and they plan them. Well, they got to Johnny Depp look alike to play Johnny Depp. And he walks in and they have. What's that guy? Alogia Robert Lowe? Yeah. The old school gangster guy. Yes. He plays the head of the corporation and this movie ends and it's just whore. And he's sitting in this chair and he goes, what the fuck was that? He goes, I paid a billion dollars for this piece of shit.

Speaker 4:          00:31:27       And then they come out and they have like a. Oh my God, they have. Zach is like, Zach plays their, um, like their life advisor. There's spiritual coach and life advisor and they just have like ridiculous orange skin and fake teeth in and they're just like, we need that money to make the movie one and it takes the most, takes up a thousand ridiculous turns, but yeah, and I laughed my ass off at that. Isn't that like kind of a perfect example of like you have to, you have to do what you like. It has to come course because you don't get a broody brody Stevens by doing a poll. Oh fuck. No. You can't have like one of those things where they have those focus groups where they show a new television show. Oh, you tested very high brody. We love when people say people love it when you say positive, right? Right. Push. Yeah. They, they're enjoying that. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Rated very highly. Yeah. No tambourine. He would take the camera and he would just horrify these cute tiny, tiny little girl came in their best outfits to meet Chelsea handler their best album. This is. I would only say this now, after the fact, I would go down to watch the warm up for taping and then I would disappear the minute the show.

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       Oh

Speaker 6:          00:32:40       No, if I wasn't on the panel. Oh my goodness. Wow. That's. Those were the days. What happened on that show? Or one of the, what was it? Fortune got us got to show and Chelsea got upset at her. I don't know that story. So fortunate actually replaced me. I got fired and then I think I replaced Jen Kirkman and then they brought John Kirkman back and then I think for tired I. Oh, I did. Oh, what happened? What happened was I was on the panel for like a year and change and then I being a writer without being a writer and then they, Jen Kirkman was going to leave and they asked me if I wanted to do it and uh, you know, we were living in the Rampart division near Macarthur Park was not good. We lived in like a, basically like we're needles meet, Bang, Bang. A lot of heroin shopping and a lot of El Salvadorian gangs.

Speaker 6:          00:33:36       It was between 18th street and ms 13, literally that gang territory. And so I was like, absolutely, I'd love to write for the show, like we had won the lottery and we kind of did it. Yeah, that was huge. And it was, it was, um, it was one of those jobs for sure. It was huge. It was one of those Hollywood jobs where I was supposed to, this is supposed to be the best thing ever. And then I would get my car and just cry and after where it was just not for me, you know, the environment was not for me. It just wasn't my, it wasn't my jam. I didn't jibe with the culture. It's just like what was off about it? It's um, a little bit of a, you know, how in writer's rooms there's like a yes, and you feel like, oh, hey, let's do that and we'll top that with that.

Speaker 6:          00:34:23       There was, I didn't sense that energy. It was more mean girl energy. Know what I'm saying. Like I think you put a bunch of chicks together and that might just happen. Not all the time, but mean girl. A little bit of that. It just, I didn't, I didn't jive. It's like in high school, you know, hung out with the goths, put it this way. If I go to a restaurant when I worked actually when I worked in restaurants, I'm more likely to hang out with the busboys than with the managers, but just that, that's my energy. And they were managers. I guess I'm trying to decipher this well because you know, I don't want to be under the bus shithead about it, but they were more into being mean. The culture wasn't for me. It wasn't for me. It wasn't a good match dude. It just wasn't my energy. I understand what you're saying. So, so anyway. Yeah. So I got fired pretty quick, I think like a month and a half, month and a half. And the best part is they call me into the [inaudible] office and he's like, we're going to have to let you go. And I started laughing because I thought he was joking. I thought it was a break. It wasn't a wow. What did they say? Uh, you know, the usual Hollywood bullshit. We, we already have your

Speaker 1:          00:35:37       voice on the show. Oh God, that kind of talk. Just tell me you didn't like what I was doing or feel we already had your voice. Fuck, is that. Oh my God, that Gobbly Gook talk drives me fucking bananas. Well, there you go. And that's the kind of Gobbledygook. Some guy came up to me at the Improv and gave me gobbly gook. Talked the other night. You've done an amazing job with your brand. We're done. We're done with my brand. What? That fucking sucks though. That's how that guy was. He like works in unsuccessfully. Oh really? Successful worker comic. Well, he's a producer guy, but you know what I mean? Like those guys, they adopt that lingo. They adopt that way of talking. The grossest part about that is that that's always attached to an idea of I would like a part of this. Like there's always like, how can I kind of weasel into sucking some of what you have achieved for me too. There was a little of that talk, but I was so unresponsive. I think it died off, you know, I think there's. I think one of the things they'll say is there's money left on the table. Have you ever heard that one? Some money still left on the table and I'd love to be able to sit down with you and figure out how to optimize that. I think there's some ways we can do that. Circle back later and put a pin in. It.

Speaker 1:          00:37:02       Blew my brains out, shoot it over to me. I'll shoot it back. Well, this business is so weird because this business, a big part of this business is quote unquote the talent and then there's a bunch of people that try to figure out how. Find that talent and then pimp it, right? Send that, send that talent out into the world and make money off of it. Yeah. So it's this weird like I'm your friend. Let's work together. I'm your producer. I would love to be an a project with you. And what they're doing is just trying to fit. They don't have any talent. They're trying to figure out. All they have to do is just like, you know, Mike, you have to be here at seven to do with the fucking catering and you know, bob turned that camera on, pointed at this guy when she talks, you need to have her mic.

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       That's what they do. Part of the lights on to. So this helps. So they're always trying to figure out how to say the right words to Kinda like ingratiate themselves and have it be real smooth hand jobbing. Yeah. They want to be real smooth and how they talk to you. I really enjoy what you're doing with your brand, Christina. I think you've done an amazing job or manager. I used to have a manager that talked and manager speak where they never really give you a decisive answer like, hey man, should I take this thing or not? I mean it's a bird in the hand, but on the other hand if you're not happy with or the new. Yeah. And you're like, dude, just what does that mean? What do you mean? Remember when your first, like when you don't have a manager and you think that getting a manager would be everything.

Speaker 1:          00:38:32       Everything that I remember a guy came to a show at the Hollywood improv and he like just was like, you're, this is incredible what you're doing. And then to he. And he told me that and then he, he shit on another client of his. He was like, you're so much better than this other guy that I managed. I was like, oh, that's not good. And then he goes, I'm gonna, I need to bring other guys from my company to watch you. Uh, like I'm, I'm sold on you, but I need to show them. And then I was like, okay. So then we'd set up another show. He brought like four guys from this big company and then after that show they were like, great, great. And then I talked to him on Monday. It was like a weekend show and he's like, just don't think it's going to work out. Right. It's just not, it's just not a fit.

Speaker 1:          00:39:21       What's the fit? You got lucky. Yeah, I really did because I would've fucking ran into that. Should immediately. Yeah, you got lucky. You know you can get trapped in a bad manager early on. Then they sue you when you leave or you have a lawsuit. If. Especially if anything happens, if you have a television show or something takes off and it becomes successful. Manager is like, I have the best manager of all. I was about to say, I love your guys' relationship. You guys are cool together, man. That's so sussman and Shandra. They're the best. They're the best. They're my friends. They're like really good friends. Jeff has been with me since I was 24. Yeah, we, he still, he found me when I was an open mic or essentially. I mean I was like maybe I was just getting a little bit of work but basically sucked.

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       You know when I talked to Shandra, I forget that I'm talking to somebody that works like I just talked to her. Like a friend. Yeah, she's. She is normal. Totally normal. You heard me talking to her. She really cares. Yeah. We're talking about the next time. They're so rare. People like her and Jeff, they're so rare, but jeff is, he's, we're so close. I mean he's been with me from the beginning of my career and I like that. Yeah, it's, well for me it's giant because I never have to worry about a manager. Like I never have to worry about that nonsense. I could pass it off to jeff and I trust him the way I would like more than I trust myself, you know, it's like give it to him, he'll handle it, you know, he just knows how to. He knows how to deal with stuff and he's always been great from the very beginning.

Speaker 1:          00:40:53       But you could get a bad one man. And then off to the. I've seen it. I'm like, I've been with the same guy eight years and we have a good relationship and I'm, I'm happy with that. Like it's cool, but I have friends that have been with in that eight year span had been with like five, six managers like friends of ours that you're fired this guy. I fired somebody else. I find a good fit. And a lot of times they're both fucked. The manager's fucked and the comic is fuck to fuck there. Everyone's fucked up trying to figure it out. No one could figure it out. I don't know if this is true or not, so I don't want to say the name, but apparently mark Merrin's podcast before he started his podcast, his manager was telling why you fucking waste your time doing this.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       I don't want to say it like that, so I'm sure it is true. I don't want to say his name, but he just interviewed the president, so how fucking stupid as fucking stupid. This his ex manager field now. It's so crazy. It's so crazy. Oops, you missed it. So great. It's so crazy. Nobody saw the podcast thing coming in his defense, but what a terrible way to address something like that saying, oh well why are you doing this on the Internet? But you had a manager. Who Was it? No, no, no. I'll tell you what happened.

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       I had a club owner. Oh No. Very early in my career. I talk like this Buddy Buddy Christina ski boat came, say name this and this is only one way to get to the top. You have to become, we need a gimmick. You want to Polish power, power, power, and I wore like a swastika. No, he, he goes, storm trooper outfit. Hi Girl. Mustache high boots. He was so he pulled me aside. This is year four and stand up and he's like, you know, got a good looking girl. Maybe you should do smart though. Do you write your own material? I was like, yeah man, I wasn't that smart at the time. Of course. I'm sure it. Yeah. And he's like, you should be like a naive, like a stupid blonde, like an ingenue. And I was like, I gotta go bro.

Speaker 1:          00:43:03       Thankfully. But you don't know. You're still vulnerable in the beginning. Someone tells you something and you think, oh, maybe I should. Listen. This guy knows what he's talking about. The sad part is that some people don't at that point go, okay, uh, I'm going to stick to what I think. I'm going to listen to this fucking idiot. You're so new to it, of course are so green and you think, well this is a person write books, the biggest talent in the world. And then boy, oh boy. What did you glad I didn't listen to the advice? Oh God, when I lived in Boston they were all telling me to be clean. Like you have to be cleaned from the beginning. Got To be clean. You're, you're, you're taking shortcuts. That was the big thing that you're taking shortcuts, right? Because you, because you talk like a normal person maybe back in the day when the only outlets for standup where you know the tonight show star search and that was it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       And now with the Internet and cable, I mean kids definitely. It's definitely, there's definitely more outlets but there was always nightclubs back then and the, those, the what they would call dirty material, you know, swearing, whatever it worked. It was in fact funny. So like this idea that it has to be clean to be, to be good. I was just like, I don't understand. What you're saying to me is that if I don't, if I don't censor myself, because that's the only, like what you're seeing on television is censored so that they can sell commercials. That's all it is. Yeah. So if you don't make a commercial product like that, then you're. You're taking a shortcut, but what about all the things that happen in your brain? You do think about sex, right? You do think about these so those things

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       aren't valid. Those are not valid, but that doesn't make any sense. Well, it always kills me when you're not allowed to discuss adult topics among adults or speak the way adults do. You guys are so offended by jerk off or this or that. Like give me a fucking break. It's so nice. It makes me crazy. Yeah, those people are dumb. They're dumb. They are smart. They're the problem and they think there's something wrong with you. I just prefer more highbrow type of comment for you. Good for you. You know what? I always wonder, doing the shit holes that I did as a feature act. You know, I've been down in Florida doing seafood restaurants and buy ge grills. Like how did a guy like Seinfeld come up with an act? You know, you know, those hard knocks first days. Like how do you crush it at the late show Friday with like you ever notice? So the paper towels are crinkly and do that because I have reverted immediately. I took a shit today. Let's check off into the just because I wanted to survive under the jail.

Speaker 3:          00:45:36       I just want it to be. No, it's survival. So when I did a show recently, I was watching this all this shit like ahead of me and I was like, this is a dog shit show and it's getting later and later and you know, there's some heckling going on and you put on like you're like, all right, I'm going to go up there like ready for that. And a weird show. It happened to not go that way. Like I was able to just do regular standup. Well the show that we were talking about earlier, but this weekend. Yeah. Yeah. But what ended up happening was that they actually ended up being great audience and I could just do standup, but what I'm talking about is that in those times, that late show, I would always have the hardest hitting stuff ready to go because for like a fear thing, you're like, they're going to eat me alive.

Speaker 3:          00:46:23       And Yeah, I dunno how early on the fear, how, how a clean super clean act would get through those, those little, the balls at such a young stage in your development to be like, no, I'm going to stick to my, my hand washing jokes. Fuck you. Because Gaffigan had, I was told had like dirty stuff billing for. Yeah, for a while. And then he only went clean, you know, I don't know how many years ago now. And he does fucking huge, you know, theaters and arenas now he's clean act. But I think when he was doing the clubs, he had dirty stuff like, you know, 10, 12 years ago. That's interesting. I wonder how, I wonder what, what flips the switch with guys with, with women. Brilliant. Hilarious. He's a great guy too. He's really funny. On the podcast, but it's like that thing where you decide like I am not going to do this is my niche. Yeah. Like Brian Regan. Hilarious. Hilarious. But that's his. He's locked into that, that niche. There's some guys too. I think a lot. Some of them look at those things

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       like a challenge in a way, you know, like how can I craft this where it's stays pure or something for some reason and, and finding without going into that language, I think they see it like an it challenge. Oh, I see what you're saying. But they've naturally got to be pretty clean dudes. Like isn't Gavigan kind of a norm? But I, I've, I've heard and I've seen like on interview stuff like Seinfeld for instance, curses in his, you know, regular life. Yeah. He curses in interviews. So does Jay Leno Leno's curses a lot, you know, when you're hanging out with Jay Leno really fucking high. Yeah. He's always swearing but onstage whereas the storm. Oh yeah. It's interesting because I was just thinking about this like in my day

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       because Hailey curses when you're unconscious curses, when he's on Viagra, you're on whatever the fuck your expertise and your rudy. Then he's going to talk about a double identity on the stage of identity being completely different. What the fuck, man? That guy who saw that coming? I did. Did you just get like a serial rapist? I had that one page knew it, knew it. He called it, but I do have a theory. I think that I always find it weird when male comics don't talk about their dicks on stage. Okay. I do because I don't trust the. I don't. I don't trust the dudes that don't because I think there's some dishonesty there. I got. I got to tell you, a guy that doesn't talk about his Dick and jerking and all that stuff. I just, I personally, I go sell something. It's not on the level. There's, there's something being hidden. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think people have have

Speaker 1:          00:49:13       different styles of comedy that they like to, like maybe they grew up watching like a Seinfeld or watching that kind of like real clean tonight show style comedy and that's what they enjoy. They enjoy being buttoned down and then being tied up and literally weird shit. But I was thinking about music, you know, like my favorite songs don't have swears in them. Right. Yeah. I mean start by thinking about it like the stones or Hendrix or something like that. Like that's my favorite kind of music. I love classic sixties music. There's no swears at very few in any of those songs. Is that because of the radio and they have to play it. Yeah, I'm sure. But you know, still some fucking amazing songs. Yeah. Amazing. Amazing. Do you want to not curse or something though and onstage or you know, in rap music, obviously that's flooded with swears like in some of my favorite rap songs just littered with swears. Yeah. You know? Yeah. But some of the great, great songs, don't you know, some, some of them don't swear a lot. See that, that made, that, made that by hand. Come on, glasses. Come off. Look at that. Oh, look at the detail of hells.

Speaker 4:          00:50:29       Yeah, that's really cool. But like biggie stuff, it's filled with sweat. So much dirtiness and all the story about shitting on a girl's chest dumps too. Lord, after his, uh, his steak and eggs breakfast and she asked me to shoot all those thoughts to say it like that. It's a, it's a, it's like one of those inner. The interludes are the worst part of rapid. He listened to the song and then it's like, I'm listening to this ghostface album. Then he's, she's like, yeah, wash my balls. Right. And they're like, dude, I can't play in front of people. I can play the alone. It's just weird. Yeah. There's all those interludes or like, you know, either shooting somebody like that I killed his, this motherfucker or it's like she asked me to shit on her, suck my Dick Bitch. And they. Yeah. It's all good stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:51:24       That's all crazy. It's weird how rap music is. Like the first music we're swears or mandatory almost. Pretty much, I mean, yeah, diggable planets, planets. What does that planets. They were like, oh, right, right, right. Well, de la soul is pretty clean, right? They were great. A door. Yeah. That whole crew of the tribe called quest. Those guys. I mean there's curses, but not a lot. It's not a lot of cursing jungle brothers. It's just more intelligent, really. Like they're more sophisticated songs, so has a lot of swears and he's the best writer in my opinion. He's brilliant. Yeah, he's, he's my favorite writer. How dare you. Did you say that ether what's going on? Do you really believe what you're saying? Honestly, I'm not familiar. I'm not a big Jay z around Eric B and Rakim. Oh, you got it.

Speaker 4:          00:52:22       I'm an older kid. I grew up listening to punk, you know, smashing pumpkins. Do you just look at me like I was gonna fight on my range. I'm still just a rat in a cage. It's a great fucking song. You like. Tell me like telling you like circle jerks. You know, I grew up in La, so the sonic youth and x and Paul, the pixies are my favorite. I like modest mouse, I'm trapped in the nineties and little didn't get along with the parents, talked to my shrink. Haidale yeah, a lot of anger. The greatest similar thing. It's anger and whatever the best lyricists don't. Yeah, they don't. They do have a little cursing. I think if you make your list like rock him a Jay z big daddy kane, all those guys have like they have. They don't rely on it. The curse, but they're not like fucking suck his Dick Right now. It's not crazy. Well, when Nwa came out, I remember

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       I was on a treadmill and I was. Nobody's ever said that in history of ever than ever. I had a cassette or a might've been a CD. I'm not sure. And I don't fucking know what it was, is the eighties, right? Because I was living in Boston, so it had to be the eighties and uh, I was at the gym and I was listening to either, like I said, he was either on a treadmill or no, it was either a walkman cassette or it was a um, uh, a disc player. I don't know even know if it was a disc. I don't remember. I can't remember, but I do remember that I'm on, I'm on the Treadmill, I'm doing my road work and I'm listening to this shit. I'm like, what the fuck am I listening to? Yeah. You know, it was like, these blacks are intense.

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       It was bothering me. It was. Yeah. It was bothering me because it was so violent and so negative and it was. They were raping a girl and one of the videos and then they shot her. She, she wouldn't shut the fuck up or something. You know, you remember. I mean that was, that was one of their songs. I was like fucking a girl and she wouldn't shut up until they shot her. Well, I grew up in that bitch. Shut up bitch drive. La exploded because that's was here. It was here, man. You couldn't wear red or blue to school because of the crips and the bloods because of that album? Yes. Do you think that that music caused violence? No. Well why not? You just said what did you just say? But that's the educators a perception. You don't, you think it inspired people to be more gang activity that inspired the Rachel Dolezal is of those that

Speaker 3:          00:55:14       I think that those albums really were. They were, they were report card. They were like journalistic pieces of what was really going on in like that black neighborhood existed already in the schools and that kind of imitators and posers that probably, you know, like I know a kid that got all gang tattoos that. Yeah. Yeah. All tagged, like legit gay and he's never been in a gang and he was so dumb and it's like that's gonna get you that you're kind of being tattoos like a south, like soda annual, like a Mexican gangs. What nationality was he Jewish was. Well he was half Mexican. Oh, he was happy he was half Mexican. But. Well that's more Mexican. INVINCEA yeah, zero. Well he's um, whatever, something. So this guy had half Mexican. He's half Mexican, half Irish. But you know, he, he looked, he looked, he didn't look like a, he didn't look full blooded.

Speaker 3:          00:56:15       But you could be you, but you would see the Latin in them. But it was more about the tattoos and two, he had the craziest thing happened. So this kids tatted up with like wannabe gang tattoos, right. Like you wouldn't know unless you knew him that he's not in a gang. He gets a dui and he gets thrown into the, to the towers downtown, which was hell on earth if you don't know the jails in La. And he's caught wind towers. Yeah. Yeah. And they're really the, that's like the one of the worst jails, the to be locked up and in America for a jail. So he gets thrown in there, supposed to be like a 12 hour hold. Well, he gets thrown into the pit, right? And it's like, it's what it used to be the, uh, the gym and now it's just bunk bunk beds because they have overrun as he's there in the first 12 hours.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       They throw him into like a Mexican pit. And then you have to. There's like a north side and south siders. He gets thrown, he goes and he goes into his bunk and he goes like few hours. Then he's just counting down the hours, like no one's fucked with me yet, nothing. One of the prisoners goes up to a female guard and punches her in the face and they a riot breaks out. So He's there for drunk driving and he's in the middle of, of the Malay, like chairs and beds being thrown. So they locked down the jail, like total lockdown. People are being thrown in the hole and all this shit. He's just like, oh shit. I got like four hours ago now. And he's like, he's like, you call over a guard, like, oh, excuse me, guard and the guard. You're like, fuck you. Like just calling, like calling everybody by racial slurs.

Speaker 3:          00:58:01       He said like, all the guards are like Peckerwood or the white guys. Yeah, shut up fucking beaner, like, like all kinds of stuff. So he's like, now I've been there a day, dude. They keep them there 12 days for any supposed to be. And he goes, I just can't get anybody to listen to me. Like, to, to take, to, to, to talk to and be like, Hey, I'm supposed to be released. They're like, yeah, everyone's supposed to be released. Fuck you. Like nobody pays attention to him. He then gets transferred to a jail in the valley, all drunk driving drunk driving. So in the, in the jail that's out in the valley. They call it the Hyatt within the, the La because it's so much better than the towers downtown. And he goes out there and he stays there two days and then they release them and I go, well, what, what happened when you said like, I was supposed to be released 14 days ago.

Speaker 3:          00:58:58       They're like, yeah, we got it, got lost in the system. Like, and he told me he didn't shit the entire time for 14 days. That doesn't make any sense. Sorry, someone's told me this before because if you're in a cell, a holding cell and there are more people in there and oh my God, toilet in the center of the room. So he said, I asked him how it was possible and he said, know he barely ate. But he said that like, you know, day three and day four he would go to the, can drop his pants. And then because there's ways you're supposed to walk and places that like two black eyes or two white guys would walk to the sink that you can see from the shitter. And as soon as he saw them, he would just pull up his pants because he thought he would get attacked and he said he didn't even have a desire to go like days.

Speaker 3:          00:59:49       So they would look at him like, because he was taking his pants off, he wouldn't even look at him. He would, he, he said that he would see them just walk into the area that he was going to shit in and all his, his uh, you know, instincts were like, this is, you're about to get attacked even if the. So he just pulled his pants up and he couldn't even shed. So no one called him on his fake gang tattoos. Nobody called him on his fake gang tattoos. Wow. That's super lucky. Yeah, they were really good gang tattoos I guess. Really what a fucking idiot. Yeah. He's so dumb because he still have those tattoos. I haven't seen him now in a while. How do you know this guy? I used to work, uh, basically with him and for him, for him. Well, his family worked for his family.

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       What is family think about is retarded tattoos. They didn't understand. They thought that he would tell them that they were other things because they're, they're really like, you know, they're really well done, but there were so crazy like the, the, the, they'd be like, what is that? He'd be like, ah, it's just the Lakers. And then they wouldn't. They're like, I didn't know. What does this family do? What was the business? Um, it was like entertainment stuff out here, but like they were, they were really well to do. It was a funny thing. Oh, that's hilarious. Did you see that? The story of the guy get him out of jail dude, because they had a very, uh, a conflicted relationship, you know, so they just let them rotten there. I don't think they knew he was in there almost like those kind of thing where they don't talk like, you know, all the time.

Speaker 3:          01:01:20       Wow. I don't think. And even afterwards he told his daddy was on vacation. You think you'd find somebody to take that phone call though? Right? Kudos to him for keeping his fucking mouth shut because I would think that would be like the time that you will really need your help. I cried. Did you see the guy in the news that he got arrested for a murder because he had the murder scene tattooed on his chest. Isn't about saying? Yeah. Do you know about this guy murdered somebody years ago and over time has been adding to a chest piece. All of the details of the murder and just so happened that a homicide detective was looking through pictures of of suspects for something unrelated. Saw this guy, saw the tattoo and worked that case. It was like, that's the store that's the helicopter. Put it together was like this guy knows, has the details of a

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       murder on. Oh my God. See the helicopter there and the liquor store to get the job. Someone did a good job and the era kills and he has and then the guy was like, this is me Rivera. As I say me, I think so me Rivera and then it was like, look, this is me homes and the liquor store, the only photos. See if there's a better photo. It shows the whole thing. We'll look at the helicopter is like a shark and angry shark. What a dummy. So like that was probably like his big claim to fame that he killed somebody. So I decided, uh Oh look, it's got him with the gun sideways, which is always hilarious. Right? And then there's the real gangster gang. Peanut, you see that peanut there? So the peanut, the peanut getting shot is what they call the uh, the, that's like the pejorative term for their rival gang.

Speaker 1:          01:03:17       Peanuts, peanuts. So it's like Mr Pineda agencies holding Mr Peanut. Is he shooting Mr Peanut? That's not a very clear picture. A shot. It's weird. I just got all these pictures of him. This is me on me. Look, he's got a fucking Bandana on his face while he's shooting all the peanut getting shot by the helicopter. That's like a shark or a dog or what is that helicopter? What is that? It looks like a shark or something. Yeah, or something. I love that he put the entire who's like, yeah, uh, put the address on his 18, 31 or two were killed. This guy, he'll get the peanuts running is a picture of the peanut running. There's brains coming out of it.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       It's so weird. What is shitty piece of fucking art and I love the sideways gun thing. I just don't want to aim the good way to do it. I'm not good at doing this. Motherfucker get closest to you. What's there? That's him. That's the same guy. What is this? Oh, Jesus Christ. What is all that? That's my back. Someone killing somebody with a hammer is terrible. People of this world. My son never gets that. You failed, right? As a parent or something went wrong, send them to the wrong school district. By the way, speaking a great. A great lyricists who curse a lot. Mc Ren from Nwa. That guy can write a dirty song and really like he's afraid. That neat song you played on our show, that neat song was about a young lady and she, he performed fellatio. Blowjob. Betty, everybody knows that too. Short, too short, too.

Speaker 1:          01:05:06       Two shorts just littered with them. Yeah. Well that song, he accidentally kills a girl with his nuts. Really Sad. You could tell he feels really bad about it. Oh my God. He killed her with a gun and killed the bitch. You really smart. I also enjoy two live crew's work. Yeah. Yeah. Pop that pussy. Well, those are. Those guys are. Oh Geez. Because they went to jail for that shit. Remember Broward County? Broward County, Florida. That was a big issue across America. Florida is the spot, like if they ever want to bust you and bring you to jail, they try you in Florida for obscenity. That's what happened to that Max hardcore guy. That guy that was doing lauren crazy. Awful porn like I'm not. I'm not a censorship. I'm not pro censorship in any way, shape or form and I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do, but there's very few people where you go, oh, maybe there shouldn't be doing. I don't know. Open girl's ass holes up with a speculum in that made them drink his piss out of their own ass. Like that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:20       So bizarre, funniest part. You

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       know what turns me on like big tits. Here's what I want you to do. I'm going to Piss in your ass and put a straw in it and then you drink. It has to be a very small niche audience. Wow. This is really my lane. That thing probably got popular because people probably. It's not that there was their lane. They were like, how far can this guy pushed out? What a crazy freak. He was probably just jerked off to everything else that exists. Tap out people hit a point where they're like, I need. I need something more fucked up. It's like the porn of today. Okay. Like think about the Horn of today in comparison to the porn of Ron, Jeremy, Peter North, Ginger Lynn. Thrill with sex is just sex. And then somewhere along the line and got to gagging and like, you know, I wrote a piece on my blog a long time ago about a porn party that we went to and we had a friend that we were doing Jujitsu with.

Speaker 1:          01:07:32       It was directing porn. So we went to this porn party and we figured, well this part is going to be crazy. It's going to be, this is going to be wild. But when we got there, what it was was a screening. It was so strange. It's like they were in a parking lot and they had a projection screen up on the wall with strangers. Oh, so excited about this. I think I remembered this story. This porn that he was showing was filmed war. It was art porn. And the guy who directed it, who's still a friend of mine, uh, had decided that he was going to do something that had never been done before. Do like a real, like murder mystery, but have the people fucking this murder mystery. So they just happened to have porn scenes. And so we were there. And in this scene, this scene is just, this girl is, this guy's going to ask to mouth on this girl and then like, I mean like otter, w, w, w, the way I described it was chalkboard eraser slapping and then like the sound of an auto smack, smack, smack, smack.

Speaker 1:          01:08:45       Wonderful. And while this is going on, someone goes, she's here or she's here and so the car pulls up and she gets out and they treat it like a star as arrived. Right? And she's, and she's with this guy and the guy gets out, the guy that she's with who's just a young kid, gets out and looks at the screen and looks at her. I think the article is still up somewhere, see if he could find that. Looks at her, looks at the screen and, and like. And she goes, I was going to tell you. And so she has a strong performer. So very fun. The guys blinking. And he's like, what the fuck? And so we, we see the guy, we immediately run over to him and I go, did you not know that she was in this film? He goes, I had no fucking idea, and I go, what did you think she does does for living here?

Speaker 1:          01:09:36       She told me she was a makeup artist, so she told him that she was a makeup artist and then took him to a screening. Yeah. This is it. This is the. The is the photos. Are the photos still on there? They're not there. That's insane. My website sucks. Others pictures, but where the fuck are they? That's a hard way to find out. That's a tough one. It's not the way you want to see that new. That documentary. Hot Girls wanted. No, actually. Yeah. Is it good for Netflix? Right? It's good. It's good, but it's not like. It's not as hot as it is. Just all those girls wanted. Yeah, know what I'm saying? It's nothing. It's exactly what you like. You could probably watch the trailer in the movie is not going to porn. It was a bummer. That should be the it. What it does is it tells you young girls are exploited by porn and it's a documentary about so you don't watch it go. I didn't know that. You're just seeing it like I didn't know earl to have fun. It was all a good time and then no, like the girl's like, yeah, you know, and then they made me vomit and then yeah, this girl is talking about like one of her first scenes, like, Oh God, force choking, a facial abuse or something. Patient abuse is a whole category. And the guy behind the camera and he's like, look at you. We were watching the Youtube version of that. Remember the guy who was like your beat, you know that.

Speaker 1:          01:11:02       He goes, you know that in the. Yeah. What does that mean? You'd be like, you're just throwing your broken. Busted your ugliest. He's like, you, Jesus. Where the fuck did you crawl out of? Like he rips them

Speaker 4:          01:11:13       apart, like the way they look. Yeah. Oh God. He's like, did you smoke? Do like ask the Barbara for the Cornelius. And she's like, let's see, like you don't know what that is. Go Watch planet of the apes Jesus. I'm like, uh, yeah. Yeah, he's A. Yeah, see, that's a style of porn with the abusive shitty. Do people I like, I, like you were saying, I grew up on a kinder, gentler era. Like I literally, I grew up, you know, the wackiest thing you would see on a vhs porno, it was like they are doing it on a forklift. It was crazy there to work on a car and they get horny. Yep. And that was, that was enough. That felt like enough. Take those fucking those overalls off. You're going to fuck on this tractor bomb now. It's like step on our next. If you could make her shit, smacking them in the face and shit and making him throw up.

Speaker 4:          01:12:05       I saw one with this guy was mouth fucking this girl. She barked and then he stuck his dick right back in her mouth after she barfed on us. Like, Hey, easy. What about stomach acids? Dude? What about the tip of your Dick? What about bile? There's that site, that site that I go to sometimes for that, like, can I handle this? The effect, you know, you look at it and you're like unnecessary. Sometimes people send in their stuff all the time sometimes like that's crazy. And it sense, I was like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, I can't handle it. That's next month. Butthole. Pucker a fart stuff. Like some guys said, girl. Yeah, it was a guy and his nose was west firmly in this girl's butt crack. And then she's Saran wrapped his hair and then she did errands and she walked around the kitchen and she like turned the sink on and, and just party. He's like, she's like, yeah, you like those dirty parts, huh? That's the thing with Saran wrap, sack lunch sack lunch. There's this guy that has Saran wrap diaper on and he just the camera and just pans to him and he spreads his cheeks and fills it with diarrhea.

Speaker 4:          01:13:15       But it's just fine. I just, it's the sound. It's a timing fills up fast just to the right. And then it turns ever so slightly. And the spread and the sound. This is something about someone relishing a woman's farts like holding onto that cheeks with. Oh yeah. We talked about it for awhile and then it'd be people wrote in, people wrote in that were into it, you know, because we were like. And then they would tell us, they were like, yeah, it goes back to like a pretty girl making something dirty, you know. So it's like, oh my God, I'm so embarrassed of what I did. So they, this guy he wrote in that he was like my, uh, now he's grown his fiance like nose and it's cool. And like whenever she has to Fart, she calls him over and he gets so excited.

Speaker 4:          01:14:09       He loves it. He loves come on. How strange or people people are so strange, the variabilities of what people are attracted to. It just, it's so bizarre. Yeah. Well, you see like people that are into people that are so obese, they can't get off the couch. There's guys that turned on by that feeders feeding can feed them or watch them. And then there's girls who they have, that's a whole business for them is they set up a camera and they're like, oh, I ate cheese and cookies today. I got to get in. And then you just, you get to watch them. You know, gaining weight shouldn't have done that. Their whole thing time that it's a great way to fucking comedy tends to use my brain to make a living. You should have jokes. Just shit in bags have been awesome. I just. The idea of Saran wrap a guy's head here so far.

Speaker 4:          01:15:03       So is this guy crawling around as she does her stuff? Yeah, it's in the kitchen or just follow. He needs those sliders on his knee and she's a really good idea. We should suggest that maybe. And we've played a lot of uh, I'm going to email this guy. Well I have these Omni Directional sliders that are workout with or do abs with them. You know, slide. You can do this way. Do your timers with them. They do all kinds of different shit. Yeah. You can put those on. The guys need just fart all around the house. Hardwood floors. Have you seen King Ash rippers work? Excuse me? What is Scott? We've reached out a lot. Offered him money and he bought. Yes. Just because he's such a creative guy. We talked maybe. Maybe the great king asked ripper the ripper. Yeah. Harry and grows the Lord of all farts. And gluttony, he makes videos of him. This is him king asked her, please give me some

Speaker 2:          01:16:03       volume that's still moving. Oh, go to rip. Massive. Go to ripon.

Speaker 4:          01:16:24       Hold on. Oh, because he has an opus. This is just one of many. But his pants. Yeah, he does. It's getting brown. Hundred Ninety $9,000. How many fucking standup bits online of 100. Ninety $9,000 to glutton thing?

Speaker 2:          01:17:03       No. About them. We've studied his work forever. Looking at Brown is good back there.

Speaker 4:          01:17:18       Making money from this. He should be making millions of ads. He's got to be making money. If it's not, it's got this. Here's the thing. So does he have ads? I like it. He's just checking every ads. What's in the micro likes to stage the scene with

Speaker 4:          01:17:54       his underwear drawer. Dude, he's got some that are so clearly. There's a Christmas one too. Hairy. Gross Slob is. Is fucked him. Yeah. He. Oh my God. Look at what he fucking videos he has with his. So many. But he has to go to this one is not much sausage. Gravy gluck is he'll watched you get to watch a meat throw up, but I'm still alive. Is coming to the surface as Christmas one. Fucking Christmas. Special special. We uh, we found it on is because his live link account is. He has a lot on live leak from youtube because youtube will take them down. So lively arts, it's just not apparently. Maybe it gets flagged a lot on a lively, lively. It's like bring it on dude. Someone's mom sees it. What is you, what is my son being gay?

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       That's

Speaker 4:          01:19:02       mothering. Mothering. Well, we were talking a lot about crazy mother. Slightly over parenting. Yeah. Well he wasn't parents and this guy, this guy is getting. Maybe it was too much. Maybe like rebellion, right. Hates Mommy. Imagine if his mom finds out about this. I think he lives at home still because we've studied the videos and it seems as though these are like prior to that location there was one that was just a bedroom in a basement and I think he actually did live with his folks and we've deduced that this might be like a fetish thing because it's gluttony. And then farts and he won't answer any other tweets that people just bombard him with him because he put an email in one and we will on our show where like everybody, even unlike no response. So if you could get to the bottom of this, we'd really appreciate it.

Speaker 4:          01:19:56       I don't want to because I'm terrified. One day he'll be in here in the morning and my fucking Ergonomic chairs, the family, the family thing also is because on the Christmas one you can tell it's a family and there's stockings up and he farts and every stocking. Then he goes, that's what you get from king as rip a merry Christmas represents coast is probably going to die. Probably there's something wrong with his colon. That's an interesting theory too. And people have also brought about the theory that he is doing that pushing air in there, you know, using. It's cheating, he's cheating. Believe like filling himself with air and then forgetting it because there's no edits between each fart assumed that he can't fart. Rapid fire that loud. I mean you'd. You'd have to be some sort of a bag of wind, like a bad because sometimes I mean regular fresh, like Oh, little farts.

Speaker 4:          01:20:54       Smell like sounded like last night I thought yesterday. I, you know, when you stay away from seafood for awhile and then you reintroduce it, there's bacteria in like, you know, it's different in shellfish and Sushi. And I thought when I, yesterday when I farted, it sounded like somebody was throwing up, sounded like a guy going, you know, I've only shaved my ass once in my life, but once I did, oh my God, my fart sounded so different. Really? Oh, they were all like wet and sloppy hair kind of different. You're, you're, you're the hair on your ass. Literally changes the way your farts smell or sound rather. Right? Smell this smell the same, but they sound different.

Speaker 4:          01:21:36       Flop, flop, flop, flop. Something tells me King Asher but doesn't shave. That's a whole new area he could get into. That's a whole monster. Dating that guy now he doesn't have a girlfriend. Girlfriend breaks up his youtube ad video money then. Then he gets a hooker. Interesting farts on her. Like, no, I hate it was a fucking loser. My videos. I'm like, no, you don't. I don't have the Internet. Shut up. What the fuck someone's babies from when I was a little baby. That's what you have to be. Your son. Could be our son for sure. It could be our son, my favorite clothes. Like take the throne for new. The new king. I'll tell Hilton, the new king. I want them to go toe to toe. I hope. I hope he takes it from one day to the next level. It's like, what is it about farts? So they're so hilarious. They're never not funny. They're never not entertaining because there are so taboo. You're supposed to do them in front of strangers. The smell, the sound, everything about it and the pain. The people that love them versus don't like it. I think those are all rooted in if your house

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       was okay with or not, he had none growing up. So that's why were were euro trash. So we loved farts and poopies parts. Was it talked about in your house, was it. No, no, no. My house was lacking in any sense of humor. Really? Yeah. No one was funny. No one knows funny. No one had any. Never. Everyone was like, don't be a loser. Stop being a loser, a loser. It was always, you're going to be a loser. Your grades suck. You're going to be skewed. I'm still coughing from the sublime parts. Um, I literally almost threw up when he was eating, when he was eating the hotdogs, dogs and sausage and the gravy, like saliva was coming to the surface in my throat. Now I'm dealing with sometimes he farts on what he's going to.

Speaker 4:          01:23:57       He's like five little. Debbie's 12 of them and then you're like, alright. And he turns around. He's like mo foreign on him and he hates them. He's got to be eating some of his own shit. Right? The first video where he gets up bucket. Okay. IFC and dips. Every fried piece in Mayo. And he said, who's that guy that's so crazy is

Speaker 1:          01:24:41       all wrong. All wrong in every way. I do kind of look. There was a time where our listeners thought that I might get this away. Him James. I was literally almost threw up. There is a, there is one we want to describe anything. There's nothing gross about this description, but one time because he's a good eater. He's like, I got eight sausage and egg mcmuffin and then he's. He's, he's tallying it. He's like diesel, 250 calories and then I got a egg and cheese. Three hundred calories. Nine of those. You do the math because he wants you to know how many calories he's eating, but he's not that fat. It just know God is good. God on him. Yeah. It's not like he's. He doesn't have some sort of. Ralphie may thing going on remarkably obese. Sadly. That guy lives his life like absolute shit every day and I'm fatter than him, but he definitely does not give a fuck ever. He's not that attache, but you think that's an act? I mean maybe some customer service representative for like tow Toyo tires or something.

Speaker 4:          01:25:53       Joe. I might agree. Have I not watched many of his films and going over the data? The footage for about a year? Probably a long

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       time with King. He claims to be in Michigan by the way, a to be a Michigan guy. How long have you been doing this? A few years. So do you think he tentatively dipping his toes into the pool of asphalt videos or did he just fucking decide he's the king. He calls himself. He's the king from the jump though. I mean, did you go back to the library earlier videos where he's like, I challenge anybody to Fart. Like I can't. Like he really, he owns us. He farts on his haters, his haters. He shows his face too. He doesn't. He gets recognized. Yes. Do you think that he, like one day he's at golden corral and then like cats, you chain getting shrimp nibblers I think I'm going to go out on a limb here. I'm going to go out on a limb and think and say that I don't know if he's all mentally.

Speaker 1:          01:26:54       Well, I think I've taken a big leap. I think if you do a pro, you like your king and he was like, in my face, please sir, your grace. I would like to go and and serious and be like, dude, I can park bigger than you any day like that, you know? And have them be like, I'm the king dude named spot. Well, what if you can only fight on his own? What if like, if you challenge him, he just locks up. It's interesting. Maybe get stagefright wow. Twice does it all alone and his kitchen a stage somewhere and he doesn't respond to the emails. Let me ask you this. If that guy put on a show somewhere like he had a small club in Chicago, some 150 seats. Yeah. Do you think he could fill a place? You think you'd get 100 people in there? I would endorse to go buy a ticket. I can make some money if you fart like that all the time. It could make some money. I mean that's why I like him to contact us. We can have them open for your mom's house podcast. No, you couldn't eat shit on your microphone.

Speaker 1:          01:28:04       Sorry. No. When you try to clean it up and do your show. The whole audit Straw. I'm starting to throw, everybody would get so fed. Oh, we thought it was going to be cool. It's got shit everywhere. Well, we'd always heard growing up there was always the stories about the famous people that like to get shit on. Right. Saran wrap or Kelly likes to be peed on. Oh, like to pee on. I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry. We should. We should preface that with the word allegedly. Allegedly. That's not me. That's not me. It's not amazing. When when our Kelly was going through all that, the black community did not abandoned him for a God damn second. A great song. So yeah. But they, they, they were like whatever. They like never. They never like, there was no blow back. They're very forgiving. I mean even Michael Jackson know you look at that thing, but dad wasn't really the black community as much as it was like white Weirdos.

Speaker 1:          01:29:05       That's interesting. Michael Jackson, like if you look at the hordes of Michael Jackson fans, a lot of them are like, I went to this twitter page the other day, like somebody tweeted something like really bizarre to me, and I was like, well, this is a fucking idiot, and so when someone anything off, I immediately go to their twitter page and I go, okay, what are you up to? What are you into? And this lady was a Michael Jackson fanatic and she had like one I was here and the other guy, the other, I was just like slightly wonky, not like super obvious, a little wonky and her entire page, her, her, her, the header of her twitter page was all Michael Jackson pictures or collage of Michael Jackson pictures. All of her. Like you look at media, you click on media. Oliver media was, you know, the king rip to the King of Pop.

Speaker 1:          01:29:52       I could sing, did some dancing, wacky white people. I love him. Eastern Europeans. Remember towards the end of his career, that's what it really came out to see him. Like he would tour like Budapest and they will love you. Michael. Do Stadium so well that's because it takes time to trickle into fit. Didn't hear about the fuck what fucking the kids kind of. Some guys a weird fucking deal. Gypsies. Remember when he moved to Dubai? Yes. That was weird. I remember I remember because I went to visit there and they were like, this is where Michael Jackson state. And I was like, why are you telling them no one cares? He lived in the Middle East for why? Because you could just fuck kids there. I think just to get away from it all and get away from the, from the circus that was back here. But I remember there was a video or photos of him like with like a full fucking head scarf, like covering his face and he had like a kid with him.

Speaker 1:          01:30:48       I'm like, whoa. Like how much does this guy like fucking kids. He likes the kids more than he likes living in America. You got to give up a lot. Yeah, there he is. Look, he's taking a kid with them. What the fuck? That might be his kid, man. Yeah, because he had the. He had three. Yeah. But he's only got one. There were the other one to talk too much in the car. Oh, you could see his little white socks that he used to wear his black slip ons and the kid is wearing a mass to walk. Yeah, that's what a strange. Strange. I'm sorry though. I, I dive. I digressed here. Who likes to be shit on specifically was always a talk about Sylvester stallone. You still like to climb under tables, clear glass tables and watch girls shit. But that could be total bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:31:36       That could be just someone makes it up, you know? It's like the Richard Gere durable thing. I would not be surprised if Richard Gere has never had a dribble up his ass. Yeah. But almost everyone heard that story. I definitely heard that story before the Internet two, which is the crazy thing about it. How it took off without somebody sending an email or allegedly. Allegedly. The rumor is that that was the scientology thing. Is that Richard Gear to get some dirt on you? Yes. Well, not even get dirt on. You just treat you like shit because you left the organization. Then he left and then they spread that rumor. Yeah. That was the rumor. See if was an article on that and interesting. Jamie. You know, it's funny that you were saying the uh, how the uh, black community didn't give any shit to r Kelly. There was also a big push back, at least I noticed when it was first going up the cosby scandal.

Speaker 1:          01:32:26       A lot of people like being like, why are you trying to tear this guy down in, in their defense, if you looked at it from the point of view of someone who looks towards black heroes and icons, you have a few hundred percent get a cosby. And they were like, oh, you know, these white bitches trying to take down our man. That's how they, that's how it was perceived. That totally got that integrity of the few heroes you have. But he was the most celebrated, like cross over just a revered older wise, lovable father figure. So it was like you're talking shit about like, it's like you were talking shit about somebody's grandfather, you know. Yeah. It's just, it's, it's so weird to think that all that time, like some people knew and they were like, shh, shh. It's like a vampire was living there. Yeah, it was crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:33:21       Now, do we know what the numbers are? 30. I think it's more than that. Is it more than that? Jesus Christ? Yeah. I think the alleged the alleged incidents or are up in the high forties at this point in time. If I was one of his victims, I would just keep my mouth shut. I'll be like, there's enough evidence. I don't need the whole world to know that. Bill cosby drugged did it to me too. It's pretty, pretty crazy. He's got a wonky eye now too, right? He does have a wonky eye. He's got, he's got glaucoma, but he has a wonky eye. Like one turns to the side. One of them doesn't move as much as the other one. Yeah. It's just the hate inside of his body.

Speaker 1:          01:34:01       His eyes go wonky or the denial of his own evil. I mean guys, gotTa be fucked in the head. I mean there's just no getting around that and his head's got to be all kinds of fucked up. It is the best by the way though, like if you're looking at it from your building a like a, a case to want to get away with something horrible and you need a great like alibi, a great persona to get away with it. There's nothing better than what he's designed to get away if he's this criminal cause you're like family guy. Yeah. It's like a mastermind criminal stuff. Really find that almost all the self righteous people who really like, look at all those pastors. Fucking assholes. Yeah. Hating gays and all this and look what a nightmare they were. Ted Haggard, same thing. The ones who preached the most and he would do that a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:34:56       He would lecture people, especially black people. He wasn't actually that much. Well that's, that's. I mean he made it into Eddie Murphy Raw. Remember he made it, made it into that space. Was delirious, delirious. Filled, delirious. I think it was delirious. I got a call from bill cosby. Clean up the bar. Yeah. Yeah. But how weird. How strange, but like what you were saying, you don't trust comics and we'll talk about their dicks. You don't trust people that they don't tell you the truth about how they feel about things. You know, what's, why the need to conceal either. There's a tremendous amount of shame. They're kind of bullshit, but that's how I am with people. I judge people like that because I'm eastern blocking and that's how we communicate in my family. Yeah. I don't. I don't know. But then, you know, I don't trust people that are overly nice.

Speaker 1:          01:35:48       Seinfeld, Seinfeld never give anybody a hard time about their act mean he's friends with Chris Rock, good friends. He's got this style of comedy that he enjoys, but he's also a master at it. You know, he's a master wordsmith. You know, it's like these, these, these, these jokes are like songs, you know, he's got them down to a science, but who knows. I don't think he's a darn. Oh, he's the exception to my, uh, my gross generalization about dudes who don't come from a different era, you know? Yep. I thought it was interesting with him was when he was getting a hard time recently about the PC adversity. Yeah. About. Well that was more recently have diversity on a show. Oh right. God Damn fucking coffee makes no, no. His new show. His comedians in cars. Yeah. Why can't he have his buddies on where they were saying, well, how come there's no diversity?

Speaker 1:          01:36:45       And he was like, I don't, I don't speak that language. I speak the language of funny, like if they're funny, I want them on. And people were listening to that explanation and I was listening to all these dummies, these fucking dummies that were commenting on it. They're like, that sounds racist to me. That sounds racist. I don't know what I heard, but I heard that sounds racist, but I don't know what he's saying. You know what I heard? I heard he's racist. I'm hearing people were upset about the same thing with Dave Grohl. He did that, um, sonic highways, hbo series where he went to, like cities that he found that that influenced him in some way would go and like find some like acts that were from there and then like, you know, a studio that he had been to or worked at coming up. And it was, it was really great. He went to all these different cities, you know, DC and Seattle, New York and all these cities along the way at every episode was focused on Wednesday and then people were like, how come you didn't have more women? Uh, or, you know, more diversity. And he was like, I just, it was a show about what influenced me where you grew up around white male musicians. That was his era.

Speaker 6:          01:37:56       That's, that's. And he did have women on there.

Speaker 5:          01:38:00       Not Enough. Yeah. Well, I told you I've been getting a hard time about not having enough black friends. I'm going to have a boards next week show everybody about. And they're not on the show on the podcast,

Speaker 6:          01:38:13       you know, I find, and I think it's upsetting to me. Did you see that thing and Rola heat by the way, take one email. There was some interview I read online where he said that there's so much censorship now. He's like, the Huffington post has succeeded in silencing. The comedians were also afraid of saying anything because we're afraid of being called a homophobe or a racist or this or that. And I think there's some validity to that. Especially with like Caitlyn Jenner, like on our show, I said, you know, we're just talking shit, you know, we're not, we're not a pc show and the, the emails, oh don't you dare and Blah Blah Blah. How can you be so insensitive? And it's like, you know what? Something can happen in the world and why can't I have fucked up feelings? You know what I want? Why do I have to be on board with the PC agenda straightaway? I, I'm all for her. Please don't get me wrong. Mazal Tov. Do what you want to do, but how come you know what I mean? Like we, I think we should also have somebody for people maybe of a different generation. Do you think my dad gives a fuck about Caitlyn Jenner and is going to be a sympathetic.

Speaker 5:          01:39:18       I, I have a theory about all this. I have a theory about all this like ultra sensitivity and ultra progressive thinking and it's, I, I feel like all of this stuff is very good and it's even though it kind of is against what I do for living as someone who talks a lot of shit about controversial issues, I think that what it is is blowback against racism or sexism or homophobia. It's just gone so far the other way that it's become preposterous and then it'll bounce out somewhere in the middle. Like what? I've been making fun of this whole Caitlin Jenner thing onstage and I don't want to reveal how I do it, but in the way that I do it, like I get people cheering. People have been cheering what I'm saying and it's not negative. It's not anti transgender. It's not like. But I think we have to remember who the fuck this guy was and who he was living with and what he was doing for the last 20 fucking years.

Speaker 5:          01:40:16       Yeah. Like, stop, stop with a. It doesn't matter if you are secretly a woman. What kind of a woman were you? A dumb cunt I secretly had dumped. Right? Because that's what I'm hearing. This is. This is what you're doing. You're still the same nonsense. Talking materialistic. Now you're changing your gender maniacs. Yes, because just simply by changing your gender, I want it so that it's irrelevant so that you change your gender. Have left or right back and forth. Go Mail, go female, go back and forth. What is the quality of what? What are your thoughts? Who are you when you express yourself? Because what I get out of you is nonsense. Not a single interesting thing all about me, me, me, me, me. I've always been a woman. I'm in this. I'm a dad, I'm a Mama, Mama, Ma a me, me, me, me, me.

Speaker 5:          01:41:07       It's you want fucking attention. Yeah, and this is one of the best ways to get attention. How about the fact that he goes from being on that show? I want to be him. I want to be referred to as a he. I want people still call me bruce, but the the 17 million people watching that show then immediately afterwards gets massive facial reconstructive surgery, becomes a woman, does this vanity fair thing and what is the. What is the number one? What is the number one thing that's happening? Attention, attention. That's the factor in all of this is a tension completely ignoring everyone. Completely ignoring the fact this fucking dummy killed somebody by not paying attention in his car, slammed into a woman, a real woman pushed her into traffic. She got head on, collided with a fucking Hummer of all cars. You get a hit with a God damn fake military vehicle, right?

Speaker 5:          01:41:59       I mean, and everyone is just sort of pushed that aside. What's important is we recognize gender and gender is a social construct. It's a dummy. It's a dummy dummy, dummy. Whether it's a male dummy or a female dummy. It's a dummy that doesn't pay attention and slams into your car from behind and pushes you into fucking traffic that no one's talking about. No one's talking about that and that happened like a month before. There's all it is. All we're hearing is the woes of being transgender and absolutely I get that, but like you know, Bailey, Jay is, she's transgender and looks like as close to a woman as you're ever going to get. I mean, God damn it mean if you don't want to believe. If you look at someone like her and you don't say, well, that probably is someone who was born in the wrong sex.

Speaker 5:          01:42:44       Look, look at her. Look at her. She's gorgeous. Beautiful. Yeah. She tricked the Shit Outta you thompson. Right? Like, look at that one on the far right with her in the Black Bra. Like, cheat. Come on. Yeah, come on. Get the fuck out of dodge. That's a God damn woman, right? Yeah. Alright. But she's interesting. She was on Opie and Anthony and she was talking about, you know, being born transgender and all the different. You're dealing with like a different quality of thinking, a different quality of human beings who just also happens to be transgender. Like I had a um, buck angel. He was great. It was great. Again, a guy who was born, a woman who really didn't feel like taking risks. I mean that guy does pornography and is really out there talking about heroic terms of glass without having balls. I mean for real, but, but again, it's the quality of the human being. It's like what? What do you do? What's going on inside your head as opposed to this nonsense existence that you've carved out for yourself? Well, and also the Amman, the automatic applause show business hero hero. Well, I don't like to

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       put that on her fucking instagram. I still haven't seen her yet. I got to grab her and throttle or here got a picture of Bruce Jenner into hero mode. Get out of here. There was also, they were celebrating online that like Seth Meyers, he makes me mad personally that, um, that after that was like, you know, I know this was like on his show was like, I don't have any joke about that and I'm just glad we can live. I'm just happy. Like we're living somewhere where we don't have to make a joke about that. Like people jokes may want to be pc. It's like, well that's so embarrassing, sort of language like a really like what you've done with your brand. It's like that same sort of fake. It's fake. It's a fake opinion. You don't think it's weird. You don't think it's weird that it's 65 years old.

Speaker 3:          01:44:40       You started to get a boob job and nothing looked. This weird thing of substance has come out of that stupid clan and the other thing is I feel like now the blowback is that people will criticize you and be really mean about it if you don't react the way they want you to react to any news that comes forth. In other words, this is what happened, so now the lynching has done to the person who goes like, I don't give a shit or, or that's fucking weird. Why is that? So now you're not allowed to react to it, right? You can't. You can't be confused about it or curious or maybe I'm scared. Maybe this is a new thing about the fact that it's terrifying to see a transgender. Like I used to live on Man's field between fountain in Santa Monica, it's Mecca, Mecca, Mecca.

Speaker 3:          01:45:34       For Travis and we would. I'm sorry. Oh my God. Let me tell you something. When you're walking up to your apartment at 1:30 in the morning and three trans gender prostitutes, transvestites, bisexual, whatever they are are walking up to you. You Shit your pants. Okay. It's fucking scary to see a dude or a woman. Six, three yoked shoulders and arms. And you see like a dude's face with hair. I fucking Shit my pants. I mean it was, we wouldn't be scared but. So are my roommates. Like we would walk up. What type of the Holy Shit scared when you saw it doesn't mean that you advocate want that guy. Right? And I'm not like, I don't want that guy to know where the woman did not live their life and then. But like why or how about like the idea that like, hey, this is what's going on with Caitlyn Jenner.

Speaker 3:          01:46:21       I don't give a shit. Why do I have to keep my shit? There's a lot of memories because I don't care if you're a man or a woman. I don't really care if you didn't do I judge you based on who you are as a human being and this bouncing back and forth. You could do it all you want. I don't give a fuck. Go and good for you. Is there something else there besides your gender, right? Yes. There's something else. Do you have something to say? Is there anything coming out of your mouth? What was winning the Olympics like? Yeah, that's fucking crazy. You're the greatest athlete

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       in the world. At one point in time. It was one of the baddest motherfuckers ever to do some shit that nobody does really gets me, gets my asshole twisted is when they do come back to the Canadians. Uh, and you know, listen, when, when in the history of ever has a comic advocated hate speech or violence towards. I don't know that they fake that. I mean, there was, there was a debate that Jim Norton got in with this woman was talking about rape jokes and comics qb on stage talking about rape and everyone's cheering. I'm like, look, stop. No one is. No one does that. That's not true. The only time a joke like you're talking about like bad comedy, maybe some would say a bad rape joke. The only time someone tells a joke and the word rape is involved as if it's funny. If rape is involved, like the idea that rape could never be funny.

Speaker 5:          01:47:41       You know? I mean it's not true. Things that unfortunately are funny. This conversation we'll definitely get misinterpreted because good he perfect people because people don't listen like exactly. They, they'll, they'll hear what they want to hear. They won't hear the fact that like nobody here is unaccepting or uncaring or advocating that somebody doesn't have a right to anything or hatred. They're just gonna hear what they want to hear in that and not allow you to have a different opinion on it. Exactly. And I think. But like I said, I think that all of this is good and even this extreme pc, because it's better than the opposite, the opposite is like being a fucking Nazi. The opposite is like killing people because they're Jews. The opposite is, is, is instead of being super sensitive is being completely insensitive. So I think ultimately like it's just swinging one way and I think what we're dealing with also, and this is the weird aspect of it, we all, we all agree on this.

Speaker 5:          01:48:37       There's a bunch of people that if you don't think the way they think they're fucking super mean to you, that yeah. So those are like people that are supposed to be progressive and kind and sensitive and less that you disagree with them. Then they're, then they're nasty and you see it in comedy. A lot of times among comedians were like the most progressive thinkers and ended up being like super bowl sometimes. There's not really progressive thinkers. They were. They're trying to do as they're mining the world, the world of ideas for love and acceptance and the moral high ground they're trying to find instead of like having this like nuanced objective point of view where they look at, okay, let's imagine what it would be like to be someone who wishes you were a woman. When you're a man. I, I can totally see that conversation being a fascinating conversation, but if you immediately say to me like, no, you have to call him a her now. No, you have to refer to him as his new name. No, you have to do this. No, you have the. What about debate? What about discussion? This is off discussion. This is off the table. Anything that's off the table is bullshit. You can't make fun of his bullshit. Yeah, that's true. And I would argue

Speaker 6:          01:49:47       even it's more dehumanizing to not tell jokes about Caitlyn Jenner because you are in effect saying, uh, I pity this creature so much. I can't make fun of her. She can't handle it. You're actually dehumanizing.

Speaker 5:          01:50:01       Seeing somebody. What's starting to be super sensitive customer visits. It's time to embrace the new norm. The new norm is we're not going to eat meat and we're not going to lift weights and we're not going to be aggressive and Kumbaya

Speaker 6:          01:50:14       bullying too. We've solved that problem. Right? If we just keep talking about it because my friend teaches in New York and she said they give the kids the riot act on bullying and school and then micro aggressions. Hilarious. Yeah. But then they get online, passive aggressive and then they go online and they cyberbully this shit out of each. It has to come out somewhere.

Speaker 5:          01:50:37       Come out somewhere. Well, not only that, bullying is negative and horrible as it is, as caused a lot of people to develop an idea of themselves that's rock solid. Like, you know, fuck you. I know what I like, fuck you. And then they go on and they do their own thing and then they become successful. Sure. By doing that it becomes motivation for sure. You know, like Chris Rock has a bit about Bill Gates and that if you don't have bullies, you don't get guys like Bill Gates, you know, because those guys get bullied and they run off and start giant businesses. There's some validity to that. Like I was bullied when I was young. It made me do. It made me fucking learn how to kick people's asses like this. Yeah. Both things. Yeah, yeah, but it made me go into martial arts is like, I don't want anybody to beat me up.

Speaker 5:          01:51:22       I'm scared. I'm scared all the time, so what do I need to do? Well, if I didn't do that, I would have never went. If someone didn't fuck with me, I would've never went into my bullying was very mild. It was mostly like fear and intimidation. That was anybody actually physically hurting me, but it made me go into martial arts and if I didn't do that, who the fuck knows what kind of a person I would have been if I didn't go through those challenges and the all the, the, the difficulties of martial arts. I would never be the same person I am now. Fear is a great motivator, dude. I, I remember anxiety of the best. They bused in a bunch of kids in my school from bad neighborhoods and I'm fucking scared of all of them and people getting beat up and fucking terrified and this one kid got me a headlock and threw me on the ground and the locker room and I was like 14.

Speaker 5:          01:52:06       I was like, I couldn't do anything to them. It was just so much stronger than me and I was like, fuck, I got to learn how to fight, and I remember thinking that like God damn it, like Jesus Christ. I'm terrified all the time. Like where is that guy over there? Oh, I've got to go around. You know that feeling, but that's doesn't new schools all the time and that fear was really prevalent for a lot of years. Go back now and look at those. Those are like formative moments, hundred percent. You understand human interaction and psychology and a very deep way because you understand the worst aspects of it. It's not good that those aspects exists, but those aspects exists in nature. They exist in. I have chickens and the the term pecking order. The reason why that that term exists because they fucking pack out each other.

Speaker 5:          01:52:52       They find out who's the baddest chicken. They and by the way it goes, it changes like the pecking order changes like chickens become brooders, which means like when they, they, for some reason they decide that this egg, even though there's no rooster, they had a bunch of lesbians, they decided that this egg is going to become a bird, so they sit on the egg and then they get crazy and they pull their feathers off and it's like a long cycle for them to figure out this egg is never going to become. It's kind of sad that this egg is never actually going to become a chicken. They're little tiny reptile brains just don't get it. So you have to take them out of there brooding stage and what you do is you put them, you isolate them in a small cage for a couple of days and you put them where they have to rest on the pole.

Speaker 5:          01:53:37       They have to stand on the pole, which is how they sleep anyway. The rest on like a little bar or something like that. That's just their words, you know. But anyway, when you take them out and you reintroduce them to the population, all the other chickens stopped fucking with them and just what animals do. That's how they motivate animals to not just be lazy fucks and sit around doing nothing. I mean it's. It's unfortunate. It feels weird. It's sad, but it's because why is it because because chickens have and become dolphins yet it's because chickens haven't become aliens. They haven't evolved to the point where they can read minds and fly through space. They're just chicken, this chicken fucking chickens and when the other chicken gets out of the box, you pick that fucker. Just that's what happens. We were watching the thing on gorillas and how that order so sophisticated.

Speaker 5:          01:54:24       It's so sophisticated and different from our society and there's a definite like there's a top dog and there's major like stepping up and finding out that you're not and then those guys do not fuck with that guy for awhile. Yeah. Primate psychology. It's very applicable to human beings and a lot of ways obviously we'd like to transcend that and I think the motivation and transcend that is the same motivation that leads people to, you know, to be more accepting and to be more open minded when it comes to things like racism or things like transgender rights or gay rights or any of those things. So ultimately I think these were all good. It's all good, but there's a lot of fakers out there. There's a lot of like fake progressive thinkers and fake sweet people that really what they're doing is just looking for an opportunity to be a cunt and when they see that you're not going along with the PC mindset, there are super aggressive towards you and when you see them, a lot of times they have fucking dyed blue hair and they're old morbidly obese and they're all fucked up. It's like, okay, you're. You're getting angry about something to take away from the fact that you're neglecting your very physical body. You're neglecting your life. You are. You're wallowing in some sort of depression and all of your success. Like what? What is it based on? What will your,

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       your, your success, your focus, you'll go to their twitter page. It's all like shitting on people who are not progressive thinking. Exactly. They love to low frequencies. There's people to that. Their whole charge, their emotional charge that they get is in being the a is in getting with that group to yell at the person like what did you say about that? And then they love to write the blog or the tweet or you know, whatever. Comment on a video. Yes. That there was this great tweet, Neal Brennan did remember, like a month ago, he goes, imagine how much funnier Richard prior had been if he had think pieces and blogs to guide to guide him. Yeah, that's, that's great pieces. What does it even mean? Fuck you masturbatory think and hide behind the computer to go, you know, and if you really feel that, stand up and say that in front of a live audience, why don't you get your fucking column if you go to the UC and pull it off, that's true. The right spot. Those poor folks that develop in those super alt rooms and then they actually try to go out to a real room somewhere on the road. I'm trying to make money and people looking. People in Minnesota go, wait, what the fuck are you joking around about? Yeah, you can be real safe and your development and it's not too good for you sanctimonious fuckheads. There's just so much of that going on. Either way. You mentioned little Jimmy Norton. We're doing a show with him on Friday.

Speaker 1:          01:57:14       Where were you guys are? Oh, oh, so you guys are teaming up while we were part of. They were doing a big festival. The DV. He like a. it's a big radio station. DV. He wd v I think is what it is and it's a Christina and I. Michael Che, Bill Crawford, and Jimmy Norton. Powerful. Yeah, that sounds good. Shawn just fly in early or do radio with them that morning. Then we say, well, he's a fucking warrior battling against this pc mentality, but he's also very open minded and super pro tranny. I got in a lot of ways, but he loves them, but I think that's worth noting in this discussion is that really I think all of us are pro all of these things. Yes. One hundred percent still be pro. These society evolving and have contradictory or whatever conflicting feelings are on it. Just. It's also like, just because you don't like one man doesn't mean you hate all the men were just because you think one transgender person is a fucking dumb ass doesn't mean you hate all of them or your trans phobic. Yeah. Like all this nonsense talk, you know, I dealt with all this ridiculous piece. You Shit when I was talking about that fighter that he is a man for 30 years, became a woman for two years, didn't disclose it, was beating the shit out of these women and one of the conversations that I had online, which was hilarious, one of the conversations was so hilarious and this woman's

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       was, was defending it, this super progressive woman with fucking pink hair and a big fat face. And she was like. She was like, she was always a man and I said even when she was always a woman rather, and I said even when she was having sex with a woman and got her pregnant and had a kid and her response was even then I was like, okay, we're done. Yeah, we're done. We're done. We're done. We can't do this is your. You're talking nonsense because you're focused on sex. That's not what this is about and not only that, you're talking about something in a way where you completely eliminate the possibility that you might be dealing with a crazy person like because because it's dealing, you're dealing with a progressive accepted thing where you have to put it in a box. You can never even consider the very realistic possibility that you might be dealing with someone who is not mentally sane.

Speaker 5:          01:59:32       Yeah. Right. Not Healthy and it whether or not they're transgender might be beside the point. I mean, you're talking about someone who pretended to be a natural born woman and didn't disclose it, didn't disclose something that might be pretty significant. We talked about it, that it was a medical issue. It's not a medical issue, medical issue that you have herpes, that's a medical issue. A gender issue is you have a man's bone structure and you want to fight women. That's. It's such a specific and unique case in this specific case where a man was like, I was, you know, not a man. I shouldn't. I was born in the wrong body. Comes a woman which has every right to do, but then with that man's frame in your hands and stuff, the fuck out of girls. Yeah, and brags about it and gloats and mean. It was. There was a lot of dark shit that was attached to that that people were conveniently ignoring because it didn't fit their pc agenda. It didn't fit there. This, this, this weird fucking like angle that they wanted to take. Very specific angle. Yeah. I don't know. It's fucking. It's a bit. It becomes one of those things where ultimately I think it's good. I think that this, the push towards pc is move towards pc. To me it, it, it, it signifies that people are becoming more sensitive

Speaker 6:          02:00:52       and I was thinking about this actually last week. Do you think that, I'm talking about the PC movement of the nineties where we renamed everything and everybody. Carlin had a great bit about this. They're not cripples their handicapable people aren't shell shocked. They have. Ptsd is a syndrome where we soften the language. We changed the way we use language. Do you think it really changed people's minds? Meaning do you think guys like our dads age really changed the way they thought about, for instance, women, if they can't call them bitches or broads or did it really changed how people thought that changed? Probably the people that were coming up. Right, but not the guy. Young people, but I mean, does it change the already

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       who grew up a certain way? Probably not. I think they look at it like the fuck are you talking about with that soft language shit. I mean, I know that like my dad's generation. Yeah. Your Dad's generation to people in power still right there. They look at that. Ptsd is like, you know, no, it's shell shock. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know, like PTSD, probably no different between that and shell shocked in a lot of people's minds because you're not, you know, not necessarily defining it in any different way, but the word cripple a hard to hear if your kid has an issue right now, if your kid's handicap. It wasn't always that way. That was just what we call them. Roosevelt was doctors used to say cold called people morons. Yeah. Mongoloid idiots was what they would call people that were born with down syndrome.

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       They called the Mongoloid idiots when they would write that on the birth certificate. Right. But that's what you. That's what you knew. It was just a word for something that meant the same. But do you think they reacted the same? Like do you think they were like, that's pretty harsh. Like didn't know what we know now and it's like. I think that's the idea about this move towards people being more sensitive. That's what I like about the move towards people will be more sensitive because I think it's forcing people to maybe reconsider the way they think about things. That's not a bad thing. That's not a bad thing. I think too soft and the language also takes the harshness of the thing like Carlin's point was, if it's not shell shock is what it sounds like. Shell shock, the guy has been back from war.

Speaker 1:          02:03:11       The posttraumatic stress disorder takes the Zang, the actual gravity and maybe if you called it something more aggressive because it is horrible to have this thing, but we soften the labels of things and there for soften the meaning of things and take away like the gravity of posttraumatic stress disorder is a weird one because that can apply to a lot of things. People that are involved in murders, like someone who was involved in violent crimes when they were young. That's stress cops. I think cops are the forgotten victims of posttraumatic stress disorder and people talk about why all these cops shooting people. Well, try being a fucking cop. Try being a cop for 10 years. Every day you're showing up five days a week, someone's lying to you and people shooting at you. You're dealing with the most horrific violence and let's be honest, most likely you got the job because you didn't have a whole lot of other options.

Speaker 1:          02:04:03       You know what I mean? There's A. There's a lot of people out there that are cops that are cops because they want to help because it seemed like a good thing to do because it's something they always wanted to be a part of. They always love law enforcement. Maybe they came from the military. Maybe they had a martial arts background. They felt like it was a good fit for them, but there's also a lot of people that are cops that are fucking morons and they're just like every other walk of life. Like a lot of people that are ice cream man are fucking idiots, you know, and a lot of people with ice cream and they have great jokes and the kids loved when they show up. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like you can't just. Nobody gets a blanket pass through whether you're a transgender, whether you're gay, whether you're straight, whether you're white, whether you're black, nobody gets a free ride.

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       You're you. If you really are not racist, who you really are not prejudiced in any way, judge people based on their individual merits and not just put them in a category and give them a fucking free pass because there is some form of minority, whether it's a minority because they're transgender or minority because they're gay or minority because they're whatever the fuck it is. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, I think, I think probably you don't know what you're getting into when you become a cop. Come on man. I have a couple friends and one of the that are cops and one of them was talking about working the graveyard shift and Vegas and just go into like the worst fucking and just, you know, chasing people on foot while while you're being shot at and just and, and dealing with the worst, the worst of the worst, which I've heard from multiple cops that there's nothing worse than a human being than pimps.

Speaker 1:          02:05:34       That they're just the most skills. Things that they're like, they're worse than murderers, man. That obviously they never listened to a too short record. What? Mack Daddy? Yeah. It's pretty, um, pimps, hoes down there. You deal, you do deal with pieces of shit all the time. But pimps, they're there. I mean, obviously they're taking advantage of very vulnerable people to stealing their money. Yeah. Exploding the fuck out of them. It's one of the reasons why prostitution should be legal. Prostitution was legal. Get rid of. You're not going to have more hose. Okay. They're just going to be going about it in a more legal way. More upfront way. It means you see there's girls that are just, that's just. And there's nothing wrong with it. If it's, if it's okay to give people massages, how come it's not okay to joke someone off?

Speaker 1:          02:06:20       Tom Can make money off of it. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Just clean up the fucking streets. Yeah. Get those nuts out. Everyone's got another. They got to get out. That's what I've been saying for fucking years and no one wants to listen. God, it dammit. It only wants to listen. I've been saying for years, this is the way to fix everything. Take that load pent up English except to short kills chicks with his nuts. Yeah. Allegedly it, you realize how much he was talking about nutting, like he doesn't get into the actual quantity, but if it killed her and might be just a forest, like if it's from the moon under your house and kill you. Right. That's an interesting theory. I think he blew her back. Right? Like it was like a fucking firehose. Could've been just a few cells are segways on this show. It was pretty serious moments ago.

Speaker 1:          02:07:15       Well we got a little upset about the PC thinking but yeah, but, but rational. But I think our point of view is pretty. It's pretty broad. You know, we're looking at it like no one here is anti gay, no one here is racist. No new at all. But we also recognize that there's a lot of like some Lou really shitty clunky thinking that's a part of this, this sort of progressive thinking movement. It was a lot of like really mean shitty human beings that are getting away with it because they've adopted this particular type of thinking that is acceptable. Bandwagoning that without thinking. Yeah, just and, and being insulting and shitty. Like I love going to like really super lefty progressive social justice warrior pages and watch how they're constantly just involved in fights constantly. They're just shitty human beings, mean shitty human. My favorite.

Speaker 1:          02:08:08       I've been to like a gun on my facebook page and seeing somebody's light me up about like a joke, you know, fucking piece of shit and Blah Blah Blah. And I go to their page and in their bio is like in Christ we are all one. It's all about love. I'm like, wow, that's, that's your bio. Then you are just like, lighten me up. And taught out there for a pimp. Hard man. It is. It's hard for people to figure it out. She choked on the come. She didn't choke to death, I don't think. What is it? A bus and nut and killed a bitch. It might sound sick. It might be petty, but you never got sucked by blow job betty. Now back in hold on. Killed earlier, so choked on sperm in her windpipe was on her face, her neck and chest. And we're sorry to say there's no suspects. When I saw that my brain click a button and killed a bit. So bad writing is dog shit. How dare you. How fucking terrible my boy said short. Don't worry. But that next day I read this story. How much cough drop syrup was he on? And then I then it's like, I love when they do this. They songs betty six times fading talking Bro.

Speaker 1:          02:09:31       Y'All niggas don't know though. So are people allowed to use the n word now that Obama said it on market? What's going on? My favorite was the stories for people that don't know, you know, he was using it to make a broader point, a broader point. He was talking about like, I don't want to misquote him, but it wasn't like he wasn't like, yeah Nigga we should go get something to drink after this. You know, he wasn't, he was talking. Yeah. So He um, but then somebody put together a list of presidents who have actually used that word. Use that word. Holy Shit. It was hilarious. Hilarious in that the actual. Yeah. Well, I haven't seen this, but I saw an article about like the, the abuse of the word by former presidents. Look at fucking Richard Nixon telling Rumsfeld. Um, what are you saying? I'm Richard Nixon. Obama's and the Dragon Gutter. Speak of

Speaker 5:          02:10:33       wrap by saying Nigger, he's not the first president it on tape. Que q clips of Richard Nixon telling Donald Rumsfeld our niggers are better than their niggers and Lda tape. Wow. LBJ observing, they're more nigger the voting than white folks. And that Johnson called the civil rights bill. The nigger bill. Like that's how he used it. Johnson was a piece of shit. I mean he was a horrible, horrible person. And if you believe Oliver Stone, he was the one who had jfk killed. Yeah. I don't know man. Well anyway. And also truman in his writings. Oh my Christ. Truman. Truman was like, really? Oh yeah man. In a different era though. It is, it is. It is only credits. Abraham Lincoln with freeing the slaves and rightly so. And the whole thing about him being a pioneer of civil rights, but he in, he was like very clear in one of his debates that he never felt like black people should be able to vote.

Speaker 5:          02:11:34       He never felt like they should be totally equal to white people. I mean, it's just like a lot of people, if you listened to way the way people thought of black people back then, a lot of white people that we automatically think of a civil rights pioneers or progressive, like the way people thought back then, it was very difficult to get away with any sort of equality talk then whether or not they did it because they wanted to win debates. Like, let me find it because it's. The Nixon quote is pretty fucking crazy. Did you say the n word? I did. I did. I was quoting one of our presidents. Well, a few of our presidents, there's been a bunch of them. Let me read this, this, uh, this Lincoln thing is fucking crazy though, man. It's, um, it's a very weird quote because you realize like the time people were around back then.

Speaker 5:          02:12:30       Okay, here I'm 18, 58. There was a series of debates with his opponents in the Illinois race for the US Senate, Stephen Douglas, who had accused him of supporting Negro equality in there for fourth debate at Charleston, Illinois. On September 18th, 18, 58. Nick Lincoln made his position clear. He says, I will say then that I am not, nor have I ever been, nor have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black racists. He began going on to say that he opposed blacks having the right to vote, to serve on juries, to hold office and to intermarry with whites. What he did believe that like all men, blacks had the right to improve their condition in society and to enjoy the fruits of their labor. In this way, they were equal to white men and for this reason slavery was inherently unjust, but thinking about fucking dark, but how a progressive is even that

Speaker 3:          02:13:32       in 1850, the fact that he's like, let's, let's make some form of you're. You're really right. Yeah. That's why you can't. We can't even frame our minds in a place where we really understand what it's like to be in 18, 58, you know, just, it's not even that. That has got to be crazy to more than half the population to hear at that time, you know? Well, especially the population of the south. They were like, what the fuck are you on? How about South Carolina? They're still fucking flying the confederate flag. They're trying to figure out whether they should tell you, figure it out when there's biology. There's bureaucratic bullshit in the way of something like that. Like what kind of world is it where you can be like, hey, let's just take that shit down. It's like we've got to get the assembly together. Vote on. Yeah, and it's like the hanks on vacation and Carol's not back either.

Speaker 3:          02:14:24       Like we got to get everybody organized before we can. Somebody can go up there and taste. Not Allowed and it's more like. It's like having the Nazi flag flying. I saw. Was it Andy Richter? It's about history. He tweeted and keep it in the museum about prices. I learned learning stuff about a twitter from twitter, but he tweeted that he didn't know and I didn't know either that that flag went up in Charleston in South Carolina in 1962 as a fuck you to the civil rights movement. So when you're saying like, no, it's southern pride, it's like, no, that went up on that building to say fucked civil rights. That kind of changes it. Years after slavery was abolished. Yes. We're totally convinced that's an extra fuck you. It's a huge extra fuck you. But then people, it's all the stuff we were talking about. It's like people, the reactions to Obama's use of it in and not hearing what he's saying.

Speaker 3:          02:15:22       Of course they're like, they're acting like he's just, you know, throwing it around casually. Like who's the least happy Mark Marin's old manager told him he never worked out. He got fucking president to say and I double g.dot g e r what kind of damage? I think that episode will get fucking trillion. It's probably going to break the Internet thinks more than Kim Kardashian's ass. It's going to be crazy. That's breaking the Internet. Yeah, it's probably going to get my. It'll be number one across the country for sure for a while and it I'd probably get millions and millions and millions of downloads. He set up another website for it. Did he really? Yeah, I saw that tweet, like, um, hey, if you're having trouble getting it here, I set up like mark meets. Obama is a whole other side, like photos czar. Yeah. Weird world we live in. It's fascinating though. I mean on a much smaller scale. Obviously the success that you and I have had all of us have had with podcasting is pretty. It's been very strange, you know, easy. We just shot a pilot because apoe test.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       Yeah, it's so crazy. But your show really should be some sort of a show and that's the best way to do it. I mean if someone was smart and they wanted to have a TV show based on your show and the interactions that you guys have with your fans and then going to shows it means it's a no brainer. I mean it's, it's guaranteed. I mean, if you get the Duggar's 19 fuck, they just like, fuck yeah, we like to fuck. And we treat our kids like my baby's weight active. We like to fuck. And we teach our kids nonsense. I think one of my kids, fuck one of my other kids, but I ain't paying attention is too many, but I say I say the, uh, the pilot thing that we shot in that like we never anticipated going into recording a show that like a production company in a network will be like, let's make a tea.

Speaker 1:          02:17:14       You know what I mean? Like we, we sit in our house and we just record the show and then, you know, the road has been so much better to us and it will evolve. Fucking podcast man. I mean, you're selling all these crazy places, but you know what ultimately is what's hilarious is the TV show is not going to mean shit that the Internet is what's gonna be. The podcast is the best part to what I did. Your podcasts, your podcast is fucking fun. It's really, really fun. It's funny. It's really fun. It's fun to do. And you guys have a down, you know, you guys have a groove and it's hilarious to listen to. It's a. it's a great, really entertaining thing. Way more entertaining than any fucking sitcoms way more entertaining than any talk show. There's not a Goddamn talk show on television that is entertaining as your podcast, but that's.

Speaker 1:          02:18:00       But that's true. I mean even if they take your show and put it on television, it's not going to be as good. It'll get more people to watch. It'll get more people to listen to the real thing and that's ultimately good, but the reality is your show is growing exponentially just by word of mouth. People were hearing about it. They spray. You can come on other people's podcasts, they talk about it and that's what's happening to all of us. Like there's this exponential thing that's going on when we do each other shows and then it builds up. It's like it, it, it juices us all up in some sort of a weird way. I think it's how is this going to change and eventually has to change television because if you get the real deal when you're listening to podcasts, how can you go and watch a TV show if it's not like a Netflix show hbo show, but most of them, this is what television is good for.

Speaker 1:          02:18:51       Game of thrones, house of cards, shows that are like productions madman. You produce, you're producing some. You have to have fucking cameras and writers and all this. That is still and that's actually a lot of ways better than films. There's a lot of films that can fulfill them away. TV for the last five, seven years has taken a colossal dump on a lot of film is a lot of film is really shit. Especially blockbusters. Did you see x Mokena? Yes. Was great, but that's rare. It's rare to come to come up with a film that gets produced and distributed out like, yeah, they're just rocks your world where you're like, whoa, that was fucking cool. I love that movie. I was like, that was on the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. The TV is doing that shit like weekly, weekly. They're putting out amazing, amazing content. Have you watched the new version of true detective? I just saw episode one. Yeah, I did too. And haven't gotten into it yet. I watched last season fucking end up fucking good. It's HBO. It's just knocking it out of the sun. Right. So good. But. So is Netflix to orange is the new black or wife is into that shit. Me Too. I've seen. I've seen everything and I rewatched them. I'm so into that damn show.

Speaker 1:          02:20:11       Billy birds doing a sitcom or not a sitcom. A cartoon based on his own life. Definitely Netflix. Fuck. Yeah. And his a Netflix special was giant for him. Just like your netflix specials. Fucking been giant for you. Yeah, it's been great to fuck dude. We live in a weird world. I know people will go and then like our people are tapped in with what we do. Everyone kind of knows but like it's funny, like I meet people and they're like, what if I've seen you on something? I'll be like a, like a show. No. This thing on Netflix and it's the people who are not in our kind of like, oh, okay, but then everybody who was kind of young kids young into it, they're like, oh yeah, of course. The all young kids, your parents say you can't watch any TV, but you have a laptop.

Speaker 1:          02:20:59       You sit, you sit in your room, your whole house houses, all Wifi. When you're online, you're watching movies. Parents don't know shit. They don't know shit. I mean that's the future. The future is Netflix and the future is. The only problem that I have with those things is that you can't download them onto your computer. Like if you go on a plane flying over China, it's a bummer. Why is that? Well, those, I don't know. I mean they said that like the speed that you can get on a plane just won't support streaming. You download it. They want you to have to go there for play, but they should also have an option, a download option just for the media, like on camping trips or some shit like that. I agree. I mean, I, I, sometimes we buy kind of marketing my dad to buy the, you buy on itunes all the time. I mean, uh, I watched that. Um, John Wick, you know that movie John? Well, I have that on my ipad.

I will bring a case of Caveman nitrogenated coffee. I'll have them send it to you to come into the new office. Dude. Fuck yeah. Brown new studio. And it's a very close to the old office. Uh, yes. What kind of an officer did you guys get? Jus Scout around or just. We did one of the first place we found is a great area. It's cool building like how many square feet? Not like 300. So it was like about the size of this room. Yeah. But sounds perfect. That's all you need.

Speaker 1:          02:24:20       That's all you need. Yeah. I have all this extra space. It's funny, I didn't know. Neither one of us knew what the um, like about like really what that looks like before we experienced it. So when you call and they're like, yeah, it's like, you know, 300 square feet. I'm like, what is that? A fucking closet. No idea. So I thought it was going to be like you open the door and then that's the back of the room and I was like, oh no, this is plenty of space. Like your college studio apartments. They're like, what are you looking for? I was like, I don't know. I don't know, like 1500 scripts. I had no idea looking at. I think this is what is this? Two thousand 500 something? Square feet. Everything you mean? Everything back. The garage. The whole front where the pool table. This is your car back yet?

Speaker 1:          02:25:00       Either way it gets back today. Oh, today at 8:00 PM. My Porsche does. Yeah. Yeah. The corvette still being worked on. Nice. Wait, the corvette is being like souped up more. I had a lot of shit done. Do you describe it? Yeah, I had. The interior was like a burgundy. I turned to black custom black interior. Are you excited to get the Porsche back baby? Yeah, that's my motherfucker. Yeah, that's the greatest car I've ever owned for sure by far. And you know, it's funny like I had it at the Improv. Somebody goes what years ago? Two thousand seven and the guy goes, why don't you get a new one? Get out of here. I understand what you're seeing, what you're seeing. You don't understand what you're talking about and understanding what you're saying. They don't make these anymore. Do you understand that? They don't make them like this anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:25:46       Fuck, but there's a certain year where you go back to it. They don't say that anymore. Like if you have a 19, 65 corvette bunch, get a new one. Nice. All right man. It's 50 years old. You fuck what you're saying? I'm excited because I just. I love car shopping and in about six months it's going to be sub time again. Oh Shit. What you're gonna get. I don't know. Come out and see my lexus. I have a lexus suv. The lx five 70. Like that. Drive around that thing man. It's like floating in the cloud. That car is just so quiet. That car relaxes me. I'm not bullshitting. It relaxes me when I drive it around. It's so soft. I was, I was in Atlanta and I rented a Tahoe and I was like, well I liked this full size shit. So then I test drove a Denali.

Speaker 1:          02:26:36       Oh, those are great new one. Oh yeah. Well those new cadillacs to, they have that. All those GM cars, they have this new magnetic ride suspension. Yeah. Yeah. This, these magnetics suspensions. They have like a circle variable suspension. So it kind of understands what's happening on the road. We live in. Weird, weird, weird times. I rented a little Volkswagen Beetle. No, no, around Denver. And uh, you know, you get so lazy because we got a car that beeps every time you get into the other lane and then jobs for you. And for you. That's crazy. That was killed myself. I got to turn my head to look back with the look. When you're backing up you have a backup cam. What kind of nonsense is that bullshit bullshit. Bullshit. No. Well, the new car is like, they have like lights that light up like on your lane, like if you're in the, if you're in one lane and if someone to your right, a light goes on, we have to let you know someone's over there.

Speaker 1:          02:27:33       It's just that they're there as they're passing. You can put the speedometer in the windshield, you have heads up display. Has the new corvette has that. It's insane. That new corvette. By the way, I've. I've made fun of corvettes in my act for a while because basically have like the guy that would get it right. You can go change. Yeah. And there were the dad boner that would just fuck it. Boner. But then you see the news and you're like, what? It's one of the best sports cars in the world. Yeah. Yeah. Cool looking. It handles insane. The interior is amazing and the speed is just gave you a monster monster on wheels. Yeah. Yeah. It's a crazy car. They finally figured out how to do it right. But there's a bunch of new cars that are crazy. The new American cars, the new [inaudible] 28 Camaro, Z, 28, 500, five horsepower faster around the ring.

Speaker 1:          02:28:24       That a porsche 9:11 turbo. That hellcat challenger. I drove one of those. How'd you like that? I loved it. Fun, right? Yeah. The Srt, they gave me one when I was in Denver when I was filling my special fuck. Yeah, they gave me one for the weekend. Come on. That's got to be a thrill address. So fun. Jamie was in poor bastard. Screams, right? It's got to be 700, seven horsepower. Great. Seven hundred and 70 horsepower from a car. They challenger charger too though. The four door charger, which is a fucking sacrilege. They turned a charger into a formula. That's crazy. It used to be the dukes of hazzard car, but that challenger. That's right. Forgot about that challenger could never have that today and that love that they give you. There's two separate keys and the red one. That means 700 horsepower and then if you want to dial it back, like if a friend or the valet, you give them the black and that.

Speaker 1:          02:29:13       That brings it down to like 500. Yeah, so it's not all the way opened up. You know, control how fast somebody can go based on the key, the amount of horsepower, horsepower. But it's so ridiculous because 505 horsepower is so fucking stupid fast. Yeah. It's like 700 horsepower is almost crazy. Oh no, sorry. They have that. It's the two keys and on top of that you can put valet with a code into the computer and your screen and that'll drop it down to like 2:30 or. Oh, that makes sense. There's like three. There's three ways you give them a Volkswagen engine. Give them that fucking beetle beetle can haul ass girl can run. Well. People do do horrible things that people's Valet cars. You hear about that shit all the time. Tara, can you imagine guy in Laguna beach crashed like a $500,000 Ferrari. They had some 18 year old Mexican kid who was driving who valet park cars because he was just.

Speaker 1:          02:30:10       He was just happen to Mexican and took it. So he didn't have any gang tattoos for many gangs. He didn't belong in there, so weird. And the he crashed into a fucking pole. He did not handle the car and went sideways. Have you seen that video of Eddie Griffin did crash in that Ferrari? That was a million dollar car. Oh, he crashed and Enzo into a fucking concrete wall. Those pylons. What are those things? Those concrete dividers? Yeah. What do you think he got out and was like my bad. Well, he said a brother, you know, brother can't drive. That's what he said. Oh, something like that. But, but the fact that they let him drive that car without knowing whether or not he could drive the guy who owned that car is a fucking moron. You know? I would've been like, whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.

Speaker 1:          02:30:52       Wait. First of all, do you not drive a car that you have you ever. What happens when it goes sideways and gas right? Brake. Left. Yeah. We good? Yeah, that's it. I've seen the. You've seen the video. It's horrible. It's horrible to watch because I think the car was totaled. He crushes that thing with front end. We didn't know how to stop, like he just didn't know what he's doing. He just tries to take like sometimes people just get so carried away with horsepower, they just don't know what the fuck to do. And then one of the best videos ever is, is this porsche nine slash six slash four RSR and it's in some sort of a rally and as they're coming around the toe hits the same thing, but it launches into the air and goes flying into a river like right in front of all these people pull. Pull this video up. Porsche our nine slash 11 rsr crash. It's the most ridiculous crash. You gotta see this crash because this is a race. So you think like if you're racing a car, you know how to drive a car, right? Yeah. This is not necessarily. He just had. It could be just some rich fuckhead. Look at this. Look at this car. Wash us. Where's the volume? Hold on,

Speaker 7:          02:31:57       stop.

Speaker 1:          02:32:01       Oh my play that again please. It's going sideways around the corner, but off the gas that anytime now

Speaker 1:          02:32:12       he didn't even turn. No fucking moron. I got this. Look at this, look at this. It's going size. Is that uh, first of all, his line sucks. I mean he kinda goes left a little bit to go right. Passenger racing too, right? Where you like the guys with you, you think he was like, hey, hey, look at the wheels come home. I think those upside. Meanwhile they fixed it. They fixed that car and they put her right back on the road. Really? Yup. Not even totaled because it really, when you watch him hit the way he hit and slammed on the brakes, he tried to kind of just fucked up the suspension. Like, watch it again, like, watch. He hits it, breaks, boom. Hits it. But you see the wheel comes off the frame seems okay. Yeah. Boom. Lambs, little water damage. Those cars are bulletproof.

Speaker 1:          02:32:58       They're so solid German engineering, but it's just. I mean, you would think a guy in a fucking race would probably know how to drive a regular car. Advanced driver. Yeah. Usually guy's a moron. Or was for that brief moment. Maybe you had a seizure, maybe. Yeah. Maybe we were just being assholes. That's true. Yeah. It had the feet feature stop working. No. Have you had to Fart? Like break? Break hold. I'd be as friend far today. Glued Griffin. Poor bastard. I'm seeing him at long time seeing him in a long time. No. See what store I used to. I was banned from the store. Oh. Years ago. I left the store. I can't get them to go offstage. Eddie will go on stage at nine and close it out at 3:00 in the morning. Not cool, Bro. Not Cool. Ridiculous. Don't we hate that? Yeah. Well it's.

Speaker 1:          02:33:51       It's weird. I know he's on that tour. That tour going on right now is like. Yeah, it's like him. George Lopez. I'm a black brown or black or brown tour. Yeah, they're doing like fucking huge venues. Yeah. Powerful. Yeah. Do it for him. What are we doing that? Let's do it. Set it up. It's fucking. Make something happen. Huh? Huh? Let's do it. What are we doing? What does that. The Omega Man. What's up? What is it? Oh Man. Some black shit. Oh, you don't even know. I just didn't know. It's fraternity. Careful. Come on. What if the people that are the Alphas are mad at you? That was in the prison. You were in prison? Yeah, man, I have all the tat. So would you guys be interested in getting at your mom's house tattoo? I'm going to pass now. I know for my son. Why? How about uh, why an m and an h all together in one big cluster? Fuck, no.

Speaker 1:          02:34:42       I have one tattoo for the nineties and I, I'm not that person. I'm not good. Some startup or some kid came up with a um, a cream that instead of like laser takes your tattoo ink completely off. Really? Apparently. See if you can find that Jamie. But apparently it works, you know, it was like shark tank or something like that. Yeah. Apparently the tattoo a. what's it called? Do they invest in them? I know very little about this. Okay. Just talking. I researched it before I brought it out to them. Well, no, that's cool. I watched that show. Sometimes I get into it, but I heard some people talking about and they were super excited about it. Shark tank, I don't like when they over rehearse their pitches though, like I know they're nervous because they're on now, but we found no better way to eat jello and is like this.

Speaker 1:          02:35:26       He was so nervous and scared as a performer. Empathy for them. But some of them are amazing at their level of bullshit, like their, their pitch, you know, they'll come on and they'd be like, well, so what are your sales like? Real strong really good numbers. And then they'll throw out something that like, you can verify that I could probably get it to you. Like they're just like making shit up, you know? Wow. Fake it til you make it. Yeah. It's a big party going on there. Like for like a lotto ticket, you know? So what have you guys written down while you've been here? Because we have your pads. We're going to eventually take all these pads and people scribble and write things down. We're going to frame them. Really put them up. Yeah. David chose her all Dick's show. Everything was dixon come come home.

Speaker 1:          02:36:10       Hmm. Hmm. I read an interview with Matt Lauer that when the beginning, we were talking about that lay, the white lady that. Oh yeah, that was so disappointed that she didn't talk blacker. Shouldn't talk black at all. When she did get. That would have been really funny. Well, you know what I'm saying like that would have been great. This going to be some video of her talking like that especially went back when she was saying that she was black. She got busted. That I don't know if that post is even real of her. Like a facebook and she could go in with the all natural look and it was all curled, which means that she just got a perm. She was really shit straight. Yeah. She posted like going with the all natural look like I think it's real. They said it was a real facebook. They all natural for other people or other people.

Speaker 1:          02:36:55       Well, there's a lot of people. It shows you how we did this. This whole progressive movement is that a lot of people have adopted this whole trans racial identity thing that you. You should be allowed to be trans racial and people were saying that racism or that race, that race is just a social construct, so you should be able to be translated out there out of fucking horrible. I think it's adorable. I really do. I never saw this coming. I mean because what we called politically correct we were talking about in the nineties, that ain't shit compared to this because now people have formed their entire identities based on this type of thinking. You know this, this agenda, this, whatever the word would be that you would fit into the whole narrative that they've adopted. It's, it's, it's adorable because it's really, it's simple minds, trans racial, not onboard.

Speaker 1:          02:37:51       I am on board. I'm in. I always wanted to be Japanese either. The funny thing is that you are, all you have to do is say you are in, you are there. It is all natural because I started my 36 years. That is hilarious. So to her credit she looks good. I mean she does pass good, but she's pretty in that picture, but the picture is not so pretty. Her 36 year. So a couple of years ago. Yeah. That one on. So pretty. It's a weave. Is she say it's a we've. Oh, she does. Does she say it to? We've. Yes. It's a we've. Well, because you are. I'm hearing Tanya a grocery store or anywhere else I would be like, it's none of your business. Finally, after brief pause, she says it's a we've. Hmm. Kinky curls and dreadlocks come from. Okay. But that was a different look.

Speaker 1:          02:38:41       That's not that look. That was when she had the crazy dreadlocks that a lot of skin tone. I mean she's orange is the new black. Did you see, by the way, did he got arrested? He got arrested for swinging a Kettlebell strength and conditioning coach at Ucla when I heard this. Don't Miss Pussy. He's a mace. You can't be. If you're going to assault someone, steal clubs or macy's or the way to go kettlebells and awkward thing swinging around. He would have connected with that though. He'd be like, he'd be up on murder charges. Especially hit the guy in the head like a watermelon. It's attempted assault with a deadly weapon. Charge them all terrorism. Yeah, Jesus, yeah, he's in, he's probably fucked right now. Right. I mean he's out on like $50,000 bail. But like I, I think, you know, those charges could easily.

Speaker 1:          02:39:28       I've read an article so you know, it's not like I was there, I don't know firsthand account, but it looks like a pretty serious assault charge man. And what it was it the guy was yelling at his son, his son apparently. What's, that's actually chicklet the Kiddos in the first star wars. He got arrested. What is that about? It's just on this page. This is. Oh, different things. They said that, that um, did he son hasn't been there for all the workouts and was like giving minimal effort at this strength condition. How weird. Sound seems strange. So spoiled kids try harder. I heard very motivated coach lit him up and then they were. Then the coach was on the phone and he did, he went into his office and the coach was like, I'll be with you like in a second.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       And he came in and apparently it, it escalated there. He, he hit him is what the article I read said that he punched the strength and conditioning coach. They finally got him out of that office and then I guess they were next to the weight room or something and an intern. One of the people restraining them got a few people, got them in there and he grabbed the Kettlebell and swung it at an intern. Whoa. Yeah, so it wasn't even that cold. Who knows if that's really. Who knows if we're just talking shit. I heard John Jules came down and they guided his hand and they brought it to the Kettlebell and he swung for Jesus. Do you realize what angel did it? Which one? He's right there. Biggie. Yeah. Whoa, right. Biggie was on the shoulder, right? Like an angel. What if he says that biggie picked up that kettle bell.

Speaker 3:          02:40:56       Biggest one that swung it for him. It's a good defense, right? Fucking goof balls, miss too. If going to swing the Kettlebell, hit somebody with you. Fuck, I'd stick it right up his ass. If he missed you. Fuck you. Trying to hit me with a Kettlebell. Can't stop, won't stop. Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop but missed. Yeah. Reality. Stranger than fiction. Can't hit no hit. That's a fucking mean. If you're swinging a Kettlebell at someone. Oh my God. Trying to really, really fucking choose that as a weapon. You give a fuck. I couldn't even pick it up. We're going to be really hard to get any real speed when you can actually hit them. But if they're there, when you do hit them, fuck. Someone's holding them in place and then you think about what you could even do what you could do with like, especially one that's really actually not that heavy.

Speaker 3:          02:41:44       You know, grabbed like a man. God really? You could. You could fucking kill someone for sure. Yeah. Not much of a workout tool, but. No. But yeah, you could really hurt someone. Just fucking shows come full circle. Really. Has guys got to you? Do you guys fart in front of each other every day? All Day. That's all that happens. Let's seems weird. We don't make Brown in front of the brow. We definitely don't make Brown kid. My cousin was like, when he was dating, his wife were, we were, we lived together and she and I, you know, she spent the night at my place and we go in, my cousin's sitting there in the bathroom shitting and his girlfriend's eating a Bagel in the bathroom. She's like, yeah, so afterwards the fuck is wrong with you. And he was like, what? Like I neither one of them that and he's like, I'm taking a shit no in the best part is you. And I would watch, shut the door, do a full conversation. But he took like fucking baby shits, you know, he's this little guy and like there would be no noise. I think it's just kind of a good introductory. Yeah. Like you didn't remember what matters though, Babe. He's still dumping. Listen, I have a five year old and she takes logs. She drops, shine, fucking huge water bottle. Thick logs. Wait, is that the oldest

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       or the youngest? The youngest is five now. Wow Man. Crazy. You got to come over. See them. See the little people the fucking size? Yep. Check you for weeks. I haven't seen the movie wild man five. She was like, I haven't seen them in a minute too. It's been a while. And your oldest seven, she's a crazy world making people, making people were going to join you. Get me strange. Excited about it. Very excited. Very excited. It's weird, right? Ambitious. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to get your shit together for sure. I'm excited. I really am really, really excited. You don't have to get a new tailor. You're going to be fucking running around like a maniac. Drop a lot of weight. Yeah. It's crazy. It's surreal to think that I'm growing a life inside of me right now as we're talking about killing girls with cum loads, talking about the digital footprint this kid's going to have to your kids study, dad.

Speaker 1:          02:44:13       Holy Shit. What about when you said this dad? Whoa. We just fucking around. It's called the podcast plus I was high. Don't get high kids. They'll get out. You'll be like your dad and come up with all those funny jokes. Enjoy movies and food better. Don't do that. Your Kid's funny. Are they funny? Claris? Yeah. Both of them are really funny. They're ridiculous. We talk about that sometimes like this. It could be funny. Oh, for sure. They will. They they grow up in that environment with. Yeah. I think there's two ways to be funny. Just be suppressed someone and they explode when they get away from you, you know, or the opposite. You encourage it all the time. Just constantly laughs. It's an environment of it. They know how to. They know how to make and they repeat stuff when it's funny to try it again. See, it doesn't work. You keep trying to get. You got to come up with new funny thing, right? He was like, I can't think of anything. I'm like, that's how it works. That's interesting. Yeah. There's two highly inappropriate people with boundary issues. It's going to be weird because we're both like, I don't have a filter. You're more, you, you're capable of acting civilized, but I fear that I'm not. Your kids will. They were bell by becoming an accountant. That's what we talk about.

Speaker 1:          02:45:23       Like when the kid is like, you know, 11 or something like having friends over and he's like, dude, could you please not do your fucking joke around shit. Like that's true, right? Come on. God Damn it. Dad. Did you know son, son, come here in our farm now it's going to be so many far. It's in our house and so much brown Brown. Do you like by the time your kid becomes like 17, 18 years old? Imagine how fucking strange the world is going to be there. We can't. We can't imagine. We can't imagine it though. I mean how different the world is. I'm 39 and I look at like millennials in the audience and I look at them and I just go like the world I grew up in, I was born in 76

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       is radically different than the world. Millennials grew up in cell phone. I didn't have that until I graduated from college. I didn't send an email until I was in the work force. That's why your friend had a makeup pitstop every hour. Talked to her dad, right? I'm here. No one has been. Fuck, I need to wipe again. This very leaky. Today. That girl talked about taking the bar, how to describe it, how did she describe it? That she'd like rationalize it. She knows completely rational to her the argument because it's such a cultural thing, at least amongst her friends. That is what you did. But from what I understand, that's a great question. And I wish I would have asked that at 13. I didn't have the wherewithal. Do they? Um, did she talk about like, oh, Christina feels so good. I should do. She didn't like it. I know. She personally. It was just a necessity. It was basically like you. That's what you gotta do? Yeah. Wow. Isn't that weird? That it doesn't feel good. She doesn't like it. But you have to do it because you like boys. But what do you like about boys? Fuck y'all.

Speaker 4:          02:47:21       I mean at least if the boys are putting it in your vagina and you, it feels good in your vagina, then you like sex, but you don't even like the sec. But you have to do it because what? She liked the boys that were the attention. But sexing her, but she didn't. She could only but sex. So that was the one outlet and that's the compromise of it, I guess to get to hang out with a boy. But the first time she ever got one in the actual cooter she's probably like. And then that guy was easier than what?

Speaker 4:          02:47:54       For a while I am pure. Don't worry about it. Oh, what a weird thing. The religious principles when it comes to bug fucking, it's sad. It makes me sad that she had to, but sex instead of just having the sex she wanted was getting fucked in America. Get buffed really sad, but fuck. While the Talibans were watching, getting buck, buck, buck, buck the right place, get a fucking lawyer free. You're free to get bud fucked or not. How? Bob? That you could always become a Christian and you can do whatever you want, not really worse things and getting fucked in America right now, there's a lot worse. And get back to your own fucking country sucks. How about not getting butt fucked and Iran. Persia. By the way, there is no persia. Cheese, adorable, adorable. That they'd start calling it that after the Iranian hostage crisis. The Jimmy Carter thing is that when they went back to when they started doing Persian, because I had an Iranian girlfriend when I was like seven, eight. And how has the bud sex

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       or too little when she was really my friend show you're calling my girlfriend and she was my friend, but her mother tried to stab her father. She was half Iranian and half white. Her Dad was white. Well, you know, they're both white colors, whatever. He was an eastern Europe, whatever the fuck he was United States navy, normal white person type shit. And um, the, the, the wife tried to stab the, the father while, uh, while I was friends with her and he said this really weird, crazy situation. Like I really wish I remembered more of it, but I really liked her. She was sweet. She was very pretty too. And uh, she was really nice little girl. We're both the same age. I think we went to school together hard for me to remember. I was living in San Francisco at the time. So it's probably like eight and uh, there was like this big issue, which was like my mother, my father and the police came and yeah, imagine that, you know, mother was old school from Iran. She just was ready to kill a guy. I could understand that. Ready to kill a motherfucker, whatever you'd like, I'll make you feel better. Just spread your ass hole up. And she's like, enough with that. But sex.

Speaker 1:          02:50:17       But she had like gone after him. I don't know if she, I don't remember if she cut him or God, I don't remember what happened, but it was cops were involved and it was pretty significant. I think that the little girl might have had to stay over my house for awhile. It's hard. It's hard for me to remember. She, I spent the night over my house were cops were there. It was a big deal though because I remember my parents being freaked out. We were freaked out, you know, um, as someone who's a, you know, with Phil Harmon, I've experienced the actual act getting done, you know, his wife actually killed them. When you know somebody like that is when you see shit like that about people trying to kill people, you know people that loved each other, made a child and it got. It went so far, so far gone. Someone pulled out a metal blade and went after somebody. Tom's Dick, or do you have an erection right now? Someone in farted while they were getting stabbed better,

Speaker 3:          02:51:12       I'm getting. I'm getting a little bit of weight in there now. This little thing, a little blood flow. Keep talking. She cried and he listened. He watches all exclusively wife murder shows on the dvr. It's like, it's like, what are you doing? Crime? You're doing research? Yes. Forty eight wife murdered. He enjoys the wife. Of course. I watched a lot of crimes or alleged crimes, crime stuff I've always liked. I liked the stories, you know, I like it. I'm so excited about telling him the stories. I mean, usually I've always loved like thriller films. You know what I liked. I just liked that genre of like something happens and then someone's got to solve the case of where I was like that. So I look at it as just a story. It's a crime story, which I've always like. She's like, oh, I can check it off to the like, well, because it's a lot like you got.

Speaker 3:          02:52:08       I'm fascinated by it. No, no. You've got most evil. That was the most evil. What does that. Most evil has a forensic psychologist who has interviewed the worst of the worst, uh, specializes in like, you know, serial killers. And they basically have a scale of from one to 22 that ranks how evil a person is based on their acts. And so what's 22? Twenty two is a torture murderer. Who? Btk Killer? He's 22. Yeah. Ask him mother killers. He, he knows the game. Like baseball players, you cards mid lamps. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know because I haven't seen him profiled on the, on the episode. But you know, when you, when they get off on the torture aspect, you know, especially if it's like sexually getting off on that, that thrilled. They're usually the highest ranking one. So all the. Everybody who tortures is pretty, pretty nice.

Speaker 3:          02:53:06       Gentlemen, who are psychopathic, torture, murderers, murderers, you think they judge 22 people. Which guy is dead? Mom. Hello? Oh, Henry Lee. Lucas. Yeah. He lied a lot about things. So he did and they didn't know, but they, I mean they at least in the profile said that like the best. I'm the best was like, I think it was, it was lucas or another guy who they, he always killed and then had sex. So they would go like a, hey, why did you. He said the cops who interviewed him at the time was now talking about it, you know, I asked him why he killed this girl and he goes, you know, to have sex with her. And then by like the fifth time I would add, I would say like, so why did you kill this other girl, Sharon? And that the guy was like, I said, to have sex with it.

Speaker 3:          02:53:57       Like he was annoyed that they kept asking him that. Uh, yeah, dude, that's why I kill them. Jesus, what is your problem? Yeah, I don't like those shows. You know, why? Because I think I get it. I think I get it, you know, like I think I'm pretty aware I've seen enough of those and I've seen enough documentaries. I know people can be really fucked up part, but I don't like to concentrate all that all the time because then I'll just be fucking paranoid and weirded out and ready to go to war. Everywhere I go. I, I don't watch it all the time, but I do watch it when I'm jerking off. Everyone's got to come or that's my whole thing. We're at a time. All right. We did three hours. Holy Shit. I have another podcast to holy shit doing Jay Hawks podcast tonight. Oh, cool. Tell him I said what's up? You know him peripherally. I don't know him personally.
