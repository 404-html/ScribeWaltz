Speaker 1:          00:00:06       The Joe Rogan experience podcast. Full charges here. Can you type in and not look at the screen? Yeah. I took a typing class in high school. Had no idea I was going to pay off. So huge. I can barely do it. I kind of do it. My mom was a receptionist. I can type it runs in the bloodline. Crazy, bro. You got skills to pay the bills. Even if this comedy thing doesn't work out, I can still type like a Kelly girl. Fuck. That's amazing. That's amazing. I wish that was still a thing. So full motherfucking child. It's good to be here on a special day. Good to. Good to be here with your brother. Um, comedy store tonight. Oh yeah. My first set of the comedy store in seven years. I went there the other night. It was just too much fun. It's great. I got to go back.

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       It's not the same sadness that it turned into when you left. No, it's way more upbeat. It's crazy. The management's great. Everybody's like all professional and everything. Like a in that show they do that roast battle show. Holy Shit. Is that, that might be one of the best shows like for an audience member to attend in La. It's fun. It's so fun. It's so well done. All those dudes that are in the. Well this week there were terrorism guys and some weeks there are black guys. What do they call the Negro Wave League? What do they call it? Oh my gosh. Watkins who's also the host of the desk bod pod podcast. Thunderpussy is a hilarious comic on, you know, in his own right, but he's a part of this little group that during the roast battle when our joke does really well, they run on stage and do these crazy antics and the terrorist guys joke murdered.

Speaker 1:          00:01:47       It just murdered and they ran on stage and they water boarded to dude. They threw a towel over his mouth. Poured water in his mouth. I mean cause like, you know what it's like when when someone kills with a bit shit. And this is a small room where we saw this is in the belly room. The comments to which might hold 100 people if you stuffed to the gills. That might've been 100 people in there that night. Hanging out the window is everything. I mean, people would just see just crammed into this fucking spot. And uh, we had a great fucking time. We really had a good time. I saw Joe joke over so well one time and the Negro wave league, there was one white guy and they threw all this paper on the ground at first, just kind of for the sketch started and they start picking it up and his cotton face because it's white guy starts whipping them all. Oh my God, they got a whites only section that says racist shit. Totally Racist Shit. And is a sign on their table that says whites only really good and you know, it's just fucking good. And Brian Moses who hosts it, he's fucking funny, man. Funny. And he's great at that Gig. It's reminiscent of eight mile and the whole the MC battles and he's very MCI

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       for whatever that guy's name. You know what I like to that he says, Hey, at the end of it all, we hug it out. Yeah. You know, I liked them. Not like it comes, the whole thing comes off like what it is. It's a joke writing contest. Did you know that if two white guys go head to head that they're allowed to say the n word once each? I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They allowed to allow me to put their phones in a basket when they go into that because someday someone's going to be on stage and the people that are like on fucking whatever, you know, super progressive blog that gets US radio. I'm sure Brian said something about it the other night. He goes, listen, if you get easily offended, get the fuck outta here. What happened on a blog? Somebody wrote about like, you know the n the n word is thrown around a lot in that room from the whites only from the black guys, from the judges, from the all Negro wave crew.

Speaker 2:          00:03:55       They say it a lot and who is the was somebody went home and blogged about it. Really? Yeah. As that's how it goes down now. Los Angeles, the comedy store giving white comics as you're saying, it's gotten more professional at the comedy store, but that's so far old school that way. It's so funny that someone, first of all, it's someone just doesn't get what they're doing at a place like the comedy store in a show like the roast battle, like the whole point of the thing is pushing it over the top way over the top in the most ridiculous unrealistic. No one's actually saying that it's almost the white section is almost progress. The whole thing is pretty much progress in a lot of ways, which is one of the reasons why Hinchcliffe fucking loves it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       It's fucking great. Love it. Great God damn show. So I went there for that and then I went there for red taping of his show and it was just too fun. I was like, I got to come back. It just doesn't seem like what I was running from the old school vibe is there again, like just, I don't know, it's just really cool. It's like Swanky, classy and, but kinda dirty and down and out at the same time. There's just no place like that and I felt it when I was there. I was like, this place, there's something, you know, it used to be Ciro's nightclub in the 19 whatevers, the early, the Bugsy Siegel owned it and the story that we always heard from everybody there was at taunted and that a bunch of people had been killed there and they say there's a sniper point in the green room looking down on them and well there is not a sniper point, but there's a small window.

Speaker 2:          00:05:31       But apparently it was like with Jerry Lewis wanted, like Jerry Lewis wanted to watch the opening act so you could, I guess know where they're at so he could get nervous, you know, she can get a view, see how everything's going right now. Like in case they didn't have cell phones, it couldn't tech somebody, uh, you know, it's, this fucking crowd sucks at Dick. He couldn't just, no way to let each other know. You couldn't call. Hey, just to let you know, there's a guy, a drunk guy in the front row. And so I guess he just would watch the opening or maybe he's, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       he's insecure you opening. Yeah, exactly. There's kinds of tell you to take it down a notch. I've got guys on the road like a work with guys and the guys tell him, dude, you're going a little too hard down. Yeah, I've, I've had people tell me not to do certain jokes really, that, that really didn't kill their jokes. You know what I mean? Well, well, well did they tell you not to do it? Like I was just starting out and I had this closer and it was very hip hop oriented and this guy and he's awesome comic. I won't even say who it is because I think he's awesome. But he was like, Hey, I got one hip hop joke so you can't throw it. And it really hurt me at the time because it's all I really had, you know. But that's life. That doesn't, that doesn't seem too bad.

Speaker 1:          00:06:40       Oh, that's a tricky one man. You know, I've worked with guys before and they were opening for me and they touch on the same subject that I'm going to touch on later and so unless you already been doing a bit and then the dude does it and he's opening for you and then it's Kinda like you're paying someone to trip you up, you know, you can. That can, that can be argued, I guess. Yeah, we maybe it was, it didn't harm is bit. You said, no way. This guy is way too funny to have anything I say harm them, but there's just like a maybe a paranoia or something there, you know, maybe. I don't know. I was telling Brian earlier, it's like all the road trick is just to go, hey, Brian was talking about this earlier and then you do your fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       That is, that's all you have to do. Real. Yeah. That's the road trick. Yeah. And that's a great way to segue into it. We don't pretend that it wasn't already discussed exactly 40 minutes ago where the subject wasn't. Yeah. The, you know, Brian Cowen had a, an interaction with a guy on the road once and it was, it was real weird because I was on Brian's side because Brian's a great friend, but I was also not on the side, you know, it's hard. He worked with some guy and the guy opened for him and the guy apparently in the course of like his bombing, like he wasn't doing so well, he started talking to the crowd and like telling the crowd just some shit that whatever, just something about like the way they were reacting or the way the show is going to be for the rest of it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       It was some non funny thing. We were just talking to them and Brian Goes, what are you doing? Like why, why are you just talking to them? And he goes, hey man, that's my time on stage. He's like, no, you're opening up for me and you weird. And the whole crowd out. He just like started bombing. Then he started talking about comedy or talking about why they're not laughing at you or whatever the fuck it was. I don't remember specifically, but I remember thinking like, man, I kind of see both sides part like the guy sucked, right? It wasn't doing well, but we all sucked at one point in time. Like how do you not suck? And that's also how you get past sucking is to go. All right, jokes are off the table. I'm just going to talk like a regular human being now.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Sort of maybe your jokes are not funny about. I mean there's a bunch of things that you do, but you know, it's weird when a guy tells you not to do something, it is in you. Just like, oh, I don't know, like the only thing that I could see. It's like what I said earlier, I'd say if you have your bit about uh, the Dolphin bit, like if you had a guy who went on before you who also did like a super similar bit about having sex with something like really similar, you know, like a monkey or something like that. Something smart, you know, you can be like super trippy. Like it would trip you up. Meaning, you know, like if you went up and did your bid, the whole premise has been kind of beaten down even if it's a different. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:09:31       Yeah. And that's my dolphin bed actually started as a sex type joke about having sex with a dolphin and then now it's nine

Speaker 1:          00:09:37       has nothing to do with sex, with adults. Isn't that interesting how that happens? It's like when you come up with a bit like it starts off as like a seed and then from there it goes off and sometimes like just a tag line becomes a totally different branch that becomes a totally different tree and, and a lot of the lines come from our eating didn't get a laugh at first and then you're trying to save it and then you're on a totally different page in. There's just some weirdness in the room. You went left when you should've went right and a new line just pops into your head. Absolutely. Whatever weird reason. That's why I like the act of comedy, like creating comedy is so it's so complicated. There's no, no one exactly knows where all that shit's coming from. It seems like the only consistent thing that seems to work for me, because you just got to do a ton of sets.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       Yeah, it's about. It's about doing it because like you can sit there and memorize your bit and you're like, it's got to go exactly like this. You do it exactly like that. It doesn't go over that well. Then you start talking, you start riffing and all of a sudden all this stuff you just made up on the spot is way funnier, way funnier. Sometimes you need the audience there. Dick Sandwich sign. Sometimes it's Dick and poop on bread. Yeah. And you just gotta eat it. You got to eat it like you like it. So it's kind of get that. Brian was saying, Hey, this guy's bombing out the crowd before my, my set. But then I kinda get that this guy is, you know, he's just doing a shit. That's why I take guys I know with me on the road. Absolutely way I know. I know what already does. Doesn't know what Brian does. I know what you know. We know what everybody does and it's funny. So you get to enjoy it, like I like enjoying the worst is when you don't like your guy and you're working with them and then they laugh at him and you're like, what happened to this guy?

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       Or it's like, yeah, it's like if they liked this shit, are they going to like la? But even if they do, you're like, I don't even like you guys saw what you liked the like awfulness.

Speaker 3:          00:11:25       One thing that we ran into I last week in Toronto is all there. People were really funny but like getting people that you don't know thrown up in front of you, you know, because it could go really bad and it could go really good, you know? Luckily there was a lot of funny people in Toronto, but you know, we did this one show and this one guy who opened it up did 10 minutes opening. He was only supposed to do five and it was some of the worst comedy you ever. It's one of those words that guy's screaming at the eye, right? Right. Guys.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       Like, like trying to make them say yes, you're right. All right, that's fun. You know, homeboys in a panic. Was it angry? It was just loud, loud in just inexperienced and just like the audience just sat there and watched him, but he was like trying to get them like, no, you have to respond, respond, you know, it was bullying, bullying, bullying. Well you know what it is, man. It's just misguided energy. He's just trying to get a result and it's just not happening. So he thinks that he's just really big. Like people will like watch some standup and they go, oh, I know how to make it. I know how to do it. Sure. I'm going to do with Kevin Hart's House. I'm just going to do that kind of thing and we'll just literally try to emulate. But Kevin Hart's funny is his funny. He knows how to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       Funny. Like if you try to do that funny it could fuck you up. And definitely it'll definitely like sort of hide what ever real funny is inside of you. You'll be trying to be Dane Cook. You'll be trying to be Steve Byrne, you know, whoever it is that you think is funny. And when you do that, man, it can really fuck with your head. Absolutely. It takes so many years. It takes longer and comedy than anything else. Right. Neurosurgery is probably weird. Comedy, I think. I think a bunch of things you do quicker than or they would take a way longer time than being able to get a laugh consistently. You're right about that, but doesn't it take most guys like three years to even be somewhat funny? Sometimes. Some didn't really funny out of the gate, like with her a couple of years. Like it depends on how much alcoholics anonymous they've had up in front of those people and talk.

Speaker 1:          00:13:22       How about substitute teaching? They've done, do we have guy back in Boston? A rest his soul. He's passed since. But his name is Dave Fitzgerald. And it was a funny guy, man. And he fucking. He learned how to do stand up completely from a do an alcoholics anonymous speeches. He was a guy who like was longstanding drunk, you know, and then got his shit together. Started doing stand up at these meetings. Started telling us stories and the stories were fucking hilarious. His stories of excess and just had a great delivery and timing. Yeah. That fucking guy was a solid professional like inside of a year. Nice. He just, for whatever reason, like we were all like marveling at him. Like the guy used to be a drunk, but look at how organized he is, you know, he's constantly performing and networking and he got sick. I don't know whatever happened to the guy but something, some cancer or something.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       He died. A couple of guys from Boston were really funny. Died of cancer, but this guy, my point being that he did something else, like if you do something else, like some guys like uh, like your buddy was in bands. I'm Dean Delray, Dean del. Right, right. And like being on stage all the time and being in bands. He had a point about that. It's like kind of understand what it's like to be on stage so that, that part of it is not as difficult. Right. Yeah. I mean he jumped into it pretty quick, you know what I mean? He started, I don't know, like five, six years ago, but he had been in a band for 25 years and he toured with some of some major acts. Yeah. Uh, so yeah, he, he, I mean I used to do open mic him at the beginning

Speaker 2:          00:14:51       and he jumped right into it. Well, they've got to get him on. He's got some funny stories. I saw him on his podcast. It was really funny because he's toured with bands for what, like decades, right? He's got a story. We'll go to the Dama rare one. He's got a student, don't go to it now, but I mean if people listening to this go to the dom irrera podcasts and he's got the story about, I think it's Joe Walsh shitting his pants on stage. They put waiters on because they were gonna fire him. Like he really did have diarrhea, but he was such a mess. He was constantly missing shows and Shit. So they were like, dude, if you do this, they're going to fucking sue you like you, you got to perform. So he put fishing waders on it. Just shit his pants while he was onstage and it's, it's dean.

Speaker 2:          00:15:32       Dean does a great job telling the story. It's really, really fucking funny and it's a good podcast. So Dom irrera has a live from the laugh factory with dom irrera and can't say enough things about dom. Check it out. Shit. I love that guy. He's just so classic. He's the man. He's so classic. He was always funny and in, you know, when he's at his best in situations like Thunderpussy, you know, like when he was judging Thunderpussy Oh my God, he's a murderer. He killed Tony. Tony. Oh, United States on diversity yet you don't judge thunderpussy killed Tony, you know the, the one with the cliffs obviously. But he's so fucking funny on it. The one he and I did, it was just so good. He's such a cool, like I love a classic standup comic book that with the attitude and the authority and just the jokes and the whole deal, the whole deal, the whole deal just loved that car.

Speaker 2:          00:16:20       So, uh, you know, I saw him the other day to joey was there the other day at the comedy store too. It just felt great. It felt great to just be there. It's weird. I was watching the uh, I was watching the youtubes last night with you fight and hosting the show tonight. That would be hilarious. I almost asked you should ask. I think if that would've been, it would've been the funny shit of all time and say yet I was actually on that show that night. I opened up the show that you really have 2007. It was a 2007, I believe it was February or something. Yeah. I still have the seven page letter that crazy sent me from the comedy store. So did you get in trouble with the comedy store after that? A little bit or something like that. What exactly did they say?

Speaker 2:          00:17:07       It's a long story. A guy behind it is gone. Gotcha. It's all, it's different there. I went there the other night too, man. And when he was filming a special, I plopped myself down next to polly and I almost shit myself because people were like, dude, go look inside this room right now. And I look over and I'm like, what? Joe? And polly's sitting there talking, well I looked at him like, I don't have a problem with this dude. Go be friendly with this dude. I just sat down next time I shook his hand and we had a nice little conversation. We have a nice little conversation about how happy he was that he was doing the special in the original room. Really cool. And I was like, yeah, I mean it's a classic room and you know. And Paula was like, yeah. And he's so comfortable here. Like he was a nice little conversation we had. So it was good. Yeah, he's very. A poly is very matured now. It seems like the more I lately

Speaker 1:          00:17:52       I think it's totally unfair to judge, judge, judge anybody based on who they were. And then you kind of know who they are. But to say that that's who you are that defines you right now in this current moment. It's pretty unfair, so I, I try not to do it as much as possible, but there's, you know, there's obviously exceptions like Ted Bundy was out. I'd probably have to kill. I'm sure. You know what I'm saying? Like the certain dudes like you can't get away with what you can't cut women's pussies out and put them on your head and some things you can't shake on photos and then you get out of jail. And then I'm gonna yeah, you did that in the past. We're going to judge you on that. We're going to hold you to that which is going to end it for you.

Speaker 1:          00:18:27       But, but you know, there's, there's people that you become enemies with that. It's almost like getting a pattern of remaining their enemy. So it's like, and that was never enemies with poly entries had been been CEO. Never really enemies with poly. But you get into this sort of a thing where it's, this is just what we do. You know, we can't just let it go. Like I fucking hate that fucking guy. What he tried to do to me and fucking this and that. And then he turned around when the shit goes on for like years and years where you think the echoes of one conversation or the echoes of one interaction can remain with you for your whole life just because you choose it, that person remains your enemy. You put so much vested interest in energy into it's a complete waste. And if you can just, whenever you have like these little conflicts with people just as many times as possible, resolve them.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       Absolutely. You'd be amazed at the psychic weight that's lifted off your soul when you do that. I think you're in a really negative space every time you think about that. Totally. Yeah, totally. Yeah. People that you have, like there's. There's some conflict in life that it's unnecessarily necessary. You know, it's necessary, but it's unnecessary in the sense that if we were all living in Utopia, if we all had our shit together, if everybody was cool and balanced, it wouldn't be taking place. But the vast majority of conflict wouldn't be taken place. Because if you really think about how many people there are on earth and think about how little actual conflict or is everybody was always wants to dwell on the horrible aspects of our current existence. They won't get Iraq and Afghanistan and murder and crime and a woman walked down New York City Street for 10 hours and all she got was met at wanted to fuck her.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       You know, I understand that. That's an issue. I do understand. Look, I have daughters. I have a mom. I don't want anybody feeling harassed by a bunch of apes shares because some dudes like, Yo, Yo, I got some. I got a picture on my wall. I think I've told, talked about it before, but it's for like 1951. It's an American woman in uh, in Italy and she's walking down the street. Have you ever seen it? It's a classic image of it's huge picture and it's these guys from like 1940 or whatever the fuck it is. And they're holding a dick. Say, hey, with this fucking broad, oh, I ripped us congee, Lo va with a fucking piece of this. And this is like, I used to think that people were like fucking father knows best back then. Well, you know, I, I heard that. I mean obviously those guys actually acted like that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:05       But I read that that photo was somewhat staged in that they did a couple takes of it. No. And they knew they were going to get the picture. They knew they were going to get it. Dude, that's reality TV. And in 1951 or whatever it was, what year is it, Brian? Does it say I'd love that picture. She knew the photographers and they set that up kind of. I mean, even though they're actually really a boss yelling at her, those are really, that's real. That's my people. That's my ancestors. Savaging monkey folk. They're savage monkey folk. I'm allowed to say that because I'm Italian. I'm glad that I'm Italian because I could shit on an Italian behavior. Some Italian behavior. Nineteen 51 and 51 and their animals look at them. But Tony Hinchcliffe, you know the woman walking down the streets in New York, some of it they should've just not left in the video because it really fuck with their point because some of it was like, God bless you.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       Beautiful Day. You look beautiful. Some of them, I mean, come on, people meet each other. What they, what, what bothered me a lot, which is one guy who stood next to her and kept walking with. That guy was a creep. Yeah, because a piece of shit. There was a couple of guys that were real legit piece of shit and that I think should have been highlighted in that video that these guys are out there and that a girl could get, you know, your wife, your girl, your mom stuck next to some asshole who's creeping on her. That was real. But you know, hey, beautiful.

Speaker 3:          00:22:31       Bless you. I got a lot of shit because I said I just tweeted that video when it came out and I said, God, this has to be annoying. Because I was thinking if it was me just trying to walk down the street for me, that would drive me crazy. Just be able to high five the dues and keep walking, stick their penis inside you and ejaculate. I don't want any interaction with people that I don't know. How great would it be? What are you doing? Why are you doing shows and why you're doing a podcast show because these people know me more than anyone telling me no. In real life. You wouldn't like to walk down the street and have girls try to fuck you all day long. No. Hold up. These people know you more than anybody in real life. You mean people listen to the podcast. People that listen to the podcast know me more than like my friends back home in Ohio. Well, they listen to the podcast or my sister because these people know hours and hours and years and years of almost a biography of all this is the last place you want people to judge you on. This podcast is literally

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       last place on earth, right? You should have like, this is basically me, like someone like a smash house made a compilation of you, like if you're confused as to who Brian is, watch this. Those

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       guys are walking down the street that has to be running at you. Asking questions. Hey, do you believe in evolution wire black Dick. So much more delicious. Brian didn't take it. Take it. This is how I am. If I were to imagine my sister walking down the street and this happened to my sister nonstop, I would be pissed off if all these guys are pretty much just like, you know like hawks in a wounded animal, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:24:11       Well some of them, but some of them were like, Hey, beautiful. I like she would walk by, Hey, beautiful. Right? And here's something that someone told me online them I read this. Someone was saying that they have a friend who's a girl who's from South America and in South America. Women like it. Yeah, we will be upset if they made cat calls the illegal what? Girls like it when they walk down the street and guys talk,

Speaker 3:          00:24:36       Hey baby, what's up baby? Because their butts or swallow, they're wanting to make it

Speaker 1:          00:24:41       in estrus. I'm not. I don't think that's the issue. I think the issue is that they, it's a different culture and that our culture is becoming hypersensitive, acutely aware of sexual assault and rape and they, they connect every single act of. I won't even say aggression, but like enthusiastic courting, like on the street, like even an unrealistic like Yo baby won't come park that shit on my face.

Speaker 3:          00:25:10       Is that ever worked ever backed up and just planted her ass on dude's face when he said that? Probably. Yeah. No it works though. Probably as your horn honk every. That's how my parents met. You could honk your horn, you could yell out the window. All that stuff is valid. Do you remember checks out? Do you remember? Like a year ago I told you that I was trying an experiment where I would add lights out, like honk the horn and be like hey, what's up? What's up kitty? And like talk to people and cars and it was really uncomfortable to do what would happen and it really was girl just sitting there like, don't look, don't look over. And that's what I feel like that, you know, like even if you say, Hey, beautiful, hey, beautiful girls are like, come on man. Like, like, leave me alone. I'm just trying to walk for the most part. I, most girls, the reality of being a woman, but don't women, uh, accept or love aggressiveness on some level. Maybe like a subtle aggressive because they don't like to do that. That's not guys they liked though women, I

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       can appreciate a certain amount of aggression from a person that they like and trust, but a certain amount of aggression like that kind of an aggression. Sure. The average person, obviously there's going to be with women and no one likes to say this. There's going to be women that have rape fantasies. There's men who have rape fantasies. Men who have rape fantasies of them being raped. There's everybody, there's. Everybody has their own kink share now. So there are some people that have like, maybe they have fantasies, like have you ever see that? Louis ck jokes got a great joke about that, about how we made out with this girl

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       and tried to push it and she said no. And so he stopped and then the next day she's like, what happened last night? And he said what? And she goes, I thought you were just going to go for it. And he's like, what the fuck are you talking about? She was like, I was hoping you were just going to go for it. He goes, what do you think I'm going to take a chance on the off chance that you're into it. I'd be really into rape. It's a really funny bit, but it's like there are. Those people do exist. Absolutely. But that said, the majority of women don't want to be cat called when they walked on the street. But this. There's a difference between like some of what we saw on that video and some of what you're just going to get when you pass by a group of men.

Speaker 2:          00:27:20       Right. You know there's going to be a group of men that go, God damn, even if they don't look at you, if you're hot and you walked by men, they'll go cheat us is what is that? Is that. Is that cat calling? Is that bad? I don't know. But if you're wearing a fucking tiny miniskirt that's just clinging to your ass and you have high heels on and you smelled like the nectar of the Gods and you're walking past a group of men and there's more than two guys. Yeah, we're going to curse. One guy is probably gonna. Keep talking about shut. Yeah. There's something that happens when we get in packs of apes where it's almost like if you get over it exponentially gets more likely that someone's going to say something or three almost. And a lot of it is men trying to make each other laugh.

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       You know? A lot of it is not even like trying to pick up the girl. It's certainly not being considered the girl's feelings, but a lot of is like, Jesus, what I would do to that, you know, and people fall down laughing or we make each other laugh, but there's a victim in that column. We're to feel like shit. I just curse quietly to myself. I can't help. I'm just gonna come kind of like that. That's quieter. Yeah. You know, just go Jesus Christ, but it's in A. I know it's positive, but I keep it to myself because I don't like to make people feel uncomfortable. Yeah. Problem is, isn't like there's five or six guys around. That's when it gets uncomfortable and that's what you saw. Like even like two or three when you saw, when you saw like a lot of what she's getting catcalled it was dudes like almost making each other laugh as they were doing it as like passing the comedy store on sunset.

Speaker 2:          00:28:53       If you're, you know, all the comics are sitting there on the patio. Anytime a girl walks by like a mini dress. It's just kind of what did you just do? You're going to do social justice warriors going to be out on sunset, going to strap a camera to the most attractive woman. They could find the best. The best looking one is passed back and forth. Nothing. That's a game show or that show right there. Just go back and forth at the comedy. We should make a show called I'm offended and just get offended at virtually everything. You see the fucking latest thing. I tweeted this today, and this is. This is not bullshit. This is actually real. There is a Portland, Oregon teacher that is against peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because she says they're inherently racist. That's peanut butter and jelly getting along post. Okay. Peanut butter and Jelly Racist

Speaker 1:          00:29:43       Portland school principal tie sandwich to white privilege. This is where we are, ladies and gentlemen in 2000 and fucking 14. They're saying black people can't afford it. Oh Man, I don't even. I mean, I don't know why my trash isn't it? Peanut butter and Jelly. Okay. Super White. What about Somali or Hispanic students who might not eat sandwiches? You? Tara says according to the Tribune. Another way would be to say Americans eat peanut butter and jelly. Do you have anything like that? Let me tell you. Maybe they eat torta or Peta. Ugh, what the fuck is going on? What the fuck is going on in this country? For Real? It's just a god peanut butter and Jelly Sandwich. There's not even any meat in it. You can't even get Vegan pissed. I really think that what's. I mean, this is going to sound completely crazy, but I really think that what's going on when we're becoming more and more hypersensitive and more and more aware of like these little things that don't mean a goddamn thing and focusing on them and spending all this energy while you have this finite amount of time in life.

Speaker 1:          00:30:46       I think people, especially as we get older, our fucking terrified of death were terrified of death, of death, of the planet, of death, of our children, death of our friend's death, of our loved ones, and as it, as things move on, we concentrate more and more a nonsensical minutia more and more on Pulse Shit, more stupidity and it just, it gets more and more ridiculous and even intelligent people if that's the creepiest thing about these social justice warrior folks that are just. Some of them are just completely out to lunch on some shit, but one of the things about them is they're almost all well read, almost all articulate, almost all intelligent be at the beginning completely roped up and this nonsense like wha, what do they call outs and the doxing and they're just spending all their time online going after perceived slights and some of it is legit. Like this bill cosby Shit, right? That's legit, but some of it is like peanut butter and Jelly. Fucking sandwiches are racist. Like, Oh, what? What are you doing? You're an adult. Couldn't be any less important. You're not even an issue. You're making up an issue now. I think you're right. You're, you're definitely avoiding your more complicated thoughts when you start bringing trivia into your fucking brain. Complete total trivia and I also think that.

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       I think it's just super bad for your brain. It's super bad for your brain to concentrate too much on. Well, especially if especially if it's making you angry because then you're just sitting in a chair anger, angry, and it's like you need to use that energy in other ways. You know? I mean, it's just that basic primal like ready to fight feeling, but you're just sitting in a chair. You don't put that energy anywhere, so it's bad for your body to. I've been paying attention to a lot of people's twitters lately, like watching people that get into consistent twitter, twitter wars, and you just look at them. You're like this person sleeping four hours a night madness. It's the whole lifestyle. They're fighting with strangers too. There's a lot of people that are like living in front of the computer saying shit, waiting for someone to respond and then saying something back.

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       Like sometimes it's a tweet, something mean to me, I'll just go to their site and see what they do and it's like all mean tweets to to other people, to everybody responds and they always have about 13 followers and you just gotTa let it go. Even if you have a good comeback, you got to let it go. Otherwise you're in a twitter fight in public. I don't care if they have hundreds of thousands of followers. It's still the same thing. What do you. What are you doing? You know, like it's, it's one thing if there's something legitimate, if there's something legitimate, vast majority of these discussions. Have you paid any attention to Gamer Gate? You know what Gamergate is? What's said about fucking completely baffled. Yeah. I backed out like I did when those things were. I walked in and he's like, yeah, yeah, well I definitely care, but I think it's, it's so confusing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       There's so many sides to it for this is the idea behind it. The idea is ethics in journalism on one side, that's what they're saying. Ethics in game journalism and the other side is saying it's really about harassing women and that this, this woman who they initially went after, like, uh, like, you know, who gives a shit and what's the big deal and she's just a game designer. Apparently she slept with some guy's. I'm butchering this story. I've heard a little bit about this, the worst part of it, the absolute worst part, but was all the death threats and all the negative people speak. This is feminist chick and Anna, I think analysts are keys. Anything thunder foot as a bunch of hilarious videos on her, but whatever's her, her idea is that she's trying to promote gender, not just um, I wouldn't say like equality and gains, but she just wants to discourage stereotypes and she wants cheese showing that there's some aspects of video games that show women as objects like, you know, like the fucking what is the vice grand theft auto, grand theft auto game.

Speaker 1:          00:34:35       There's a lot of bad shit. Well, I don't think she's necessarily saying censor it. I think she wants people to be aware of it. You know, and again, I'm trying to be super open minded on all this stuff, but the worst aspects of it for sure, or the death threats, sure, but this is where it gets really crazy. Some people believe this is the conspiracy theory. Of course, some people believe that some of these in fact death threats or some of these threats aren't real. That what they're doing is trying to discredit the gamergate movement by making it out. That there are all these massages and creeps, so then these other people that are involved in Gamergate started this thing calling not your Hashtag, not your shield and it's all people of color or women. All these people who support ethics in game journalism who think this whole issue is getting sort of misconstrued and distorted and twisted, but it's so.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       It's so convoluted and multi-sided. I think both sides have some sort of a point for sure, but I don't want an involved like deeply in video games, but I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to discourage this extreme left from taking over from controlling the narrative from like saying that all video gamers are misogynists. All video gamers are assholes and I think for a lot of these guys, they're super socially awkward. Yeah. A lot of video gamers, they, you know, they're, they're online all the time, like it's a big percentage of their social life. I know this because I used to be in a fucking quake clan and I used to hang out with these dudes, like we used to get together and have land parties. I had dudes come over my house man when I was on TV. Yeah, I met dudes online.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       Yeah. They all came over to my house and we had a fucking land party, you know, I was a super dork. I used to make my own computers. I would go down to fry's electronics and buy a motherboard and a case. Fuck yeah. Put the ad. The hard drives, the whole deal. My friend Andrew would talk me through it when shit would go bad, but for the most part I kind of figured it out. Andrew, who developed my website? Yeah, menthol. Yeah. Fucking jumpers. Jumpers, like one little jumper could make the whole computer work or not work. It's like a Christmas light. And this was guys that were like, there were like overclocking. They went over clock. They would get these, these, uh, these cpas that weren't as strong like the seller. Ron's memory, those celeron processors. You can get a 300 Celeron and you could jack that sucker up to like four, 25 and guys would put like extra fans and shit and he'd blow cold air on it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       Yeah. They were just trying to like. And so I was involved in this culture. Like this is not, I'm not talking out of my ass when I talk about these guys. And for a lot of these guys, they're, they're very, they're very sexually inexperienced. Some of them, you know, some of them are there shut-ins a lot of ways. They don't go out and they don't, they don't meet a lot in. So like this idea that they're, you know, objectifying women in these, in these video games, I see your point, but if you look at the people that are watching these things and playing these games, if you really want to think, I don't, I don't think you can make a real argument that it's affecting their behavior and making them go out and assault and rape and others. They're very shy. People that aren't aggressive in the least.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       I don't mean that's a huge. I mean that's a huge generalization. Obviously I've made a generalization, but I think that it becomes an issue of you can be a really good person who doesn't have any malice towards any sex, any gender, any orientation. A huge could be just non-racist, normal, cool person and enjoy playing some fucking crazy game. We will, you a, you can smack a girl. You know, there's a game when you're in a fight and you're shooting guns at people and you know, every now and then a girl comes out, you screaming at a time the pimp slap swatter, right? And then you get a 10, like 10 shows up, like you can really catch her perfect with the pimp. Slap this. Not a real person. I know. It's no, it'd be terrible to actually slap a woman in the face. It would be terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       One of the worst things you could do, but I really think that you can do that game where you can slap a cartoon, women in the face and you're not a bad person. I mean, could it. Because it's fantasy. It's just like when you watch a movie, like think of any number of movies that have, have horrible scenes where women get beat up. Or how about that fucking. I'm the Quentin Tarantino movie. True Romance. Perfect example. That was um, James James Gandolfini and applegate, our cat, our cat. Patricia Arquette, right? Yeah. Fuck too. It's tough to watch. Oh my God. It's tough to watch. He beats the shit out of her and she eventually kills them. Yeah, but I mean he's beating the shit out of it and you're watching it, man. You're watching this fucking movie. Are you controlling it? No, but you're watching a movie that's depicting a horrific scene that could possibly happen now.

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       I guess you could say that it's different if you're playing a game because then you're an objector. You have an objective, you know you're. You're accomplishing something, and if this is a part of your objective is that you get to slap girls. I could see how that could be kind of fucked up, but all of it is fantasy. I know. And if you're a good person, I think the real issue is how much to games or any media for that matter, how much they actually affect the way we behave and how much of it is how our parents raised us and the environment that we lived in. The actual real human friendships that we had. How much of is that? All I know is I've smacked the girl in the video game but never in real life and I and I don't intend to, and that real life, unless it girl smacked you really fucking hard and really got your Irish up.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       My Irish ego driven this flash. Hm. Um, yeah. Look, that was the argument when that dude knocked the girl out in the elevator. What was his name? The football player, Shawn Ray Rice Ray Rice, who uh, his girlfriend cracked him or his fiance, whatever she is. And then he left, hooked her and knocked her unconscious. Wow. Yeah. It's fucked up. But is he right handed? It doesn't matter because it was a short left hook because very good punch punch. But the point being like, yeah, absolutely. It's way fucked up to knock someone out. That's your wife or you know, anybody like that. Especially a woman. Like you couldn't control her in some other way. However, she shouldn't have had him either. Right? She shouldn't have hit him and no one's saying she shouldn't have hit him saying, hey, you crazy bitch. Why'd you hit ray rice? It's almost like because of what he did to her in response to what she did, she doesn't get blamed for what she did.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       Right. So if there was a video where she just punched him in the face in an elevator and then they left, do you think there would be this giant outrage where everybody was like ray rice got assaulted by his wife? That woman is a terrible person. She needs to be in jail with. Is it based? Is it the action I've seen this is the action or is it based on how much damage you actually do with what you've, what your action is? You know what I'm saying? Like if this woman is hitting this guy and then he smacks her in the face. This is, take this off. I don't want to watch a shit. Um, what, but, but look, both people did the same thing. It's just one person was better at it and one person actually started, right? I mean, yeah, it's more fucked up because he's a powerful man.

Speaker 1:          00:41:53       He's a professional athlete. He obviously knocked completely unconscious. It, a whole lot of brain trauma there. She could have died all the about me. She fucking clanged her head off. That bar handlebars was playing. I mean, she was out. Do was one of the worst knockouts. I've seen it. I've seen a lot of people get knocked out. That was a bad doc out, but no one is saying she's a bad person for hitting him. Yeah. I haven't heard it once, but yeah, but it's not cool. No, that's what. No one's supposed to hit anybody. Yeah. Right. And you definitely shouldn't hit a fucking super athlete and a small space. I wouldn't do that. I mean, Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's not good that he hit her for sure. But you're also dealing with dudes. You know, I talked to Michael Irvin about this once and Michael Irvin works with a lot of young kids that are coming up that um, you know, have been in impoverished situations growing up and they've had a lot of violence in the family and he was saying that your body just gets when you're young, especially when you're going through the womb, when your mother is going through a tremendous amount of stress, your body gets almost designed to react instantaneously and make poor choices like your body almost as response just so shellshocked that your body's designed to like it's set up to deal with the trauma of a bad neighborhood really.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       And it's based on when you're still in the womb. So based on the stress that your mother experienced as well, she's got you in her womb, Jesus Christ, crazy shit. And so you make worse decisions based on that. You, you follow your instincts, follow your instincts. You become more aggressive and violent and more aggressive and violent. A lot of times leads to poor thinking, poor, poor planning. And you know, he was saying that this is what a lot of these guys are dealing with a lot of these nfl players, but a lot of young athletes, it's like they were literally program different than people that grew up in a nice house with a nice family, nice environment. Like they're literally hardwired in a different way because your brain thinks, okay, well this is the game we're playing. We're not playing pokemon. We're going to go ahead and we're going to play fucking aliens vs Predator and I'm low on armor and it's best to act quick before you're in trouble.

Speaker 1:          00:43:54       Yeah. So when you see a guy like ray rice clock, a chick like that, literally that guy might not even be able to control that kind of a thing. Right? I'm not giving him a free pass at all. What he did was totally fucked up. I would've never done it. But when you're dealing with head trauma, major head trauma, that guy has been hit who knows how many times throughout high school, College. And in the pros, I mean he has collided with some giant men. Yeah, there is a hundred percent likelihood of head trauma going on there. One hundred percent percent. Then you punch him, you know, and who knows

Speaker 2:          00:44:33       how much control he has over that switch. You would like to say, well me Matt, the full charge, I have full control of my situation, but I don't claim to know what it's like to operate his body and mind. I definitely don't. Or hers. Why did she punch him? I wouldn't have praised them. Bitch woman. Crazy. I don't know. I mean who knows? Maybe he did something but we didn't see before that, but it's just craziness and should be avoided at all costs and definitely don't get married to somebody that that happened with the to the fence or unless you really both don't ever do it again. I mean, is that possible? Again? Can people grow and learn and so this, this is beyond say sister is the head. This was no, so it doesn't really different story. You son of a bitch, you're racist. He's a totally different groups of black people. Say sister started hitting Jay Z. Okay. Yeah, that's what I thought. Who knows what? Yeah, I get it. Mixed. Jay Z just dealt with it like a year. He threw money at it. It should have not a fifth should fucking thrown diamonds on the ground. So she slipped.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       Isn't it funny what pitches we are. We get a fascinating. What do you think he said? She said to him exactly what you're talking about. So worried, worried about death and obscurity. Worried about space. Worried about the fact that we're floating around. They landed A. Oh, here's a great story. They landed a fucking comment. They landed on a comet and uh, the guy who landed on the comet was wearing a shirt that had all these photos, are these drawings of women on it and land on a comment. They landed a drone on a comment. It says, I don't care if you landed on spacecraft, landed a spacecraft. I'll say it again. I don't care if you land a space craft on a comet, your shirt is sexist and ostracizing. I'm not kidding. This is where our world is today. Pull this up, Brian. Pull, pull it up, pull it up.

Speaker 2:          00:46:34       Um, it's on my twitter feed. I retweeted it, but here's the title is I don't care if you landed on ace 11, landed a spacecraft on a comment. Your shirt is sexist and ostracizing. It's just God damn a beautiful representation by the way, the shirt is designed by a woman. And who said that? Who said that to him? That's an article. There was an article. Yeah. I mean it's just a social justice warrior status. That is funny about the Internet is that everyone has. Everyone has a voice, but the bad thing is everyone has a voice. Yeah. Look at this carefully and is fucking beautiful. That's beautiful. And it's just women in scantily clad outfits. Now, here's my question. This is, we're willing to get real with this. When you see, um, maybe there's a better picture of it, but we can get a close up look at his face, look at his, find his name and find a shirt.

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       I'm sure there's some closeup photos of it because there's a big event that they had and this guy chose to wear this shirt and everybody's freaking out that he chose to wear the shirt. Um, and you know, people are saying, yeah, they wonder why women aren't accepted in science and I don't even know that that's true. How much or how hard it is for women to get into science or how easy it is. I really don't know. So I'm not going to be talking out of my ass, but look it. There it is. You can see the picture and it's just women in lingerie and fetish outfits. Comic Book. It looks like wonder woman in. Well, no, I wouldn't say that. I mean that chick has like a skin tight leather core set and I can just now make it out though. You know, it's not like, it seems like kind of cosmic too, right?

Speaker 2:          00:48:13       What is that a son behind that one chick? Yeah. It looks like Superhero. Other planets involved in there. I don't know what it is. You should be able to wear a shirt. One of those of like someone's killing children are those online and I'll wear it for the next podcast. You can order a bunch of them, find it, find out who makes it online, what's where I'm willing to make the guests. Were it for a week at your hazing? Well, you know, I don't know if a woman makes it, how it could be sexist. Well, I guess it could be if you were. It was sexist intentions, but for some women it's not sexist at all. For some women it's just sexy women in seductive poses. Like would you think that it would be sexist if a woman had like Chippendale's dudes all over her shirt?

Speaker 2:          00:48:54       I wouldn't get upset about it and I don't think it's either. Maybe I wouldn't even necessarily think she was a horny chick. Well, if the dicks route that's a different story had their dicks out and they were holding onto him like, like shotguns, you can't ignore dicks that events. That wouldn't. I wouldn't be mad. I wouldn't say that shirt, sexist. I wouldn't be upset at all. So is the object objectification of men? Is that acceptable? But the objective, it is acceptable. Everyone's fine with that. Do you see what's going on? Man? You're going crazy, the world's going to go a little crazy, but there there is a double standard with the sexes and I think it has a lot to do with that. Like you know when men are the aggressors, of course. And that's the difference. Yeah, and when we, when we get raped, nobody cares.

Speaker 2:          00:49:42       No one cares that it's a joke photo. It's a big joke, you know, that I put up the other day of this dude who was blacked out in these three girls with bikinis or climbing all over him and the caption was captured, was poorly spelled, but it was something like a, you know, how different would it be if the sexes were reversed? Yeah. In this particular photo blacked out. You almost go to jail just for that photo. You know, even if it was an overweight woman that was blacked out and a bunch of guys that were like studly, every woman wants to fuck guys still. It still be a creepy photo. Go down as harassment and borderline sex crime. Why are they giving this guy a hard time for his fucking shirt? They sit, let them. God Damn bought on a comment. Let them have. Can you land a robot on the comment I didn't even know was possible.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       I wish a hundred miles an hour. I wish his reaction though when she said that to him, I wish he would just be like, shut the fuck up and locked away. But hold on a second. I don't think someone said anything to him. Oh No. This isn't someone who interviewed him. This is a review of him doing it. Yeah. The girl with the mic doesn't care at all. Right. In the eyes. I thought this was him going like her freaking out. No, no, and by the way, it's by a dude, the articles written by two and he's ultimately just trying to get laid to. That's the funny part. He is doing what he thinks is right. Yeah. You know, he's, he's pointing it out. He thinks it's right. I mean we could disagree with them all day.

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       I don't know. I don't think it's a big deal, but I also think people are so fucking hung up on bodies, man. People are really hung up on the use of people's bodies and imagery and you know, comic book depictions of bodies and it's primarily a female issue, primarily of objectification of female issue. Like if a guy showed up at work and he had a bunch of male bodies, just like really yolked superhero male bodies all over his shirt, it would just be hilarious. It will be fine. It would be, it would be funny. But if he shows up with these, these looking at these women in these photos are these, uh, these images on a shirt, they're just all like perfect specimen. Like, yeah, cartoonish looking characters. I just sent you a link to buy the shirt. I don't want to say it out loud so they won't sell out.

Speaker 2:          00:52:02       Don't sell out there. Fifty $9. I'll take it. Go Up to seven xl. That's actually cut to layer it with a fat shaming version. That's what it is. You know, it's just, uh, a bunch of people that think those images look good. Is it sexist? What, what is that? Because of sexless Matt. Uh, what is sexy exactly is sexist is when you, I think discriminator treat people differently based on their sex or the way they look. All right, so is having a shirt with a bunch of pretty women on it like that. Is that objectifying women? Kind of, right? Um, to some degree. But if you're asking me, I don't find it offensive ones. One bit assurance. God Damn Glorious. I can't wait for it to arrive. We can make our own shirts and Brian Cowen, that's me in the lower right hand corner. When you're 21, you're right.

Speaker 2:          00:52:55       It is funny. When there's naked guys. Foley, if you went to the gym in the middle, man literally is kind of funny. If you had that uninsured, I don't, it wouldn't really bug me. No, there'll be no blogs about it. Oh see that's type t t e a. Why is this a tea? Is that a t shirt? This is a fabric. So we can make our own clothes. We should make our, all of our clothes bedsheets out of that. I should hire like a real shower. Expensive. Tailored to make me an awesome suit of the jacket and the pants with a vest, a tie. The whole thing will be on the inside of the vast, like the ones the UFC made me. They have like little skull and crossbones and the sat and we could have all little dicks. Yeah. Little Dicks. And we're talking about this last night.

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       Like I want to um, have a house and have the people trim their bushes. Yeah. I want to cut my bushes in the shape of a cock and balls. Yeah. Yeah. Just have it all through the, you know, the front of the yard. Just all cock and balls shaped right. Bushes. Do you think that would get you in trouble with the Neighborhood Association? Would, would not like that one. They know exactly what it is. It's a Bush. They, they would still get pissed window fucked up and talked about it. That's what. Yeah. Once you're in a neighborhood, like I'm assuming like if you have people cutting your bushes that it's a nice neighborhood. If they can see that shit, they feel like they can say shit about that. I assume. What could, what does that, Brian, just this, this fabric, a fabric.com has all these sexual. That's fantastic. That's fabric that is sexist, Brian, and that's male. Patriarchy and I'm all bad things. Wow. I'm going to write a blog about how great that is.

Speaker 2:          00:54:37       How much of it. I mean, how much of it is. Is there a line that ever has to be drawn? I mean, what if you had like tits? What if, what if these girls on this shirt, we're completely naked instead of these. I mean, these outfits are tiny. They're wearing these little corsets and thongs. They're acids are hanging out. If you ask me totally naked, if you ask me, it's fine. I mean it's just, it's just the body. But if you're a woman, okay. And you're working with a guy and he's kind of creepy anyway. Yeah. But he's got a shirt with naked chicks all over. It probably wouldn't like it if I was a walking hate it. So that is kind of sexual harassment, right? Right. So if that sexual harassment and you take it just one step before that, which is their scantily clad, it's pretty God damn close to them being naked step before it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:22       Got to see how if you were a chick and you around a guy wearing that, that would be on the creep tip because although we would like to compare it to men, the problem is like a woman with a, a bunch of men on her shirt is probably not going to rape you. Right, right. Yeah. And it's not even the worst thing in the world. If a woman ramps you, not that most men wearing this shirt would rape you because most wouldn't. Right. But there's a few guys who would rape you and it only takes one. Let's face it before just, you know, it's a huge inconvenience or they probably would wear like some Mr Rogers shit so that you would never see it coming. Yeah. You got to watch out with those guys for that with the sweater vest sweater. That's a dead giveaway.

Speaker 2:          00:56:04       I don't know man. I just to make a good point, I would hate to be a chick working in an office with a dude who was creeping on me. Yeah, absolutely. Have you ever worked in an office where chick was creeping on you? Um, I can't. I can't remember a chick creeping on me. Yeah, that was definitely flirting and actually, yeah. Now that you mentioned I did hook up with this, that I worked at it, but that seems fun. That's like voluntary. It's fun and say Hook Up. But you hear about the one dude that was like jizzing in this chick's coffee for like a year. Yeah. That's awful. Yeah. And then they caught him. He admitted he'd been in her coffee for a year. That's so great. How long did it take from an admitted, whereas he just like bad. Did it? Let's find out. How long was he?

Speaker 2:          00:56:43       He was just in her coffee for a long time. Right. You would never drink liquids again. You would never let anyone hands you a cup of anything ever again. Fifty percent of women love the taste of come. I saw 35 percent. Actually, I saw one recently where a guy was caught on a hidden camera pissing in the coffee pot. He was using pis to make coffee. Yeah. And uh, he was, he was making these guys that he worked with drinking and everybody was like, there's something going on here, man. This coffee smells weird. As they install the hidden camera and you see this guy looking around and pulling his cock out and pissing in the fucking coffee client like you to think of how much of that guy's pissed. Those dudes drank his coffee. He's given me a weird buzz man. I hate to hear shit. Like that's what happens when you have to work in an office for 1130, literally insane. Thirty four year old Blaine, Minnesota man is accused of ejaculating on his coworker's desk and inner office. You faces two counts of criminal sexual conduct for that. Allegedly happened since late February. There's been checking off on her fucking death for like six months. Creep arrested for ejaculate.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       Coffee Creek. That's so non objective journalism. That's the difference between like the fucking Internet, like what you're doing a blog and like New York Times. That's why the Internet rules, because the New York Times could never have creep ejaculates in women's class. It would be man. Yeah, but the Internet is more accurate. Man. Arrested for or allegedly. Yeah. This is like how many girls I like fingering themselves. Then stirring your iced tea. Very few. Like, I don't know. Very 70 percent. Very few. Yeah. No, that never happens. It probably wouldn't. It's Kinda happened somewhere. Someone has done it. Is that the guy started off guy. Okay, now think about that poor bastard life. Yeah. How about we show a little empathy towards him. If you really get to the moment in your life where you're jerking off and your coworkers Coffee Cup dudes are women that were drinking the juice makes a lot. It means a lot. He has one chicken particular and Jackie elated coworkers. Coffee is that. Oh my God, she's so prone to jerk off in her coffin. You GotTa do what? You got to get a little on her lip and she doesn't know his licks it off. Oh my God. This is hilarious. She didn't. She didn't taste that for a year. Huh? She didn't listen to this. According to the criminal complaint employee

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       at, we don't need to say the names. Place hardware store called police. On August 26th saying she thought Lynn, her coworker was leaving bodily fluids on her desk. She told officers that she found Lynn that afternoon standing in front of her desk, back turned to her and his hands near his crotch. The worker wasn't sure what Lynn was doing, but she told police that he had a deer in the headlights expression on his face when he noticed her behind him, quickly left the room and slammed the door behind him. The worker said seconds later, Lynn came back and told the worker that he had a question for her, but for. Got It. He then left the area. The worker told police. She inspected her desk and found fluid on the surface dripping onto the floor. A lot of it had been absorbed into her hair scrunchy, which she put into a plastic bag when at the scene officers collected the coffee Mug, coffee and scrunchy the worst told police that she had been.

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       She had problems with Lynn for months. He had allegedly leave his zipper down. Often it happens so much that the worker said she threatened to, uh, portland if it happened again. She threatened to report. And why don't you report them know. Wow, this is what happens when you make people work eight hours a day. He admitted to ejaculating on his coworker's desk and coffee on August 26th, which was his birthday. Well, come on. Give him a pass or leave that the story flows. Fucking mean. Officers. They arrested that guy on his birthday. Oh my God. He said he ejaculated and the coffee twice in the last six months and a on her desk four times wiping up the mess with the scrunchie. Hmm. He told police he was attracted to his coworker and did this to get her to notice. And her desk. Oh, you also said that he knew it was gross and wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       The complaint states this is, the world has become a fucking parody. Do Piano and Jelly sandwiches for racist dudes jerking off and people's coffee. Yeah. What the fuck? I think it all comes back to what you said. Like everyone's just trying to distract themselves. Yeah. You know what? We're trying to just get over that. I think living life, knowing that you're just a part of a giant mystery, we don't know how it's going to end. You know, how works, what's going to happen for me to do the next. Right. It's just too much for most people. You also, a lot of people are doing things with their lives that they're not even into like you got. Get that guy's not into his job. Oh yeah, no doubt. No doubt. That's why he's jerking off on desks and shit. Exactly. And so, you know, you got to do something for a living and most people don't get to do what they want for a living. Poor bastard, but, but way more poor her than poor m. Oh poor that dudes come twice. Who would you ever trust again? Not, not dudes with their pants down. Tell you that the fact that she didn't the first time like report, it means that she doesn't really care that she's been drinking. Come. No Man, she still be embarrassing for her,

Speaker 2:          01:02:21       but if you got caught drinking come, you'd be like police, like your boss. You'd go right to be like, I don't want to drink. I think I might be a little embarrassed to admit that I drank com. If you found a. do you know what I mean? What would you rather do? Have you found a dude he knew that he came and your Coffee Cup. Would you be? Would you be like, look man, you can't do that anymore. It was at work. If it was like at a job. Can we talk about this? I mean, would you be like, Hey, don't do this anymore. Would you hit them? Would you just go immediately to the authorities? Like how would you handle it? I've kissed him on the cheek and go, you fucked up buddy. I have no idea. I think I will report it within the company and let them take it to the cops.

Speaker 2:          01:03:02       Don't you think that a dude coming into your coffee cup is so extreme that you'd be real cautious about how you interacted with them? I don't think you'd beat his ass. I'll tell you that. This is why if a guy came in your crop and you drank it, you'd be like, whoa. Like what are you doing? Like, who? Who are you man? I'm like, are you a fucking serial killer? Or something like what kind of a person can jerk off in your coffee and then sit back and watch as you drink it. That's like a mentally ill person. Absolutely. So you didn't have to think like how you handled that situation whether or not you beat their ass. No violent. What'd you go? Then I would take the Coffee Cup and smashed it over his head. And then to that man, if you hit someone with a Coffee Cup, that's like a fucking deadly weapon.

Speaker 2:          01:03:41       Yeah. But if he had to come in my fucking coffee. Okay. But if he had saliva and your coffee, would you stab them with a broken clock? Spit. I would scream at him. They'd go to the bus. But comes completely different. What if your hot cocoa is different? But if you have to be pretty close Cox not regular snack, I would. It would get violent probably if I. If it. What? Would you rather drink guys? Louis or a load? Probably a load because I'm sure it tastes better. It tastes better smoke because there's not one girl that goes.

Speaker 2:          01:04:11       He's a mediator. He opens your mouth and spit it. That should be a fucking new game show. I should be a new game. Show me smokers. Spit in your mouth and see how many times you can take without swallowing. Throwing up a smoker, hooking longyis and spitting in your mouth and the every. For every lucky that goes in there, you get 10 grand. Yeah, that'd be fun to train for. I know that much. You know why? Because there's some people with some serious fucking student loans. You know like I know a friend who has $300,000 in student loans. I bet you could hook loogies in his mouth for a couple of days. I would be very tempted this month to do that, to play that game. I hate to tell you, I don't know if I do it, but I think about it, if you could start to think about it.

Speaker 2:          01:04:56       I'm going to start a business. I look into some Novacane from my tongue. Why? No Dude, who, uh, he needed money to start a business. So he went to fucking Iraq, whereas a mercenary. Really? Yeah. He was in the military and went back and worked as a contractor a couple of times. Did it twice. He did it just because he needed money. Does he work for when he does not have those fucking unmentionable names? Gotcha. Crossed. But uh, people do anything if they need money. I know people, people get to that situation where they have a serious debt and no way out of it. Yeah. You can split their mouth. Absolutely. There's no doubt about it. Spitting out cum in your mouth. That's a different game show. And that's higher stakes. Well, that's what God fear factor cancel. Really? Yeah. They had a drink. Come.

Speaker 2:          01:05:42       There's a video of it online. Have you noticed by the way that the facebook for fear factor just started posting videos again, out of nowhere, they're making all these new clips, these new fear factor clips with UNM and it's probably because it was on like a bunch of those channels like chiller and all those different things. It's been on them a few times out of nowhere. I'm just getting all these like, hey, fear factor page released a new video that was a ridiculous show. It's hard to believe that the show was even real and I was, I was the host of it. It was real. And so did you didn't really audition. They came to you with that idea up and running, right? Well, no, the idea already existed in another country. It was called now or never land in the Netherlands. In Holland. And what was your reaction to this show?

Speaker 2:          01:06:24       I was like, this is ridiculous. I really did that, that it was going to be cancelled immediately. I got a whole joke about it. Yeah. You know, used to do on stage. But um, I did have to audition for it though. They had to see how I would interact with people. So um, I went down Hollywood boulevard with a camera crew and just stuck cameras in people's faces and start asking them questions like, can I ask you a question man? And they, you know, they come over and then I started asking them like, what kind of food and just be silly with them. So they wanted that baby. Look at me. Gorgeous fire dude. Damn that fear factor on twitter's now a posting again too weird. Don't try to get me to do that show again. Brian.

Speaker 2:          01:07:10       Joe, come on. You're getting too busy already, man. I'll do be doing less of this and I'm better at this. What if somebody like live leak bought the name fear factor in like, Joe, we want you to do fear of not doing anything different. No. The only way I would ever do that again is if they broke the bank. I mean they'd have to. I'd have to literally do some shit that would bankrupt a small foreign country. Drown you in cash. I'd have to literally make so much money, I would think about like giant hunting preserves that I could buy, you know, like in Colorado by a thousand acres and set up a fucking solar log cabin and vibe Brian over for dinner and then hunt him. No ever have things like Brian. Brian's like, he's like the puppy. You keep her on the house barks when Shit's going down. You don't want to chase him. So rude. I had a friend that went to one of those, uh, they have these hunting ranches. It's really kind of fucked up where they will let an animal out there, like which animal do you want to hunt and what not, like have a menu and you go and you point it. And like this is

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       one deer that has awesome antlers. So. Okay, let out number a. So the open the cage and this fucking thing goes wandering out. It goes right to the feeder because there's like a feeder that the deer's eat from every day and you just sit and wait in front of the feet or for him to show up and then you blast them. Oof, wow. I mean look, I guess that's better than farming. I guess that's better than just, you know, raise their cow houses I guess, but it's kind of, I mean the only thing, I mean it's not a big area either, so like a couple hundred acres. It's a pretty small. I mean it's big for a yard, but it's not big for where a deer can get away from you. Sure. No, they just let us fuck her out and you go looking for them, but they keep pens.

Speaker 1:          01:08:57       I was like, that is one of the craziest things I've ever heard of in my life and it's totally legal. Yeah, I'm sure it is. Yeah. I don't know about all that. I don't know about all that. That seems. It seems like a good way to get antlers. You know, if you want to make sure you shoot a deer with a big giant fucking head of antlers. But I mean, I guess it's what the supermarket, if somebody wanted to kill you just for like your teeth, just to know that you're so crazy. It's worse than your teeth because you lose your antlers every year and then the that baby teeth, I'll give them to you. There's a whole thing about collecting sheds. Yeah, like people collect these deer sheds and one of the things that does is it lets them know what kind of deer on their land.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       So if you go collect the sheds and you find these big antlers, like, Whoa, there's a big deer on this land I don't even know about because a lot of them they'll, there'll be like nocturnal, like especially when there's like hunting pressure or they think that there's too many people around. They bed down during the day and they only come out and eat at night. So you don't, you don't even see them there until you find these antlers like running around. So it's worse than that. Someone would want to kill you for some shit that you throw away every year. But then there's the meat, the meat's delicious. So sweet potato and garlic, little semen and coffee to full charge. You need to wear that fucking shirt with all the guys on it and go sit in the corner. Fuckin terrible, terrible person shirt. No. This shirt with all with all the tax on it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:27       Yeah. Yeah. We need a name for that shirt. We should do that. Like one day where the shirt will get them tailored. Would you wear them? If I got stuff tailored, I'll wear a cream pie. Okay. Try to find the gayest material that you could find online and we'll bring it to a tailor and we'll have some suits made up. Have you seen David shows? Butthole hat? He has a butthole. Just a butthole. Aso's Butthole. Am I speeding? So there's no cheeks or anything. It's just the whole. The butthole. It's so great. It's the best part. That's uncomfortable.

Speaker 1:          01:10:58       David chose. Fuck crazy man. He's fucking crazy. That's exactly what happens. Like David chose exactly what happens when you say, what would you do if you had all the fucking money you could ever want? That's what you would do. You do exactly what he's doing and on top of that, he can still sell those paintings. He makes for an godly sums of money when he makes. It's not like he's not making money. He, he sells his paintings were like insane amounts of money, but then on top of that, he's got hundreds of millions of dollars that came from him painting facebook. Right. So, right. The whole thing, he just doesn't give a fuck. Yeah. He literally doesn't give a fuck. He's so crazy. His shit that he's doing like on his instagram is so hilarious. Have you watched any of them? No, I gotta I gotTa look into dude, it's so funny. It's him and Bobby Lee and they have this thing called, one of them is called Han Dynasty and the other one is, uh, what is the other one? The other one is something about space. Let me pull it up because it's so ridiculous. But he's constantly doing shit constantly thing. This is the guy that took stock and facebook. This guy. Yeah. He's hilarious dude. And he's awesome as a podcast guest to you. Let me find out what the fuck is. His videos are called, but they put them up all the time and they're really ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:12:17       That looks great guys. A genius. It's made out of pizza. The pizza crust. This is a. He just recently did this mural that he posted on his instagram. Check this out. How awesome. That is. Awesome. He's a bad motherfucker, dude. He's such a good guy too, man. He's just like such a sweetheart. And he's, he, he enjoys being shocking and he was a victim of a lot of people freaking out about one of his podcasts because he had said something crazy about how uh, he got a massage and forced them to suck his dick forced. But people got mad at him because he raped somebody who kind of, you know, he exaggerates shit. It's a girl he actually is dating or has sex with on a regular basis. Like his version of the story is not completely accurate. Like he, he leaves out stuff and add stuff to make it more fucked up because he's, he's, he's fucking with you. Yeah. You go down until you find this one that looked good. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:25       He's got underwear on his face and him and Bobby Lee and it's just, it's so ridiculous. They're doing all these crazy videos. Hong Galaxies, the other one. There's Hong Dynasty and Hong Galaxy and he's just having fun. That's what he's doing. He's just having fun. He was on vice for awhile, but when he did that thing where they're doing the wrestling girls, but when he did that thing where he, uh, told that story about getting the massage lady to blow them. Yeah. They kicked them off. Vice. Really? Yeah. He got kicked off the show. I know a girl that used to write for advice and she got kicked off for writing something racist like two years ago on twitter. They went through a whole twitter feed. I should rephrase. He didn't get kicked off, but they gave him an option. The option was get rid of your instagram. Get rid of your twitter. No more social media stuff. Get rid of your podcasts.

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       And he was like, what? That's what I did my thing. He spelled it w t two. It was a fuck outta here. He pulled out his bank card. I just want to show you how many Zeros. There's a lot of Zeros. Those don't give a fuck points. This is fuck you money. So fuck you. I mean, I see it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:36       Nobody's point, man. I really do. That's the real problem with twitter and blogs is you get one point and even twitter it's one point and then one point and then one point. Then when you know one person back and you're playing tennis back and forth with the idea, it's just an ineffective way to communicate and resolve things. Communicating live in person is the only way. Yeah. Everything else is. It only works if everybody agrees to a certain series rules and like you establish that you're going to communicate with someone the way you would expect to be communicated with by then like best case scenario.

Speaker 2:          01:15:11       I saw you on twitter sticking up for somebody that was just getting hammered. Oh, that was a person who wrote something bad about me too. But you were like, hey look, we can all have our opinions. It's all good.

Speaker 1:          01:15:22       Yeah. I mean I never said anything shitty to her. Yeah, no, we, um, when we went back and forth on twitter we were, we were talking about the actual issue at hand. She said a few ad homonym things about me, but they weren't anything really bad, you know, it was like something about um, uh, like what qualifies you to that opinion? Is it making people eat bugs on fear factor things along those lines was like, okay, you know, even if you say something mean to me it just means I'm going to stop communicating with you because I know I'm getting better at this. Right. And um, I know when to engage people when not to, but I also know like what I get out of it, you know, what do I get out of it? I get it, something out of it. If we can get a little long and get through something civilly, I get something out of it.

Speaker 1:          01:16:03       I feel good. Sure. When I have an interaction with somebody online and if there's some sort of a minor disagreement we could end with. It's all good. That's cool. Well thank you very much. Alright, cool man. Nice. I liked that. So I go towards that as much as I can in this life and I've made mistakes. I think we all have, but when I go to someone's twitter page and it's just a constant series of these fucking bitter back and forth feuds, I'm like, you're doing it wrong, right? You're doing it wrong. We're all, you know, we're all learning this as we go along. I think.

Speaker 2:          01:16:32       How'd you feel after the men see a fight? I hate to keep bringing it up, but I just watched it last night. Again, Brian and I have talked about this a million times. Brian's favorite piece of, or my favorite piece of Brian's work. It was this cool to get all these pieces, it easy songs. Um, but uh, there was a lot of negativity attached to it, a lot, a lot of negative fucking comments and tweets and messages I guess was like my space back then. But it was, there was a lot of email. A lot of people got my email and sent me a lot of, like really nasty shit, but it was so poorly spelled, like the majority of it to save. Think he's still

Speaker 1:          01:17:15       got a folder on my fucking email called, it's just called fans because it was so bad. It was so ridiculous. It was like, come on. Is this real? This is real. People like it didn't even like the big one. One of the big ones was them saying, you know, he did it better. Yeah, I heard that cause he did it better just because he did it better. Okay. You're like fucking all jealous over there because he did it better. But even that died off. Man Stopped. It was a moment in comedy history. Yeah. But a lot of negativity, man, lot of negativity attached to it. But sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty. Well you stuck up for a lot of people. That's the thing. And I remember you used to write about it. I think I used to see it on my space or whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:18:03       I mean you stick up for a lot of little guys when you did that, you know. Well that's where it all came from. It came from guys like Johnny Sanchez getting fucked over and are we getting fucked over? And countless numbers of dues. It's, it makes for a hostile environment when you have to hit that flashing light at the store because you know he's in the back of the room. If everyone comics, I'll have that little little signal thing. They would go over and flick the light a couple of times because he was in the back of the room. Right. That's just dark dude. Yeah, but we're learning, you know, and we're learning. Now. Look, if he had to start his career over again, dudes, good performer, man. If he could start his career over again and just do it the right way, you know, he, he would have been a different person if he started out today as opposed to back then, yeah, probably be a different person, but if you get off on the wrong foot and you stay on that wrong foot and then you justify your actions all along the way, you get to a point where you're two decades into a career that's bullshit and you don't know how to write.

Speaker 1:          01:18:57       Yeah. You don't know how to write it all. Yeah. That's a super common thing. You see that with biters, you see that with guys going back and trying to create new stuff and it's like, oh my God, you're lost at sea. Like you, you literally don't know how to do it. Like the, you would see the contrast between the stuff that they obviously stole and then the stuff they obviously wrote. Right? And it's like, oh good Lord, like this is like you're speaking two different languages. It's like one of these things is made out of vegetables and one of these things made out of shit.

Speaker 1:          01:19:28       It's so obvious to anybody who's paying attention, but I don't know, man. It's um, sometimes it's important to do negative things. Yeah. It's just, it depends on what's happening. But it also exposed a lot about the businessman that people didn't want to believe. Yeah. Because nobody wanted to believe that if you like, had a beef with some famous person who had it out for you, that they could ruin your career. Right. But he tried to do that to me. Yeah. And he said he didn't have the power to do it. It did it work so far as the comedy store, was that where you work that weekend? I mean, he got me banned from that weekend. Right. But he made a deal with the guy that's not there anymore. Oh really? I don't know the exact details of it, but it was the only time ever where his name was on the marquee.

Speaker 1:          01:20:13       He never let them put his name on the marquee names on the marquee and he was headlining the whole weekend. Yeah. So it was like this big thing that I was gone and he was headlining, put his name on the Marquee and um, I forgot my point. It doesn't matter. It's a pointless beaten into the ground story. But the bottom line was after all the dust settled, everybody sort of eventually got a sense of what it really was all about. It's really all about is all these people. Some have a similar story and we're all dealing with something that is just undeniable. Is that door open back there? Jamie? See if that fucking doors up because that shit is super loud. It's not. We need to figure out a way to like soundproof the ceiling because when they those guys are banging shit over there banging shit.

Speaker 1:          01:20:59       Not like that kind of bang. I was at a hotel and I heard someone fucker did happen in a long time. I was in a hotel. I was 18. I was in a hotel room with my parents and the people next door were fucking. We beat each other. No, not at all. In the same room with your parents was in the same room with my parents and those people. Fucking next door's. Did your parents do Dave? Everyone. We wanted the elephant in the other room, like good white people. Oh my God. This lady was going like.

Speaker 3:          01:21:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       It was like a shaky thing. She's been rattled. Right? Who's weird? One of the Caesar Girls. Yeah. I don't know. I wasn't loud enough for me to record. I was trying to get my.

Speaker 3:          01:21:41       I phoned up to the door.

Speaker 1:          01:21:43       He hotel. We were in Washington dc at this old hotel. By the way, those old hotels, they can all suck it. Those old hotels. They try to pretend that it's cool to stay in this creaky ass fucking hotel where when someone flushes their toilet three floors above you, it's like a roaring train is running through your room. Every time someone walked above me or hurt, I was like, this is stupid.

Speaker 3:          01:22:07       Yeah. It's a boutique hotel and they're using more expensive than like some of the newer hotels.

Speaker 1:          01:22:12       Yes, it was. It was expensive as fuck. It was stupid dumb ass hotel, but people be fucking couldn't figure out where they were fucking there above me or to the side of me. You ever hear that? It'll stand bit where he's like, not only can you hear them fucking, you can smell it.

Speaker 3:          01:22:31       That's how bad the hotels where there was this place in Arizona, we stayed at that. The bottom of the door had like a good, like three inches underneath it, so you would just be in bed and you would see people walking down the hallway. It's like,

Speaker 1:          01:22:46       that's ridiculous. Yeah, but that's part of the fun of the road. Especially, you know when you're with friends. The early days especially, I stayed once. I did a Gig on this fucking island, block island, an island outside of Rhode Island. I think that's a black guy on a blog, but it's, uh, it's the people that lived there were the drunkest troglodytes I've ever performed in front of ever. I mean, this guy, Scott Scott was the guy who booked it and he was the opening act and he went up and just ate a plate of shit. It was just no one was getting anything out of this crowd. We both sucked at the time, but I mean it was, the Gig was impossible because no one was getting through this alive. It was, there was maybe 30 people in the room. It was like they had a bar and then they just announced the show was going to happen. It was the first one ever first and only one it was me and him. So we did the Gig gigs, death, just hot death. They didn't want to pay us because it was awful. They said, we've salted the people that were, that came there. There wasn't a yelling shit the moment ago.

Speaker 1:          01:23:47       It was just monsters. There were, there were pirates and then we had to stay in a supply room. We had cots that they had set up in a room with stacks of like canned tomatoes and fucking, you know, Syrup for soda machines and Shit and containers of nitrous oxide, that kind of shit. It was like a storage room and they put two cots there with no bathroom and that's where we slept. Shakey's they said they had a room for us. Where's the room? Well, we take it back here and they brought us to this room and it was a storage room. They put a cotton you could sleep here. Fairy comes at six in the morning. So we had to sleep there and then we had to leave on the ferry at 6:00 in the morning, whatever. Time was fucked. Oh, it was gross. And the dude I was with was partying. So he was a disaster. It was just, you know, if you wanted to get drunk and do coke, it was there. Right. It was just everybody was just like, there's no cops here. The cops are coming this fucking crazy island. There's only 100 people. Everyone is like one drink away from death, just barely hanging on. You might as well stay up until six. You could hear their liver like pop rocks going off under their skin. So they're shouting so much liver. It's just fucking struggling to stay together.

Speaker 1:          01:25:04       Like the Millennium Falcon when it was shaking, trying to achieve the warp speed, the liver. I'll just never forget. There was this table of like three or four people together talk and and Scott starts to show when he starts to show that I got, they just turn to them and like yelling, fuck it. That's bobby missing teeth. And their faces are all pruned up from the fucking cold wind and the sea water. It's death. It was one of those places you could not live if you lived. Everybody would just slowly start disappearing and horrible accidents. Sure. Like if they made you live on that island, you'll go, you know, and you had that guys your navy. But alright today I'm taking him fishing and I ain't taking them back. There's mother fuckers gonna fall in the water.

Speaker 1:          01:25:58       Yeah. Where do you live? Fucking super important part of your life. You live in a shitty spot. It's really hard to have fun and now that means shitty spotlight. You're way better off with like really good friends were the weather sucks Dick. Sure. Well yeah, whether cannot destroy you that much, but if you're in a bad neighborhood, that's why. Yeah. Like anybody thinks kids should pull themselves up by their bootstraps. It's tough. Imagine being born and fucking watts living in the worst sections of Inglewood or or you know, being a Gypsy Caravan family and fucking England. You might not even know someone that could teach you how to do it. And there's a lot about examples all over the place of what to do and like we were talking about with Michael Irvin, like kids, everyone's programmed differently so it becomes like this repeating cycle. Unless you get out, unless you are a performer or athlete or someone who figures out a way to start a business and get out of the get out of the neighborhood and sort of reset yourself and figure out what the foot. What kind of fucking trial was I on? What kind of path was I riding on? It must be weird to mix with the rich after that. Well, you know what's the weirdest shit? You could just drive to Beverley hills. Yeah, it's right there. It doesn't take long to get there. So you could live in the worst neighborhood in La and just close your door. Start Your car, start driving in 15 minutes later you're standing in front of a house that's worth $50 million.

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       That's, that's weird. It is weird. I mean that we are. And then how about this? The person who lives in Compton or whatever, shit neighborhood they could get in their car and drive to Tijuana and go, oh, oh, I thought I had it. Let's get back to compton. I'm worried. Get away from this cardboard house with no windows. You know, are we allowed to make fun of Gypsies? Like is there any kind of. Except for gypsy. That's not true. That's not true. There's some feedback. There's some blow back in England. Really Gypsy's yeah. If you start shitting on Gypsies in other countries, they get very upset. Can we still call them Gypsies? Rogatory yet? I don't think so. I don't think it's derogatory. Hmm. Let's look it up. Someone is offended. A lot of Gypsies in Burbank and they, they, they're always hanging out in my dumpster there.

Speaker 1:          01:28:09       American Gypsy hanging out in your dumpster. They pull up in these weird vans that have beads all over on me just like all come out of this van and they all just start going through all the trash and there's a lot of bands in my neighborhood recently, like people just live on my street now in advance. Here we go. Ready? Yo, that's racist. A racial slur. This was a surprise. The end where it wasn't in the retort article on Gawker about a child that was taken away from a couple because she didn't look like them and it says police rescue, mystery, blonde child from Gypsy couple, and then this article goes on to describe that it says the term Gypsies and non preferred and often derogatory term for Roma people. For those of you who aren't aware of the Anti Roma Bigotry, the Roma are an indigenous people of Europe who continued to be pushed from nation to nation and mistreated.

Speaker 1:          01:29:03       Okay? That's one take on it by a friend who lived outside of London who had these Gypsies move into the lot near their friend's house and absolutely destroy it, destroy the neighborhood, leave their trash everywhere. Rob, all the houses in the neighborhood like there are also notorious criminals, notorious, right? I mean there's no. They're not all criminals, but there's a lot of them. They live a crazy lifestyle. They're always bare knuckle fighting. They have these videos, they challenge each other online. It's awesome. Various beautiful slice of our human culture in 2012, but to this portrayal of it is so ridiculously one side of him, right? They are pushed from nation to nation and mistreated. Yeah. I'm sorry. We don't want you leaving your garbage everywhere and fighting in the streets and stabbing my friends. No, please don't do that anymore. Or whatever you been doing.

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       Say stabbing. I don't know if they're involved in stabbing, but that's part of the game is we got a row of town to town and we got to hustle money. They're wild people, man. I mean, it's fascinating. The movie snatch was awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're actually moving on it. Fucking awesome with the way Brad Pitt, that whole dialect, so fucking awesome. The article goes on. They are frequently denied legal status and therefore social services. There are many stereotypes about the Roma, but the most predominant is that they're all sociopathic. Drifters who steal children and anything else that isn't tied down well. It's been my experience that very few people who do nothing wrong or labeled as sociopathic thieves who steal children. Very few people. One of the things that they don't say about those Tibetan Buddhist monks is that there's sociopathic thieves who steal children.

Speaker 1:          01:30:44       Yeah. They said that about a mother theresa a lot to. Right, and all the stationary I think feeds who steal children. Yeah. I don't know man ejaculates in people's coffee. It's not healthy to paint things in a completely unrealistic biased way like this guy is doing just to prove that you're not racist. Right? That shit's not healthy. Now. I know you should talk about the reality of their life. Like it doesn't help anybody if you bullshit people on what these folks do. Right in, and again, it's not all of them, but the fact that you're saying that Gypsy's haven't been involved in conflicts or the Roma people, whatever the fuck you want to call them, you'd be lying. Right? Right. When we could all come up with different reasons for why cultural biological, you know, there's all sorts of variables that are entering into this equation, but to portray it like this, like these, these beautiful people that are just roaming from town to town and everyone's just pushing them away because of the patriarchy because white, white people privileged.

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       Right. I check my privilege online. Did you do that? Yeah, I saw that. Yeah. My Shit. Lord. What? What website is your shit? Fucking asshole. You're a part of the problem. What, what, where can you get your privilege? Check your privilege.com. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'm just about what should be an app and it already was. And then someone sent me a link. It's an actual website. So I went through the website, check my privilege and so you don't have a lot of privilege. Your Shit. Too much privileged. So I'm, that's what it is. Everyone who's. I think if you're white and you don't have aids, you're shit Lord. Okay. I think that's pretty much how it goes. What's going on in this world? There's something strange going on in this world, man. Just something strange, this, this article is proof of it. People are going way out of their way to show that they're sensitive and open minded to the point where they're not really open minded.

Speaker 1:          01:32:31       You're denying reality. Yeah. It's like it doesn't help anybody. It doesn't help anybody to only only side with the maligned and mistreated in the misrepresented to always side with them. Yes. That's not, that's not healthy. Like marginalized people. There's marginalized groups for sure and it's good to recognize when they're being mistreated, but the reality of their behavior can't be ignored. Like you can't do that. Right? It muddies up the whole thing. Yeah. You can still sign with them, but you have to admit the facts and you have to admit that they survive ways that can hurt other civilians. Other people. Yeah. And you know what man, hey, that's the reality of the world they're thrust into. Yeah. If you were there, like, you know, I watched this video on poachers in Africa and all these people that like, they, they, uh, they illegally capture these animals and sometimes it's the only food that these people can get, like, like they're in terrible situations.

Speaker 1:          01:33:31       They have these ridiculous guns. They construct, they, they make their own charges and light. They're gone sometimes with a lighter and then shoot it at these animals. I mean they pack these things like muskets. I think a rifle and a packet, like a musket and then like, like, like a fuse, like it's a bomb. I mean, it's ridiculous how poor and rudimentary some of this shit is. These guys are doing. You gotta wonder like, what are this? What are these guys? Options man, right? I mean, you're getting mad at this guy for poaching animal's needs. Yeah. It's terrible to shoot someone else's property. You know? Even if you are starving to death, it seems, it seems wrong, but moved to America and work on Wall Street. Why does he do that? He knows it's this should. Why doesn't he get an education? Why hasn't he wash his feet?

Speaker 1:          01:34:14       He's got old plastic water bottles that he's turned into flip flops. What's this Guy Thinking? Why isn't he smarter? Yeah, you can't. You can't judge people like that. The way you would judge a person from a normal neighborhood with a normal background. I mean normal bilich healthy. No, no, no. Serious trauma. There's a reason he's in that situation. You're not in that situation. You don't seek that situation. No. What the fuck, man, that's, that's the real problem with the world. The real problem in the world is like the one percent that everybody wants to think about that if you make more than $34,000 a year, you're in the top one percent of all people on the planet. Really? I did not know that. Yeah. Kevin Smith and I talked about it the other day and I've talked about it on this podcast before too. That's a real number.

Speaker 1:          01:35:00       That's so when you talking about poachers, are you talking about impoverished people? The level of poverty that the people who work at Foxconn have. When you say, man, those people live there. There's nets around the building to keep them jumping off the roof, like we can't even imagine what that life is like. And those are people just like, you just like me, just like you, just, just people just, if we were born in China, we'd be like, fuck dude, we got to go to the Foxconn. We can't go. We can't have the option to go to the store tonight. You know what's called perform at the comedy store? No, we can't. We have to make cell phones for a nickel an hour.

Speaker 4:          01:35:30       I got a suicide at noon. Um, how, how does that work? They don't like apply for those jobs. Do they just kind of. If they can, I don't even know if there's enough jobs to supply all the people that are poor and looking for jobs there. There's a billion people in China. It's crazy. A billion and they just hacked our weather system. Did you see that? We're talking about the US said today that China has hacked our radar and satellite are or whether or like one of our things that we use for our news every day and they packed it or satellite and that's why I pull up an article on it so we can get a more definitive description of what's going on. That's why I feel like the whole month of October, I think there was very limited radar in the news and the consumer from China hacked our radar dishes, governments, but that's hilarious. China, so the Chinese government hacked our radar system or whether system, whether it radar, what are they doing with it? They stealing the data. Why do they care what the temperature is over here? US weather's so much while I'm at 75 degrees in Los Angeles, by the way, terrible accidents. Both of us, both of us. I didn't know which way to go to go. Super Chinese are just weird.

Speaker 4:          01:36:50       Weird. If you don't know what you're doing. Chinese reportedly hack us weather systems. What Chinese hackers allegedly broke into the US weather systems in September and caused federal cyber security forces to block sensitive data needed for crucial uses, including disaster planning and aviation. So they, they, they fucked with like a lot more than just like the weather radar. Wow. But uh, who knows who's doing that though? You know, we say China, like who just is a billion people. Could be one asshole would call it China. Yeah. It's only like one to 10 assholes. Who were they saying, you know what I mean, to be food in China. Did this. And we're blaming China. Right. Let's go to war. I mean, is this. Yeah. Is this an official government a thing that did this or looking by the way while we're looking. Did you try to sit in that chair? You prefer better? This is way better for my posture. Right? Better for my back. But I knew I was going to need to lounge a little bit while I was here. I don't know. That's your thing. So this is a clearly better chair, but this me more relaxed.

Speaker 2:          01:37:57       I'll give up relaxation for posture. Yeah. Alright. I'm still with the Ergonomic chairs, the best ergonomic chair I've ever had earlier this week. The posts also reported that Chinese government hackers were suspected of breaking into the US Postal Service computer networks and stealing the personal data belonging to hundreds and thousands of employees. Retires and customers or employees of the post office. Yeah. The Chinese government's supposedly awesome broken to our usbs or us, but their. Their government hackers. Yeah. They're government hackers, meaning that they know my po box. That's terrifying. They're getting all those things that try to get you to join scientology. They're getting all those first. Getting all those postcards to again, take a personality test before I can fuck. I've been scientists. Who knows what that means though. Chinese government hackers who does. What does that mean? You know, I'm not sure. That's such a broad statement for what department?

Speaker 2:          01:38:51       Under whose jurisdiction? Like with what objective, who are the humans that are doing it? You know, you say Chinese government hackers like. Yeah. Okay. It could be anybody. It could be someone blaming the Chinese because they are doing it. Know who the fuck knows. They don't really break that down. Huh? Fucking Gypsies. So. So Gypsy Bro. Well, Romas at black chips. So that's kind of like a loophole. No, you better not transgender Gypsies to stop right there. Don't say God damn. Trend to Gypsies. Trans Gypsies got our podcast canceled. You did this shit Lord. Tractor hit the roof. Kind of look into that loophole. You're not supposed to say bitch anymore, which is a new one to try and take away. Bitch sucks. It's such a nice heart out on a sentence like fuck you bitch. You know, listen to you and works comedically. Some girl at the comedy store the other day, one of the waitresses said, get the fuck Outta here.

Speaker 2:          01:39:50       Bitch said it to this dude. And I gave her knuckles. I go, that was a strong bitch. Yeah. It's like she goes, it was right. Yeah. The way it came out just said, yeah, I would hate to live in a world where someone couldn't say something like that. Like the Joe when Joey d is correct. You like, please bitch, get the fuck Outta here bitch. The best way to condescend and just and humiliate someone and onstage. It's one of my favorite words. I will not stop using it if you got. If you got a sentence, it's not. Or a punchline is not really working. You can throw one bitch a set in there and that'll save that punchline sometimes. Yeah. Maybe you just need to get back to the drawing board with that fucking bitch on it and call it a day. Silly Bitch. I'll never give up.

Speaker 2:          01:40:32       Say No matter what Allie bitches. So unthreatening yeah. That it just should be let slide in it. Which makes sense. You know what I'm saying? It's like you can't say you silly kike no. Hey, that's on you a, it's not even cute. Rude, silly gypsy. That middle ground. Yeah. You know, I wonder if you could still say homo. No, I haven't heard anybody trying to ban it. You'll be okay. But it's not. It's frowned upon. I think it's not supposed to say something's gay. Sure. Can't say, Oh my God, this movie's Gay. That's uh, that's not good. You obviously can't say the F bomb. Yeah. He can't say fag. She easily not even with the hail, usually you can say faggotry because it has not been defined. Yeah. Um, yeah. But, um, Homo. I haven't heard a peep nobody's band at yet. Maybe I should shut the fuck up homo campaign. It's like the seven words you can't say on TV became the seven words you can't say on TV in a way. Well, like, fag isn't Mafac is short for Faggot. So it's not like a part of a word that's a legitimate world like Homosapian, Homosapian, homosexual homeostasis, you know, there's like a lot. I know there's a lot of trap doors in that. There's a lot of ways out of that. I meant homosapien. Yeah, yeah. No Homo sapiens.

Speaker 2:          01:41:55       Gypsy, you know, you can't say that. That's, that's. Yeah, that's kind of gypsy though. They don't procreate. They do. Their magic balls had to ruin. It isn't like the ones with the magic balls and the cards and like the. Yeah, they are, they have the crystal balls, crystal balls and the uh, reading your fortune. I mean, there've been hustlers from the beginning, but again, it's fucking born into. You're born into that shit. What would you do? You're telling me that you would figure out, oh, my culture is insufficient in so many areas. I need to get out and explore the subtle nuances of life and education and change my verbiage and my vernacular and moved to Cambridge and come on. Yeah. Maybe by the time you're 15, if you're lucky to have that kind of individual thought, but otherwise you just don't fucking cards out three card Monte fucking hustling.

Speaker 2:          01:42:51       Motherfuckers drugging babies. Oh, that's what I heard about the Gypsies drug and babies stay drugged to babysit. I don't cry. There was a story of a lady drug to baby on an airplane. She got arrested. She was a stewardess and she gave a baby benadryl because the baby was screaming and crying. Yeah. We get warm Jack. Two babies in Ohio. Put a little in there. No, it turned out cooked your brain and shit ain't good. You think it's okay to say Homo Gypsy? Yes. These are all terrible things. When Israel terrible would have done your lump better. Yeah. Good night's sleep at some orange juice. Get your fucking electrolytes in order, son. It's bugging me, man, that like this already laying thing that we were talking about yesterday and we, we played his, um, we read rather his tweet the other day during the Dahmer podcast and we were shocked at what everybody was upset about. Now did he said this on the podcast, is that what happened with twitter? Twitter, he tweeted it as a fucking comedian known for being

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       dirty and because he said something about an African American woman, but her whipping him and him coming all over himself, like a fat father. It was just, it was about her disrespecting the plantation. I mean, his tweets were hilarious, but people were so offended that he was kicked off of that midnight show. He couldn't do the midnight show. And then on top of that he, um, he got banned from Espn. He can't go on espn to care of ESPN. Last night he torched espn for ripping him off. He got up, he got it, like a phrase or a bit stolen yet. And so he just, he redid a whole sketch, ripping them. Tasha has this thing called Web redemption, right? Right. Where he's, you know, he watches like famous, like, like videos and just, you know, look, let's get redemption for this lien. And so he meets the people there in the veil.

Speaker 4:          01:44:42       They pretty much exactly did the same thing. And so she's been on there since like six years or something. So they're doing the same thing. They're just calling it a different name. Don't play it, don't play it. It'll get us kicked off of youtube every time, every fucking time. Even though I've got a comedy central special coming out next week, they would still kick us off. You can even play your clip for your comments, especially my clip. They'd pull me off youtube. Not Kidding. Welcome to the world. We live in full charge. I know you signed the paperwork. I don't know what you signed, but I signed some shit that ain't mine no more. There's a lot of motherfuckers out there that want to own everything. God, that's the beauty of the podcast. Full charge. I know. We do whatever we want. You've got a full charge podcast to full charge power.

Speaker 4:          01:45:24       Our very funny. Everybody check it out on you. Sure. It's very funny, very, very funny. Very funny. Nobody believer sees what's the matter. Oh, nothing. Well we not recording. Ah, fuck. I can't hear anything right now. Yeah. The microphone is just not working right now. Oh, but it's recording. Yeah. Yeah. His is recording. So what happens when you park yourself there? Jamie is here. Everything was nice and smoothly. Now. SD cards in the middle of fucking show. I just want to remind people that all the equipment works on the full charge power hour. It's very high. People don't edit it. Actually. Are we fall? Is that what it is? Why don't you guys fucking plan this shit in advance. There's not a lot of things that you guys have to do. This only gets full like once a year. You should just check it. It's not a lot of shit to check here.

Speaker 4:          01:46:12       Just fucking Christ. Yeah. One SD card. So what is this show being recorded? Yeah. Yeah. This is just backup all the time. You spent going to massage parlors, son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. Full charge man. Have a tour coming out or something. Yes I do. It's, um, it's a little west coast tour, San Francisco Doc Ricketts, November 29th, Woodstock, crickets. Doc records used to be the purple onion in north beach and it's a new club now and November 29th. So that's like a really small, intimate room. Didn't get special. Yeah. Yeah. So it's pretty cool. I'd never been there, but uh, I can't wait to play it. And I'm going to be at the analog cafe on December fifth. That's in Portland, Oregon. Beautiful. And I'm going to be at highline in Seattle, Washington on December six and I would love for people to come out and see me.

Speaker 4:          01:47:05       Good Lord. Full charge. How do you do it all? I just, I get to writing. I memorized the jokes, do some stage time company, then I've, then I go to the city. This is. Yeah. Yeah. Do you bring people on the road with you and you're working with Logan? Actually my co host from the full charge power hour, Craig Coleman is going to come open from a code soured alone. Everybody's got a podcast now. It's great. It's gonna come a time when no one wants a television show, you know, like, wow, I kind of like podcasts or in the time for this, too many cooks tomb and what is too many cooks. You guys keep saying this too many cooks. This amazing video that these two guys that work at adult swim has had been making on their own for the last year. I think they're like pas or something.

Speaker 4:          01:47:45       Like I said, they'd been taken like a little bit of money and making this little stealing, stealing project on the site and so they, they got the a 4:00 like info commercial spot on adult swim and it's kind of like a video that's making fun of eighties sitcoms openings by on mushrooms and at first year it's just like this annoying song that starts getting into your head and it's over and over. And then a lot of people just turn it off after like four or five minutes because they are like, I can't take anymore of this. But if you get over the lump of like the four minute mark, it becomes one of the most fucked up, demented. Beautiful videos I've seen on a long weird. It's really weird. Yeah, but there's a lot of that. Tim and Eric Style comedy these days. They just keep going.

Speaker 4:          01:48:29       Yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff out there now I know and especially when you could just make a clip and just throw it up on youtube or throw it up on the Internet and there's so many people that could just do things now. Yeah, it's really cool that they did. They took a chance and overnight it got like 3 million hits in less than 24 hours. That's awesome. That's beautiful man. We live in a great time. So fucking best time ever. It really is. It is. And it really wasn't and it's just so new. All these opportunities is so new, you know? Yeah. Trials and tribulations aside, all this shit about like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches being racist and all this stupidity still awesome. I know the most awesome time. It's just, there's too many people talking. That's all it is. It's weird that people use so much.

Speaker 4:          01:49:12       They use the uh, technology just like complain and stuff. There's creators and there's destroyers, there's whiners, and there's just people that like fucking contribute. There's a lot of distributors out there, but you know what I mean, man. A lot of it is just misplaced energy. I've talked to destroyers. Former destroys her now. Creators. Yeah. Apologize to me. Like for like some shit. They wrote like, I'm sorry, tweeted that out. You are sorry. I said that. I was just blah blah blah. And they want to. They want to be creators, but they don't have the balls or they don't have the experience and then they see you doing it and they get. They put that energy towards you. Yeah. Well there's. Yeah. There's also

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       some people look at other people's success as their failure somehow, like you're detracting from them. Like every time a full charge goes on tour, people back home and go, fucking full charge out there in Portland. Fuck. Now they're pissed. Fuck this man. You know I, I started out that dude. Fuck man. I can't even get booked. Who booked you there, man? He should just call me. That's another beautiful thing about this. I just fucking. I booked the venues myself. Segura said that to me. He's like, this is the thing that people do. That's like the grossest thing guide. How'd you get that? Yeah, I've heard that expression since I started. How'd you get that? How'd you get that? What's the formula? What's the math equation? So I can do it? Yeah. Fucking Ian Edwards just talking about that too. He's like, that's weird shit that people say to you.

Speaker 2:          01:50:32       How'd you get that? Get that. I just called this guy jeff did a lap bro. Super easy. You're writing a fast start talking. It was a million different things combined individual to me and that's how it happened. Million different things. You freak pitches. Yeah. So, um, when you put together these tours are, you're doing this shit with an agent, you're doing it all by yourself. I just do it by myself. That's cool. Yeah. That's a, that's another thing that you can do today that you could never do before. The middle men across the board are getting cut out, which is beautiful. Yeah. And they don't have to be middlemen. It's not like there's not a whole lot of opportunities for other shit to be done. Right. It's just great because of email and twitter. You can have these people that are following me on twitter.

Speaker 2:          01:51:13       I'm like, Oh shit, there's this club that's following the in September and in Portland it's falling out. Just tweet them and see what's up. Exactly. Did you see the video of the, uh, the elephant fighting off? 14 lines on my twitter. Follow it. It's, it's pretty awesome because the elephant winds, elephants just seemed, spoiler. Elephants just seemed so fucking cool. Like it's really kind of hard to believe that people shot them just for their ivory. They just, I mean, I know that they killed people sometimes and storm into villages and stomp everything down, but look, don't hate the player. What game wasn't it? This podcast you guys were talking about how they used to. They electrocuted an elephant as an experiment. Yeah. I'm with Thomas Edison. Did to show the power. No one blogged about it. You can just, you can cook an elephant and Times Square and nobody gives a shit.

Speaker 2:          01:52:07       Back then it was for a, so that video is the advancement that video gets pulled, but if we do like a screenshot, it really goes both ways. Yeah, I'm sure it will. Right? Here's a bunch of fighting over it and then we'll just skip ahead with second. Well, here's what happens. The lions jump on these things back and they try to drag it down and just google it. It's worth watching because it feels good. A young elephant fights 14 lines and wins, but you know what, man, if you shot one of those lines, everybody was super mad at you. If he was sitting there watching, like, imagine this is what happens. You're sitting there watching this elephant getting fucked up by these lines, so you just fucking pull out of your four by four, climb up on the roof,

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       line this motherfucker up and you see this lion's body. You'd be. People would be really pissed at you, dear Internet. I can't believe they shot that line, but if you, you know, if you'll just sit back and let the lions killed the elephant to do you pick a side. Do you pick a side when you see 14 lines trying to kill an elephant? Elephant. You've picked us out to the alpha. I think so too, because elephants are herbivores. They're not predators. Right? But isn't that just how it works, man? If the lions can bring down the elephant to eat it, that's how it works. That's the game plan is not the game. We're all playing. That is the game. They're all planning. Like if, if it's a person like some chick on facebook posing with a deadline, she's the cont. Right? Right. But if the lions take this elephant out there, like the lion had to do it, the chick took a flight over here.

Speaker 1:          01:53:35       She's an asshole. She's just doing this for fun, just like a homo gypsy. But if the chick was there and she was doing it for fun and she saw this and she said, you know what? Fuck these lines. I'm gonna. Kill one of those lines. Would people be angry at her? I think they probably. Would. People pick teams? Yeah. Even when it comes to animals. [inaudible]. That's a little weird. I love lions, but I just know elephants are way fucking smarter than A. Yeah. They can paint. They can paint their face. You know what I'm saying? No, no, no. That'll get us pulled too. But there's a video. If you go and Google it, there's a video of an elephant painting his own portrait or her own portrait. So there's a, there's only the males have the horns. Is that what it is? The tusks? Don't know about that. Would they use only. I'm the only antlered animal that's a female. Um, as far as like, like deer and elk and Caribou. Female Caribou. Have Antlers coming out of the fight off wolves and shit to female elephants. What about female rams? Female Rams. GotTa have horns, right? Otherwise you're not around right now.

Speaker 1:          01:54:42       It's a sheep. Females, sheep rams just swayed on fuck ramps growing up. Both male and female. African elephants have tusks unlocked or Asian relatives. Um. Oh No. I'm not like their ancient relatives. African elephants are not easily domesticated in incorrect sentence. I only had to click on it here. So yeah, they both have tusks. You guys hear about these cat dicks. They have little knives in them. They all have good nights. Yeah. They stick in like a bb fishing the fishing for pussy. Get cat calls. You ever heard cat cat screaming every night? Yeah. It sounds like they're fighting. You hear it night. I have a lot of feral cat in my neighborhood. Did Gypsies brought on. That's what happens man. When you live in a neighborhood where people just let their cats out and then they. They like people like let their cats free.

Speaker 1:          01:55:39       Especially male cats. Most people don't want to get their mail. Cats fixed. It's paying the asset of the money and so just let the little cute ball you want to look at. It's weird because you could tell that there was a couple of the cats that are just like they don't have homes, but then there's cats because I live in a nicer neighborhood that are mixed with like Persian cats that have callers and you're like, it's a gangs of cats though and at night they just fucking hanging out on your car where you rarely see a cat with his balls and really see a male cat with balls. If you go over people's houses, their cats, their male cats are always neutered because if you're your male cat is annuity pisses everywhere. Right? Back up and Piss on your wall. This is mine and you can't stop them there.

Speaker 1:          01:56:15       You're going to do it. I had a cat do it. I had my feral cat. I don't know if you ever met him. Do you ever meet Jack Dempsey? Was the all black cat? I don't think they'll kill them. Yes. Yes, I did. Frank Sinatra. The pit bull told them was awful. He just got cocky one too many times with the dog. He's a. It was a fierce little cat, but he. I had him neutered, but um, it's very rare that you find one that's not neutered, you know, that my cat was feral, like I got him. He was a couple months old and my friend Lanie had rescued him and it was a total disaster. It was, I should never done it. But when I brought him home, he's pissing everywhere. Man. He's picking his ass up and trying to piss on the walls. When I had to bring him to the vet to get them, uh, get them neutered, I literally had a throw a bathrobe over them and tackle them in the bathroom. I trapped them in the bathroom and he was like, hissing at me, climbing up the drapes. I'm like, listen motherfucker, I'm not going to kill you. I love you. Just here to take you to the vet. If I picked him up once I picked them up and start preparing like instantly,

Speaker 1:          01:57:16       like he would know that I was okay once I picked them up, but on the way to pick them up and, but fucking scramble up the walls and it's run from me. It was the funniest shit ever. And then I would, when I first adopted him, I slept with him in a room for like several days, just me and him in the room. I pushed a bed into this room. I had a spare bedroom. Uh, I pushed a push some books in there and like how to keep shutting the door real quick so he couldn't run out. I put them in there, put a litter box in there and put some food in there and just hung out with him just so he totally got used to me. And when I come near them, even like after he, I picked him up a bunch of times. I come here, I'm going to run across the walls. He was a little tiny thing man. But when I finally would get them

Speaker 4:          01:58:05       right,

Speaker 1:          01:58:06       but as long as I kept a hold of him, he was cool. But as soon as I put them down, fucking started hitting, running away. Wrong

Speaker 4:          01:58:13       cat noises, man. You got that down man. That guy was nuts, man. I had all black cat when I was a kid. What do you think my mother named this cat face? Sam. Sambo. Sambo, nice parents you got there, don't react to people fucking and named the cat racist, but those are too fucked up things. That's very fucked up. Why Sambo? What does sambo? Sambo is reference to a chain

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       of restaurants. I guess 100 years ago, it's very. That aunt Jemima minstrel show. Cartoonish. A minstrel. Not Menstrual, right? I don't know what I'm saying. The racist thing. Um, but it's very like black face. And there was a chain of restaurants called Sam Bose. Um, my mom said there was like a black guy in the Bible named sambo, but I don't think that's true. I don't think that's true. Will Your Parents Bible thumpers? No. No, no. They like, they're like Catholic, so they're not really into it. They're just guilted into going every week. Yeah. Catholic is a different kind of relationship. Yeah. That's why you'd never see Catholic suicide bomber had this whole bit about it because no Catholics believe in it that much. Exactly. They just know they have to go there, guilted into it. The whole deal. Did you hear about the fucking tiger that's loosened France? Yeah. There's a real tiger loose in France, like someone thought it was a links or something like that and they got a photo of it and then they realize like, oh shit, this is a tiger. There's a young male tiger wandering around Paris. Jesus Christ. That's romantic. That's fucking terrifying. Isn't it? Full American Werewolf in London. No, American tiger.

Speaker 2:          01:59:55       There's no this. There's more tigers in Texas than there are in the wild. Didn't know that. You know what I say? Good. I like Texas and tigers can go fuck themselves. That's what I say. I think we got a win win situation here. I like it. Are there any tigers in Mexico? Like is it just Texas? No. Mexico has Jaguars. Gotcha. Tiger on the loose in Paris, suburbs. People told stay inside. You think fucking look at that guy. He's dead. They're going to grab the back of his head and Disneyland. Paris, strong cat noises. Fucking horrible. Horrible feeling. It must be to just feel that thing biting down on the back of your head and know you'd be so great at reading books to kids like, like, like, like, like a classroom of kids, like a book about animals. You would blow that shit out of the park.

Speaker 2:          02:00:49       I do. Um, I did read one book on tape once you remember the book. Was there any animal story? No, no. It's just, you know, I just had to be dramatic. It was a little kids book because a book for little kids. I love reading to my kids though. I get really. We read the Gruffalo yeah. Or Cat in the hat. I'm a bad motherfucker. I do the different voices and shit. Yeah. They love it to make me read the same books over and over and over again. Kids are weird, man. They want to watch the same shows. My daughter has watched frozen no less than 100 times. Like my four year old can sing the words.

Speaker 5:          02:01:24       Yeah, I,

Speaker 2:          02:01:26       they, they just want to see the same shit over and over and over again. The like Jamie with interstellar want to see the same shit over and over is a little weird that like books are still interesting to kids too. I mean imagination. Yeah, it's. You

Speaker 3:          02:01:39       know what? These guys are called. No. Bernstein bears. Berenstein bears. Whereas my mom used to call them the sambo bears. That's a. here's a weird thing. These aren't. These are not called the Berenstein bears. What are they called? The berenstain bears. S t a I n, but for some reason everybody thinks that's Bernstein, including myself, but yeah, growing up, we used to always call him the berenstain bears, but look at the name. It's so weird. Weird fucking bear family will eat your asshole

Speaker 1:          02:02:10       monsters, but everybody wants to think are cute. There's a bear thing is so strange, man. That's the weirdest thing that people have an attachment to because bears are fucking. They don't give a shit about you. Kill you as soon as they made 100 percent. The only reason why they're not like when people run into bears and they're not killing them, it's because they have other food it just ate or something that they have on. They have some. They a bunch of salmon. They have some berries that they ate. They don't need to eat you. What about panda bears? Vicious rapist. Horrible racists. Pandas are the worst.

Speaker 3:          02:02:42       Koala bears. Very lot of sexually transmitted disease. Chlamydia, like for real. They call bears transmitted sexually transmitted disease to each other or they die. People, I think.

Speaker 6:          02:02:52       Where'd you get the clap? I never cheat on you with people. It was so cute and then you just start fucking man.

Speaker 3:          02:02:58       Yeah, it's weird. Koala bears. Yeah, it's that. It's killing them though. Like as a. It really is threatening the funny to take them out.

Speaker 1:          02:03:08       Lydia, the std threatening and Australian icon. Let's take them down to planned parenthood. That gets of. Here's the thing, man. We're so funny. What we want to keep them around. You know, we have this idea that we are in charge somehow or another. Make sure that animals don't go extinct and the like a Koala bear needs to stay around. Like does it really? I mean I don't think we should go kill them all. Okay. I don't think that, but if they all died because of fucking herpes. Yeah. I think maybe we should concentrate on poor people before we concentrate on herpes. Written Koala bears. Dude, you're writing crazy sensible when it comes to that shit. You can accidentally get an std from. That's what you should have. You should have called bears in your house that way. You always have a built in.

Speaker 6:          02:03:55       You should. You should get a fucking Koala. It's not what you think. Connie baby. Look, I'm going to show you the article on Google pdf. File your house in Edu address. Your House has just tanning beds and just so you have an out of shit that can give you stds. Has anybody ever really gotten to a tanning bed? Venereal disease? I have no idea. I didn't. I know this is

Speaker 3:          02:04:25       first I'm hearing of this. Yeah, you can get. Supposedly you can get herpes from a tanning bed. Get herpes from a toilet seat, you know you can use. My sister used to. Oh, I got it from my sister. Used to own a tanning bed in Boston

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       in a business that she started crying and she said the problem was girls would masturbate inside of them and they had to clean it.

Speaker 4:          02:04:43       She does. Sometimes she could smell it. She would go in there. You could smell it. These chicks just been fingering themselves, whether in their tanning. Keep it in your coffee, girl you been off in the tangent because especially since the beats off everywhere else that worked there, they're all pretty high and Tan and they're all girls that worked there. So you, you come in, you're just like, you know, she's just right on the other side of this little like little cheap door. So you're just like naked or going, why not? I'm just going to beat it up and it's always those hollow shitty doors shut them. Clung, Echo. It's like this barely anybody could just punch their hand through that door. The shade design, you know like the shades, like the window shade design where you can actually see through it. So if you walk past one you can see like a second, you could see a woman like laying there.

Speaker 4:          02:05:30       So yeah, that's Kinda crazy. Like you're naked and you're compressed in this thing that puts a light on you that comes from metal, glass tubes. Like how weird are people man lying there and you got little goggles on and shit. But you're buttholes this but hold the glass and you get that Weird Tan spot where you get a little white spot in between your ass cheeks because your cheeks compressed when you lie there. So like I would try to spread my ass cheeks while we're in there to make sure that I got some tanning on that one area at tech. My Dick though in between. So I don't want my Dick Tam for some reason. It never needs a 10 but it could make it look bigger. Sure.

Speaker 1:          02:06:08       I don't know if it does. It doesn't. I don't think it was bigger than their white. Isn't that why overweight people like to wear black? Black is slimming. That's why black dicks are so impressive and seem like Jesus Christ. Imagine if it was white. Imagine if you had a white Dick was all white and it was giant. A big fucking albino. Brock lesnar styled Dick. Do you think that would be fantastic? I don't think it has little anything. Who giant shits please. The giant human. What's going to have this little? His little pinky shack has a small Dick. I don't buy that for a second. I lack shack has probably got an enormous Dick. He's just so big that it probably looks normal sized on him. He's seven foot tall. It's huge. That guy. So big man. I, I've stood next to him on a bunch of occasions, shook his hand. Shit. He always comes by and says hi. He's a big UFC fan and when you put your hand in his to do that, that bro handshake and you know this, this one who do like that on my hand just disappears. Like I'm shutting my hand on a like a refrigerator. It's a giant hand. He's an enormous man. Sticks probably probably fucking huge.

Speaker 4:          02:07:19       Probably exactly what it is. It's probably so big that it just probably just looks normal compared to him. I mean, look at that. Let's get the fuck Outta here. You're telling me that guy's got a little dick. I think he's walking next to his dick. Just stick. Please stop it. How is it possible that God has a little Dick? God, can you

Speaker 1:          02:07:35       imagine him? Even though it was small for his size, it's 10 inches. Can I imagine him? Fuck that. Brian, you just crossed the line? No, I mean like the size difference. It's just ridiculous. Just murder her baby. Take it. Some girls just so he ain't working out no more. Huh? Is that what that picture is all about? Is that looks checkup that. Well, big dudes like that. That is a reality of life. I don't live that long. They all. We're saying, okay, so tall guys want to. Someone were saying that backwards and that still makes me freak out. Imagine if a girl had a guy like that. You would imagine the girls just stuffing that guy in her pussy. Just making them Peter out from the g spot, just a shack she like only goes out with guys who can hold their breath. How long can you hold your breath?

Speaker 1:          02:08:24       Could hold my breath for like three minutes. Show me okay on Ge. The inside of my pussy for three minutes each. The g spot? Well there's certain animals that have absorbed the mail after they breed a black widow. Yeah. There's a bunch of a bunch of bugs that kill the male after. After they breed. I think females do too. I think praying mantis do, don't they? Yeah. I think there's a bunch of. A bunch of bugs that do that. Black widows do the. There's quite a few. There's one aunt where they take the mail and they bite all of his fucking limbs off. Like the male is like bigger and they take them and they bite all of his legs and wings off and then they bring them to the hive and then they make them breed. That's weird that there's this society where like that's all the males are good for.

Speaker 1:          02:09:12       I don't think it's the society. Well, you know what I mean, it's crazy little and it's a group that's the real danger about spaceman is that like a starship trooper style. You could land somewhere and there's giant bugs like that. That's, that's the reality. Like we're lucky to have plugs are fucking little man. No kidding. They live with us. I mean they are in our world. I, I found a praying mantis the other day and I got a video of this. My daughter found it and I put it on her hand and then she was holding it and they try to get you and stuff, but they can't get you there, you know, they can get like a bug or a hummingbird or something like that, but they really can't get a person and we put it on this, this branch and just right where we put it just by total luck.

Speaker 1:          02:09:54       It was a bunch of ants crawling on the branch and just starts eating the ants. Wow. Just picking him up and eating them while sitting there and they were going, oh my God, he's eating. The aunts were like, Whoa, this is so cool. And I tried to video it, but it's just hard to like get that in, you know, but uh, that's going on right now. You know what I'm saying? Like that is a reality of life. Now, if that thing was as big as a giraffe and the answer to the size of pigs and you open your window, you looked out there and you see this fucking eating paste the pigs can and try to get away. We would live in a horrific environment. That's like starship troopers. Like the only difference between that and you know, and, and our reality is that these bugs are small, right? But there bugs, man bugs. They have a Dev, no motions yet. As far as we know, they, they lived this very alien, almost mechanical life there. They're like similar to like robots. They're like a little weird robotic alien creature that lives side by side with us. It's just so small we don't think about. It isn't a word. The, Oh, like the see all their friends getting eaten and they don't react to it, but they just walk right into the walk right into it because they're programmed. They're not

Speaker 3:          02:11:06       like, I almost think like in the future way, thousands of years we're going to find out the bugs and stuff are actually completely way more advanced than us and that, you know, like, look at hummingbirds that doesn't look like nature, that it looks like a fucking jet fighter. It's, that does not seem like the same thing as a snail.

Speaker 1:          02:11:25       Well, can you imagine if someone could figure out a way to make a military aircraft that can maneuver like a hummingbird, like a large military occur, ethical, like what they can do is incredible. The ways that we can move back and forth and all around,

Speaker 3:          02:11:40       Hey, have a hummingbird feeder outside my house and had tons of hummingbirds and if you have the new iphone, it has that slow motion video thing. It's really good.

Speaker 1:          02:11:50       Cool. That's dope. Yeah, they're beautiful, man.

Speaker 3:          02:11:54       That's funny. That's one thing I noticed about, again, I watched the CEO video again last night and just how bad camera phones were for, uh, for motion picture. Oh yeah. Like at the end of the video it's like really, you know, that's an e eight, 15. That's A. Yeah. Lg or Motorola made have been right before the razor, I think it was, but it was that one that you flip open and it was like the first camera phone that did video and it was the ones that you flipped open and it was side. Oh no, it wasn't. It wasn't the envy. It was way before the envy. This was the first video phone which was on verizon and my battery died when I did them and see if there's [inaudible] there's like an extra two hours that they've never been seen. But then my, my, it died and so then I was like, fuck, what do I do? Oh my camera phone. So the last part where Steve is easy and all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:12:44       Wow. That's crazy that, that was just a short amount of time ago. But if we ever landed on another planet and found bugs, like big giant bugs like that, you know, what a mind fuck that would be. Have you landed on some planet? And it was enormous. Dinosaur size praying mantises running around. They attack the drone. Like we landed drone somewhere and it fucking picks up the drone and crushes it, starts sucking the batteries out of it,

Speaker 3:          02:13:09       or if it had all the same animals and people and stuff, but mixed together weird like humans were like in love with ostriches or something like that. This,

Speaker 1:          02:13:19       what about a species specific meeting wasn't necessarily that everything fucked everything. Hybrids. Everywhere you looked like dog hybrids. You can fucking. You can fucking anything you wanted and every. Whenever you fuck something, it would make a combination like everybody get everybody pregnant, including animals. Get people pregnant. That'd be so much fun. So cool. We'd be in the old comedy. That little bear you get herpes out of it, but it'd be worth it. It would be figuring out a way to make a weapon to protect your butthole everywhere you. Every time you left the house, something will be trying to fuck you and get you pregnant and then you try to tell people about this planet and all they care about is your fucking tee shirt. Imagine how much.

Speaker 1:          02:13:57       Imagine how much more sensitive we would all be to each other if we could. All get pregnant if it was universal, if everybody got pregnant, I wouldn't trust anybody. Like if there was no disparity. Sleep. Think about how much disparity there is and like physical strength and ability. Like we were looking at Shaquille o'neal and his wife. Obviously he's just so much bigger and stronger than her. Right, but what if everybody was the exact same size, like all people are the exact same size and everybody could get everybody. Now you're talking. What? What would the reality of this world bait? Would there be more people or less people will depend on our urges, right? We have the same urges. It's probably the same amount of people. We just figured out a way to deal with the fact that we're just going to fuck each other. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:14:39       I think it would be relatively the same amount of people because most. I'd say most children come from a a mutual relationship. We'll just think about how many people back in the Roman days, how many men went gay because they were just off on campaign together in there, but fucking fees, Musky unshaven shit. Smeared assholes have soared murderer. No babies should be born that way. I mean this is not a love child. The reason why they went case because back then they didn't have anything to clean their pussies and then he just smelled really, really bad like pussy smell and dude's ass hole unless you're shooting out of your pussy because you can wipe the outside of your butthole out. But like there's just like shit dying in those pussies some. I think some of it probably smelled great. I bet people you know, like people are not supposed to be like washing with soap, you know, they said that they say that like when you wash with like one of the things a big mistake people make when they do Jujitsu, don't take a shower right before you go to class.

Speaker 1:          02:15:38       Right. You actually shouldn't. You should like limit your showering to about two hours before class because when you shower it takes about a half an hour. Supposedly from the stuff I've read, obviously I'm no expert for your body's natural flora to start to replenish itself. So if you go get scratched or you do something where you're going to be in physical contact with someone, uh, then you take a shower first, you have a higher likelihood of you not having the skin flora to fight off any potential. Weird Shit. That's interesting because I always shave after I shower. We can do that. Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean it's different. We're talking about Jujitsu. No, that's not the same as shaving. It's almost like an injury. What are you doing when you're shaving? I always cut myself. I'm sorry. I guess I missed, you know, Jujitsu. You get staph infections and funk.

Speaker 1:          02:16:29       Gotcha to ground. So I think the point being that a woman's natural flora, like the natural bacteria in her body, that's why one of the reasons why women supposedly are more susceptible to yeast infections when they take antibiotics because antibiotics kills all the bacteria. The good stuff too. And so they can get the poster form and there's a smell. And this is not any woman's fault. Okay. This is just unfortunate, but there's a smell that is capable of coming out of a vagina that until you smell it, you can't believe it, and when you do smell it and you go, how is this possible? How is it possible that the human body, what is, what is the human body? St will warn you. He's trying to say this is good, right? Don't go down there. How come? If that's the case, why doesn't hurt me smell? I don't know. It should. How come? Yeast infection smell, but why doesn't venereal disease isn't a person smell again.

Speaker 4:          02:17:31       And how can dog sometimes smell cancer? That's what they train them to smell cancer. Did you hear about this guy that recently lost his hearing and he can now only here like Wifi signals wherever he goes, he's almost deaf, but it's driving him crazy because he can only hear Wifi signals. Whoa. That sounds like hell on her. Well, you know, they say that bees can hear cell phone signal's really. Is that where they're dying off? There's that. And there's also pesticides, like, um, they have a bunch of bs, died off really recently, like millions of bees and it coincided with the production of some genetically modified crop that resist pesticides was real recent story. I'll pull it up. That's why these a big gossipy lately. And bees bees going extinct as a way bigger problem than say Koala bears go extinct. Right?

Speaker 1:          02:18:23       Yeah, man. Yeah. Yeah. These are really, really a big issue. When, when bees die, it's not good at all. Trying to find the most recent shit. It's,

Speaker 4:          02:18:34       it's a very recent story you've ever met a guy that collected butterflies? No, the pins in the box. I was just seeing that like in movies and shit, but I've never seen anyone actually do it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:47       A man who can hear Wifi wherever you will. There's insecticides that they're blaming on killing off bs. I think apparently the Wifi signals and the, um, any like radio signals and cell phone signals, they all have the potential to disrupt the natural communication methods that a lot of insects use and beads especially are sort of susceptible to a cell phone signals the flux with them. Yeah, millions of bees. Did I to find this be used to because they were trying to figure out what it was. Why did $37 million bees fall out of the air? Thirty 7 million. Man, that's pretty crazy. And they're, they're trying to put it together. But some people of course are connecting it with genetically modified corn. So as the shock incident came just weeks after genetically modified corn was planted in Ontario, according to the local honey gatherers beekeeper, Dave Schultz lost about $37 million bees, which is around 600 hives. Whoa. Urban homestead, honey.com is where he, uh, he did this interview. He said once the corn started to get planted, our bees died by the millions that collapsed in the local honeybee population is called why caused widespread concern with many pointing to pesticides as the cause in the decline of colonies. Yet supposedly they were making a comeback though. Some recent reports like this one says, after decline, honey bears are appear to making honey bees. Honey bees.

Speaker 1:          02:20:22       Bigger bus kids need. Um, yeah man, I don't know. You know, it's like when people fuck with nature like that and you start messing around adding pesticides and pesticide resistant plants and you start fucking with what that plan is and then these be started dying. You know, I'm, I mean I'm all for.

Speaker 1:          02:20:48       I'm all for people trying to improve things, but the, this, this seems like a complete disaster if that's what it actually turns out to be doing it. That's scary shit too man. That someone could just invent something like that. Thirty 7 million bees can die. Like instantly. Yeah. That we're capable of doing that. It was just total unintended consequence of creating this pesticide resistant plant. You plant it and then just everything dies dear start fucking stiff leg and in the middle of the street and you don't even fall from the sky. You don't really know how it happened. Yeah, because birds eat the insects and insects eat the pesticides and all the shit just comes together and then you get cancer from eating the birds and you're promoting pseudoscience. Man. Why don't you just stand those anti-vaccine man? You're anti science. I think it's actually, there's science in $37 million bees dying right after genetically modified corn is being planted. I think there's probably like science to be had there. I think so. I feel like if you studied it and you analyze the data,

Speaker 1:          02:21:58       just the idea of being a b is pretty fucking trippy. Living with a bunch of other assholes. Yeah. Making this weird fucking geometric pattern with little cubicles and everybody lives in these cubicles and they all know how to do it. They all know no bees come along with. They forget the old ways and I had to make hives every year. They figured out how to make homes and then that queen can't. She goes around stabbing all the female babies. The Queen Bee is the only one that doesn't have a retractable removable her. Her little pincher, her little, her little pussy nail that she has down there. Her Stinger doesn't go out. She can stinky all day. Right. And the reason why so that she can murder female babies. So she goes near the hive, sniffs out when she smells a female one in the actual steps. That shit out of it.

Speaker 1:          02:22:46       She's stabbing babies so she doesn't get it. It can be born so she doesn't get overthrown by a female. Exactly. Because there can be only one. It's like highlander which goes around with their sword pussy and just starts stabbing little little baby females in their box before they even get hatched and they spend their whole lives just making honey. Huh? And they could be the size of horses. It's more humane way. Imagine. Oh fuck that match. If they were like elephants, big conti flying elephants. That stang babies would be. Would we still be so kind? If they gave us honey now. Fuck honey. At that point in fighter jets after those bitches, you hae a batch. Would have been due to a fighter jet though. Probably just grab it and rip it apart for b. was the size of an elephant. It probably just throw jets out of the sky. Just grab bitch. Stick a Stinger right through it. Take you to a volcano. We see fucking live video. The pilot screaming is the bees flew him over the volcano and drop them in.

Speaker 1:          02:23:49       I hope we never get to this point. I really do. What do you think we would do if if insects started getting bigger? They just kept getting bigger and you know how like every year it gets a little warmer as well. First I'd panic and not know what the fuck did though. How long would it take before we would act if bees started getting like that big of bees started getting that big and if kids kids, what I'm holding up is a coffee stirrer that's probably about. Was at about four inches. Five inches. Yeah. Four or five inches. Imagine the. Okay, let's go. Six managers. Six inch bees. Would we still tolerate that? No. No, no fucking way. I would find a way to cook them. They'll be like little lobsters. Vicious, but they're great. What if they look soft? Shell crabs. Then I'm eating them. Problem solve.

Speaker 1:          02:24:35       Well, they're edible. I know that puts some old bay on that shit. I'm pretty sure we made me bleed bees. I know we did actually. Yeah, that will. That's A. I'm Asian Hornet. That's a hornet. They kill bees. We've actually showed that video before and it also got us pulled from youtube. When did you start getting pulled from youtube? Like crazy man. People have copyrights on all these videos, especially nature videos, which we being the retards that we are watching and whether they have those and they put those on youtube, they own the video. So if you play it in, even if it's fair use you play and do commentary on it and even tell people to go to see it on youtube. Big still have a copyright call on you and they pull your video down, but it's not. It's not like you're doing anything illegal.

Speaker 1:          02:25:20       It is actually fair use. Look at the image of that thing. Jesus Christ. Okay. That's probably like three inches long, right? That's a God damn bug to three at about three inches long. Half that guy's hand, right? About three inches too. So I know what size my Dick is guys. Guys, Hey, now that's about three inches. That's a fucked up bug. But if they were like a foot long, we'd have to start taking them out. We wouldn't tolerate it if they were killing babies and shit. If they were bird size, pigeon size, it'd be war against the bees. Fuck honey. Fuck. Any repercussions of those fucks. Oh, we're already there. One of those things. What are they called? Uh Oh. We're looking at bees that are like cell phones. Those are like cell phone size piece already. That's a STARTAC. Motorola STARTAC.

Speaker 7:          02:26:07       A

Speaker 1:          02:26:11       Asian giant Hornet Asian giant Hornet. Fuck that. No wonder the jumping off buildings in Asia. That's bullshit. Jesus Christ, his horn. Hornet will be the last day before he died. Oh my God. And that easily could, you know, staying the shit out of you and ruin your week. Yeah. Sting. You're writing your dick hole climbs on your and you were inside your whole. You wake up screaming in the. You can't get the Stinger out because as the Hornet dies, it pulls out and you'll see the Stinger. It's in there with the tweezers are too big and you can't get it, but you still take a picture of it because your Dick is swollen because it makes it look better. It makes it look bigger tech by giant Hornets, the eight holes through his arm. What? I'm never going outside. But is that from the venom? From being stung? Yeah, but go to the actual page itself and see if that's like if the venom erodes your skin tissue or something like bullet holes.

Speaker 1:          02:27:13       Nature. Scariest. Fuck Dude. When I was up in Canada this week, is that what it is in the stink and dissolve human tissue, so not cool. The more we learn, the more scared I am. Dude, go to the outside world, go to my instagram and check out the picture of the cow, the calf rather the moose calf that got torn apart by wolves that we found when we were in British Columbia. We're up in British Columbia and there's a lot of wolves up there a lot. Look at this. Holy Shit. We came upon that. It was only like a day or so old because there was still meat on the bones and they're still like, like the tissue, like the meat tissue around the legs. That was still there, like wasn't rotten at all. So it was a pretty, pretty recent kill and there was hair, all that white stuff that you see on the ground, that's all hair.

Speaker 1:          02:28:05       Geez. All that stuff that you see, it looks like feathers. That's all moose hair. And they uh, the wolves had drawn a calf and calves are huge. A wall, like I'm a moose calf is like the size of a big deer, like they're really big and just tore this thing apart and we came upon it whatever a day, two days after they did it and we came upon it because the Guy Mike, that was the guy that we were with, he saw crows flying overhead. So it's like, let's go find out what these guys are eating right. And we could smell it as we got closer, but it's just so eerie to be right there where you know, that some wolves were like howling and ripping apart this thing and he was still alive. The. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well the horror of all that shit.

Speaker 1:          02:28:51       This guy who was there said that this Guy Mike said that his friend had found a moose that had lived for three days, why wolves were eating it's ass and somehow stayed alive and in shock, and when they came upon the happened, it took three days and they were there when it first started and they didn't step in. They didn't intervene and the wolves I can and they came back two and a half days later. That's fucking Moose was still alive. Then shock while the wolves were like eating its legs and its asset end because if they eat it slowly, like it just goes into shock and it didn't die like he has no idea how it stayed alive, but it was alive for three fucking days before they finally killed it. So they were just feeding off of it while it was still alive. And oftentimes they eat it from the ass first.

Speaker 1:          02:29:37       For whatever reason, they have a natural instinct to take out the back legs because the hamstring you, when they take out the back legs, you can't run away and then just start eating you. And so there's this, there's this crazy video of these two deer that had gotten into a fight. They were like clashing antlers together. And when they clashed antlers together, they got stuck. Sometimes this happens, deer get stuck and they can't. They can't get away and they're like, they're moving around, their antlers are so interlocked, they literally pulling apart and they can't. So the coyotes ate one of them while the other one was still alive. And so there's this video of these two deer stuck together and one of the deer is dead and these hunters had found it and it had asshole first. So these, this pack of coyotes got ahold of the one deer was eating it asshole first, while the other deer was like, move in and flip and attached to the rest of the carcass is this deer.

Speaker 1:          02:30:31       So they finally went over and they separated the two of them. And then the one deer, they let them go and then they took photos and videos, the deer that it was all fucked up, but it had literally eating it. Asshole first. Jesus Christ. Man. I can't imagine. I mean the other deer is alive. Yeah. Well this is happening. Yeah. Fuck man. Nature is a scary. So there's a bunch of coyotes in Griffith Park. Fuck yeah, there are. I see them running around all the time. Be like they go into the neighborhoods and stuff. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. As long as they have food, you're okay. Right. But as soon as they run out of rabbits and squirrels and shoot to kill and cats and dogs and they start going into the suburbs, they start looking around for other shit he buries too. Sometimes he'll come across like coyote shit that's filled with berries, which I was.

Speaker 1:          02:31:15       I thought it was weird. I didn't know that coyotes weren't totally carnivores and I'd never heard that. So just now. Do you think you could eat a coyote if you had to stay alive? If I had to. It sounds like a lot of work though and I don't know if I really know how to do it. Do I have a knife? How to kill it? You mean I have a knife and do I have fire one thing? Yeah, you have fire and yes. You have a knife because you have to gut it. Okay. Then. Yeah, I could do it. You don't want to cook it with the guts in tact.

Speaker 8:          02:31:43       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          02:31:45       Right. Yeah. No, I mean you got to take, you got gut. You got to skin it, you got to cook it. That's the world of nature, man. And you've got to eat it and then you're, you know. Then you got to do it again tomorrow. The full charge. Have you ever thought about going hunting? Um, I went hunting one time. I shot a bird. What kind of, I don't know. Did you eat it? No, it was terrible. It was a terrible thing to do and I felt horrible and I moved on with my life. It was a shotgun. The bird had no chance whatsoever. That's a weird thing. People say, why don't you make it fair? You can't. We can't make it fair. Dude. A beaver will kill you if you try to make it fair. Right? Beaver will fuck you up. Like you can't use your hands and you have to like get on the ground trying to bite it.

Speaker 1:          02:32:27       I think that the beaver will, when they eat trees with their face, how are you going to kick a beaver's asked now you got to use a weapon. Yeah. You're not going to win. There's no fair. Nothing's fair. We should have fucking shotguns for this shit. People want to like that. This one thing that people want to say like, why don't you make it fair? To make it fair, we would have to be like a 50 slash 50 proposition that you would die and that the animal would kill you. Yeah. Fifty slash 50. The animal will die. 50 slash 50. You would die. It's not going to happen. Why would an animal is going to win? Why would you do that? That seems so stupid. It seems like such. That's distorting what's going on because we ultimate fighting with animals. Are we eating them? Like what's going on?

Speaker 1:          02:33:06       We're eating though. I mean do we have animal weight classes? Like you know, like we have to find out like what was our will fuck up a 20 pound house cat? If I get ahold of it, it'll probably scratch me up. But the bottom line is if I can get ahold of it and get its back legs just bashed his head on the ground, I'm going to kill that cat most likely with my hands. But a 30 pound cat, he might fuck me up a 40 pound cat. I'm going to be really scared of 50 pound cat will probably kill me. Yeah. Fifty pound cat will most likely kill me. So you'd have to like for, for fairness sake, you'd have to have like a 35 pound cat fight. Right? Or normal person do trust me. But I tell you that I was scared of this kitten that I had. Feral kitten. I'm telling you man, when when the shit goes down and cats are fighting for their lives, a 30 pound, 35 pound cat will give you a beating. We'll look at that report or that video. The reporter then they kept going up the record, his leg and two, they'll fuck you up man. They live in a totally different world of movement. They live in a world of superhuman athleticism. Yeah. You know, a 35 pound cat as a formidable foe. 30 five pound pit bull is a dangerous little dog. You versus a kangaroo fighting.

Speaker 2:          02:34:17       Trying to kick my ass. Kangaroo would kick my ass. The only way I'd be able to beat a kangaroo is if it didn't understand not to give up. It's back. I mean if there's somehow or another that I could scramble with the kangaroo, like you would try to kick me and I would know it's going to try to kick me so I get out of the way an arm drag it. I'd have to arm drag it and have to take it's back. Okay. No Jujitsu. Only a kickboxing I would lose. Most likely. Didn't Woody Allen box a kangaroo? No. Tiny man. He did. And digital's children? No, he blocks the kangaroo in like the sixties on the tonight show or something. Come on. I'm serious. Brian, can I get some help? I'll look it up real quick. Um, you remember the old looney tune kangaroo? It was always a boxer. The boxing gloves. Well they definitely have kangaroo boxing. Yeah. I mean I've seen that. I've seen videos of that. Oh, what are y'all in boxing a kangaroo. God, how do you not get hurt but you don't play. This is going to get us pulled. I don't know. Can you think? 60 six. Let's find out

Speaker 6:          02:35:18       tonight on hippodrome. You're gonna. Watch me fight the Australian light. Heavyweight champion.

Speaker 9:          02:35:27       Boxed warning. Oh my God. It really is a cane. This is so funny. If you tried to do this today, if you tried to do this today, people would say that. This is like animal cruelty. I'm going to blog about this right now. Look at him moving around. Wow. I can't believe this is real. That that fucking kangaroos going to Jack Him. He actually moves pretty God damn good. Yeah, he does that. And Woody Allen box before they say it was a good athlete. I'm telling you, man, he's moving pretty good. That's not a guy kicked him. Wow. The guys pushing them into it. That's just fucking fucked up. This is good writing, right? Punch that guy behind him here. That kangaroos dead. Because if he does that shit to me, I'm taking this back. I guarantee you that kangaroo has zero choke defense. You need to update this bit, Joe.

Speaker 2:          02:36:24       Dude, he's moving well. Yeah. Just to kick it, you're not allowed to kick and box a kangaroo because that made me start kicking. I don't want to take them.

Speaker 9:          02:36:30       You don't want to take them. See that? That's what I'm saying. He can hurt you, man. They hurt you. Oh God, baby. Jesus, believe that they grab you and kick you spit on the ground. Whoa. Keep it going man. I want to say fuck that kangaroo up right there. That's good.

Speaker 2:          02:36:50       Dead Kangaroo right there. If I get that position, I'm throwing the hooks in. I'm riding his back. He's not going to know what's up. I'll choke the shit out of a kangaroo. Yeah, I changed the position. If I was that guy in the suit, I'm killing that kangaroo with my hands. That's just how it's gone down. What can you do? I would never be in that position. I would never fucking buck. I think it's cool as shit, man. Isn't that funny? He such like known as such an intellectual comedian that woody. Yeah. And then he just, and then he just fights a kangaroo is a bit. It's not his idea. Obviously. It might've been. He was young. I seems fake. Piss and vinegar. It seems like fun. Dude. Seems terrifying. You Woody Allen moves pretty good. I'm pretty impressed. I bet he boxed. I really do. I, he's definitely into something.

Speaker 2:          02:37:33       The way he moved. He's always talking about fights and going to fights. He didn't move like a, uh, like there's some guys that go to boxercise, like Bryan county goes to this place box and burn going. You get a lot of these executives that have never barks a day in their life and they're in there at like drawing these ridiculously uncoordinated punches and it's comical to watch. But that, that was not that. Like the way he was moving. Yeah. He looked like he knew what he was doing. Would you fight Woody Allen today? A Yes for a lot of money or whatever. How much? How much publicity stunt to fight woody Allen. But if you fucked him up, I, I'd back off. There'd be a ref you back off if you had them. Right. If I were talking about like a boxing match, right, whatever you want to do, how do you want to do it?

Speaker 2:          02:38:14       You could do it. Tom. Post little funny looking glass and rope. Claude van Damme. I wouldn't want referees. I wanted to be like a civil fight. I wouldn't wanna I wouldn't wanna beat up with woody allen too bad. But like you're saying, he looked like he knew what he was doing and I don't know what I'm doing so who knows? But I think I could take them, but he's older now and I think we can take them. Yeah. And pushed both the public shame. There's experience. Probably fuck with the psyche. Like he doesn't deserve to win. I would fight him for money, but I wouldn't want to hurt him. I like him. Oh, that's sweet. Do you still like them even though, you know, he's kind of a creeper. Uh, that really creeps me out actually. But I still kinda like his, uh, his movies and stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:38:52       Yeah. It's not a weird thing with the guy like woody Allen. It's like, you know, you gotta you still like Roman Polanski. People still support him as an artist, but then you find out he drugged and fucked a 13 year old. No, it's horrible. What Rosemary's baby wasn't that good that I'm fucking sticking up for Roman Polanski, but. But woody, I don't know. I have a greater connection to, but I'm also completely grossed out by the idea. It's basically a step kid that he raised and I think that's very strange where there's an image of her sitting on his lap as like a father figure or going to a basketball game and then an image later, many years later was holding her hand as a boyfriend, girlfriend at a basketball. I think that's really manipulative. Oh, 100 percent. But that's why I want to fight him. He's got it.

Speaker 2:          02:39:34       There's a great comedy album that are downloaded accidentally that I thought was a. I don't have that phone anymore, so I don't have it on me here, but there's a great comedy album that I downloaded that I thought was woody Allen doing stand up. Yeah, but it turned out to be woody Allen giving an interview about standup, so it was like woody Allen on Standup, I think it's called and it's really interesting man, because it sort of applies to stand up today, a lot of the ideas and the principles and leverage these talking about performers versus writers and what's good and what's not good. And it was really interesting man. He was good man. When I first started doing standup, somebody had like an open mic at the coconut

Speaker 4:          02:40:14       teaser, handed me a tape. I had one side was bill Hicks dangerous and the other side with some woody Allen Stanhope record and it was a pretty good fucking tape that somebody handed him. Yeah. Yeah. It was not bad, man. I think this one, this one audio thing, woody Allen on standup a, this one audio thing really should be something that people should, uh, should play, like a comics should play and listen to it because just to get a historical perspective of what it was like to be kind of at the forefront. I mean, if you think about like you're talking about the early sixties. Yeah, no, it was before it was the, you know, the people talk about stand up in the seventies and was like when, when it got crystallized as what standup is today, but, but those guys in the sixties, like Woody Allen, he tells jokes, man, it's pretty similar to what happens now.

Speaker 4:          02:41:05       Go to woody Allen. Stand up 65 rare. It's on youtube. It's a. He was in England filming. What'd you go for? Kangaroo. Kangaroo may fight. There was movies that. Can we scratch that guy up? Man. There was. Oh, this is real. Is this real? It's like a movie about a guy for a movie that's definitely breaks the legs. Oh Jesus. This is a terrible movie. Kick him in the chest. There was a lot of kangaroo boxing movies, I feel like. Came out in the eighties. Was big in the eighties that Cain rose mean you just can't reason with the kangaroo. Terrible, terrible fucking screen. If that gets kicked off Youtube, I'm going to be so pissed at you. What's the video be like? Oh, a woody allen. Stand up. Sixty five rare. It's a more subtle form of comedy. This woody Allen, but it'll do. It's really good though. It's really good to see like what comedy was in 1965, you know, to see like this guy who is known more of like as a film maker and play it a little bit

Speaker 6:          02:42:16       and when I was younger I used to hang out a lot the museum in search of a meaningful social relationships. So I used to look for girls. We played this before the world was a new group, but our real succulent nude, naked huntress stabbing to death, a warthog and I got very emotionally involved with the painting, you know, to God had to restrain me, write the lyrics over the oil, off the camera.

Speaker 4:          02:42:53       It's one of those things where like when you know his history now it's kind of weird. Washington talk about sex and perversion and giving into indulgence and idea. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, he seems obsessed with sex. But yeah. It's also interesting though to see like just how physically was. Yeah, it's not over the top, but he's doing like

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       his tricks that he's obviously learned to make people pay attention. Yeah. He's moving around a lot. That's a good way to put. Yeah, dance moves because some dance moves and he used to do like cafe wha and that he used to do like those folk scene. Mike's really? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They'd be like, what does cafe wall. It's like we're a Hendrix and dylan and everybody played in the village. Really share the stage. Joan rivers was there. Bob Dylan was there. It was nuts, man. It was this one venue where like people tried out more artistic things. Wow. Yeah. That's got to be really bizarre, man. And do standup. The intermixed with all these other. Yeah, because yeah, standup wasn't. I don't think there used to be shows where you go see a whole standup show back in the day. It was just part of the show.

Speaker 2:          02:43:59       That's why in Annie Hall, Woody Allen Goes, well, I don't want to go on after a comedian. You know why you have to be going on after comedian. Like that wasn't done back in the day. It was more of a variety show thing. Magicians jugglers, hat tricks and yeah, in musicians and makes you realize like how young stand up comedy really is all our, all our forms of human expression. Think about like films, films only been around for 100 or so years, you know, books, books, literature has only been around for 100 years or something like that to people and writing things down. I mean there's obviously written language from way, way, way back in the day, like the cuneiform tablets and shit for like 6,000 years ago. But like how long has it been where people have like acknowledged that with their writing is bullshit. Like this is fiction.

Speaker 2:          02:44:45       I'm making this up. I want you to like I'm telling you a story that I totally made up. How long has that been? Not that long, right? Not Long. I don't know. Obviously long time for like human life. Sure. But not that long in terms of perspective of the age of the human being or the age of the earth. So all this is like super new, super new, and one of the newest is standup and one of the newest of the newest is mediums. Yeah. Like jokes and form jokes in meme form or less than a decade old, right. Cosby mean. Yeah. Right. Like you just saw the bill cosby thing, right? Uh, the, the story. Yeah. The bill cosby meme. No, I haven't seen it. Oh, you don't know what happened? No. One of the greatest moments in internet history happened. Bill cosby. Okay. Yeah. A little story about bill cosby and accused of sexual assault and rape and all this jazz.

Speaker 2:          02:45:34       He put a meme generator on his own website that said, go ahead, meme me. And the first picture is him saying happy Monday, you know, like this. And then just, it was a rape fest, like everything was raped this and brophy's that and you know, Jello pudding and roof fees and gel putting in rape and fucking crazy idea. They examples were my favorite because they're like, look, you could make memes like this, like, hey, nice hat. And it just seems like a bill cosby holding his hat when you see like the ones that the people made was like, Hey, this is your dad or your mom, or something like that. It went from zero to rape in about eight seconds. Well, what's interesting is there's the conspiracy is that anybody who's smart enough to construct a website is going to be like in tune with the Internet.

Speaker 2:          02:46:22       Yeah. Anybody who's working for him and he's making websites, that fucking person. I don't want to throw this person under the bus, but that person has to know what the fuck is going to happen. Very attuned to the Internet. You put a meme generator up after the Hannibal burress video comes out and after all these people are talking about it, you got to know that they're going to meet him some awful shit. Yeah. This is the Internet. People do all kinds of vicious things. Spatially. Anything's too funny and vicious at the same. Especially when they get the green light. Oh yeah. If you're a drugging rapist, all bets are off, right? Yeah. But it's Cosby cosby. It's crazy. Yeah. This is a weird almost epilogue. I don't want to say his career's over, but it's a weird, he said such a long career. This is a weird thing to be happening at the last minute.

Speaker 2:          02:47:11       It's not just the last minute. It was clear the last minute of his life. Yeah. And if it was only like dementia and he was doing things recently and you get attributed to like, well there's something wrong with them, but then these people coming out with the stories that he's been doing this since the seventies. Yeah. And as late as 2004. So after the cosby show. Damn Damn. What is it, man? That goes on in a person's brain that makes them completely disconnect from humanity that makes them just be able to. Fame can get you their candidate fame and money. Can you think that's it? That's all it takes. No. Drugging women and raping them. No, but I think it can help you feel like you're above the law or you're entitled. Yeah, I think it can, but I don't know for sure. Rich privilege. Yeah. Black privilege. Now I can't say that Black Gypsy privilege. No, you can't say that. Can't say any of those things you just said.

Speaker 2:          02:48:07       Giving famous. Kind of make you go a little crazy. Too famous too. Definitely can make you go crazy and famous can definitely make you think you're different from other people. Especially if you get fame when you're young. I think when you live like all throughout your puberty and adulthood, you're, you're, everywhere you go. People Kissing your ass. Your idea of how you interact with people is you will literally think of yourself as being like royalty or something. Right? Can't there be a lot of suppressed anger with someone like bill cosby too. I mean he, he had to um, be a very like, friendly black entertainer for like a lot of white audiences even though probably a lot of the venues he was playing, they wouldn't even let him go in the dressing room and shit. Like there could be a lot of suppressed anger from someone that had to go through something like that. That's possible. But I mean, since the 19 eighties, yeah, yeah. It's like you've got to feel like that's a long time to harbor a grudge. Yeah. But 34, 35 years of like undeniable success. Yeah. I mean, how many years has he been super successful for?

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       Oh, I'd say since at least the seventies. Probably the sixties and all throughout the eighties. When I was a kid, we played that Noah's ark thing like Noah and talking to God. We played that when I was a little kid. Yeah. You know Noah, what God right. That was. That was a great bit. That was a great bit and we played that on a record. You're like a fucking album. We'd sit there with the headphones on and listen to that. Yeah. That guy just doesn't seem right that that guy was the rapist. That's like the sweaters alone are enough to make you think that's not a rapist. You know? One thing that kind of leads me in that direction besides all the obvious, is that he always into like people being clean and always into like yelling at comics for using dirty word pressing. Do you remember like the whole Eddie Murphy thing? Yeah. I called up, Richard just said I have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up. You know. Did, did the audience laugh? Did you get paid to have a coconut smile and shut the fuck up? You mean that was Richard Pryor given Eddie Murphy advice in which apparently was a real conversation. The next time he calls, tell him I said, suck

Speaker 1:          02:50:31       you gotta think like if a comic called you, you know, like say if like Jerry Seinfeld called you up and said, listen, you're very funny. Yeah. All you're doing is wrong. You know, you're always seeing you out there on stage and talking about your Dick. Right. Stopped doing it. You're making white America look bad. Right? Can you imagine if someone came up to you and was like, I can't imagine. And I think, I think Eddie was like kind of confused now that you're doing this to me. He was like, his, is he right? I don't know if he's right or not. Let me call Richard Skinner you to stop swearing. Mediamath Eddie Murphy back then was um, so far like during delirious when he would go on stage with that fucking leather suit on and shit. And Oh my God, so funny man. He was like the original arena comic, you know, he was doing back then and to get a call from bill cosby telling you to stop being dirty.

Speaker 1:          02:51:28       I think there's a little jealousy in there and I think there's a little bit of, oh, things are changing. I better try to slow them down part. Or he had this idea in his head that was just immobile. She's like, dirty is bad and eat. There's so many people that still think that like that's an easy way out or something. It's like, it's like saying rock and rock and roll music is not, it's not the way to go in all the drums and heavy bass and classical music is where it's at now. Classical music, classical music, dirty comedy is comedy. So it's like there's this kind of comedy and those, that kind of comedy. This is comedy that's clean but fucking hilarious. Like Hedberg, Mitch Hedberg, squeaky clean. Almost all of his jokes were clean, still unbelievably fucking hilarious. So funny. And then there's Joey Diaz who's never done a clean set ever in his life and he makes me laugh harder than any person that's ever walked the face of the world. I know. It's just comedy, man. Yeah. So if a guy like bill crosby calls you up, fucks with you like that. Yeah. I don't know. Meanwhile it was a chick tied to his bed and he's talking to Eddie Murphy. You hear in the background mark, good to you later. Deb. Barb it up. Jello pudding. Well, didn't he? By the little rascals. He bought the little rascals and stopped it from ever being distributed because it was so racist.

Speaker 4:          02:52:59       That's cool. Didn't Michael Jackson do something like that? Also wasn't little rascals, but Michael Jackson did something very similar where he bought good times, right? Was it good times? No, I don't think so.

Speaker 1:          02:53:10       I think you're thinking of the Beatles. He bought the Beatles music, the Beatles music. You're just butchering history and then you put it in a nike commercial. Do you remember that? Okay. Snipes. It might be a snopes, rather it says it might not be true. It's false. Oh, okay. The bill cosby bought the rights, the little, the little rascals or our gang comedies or to keep them off television because they depict racial stereotypes, false spanky, Alfalfa, buckwheat, Darla, just a few of the easily recognizable names that were found were fond part of the childhoods of generations of kids. What the fuck? Why aren't they on TV? In 1989, the began circulating the entertainer. Bill cosby had bought up the rights a little rascals, bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla. Nothing to do with it. Of course, king world productions has owned and licensed the rights to little rascals for over 30 years. This series has been syndicated television many times in the video rights to some episodes were licensed to cabin fever entertainment. Nineteen 97. So bill cosby has never owned any part of the right to little rascals. Yeah. So who the fuck owns that shit? Cosby was one of the prominent names who campaign to pressure CBS, do withdrawing Amos and andy from syndication back in the 19 sixties. My mom loved that show. Amos and Andy, did she, uh, did she yell racial?

Speaker 4:          02:54:31       No, no, there was, there wasn't a lot of racism in the house, but to facts name the cat, sambo and uh, said she liked Amos and Andy and even used to do the voice. Where'd you grow up? And I, I grew up in southern Maryland but she's from New Jersey and that was like, I swear to God, these things I'm bringing it up, make it sound crazy. But these are like two isolated incidences that never really added up to much. But I remember them because there was so weird and out of place in my household. What made you become a comic? What went wrong? Uh, I dunno, I just, whenever I was school I always had smart shit to say. Just popped into my head and I had to say it like smart. I wanted the attention, yes. Smart as shit. And I liked the attention and it seemed like the easiest way to get attention and it seemed like something that was good at. And listen, I had an instinct not to be a part of the group for some reason. I don't know why, but it wasn't about my mom like Amos and Andy. I don't think you're funny motherfucker, man.
