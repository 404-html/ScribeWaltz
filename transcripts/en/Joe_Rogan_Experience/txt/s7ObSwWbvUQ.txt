Speaker 1:          00:00:06       The job, real good experience.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Well all day we don't know what everyone's panicky wet. What do I do? I'm suddenly faced with adversity and my botox is running out so my head is actually able to squint.

Speaker 1:          00:00:33       Just order an uber. Before the rain hits you, you'll be okay. Then you just watched somebody else freak out and you think about it like he starts thinking that. How much has this guy been screened? You know, was it, was I supposed to be getting picked up by a lyft driver and the uber driver intercepted the signal or did. Did Uber know about all that shit? We're uber employees were calling apparently. There's like one guy was doing it like one guy was like pushing it. They were calling like Uber Rides or Uber was calling lyft rides and then like just canceling the Gig really fucking up. Their bitch is fucking up their business prank calls, like fake fake orders for cars and shit. Like. Which is really. I mean I know it's not. The whole company does not want to use a company when you hear shit like

Speaker 3:          00:01:19       maybe that's what it takes this. Somebody took the Glen Gary, Glen Ross

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       first scene to heart. Just doing that at every level of Uber. Yeah. You want coffee, you got to be a fucking closer coffee's for closers. I, I just wish, you know, I mean it seems like Uber was doing so well like it. I just wished there would be a company like that that would turn out to be super cool. You know? I always wished that about every company that I like, you know, like Oh, wouldn't it be nice if they're super cool?

Speaker 3:          00:01:45       Yeah. Like secretly all of Walmart's money was going to some kind of charity instead of just.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Walmart is always going to be a problem and I don't mean that in a good way or a bad way. It means just like whenever you have a big giant thing, you have a problem on both sides. You know, like one problem is people go, well, you know, Walmart comes into town and it kills all the small businesses and are we really? That grows that like saving a dollar here and five cents there is worth us going to some giant box where some people are in it that we don't know or are we going to go to our local place where we have like a relationship with the people that own it. It's like this small connection, like you're directly connected to these people's lives.

Speaker 3:          00:02:25       I think the issue at least where I fuck up as a consumer is you drive by and let's say you need a new tire for your car and you know you don't really care about your car that much. It's like a Corolla or whatever that has the cheapest tires in town. So like ideologically I don't really care who my tire replacement person is or their wellbeing or their quality of life. I just want the cheapest tire. See I don't. I get that. And then like it spills over into other areas of your life where you're like, well I want healthy groceries, but what if Walmart can give me the cheapest fucking lettuce? Then maybe I just don't care. I send a lot of people. I think eventually just buy everything that way.

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       Right? Yeah. Well it can definitely go that way. I mean if you're a smart consumer, if that's all you're worried about and you're just worried about numbers, but I think that there's companies that you just don't have a relationship with. You don't feel bad about that. Like, well, I don't have a relationship with whole foods. I don't know them. You know, I go there. The folks are all nice that worked there, but I know they're just working there. You know the guys where you get the Kale Salad from. Super Cool. Say Hi to say hi to the butcher Chit Chat with the people at the cash register. Like, yeah, everybody's friendly. But I know that their employees, you know what I'm saying? Like I don't feel connected to giving them my money, but like this restaurant that I go to all the time and the folks that own it, they've owned it for like 30 years and they're just the nicest, friendliest people. They're just really cool to talk to. Like every time I talked to them, like the guys from Greece and he's always telling me about like the difference between the way people behave there and behave here and just I get into these cool conversations with him. He's a very bright well read guy and just an interesting guy. So I love going there and giving them my money. But if I go to like applebee's, I don't fucking know anybody.

Speaker 3:          00:04:04       Yeah. The 16 year old hostess, she's not going to be there next week. It'll be somebody else.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       Yeah, I mean I'll be friendly to them for sure. You know, it's nice if you get the same waitress again. Oh Hey. How you doing was no culture there though, corporation. Well that's, that's what we, we miss in like losing those little small businesses, you know. But the first small business owner, man, it's a fucking grind. It's hard to do. I mean you have to, you have to really be selling something somebody wants. Like there's a, there's a fucking starbucks down the street here and next to the starbucks there's a shoe dealer, like a not a shoe dealer shoe repairman. I'm like, dude, like how many fucking people are getting their shoes repaired? I mean, is there some like death of a salesman type still out there need to get their shoes polished before an interview? I mean, I guess it's a, I guess if you have enough people in an area that is going to be enough.

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       People wear heels or falling off and I mean maybe I'm naive, but every time I go by that place there's fucking nobody in it. I'm like, who the hell's kitchen? Their shoes fixed. I would dress up like Jay gatsby one day and just go in there and pull up in that big yellow convertible that he had. Then Leonardo Dicaprio had. I was super torn on that movie. I was torn on it in two ways. One, it was like so surreal. Everything was so crazy. Like the way it was filmed, it was so obvious like you were watching a dream or something, you know? It was the special effects. Like when they were at the party and the glitter was flying and everybody's dancing. It's so over the top. The way he was driving over the top. It was almost hard to accept it as like a real story, like watching a story about real humans.

Speaker 3:          00:05:39       I think that goes back to the book itself. Like I remember liking it a lot in high school and college and thinking like this is what life was like back in the day in New York. And then you get older and you're like, that's not life at all. That's just some frivolous bullshit that somebody thought up. It was like a, you know, romance, a romance narrative

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       within the 19 twenties. It has no application of modern life at all. It's just a fucking fantasy. What's a sad ending with phantom? Well, there is something, I'm sure much more than there is now to someone who has a completely fabricated existence. There's something we all think is amazing about that. Like someone who could just fabricate their life and like how long can they pull it off? Like it's a great plot engine, which he's good at. Dicaprio is like the master of being the uh, was that a movie he was in? Where use the con artists kind of Wolf of Wall Street or the wolf of Wall Street. And then I'm thinking of um, catch me if you can. Oh, you, that's right. And then really remember that one. He's a bad motherfucker. I mean he doesn't get as much credit because he's beautiful and he's a, you know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       He's beautiful and he's kind of a pussy. That's always the case for us. Yeah, well him especially I'm in, I think he's one of the greatest actors ever. But like, he's such a beautiful man and he's silly. He's obviously so privileged. People look at him like this fucking guy. He's. Yeah, he's pretty good actor. Listen, if that guy was ugly, he would be saluted. He would be mean. Forget what Steve Buschemi gets kind of loves DBA. Shimmy gets here. We'll get that times a thousand. If he was ugly, if he looked like Steve Buschemi, God damn capital with the toast of the town, he needs a couple scars. No, he's too pretty. Even if he gets a couple of scars, people like good. You know, they, like, he's lived his life, a beautiful, wealthy, super talented actor. That's too much for some people, you know, I know people who don't take them seriously.

Speaker 1:          00:07:33       Like I've had conversations with, you know, quote unquote actor folks who are really brutal, really brutal. I was watched, watched at the beginning of move of a movie, a really good movie with this, uh, this friend of mine and uh, this actor walks by and goes a man. His career really fell off after this movie talking about. It was Jurassic Park, the, the first one. And uh, there's the dude who, uh, he was in event horizon, Sam Neill, Sam Neill. Exactly. The dude's like, hey, his career really fell off after this movie. Like, shut the fuck up and just watch the movie. Jesus Christ does it have to be about that. But they even real actory actor times just like praise performances, you know, you know, oh my God. Jeff Goldbloom was amazing in that film. He's quirky looking at enough. He allow them to be amazing in a film. But Leonardo Dicaprio, Goddamn beautiful man. Perfect bone structure.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       Just as handsome as fuck. Beautiful Hair, the perfect Ville and Django. Oh well that's why you get to see his range. How good he really is. Weight when he flips a switch and goes evil towards the end of the movie, you know like Yo, like you buy it. Like he's not like there's certain dudes who scream and yell and a movie and it almost ruins the movie because it makes me want to smack them. Like if somebody was screaming and yelling at you that you know, you fake fuck this, you're not even angry. Look at Shit is this, I'm going to smack you. But when he's screaming and yelling in that movie, you're like, oh, we're at def con nine here. We're about to get nuclear. Like Shit. Someone's going to get shot. Like this is like a death run. Like there's this something horrible. Is gonna happen at the end of this conversation? Like you got that from in the wolf, the wolf of Wall Street to and it's gacked out of his mind. Yeah. There's like a. like he really believed that he could go off the rails and fucking set off a suitcase nuke or something stupid. You know, he's gone

Speaker 1:          00:09:30       but too beautiful. Too beautiful for Hollywood. Sure. Definitely Django. They made him look fucked up his teeth. Yeah, they did a good job. That's what people looked like back then. They didn't have fucking caps. Yeah. And they uh, smoke from a pipe all day. This, I know a dude who got, um, he got, I guess their veneers. He got teeth put on over his teeth. Yeah. They just. Jamie's fucking yell at his teeth. Yes ma'am. Nobody had pretty teeth back then, man. But he turned psycho towards the end. Right? Let's see here. Um, was I saying, oh, I know this dude. You know, they have those veneer things and they make it look like you're wearing a mouthpiece. Look at, make sure lipstick out more. This guy is fucking lip. Stick out more now it's like, he's like, he's wearing a very thin mouthpiece. What if he doesn't wear it? It's just yellow teeth. He can't not wear it. Chip away your teeth. They chip away the surface of your teeth and they put this new surface. All of your permanent. Okay. Yeah, and it's like a veneer. It's like a like this would if you took a really thin slice of this wood and put it over some plastic bullshit and pretended it was oak. So that's what they're doing. They have this perfect white ceramic thing. I guess it's like a ceramic or some may be. It may be something like

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       some plastic veneer. Yeah, but what like what is it made out of though? It's like billiard ball type shit. Phenolic hookup. How you talk. You get it done. Well this guy did this guys are too big. I mean I don't know what's going on. I mean if he just decided to get bigger teeth or something like that. But I'm looking at him talking and it's like he's wearing like a little bit of a mouthpiece. I've been honest. This weird kick lately where I'm fascinated by people altering their image like radically. I got onto with Renee Zellweger, like I saw that renee, Renee Zellweger thing. That is like the textbook case of somebody. Yeah. Then is and Jennifer Gray? No, not chatter for Greg. Is that her from dirty dancing? What was her name? Is that right? Jennifer Gray. She was really pretty, but she had a big nose. Then she got her nose fixed.

Speaker 1:          00:11:38       I now, I'm not sure if it works. Is it Jennifer Gray? Yeah, she was really pretty, but she, you know, she had a Jewish looking knows that European hump thing going on, which is just character, you know, for sure. Whatever. Right. Plus it disappears if you're looking dead at anything. Yeah. Well she was cute and then she became, I guess, you know, she likes it better, but it's, she's a different person, that's for sure. So anyway, I got on this kick lately where I started looking at all these, uh, different procedures that people have done and uh, I watched a nose job yesterday. Somebody sent me a nose job on twitter of this, uh, this woman getting her nose fixed. I tweeted it. You can see it on my twitter page, but it's a long video of the entire process. It's sped up a bit, but holy shit, is it brutal?

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       Like the nose, well, you know, I had my nose cleaned out like I had my nose, a deviated septum repair to has smashed Septum and it was blocking off most of my ability to breathe out of my nostrils, but this, this is, this was way more involved because they had to actually chip away her bone. They peeled her nose back like a banana and then chipped away the bone to make the nose smaller and then put it all together again. Isn't it amazing the lengths people go to to do something that nobody cares about any way? Well, some people do care though. See, that's the thing. You know, you can't say that. Some people don't look better once you fix their fucked up nose because. Well, Renee Zellweger, nobody would have cared if she had just aged and looked somewhat like she used to look. Not that you don't have the right to change your appearance, but it was just that that sudden shock.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       That kind of surprised people. Well, imagine this. Okay, you, you're a young man and you make your living off of your mind. Okay? You make your living off of your commentary, your ability to notice things, podcasting, things along those lines. I'm much older than you. I'm 47 years old, but my brain doesn't work any differently than when I was young. My body is slowly but surely starting to work less good. Like I get injured more easily. Like I still work out pretty hard, but when I get injured like I fucked my elbow up a couple months ago in this bitch just won't get better. You know what I mean? So those kinds of things. But I'm not a professional athlete. If I was, I would be freaking out. If I was, I'd be freaking out if I was a professional talker, if my brain started to slowly slow down and my brain started not able to form sentences or not being able to recognize and objective behavior problems or you know, confusion of what the topic is I'm discussing.

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       If those types of things started happening on a regular basis and someone came along and said, hey, we can give you this drug. You know, it's gonna make you 70 percent better. Yeah. It's like, you know, you're getting old, we're going to shoot your forehead up with botulism and it's going to freeze the whole thing so you can't, you can't look frown and then it'll relax. It will make you look a little better. You're like, okay, okay. And then everybody's like, what's wrong with your fucking. But to her, she's like my forehead's lynee anymore. Yeah. The acting career has been extended maybe, but maybe people are just going to get weirded out by you, you know? Did you see that Dutchess who's worth like some an godly amount of money, but she's had like insane amounts of plastic surgery and she's just taken ill just pull.

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       If you buy better view, pull up Dutchess plastic surgery disaster you see here. But this poor lady, when she was young, she was very pretty and obviously that meant a lot to her. If there was a big part of who she was, not just a part of who she was, but like most of her world probably for a lot of beautiful women. It's like you're, you're born with the greatest lottery ticket ever. Like everywhere you go, people are just tripping over themselves to get to you, to be nice to you, to get close to you, to give you things, and it's really just because of the dimensions of your face and your body. It's incredible and you have to be quite a piece of shit to fuck that up. Like to like to get it so that men don't want to talk to you. Even though you're perfectly designed, you have to be like really annoying, you know, you have to be like really mean are really selfish or were guys like, I don't care how hot she is out of here, you know, most, there's almost always going to be a suitor.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       That's a good picture of her by the way. And I'm not kidding. There's a before and after of her. That's really quite brutal. Yeah. That's what she used to look like. But that's like as she was getting older, that was before she really hit it hard. I'll just go ahead and find it. But um, where was, I was on a part of the money but she's unhappy. So we were talking about good looks about how like how valuable that is. It's a massive thing. So imagine if you're a woman and your entire self worth is derived off your looks, which is possible. It sounds sad. People are like, well, what do we put it? Sexist fucking things that say men. Women don't think like that. But listen, let's be realistic. Men think like that. There's some men that think like that. There she is. There's some men that think like that and there's some good.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       Yeah, there's some people that are fucking beautiful and those people, they do have that Willy Wonka golden ticket and a lot of times it's just being born that way just to roll the dice. So if you got that lottery ticket and you're watching it slip away for some people, that's a very, very, very tough pill to swallow. They gotta read some Alan Watts slipping away for everybody and we're all kind of a continuous thing. Yeah. But then they see these young girls is 20 year old girl laughing and giggling like cube bitch, just angry, you know? Do you think there's more envy between women and there is between men because guys don't have a lot of. We don't have like generational envy adult really. Um, I don't know, but this is what I definitely think. I definitely think there's zero value in wondering who's got it worse.

Speaker 1:          00:17:40       Men Or women, you know? Who Do you think it's worse for a man to feel jealous or a woman to feel Joe's? Um, I think it's definitely not worrying. Worth worrying about. Got It. Worse in that situation. Like the men. I think the men woman thing is way safer to be a guy in some respects. You know, you don't have to worry about women, but you still have to worry about men. But other than that, there's benefits to both sides. Clearly, you know, it's, it's really entirely who you are and how you look at it. There's women who you talked to them. The last thing they would ever want to do is be a fucking man. Like, are you kidding? You guys are morons. I'm going to be one of these apes just running around trying to stick my tube steak into people. And shoot Goo all the time and I'm lying to them constantly to try to get to that position pulleys and blind and myself about who I am to appeal more sexually attractive.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       You see New Jersey is considering a bill that would make it or it would make it. It would make it sexual assault. Yeah. Form of sexual assault to lie about how much money you make, which is really interesting, but not just lie about money lie about anything. Oh, okay. Yeah. The idea is that using deception in order to get sex, that you're a liar and you've, you frauded someone. But man. Okay. So then if that's the case, then we're, we're putting, we're making sex like a value. Well we're, we're making sex. Like by saying that you're, you're essentially condoning a form of prostitution because if that's the case then is it a felony or whatever the fuck type of charge they're calling it. What kind of charge are they calling it? What fence? Whatever level of fences. Why is it not a felony or a crime of a similar order?

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       If I decide to lie to you to become your friend and make you give me a massage. No. Right, no. Then it's not because then you know you weren't sexually assaulted. It's like the idea of sex and the idea. This person was absolutely willing to have sex with that person, but only because that person didn't exactly tell the truth. Well, if you're, if you get like friends with someone and have them stay over your house and here, here man, borrow my car because you think the guy has a lot of money. It turns out he's totally fucking broke and a con artists. Is that a felony? I bet it's not. I bet if he goes to court and your honor, the guy let me borrow his car. Did you? Mr Siemen let him borrow your car. I thought he was the Duke of fucking Duchess of whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:20:09       You know? Yeah. Let him borrow my car. Well, you should have checked on that case to semest. Yeah, but if you get fucked, if you let that guy fuck your face, then people are going to go, hey, you got rapes on you guys. You got the bad end of the stick for sure. The shorter end of the stick a maybe not. I mean look, people shouldn't lie, but I don't know if you can make laws like that, so it's such a slippery slope because if a guy is dressed well, a night club on a Saturday night and he's got a nice watch on, is he not misrepresenting himself? Is that sexual assault? If he takes the girl back? Yeah know I guess he's supposed to dress in a fucking garbage man outfit because that's his income level or can you actually look good on a weekend and I'm kind of like playing a little thought experiment here, but just because that's, you know, that's a very valid point.

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       It does seem like a slippery slope, you know? Yeah. It's a very valid point. How about if someone with a fucking counterfeit watch on. Yeah, I mean that's a big thing with some guys. They buy fake watches up and down Canal Street rolodex rollback. They're all over the place. Yeah. And they're pretty good like some of the copies because now they have computers that can scan like it used to be when if you bought like a fake rolex, she had to hire someone to create the plans and have it. I can just three d print that shit. Probably like 99 point nine percent the same thing. It's really similar. I mean they can. The good ones actually take a rolex and they literally copy every piece of it. I don't know. Power efficient. It is. I don't. I mean half of them probably break. I mean who the fuck knows what kind of quality control they have.

Speaker 1:          00:21:44       But if you're looking at it, if you don't know any better, you like, that's a rolex. This guy's got money. That's like a $5,000 watch. Meanwhile no lives with. His mom bought the watch for 50 bucks. I bought it on craigslist with bitcoin. Is that guy, is he a fraud as he should he go to jail for that? How's that work? He's only a fraud to himself. I think that one of the big things about an expensive waste of money. Watch this, you can look down and be like, I earned this. So if you're looking down at something that like reasserts that you're full of Shit, then what do you like? What kind of energy are you putting out there? You know? Well that's the thing that I'd rather pay $100 for a watch. It's actually like a real fossil or real, you know, real time Max.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       Then a fake rolex, but a fake rolex. It looks exactly like a rolex and worked perfectly. The sound like a fake Ferrari, you know, you get a fake Ferrari on the highway, like this fucking thing's terrible. No, it's a watch. I mean, it doesn't do a lot. Just tells you what fucking time it is. Not only that, the reality is those mechanical watches, they're beautiful and everything like that. It's kind of cool. I like the idea behind it that like a craftsman takes this watch and constructs it and all the wheels and gears and everything are all sinked up. I think that's absolutely fascinating, but one of those fucking quartz watches works way better. Those courts power watches, those fucking things are never wrong. There they stay like their time stays perfect forever. I have expensive rolex that the UFC gave me a watch that I would buy, but it's a beautiful watch and that fucker's wrong. Like every two months I got to like back it up five minutes and I'm not exaggerating. It's like every two months it's five minutes fast. It's like, you know, thousands of dollars for this fucking thing. If you. It's old technology. It's actually a. it's kind of a fetish for, for rich men. Yeah. See, this is like this watch doesn't cost much and it glows in the dark and you can go under water with it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       It's never wrong. It doesn't. It doesn't get tired and then when it does, it's like a fucking two year lifespan

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       on the battery. You put a new battery in your good. Well not 30 years with the Apple Watch coming out. Anyone who doesn't have an apple watch is going to be by default, a hipster. So you'll be like, oh, okay. You're old fashioned. You have the vintage watch on. I don't buy that. I don't think so. Nope. Too problematic. It's a bunch of problems with the watch. First of all, no one wants to fucking be completely connected to your shit all the time like that. It's one thing about having a phone but constantly staring at your watch, like your Dick Tracy and getting text messages on your watch. That shit's stupid. Especially because you're. You have to have your phone as well. Like you already have your phone. Like what do you. Why do you, why you want to look at your watch and get the weather.

Speaker 4:          00:24:28       So on your fucking phone. It's right there. What do we do? You need it to be on everything. How about you put it across your Dick and like a big neon sign in your underwear. So when you peek and get the weather, this is stupid. Like we're getting ridiculous. Like how many more things do we need? I didn't. I didn't realize you needed to have the phone on you. If that's the case, it makes it a little less cool. Well, I'm sure you can use it without the phone, but it doesn't have cellular functionality it might have for the cellular function because I mean maybe it's just like an appendage for an iphone. We don't really need that. Well, I mean it's essentially a small little computer on its own. It carries mp3s. You can do a lot of things with it. It does work as a watch, you know, I'm sure if you load the weather and all that stuff up on it, it probably stays on, but I'm pretty sure it syncs up to your watch this last week.

Speaker 4:          00:25:12       This bracelet, this is a concept, but supposedly they show it working. I'll show you the video. This brace, this. They're showing two things here, but this bracelet as well I was talking about. This is a video playing out of a bracelet on your wrist and at the working iphone or screen touchscreen. Oh my God. And do it underwater. Wow. Whoa. See, we're getting too crazy. But it's also a concept to. They're asking for money. They said they needed like a million dollars to get it working. Somebody better check the tech on that. Maybe you had to pumping dump. I'm not invested in money in anything that's not already there looking cool. It's going to be just give us a million dollars. Yeah. I don't get that. People I'm going to get involved in the ground floor and no, don't do that. That's the case with, uh, with bitcoin and all coins really, like there are, aside from Bitcoin, there are thousands of other coins and they suck people in because it's one of those things where, um, uh, your mind goes, this could be the next bitcoin, but statistically it's not going to be, but it could be.

Speaker 4:          00:26:13       And so you put money into it and most of those things turned out to be bullshit. But there are a couple that are promising so. Well, it was funny talking to Andreas Antonopoulos yesterday who's a really fucking interesting dude. I'm glad we. I'm glad we have him on our side, the human race since, because he would be really dangerous in the hands of the military, industrial nsa type side of things. Yeah. Well, I'm sure they have guys like him that level of intelligence, but when he was talking about Bitcoin, one of the things that he was talking about was how

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       it's important to recognize that this is not something that you're going to do and get rich off of like you. If you're getting involved in this. You get involved in this because you believe in it and that's essentially what's going on right now. And he likes that. You know, it's like the, you know, the people that are investing all their money, it's very likely you're gonna lose your money, but on long run,

Speaker 3:          00:27:02       on the other hand it's also likely or not likely, it's possible you can make an astronomical amount because I'm Peter diamandis talks about this. There's a youtube lecture people can look up called exponential thinking and he's the guy who started the x prize foundation and I realized that part of it is probably just he wants to give really bad ass lectures, but I think that what he's saying is actually true. And that's that once you get any technology and make it completely digital, it has to follow Moore's law to some extent where you get that doubling of sophistication every year to 18 months and uh, if you kind of ignore the price itself that's been happening with Bitcoin, like the sophistication of it is roughly doubling every year in terms of services offered on top of it and things you can do with it. And if you follow that out to its logical extreme, um, it eventually has to be worth a lot more than it's worth now because nobody's really using it. You know, it's like a couple million people using it that's less than one percent, well, less than one percent of financial transactions. If you get up to maybe like five or 10 percent, which is totally reasonable, I think that number has to be much, much larger.

Speaker 5:          00:28:10       Yeah. For 10 percent sign out of the realm of possibility, especially when you consider they're starting to use it on paypal. I mean, as soon as you can use it on paypal, people are like, Ooh, that's pretty easy. If I could just go with bitcoin instead of dollars and you could start, you know, he set up a bitcoin account connected to your paper towels are buying things.

Speaker 3:          00:28:27       Well, the thing was some of the remaining critics and the media of Bitcoin were saying, you know, it's great technology, but it's not there yet because it's not ready for the masses. And increasingly that's no longer a valid argument because there are a few companies that have built stuff on top of Bitcoin, which is kind of what people had been saying would happen. Right? And these services are so mainstream friendly that you take one look at it and you're like, oh, I get it. Like the change tip thing. Uh, I had been doing stuff with them, like playing with their tipping thing. You, you've been getting a lot. I don't know if you've been ignoring them, but it's actually real money. People are sending you and somebody said, hey, great podcast. Here's a coffee. How do you know where it is? It goes on your twitter.

Speaker 3:          00:29:07       Uh, they, they're very smart about it. It integrates with your twitter account or your reddit account or google plus and it's like a just masses friendly I can say to you like, Hey, enjoy the video yesterday, here's a beer and it sends you like $3 worth of Bitcoin does all the shit on the back end. So all you need to know is what your twitter password is and you can collect your money. Yeah, but what if you don't have an account? As long as you have a twitter account, they'll like allow you to log in and collected. Oh, how bizarre. It's really well done. It's a cool idea to a bunch of those. Well I didn't know what they were saying. Just like ignored it. Yeah. No, those are

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       for real. They're not like phishing attempt. So those are strangers sending you money because they like your podcast, which right now is still probably, you know, a very small percentage of listeners. But what about when everybody has one of these things in their wallets and whenever they hear a podcast they like, they can just spontaneously send you fifty cents like that multiplied by a thousand people or 200,000 people. You can tell advertisers to get fucked within a couple of years. You know, that's true. But you run into the risk of running into people that. One of the things that I like about the fact that the podcast is free. So like when if people complain or if there's something they don't like or something they want different price was right. Yeah. Like let's do this is how I'm doing it. No, I don't want to hear it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       You should just try. Why don't you make it an hour? Why don't you just stop, listen, stop, stop. I'm doing what I'm doing. If you don't like it, that's cool. But if they're paying for it, then they'll, they'll be much more likely in that. It's not most people, but it's like selecting out the random problem people. It's like most people, you allow them to buy you a drink and everything's cool, you know? But there's that rare person, you know, I was in Vegas recently and this guy didn't even bias drink. I was sitting with my friend Justin, and it was after UFC we're just catching up, having a couple drinks, shooting the shit. There's this fucking guy and his wife and they were hammered next to us. They wouldn't leave us alone, they just wouldn't, just wouldn't stop. And the guy was just dumb. He kept interrupting with the questions and it was annoying everyone around them.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       And then finally the dude chimes in and I go, come on, man. I go, we're just trying to have a conversation. I mean, I, I can't keep talking to you about this, you know, you keep interrupting in the middle of everybody talking. He goes, hey man, I bought you a fucking drink that somebody who needs an express hit of lsd or something so they can see like just the little tiny picture of what an asshole they're being. And then when he was just an idiot, it was just really dumb. But he won. Meanwhile, he didn't buy me a drink. He did. And I go, no, you didn't. I go, first of all, I'm not drinking so you haven't bought me a drink, and my friend Justin paid the tab tab, the thing he was lording over you. He didn't even do, but in his mind he was like, he's probably bought drinks for people before, so he decided this is where I was fucking and I bought them at drank.

Speaker 1:          00:31:52       I bought you a god to me. He was just so drunk and dumb and just that those people are out there and so if those people are paying for your podcast, you know, if you're asking for donations, you know, please donate to my pay pal button and then you get these twitters. I was going to donate to like hurt your ignorant rant on Ferguson. Did sister line in the sand, David Seaman, Ferguson is where we separate the heroes from the zeroes that people are going to change this culture. There's a lot of people like super pumped up to start a revolution. They're walking into fucking traitor. Joe's clapping their hands saying you can't stop the revolution. Have you seen this? This fucking videos of these morons? And it's usually like

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       menopausal women, um, dudes with aimless, shiftless minds, you know, people that there's something wrong with them. They're out there walking through supermarkets yelling at people. People are just trying to, you can't stop the revolution. It's like, what revolution is this? The revolution that interrupts shopping with shitty singing,

Speaker 3:          00:32:58       the Revolution of affordable yogurt and fresh fruits, vintages,

Speaker 5:          00:33:02       doing nothing but making a lot of energy and sound by doing it. Like, I get that you're upset about police brutality. I get that you're upset about the way this country is going. I get the. But going through trader Joe's, clapping your hands is in fixing a fucking thing because just going to alienate people to whatever dumb idea you have.

Speaker 3:          00:33:23       Yeah. Uh, there was a woman in Venice beach who came up to me recently and asked me to sign our petition to run for president. She's going to run. Yeah, I know. I was Kinda like, well, don't you maybe you want to start with like a youtube channel or something. Like, who the fuck are you? You know, you can't just leap right to president. And she had a few signatures and she was so serious about it and I was like, well, what's the platform? And she's like, we're going to eliminate homelessness in Venice beach. And I was thinking like, that's not really a national platform, you know, you're going to become president and be like, we have to address the five homeless people right here. So, um, my point though is I think that people think that they have to change something and they have to do something because they can see all the problems around them. And for some people that's, let's go to a protest or let's, let's run for office or let's, you know, let's just start a petition. No matter how ridiculous it sounds. And the sad reality is, revolution is silent nowadays. Like the people who are online buying bitcoin and developing these other coins are creating more of a revolution than anybody in the trader Joe's on a Tuesday.

Speaker 5:          00:34:24       Well, I think what they're trying to do is raise awareness. I guess what, who the fuck isn't aware? But this ferguson ruling went down to this riots and Missouri who's unaware that you don't, you don't have to walk through Pasadena yelling at people. Like those people were aware.

Speaker 3:          00:34:39       Well I was tweeting out stuff about, um, I was like, why do black people distrust law enforcement so much? It's not just this one case like some of the people on Fox News or making it seem like this is happening in a vacuum and it's that black people are really discriminated against when you look at the percentages of, of drug charges and stuff, even after decriminalization occurs in states like Massachusetts, blacks continue to get arrested at disproportionately high rates. So you know, there's some kind of racism happening there.

Speaker 5:          00:35:08       Well, or you know, there's two things for sure. There's racism definitely. And definitely it makes it more difficult for cops. You know, if you are dealing with like say if you're a good cop and you know, you're dealing with a community that's been totally ostracized because there's been a bunch of cops that came before you that profile a black people that pick them out to harass them,

Speaker 3:          00:35:34       forcing a couple of laws that just shouldn't exist anymore. Like it's weird me that here in the great God fearing state of California, I can smoke weed and I consider it to be an antidepressant for me. And I do it legally. You know, I'm a law abiding citizen. I have the medical marijuana card. You just go a couple hours away and suddenly you're like cool hand Luke, uh, to get the same exact thing. Like now you're on the wrong side of the law and that's the case in half the country. Like we have this weird limbo thing. We're half the states, have it half don't. Oh, you mean just the marijuana? Yeah, just the marijuana. And like as like a white journalists, like I'm probably not going to be the one who's singled out. But if you're a dis, uh, um, like any kind of disadvantaged minority, your chances of being busted for something like that is way higher. And then the cost, just the cost to your, um, your career and everything, it can take years to get that off your record. So that's a real thing that is somewhat a happening along racial lines.

Speaker 5:          00:36:29       Yeah. I'm the fucking see about this. Uh, uh, that's a minor. I mean, that's a least like a physical thing that you can, you could say like, oh, it's a thing. It's marijuana. This is what, you know, they're getting arrested for. Did you hear about this fucking guy that uh, the cops stopped the man for walking with his hands in his pocket. No, it sounds like a guy in Michigan who was doing nothing wrong and they both pull out their cell phones and they film each other. So there's a two phones standoff between the cop and the guy and it's the most ridiculous shit ever. I mean, this fucking guy just has his hands in his pocket. That's it. It's just a black guy who happens to have his hands in his pockets and the cop starts questioning him and the guy pulls his phone out of the cop, pulls his phone out.

Speaker 5:          00:37:18       They're both recording each other at the same time. It's like, what are we doing? That guy's not doing anything wrong. Let him go. Let him go. He's not doing shit. Okay? He's walking with his hands in his pocket. He pulled out his phone. He's filming. You're filming him. You're wasting my fucking money and I'm going crazy seeing this, so please let that fucking guy walk. He's not committing any crimes, but walking was fucking hands in his pocket. Everybody, everywhere you look might be doing something that you can't see that's illegal. It doesn't mean you get to knock on everybody's fucking door and going, I didn't even see inside your house. What are you doing in there? You don't get to do that Douche bag and when a guy's walking down the street with his hands in his pockets, he might as well be alone in his home until you see something actually suspicious, like he's reaching into his hand, like he's pulling out a fucking gun out of his inside of his jacket. If you don't see that, then shut the fuck up because you just seen a guy walking and you're allowed to put your hands in your pocket to stay warm. Don't have to like walk everywhere with our hands up. Is that our new thing, David Seaman? We have to walk with her fingers moving. So we know that there's no razor blades in between them.

Speaker 3:          00:38:19       We most certainly do not. I think that, um, it's a real issue where I think that people, a lot of people or status in the same way that, um, the few hundred years ago people were really a blindly adherent to the church, said anything. Even if the church says something completely ridiculous, like the church said, Galileo is wrong. So we have to keep them under house arrest. And today the state, this similarly kind of opaque organization says Julian Assange is wrong. We have to keep him under house arrest in his thing and that embassy, it's Kinda the same thing, like you have somebody who's just the thought criminal saying things that you don't like, but there are actually some extent, completely fucking true, at least in the case of Galileo in the case of some of the surveillance stuff. Uh, so how, how, how different is it really? And you have people ruining lives over marijuana possession in a state like Missouri that's a little behind the times in that respect. And you go, well, what, what gives you this right to do that? You're just like an agent of the church ruining people's lives over accusations of witchcraft. It's similarly nonscientific, you know, there's no scientific basis for this stuff. There's no public safety basis.

Speaker 5:          00:39:29       Well, I think once, once the time has gone and passed and there's been enough space to reflect, people are going to look back of marijuana legalization. Very similar to the way they looked at like putting people in jail for being a witch.

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       Oh, for sure. I think every age, every age has some kind of evil that for whatever reason, the people living through it just don't really see how big a deal it is. And that one before was segregation and now I believe it to be, um, prohibition and not just of drugs, economic prohibition. Like why are these little companies playing with Bitcoin, concerned about the government going after them for money laundering and stuff. It's ridiculous, you know, like they're trying to play with these laws that were designed 40 years ago and the technologies are totally different now. Well,

Speaker 5:          00:40:12       one of the things that prohibition does similar to censorship, that's insidious. One of the more insidious aspects of it is not just that they, um, you know, you have a difference, a differing opinion as to what should, and should not be acceptable behavior, whether it's saying certain words or using certain drugs. But it becomes a thing where another person has control over you and it's preventing you from doing something that you want to do. And when people prevent people from doing things they want to do, it builds up resentment and it causes conflict. And it fucks up a lot of harmonious relationships. It's very difficult to deal with the idea of one person having ultimate power over you, especially for something like marijuana or, you know, saying certain words. If you go to court, okay, you're in court and you know, the guy passes some sort of a ruling on you and you're like, fuck you, your honor. That's bullshit. They can throw you in jail for longer because you said, fuck you, your honor. Just some guy. Contempt of court. Yeah. Some guy who by the way it's been proven there. Just people. All right. It's not like this is like a hood that the judges. Oh human, no, everyone's a fucking person. So you've just got people there and you so can't say fuck

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       you to that guy if he does something unbelievably wrong. And meanwhile has been proven in countless cases of judges being arrested for fraud. Judges being arrested for corruption, masturbating in robes, thing in Pennsylvania was pretty bad. He was sending all these kids to some kid corrections facility. The worst. He was getting paid. Yeah. He was getting paid to do that. And he's in jail now for like 35 years and that's not enough. That's like a dickens novel that's awful to treat kids like that and just taking kids away from their parents and having them locked up and he was profiting off of it. Deal where they would pay him that. That's a judge, that's the judge. It's a person that's this. It all comes back to the drug war and prohibition because uh, a lot of stuff is just too complicated. You can't say that it's purely good or evil and it's gray areas.

Speaker 4:          00:42:21       But as far as I'm concerned, the private prison industry, which is a real thing is as close to pure evil as you can get. You have people who are using all the tools of capitalism which are significant tools and they're using it not to, you know, build us a better phone next year or to cure some new kinds of cancer. They're using it to keep people in cages for exploring their own minds and a trafficking and things that are just natural herbs. I mean, that's, to me, it's close to evil as you can get. Well, it's a machine that

Speaker 5:          00:42:51       when have you, when you got a big business like that, whether you're a big business is Walmart or target, you know when, when they get in trouble for trying to change regulations and laws in order to allow them to make more money in certain ways, that might not be legal right now. People look at them like, oh, they're terrible. Oh, they're evil. They're just trying to stay alive. There are machine and the machine that generates money. When you get a million people involved in that machine and you, you, you essentially have a million pieces and these pieces run this organism, this organism call it target or call it a name. Any one of them. Once they become a machine there, they want to continue to extract money in any way they can. Once they have that process going, they want to continue and if it just means arresting more people and locking them up in their houses because the house make money every for every person in that house, you get x amount of dollars a year.

Speaker 5:          00:43:47       The more people you get, the more money we get. The more laws on the books and more people will get to the more laws that were on the books, the more money we'll will our, our organism will get. And every one of these corporations, every one of them, whether it's fucking, whether it's target or whether it's fill in the blank, you know, starbucks, they all want to grow every year. They want to grow, they want to get bigger and bigger and bigger. No one wants to taper off. Hey, we've been doing good for about 10 years guys. Um, my house is pretty much paid off. Like let's just taper off. I don't need more money. I don't need a boat. Come on man. If I had a boat out of a fixed the boat and cleaned the boat, fuck that. Nobody does that. So when you deal with a company like target or you deal with a company like a Bob's prisons or whatever the fuck is, it's the same thing. You're allowing someone to make money doing.

Speaker 3:          00:44:35       Well, I think, I think you nailed the heart of the issue, which is these institutions are there to extract money and if we can get a better form of money then even though we're still gonna, have people doing human things which involves making as much money as possible. If they're actually using more fair money, then we can track that flow and it can be done in a more fair way. Like I'm pretty convinced that a lot of the shit we see in terms of militarization and all the military industrial complex and whatnot, it's because of the way our financial system works, that we have the government to go back to comparing government to the church from a few hundred years ago. He had this organization that is beyond the average person's understanding and they're the ones in charge of money and it's very unscientific and it's kind of mysterious.

Speaker 3:          00:45:23       And it seems like that money always loops back around and goes to these kinds of organizations like, um, like, uh, companies that lobby for prison contracts and not to the individual. You know, there's, there's an intrinsic problem there. And, uh, based on what I've researched, I really think that this whole currency revolution is going to fix a lot of that so we're still going to have shitty problems, but it's going to be a lot harder in 10 years to be a Booz Allen Hamilton or a, a Lockheed Martin or whatever, and do the creepy stuff. You'll still be able to do the good stuff, but the creepier sides are going to be just really hard to justify because that money is going to have to come from somewhere. Like in the same way that those tipping services are taking off a. every citizen is going to have some say over where their money actually goes. And that sounds like it's very futuristic still. But it's going to happen I think faster than people realize because it's happening. You know?

Speaker 5:          00:46:17       Well, if that's the case, it's going to be a weird world to see companies, corporations become accountable and started having to address and adjust. And if you force them to be accountable, they're essentially comprised at people. If the people at the top end of the spectrum or not just being forced to act ethically but are encouraged to and are empowered by doing so, like they get to feel good about the fact that look, everybody can make a living and not raped the world. It is possible. I mean just the idea that capitalism has to be this monster that doesn't give a fuck about anything but money. That's only because we've allowed it to be that we haven't liked strained it, constrained it with ethics and morals and essentially that's the case with human beings. Psychopaths come from. When you think murderers and fucking warlords come from. I don't think it's a human being, but hold on. That's a human being that hasn't been constrained, right? I mean that's what it is. It's a human being that hasn't been like, hey, you need to develop along the way a series a, a set of ethics, morals. We become a good person or you could become a good company as well, or you can kind of bribed your way through the maze to get to the top and be

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       this fucking evil whoremonger murderer, cat. And that's possible too. And that we've seen both. Yeah. I think just that you say with ethics and morals, that's important, but there's no way to screen for that. You know. So I think what's really going to help us out is just promoting better forms of technology. Like we can. We can give every new cop, you know, the full star Trek Federation lesson and you know, don't you know the, the prime directive don't do harm to others. We can give them the whole download in terms of morality. They might skip that lesson, they might not actually get that, but if they have a body camera on them at all hours, they're on duty. It doesn't really matter because we're going to have some accountability and that's due to technology. And I think with this bitcoin stuff, it's the same way, like you're still going to have shitty governments and shitty people and greedy corporations, but now somebody can actually track all of it and we can watch it happening in real time.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       And that right there, you know, even if I didn't own any that right there is enough of an upgrade that I'd be willing to fight for it because what we have right now is fucking chaos and it's not working for anybody. It's going to be really interesting to see if something like Bitcoin or ultimately whatever coin it is, if it does become big enough that it has a significant impact on the world. Because as soon as that does happen, if the, if the balance starts to sway in that direction and people start hopping on that and then that becomes the way people start exchanging goods and purchasing things. It could really be a monumental shift in human culture. I mean really be like the first time ever people have a full say. And if people really do get to that state where we no longer need a bank, I mean that's just what a giant chunk of the economy would be eliminated with a giant chunk of the people that control massive amounts of resources and money.

Speaker 4:          00:49:22       There would be just shit out of luck. There's a whole class of people in New York that are basically professional money, men and many women and they will go away and they will be the most unmissed class of people in human history. Notoriously ruthless. Yeah. No, totally selfish. Took money from taxpayers and then turned around and still foreclosed on all these millions of people. And it's not all of them. I mean, some of them are great. I'm sure that the financial system that is, it's like if you work in a slaughterhouse, you might be the best butcher there. You're still in a house, you know? And that's, that's the system they work in. And this, what makes bitcoin so different is that it wasn't designed to make money off of people. You know? I guess we can't tell what his intentions were, but the way it works, it doesn't need to make a lot of money off of you to send money. It's not like a fee based thing. What doesn't make sense about how much money bankers make? What are you doing? You just move money around. You get so much of it that you get to buy a castle. Oh, they buy ads on TV convincing you to sign up for a 401k and then they make their money on the management fee. How much do you think

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       they're given Samuel Jackson to do those goddamn capital one commercials? Maybe they paid off his credit cards a few times, but Samuel Jackson is a wealthy man. I mean, he's a huge actor. He said one of the biggest actors in Hollywood, still to this day, how can they pay him to do that? I don't know if they gave him a price. That's right. It's probably not that much time in front of a green screen, but there's a lot of actors that are starting to do those. They're doing capital one commercials. They're doing like Alec, Alec Baldwin. Yeah. That's weird. Seems to. It seems odd. It seems odd bullets because banks are mostly psychological so they have to keep raising the bar to keep our attention. Yeah. But why would the movie stars be interested in doing that? I mean these are wealthy people. That's what's confusing to me.

Speaker 1:          00:51:07       You should get them in here and I don't want to. You don't want. It's okay. No, you think it's probably just easy access to money I guess. I mean I guess it's just a shit ton of money to do a little work, but it seems like how much money they have. I mean you're talking about are really wealthy people, it seems like, especially with Samuel Jackson. So what is he like 65 or something like that at a certain point in time and already a legend. I mean you can't, no matter what happens after pulp fiction, he's a great actor forever. You know, you have a lot of actors. They fuck it up towards the end. There's a lot of actors, like towards the end they start sort of, it all kind of fades off, you know, and they start doing like those Robert De Niro movies that he's been doing lately.

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       You know, Robert Deniro was doing fucking God damn terrible movies lately. I watched one of them he did with John Travolta and I was like, what did they pay him to do this? This is ridiculous. Some John Travolta plays like the worst Russian accent ever. It's the both like killers and John Travolta's chasing him through the woods. They're shooting arrows at each other. It's like, it's so stupid. It's so stupid. You, you watched the preview and you see like the obvious stuntman that's falling down and like, what am I. This is an episode of the $6,000,000 man that he turned into a fucking movie like this. It's so fucking bad. Well, he was great. And uh, what were they? Meet the fockers all those. Oh yeah. Well, he's creating a lot. I mean, look, he's one of the greatest actors of all time. Region, bowl, deer, hunter, taxi driver.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       I mean, you can't, we can't take away what he's done, but I think they get to a certain point. I'm like, fucking, who cares? Give me the check. I'll do your stupid fucking movie. Oh, okay. Travolta and I were in the woods shooting arrows at me. All right, let's go. It's like Pierce Brosnan. He's been in a couple of kind of lower end things and he was bond not that long ago. Yeah. He was like the least believable bond ever. Like, I'm like, this guy ain't kicking no one's ass. He's breaking his own hands. Like, this is not the. He's not going to knock people out. He's of hurt himself. You think Daniel Craig is more believable? He's the most believable ever. For sure. He's the only guy. Like you look at him with his shirt off, you know, that guy's a killer. Like he looks like a real killer.

Speaker 1:          00:53:14       It looks like he could fuck you up. You know, you look at Pierce Brosnan with his shirt off and you're like, this guy, all you have to do is run up a flight of stairs and wait for him. Like he's not going to make it. It's not kicking everybody's ass better. Be Quick. If he kicks your ass better, not take time because he's not going to be there 30, 40 seconds into this. This is not going to be. He's going to be huffing and puffing. It's going to be over. He's more of a gun, a gun based bond. He's a pretty man is very, very nice hair, you know, but I don't buy them as like a bad ass like beating people up. They could get away with that back in the day. Like if you go back and watch the original Batman and robin like Adam West, Adam West, it looked like maybe someone made them do a pushup at one point in time.

Speaker 1:          00:53:58       You know what I mean? But it in no way shape or form. Do you look like an athlete? You know, he didn't look like my Christian Bale nightclub. Exactly like Christian Bale and Batman was. He's a monster. He looks like a bad ass. Which is pretty impressive because that's coming off just like six months from him doing the machinists where he got down to some ungodly low weight. Like I think he was like 140 pounds or something like that and he's a big guy. It might even been lower. Yeah, he's the real deal. Oh, talking about good actors, no one is come closer to dying for a role. Then that guy did in a role that sucked. I mean that movie sucked. I didn't see the machinists. It was okay, but it was not. Not The movie you want almost die for, but you got to think also that a guy that's losing that much weight and essentially starving himself to death like that.

Speaker 1:          00:54:49       Like that guy doesn't have much energy to act either. That's the catch 22. It's like you lose that much weight, like your body is fucking struggling. Like everything is hard to do. Getting up out of bed. It's hard to do. You're dying. Your body body's eating itself and the only way to get that, that lean in that thin there is on the left. Wow, that's incredible. That's him on the right. Six months later that it's unreal. Yeah, but that's shit that he did to himself to get to the guy on the left. He probably ruined his organs. I mean, he probably took years off of his life. Very, very, very hard on your body to get that thin. You're eating yourself. Your body starts atrophying. It starts absorbing its own muscle tissue and stay alive. It's [inaudible]. That's where you're getting your protein from to eating its own body as fucked.

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       That is fucked for a goofy movie. Fifty cents. Did it too for something people are going to make fun of on a podcast years later. Well, some people might have enjoyed it and I don't know, just I didn't think it was that good and he's. He's a great actor. I love them in a lot of things. It's just that wasn't. It wasn't worth fucking doing, man. Jesus Christ. How do we get on him? Losing weight? How the fuck did we even go down this road? I'm not sure. Probably through bitcoin somewhere. Another. I want to drive home. The bitcoin thing that like everybody out there, it's too late because you were saying like, would it be cool if, if it would happen, it's sort of is, you know, this is the point where people who are not tech savvy and not Bill Gates or Richard Branson need to look into it because those

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       people have already made their, their beds. You know, like Richard Branson, very much a believer in bitcoin. Bill Gates went on Bloomberg and said Bitcoin is better than currency. Like that was only part of his statement. It was like bitcoin is better than currency in that. And then he explained why, but what's so weird about that is Bill Gates back in 1995 was on Letterman, basically the same kind of interview, but about the Internet and the audience back then thought he was just as full of shit as people today think bitcoin is kind of this, this fad, when it's really not like Bill Gates isn't in the pumping bullshit business. Well here's the reality

Speaker 5:          00:57:01       of Bitcoin or have anything that's not a fully formed. Absolutely successful shift. Okay. Whatever it is, we don't know. We don't know. We might think that bitcoin is it and it might become, what's that other stuff? Doge coin and Doggy coin, whatever. There are hundreds of them now. There's hundreds of them, so there might be one that comes along a few years from now that's like ethically engineered. Somebody comes along and some great minds, mathematicians and economists get together and they come up with a formula that everyone agrees to and they launch it and it's like the fucking large Hadron collider where you get 10,000 scientists from 100 different countries working on this one project and they come up with a universal form of currency and essentially figure out some sort of a way to slowly but surely even out the the, the cultures financial, a distribution of wealth and that's like a huge issue with people.

Speaker 5:          00:57:56       The distribution of wealth. That's some because some people are like, fuck you man, I earned this money, and then some people are like, fuck you. The only way you could have that much money is if you've done something wrong or if you found a loophole in a system that was absolutely unjust and once that loopholes been created and once that position has been established, it's almost impossible to even things out. This is not an even playing field, especially if you inherited that money or you got an a fucking divorce, you know, like all that kind of shit.

Speaker 3:          00:58:22       That's why this is so brilliant. I mean that, that innovation of the money being created through mining, it was a pretty smart idea because now the distribution is, for lack of a better word, fair. And even today, like when I left the house, bitcoin was at around $380, three 85 chicken every day.

Speaker 5:          00:58:38       Stock Market. I do you one of those freaks.

Speaker 3:          00:58:41       Uh, I just check it because I can't not check it. It's not so much about that. It's just interesting to watch. So it was around 380 something and I was thinking about how people go, oh, three 80, that's too expensive for a bitcoin. I'm not, I'm going to wait until it drops, right. What you're actually buying is. So one bitcoin equals 1 million bits and already some of those services like a light change tip or switching over to bits instead of bitcoins because it's easier for the mind, you know, it's easier to say you've received 5,000 bits than point zero five, you know, whatever. Um, so that is happening. And I think that in a few years' time, maybe like years from now, people will look back on this era and go, Holy Shit. That was insanely undervalued because that's what happened four years ago. Like my whole thesis, my thesis is that we have bitcoin in five years. Well that, that's possible too, but if it does happen, I think that it's one of those things where we are not even in the, like I think um, there's a, there's a cycle to a product and we're not even in the first stage of that cycle

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       maybe. Or it's like Betamax looked promising and fucking fizzled off way before. And then something that wasn't even as good became much more successful. But I think we can agree then that one of these cryptocurrencies is gonna is gonna work. Hopefully that guy, it might not be one of the ones that's currently available. I mean these cryptocurrencies didn't exist a decade ago. I mean, think about that. A decade is a very brief window in time. It is 2004. No cryptocurrencies, 2014 over a hundred. I mean, how many other there are hundreds, hundreds and thousands. Well, let's think about this. Let's say a lot. So

Speaker 3:          01:00:20       coin one of the lingering problems is like, all right, you have bitcoin and it has whatever economic value it ends up having a. and you say you can use it as money and that's great, but what you still have that's an issue is the need for financial institutions. If I want to earn interest on my Bitcoin, I have to give it to somebody,

Speaker 1:          01:00:38       right? But why do you have to earn interest on your money? What? That's like a firmly established thing and people's minds that you have money, you put it away somewhere when you earn interest. Like that's just how people are trained, you know, this is stupid, everything is stupid. That's really stupid. The idea that you give your money to a bank and the bank just hangs onto it and spends it a little bit here and there and loans and out, and then keeps as much as they can. So if you ever want it back and go,

Speaker 3:          01:00:59       well it's, it sounds stupid because it's been so, uh, it's been perverted in the favor of institutions and not in the favor of individuals. So one of these ideas is if you give your money to a bitcoin bank and they pay you interest, there's still the possibility that that bank can fail and they have to make the money somewhere. So they have to loan out things and take risks. And they could fail. There's a currency, actually a bunch of them, but I'm, one of them is hyper and the algorithm actually creates its own interest. So unlike bitcoin where it just sits there, this coin, just by running it on your computer, you earn more of the coins. So what they've done is created so that anybody with just a normal computer can run the software that actually creates more currency for that network. Because with bitcoin you can only do that if you're running the mining hardware, which is really kind of expensive and observe

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       you're at work. Those, is that an infant growth paradigm is that the idea behind it just continues on forever and ever and continues to generate interest. It doesn't continue forever because it in five years it scales down and then it scales down again that scales down through the software, through the schedule. It's all been scheduled at the same with Bitcoin, with Bitcoin, the bitcoin is just the amount that gets made. The last

Speaker 3:          01:02:14       I'm using the word interest, what it really is, is they found a way to, um, with Bitcoin, the miners are the ones who are earning new coins by running that algorithm. This algorithm, just by running the wallet, you're supporting the network and running those transactions for people. So as a result, you're going to get a percentage of those coins. And so they've just kind of democratized the mining process. So now every single user is essentially a minor and it changes the way you think about money because with Bitcoin, what bitcoin did is, you know, underneath the central bank to issue money, you now have money. It just exists. And with things like hyper, you no longer have the need for a bank to issue interests because the coin itself is capable of bearing interest. So you have something that just cannot be corrupted by any kind of, um,

Speaker 1:          01:02:58       yeah. But who the fuck is using hyper? Is it one percent of the people that use bitcoin? Is it even that, you know, how many people are using bitcoin? That's a tiny percentage of the population of renting. So you're dealing with a tiny percentage, a tiny percentage. It's still very.

Speaker 3:          01:03:11       It's used by Gamers and online worlds, which was fucking gamers. The online world thing is becoming more of a, an economy because in a few years people are going to have oculus rifts on and they're going to be exploring around in their living rooms and even though they're just on a video game, everything they do has some kind of real economic value. If you can port that value in somehow you could do neat thing.

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       We're going to be in the Matrix inside of 20 years. In 20 years we're going to be just like Keanu Reeves, a big fucking Frisbee in the back of her head, kind of connected to a tube. You think we'll have to write into the system and go out full ai within 20 years so you can just ask Siri and it's. Yeah, I think you'll have robots. You'll have like a person like a robot Butler or something like that that hands around hangs around your house and hands you things and does things for you and schedules things. If the robot girlfriend while you. That's going to be an ethical dilemma, but I think that's probably coming to ethical dilemma I've already resolved. Yeah, you were cool with it. I'm set just fucking around, but I want you to suck it up. You're telling the truth. If you've had a really hot like traci lords in her prime robot, fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:04:16       If I really couldn't tell the difference and other people couldn't either. That's where the problem sets and like, well why wouldn't you order when she starts crying when you leave and you're like, what the fuck? I didn't know that. Well, it's like an interstellar. You have to deprogram. I didn't see it. Don't give any spoilers. You fuck up, dare you. This boilers, the, the idea of ais is very captivating and the idea of Ai to me is very similar to the idea of what must have been the idea of the atomic bomb before it was initially dropped. I think the idea of doing it, it's almost, it's so compelling. It's impossible to not do it. And in that case, like with the atomic bomb, of course it was like during the war and they were worried about the Nazis coming up with it first, but if there was no war going on, I'm pretty sure they were still wouldn't come up with the fucking atomic bomb. They just would have, you know, especially if they were worried that somebody else would have first, even if there was no war. But it's one of those things where once you make it, you've made it. The cat's out of the bag and now everybody knows that this is a part of reality and I think that's going to be the case with artificial intelligence. I think there's going to be a. Once you make

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       it, you sure? Okay, hit the button, let him go live and then you know he starts doing things for you and you go to bed. You get up in the mornings from in front of your fucking computer and he's designing a far better robot. It's like you've made mistakes and I want to correct them and here's, here's the best way to design the next level of me and then he designs and makes the next level of him and the next level of him kills all the people. Just fucking smarter people and says, people are a parasite live. We're just going to make robot. People that don't litter don't have any problems and we're all sync up together on one network and our goal is to live harmoniously with all the other life forms on earth with nothing out of balance, and that's we have an algorithm designed to achieve that were indistinguishable biologically from actual people at this point, because we're so advanced with artificial cells, even we can't tell, so what we'll do is we'll just only exist in this form and all these imperfect prototypes that existed essentially just to hatch us.

Speaker 5:          01:06:16       That's all they were. They were just cocooning themselves until they shit out some artificial life. Either there's gonna be a bit of a cylon mentality then yeah, well, there's going to be an elitism. You know, they're going to be smarter than us. They're going to be better than us, and they're gonna realize how flawed we are. Were we? We were a biological computers, okay, but we're biological computers that were never designed or we have been designed by trial and error and natural selection and genetics and learned behavior patterns and adapt to our environments, but at the end of the day, what they're going to be able to do if you really do have artificial intelligence, so you really do create something that's superintelligent artificial. It wasn't born out of cells and mating and evolution. Just something that a human being created, that fucking thing's going to have some real different ideas about how to run shit.

Speaker 4:          01:07:07       It really is like Elon Musk warned that, uh, will be summoning the demon. Yeah, that's what he said. Yeah. Well, I would listen to him, that guy smart as shit. He is way fucking smarter than me. So if I'm worried about it, I'm an idiot. Like literally what are guys who are actually coders? What are they actually thinking? Well, it's neat how, uh, there's an article in wired about this whole ai thing and the article was good until the end when it was like, we need to go on this journey so that these machines will tell us who we are. And that's the part where I was like vomit because Barf, these, these people who are looking at the singularity is this is what we need to get to so they can get personal answers and personal meaning. Have they tried first like a weed Brownie or something? Just to be sure, like I think the. I think the answer is they're looking for are not going to be split up by a computer. I think there are like personal things. I don't think you ever get the answers, man. I think you get some answers. You get some peace. What? I want my money back, all the answers. There's no answers. The,

Speaker 5:          01:08:09       the answers to what? Like here's the big one, right? What is the meaning of life? That's a hard one to crush your enemies

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       there. The three driven them before you knew the laminations of the women laminations limitations and the limitations of their recommendations. Great quote. Apparently. Apparently he wasn't even acting. It was just kind of just letting people know what's at a good. Then there's no meaning of life. Your meaning of life is different than Jamie's mine. Mine's different than yours. It's like we overall different. You would if you were a guy who, uh, really wanted to fix shoes, you know, and you were forced to make podcasts all the time. He'd be bummed out, like, fuck podcasts. I like fixing shoes. That'd be some really bad podcasts. And if you were in that shoe fixer place that I told you about, he'd be bummed out. But like, this is bullshit. I want to talk about bitcoin. He'd be like, do people know about bitcoin? I accept shoe payments going in anyway possible.

Speaker 1:          01:09:08       I'll accept bitcoin. I mean, we all, all, everybody's life is different. There's some people's lives that they love that you would want to fucking kill yourself. Like if you, if you had to live as a fucking fur trapper in the middle of Canada, you'd kill yourself and be like, I can't do this. I'm taking a jet ski to Work Everyday or Wales Snow Skis. Actually, my level, the level of enjoyment would totally depend on if there is a medical marijuana because if there was, I would love the winter there. Would you be high as fuck in a log cabin? Yes. I would be panicking though. You'd be like, dude, I'm going to freeze to death out here. I'm going to run out of what I'm going to have to eat the house I'm gonna have to like, like my house on fire to heat it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:43       There's, there's times where you're living in those places where you have to go out and get wood and it's 30 below zero. You gotta go outside, start chopping down wood because if you don't, you're not going to make it. Yeah. I don't like those kinds of situations. Wherever, anything, anything that ends in your role, you're not going to make it. Yeah. That's where I draw the line. Especially if you're like kind of cold here in bed already or already cold, you're wrapped up and you're freezing and you're looking over at the log pie like, oh my God, I'm not going to get through the night. I'm going to have to go outside. Shit. Then you realize like, okay, how far is the closest trees?

Speaker 1:          01:10:19       Let's do this. Let's do this. Let's do this. Shut the door and it opens because the wind is blowing so strong. You have to shut it again and pull it tight. Pole at shots and you're out there with a fucking hack saw with snowshoes on the wind's blowing sideways. Your fucking freezing and you think to yourself, I don't know how much longer I could stay out here and it sounds like the worst airbnb vacation. Somebody didn't read the full description. Negative 30 degrees. Fucking wolves everywhere. Well, that's the real scary thing, man. Not global warming. Global warming, scary. The oceans rise. Oh my God, we lost Malibu. Yeah, that's scary. But what's really scaring global cooling. That's the really scary shit. Go back into an ice age. Oh God, that was then. Then your bitcoins won't save you, unfortunately. Have you seen cave of forgotten dreams? The Werner Herzog film? I have not. I watched it again the other night.

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       Um, it's really amazing. It's about this

Speaker 5:          01:11:18       cave in France. I would say France, but I'm fucking American. So I say it my way. This, this cave, it was, they found these really, really old cave paintings that were like twice as old as the oldest cave paintings that had ever been found. There were like 40,000 plus years old and there's all these animals like animal bones in the cave, like, like bears that don't even exist anymore. Like, like this crazy cave bear thing and this guy, Werner Herzog as the narrator and he's going over all the artwork and all the different things and you just think about what it must have been like to live in this era and be like these people and you realize, oh my God, these people. This was before the fucking ice age. This was like 40,000 years ago. This is before the ice age ended, like 10,000 years ago. So this was like full on different world. This was back when North America was covered in ice. This is back when the continents were connected and you could

Speaker 4:          01:12:20       walk from Russia to Alaska. It was all frozen ground. I must have been a weird time. Fuck, are you kidding me? Do people walked here from Russia also? Not a lot of generational progress. You know, you get the whole generations where your life is pretty much the same as your parents and their parents. That's a good point now. Like there's a decent chance that if I have kids someday, my kids will be on a spaceship at some point in their lives. Very possibly the, we don't fuck it up. I don't think we will. I think, uh, I think we're on a decent path now. I was really concerned for a few years because it was kinda creepy. All the surveillance stuff and you're not concerned anymore. I mean, I'm still concerned about those things, but I think that now the math is kind of set in our favor. You know, when, whenever something starts to take off, it just, it happens. You know, this is surveillance stuff. The real issue is going to be for them that as technology becomes more and more pervasive, it's

Speaker 5:          01:13:19       it's going to connect everybody to it so it's not going to be possible to shield themselves from the impact of that and it's all in a lot of ways. It's like the Internet itself, like when they made the Internet, they didn't really foresee what the potential uses of it. We're going to be. They use that as a method where they could send information. There was a a network that they could connect and send files back and forth to different computers. I mean that was essentially the original idea behind it, but along the way they unintentionally engineered the greatest revolution of thought that the human race has ever seen. By far in my lifetime. I've seen radical changes in the way people view ideas, establish truths, find out information on their phone within seconds, get access. It's essentially the database of the human race. I mean this is.

Speaker 5:          01:14:15       This is a big crazy fucking change and it happened in our lifetime and it happened really quickly and it happened because nobody saw it comment and I think that what they're doing inadvertently by spying on people, by checking everybody's emails and by checking everybody's text messages, there are inadvertently creating technology that they thought would empower them. They thought this top technology is going to allow us to keep an eye on all these. No good troublemakers out there, but what they didn't consider is it's eventually going to grow and expand to the point where keeps an eye on youtube. Bitch. You too. It's going to know you're here, blah, blah, blah, blah. Made me, but we need a firewall. There's no such thing. It's not this thing. We've gotten nano. There's no firewalls anymore, man. Everybody has access to everything else, so this is what it is and now everybody knows you're a pedophile and now everybody knows you're a fucking creep.

Speaker 5:          01:15:07       Now everybody knows. You know, the only reason why you got your job is because you bribed such and such and paid off this and that and you have this really unethical deal with this company to does this to the land and now you're going to be responsible because you knew that they were poisoning those rivers and here's all these children that were born with birth defects that lived down river from this in these small villages because they didn't have a say because they didn't have any political representation and no one had to say at the fucking meeting when you said it was okay to dump toxic slime into the fucking river. All that's gonna happen is you're going to be accountable for all crimes against humanity. Anybody who's doing anything that the American public looks at the world view looks at and says, Hey, you motherfuckers are profiting off of suffering. Whether it's doctors that got paid off money to create laws or to help establish laws, to advise on laws that make no sense. That eventually wound up getting more people locked up for drug offenses. There's doctors that have been paid off. By that I mean that was the big thing before Sanjay Gupta when I mean kinda like completely flipped the switch and went pro medical marijuana,

Speaker 3:          01:16:15       pro human being and throw humor, CNN.

Speaker 5:          01:16:18       Well he was being paid off by pharmaceutical companies. That was like one of the big things. It was found out about him. Dr Drew, same thing. They get

Speaker 3:          01:16:24       paid, they get paid to be consultants. They get paid to give advice. You know, it's so disgusting in 2014 that the state of Florida only lost the medical marijuana thing by a few percentage points to add to get to 60 percent. And I think the guy around 57, 57, 56, I think it was six, something like that, is that because there's so many people in pain in the state of Florida and they have to go on shit like Oxycontin, which is dangerous and your shit your liver out. We'd since the time of Jesus, not a single overdose and they're not, they're not giving people access to it. It's just so. It's so in your face corrupt and you're like, well, what is the other reason for it? And there is not a reason.

Speaker 5:          01:17:00       It's not corrupt though. It's just they didn't make it. They didn't do a good job and they didn't get to the 60 percent. They needed to change the constitution. That's what it is to get past

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       as far as like public, like what you like 50 percent. But there is anti anti legalization money spent. Of course there's always going to be in get ready old people, old people are dumb as fuck and the floors infested with them and they still believe that marijuana is make your fucking feet fall off and you hear your ears go numb and you're fucking one. I'm just going to make the jazz too loud and to make the jazz too loud and they have that white penis is shrink. A black penises actually get larger. They don't know. You know, they think marijuana's a about chocolate study to gives your brain damage. You know, there's always a study that they can somehow or another recall they might've saw on the back page of us weekly, you know, who the fuck knows? It's hard. It's hard getting a bunch of people on board with especially something that they don't have anything to do with.

Speaker 1:          01:17:56       If they're all golfing, I don't want these goddamn kids. Their pot trying to get my golfing in my golf game's picked up. David Chapman. I didn't want to fucking pot heads out here and ruin in golf. For me that is. That is the counterpoint, but they were, you know, they were close to 60 percent, which is what they needed to change the constitution, the state constitution. Sure. They'll get it next time around. They should know they should finish points, four percentage points. It would be really dumb for them financially to ignore the fact that the money's being spent no matter what you do, it's just being spent in going into the hand of drug dealers or I'm paying taxes. It's a stupid strategy, right? Like you're denying people access to money, but the people that are doing it, they're, they're, they're cannibals. I mean, these people that are the pharmaceutical companies that are so concerned with this marijuana coming in and fucking everything up, they're spending millions and millions of dollars to demonize it and they.

Speaker 1:          01:18:48       They've donated shitloads of money to a partnership for a drug free America. Like all of that is just just a strategy to make whatever they're selling have a longer shelf life. If they can keep selling it for two, three, four more years, whatever it is, whatever money grabbed they're on right now. You know, our studies show we can, we can keep our finger in this dike for up to 16 more months. I mean we have 80 percent old people and none of them are online and they're not googling shit, so let's just tell them that marijuana makes black people go crazy. It makes them go crazy and start dancing on white people's cars. Isn't that weird to learn that? That is actually the basis for drug policy was a racist, racist doctor in Louisiana in the 19 thirties and then Nixon being insane. Well, it wasn't even Nixon. It was way before Nixon. Of course it was. The whole idea was if you believe the story was all engineered by William Randolph hearst or to sell more, he wanted to make sure that he gets cell paper that was made from trees. We had paper he had. He not only did he own a newspaper companies, you know, whatever, uh, newspapers, but he also owned these processing mills and these giant chunks of land that were filled with and he would chop the trees

Speaker 5:          01:20:08       down and turn them in. Well, he was going to have to convert everything to hemp. Hemp was going to be the new paper. It's way better paper and amazing to this day that the paper we use on a daily basis is made out of trees because it's the stupidest way to make paper. It takes way too long to generate like acres of trees that are viable that you can chop down and turned into paper with the marijuana every fucking year. You've got a new giant crop. He chopped that shit down. Your replanted. It grows like a weed because it is a fucking weed. It gets huge really quick. It, it's fucking ridiculous how fast pot grows. And the paper far superior, like the fibers way stronger. It's light, it's strong. You can make houses with it, you know, it's like they make particle board, it's like the shitty type of plywood and they make it with like little chips of wood from a lumber yard and they glue it all together and press it. That when they make that shit with him, it's way stronger, way lighter.

Speaker 3:          01:21:03       It's good for clothing too. There's a company in Santa Monica that makes polo shirts and they just. They wick much better than a cotton polo shirt. You don't feel as sweaty and gross by the end of the day.

Speaker 5:          01:21:14       It's amazing. It's almost ridiculous how many uses hemp and marijuana have. It's almost ridiculous when you look at the fact that it's actually an illegal plant in most of the country. Even hemp, the non psychoactive version of it, that it's illegal in most of the country in 2014. It just.

Speaker 3:          01:21:30       This goes back to the status thing. It's like people aren't some kind of trance like I definitely like I see the need for laws and roads and everything, but just because something is illegal that you put something on a sheet that says controlled substances. It's completely arbitrary. Nobody outside of the United States even recognizes that and historically speaking, people have been around for thousands of years and using this plant. So where does that arrogance seep in that you can just put something on a sheet of paper and suddenly like everybody's lifestyle has to change or if they don't you can put them in.

Speaker 5:          01:22:02       It goes back to what we were talking about before. So this all happened because you, you had like a disconnect between people and the distribution of information. You know, if you, if you stood on top of our platform and said, here you hear Yeahi find people of the town, the king has come forth with the new law, the new law, the states, and you say that, and then the people are left in this helpless state. Like fuck, this is the law. While again, this is the law now and you don't, you don't get a line of communication and you get this weird sense of separation like, well, oh, that person is different. He's the king, and he passes like, no, he's a fucking person. They're all just people and that is what's being exposed was being exposed as there is no special. There's just people.

Speaker 5:          01:22:45       Just because you're the president doesn't mean you get to lock people up because they want to smoke pot. Just because you're a judge doesn't mean if I say fuck you to you, it's different than you saying, fuck you. To me it's the same. We're just people. If you say fuck you, you shouldn't say fuck you. That's really kind of mean, but it's also a mean to say go to hell. It's, you know, it's mean to say you. It's, it's mean to say mean things. Everybody knows what the fuck got it. That entails. So this idea that they're more important or they're more valuable or their, you know, their, their state of mind is to be looked at with higher regard than yours. They're to be treated with reverence, all rise. The honorable David Seaman has entered the room and you walk in with your fucking goofy 15 hundreds outfit on you, the bib on, please be seated and everybody sits down after you do, of course you sit first, you're in charge.

Speaker 5:          01:23:38       It's fucking ridiculous and gavel and that, that, that kind of thinking is very similar to censorship in a way that it's disempowering and it's frustrating and it's confusing. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't ring true and it's, it's essentially, it's capitalizing on this leftover Alpha male primate behavior system that we have stuck in our heads from when we're just trying to survive. We're just trying to get away from predators and get to the highest branches and figure out where the cats couldn't get to us. You know, and so the people that lived the longest were the strongest. Those are the ones you wanted to follow up because they're still alive. Follow them and you'll make it. If you don't follow them, you're probably not gonna. Make It. That's the leader. Follow the leader. We've got to get out of here. That's shit still stuck in our DNA.

Speaker 5:          01:24:23       It's still a groove that's been dug into the fucking pathways of our behavior systems and we were struggling with that. We're still struggling with that and I think ultimately that's one of the real problems with like the idea of a group of people leading millions to war. It's one of the problems with the idea of a group of people dictating how money gets distributed and who gets to say what and all of that is very similar in a way and that we really can't have it anymore. We're too interconnected. We can't accept it, we don't. We don't accept it. It's frustrating and it causes descent and it's all ultimately it's unfair and it's only. It only exists because it's always existed. If you want it to refashion our culture. Say if something happened, the White House got hit by a meteor, like the fucking penthouse got hit by another one.

Speaker 5:          01:25:16       This doesn't make any sense. It's been proven. It's from space, but why would they only hit know if that did happen and we have no central office be pretty obvious that their intentions were God would be super pissed, but we had to reengineer our society. I don't think there's a fucking snowball's chance in hell. We would go back to the presidential system. It'd be bitcoins and pre roll joints. A localized system. They would be. Yeah, without a doubt. First thing we do is legalize LSD, psilocybin dmt, all those things. Legalized startup centers, startup centers where people get your head together, you know, instead of subways there'll be like, get, get your head togethers and there'll be everywhere and stock staffed by professionals and people always get tired of me saying that like, yeah, the drugs really the answer to

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       everything. No, they're not the answer to everything, but they're the doorway to the answer to everything and there is no answer to everything by the way, but they're, they're, they're a real good indicator of whether or not you're on the right track. There

Speaker 3:          01:26:15       was it like I will after I did something over the summer and had some interesting experiences. Uh, one of my old friends said, congratulations on becoming a human being, which I thought it was a little patronizing at first, but then I was thinking about it and I was like, yeah, actually when you're an adult and you hit your late twenties or early thirties, if you haven't had any kind of altered states like that, it's just your loss, you know, it's like you can totally live your life out to the fullest without any of that stuff, but you have avoided something that was incredibly beautiful and different and we'll let you see things in a different way. And everybody who has that experience, they come back to earth, so to speak as a different person. Like if you, if you look online and you search for Steve Jobs, lsd quote, you can see one of the top results is what he had to say about that. You wouldn't necessarily get this unless you read his biography. He was a big advocate of psychedelics. I mean Steve Jobs, but he wasn't a regular user, which I found fascinating. We use the 10 or 15 times,

Speaker 1:          01:27:11       stopped, stopped a long time. Yeah, I mean it wasn't like he was using it towards the end of his life.

Speaker 3:          01:27:16       Well, it's like Alan Watts says, Alan Watts said, if you get the, a, you get the message, hang up the receiver, hang up the phone, which I think is a great way of thinking about it in some ways. You know, you've got steve jobs of whatever he needed.

Speaker 1:          01:27:27       Right. But isn't it arrogant to think that you've already got the message? Maybe a little. Yeah. I've never felt like any psychedelic experience. The latest one was just a month ago or a couple months ago, right before I fell my special. So I guess it was August and um, uh, I didn't feel like I got the message. I felt like, oh, I got another message, you know? It was, it was interesting. It was definitely enlightening or illuminating. It definitely caused me to stop and think about it every day. I think about it all the time, but I would never be so cocky as to say I got the message. Like every time I do it, I feel like there's a new message or a new connection that I'm making or a new level of the game that my mind gets access to.

Speaker 3:          01:28:15       Well, here's, here's what's cocky is to be somebody who's never touched any of these things and you go at can't possibly have value for other people. And it's like, well, how do you know that? Especially if you know that's a, that's a trap. Like you and I were talking before we started rolling Lisa Ling documentary, which aired on CNN about the Iowasca ceremonies in South America. Uh, my mom had it on Dvr. And so when I went home for Thanksgiving, she was like, Oh, do you want to watch the documentary? And I put it on and I was expecting it to be the typical cnn take on, uh, on psychedelics, you know. And then she started talking about this young boy who died down there. And I was like, oh, great, that's gonna be the focus of the whole fucking hour is this idiot. But as it turned out, it was an incredibly fair take.

Speaker 3:          01:29:00       And it followed, uh, experience of some Marines who had posttraumatic, uh, know ptsd really bad, like to the extent that they couldn't be around other people because they were afraid of harming those people. And you can see the transformation take place. They become more peaceful and more self aware. And that's not even the whole, the whole thing. You know, they're just filming a little portion of it for the documentary. Uh, some of these guys are doing it repeatedly. Really interesting stuff. Like I don't see how a, if you're one of those people who's like, this should be walled off from everybody. If there's medical benefit happening, why not?

Speaker 1:          01:29:32       Well, those people that should be walled off, why? What? Where's the bodies? What's going on? This one kid died. First of all, no one has any idea what their kid died from. And don't

Speaker 3:          01:29:42       all shady towns in South America by herself as a little teenager asking where the software is, the Iwatch

Speaker 1:          01:29:47       like at high out of my mind that somebody is going to take advantage of you. Who knows? Who knows if that's what happened. I really don't know. That was the Tldr. What happened was that now I'm just, I'm making it, but did somebody do something to somebody? They prove it. They found they found a body, right? He might've been murdered. We really don't know, and this idea that you have to do in South America only exists because it's illegal in America. That's stupid you can be doing at Columbia University if they would take some of these things off of schedule one. Yeah. If you do DMT, you're essentially doing the most potent form of the drug and Sin Iowasca if you smoke it and when you do that, you don't need to be anywhere. You're seen to be somewhere where you sit down. It doesn't matter where you are, you're going somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          01:30:29       You're going to another fucking dimension. It's, it's, it's not like something like you have to be in South America to hit that spot. Like, no, it's right here. It's like you get there in 15 seconds. It's not far away at all. It's, it's the most disturbing aspect of it is the accessibility. Once you, once you smoke it, the accessibility of this other dimensions, so bizarre, mean probably even more intense if you do it in this ancient indigenous environment, you're in the jungle and you're freaking out and South America and he's blowing smoke on you and you're here in fucking Jaguars and shit. I can't wait to try that out sometime. It's going to be interesting. You can. There's places that are doing it now in California. There's places that are doing it in the mountains. Well, I might go to the budget and I might go to the budget route.

Speaker 1:          01:31:12       Then California. Well you mean you have to worry about some things happening everywhere you go. You know, especially you go someplace and you have to trust all these people and you're getting blasted out of your mind, but when you think about how many people are doing it now and you think about how many bad reports are coming back, it's fairly fairly low. With women, they have to worry more because I know Amber Lyon, she had an issue with a guy that was grabbing her while she was under. It was a shaman who had to flee the scene apparently, but he had done that to other women as well. You got to, if you're a woman, you have to worry about that kind of shit about some creepy dude who's doing weird things to people when they're under. Yeah, and I guess he would have to worry about that as a dude too. You know, if you got the wrong shaman, you don't. You don't want to wake

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       up without a couple of organs. You know

Speaker 5:          01:32:01       what's, you know, what it is is it's become a popular thing and when it's become a popular thing is going to be people that want to capitalize on that. There's so much money involved. These IOWASCA tours, people are doing them in there. You know, every person's spending thousands of dollars and you're getting, you know, 20 people at trip and Woohoo, we're fucking raking it in.

Speaker 3:          01:32:19       And the CNN documentary, they were interviewing one of the local white experts and he was saying, don't buy this stuff at the marketplaces because you just don't know what's in it. You know, some, some person trying to make money off of you as a tourist. That's not the authentic experience, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:32:32       Yeah. That definitely can happen, but the idea that you have to go all the way to South America for an experience that should be legal everywhere in the world is fucking stupid. It's, it's mind numbingly stupid. It makes me angry. It's so stupid that we have to go to these countries that have different laws because on this patch of dirt, they can lock you up and Iowasca is a weird gray area too because it's not totally illegal. It's not legal, but it's not illegal, so you're not extracting it. If you extract dmt from the same plants that make Iowasca and you do the powdered form of it, which you have to smoke to get into your bloodstream, that's illegal. That's schedule one drug. See the fact that all the planets but hold on site, but all the plants that are there that comprise Iowasca, when you mix them together, they're all legal on their own and combining them together. They're still legal, but the drug that you're actually drinking is illegal. So it's a very gray area because they don't have laws on all the different plants are so many fucking plants and it's not exactly an extraction. It's not like a chemical extraction, you know, it's like you're making a stew.

Speaker 3:          01:33:41       Yeah. It just strikes me as so disingenuous how people have to sneak around like that and deal with the specific, um, the, uh, the nuances of the law. Like it just shows you how dishonest the government is. It should be like if you're paying your taxes and you're not staging some kind of insurrection at a walmart and you're not a threat to anybody, you should be left the fuck alone. And that should include like you should have access to certain mind expensing, mind expanding substances.

Speaker 5:          01:34:09       You will, you will more now than ever before and more five years from now than now. It's on the way. There's no way you could stop it at this point in time. Too many people are talking about the positive benefits of it. They're doing stories on CNN about it and much like marijuana has become accepted slowly but surely across the country where I don't care if they do it, just keep it away from me. There's a lot of that going on. There's a lot of. Well the let those fucking dopers have it, but this way get tax money from it.

Speaker 3:          01:34:37       I feel about almost everything. Like, yeah, let them do it. Just keep it away from me. Like why isn't that the approach to almost anything that's not harmful?

Speaker 5:          01:34:43       Well, it should be. It's just like it should be legal to tattoo your face. You know, if you really want to put stars over your forehead, fuck is supposed to stop you do whatever you want. I don't advise it, but you know when you're talking about things like marijuana or psychedelics, Lsd, there's long history of people that have stories of the positive benefits of these experiences, so deny those from people and to deny it without any personal experience of those of those drugs on your own is just ridiculous because you don't know what you're making illegal like you, you. You're listening to what you listening to folk stories about a powder that steers your stole, steals your soul, like what do you what? What? What's what are you basing this on when you're basing it on a schedule, one drug schedule, one drug that your liver makes a schedule, one drug that's made in your lungs, a schedule, one drug that's made by your pineal glands.

Speaker 5:          01:35:34       All little silly. Yeah, come on. Your body's making drugs. Schedule One drugs so you can get arrested for your body makes your body's a drug dealer. Your body's a fucking whore with intent to distribute. It's dumb and it's only allowed because it's been allowed for a long time. If we had to start from scratch today and make an appraisal over what is dangerous, not dangerous for society, we'd have to have a serious consideration about prescription drugs and a serious consideration about alcohol. Those are the really big ones we to. We'd have to really look at the numbers of people that die every year from prescription drugs and they're very problematic there. Huge. The amount of people that get addicted to prescription drugs, very, very problematic. The amount of people that just want prescription drugs, they ask for them, they complain about pains that might not even be there.

Speaker 5:          01:36:20       They exaggerate pains. They might have psychological issues and these people will legitimate physical ailments, but there's a lot of crazy people out there hopped up on pain pills too and they're dying. They're dropping like flies. Thousands and thousands of them every year. You know, we thought nine slash 11 was a big deal and you know, nine slash 11 was awful. 3,000 people died. It was like 100,000 people die every year from drugs and alcohol. It's like alcohol overdoses or like something around 90,000 I think. Prescription drugs. What is the prescription drug deaths? If you had to guess, let's just get add tobacco and you go up by like 400,000, right? Oh yeah. You go up by maybe even as much as half a million just in North America alone. Uh, how many would you think prescription drug deaths every year. Let's guess you said $100,000. I said $100,000 with alcohol. With alcohol. I'm going to go with 20,000 just from prescriptions. Jamie, what do you think? If you had to say I was gonna say way more, but 100,000 sound does sound like a lot. So I'll go with 50 to under. Cut It. I'm saying it's probably going to be around $25,000. Let's see. Fact Sheet, prescription drug overdose in the United States facts sheet each day in the United States, 114 people die from drug overdoses. Another 6,748 are treated in emergency and emergency departments. That's amazing. So out of 7,000, less than 7,000, 6,000, 900, 6,000, 800 plus people

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       that overdose. So only 114 people die everyday though. Yeah. That's pretty impressive though. Good. Good job. Doctors versus marijuana. Zero deaths per day from. Yes. Well no one's. No one's arguing that, but it's pretty high and that's, that's 314 people a day. Three hundred days. When is that? In 2000. Twelve to 22,000 a drug overdose deaths were related to pharmaceuticals. Forty 1000 drug overdose deaths over a total. So I don't know what that means. So 22,000 in 2012 were pharmaceutical drugs. And then there was another, you know, slightly less than 20,000. That was something else. I don't know who the fuck they were.

Speaker 1:          01:38:52       A lot of people though, dude, it is in 2011. One point 4 million people had visited the emergency room for nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Wow. So people misusing their actions, they're freaked out and went to the emergency room nod, non medicinal use. You know, they, they borrowed somebody's pills. Yeah, we're weird man. It's weird how much people need to change their state. I mean, even when we're talking about, you know, Iowasca being able to help people and psychedelic drugs, being able to show people new states of consciousness and new ways of being, it's his fucking really weird that human beings need that, that we need to alter our perception like that. Like what, what, what a weird animal. Like an animal that alters its perception by what it puts into its body. Like it doesn't just exist like say like a cheetah or a bear or a, uh, an eagle now.

Speaker 4:          01:39:54       Now we exist and we change. We move her and we think we know how important consciousness is. Oh yeah. We were the only ones that can communicate. Like even this conversation I can confidently say at least on my end would not be as good without drinking less coffee. So, you know, I'm, I'm making use of chemicals right now.

Speaker 1:          01:40:10       Yeah. And maybe a little bit. Yeah. We love to change. Our state is, I mean, a few animals do in some animals drink like fermented juices and monkeys get drunk. Rent. Yeah. They'll find like berries and things that have been fermented fruits that are fermented and they'll drink that and they'll get fucked up. Yeah. People, uh, people have this weird desire changed their state, but the also I think, you know, we look at what that is, Oh, you're drinking booze. Oh, you're doing this. But what you're essentially doing when you're changing your state is you're using technology. You're using information that has been passed on from generation to generation

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       where people figured out techniques to do like a pharmacological intervention on your consciousness. We figured out a way to combine this with that. The way to fucking take the grapes and you smash them and then you stuff in a barrel. You let it sit for six. You know, all this was all like concocted. These are all like solutions to dealing with the problems of the ego, the problems of mundane consciousness and the problems of like getting stuck in patterns where we knew even just getting drunk, getting drunk. Sometimes we'll reset a pattern and make you look at things in a better way. Like you could have like a bad breakup. You go out with your friends, you get drunk and you're like, oh, I'll be fine. He crash, lie in your bed. It heads fucking spinning your beds or you wake up in the morning, you're, your head's throbbing, but you had a bit of a change of perception like you, you use that shamanic ritual of going out and getting hammered and doing shots with your friends to bond and to have an altered state of perception and altered state of how you view the world.

Speaker 3:          01:42:01       Yeah, I, uh, I think people have that all the time. Like I actually, I liked the, uh, inception aspect of, of doing, um, mind altering substances where if you can change the way you think about something, it actually does. This sounds a little trippy, but it changes physical reality because then you start to act in this new way. People pick up on it, they go, Huh, this is working out for David Seaman. Maybe I'll act in this new way and be less of this kind of person. It just kind of becomes contagious. And the example of that that I had recently was going through a Tsa checkpoint already extremely high just to see kind of how I dealt with it. And first of all, all of that kind of pressure just fades away. So when I was like taking out my wallet, I was like sorting through my cards and like just taking my sweet ass time, you know, like totally oblivious to the fact that there's like this machine there that's trying to keep you, you know, just moving forward in everything so secure and we're, you know, we're screening people out.

Speaker 3:          01:42:56       And what I noticed was that this is really all just one big ritual. It's like the Shaman patting you on the head before you go into the hut, you're just trying to make people not be terrified before they enter an airport. Like you're in the safe zone now. And once I had that realization that all of this is fucking theater, that they're not really trying to oppress you, they're just trying to do this thing very quickly to make people feel like they've been. They've been screened. And Yeah, there's definitely that. So it, for whatever reason, it made the animosity that I had retained go away because I saw that like all of my anger over the inefficiencies of the surveillance state and that stuff, these fucking people asking me to take off my shoes take off my shoes are just workers and in fact I can have fun with them. We can have a good time, we can be friendly. We don't have to be dicks about it.

Speaker 5:          01:43:45       Yeah, I mean it's, it's unfortunate that we think that we need something like that. It

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       is incredibly wasteful. It's ridiculous because all of the, all of the medicine is happening behind the scenes. It's intelligence. They know before you enter that airport, if you are a threat or not, at least they should and take off your belt and take off your shoes. That does not. My favorite thing about going through the TSA is when they break character, you know, like you have like a lot of urban folk working there. And uh, there was three of them the other day and they were like, sir, you know, put, you know, put your belt into the basket. Make sure check your phone. Do you have any keys in your pockets? Nothing changed. Okay. Step up and you know everyone's being sir ma'am. And then in the middle of all this, they, they, they break out into. I told that motherfucker he got no that shit ain't gonna work over here.

Speaker 1:          01:44:33       That shit ain't gonna work over here and you tell him and they're like going back and forth that Sir sir, did you take your cell phone off? Please put it in. I like. So they had this brief moment where they crack. They will laugh and joking around with each other, not just humanity but who they really are. And then they go back to this robot voice and they tell him like, oh, you're just regular people that are working inside this machine and you got to talk machine talk, you know, please take your shoes off. Put them in the baskets. If you have a laptop, take it out of its case. Put It on a tray by itself. No liquids. That's just all part of the ceremony. They're doing the ceremony for you. Well they're just safety ceremony. Their workers, man. It's a shit job to a bunch of people who don't want to be there and listening to you. You gotTa fucking tell them what to do. Check their fucking ID, make sure they're not wearing a turban with a bomb under it. Make make you walk through. The fifth element. Body scanner thing I think is pretty weird. Yeah. It is a some sort of a radio wave too, right? It's like millimeter wave checking you for things.

Speaker 1:          01:45:38       It's just sad when you see like old people go through it. You see like some old dude with a terrible hunch in his back and he's going to get out of his wheelchair and shuffle over and stand there. I watched some lady the other day do it. I didn't think she was going to be able to get out of her wheelchair and they made her walk through that stupid fucking thing and hold their hands up. It's like, do you really think you're dealing with a terrorist here as this with this is a terrorist with osteoporosis who could barely walk? That's a threat. It makes me sad when I see a makes me more sad when I see kids go through it versus old people because they're growing up only knowing that stuff. Yeah, and the get patted down. Chefs in the. I've seen kids get patted down to. I mean, I guess the idea is you don't know who the fucking terrorists are, but come on. It's the numbers. We're dealing with her giant. You know the, the numbers when it comes to things actually happening versus people actually flying. My God, there's a lot of fucking people flying. Flying is one of the safest, one of these single safest things you can do in a lot of ways. I mean, it still doesn't feel like it. You're flying through the fucking really doesn't.

Speaker 1:          01:46:43       Did you hear about the lady got kicked off of a airplane because of her emotional support pig. I think I saw that online. Yeah. It was flaking out on the plane. She has a fucking pig. Crazy ladies flying with a pig and the pig lost his shit on the plane. Starts squeaking and squealing and didn't want to be there. It was the pigs first flight and so, uh, they kicked her off the plane. No good. I think if you're bringing something like that on a plane and it's distracting people, fuck off with all this emotional support animals, it's so stupid. There's a restaurant that I go through in this actress shows up all the time, which was she brings a fucking dog. Weather brings the dog to the restaurant and they have to. The restaurant has to accept the fact that this lady's dog is an emotional support.

Speaker 1:          01:47:23       Dogs, dirty, stupid animals. I love animals and I love dogs. I have two dogs. I love them, but what you're saying is that dog, that dog is in a psychiatrist, shouldn't. You shouldn't be able to get away with that loophole. You know, the idea that you're so fucked up that you can't be without your dog while you eat. It's hygiene issues that we're bypassing hygiene issues for one person's selfishness, their selfishness and their, their emotions. You know, I don't know what your dog's been stepping in. I don't know what. What's your dogs' butts going to touch that maybe someone's hands going to touch. It's going to mean there's a lot of weird shit going on when you have like an open asshole, you know, have a dog. It's sitting on the ground where people accidentally might drop their fork, they might not know the next person might be there and they drop their fork right where your dogs butthole was resting on that fucking wood floor and a little scoop add dog, asshole, stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:48:15       It's and it's selfishness. It's indicative of a culture of people that want the rules to bend in their favor because I need to be with my dog. Like you can't bring your dog to a restaurant. It's like people that get upset when the whole cigarette smoking thing and bars get past. This is bullshit. When I go to a bar, I like going to a bar and having a drink and having a fucking smoke and now I got to go outside now. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody shouldn't have to smell your smoke. You dumb ass. They shouldn't have to breathe. Is Stupid air that you've created, like sucking on some chemical soaked leaves that poisoned everybody around you. Yeah. That's not cool just because everybody. Let you do it for so long doesn't mean it's good. That's a perfect example of something where if it didn't exist, you could never invent it.

Speaker 1:          01:49:03       Like you could never invent smoking in bars that didn't exist already. You couldn't fucking invent that. That's not you. People be like, what? Everybody else has to smoke it too. Yeah. It's a new product and it kills Ya. So I'm planning on killing him about a half million people a year. It's really expensive. That's taxed heavily. Smells awful. Your teeth are going to turn yellow. Your liver is going to fall out of your body. Sorry, your lungs, they'll go black. You won't be able to walk upstairs anymore, but you look like a rebel. You'll look cool as fuck. Sign me up. It's just weird. When I see kids still smoking. I saw a 14 year old kid the other day smoking, trying to look cool. Just holding a cigarette. I was like, you fucking dummy. How do you not know? Like you've got to know, but they don't care.

Speaker 1:          01:49:51       They just in their desire to look cool and their desire to be upset. That's like another thing about smoking cigarettes. People love to smoke cigarettes because it almost justifies their shitty attitude they love to do is sit back and look, I'm willing to fucking suck on this cigarette and try to calm me down because we've got to get these fucking orders filled out. You know, like there's this idea that I'm busy, I'm working, I don't even care about my body. Got I got a lot of problems, Gaga, last dress. It's like it reinforces this ridiculous life. It's ridiculous. Life of stress, this ridiculous life of just trying to like. That's so much work to do that be caskey anxiety. It's just fucking life. Just the insane pattern that you're stuck in getting up in the morning, having a couple with your cup of coffee, putting a cigarette in your mouth when you're running out the door, light in that bitch up, driving around, throwing it out the window.

Speaker 1:          01:50:55       As you're driving down the highway, lightened up. Another one you fuckhead. That's us. People goofy as shit. They get extra work breaks too for smoking and it becomes an issue. What do you mean they get extra work breaks? I shouldn't say that they get some workplaces, they allow people to extra work breaks if you smoke because they'll become irritated and become really. Yeah. Oh, and nonsmokers get pissed and that's crazy. And restaurants, it's a big thing because a lot of servers are smokers. It's just a lifestyle for a young person and becomes a huge issue in a lot of times. Wow, that's weird that, that. That's weird that employers would sort of bend to that because if you can hold it in when you were flying on a flight from La to New York, obviously you have to. How come we can't hold it in while you're working?

Speaker 1:          01:51:43       Like obviously you can zoom in for, you know, you have to step outside and nobody else has to carry your load while you're out there killing yourself slowly, but you'd be the least favorite bar back probably at some dive bar. My con can imagine. Well, they probably all do it. That's the thing about dive bars is probably a good percentage of people that are killing themselves slowly together. So they're all team effort right there. Yeah. They used to be places that violated California's law. When they first came out, there was a few places that were allowing people to still smoke. They didn't give a fuck, but they just got heavy fines and they eventually gave up the of those smoker patio still. Right, which are just as gross know if you want to be outside. In Ohio, they built rooms and a lot of places like a permanent tent with heaters and whatnot.

Speaker 1:          01:52:29       It just became an extension of their. They don't have it now. Their bar suffers. Makes Sense, but are you allowed to smoke other things out there like cigars or a pipe out there with a fucking show? Lailey big, big sherlock pipe. Pontificate about the universe. There's A. There's a steakhouse in New York City. Keens steakhouse. You had been there? Yes. The largest pipe section of the walls. Yeah. What does that put those pipes under the old pipes from the. Whenever the late 18 hundreds. Well don't the pipes like represent people that came there. Then they would own their own pipe. So when like they have a pipe that was owned by Teddy Roosevelt, one owned by, I think Mark Twain, just always ridiculous. People would come in, they would request their pipe, smoke it at dinner. I think Einstein had a pipe there. That's crazy. See if there's any photos of people smoking their pipes at that place because I always wonder like that.

Speaker 1:          01:53:21       Do they smoke those pipes or those pipes? Just like, you know, like oh I got brass hat that you like pinned to the wall. This is David Seaman's hat. I think back in the day those fuckers smoked them because I wonder, look, they're all in all. It used to be men's only. I was watching it on tv an old days til like 19. Oh five or something. It was a men's club. Good old days. Dave go there. No broad, big piece of steak. Can I have a fucking meal and smoke a pipe the good old days. But anyway, a woman sued them, some actress back in 19 something and then they opened it up to everybody. Well, you know, didn't they do that recently with that curves joint? The women's only gym did a guy when I joined curves, I'm pretty sure a guy got upset and decided, Bro, I want to join curves.

Speaker 1:          01:54:06       I want curves. I think my hips are too. No, I want to learn your exercises. I want to be a party of Jim. Be a of curves. I think, uh, it was ruled that you're going to have. If you can't have a men's only club, you can't have a women's only club either, which is, that makes sense. S whatever. Who gives a fuck? Why do you want to like bother women? Like leave him alone. You don't want to think with women bothering men. You don't want to get into get into politics class and Saturdays plot is, is you can get in there, but they have all women's bodies. They're allowed to have all women's classes in places, you know, because especially when you're dealing with like exercise, some women don't want to be fucking ogled by some shithead behind them while you're doing downward dog for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:54:50       You know, that makes sense. But my point is why would you want to go where you're not wanted? You know, we're, we're not talking about like whites only or blacks only. We're talking about people that fuck, okay, when you're dealing with men and women, you're dealing with sex and we're dealing with sex. People should be allowed to get the fuck away, to have like a, like an area where no one's trying to fuck you, you know, like have like a Freebie, a base. Like I'm free here, like this is safe, this is a safe base. Like in like for a man to get upset. They're like, women want to have a place where men aren't allowed to go. Seems ridiculous. And for women to get upset, unless men are plotting women's doom behind those doors, like why would you care? Why do you want to be in that room where they only wanted to be men? Why do you want to go in there? Because they got really good steak and pipes in the case of keen can't keep that away from women forever so that, that they got

Speaker 5:          01:55:43       to go there before they got to vote because when did women get the vote?

Speaker 4:          01:55:48       That's a good point. I think the teens right? Like 1915 or something, someone was to look that one up, so teens gave in before. They're more progressive than our country was about choosing the president and some ways that steakhouse is more progressive than any other part of America. You don't want, man. I've been changing my feeling about president slightly and now I think I will only vote for a woman president because I think women should have a chance to fuck this thing up to first of all, and we should. We should be able to prove by a woman. If a woman gets an office and the exact same things happened, then we can go, okay. No one. No one really gets a say. They get in there. I think we should just run through like, all right, we got a black guy, Elizabeth Warren. To me, she seems very intelligent for a woman and that once we can establish that they're all corrupt and they all get corrupted, that everybody's corrupt or not. Maybe we'll find out that like it's a good idea to have a woman run things because women aren't more. They're not as inclined start wars, but we've already gotten the Margaret Thatcher's and whatnot. You know, I think women can get.

Speaker 5:          01:56:51       She wasn't, it was, that's not the same. It's England's completely different system. You know, it's like, I think in America there's never been a prominent political leader other than Hillary Clinton. That's a woman and she and she never really quite reached any level of, you know, I mean, she was never running things, you know what I mean? Never. She was never a governor of a major state. She was never a, you know what I mean? Like she, what she did was she married one of the greatest presidents ever went through that whole thing and now she has a job working for the president and would like to run for president, whether it's her or Elizabeth Warren or. My thinking is if every country was run by checks. Okay. How much less war and how much less. Like how much less imperialism when we have how much less money grabs, how much less it will, all the decisions to like international shit was all being done by women.

Speaker 4:          01:57:51       I'm going to go with 25 to 30 percent less now. I don't know. It'd be interesting though.

Speaker 5:          01:57:55       Seems to make sense. I mean, I'm not patronizing. I'm not bullshitting. I'm, I was, I was really thinking about this the other day. I was thinking if you look at the issues that people have when it comes to whatever the president does, so it's always two big ones. Financial. That's a big one. And military. Those are the, those are two big issues that people always have with whatever president has. And I think that women would be less likely to cause the military issues. That's just a thought. I just think there are less aggressive by nature. They're more maternal. They have this, uh, I mean they're, they're the ones who become mothers. I mean this, this idea of conquering is a very male idea,

Speaker 4:          01:58:37       don't. I don't think I'll. I think the adversarial power thing just happens.

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       If you're somebody who likes to rise in the ranks of power and it might be one of those things where it doesn't care so much about your gender may be more, but we can. We can test it out. We can try it out over the next 30 years and see what happens. I mean, obviously I don't think that it should be only women. I mean, I think that would feel if a guy came along that really made sense, but nobody makes sense. Speaking of guy stuff, I got to use the top. Yeah. All these motherfuckers, ladies and gentlemen, also known as they'll have weak bladders. That's part of why we're doing this show. I feed people coffee and I show them the weaknesses. I show them that they can hang. It can't just sit down and talk. Sometimes I'll wait around after the show's over.

Speaker 5:          01:59:19       I'll take pictures with people and then I'll pay three hours. Just doesn't seem like a long time. To me. That might be the number one flaw of this show though. There might be a time in the future where I decide the best way to do the commercials is to prerecord them and then press play and allow the guest to go and pee because it comes a point in time where I know these motherfuckers are squirming. I start seeing this shit. I start seeing this sitting up and lifting back and they're thinking, man, do I say it? No, don't be a pussy. Do I say it? No, no, no, no, no, but there's a time. Speaking of which I have to use the bathroom. They always have that moment where they're like, I said it and they go run off to the bathroom. They have to train their bladder.

Speaker 5:          02:00:05       They have to train their discipline and their desire to podcast. Right now I see a lot of people that are tapping out early, no drinking before podcasts. Just drink. Just don't be a pussy. Like I don't understand what's going on with these people and their bladders. I mean the kid had one bottle of water and a cup of coffee and it's fucking crying over there. Been maybe he's really just checking it's bitcoins. It was in that bathroom and just wants to find out what the current bit coin level is. It's like, God, what is it right now? What is it? Right. It gets up in the middle of the night, has to be checks. Is bitcoin a bill? Burr will be here tomorrow. Bill. Bill Burr has a, a new netflix special called, sorry you feel that way. It comes out this Friday, December fifth and he's one of my favorite standup comedians ever.

Speaker 5:          02:00:56       And just an awesome guy. I fucking love him. He's real estate. Get theirs. There's comedians that they become famous and they become more humble and more cool. And that's bill burr. He's a hard working motherfucker. He's always writing new shit. He was on our ice house show last Wednesday and uh, he's just one of my favorite comics period just to one of my favorite dudes. I just love talking to him and hanging out with him. He's just such a regular guy and I that, that expression like regular guys like so overused. But what I like about someone like a bill burr is that once he's become famous, what he's done is just sort of settle in, being more comfortable with themselves, very confident, but worked extra hard. He works harder now than ever before. The guy

Speaker 1:          02:01:39       is always coming up with new material. Barack Obama, right? That's who we're talking to. Bill Burr. You Fuck God Damn David Seaman. You're weak. Bladder. Is it like a little girl's fist? So your bladder, Nick. Little girl. A little stronger and bigger. It has a weakness for coffee. That's what sets it off. Well, coffee is a diuretic. It does run three too much of it's not good either. You got to be careful with the coffee people out there. They're fucking pound of that. Apparently. It's not good for the adrenals when you drink too much of it. Today we have a lovely caveman coffee blend. Single source. Quite delicious. Drinking it black. No, no butter today. I think I might be drink drinking a little too much. Butter. Coffee. So it's fucking with my voice. A little accuse me that like coats your mouth. Sometimes you're talking and it's like you're tons wrestling with slime.

Speaker 1:          02:02:31       The inside of your mouth. Slime. Do a warmup exercise before you go out and perform. Do you have to do stand standup? I stretch. So what I'd like to do to stretch, to like bend over, uh, usually with my back against the wall and nobody does anything weird and grab my ankles and pull my head in between my legs and stretch my entire spine and my hamstrings. And it gets a lot of blood flow to the brain. That helps you voice? No, no, no, no. My mouth. And I'll stretch my mouth. I just go up there and talk. It's not that hard to talk David Seaman. Not at all. You don't have to warm up for it. It's not like I'm going up there and I'm singing opera. No. True. No. Warm up a little bit. I get fired up, you know, especially if I have bits and I'm working on and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          02:03:18       I'll get into those bits. Go. I always bring a notebook so I have like a mental warmup to go over the notes. You got to do that too, like performing a lot is important, but just like some of the different aspects, you've got to perform a, you've got to read a lot. You gotta write a lot. Like right now I'm in the new new material phase, so now I'm trying to expose myself to weird shit. That's why I was watching. I've been watching a lot of documentaries and I'm just trying to not even necessarily like actively pursue new material as much as try to expose myself to a bunch of things and then ideas will come and then I sit down and write and then when I write then more ideas come. But like, I mean this just the open, open your head up and look around phase, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:04:05       Cool. You see yesterday, uh, they launched another other as supposed to launch another probe to an asteroid. Another one, Huh? This Japanese guy will have dicks all over his shirt and that'll cause a big controversy. A Japanese guy has the NASA guy of the Nasa Guy who had a, the sexy women all over his shirt and women got really upset with that. It's amazing. It's funny the things people will get outraged over and meanwhile it's like there's a constant churn of people being slaughtered and parts of the world and it's like we're going to focus twitter rage on the NASA engineer. They're all people that no one wants to fuck everyone's mad. That's what it is. If they're getting stuffed on a regular basis, they're not super sad. They're not getting laid and they have no, no weed at their apartment. So exactly their friends or not that cool and they're super into their own gender.

Speaker 1:          02:04:54       They're really into like their gender not being exploited. But if you were a chick though, seriously have to play devil's advocate and you know, you're trying to be taken seriously in science and you were really serious about women in science and then here's the fucking guy who lands a robot on a comment and he's wearing like hot chicks haulover shirt. He didn't like, what the fuck dude? Like, come on man. You can't just wear a tee shirt that says nasa on it or something like, yeah, I get your friend made. You sure I get it. I get it. I get it, but you didn't have to wear that, so I see both sides. I see. It's really stupid to get super upset. I mean there's. There are ridiculous articles that completely missed the point. The fascinating point of this comment being like the first place we've gotten a robot to land on, you know, and to have this happen in real time while these people were experiencing it, watching the monitors and everybody's going crazy to to to focus instead on the guy's shirt and did make entire articles.

Speaker 1:          02:05:56       All of your focus is on the guy's shirt. Seems very shortsighted. Very shortsighted. That's one of the things the aliens would skip us over for. They would just start laughing. They're like, these. They're just so concerned about fucking like, look, this isn't. The girls on his shirt are sexually attractive. They're much more sexually attracted in the women that are complaining about the girls shirt. Huh? That's one thing. If you look at all the twitter accounts of all the women that were really adamant about the fact this guy was an asshole for wearing that shirt. I went to their photos and I looked at all of them and I'm sure they're nice people, but if you saw them in the same outfits as those women on the shirt, you would throw up in your mouth there. They're all people that have given up on the idea of somebody being attracted to them physically, so they're not entourage extras that what you're telling me they've given up. They've. They're into science and they're not into being slender. They're not into looking good. They're into becoming more square shaped and complaining a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:07:00       Well, it's good that they have an outlet for that. Anger is hopefully it'll be a more worthy one in the future than somebody who's putting probes on a comet. I wonder if there's ever going to come a point in time where we have three types of genders. We have male, female in non. Like if we get to a point where people get to a stage of life and they just completely give up on any gender whatsoever and they assimilate into this non form. Like if that becomes an option and like people start saying, look, think about all the problems that sexual identity causes. You think about all the mis-gendering things all the times where you're supposed to think one way, but you really think another and it's very confusing and frustrating. If you were a non, you wouldn't have to worry about that. If more people became nones and recent survey, 17 percent of America said, if given the choice to have a completely nonsexual existence, they would do it. They would be really annoying though. They would be worse, not worse than the, uh, atheists on reddit. Even like, Jesus, these nones, again, they would just take up whole discussion. Third gender thing already. Whoa. A third concept that individuals are categorized. I can't read it up there at all.

Speaker 6:          02:08:25       Neither man nor woman, as well as the social category president in those societies who recognized three or more genders.

Speaker 1:          02:08:34       Well, that's an old picture too. So that means that shit's been going on for a long time.

Speaker 6:          02:08:37       Tom NFP lived as a man for many years in Germany, was photographed for this book in 1922 sexual intermediate.

Speaker 1:          02:08:46       Wow, well you know how you know the son of man living the hands. Solaris. Isn't that hilarious? Like look at her giant ass head like that's a dude head and then get down to those hands. Oh chickens, right. Look at south smaller hands are in comparison. That giant Mellon as glasses at some vintage. Warby Parker's going on. Whatever that is. Non Sex because of no one's fucking you. Okay. If you reached that point in time, you know, you're like, you're in your fifties, you're a scientist. No one's fucking, you know, you're five foot six, 200, 200, 15 pounds below square and just give given up just so you can still go to burning man. Somebody will fuck you, but you don't maybe know more. You just don't want it. Okay, cool. Done. He's just done. And you can just become a non. There's benefits because for females that they, they reach like a higher level of physical strength.

Speaker 1:          02:09:40       They get closer to man, this is the symbol for non so they can recognize each other. The international symbol. I mean, we define ourselves by our sex even when no one wants to fuck you mean that's your gender essentially. Like what is it supposed to mean mean you're a female in the wrong bathroom, you go to jail, right? That's true. Being loud, but if you're a transgender, they're trying to argue that transgender men should be able to use a men's bathrooms and transgender women should be able to use women's bathrooms even when they were born, the opposite sex and some people have an issue with that. Some people get upset at that. Yeah. It's funny how little I think about things like this. You know, if you think about like gender, like male and female once. I mean obviously you're, you can get pregnant, one can get the other pregnant and once you pass all that, once you get to this point, you're not having sex anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       Like you're in your fifties or something like that. When you, when you think about what you are like, you're thinking about it based on the fact that you have a vagina or you have a penis, but you're no longer interested in sexual intercourse. If you no longer, it doesn't sound like a burden to be defined by one or the other, like instead of just being a human, if you're not fucking see it become a non. Then you become a nun. There we go. So you take, what is this on binary? No, Google says non binary genders are gender identities that don't fit within the accepted binary of male and female people can feel they are both neither or something. See, but the problem with this is with all due respect is that this perhaps at least on some folks is a psychological issue. And I'm not talking about that.

Speaker 4:          02:11:20       I'm talking about like literally not being male or female, like building being neither being nonsexual and like if it becomes that option and they give you an option where you can walk around and you look like, like one of those gray aliens. It doesn't have genitals. Well I, I have a couple of friends who are women and if you start to treat them in a certain way, uh, they're like, what the fuck is this? You know, because they don't really fall into the female gender assumptions. Like there's still women and they do things that women do, but they don't like to be treated like anything other than what they are, which is not very feminine. Like a couple of my friends. What do you mean by don't like to be treated? There's a way that certain guys act around the women. It's kind of like a, a low level anxiety because you're seeking out their acceptance because you're like, their acceptance means that I'm sexually attractive.

Speaker 4:          02:12:11       Right? So even if they're not going to fuck you, you still want them to like you and laugh at your, your stuff and like you're trying to impress them in a way. But there are women who are like, no, like we're friends now. We're buddies. Right? You wouldn't be like this with one of your friends, so why would you be like this with me? And like interject gender into everything when I'm not doing that. Well, they're probably smart. I mean that is, it's just that is a real issue with women and men and it's gross to see when you're around your friends and then a girl comes over and you always have that one dude who like completely changes. It's about to not as pants and really interact as a human being. Yeah. Changes who he is like this fundamental. Like the motivation for his communication changes and we've all been that person before.

Speaker 4:          02:12:56       Oh yeah. It's just a matter of like. I think it's just genetics. I think it's neat that a woman is as far from one of us says you can get while still being the same species and that's not at all meant to be a sexist thing. It's just like if you look at what you are, your biology, your Oregon's a woman is having as much of a different experience as possible while still being the same exact species as you and vice versa. That's true. The male experience is different from a woman's in many ways and so it's this weird thing where instead of dividing over it, we can come together and be. That's Kinda cool. You

Speaker 5:          02:13:31       guys get to do this, this and this. We do this and I'm just kind of intrigued by it. I'm not intimidated by it. I think it's cool. You're different. You're open mind and you should get wooden beads. I should should start doing yoga and just write this in a book and sell it. You know? I think David has that one down. He's got a couple of, a couple of million copies that had to do that guy put some shit up on twitter every few months and I have to comment on. I love him. It's like just macro trolling. I can't help him because he writes shit and it's just, it's the aware system, the awareness over and over again. He's just saying Mumbo jumbo. Have you ever seen the Deepak Chopra a sentence generator? No. It's so ridiculous. You just, you, you click on it and it randomly spits out a bunch of metaphysical words, connected, you know, interconnectedness, quantum in the quantum level and it just be a console horseshit.

Speaker 5:          02:14:24       He, he's like the most ineffective complex communicator ever and I, when I told them what's really hilarious, a bunch of people were explaining to him to me what he meant and they're serious. It's like know what he means is by awareness like, Hey, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Stop what he means. You don't know what the fuck he means first of all, and you know what I mean? I mean, this is a super ineffective way of communicating. He knows and you know that that is some fucking sloppy shit. That sentence is ridiculous. It's preposterous. It's not. It's not very clear at all what he's saying. It is a bunch of fucking Mumbo jumbo. It is a bunch of word salad. There's no question about it, like if you want it to be really clear as to what you were saying, but there's part of what goes on with a lot of these spiritual type thinkers.

Speaker 5:          02:15:13       People that talk about the quantum level and all this, this weird metaphysical Mumbo jumbo talk is that keeping things mysterious is a huge part of the hustle. You have to keep things mysterious. Simplifying things is the worst thing you can do when you look at people that are trying to explain science, to really try to explain science. Look at Neil degrasse Tyson's twitter feed and you'll see a guy who explains things very clearly. You never read a Neil degrasse Tyson tweet and go, what the fuck did he mean by that? It's real clear. What do you mean? You know why? Because he's an awesome communicator. What are you showing up there, buddy? What do you, what do you got here? Oh, the chopra thing. Oh, but we can't see that. I bet. No, I'm, I'm seeing it on the scrambler. What is he doing? I don't even know what's happening.

Speaker 5:          02:16:02       We're talking and there's a video in the same time. Um, I did like one of his books back in the day though. The, a seven spiritual laws of success. He's got some good ideas. Quantum physics unfolds into total acceptance of neural networks. Oh, is this one of the generators, the generator and the Higgs Boson fears species specific opportunities? Yeah. These seem totally real. They seem totally real, but that's what he's doing. I mean, this is exactly what he's doing. He's a bunch of shit and some of it, I mean you can kind of interpret it if you like, into some sort of a, a valid sentence, but the reality is he's really super ineffective with how he forms these sentences and the con, the thoughts that are being conveyed. Whereas if you go to Neil degrasse Tyson's twitter feed, it's super obvious what he's saying really obvious and I'm like, I might say I'm an idiot, I'm Kinda dumb, but I'm not dumb enough that I don't know when you're being a fucking idiot, you know, I know what you're doing.

Speaker 5:          02:16:59       You're just splashing a bunch of words together and trying to pretend like this is some deep sentence. This is poorly thought out shit. And people gobble it up because they love it. They love that. That whole, the whole package, the brown skin, the Indian background, the whole deal. Please Swami, please Kumaré. Teach me the way you see that documentary. No, I haven't seen it, but I know it's unethical. It was awesome. It's a great premise. Go around as a fake. It's sad though when the people were like super into him, you know, it's sad. They're crying that he's actually there with them and you realize he's that he actually is having this positive effect on these people because they're so lost. They're like, really need him to be that guy. People really do you know, want that one person to be so connected. They don't realize that what you should be seeking is your own.

Speaker 5:          02:17:51       Instead of seeking like this one person who's going to be your guru is going to show you the way. Seek your own experiences, seek your own enlightening moments, whether it's through yoga, through meditation, sensory deprivation tank, psychedelic study, whether it's through fucking hiking and thinking, just being alone by yourself, whether it's through writing, whether it's through exploring ideas, whatever the fuck it is, seek your own answers to stuff, but the idea that you're going to come across this one master that hasn't nailed the, throw that away, throw that away. If you meet the Buddha in the road, kill him. I mean, that's, that's the old expression that said, throw that shit away. Like you don't. Don't want to find a fucking master because they don't exist. You're going to get roped into. You might find people that are beautiful, that have an incredible grasp of reality, but as soon as they start pushing themselves as a master run that somebody's trying to sell you a book, someone trying to tell you that they get it.

Speaker 5:          02:18:57       Watch decoding depok ever see the fucking documentary his own son made his son, made a documentary on him, clowning him where he catches a meditating and he's. He's like, I'm going to go meditate, and he catches them snoring. Videotapes that, these splices that altogether showing it and it makes him look so ridiculous. And to Deepak's credit, he actually went on opiod anthony with his son and talked about like, you know that he's, you know, he's just a normal person. He says who he is and his son made a documentary about him but his sunrail he clowned him in this documentary. I'll have to check that out. Oh my God. You have to see it. You should eat. At least watch the trailer. It's just, it's so ridiculous. It's his son, like really clowned him and just makes you realize like what it must have been like to grow up with this guy as your dad, like spouting his son is very smart to the sun was on Opie and anthony with them and you kind of sense first of all a that he really does love his dad, his dad, he knows his dad is not a terrible person, but you could sense the sort of frustration and you know, the difference between like whose dad actually is and like this menopausal misconception that these, you know, it's a lot of lost women and older men.

Speaker 5:          02:20:07       I mean I say menopausal male menopause as well. Like there's older people searching, searching for spirituality that stumble on the bookstore. They find work stack of his books. Yeah, well I've always been metaphysical at heart. You know, people are always searching for this, like really deep hidden meaning. But what's really interesting to me is I don't see that in psychedelic circles. One thing that I don't see in psychedelic circles is the acceptance of Gurus. Like that's one of the last places where I got like deep pockets going to thrive because, you know, when you talked to him about Lsd, I could achieve these states with my own mind.

Speaker 4:          02:20:44       No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't. You know, I don't think you can. And if you can, if you think you can, it's most likely because you haven't been there already. You know, if you can achieve dmt without DMT, with, you're a better man than most. Some special creature that's studied Kundalini Yoga for 10 years and locked herself in a fucking monastery. Terence Mckenna, I believe, said that LSD was like the most significant molecule of the 20th century. And so, you know, you can give that to somebody. Uh, if you go on youtube, you can search for LSD, housewife, 19 fifties. Oh yeah, I remember that. That's an amazing. It's an amazing video because this is a woman who, if you were told you were about to be given LSD, at least you would know it's about to hit you. But this is a fucking housewife.

Speaker 4:          02:21:27       It's just been sent there to do this experiment and he gives her a glass of water. He's like, here you go, ma'am. Here's your Lsd, and it just hits her and you see this transformation. It's like you're as one of my friends put it. It's like you're watching the sixties on unfold. You're watching the 19 fifties transform into the sixties to this one woman through this one woman and her one LSD experience and a Steve Jobs. Actually in that biography, there's, like I said earlier, there's a lot of stuff like he called his era when he grew up, a magical time because everybody was under the influence of psychedelics. Well, that was the big shift between the fifties and the sixties without a doubt, and then the seventies, the lock it all down.

Speaker 5:          02:22:06       Well, that's what happened. They did. They pass those sweeping, the sweeping psychedelics bill, 1970. That made. They made a bunch of stuff illegal. That wasn't even psychologic or it wasn't even a psychoactive. Like there's. There's different compounds that they made illegal that they don't even affect the human mind. They just. They're just locking everything down so they're doing stuff without real science behind it. They're not going after the dangerous compounds. They're just going after anything that might alter consciousness in a way that threatens the powers that be, and that's where they were at. They were at this, we're in this weird place where the world had changed so much in 10 years. They were terrified as to what the fuck was coming. The next 10. They saw these flower power people and all this fucking give peace, a chance, all that shit. And they were like, what is going on here? This, this never even existed in the 19 forties when I was growing up. Here we are in the 19 sixties. These God damn hippies and walk them through Kent State trying to stop the war.

Speaker 3:          02:23:06       What's really kind of scary to think about is thinking about how they locked all that stuff down. People think it's bad because of the conditioning. You know? It's like you don't want to do acid. You don't want to do weed. You don't want to do any of these bad sounding things that make you seem like you're kind of on the fringes of society. So only the people who are on the fringes of society start doing these things and you no longer have the captains of industry like steve jobs experimenting with this stuff and as a result you don't have as much inspiring change. You know, like we've kind of been caught in a Rut up until very recently until that whole, the whole like Bitcoin Wiki leaks type era. We were in a span of eight or nine years where it's like very little personal freedom, very little dissent or discussion of what's happening. They're moving. So I really think so. I think after nine slash 11, pretty much society went, if it's not for survival, we're going to put it on the back burner. So we were still doing other stuff, but now finally we're getting that explosion of creativity and experimentation that we were supposed to get probably 10 years ago. And bitcoin is one of those things and like real independent media, like your show is another one and they're all blossoming.

Speaker 5:          02:24:15       I think it was all inevitable. I really do. I mean, I think and I think quite honestly more people are probably doing psychedelic drugs now than have ever before, including in the 1970 [inaudible], the 19 sixties. I think the numbers are through the roof. I think we are caught up in the middle of it, so we're not totally aware of what's going on, but if you include marijuana and I definitely do when it comes to eating marijuana, I consider eating marijuana a psychedelic truck. I really do. And I think that people who don't, they probably, they're just probably not eating the stuff were eating, you know, the shit that you're getting out of here, like the gummies,

Speaker 3:          02:24:49       the inception moments where you just don't feel the same about something again

Speaker 5:          02:24:52       ever again. Yeah. Yeah. Including the very fiber of reality itself. These God damn things are so powerful and the experience is just not the same as smoking it. It's way more significant. It's way deeper and weirder. It's just, it's a different truck when you eat it and it's responsible for a lot of like ancient Hindu religious art and religious scriptures. A lot of that stuff was being done while they were eating. Has She? She. I mean that was, that was the, the preferred method of delivery cannabis for a long time was eating it.

Speaker 4:          02:25:26       I think there's, I think there's a religious high day, a high day in India where they just smoke all day long to like get in touch with the goddess. One of the goddesses. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:25:36       I'm sure. I'm sure there's a lot of religions are like, that seeks. There's certain sex of Sikhs. They eat this yogurt. They were explaining it to Duncan and he was explaining it to me, so I apologize from fucking something up. But there's some yogurt yogurt that has marijuana in it. Yeah. Like the marijuana infused honey or something like that. And they mix it in this yogurt and get fucking.

Speaker 7:          02:25:57       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:25:59       Blasted. And these dudes were explaining it to Duncan, like how important it is to them. Sikhs or uh, an interesting race of people or religious, a group. They get connected to a lot of, you know, ignorantly to like Muslims and Islamic people, like the people to see things with. People see things on people's heads and they thing they're all the same folks know, but ancient religions that had their roots in psychedelics, there's still a lot of them that are around are still a lot of them that exist. There's a lot of evidence that shows that it's shaped a lot of thinking way, way, way back in the day and if you want to get on the that mindset, get into the groove that those people must have been in when they were doing that. If you eat hash and think about what it must've been like to live 300 years ago, I mean you pretty much put yourself in a state of mind where you can kind of think the way they were thinking a little bit mean. You can never erase the information that you have, but imagine what it would be like to live two, 3000 years ago and to be eating hash and hanging out in India and just tripping your fucking balls off on this big round ball. Spinning around in space.

Speaker 5:          02:27:14       Illegal. Yeah. I mean I think there's more people doing that now. There's more people eating marijuana now than probably ever before. I think that's pretty safe to say. The numbers are just staggering. You know, the numbers that are, that are

Speaker 4:          02:27:27       22 states and the, uh, the territory of Guam now have some kind of legalization, so really, or medical marijuana laws, Washington DC's are going to be a weird one. I don't know when that goes into effect, but that passed recently. That's going to be weird for sure because you can have congressional aides go home for lunch hypothetically. Get high legally come back. They'll be tested even if it's still not federally legal, which is hilarious because that's where the federal government's offices are. So the very state where their offices are in Washington DC. Well, the federal government more than anything else that likes money and this is one of the most obvious money grabs. It's like, why wouldn't you, you know, we're cutting out all of these where the money goes south to the cartels. If we can keep all that in the United States, that's a fuck load of money. Yeah. That's one way of looking at it and not just that, but also small business opportunities. Not a lot of startup costs.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       Pretty easy to fucking start your own small business selling weed. I'm pretty easy to grow it if people start transferring that to the, uh, using it as a commodity, like the hamp movement that we were talking about with clothes and paper and building materials and all those things start happening. If that becomes legal, it will literally transform this entire country when people find out how easy it is for farmers to grow hemp and profit off of it. And we're not talking at all about drugs, nothing to do with the drug. Right now. It's only legal in a couple states to grow hamp and manufacturer hamp. And as far as I know, it's still not like no one's really going for it. No big companies are moving in giving it a shot because it's still federally illegal, which is weird because not even psychoactive. Let's have a cousin of the psychoactive strain of marijuana and still illegal.

Speaker 1:          02:29:16       It's a, it's going to end. There's no doubt unless something happens. The only thing that could put the genie back in the bottle, it would have to be some sort of a cataclysmic event, whether it's a, some nuclear bomb goes off or something where they have to completely 19, 84. This motherfucker tighten down the screws and cut, cut off the internet, filter everything. No more drugs, no more anything. I mean they're gonna. It would have to be something like really huge, something really huge and scary and even then it might not work. Even then people might be like, you know what the reason why this fucking nuclear should happen in the first place because we were listening to you assholes. Yeah. I think that that's more likely is if there was some calamity. A lot of people just feel like we're going to go do our own thing.

Speaker 1:          02:30:03       What do you think of all this ferguson protests? Do you think that this is just because of Ferguson just because that decision or do you think that this is like a sign that people are ready to start fucking protesting shit because I'm more inclined to believe the latter? I think there's a lot of resentment in the United States over the fact that for many of us, it's hard to find honest work, but if you decide to go into law enforcement, you can suddenly make you a comfortable $50,000 a year and some places just feeding the prison system, innocent people and that sounds like some kind of tree hugger thing, but if you look at the math, that's actually what a lot of these police departments are doing is sending poor disadvantaged people. Most of the minorities into prison for a owning things that I don't consider it to be harmful to society.

Speaker 1:          02:30:49       You know, I just don't consider marijuana to be harmful. And even some of the harder drugs that people get busted on, it's like, well that's. They're literally their only opportunity, but that's not what we're talking about here. We're talking about police brutality, but it has nothing to do with distrust, I believe is connected to the fact that they can't trust these police officers because they can ruin your life if they want to over something very arbitrary. So I think that's the backdrop for it. And then, I don't know all the specifics of Ferguson, but based on what I saw, that grand jury thing there should a trial like there are too

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       many inconsistencies. The whole point of a public trial is to figure out what happened and if you're a police officer and that means somehow you're treated differently. That to me doesn't add up. Well, I think that when you're dealing with police brutality, there's a lot better examples than this one. There's a lot of examples. There are absolutely fucking horrific that you could find on youtube. You can find them everyday. There's some kid that got tasered. He was in his girlfriend's car. Cop tasered him hit him in near the heart. He felt it's a white kid, fell face planted, stopped breathing, went into cardiac arrest. They didn't revive him for like three minutes. He might have brain damage because this kid did nothing, did nothing wrong. It's just sitting in a car. And the cop told him, roll the window down. Apparently the window didn't roll down.

Speaker 5:          02:32:04       Cop fucking tasered him. I mean, I obviously I wasn't there, but like they show this kid on the ground and the complex standing over, I'm not doing shit. There's a whole video of it. How about the guy who was in Denver was beating the shit out of this guy they had on the ground because he said he had a bag in his mouth. So he's punching him in the face while he's holding him down. His pregnant wife comes over to try to stop them. They trip his wife, she falls on the ground. You're watching this. You're like, what? Then they tried to erase the video, but the guy that already uploaded it to the cloud and they released it and showed it on television and there's a whole lot of fucking really horrible shit that cops do. This is, this is the homepage of reddit every day.

Speaker 5:          02:32:41       It's like you see at least one or two stories that make your, make your heart stop and. But like many things in this life where you would like things to be completely black and white, and the thing that people gravitate towards turns out to be a massive string of contradictions. There's a lot of things wrong with this case. The first of all, the guy, first of all, he was young. He was 18 years old. Hard to say. He's responsible for all of his behavior at 18 years of age. When you think about what kind of a life this kids live in, what kind of an environment he's grown up in. But all that said, he's robbing a store. Just moments before this video of him grabbing this guy by the neck. He's a fucking huge guy. Reaches into the cop's car, punches him in the face, is trying to get the cops gun, gets shot in the hand at close range.

Speaker 5:          02:33:30       All this has been proven. So you're. You're dealing with a dangerous bad guy already for sure. Has that much been proven? Yes. So we know that he actually, we know he robbed that store. We know he punched the cop. We know we tried to get the cops gun. We know the gun discharged, he shot him in the hand at very close range. Well then that if that's the case, that doesn't strike me as being the best example, but it's a bad exam. Still falls under the range of like, well, did you have to end somebody's life or could you have just tackled him? Well, he couldn't tackle them. First of all, he was not physically capable of beating that kid up or hazed. Well, you know, I don't think. I don't think he had a taser on him, but I think that was part of his thing and he couldn't discharge pepper spray because he was in the car and the guy's punched him in the face and he was worried he was gonna lose consciousness and it's a big fucking kid.

Speaker 5:          02:34:15       So there's better examples. I don't know what the fuck happened in the moments before that guy's life was taken and there's contradicting stories. There's people that say that he had his hands up, those people that say he was charging, you know when you have that. I don't know what the fucking tell you. I mean, I don't understand people that claim they do know. When you look at the autopsy, the autopsy statements apparently tend to tend to exonerate the cop, the autopsy, the descriptions of the bullet wounds are supposedly, from what I've read, obviously I'm not a forensic scientist or anything, but they seemed to indicate this. The cop story was a little bit more kosher that he had a shot on the top of his head, which he indicated was charging towards him, shot through his arm in a way that you couldn't possibly do if the guy's arms are up in the air. Like everybody's saying, I don't know. I don't know what the fuck happened. There's people that say they saw him with his hands up. Then the other thing that's a real problem is witness testimony. People see things that aren't really there.

Speaker 3:          02:35:17       One, one of the women on the grand jury, the AP story said that, uh, she has racist views, has trouble differentiating between truth and things. She is read online, and this is actually in the AP report. You're like, well, if this is a person, he's one of your witnesses. That's pretty flimsy witness right there. You know,

Speaker 5:          02:35:35       there's an interesting radio lab story this month, this week rather. Radio lab is a really interesting podcast that I listened to and this one is about a, I think it was in Mumbai or Kenya, I forget what part of Africa it was, but there was a terrorist attack on a mall and these guys showed up with guns and they shot a bunch of people and there was all these different eyewitness testimonies that were just. It was hard to figure out who's telling the truth. There was 15 gunman. There was 10 gunman. Well, they did a forensic examination of all of the video footage from all the surveillance cameras and turns out there, four gunman and they were all killed and these people had these different descriptions and they like swore they saw this and they swore they saw that. But when you go over all the video footage from all the people entering, all the people leaving, all the they.

Speaker 5:          02:36:31       They have this pretty accurate based on like real hard evidence. They've got a 24 hour camera system going all the time. They captured all of it and they spent hours and hours going over all the events and finding out who's the WHO's the shooter. I mean they have a. They have a grid of the entire place so they know what happened, but yet people have all these different descriptions of young people, of older people, people taking off their clothes and assimilating into society. They drop their gun and change their clothes and they they, they escaped like a normal person and that became a narrative and there was a lot of people that believe these stories, but when they describe the actual events that they've captured on video to these people, they don't want to it. They don't want to admit what what is actually on video you could see happening.

Speaker 5:          02:37:19       That's not what I saw. That's not what I saw, but it's all right there. People see things, especially under stress, stressful situation, a murder taking place and attack on a police officer. Guns are going off. Oh my God, the guy got shot. Did you see what happened? I saw it. He had his hands up. He had his hands up. I saw him too. He had his hands up and then people start repeating it, hands up, don't shoot like, okay. He had his hands up. I don't know if he had his hands up. He might've had his hands up, but to say, you know, he didn't have his hands up or to say, you know, he had his hands up. It's fucking crazy. Unless you were there and if you were there, man, I wouldn't have to. I say I'd have to know. You need this body camera stuff is going to solve a lot of problems.

Speaker 5:          02:37:57       Yeah. We'll find an honest cop. That should be the first thing you want because it means your liabilities now dropping the close to zero. If you, if you take somebody's life and it turns out it was justified or you use, you know, use of force and you need to. Any jury is going to look at that and go, well you're a cop and you're protecting the public and a story. No doubt. And I think ultimately that's going to be the great response to all this shit. All these horrible situations, like the 12 year old kid that was killed with the fake gun that was just walking on the street, the cops pull up within two seconds of getting out of their car. This kid's dead. They get out of the car, they just start shooting them, you know, and the nine one one call says it looks like he's got a fake gun.

Speaker 5:          02:38:37       The nine one one call says that. I mean, I don't know what the fuck information gets the actual cops itself, you know, the nine slash 11 operator calls the cops and say, Hey, there's a guy with a gun. I don't know what the fuck was actually said, but there's a lot of those situations and a lot of those situations just simply wouldn't take place the same way if everyone was wearing cameras. They just wouldn't, they wouldn't. There'd be accountability. I mean cameras on cops. That's like the Internet of law enforcement, you know? That's really what it is. It's like full accountability, full access to information and if those fucking things are streaming, first of all, what an amazing show that would be. He'd build a watch cops lives like all day long and just stream into officer Wilson's camera. The Truman show meets cops like you think about that.

Speaker 5:          02:39:24       Like guys in Compton, like like working the beat in Inglewood, you know, at night doing drug law enforcement or narcotics. What'll happen is within a few years you'll be watching it and one of the cops will take down some meth dealer and you'll be like, good job. The qr code will pop up on the screen. Everybody will send him like a little bit of Bitcoin. That cop will be set for the year and it'll become this thing where it's like you want to be a really fair cop because everybody's watching the streams for fun and providing tips to the cops that are not corrupt. The monetary 10 he'd be right. I mean this has maybe like a one percent chance of happening, but I think it'd be cool. Well, one thing that would be cool as you would know, like cops that are cool you would know like who gets people you know, gives people fair deals and communicates with people well and doesn't, doesn't abuse his power.

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       Well, I will say like every interaction I've had with a cop in California has been positive and I think part of that is it in the back of my brain. I'm not like, oh, this guy could fuck me over if you wanted to because I had weed in my car. Now it's like, well I'm doing everything that's legal and he's doing his stuff and like, cool, you know,

Speaker 5:          02:40:31       and you're white and um, white, white.

Speaker 3:          02:40:37       Not at all denying the a racialist white privilege, the racial profiling that happens with cops. But all I'm saying is living in a state where I'm not treated like a criminal for doing things that as an adult I feel I should be entitled to do that. Or you know, in my own, just an antidepressant basically. Why shouldn't I be allowed to do that? The cops here, we agree it's none of our business and that to me is a sign of respect, so I respect them. Well, cops in California definitely have a different take on it, but it's come a long way. You know, I have a buddy of mine is a cop like years ago would joke around about how he doesn't care.

Speaker 5:          02:41:10       Marijuana was still fucking arrest them. Why? What's wrong with you? But they, you know, they get into that US versus them mentality I think. I don't think we realized how difficult it is to be a cop. I think fucking unbelievably hard jobs. And you're the scum of the earth like sometimes part of the time. Yeah. Well you're, you're also dealing with incredible amounts of pressure. You're dealing with incredible amounts of, of, of violent input. You're seeing things that you can't unsee it and you're looking at people in a completely different way if you work in a nightclub. Okay. Like say if your only interaction with people's. You're a bartender and nightclub, you would think that everybody is a drunk asshole. Just maniacs. You know, if you're a woman who has to wear like a short leather skirt and show up at a fucking honky tonk bar and delivered drinks, your opinion of men is going to be based on drunks that you see at night in the dark who are grabbing ass, act like assholes and spilling shit on themselves and then driving home drunk.

Speaker 5:          02:42:10       He'd be like, Oh, they're disgusting. But if you were a chick who worked the front desk at a yoga place, you might meet like really cool, peaceful people. You know. It's all about the environment that you find yourself in. And if you're, you're in the environment of being a police officer. Most of what you're dealing with all day is people that are breaking the law and conflict and people running away and fuck man, that, that job is fucking hard. It's hard. I mean, you don't just start punching immigrants in the face on your first day. You know, you don't like tackle a guy and start punched in the face because you got a heroin bag in his mouth. That's like years and years of stress and and build up and just fucking craziness had barely keeping it together and who knows what you're on. Who knows if you're on antidepressants or anti this or pro that or adderall.

Speaker 5:          02:43:05       A lot of them take adderall to try to stay awake and stay sharp and provigils a big one. The cops are taking that new vigil and pro vigil. A lot of police officers like that shit because it keeps them sharp and a lot of them are on steroids. Lot of on steroids now. I don't think they're doing a lot of tests for steroids and the fucking police department. I saw this dude pull this guy over the other day. He was Jack, Jack, Jack State troopers here. Don't fuck around so big. The guy was so jacked. He was. He was that level of jacked where you just don't get there without drugs, just like arms are like three times as big as mine. Giant ass fucking neck. It was huge. It was huge and I was like, this guy is a drug user. He's a drug user and he's using illegal drugs and he's pulling people over like unless he's doing testosterone replacement therapy and just like, at the very least he's abusing his levels. I mean, the guy's gigantic. It's so preposterous. Leave large. That's a cop. Nobody, nobody has a problem with that big ass fucking arms and its sleeve. Nobody has a problem. That's okay. That's okay because it got a roach in your fucking car salesman get out of the car, son.

Speaker 3:          02:44:14       That's what I'm talking about. Like it's that, that kind of, uh, that uh, opposition just puts you in a kind of freaked out mode. Yeah. Yeah, it does. Even in New York, which most of us can we consider New York to be a civilized city. It's like the cultural capital of the US in some ways. If you're black, the stop and frisk thing, that's an expensive, like unpleasant process. I believe that discontinued that. I think they will. Um, wasn't a ruled unconstitutional. I don't 100 percent know what the status of that is. We'll pull up stop and frisk, but that went on for years and that was complete bullshit. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:44:52       Yeah, um, stop and Frisk, um, mayor says New York City will settle suits on stop and frisk.

Speaker 8:          02:45:05       Hm.

Speaker 5:          02:45:08       Stop and Frisk. Appeal is on hold. Okay. This is the latest here. New York City ends, legal, defensive stop and Frisk. So apparently they just. So they had dropped the appeal. Okay. So what it is is apparently there's like so much, so many lawsuits and so much bullshit attached to it that they're probably doing it for financial reasons.

Speaker 3:          02:45:29       Well, that's like California. We're letting go of the, uh, nonviolent drug offenders, right? That proposition that passed. Yeah. That's the money move to. That has nothing to do with morality. It's like we don't have the money to fucking spend $60,000 for every single person we lock up. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:45:46       The New York City, they're, they're saying mayor Bloomberg's administration has sought the appeal to appeal Judge Korea Shin, the Lynn Lynn's ruling, which stated that the New York City Police Department had abused its power, but a de Blasio is working to settle the case out of court. We believe these steps will make everyone safer. Blasio told

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       New York Brooklyn news conference, this will be one city where everyone rises together where everyone's rights are protected. Okay, sure. What that means. Everyone rises together. So his cane, he campaigned, the new mayor, mayor de blasio campaigned on a promise to end the era of stop and Frisk. Policing. Yeah, I mean it's gross. It's gross in. Especially if you're a young black guy. It's horseshit or young. I mean, I don't know if women are getting harassed as much. They're saying men, they're saying young African American and Latino men in specific. It's horrible to be treated as a criminal. You're not doing anything wrong. Yeah. That's gross. Well, about the guy that was walking there was just putting his hands in his pockets and this is a. that's where we're at. That's our world. No judging people based on how many, how much melanin, what, what part of the world your parents might have immigrated from.

Speaker 1:          02:47:04       That's part. That's part of the world. No, we have a big part of the country where you can, at least in Colorado, just walk into a gift shop and get what you need to feel happy and nobody's gonna racially profile you and fuck up your life and that's awesome. You know, we should have more stuff like that. But in Colorado that's where that fucking. I got beaten up. Denver Police Department beat the fuck out of that guy. What a heroin bag in his mouth, so they'll just escalating other drugs. Is that the thing now? Now it's going to be like, well, if you have any of these, we're really going to come after you, but this one's okay. Maybe mean. What do they do? If they have drug quotas, that's the real issue. Because of a department had quotas on arrests and some of them do and they're very controversial.

Speaker 1:          02:47:45       There's quotas on speeding tickets as quotas and all sorts of things that cops are told they have to reach. I've always wondered what the fuck happens. If no one commits a crime, what happens if we all agree like, hey everybody, can we all keep it together for six months? Because if everybody can keep it together for six months and we all make a pact that no one speeds, no one litters, no one does anything. The cops can arrest you for. No one breaks a law for six months. What the fuck did the cops do? Like what do we do? Does. I mean if we can do that for a day, if we could use just fred day police departments across the United States would fucking panic. We nail arrested as to create new laws. If you're an oxygen smuggler, you breathe too much oxygen, we got to take you down.

Speaker 1:          02:48:27       Well, you know what they would likely do? They'd probably likely get people to conspire to do something. They would go undercover and then create crime and arrest people for agreeing with them. Like, we're going to go rob that bank. I guarantee you we could make some money. Yeah, man, you want to rob that bank makes money. I'm in. As long as you're show, we can make some money. I'm sure we can make some money. And they set it all up and then the. All right, everybody put your hands up. You're going to rob this bank, use your fucking idea, man. Like that right now is legal and that right now is how they bust people for drugs. They do it all the time. They bust people for drugs where they have fake drug deals, where they put people in jail for significant amounts of time for drugs that never existed. They thought

Speaker 5:          02:49:08       they were going to buy and sell these drugs. They get them on conspiracy to buy and sell drugs. They believe they're real drugs, but the drugs are just a fiction of the dea is imagination and a big part of the theater that's been put on. They do it with terrorism. That mentally challenged guy that they arrested a few years back in Dallas was a perfect example that they gave this guy a fake bomb. Set it up, convinced him that you're gonna, take this bomb and you're going to fucking blow this building up and the name of a law and they got this mentally challenged guy, set him up, got him to do it, talked him into it, gave him the fake bomb, and then when he went to detonate it, they arrested him.

Speaker 3:          02:49:45       But to play, play devil's advocate to play a national security state advocate and be the homelands type character. That kind of person who that dumb or that easily influenced, they're going to bounce around and come up against something ugly at some point. So yeah, I mean there's, there's a fine line with entrapment. Like I think that they should be doing some of those undercover sting things because that's how you find out who is the bad guy. And like any normal person would be like, no, I'm good. I'm not going to take the bombs and go do the thing. Right. That's like, that's the choice the person makes. And uh, that's one of those areas where I think some of it is going over the line, but I think they have to do that too.

Speaker 5:          02:50:24       Well, I think the idea of the wounded antelope, it's better to take them out quickly before the crocodiles get them at the waterhole. There's some merit to that.

Speaker 3:          02:50:34       Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Like, this is a dumb guy whose mind is fertile for radicalism, know it's better to get the fake radicalism than the real thing,

Speaker 5:          02:50:42       or figure out a way to let this poor bastard no, that he's stupid and don't listen to everybody because they're going to try to get you to blow up a building and they gonna lock you in a fucking cage. I mean that guy right now than a jail somewhere. And he probably will remain that chill for a long fucking time and there's not a lot of recourse. And he probably was super excited about this new thing that he was involved in because finally his life had some meaning because without that and without this spiritual connection to this jihad that he was about to commit, like what kind of a connection did he have to his own existence? I mean, he might've been dancing through life completely aimlessly, always depressed, always sad, and then all of a sudden he's a part of something exciting, right? They call them his brothers and all have shit already.

Speaker 5:          02:51:27       Oh, I mean, you know, one thing that I've recognized that I'm not, obviously I'm not a religious person, but one thing that I do recognize when I watch me and even religions that have no experience in it all, like Islamic mosques, when they're, they're giving these speeches and they're talking about the value of Islam that Islam as the truth and everybody's, you know, agreeing and you know, saying, you know, I'll, I'll walk by. They're all like yelling it out. And there's, there's this feeling of camaraderie that's very attractive about that. Even if you know what's bullshit, even if you know it doesn't make any sense, even if it's scientology, even if it's, you know, mormonism, whenever you got a big group of people that agree on something and they're all like, fucking completely committed to it, you're like, oh, I want to be in with those guys.

Speaker 5:          02:52:13       Like there's a part of you that wants to be in that group because there's a lot of energy in that group. They're committed to it, you know, they're all saying the same old ancient shit. Allah walk chanting it together. Like there's power in that. You know, why? Because Islam is the truth and everybody claps and you see that, that, that, the draw of that, like it's, it's tangible to me. I'm not joining. I don't want to join, but I would be lying if I said that I didn't see the appeal of the comradery of any sort of a group that you're absolutely committed to.

Speaker 3:          02:52:48       I think there's something really attractive, attractive about being the person to stand back and be like, wait a second, this is all fucking shit. You know what I mean? Oh, there's definitely that, like there's definitely, that'd be the person in the Middle East who has, you know, twitter on your phone and Google News and you can see the limitations of being fed this angry radicalism based on some stuff that happened a thousand years ago and use that too. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:53:15       does that too. But what I'm saying is the opposite of that. What I'm saying is that I see the appeal of joining these organizations. We want to be a part of it.

Speaker 3:          02:53:22       Clam. Have you seen the most wanted man? No. What's that? It was a Philip Seymour Hoffman, his last movie, I just saw it recently. It was a good, it was good. It's like a slow, realistic version of a homeland episode so that they're in Hamburg, Germany and he's this counterterrorism spy and they're tracking these a Muslim radicals through Hamburg and trying to build a case against one of them and so it really is like you see them more maybe realistic or maybe less glamorous side of counterterrorism and it's like, at least based on this movie, it's a lot of hanging around mosques and trying to figure out who the bad guys are. Yeah. I would imagine there's a lot of that if you're trying to infiltrate, if you're really trying to become a part of their movement, but anyway, point is it's a really good movie and it gets you to see like just how fucked it is that these young guys get into these mosques and stuff and then become influenced by charismatic personalities and can do a lot of damage and it's the

Speaker 5:          02:54:21       pattern that's been established. The pattern that's been established was one of violence, suicide bombings and you know, when that pattern becomes established, that's what people sort of accept. If that was that existed in Christianity, Christianity was overwhelmed with suicide bombings and you know you and people really believe they're going to heaven, they blew themselves up in a marketplace. You'd you'd see similar behavior. It's a human pattern. It's when these patterns get established, it's very difficult to break them off and it's. It's weird how some get established, but they're not logical like human patterns can be completely illogical. Human patterns can involve cutting holes in your lips and putting plates in them and stretching them out. That's a a human pattern that somehow or another got adopted and the size of the plate became directly proportionate to the amount of cows you're worth when you get married.

Speaker 5:          02:55:12       That's so unlikely. If you saw that on paper, if somebody proposed that as an episode of a television show, that there's these people that we run into and there are a tribe and they have a plate. They stick in their lives. Why would they put a plate? No Lip? Well, because the bigger the plate, the more cows there'll be worth when they get married. The Fuck Outta here. That's a stupid plot point. People wouldn't even agree with, they would say that's a dumb idea for a show, but meanwhile that is a very real thing. I mean, those people exist. There's many photos of them. They knock out their lower teeth, the plates fit in better. It's fucking ridiculous. So patterns don't have to be logical. They just have to exists and people slip right into him. You know the, we've talked about this before, but the semen people of New Guinea where they force young boys to ingest their semen because it's going to make them grow stronger and healthier.

Speaker 5:          02:56:00       They call themselves the semen warriors. Do they really? Oh Dude, it's the most lookup semen warriors of New Guinea. It is one of the strangest fucking places in the world and you're talking about thousands of people, thousands of people that do this. They take the sun from the mom at an early age and the, the, the, the new male companion, whatever it is, starts but fucking them in mouth. Fuck him. And that's how they, they tell them they have to do this in order for them to grow strong. I mean, it's fucking crazy and that's a pattern. That pattern is just, it exists and it exists in a strange place, but it's there. They're isolated and you can study them and people have gone in there and examine their culture enough that they write on it and they have in detailed descriptions from people that have gone through it.

Speaker 5:          02:56:52       It's nuts. That does sound extremely naughty. It's people are fucking crazy. David Seaman. Crazy as fuck. That's why we got to get people a upgraded. Get them on bitcoin. Do you in this fucking Bitcoin, you're making me anti bitcoin. One bitcoin out of your fucking mouth. That's your solution for everything. Bitcoin. Mushrooms in Bitcoin. That's what you should sell a t shirt on. David Seaman. Dotcom. Mushrooms in Bitcoin and bitcoin. Yeah. Speaking of mushrooms the other day, the New York Times, the home page of the New York Times had an op Ed on mushrooms like very forward thinking shit, and millions of people are reading that. If it's on the New York Times. Yeah. Things are changing while they're being forced to catch up. The Internet is, you know, Johns Hopkins University, we publish that study many years ago, the one about people that were taking psilocybin and had their lives changed for the better permanently. There's been Mtma studies that had been released, so there's a lot of studies. It's like they're being forced to. The were overwhelming amount of information that's coming out there are being forced to address it now in mainstream publications. The CNN piece Iowasca Sanjay Gupta's pieces and is complete 180 degree turnaround on marijuana.

Speaker 3:          02:58:05       What's weird is when people who are critics go, well, you're not really connecting to some like global universal mind. You're just done. You're just ingesting the substance that allows the two hemispheres of your mind to communicate better. And if I go, if that's the case, why aren't I allowed to use that? Right? If it's something that's, it's improving my cognitive ability or improving my mind's ability to figure, figure out, you know, deep seated challenges, what's wrong with that?

Speaker 5:          02:58:31       There's nothing wrong with it. This isn't. There's no bodies and people aren't dying of mushrooms and on top of that, the people that say you're not doing this, you're just doing that. Unless you have personal experience in, in like heavy duty, breakthrough level, psychedelic experiences. Unless you have one of those under your belt, you really don't know what you're talking about. You, you're, you're guessing on what it's like and what it's like is so far beyond the capabilities of your imagination that this is a ridiculous conversation. Is like a blind person trying to describe to you what the universe looks like and like you're like, oh, okay. Well that's what it looks like to you and you can't say you can. When you get your eyes fixed. Come to me and I'll explain to you why I know what blue looks like.
