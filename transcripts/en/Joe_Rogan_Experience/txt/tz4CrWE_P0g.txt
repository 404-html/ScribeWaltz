Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Huh

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       that quickly to one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:06       Boom. And we're alive. Mr Polin, how are you? Pay Good. Good to be here this two way. There you go. Okay. What's happening man? How are you? Good. Good to be in la. Uh, good to have you here. I've been a fan of your work for a long time man. And I got really excited when I found out that you were writing a book on psychedelics and uh, um, I'm just, uh, I think it's a, an amazing subject and I'm, I'm glad someone who's respected yourself is getting it. It's a crackpot subject, right? It's one of those subjects you're like, oh no. Michael Pollan found drugs. Like what's he doing? He's having a crisis and you know, doing mushrooms, it is a bit of a departure. I think that there are people who are expecting another book on food or agriculture. We're a little surprised. Um, but so far people have been following me.

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       You know, who cared about food and ag and there, there's more overlap than I ever would have guessed. I think you caught the perfect wave. I think your book is coming out right when John Hopkins research centers starting to put out these studies on it and people are starting to recognize it. MTMA has amazing results for posttraumatic stress disorder from veterans and marijuana is becoming legal in more and more states. It's like you're catching this wave. And I didn't know that. I, you know, you never know where the culture is going to be. Cause you started book years before. How long did you start it? Well, I started the research in, uh, 2014. I wrote a piece for the New Yorker called the trip treatment, uh, which is online. Um, and it was my first foray into this work. I went down to Hopkins. It's been a lot of time at Nyu.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       And at the time they were doing this really interesting trial where they were giving psilocybin to people with cancer diagnoses, many of whom were terminal. And that seemed like such a weird idea to me that I, I was curious to explore it. And I spent a lot of time talking to patients, many of whom were dying, uh, about how this single high dose silicide been experience a guided silicide and experience. And we should talk a little bit about how the guided changes things for, you know, it's not the image people have is popping some mushrooms in your mouth and maybe go to a concert or going to the beach. But this is a very controlled internal experience, uh, completely reset these people's attitude toward death and it allowed them to die with equanimity. And, um, uh, and when these results were published, um, just last year, they found that, um, that in 80% of the people who had the session, uh, they had statistically significant reductions in standard measures of depression and anxiety.

Speaker 2:          00:02:32       It was one of the most effective psychiatric interventions that the psychiatrist had ever seen. A, which is amazing, a single experience. And then a molecule could change the contents of your head to the, to the extent that you would rethink your mortality. Uh, and so as I began talking to these people and hearing their stories, many of which were just remarkable, I realized, you know, this is not just an article. There's a book here and there's, so, you know, there are two kinds of articles you write as a journalist. One is you f you, you're sick of the topic by the time you finished and you can't wait to be done. And the other is, God, I just scratched the surface. And this was one of those. Did you have any experiences personally with psychedelics before you wrote this? Very Limited, um, I, for some peculiar reason, never did psychedelics in college.

Speaker 2:          00:03:21       They just weren't around. I went into the round, no, I went to the wrong school and I was like a very kind of progressive hippie school. I went to Bennington college in Vermont and there were, there was lsd there before me and there was lsd after me. But I was in this little wrinkle in time where there was only alcohol. I need a cut there guys. Thanks Jamie. Crazy only alcohol in college and I hadn't, so I had no experience of psychedelics. Uh, until I was in my late twenties, and then it was, um, pretty mild. I had a couple of mushroom experiences that would, I now describe as the aesthetic experiences, right. Once small doses, they were, yeah. I don't, I never measured, it was probably one gram, so I'd never had a big trip. And, um, and there was another reason I was, I didn't feel psychologically sturdy enough and I came of age just when the, the, the scare stories about psychedelics were everywhere in the culture.

Speaker 2:          00:04:16       You know, they would scramble your chromosomes, you'd stare at the sun until you went blind. Um, you know, the person who took all the orange sunshine and thought he was an orange for the rest of his life, you know, these stories are out there. And I was afraid to, I was just afraid. Yeah. Well that's, it's, it's not an unfounded fear. Oh No, I'm, no, people can really get into psychological trouble. I think it's really important that people understand that a, it's a, it's a profound, powerful, destabilizing experience. And depending on your mindset and your, and the situation in which you take it set and setting, it can be I'm ecstatic or horrific. And um, and you know, there are many people who had a series of very good trips and then they have that one bad trip. And uh, so yeah, I and I had heard enough stories about that, um, to, to stay away. Uh, so, so discovering this kind of later in life, uh, you know, I was certainly not something I planned on or expected. It's a

Speaker 3:          00:05:20       great tragedy and in my opinion that our culture has demonized these substances and put them in this category of forbidden fruit to the point where you, you, you're so nervous about doing them, you have to get him from some shady character and you don't know where you're getting. Yeah. You have to do them in the, you know, in secrecy you have to be really careful. But we also at the same time are aware of all these incredibly positive benefits from them. And then if we just had professional places where we could go to and when we have these rehab facilities that are available for people trying to kick opiates and people trying to get their life together. But if we had something similar like a psychedelic facility with registered professionals who understand this and who could evaluate you psychologically understand if you're perhaps taking medication that would adversely affect your trip, try to find out who you are, like where, what state you're at in your life. Have you had any experiences before? Maybe you should put you on a low dose, right? Hold up slowly. Let's try something small and see how you react to it. And then I think, I don't think people like myself or pot smokers or people who've done psychedelics, I don't think we do it any favors either because we're always trying to pretend that there is no adverse effects and that there's like, you know, people, when they get into something, they want everybody to do it. And I've been guilty of this myself and people tell us

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       there's a, there's a occupational hazard of a, of a irrational exuberance. And you know, this is what happened to Timothy Leary, right? I mean, people have an amazing experience and the first thing they think is everybody's got to do this. But it isn't for everybody. And I think you're absolutely right. I think that, look, there are risks, but these are not drugs of abuse, right? They're nonaddictive, they're anti addictive. The first thought after having a big psychedelic trip is not, when can I do this again? Right?

Speaker 3:          00:07:12       Any, whoa. The last one I had, I was like, I don't know if I could do that again.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       Yeah. I just felt that way every time it's like childbirth or how, how we here try childbirth is you'd, you can't imagine doing it again and eventually you do. You do do it again. Um, so I do think that we have to find the proper context in which to do it. And I, I think your point is really important. We need trained guides. Um, the experience is completely different when it's guided. Um, because you have a sense of safety. There's someone looking out for your body while your mind is traveling. And this allows you to essentially surrender to the experience. And most bad trips in my experience are the result of people resisting what is happening there. Ego is dissolving and it's scary. It feels like a death and they try to stop it and that can make you very anxious. And so all the guides I worked with and interviewed, they were all like, relax your mind and float downstream.

Speaker 2:          00:08:09       If you see a door open it, if you see a staircase go down. It, um, uh, surrender trust and let go. And this kind of advice changes everything. And the chances of a bad trip I think in a guided situation are substantially less because they know how to help you deal with it and what to tell you when it's happening. Um, so I do think that, um, by, by forcing these drugs underground and into this very kind of unregulated use, um, there were not reports of bad trips were much fewer before the moral panic about lsd in 1965 and when it was still legal, um, you didn't hear about bad trips. Um, you started hearing about it when the culture did this one and turned against a psychedelic. So I think you can create situations where the, the, the risks are really mitigated.

Speaker 3:          00:09:02       Well, I think also the fear like you were talking about, right, but for the podcast or right as we started, what some people worried that they were going to turn into an orange or think they're an orange or all those fears. If you take something and those things are in the back of your head and your that you can literally manifest extreme anxiety that might not have been there if he just relaxed and just had the experience alone, you know, a on its own without all the cultural hysteria

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       attached to it or, or episodes of paranoia. That's, that's common too. So, but a good guide can work you through this. And actually they don't even like the term bad trip. They call it a challenging trip because often very interesting material comes up that you then can work on later. Uh, it's like having a nightmare and you know, analyzing it with your shrink, it actually may be very productive. Um, so, so, you know, I, I was kind of a nervous nelly going into this and I really looked at the whole risk profile and on the, on the physiological side, your body, the risks are remarkably low. And I'm speaking here of the classic psychedelics. I'm not talking about Mtma or even pot. I'm really, I'm talking about LSD silicide man, which is magic mushrooms. Um, DMT Mescalin. Um, they are much less toxic than many of the over the counter drugs you have in your medicine cabinet.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       There's no lethal dose, which is remarkable. There's one elephant that was killed with LSD once. They wanted to see what it would take and it was this, they gave it a massive dose, but to get it to the point where they could administer it, they had to give it a massive dose of tranquilizer. So it isn't actually clear that the LSD killed it may have been the, the Benzos or whatever they were given. I know. What a horrible thing, right? Go online and look up, uh, the elephant who died from LSD. Crazy idea. Uh, and when Quincy was going through the elephants mind before it, animals don't like psychedelics that much. Um, we know that if you, you know, that classic set up that drug abuse researchers use where they put a rat in a cage and they had, there's a lever and they could administer cocaine or heroin, uh, or they can have lunch and they'll press the cocaine lever till they die. You put Lsd in that setup, they press it once and never again. Well

Speaker 3:          00:11:18       set up is always screwy, right, because they really shouldn't be in that situation and it's not a natural setup. Like that's been critical.

Speaker 2:          00:11:24       That's right. And there somebody in Vancouver, these really cool rat park experiments. Yes, that's what you're referencing. And um, basically they thought that this was inevitably what happens. But in fact, if you give a rat a beautiful cage with some things to play with some other rats to hang out with some nature, you know, some shrubs and things, it will not take the cocaine. And that interesting. It tells us that environment has a lot to do with drug addiction. I think for sure with human beings too. I mean, oh, human beings in these really fruitless lives that are very, very frustrating. I think about the people who came back from Vietnam. I mean, I don't, I don't know if I should say most, but a very high percentage of, of the troops in Vietnam were on heroin when they were there. They were seemingly addicted.

Speaker 2:          00:12:07       They were using an all the time and they got back and only 10% had a problem. Um, the others were able to kick it really easily. It's very contextual. It's not all biology, it's about environment. Now, when you were researching this book, um, did you, did you start doing your own personal experimentation? Yeah. Um, I had a series of trips for the book. Um, I had become, for a couple of reasons I'd become very curious about the people I was interviewing, trying to make sense of how they could have these transformative trips on a drug, which seemed implausible to me. Um, and, uh, I also kind of got jealous of the experiences they were having. They were having these big spiritual experiences. And I swear, I don't think I've ever had a spiritual experience. I'm kind of spiritually retarded actually, or was, and um, so I, I realized at a certain point I had to see the experience from inside to describe it in a book.

Speaker 2:          00:13:06       It's also kind of my brand as a writer when I wrote about the cattle industry, I bought a steer when I wrote about architecture, I built a house. I like to get my hands dirty and see things from inside. There's a quality of wonder you can capture doing something for the first time. So in a way, the fact I was psychedelically naive, I saw as a positive because people who've, who really know the territory are not going to have quite the same first experience that was going to have. So that was really helpful. So I, um, I did a few things. I, I went, um, mushroom hunting with Paul stamets. Has he been on the show out there? Yeah, he's a very cool guy. He's crazy. He's totally crazy. And he took me to a spot where you can find the strongest silicide been known to man that he civic northwest.

Speaker 2:          00:13:53       It's near the mouth of the Columbia River. Um, I can't be more specific than that. Don't, you know, people would their mushroom spots. Yeah. So, uh, we went hunting. It was like this, you know, uh, for Lauren December weather and uh, he took me to this place and uh, we spent a couple days outside looking for these mushrooms and we found a salon Ossipee as your essence, which he, he found for the first time and named after his son is serious. Oh Wow. Who in turn is named after the color of mushrooms when they're bruised as your, so there's kind of an institute is committed to fungus.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       He's all in. He is all in wood fungus. And I was very excited when we found a couple and they're hard. I mean, I would not recommend do, do it yourself with psilocybin just because it's not like looking for Chanterelles and morels. Right. There are mushrooms that look exactly like silicide been that can give you a, just an agonizing death. Yeah. But when you're with Paul stamets, you feel pretty confident. Right. And, uh, so we found these and, uh, he said to me after we'd found them, we were sitting around the campfire, we were cooking some dinner outside our Yurt. And, uh, he said, yes, I, these, these are almost too strong for me. I said, really? Why? He says, well, they have a side effect that bothers some people. I say, what's that? Temporary paralysis. Oh, I know why that would bother anybody. So weird.

Speaker 2:          00:15:19       Yeah, I know. I know. Piki Piki Oh my God. I was a little reluctant to take them, but I, I, so I did, I had, uh, my first deals I had been experienced since my twenties was a, and at the time I was like 60 or approaching 60. Actually, I have to be very vague on where all these things happened, when all these things happen. Um, uh, and I had a, a kind of a wonder, I didn't take a lot of them. I made a tea and I had a really powerful experience. It was very much about being in nature. I was at our house. We have a house in New England that we've had for many years and I was in my garden and you know, I've written a lot about plants and I've written about plant intelligence and planet consciousness and things like that. And I've always believed intellectually that plants, domesticated plants are acting on us.

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       It's, it's not just, it's, it's a two way street. We change plants, they change us. We have been, um, uh, in the same way that say the apple tree or the flower is manipulating the B, making it come, pay attention to it, offering it nectar and exchange for it, picking up pollen on its legs and doesn't even realize what it's really doing is being tricked by the plant into pollinating it and caring it's genes down the street or around the world. That's happening to us too. And plants work on us and I, it's a slightly trippy idea, but it's just co evolution. That's how co evolution works. So in, during this experience, I felt that in a way I never had that idea became flesh. And I felt that these plants were kind of looking back at me. Uh, and that they were very benign.

Speaker 2:          00:17:00       They had only good intentions, but that there were more subjectivities in my garden than I thought. You know, we go through the world thinking we're the only thinking subject. Everything else is an object. One of the things that happens on psychedelics is everything becomes, has, has life in it, has consciousness in it. And that was a powerful and beautiful experience. And so that was my dipping my toes in. And then after that I sought a guide because I was trying to simulate the experience I was hearing about at Hopkins and, uh, Nyu where they were doing these studies, uh, not just with the dying, they were doing it with smokers and alcoholics and meditators, all these different groups. But I didn't qualify to enter into those. So I had to go underground. And one of the things I learned is that there's this thriving network of underground guides all over the country.

Speaker 2:          00:17:49       I don't know how many there are. Um, but they're very professional people. They're not drug dealers. There are therapists and some of them are trained psychologists or mds in some cases actually. And they're so convinced of the healing value of these medicines that they're willing to risk their freedom, uh, and their livelihood to work underground. So I found my way into this community and um, uh, and, and interviewed a bunch of people and some of them were not the kind of people you want to trust your mind to. I mean, and no doubt there are lots of charlatans. Everyone I I interview is pretty professional, but some of them were just a little too casual about something I was kind of, um, you know, worried about. Uh, there was one guy, I remember this Romanian Psycho naut therapist in his seventies, who, uh, I said, well, what happens if something bad happens? You know, what if, what if somebody dies, you know, while they're with you getting this trip? And he said, you bury them with all the other people and that, that kind of casualness really troubled me. So I didn't work with him. Um, but eventually I found people that I, uh, I trusted and I had a bond with and I had some very powerful, uh, experiences with them and uh, that did change me, uh, in ways that I'm still kind of, you know, digesting

Speaker 3:          00:19:11       now. I would like to see you back to the garden thing when you're having this experience with these plants. I had a experience once on very high dose of marijuana edibles. I went into a grow room that uh, this, uh, local dispensary had set up. It's just big room filled with plants and it was the first time I like when I walked in, it's the first time I've ever been around pot plants where I felt like they are aware that I was there. It was very strange. It you, you had this weird feeling of them having much more sensitivity than you imagined that they are aware of you. But as you said, they're benign and they just sort of sitting there. But it was almost like they were saying hello to me or that they recognize that I could tune into them because I was so barbecue that I was, I was on their wavelength. When you're out there with those plants and you said that you felt consciousness from them now as an intelligent, rational person, did you start pondering whether or not you, we're just perceiving this because it was convenient and you were hallucinating and adding all this contextual weirdness to this situation?

Speaker 2:          00:20:24       I, you know, I'm sure I was projecting things. I went to them, but, but I've looked at this question and the science of it pretty closely. Right? And how you define consciousness matters here, but plants are conscious in the sense of they're aware of their environment. They have senses. They're not like our senses, right? They're picking up on chemicals in the air and in the soil and light in very specific ways. And they're reacting not just instinctually, but appropriately. There are experiments that show the plants can learn in some primitive way. So we have to understand that we have one kind of consciousness and other animals and even plants have another kind of consciousness. So it's real. It's a real thing. The idea that they're looking back at me, I'm being metaphorical, but I that they're aware of me, um, in the way that the, um, plan is aware of that the bee is nearby and does certain things sometimes to trap the be and hold it there for a longer amount of time to load it up with pollen.

Speaker 2:          00:21:26       Um, there are the world as we perceive it is dependent on the particular senses we have. We've got the big five senses that you always hear about and there's some other littler ones. Um, you know, how we locate ourselves in space. We're pretty good at that too. Um, but other creatures have a different set of senses and, and therefore they live in a different world. So the beef for example, can see ultraviolet light. We can't see. So if you could get inside of bees head, the world would look very different. And you'd see patterns like landing markings on flowers in ultraviolet colors that they can see that you, you've never seen before. Ditto. They also can experience electromagnetic radiation. We can't, you know, it's all around us. We don't feel it. They feel it. And the reason they do is a plant that has a strong electromagnetic field hasn't been visited recently by another b.

Speaker 2:          00:22:22       So they know this is a good, you're going to get a lot of nectar here. And, um, whereas if you, if you're going by, you know, you're flying by a flower and it's got a soft field, doesn't have a big field, it's probably just been visited by someone else. So skip it. So they're living in a world where they're perceiving cell phone radiation and all, all the kinds of crap we're putting into the electromagnetic spectrum. Um, so, so we have to realize that this is a very specific world that we're perceiving in our normal consciousness. That is the one that we need to perceive. It's good for us. [inaudible] we were designed for reflecting our bodies and our upright stance, everything about us. But other creatures are seeing a different world. And one of the interesting things about psychedelics is you get some insight into that.

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       You, you sort of feel it and uh, it's, it's real. I think in the sense of sure. You were imagining there's still a leap of imagination to understand the world or octopus world. That's a really weird, where their brains are distributed over eight arms. Right. And seeing that recent paper that was just put out, see if you could find it, they're hypothesizing that octopus, they might've come here from another planet, literally not, might've been seeded by another planets. Very controversial, but it's from legit scientist. And what they're trying to think of is if it's possible that the eggs of things traveled and

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       comments and somehow that came here hundreds of millions of years ago. And the reason being is that they can alter their rna and that this is very specific to a Octopi are octopuses. Yeah, here it is. Octopus's came to earth from space, frozen eggs billions of years ago. I don't know if they would put it that way, but it's, it's just a theory, but it's a theory that's being bandied about by legitimate scientists. It's crazy. You can do so many things that no other animal can do. Like instantaneously changed their outside. Yes. To blend into their area. Also each arm we can make its own decisions without referring to headquarters. Really? Yeah. They have this distributed intelligence. Wow. And regenerate as well. Yes. Now they are. They're really, they're really crazy. Um, so this idea that there's something relative about our everyday normal consciousness that there are other ways to experience the world is something that psychedelics puts you in touch with.

Speaker 4:          00:24:43       It was just reading this interview with this physicist named Carlo Ravelli. He's a theoretical physicist from Italy. He wrote this book a couple of years ago called seven brief lessons on physics, very prominent guy. And he was telling this interview or in the Guardian that he got turned on to physics, uh, during an lsd trip he had when he was 15. And the interviewer asked him why was that? And he said, well, I saw for the first time that there could be another way to think about time in instead of, uh, you know, past, present and future that it might all be simultaneous. And that's how it appeared to him during this lsd trip. And he's, when he, when he was back to baseline, he said, um, I, you know, I was asking myself, why am I so sure this is the real world? And that wasn't the real world and it was just an hallucination.

Speaker 4:          00:25:34       And he said, the world as it presents itself to us right now here actually physics tells us is not the real world that there are, you know, that space and time are curved. That particles don't exist until they're perceived by a consciousness. You know, all these crazy ideas of theoretical physics. He said, I, it suddenly seemed like worth exploring that, that the world as it presents itself to us is not the only world and, or necessarily the accurate world. And I was very interested that a scientist could develop that idea of a beyond in the way you would think of a religious person developing the idea of a beyond that there's a scientific beyond and there's a religious beyond and psychedelics at least gives us a hint that, that those worlds exist. And that was, um, that was very powerful, powerful idea for me. Have you looked into any of the connections between ancient religions and psychedelics? Like, uh, any of the John Marco Allegro stuff? Yeah, I did. I didn't go that deep into it. I went in deep enough to know that there are a lot of very serious scholars. Um, and, and he, allegro is one and Carl ruck another.

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       Um, and Gordon Wasson, the guy who kind of brought silicide been to the west who I write about at some length in the book, really believe that it was a experience of psychedelics, which has been in culture for thousands of years. Um, we know, um, whether you're talking about the Amazon or Africa or, and that these experiences may have nurtured the religious impulse, you know, where do you get the idea of, of, of, beyond where do you get the idea of a heaven or a hell, if not from some altered state of consciousness? You know, people talked about visiting the underworld in homer's time. Um, so how did they do that? Was it dreams? Uh, dreams don't have the authority that psychedelic experience has? Um, there's something about psychedelic experience that, that, uh, has this, it's not just an opinion, it's just not, it's not a fantasy. It's something real.

Speaker 2:          00:27:38       It's objective truth. This is William James called the noetic quality of the mystical experience. Um, and that's certitude, um, comes from psychedelics. And so it seems totally plausible to me that at the very earliest stages of, uh, humanity, if people were indeed taking psychedelics, this might explain how they came up with these ideas. Um, there are other alternative theories and it's not provable. I just don't know how we would begin to prove it, but it seems plausible. Um, and you know, the ancient Greeks had a psychedelic that they used, we think called the, they called it the Kiki on k, y, k, e, O, n. And they had an annual, a ritual ceremony and it was the only time in the year where you could use this drug. And it was a ritual to for diameter and harvest or planting time. And everybody in Greek society did this and people, it was, you had, it was secret, it was called the mysteries, the Eleusinian mysteries and you weren't supposed to talk about it, but there's a few accounts around and people talked about visiting the underworld, making contact with the dead and um, call ruck who's a classicist to be use as well.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       That was a, that was a psychedelic potion and we don't know what they were using, whether it was mushrooms or something else. Um, the Greek use of drugs is very obscure. They only talked about wine, but the way they describe what wine did to you, there was clearly something added to it that they were adding other plant drugs to their wine because they would have these tiny little glasses. And they'd take these big trips so we don't know what it was. Yeah. Tiny glasses of one tiny glasses. And they were very careful about when you used it and, and you know, people would completely lose control and it was just like, no, this isn't wine. This is something else. Yeah. It is some sort of a psychic delicate from grapes or know it too. Well, I mean, we don't know some people, Albert Hofmann who discovered lsd or invented Lsd, he thought it was air, got that. They'd figured out a way. Air God is a, is a fungus grows on grain.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       And it was uh, the, the precursor chemical to lsd comes from Aragon and uh, air. God is responsible for episodes of mass delirium and European history. You get a really wet year. The air got grows on the Rye. People eat bread made from it and they go crazy. Some people think the Salem witch trials was came after a wet year and people had absorbed, these women had eaten air, gotten, we're having visions and things like that, which was interpreted as witchcraft, which to them was a very thought there were saying that the men had absorbed that and thought they were under spells. Maybe, maybe, maybe that too. I just trip everybody's, yeah. So, um, anyway, so, so they just eat air. God, you're not going to be, you could get gang green. It's a myth. It's not a clean chemical. And, um, but the thinking of, uh, Gordon Wasson and call rock and they were collaborators on this theory, um, was that the Greeks perhaps had figured out a way to derive a pure chemical from Aragon that could be made into something very much like lsd.

Speaker 4:          00:30:49       But again, nobody has succeeded and they've tried for the last 20 or 30 years to take air, got and make something, you know, through simple processes that the Greeks could have mastered. So it may have been a mushroom. Um, you know, there's a lot of psychedelic plants out there. It's one of the mysteries of evolution that, you know, dmt is like coursing through the plant world, thousands of plants. So, so I, I do find it plausible that there is some links between psychedelics. I think psychedelics have have influenced cultural history at various points along the way. And one of those may have been to kind of nurture this religious impulse, but again, it can't prove it. The Greeks spent, uh, some of the great Greek scholar spent a lot of time in Egypt as well. Don't know anything about that really. I was wanting to try and figure it.

Speaker 4:          00:31:37       Yeah. That was, they were trying to figure out what psychedelics, if any, the uh, the Egyptians took and they'd never really figured it out. They made some connections to dmt that is sort of loosely connected to their worship of the pineal gland. Yeah. Right. Where we've found DMT and rats. Yeah. The, yeah, the Cottonwood Research Foundation. Yeah. So you did that film about DMT, right? Yeah. That's really interesting stuff that there's been very little follow up on that. I mean this idea that there might be an endogenous psychedelic like dmt I, as far as I know, we've only found it in the rat. It's hard to look for it and the amounts are really tiny. Well, they found dmt in people, but they haven't found it in the pineal gland. If they haven't, oh, is that right? Founded on the liver and the lungs and that it's being produced that they know that humans produce it and it's indogenous but they don't know whether or not the pineal gland does.

Speaker 4:          00:32:27       I said the pineal gland represents the third eye of eastern mysticism and that was what also they think what does it is the eye of horus that they connected to the pineal gland. If you ever seen those comparisons pull the comparison between the eye of horus and the pineal gland. It's essentially shaped like a cross section of the pineal gland and I'm in the temple and man, see if you look at it up there and they think somehow or another that this is the, the connection between these two. There's a bunch of different things have been written on this, this connection, because this appears in so many different, uh, Egyptian hieroglyphs and they think it might have some sort of a connection between the portal to the afterlife that they think the dmt experiences and the idea of the Dao. How would they, how would they know?

Speaker 4:          00:33:16       I mean, they didn't do they know about brains? I mean, they, well, I don't know how they know how to build pyramids. How'd they know a lot of things. I mean, they did some pretty incredible shit. Yeah. We don't know, you know, because of the burning of the library of Alexandria, we lost almost everything. We don't really know what they knew or how they knew it, but we do know that no, that scholars from around the world would go to Egypt to learn. Well in general, you know, I have a more open mind about many things since I've had these experiences now than I did before. I was a kind of staunch materialists. It's normal. I mean, most people see silliness and hippies and you know, all these people that are out there doing drugs, trying to air quote find themselves, you just see two seems like a foolish venture and then you do it and you go, oh okay.

Speaker 4:          00:34:03       There it's just being done by morons are being described by morons cause it's hard to describe. It's also illegal. So people shy away from it. You don't want to lose your family and get locked up in jail and all these different things that people are terrified of. So you'd like, look, I'm not going to, I'll have a glass of whiskey with dinner. And that's about it. And also, you know, there's a kind of embarrassment. I mean one of the really striking things that I've, I've been on the road now for, this is my second week out talking about this book and I have been struck by how many people have had powerful psychedelic experiences. They don't talk to anybody about. And I come along as a kind of, I dunno, credible person, uh, who's interested. And they, this is journalists too. They turn off the tape recorder and they say, can I tell you a story?

Speaker 4:          00:34:47       And they had something happened to them, might've been in their 20s or 30s or earlier that changed the course of their life. And either because there was a stigma attached to it or it was kind of had this sixties kind woo think about it. Or there were kids around, they didn't feel comfortable and they, so they kept it in this box labeled weird drug experience, but it's not just a drug experience. So this is your mind. You know, the drug may have started the process, but everything you see and in this experience is the, those are real psychological facts there from your unconscious or from your interpretation or your environment. Um, and you know, it's not the molecule that, that, that ordered that for in this experience. Um, as Stan Stanislav Grof, who was one of the pioneering psychedelic psychiatrist in the 60s said that, uh, lsd

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       is an unspecific amplifier of mental activity. There's nothing packaged with the drug. Um, and that's important to understand. So you had this big experience and you put it in this box thing. We're drug experience, but when you take it out, sometimes you find that there's, there's a real gold there. There's fool's gold too.

Speaker 3:          00:35:56       There's, it's an interesting quote that quote you just said cause because in actual studies of the human mind, under the influence of Psilocybin, it's actually been shown to shut off parts of the brain. And so the, the question is, are we blocking off these constant frequencies that are around us? So this experience that's around us, it is our own ego or our own mortality or own desire to stay alive and protect ourselves or whatever. The various blockades that we put up are those diminished by sales side and that allows this ever present experience to manifest itself.

Speaker 2:          00:36:34       It's exactly right. The most, the most interesting scientific finding a of this current generation of research is that when they image the brains of people on psilocybin or LSD or Iowasca, they expected to see fireworks, right? Lots of activity because the experience has lots of fireworks, but they found something that they didn't expect, which was a diminishment of activity in a very important brain network called the default mode network. This is in the midline and it connects parts of your cortex, which is the evolutionarily most recent part, two older, deeper sources of uh, emotion and memory. And it's a hub in the brain and the brain is a hierarchical system. And this, this, this is the orchestra conductor. It's one of the neuroscientists put it, it, it, it's a regulator. So what happens in the default mode network normally? Well, it's very involved in um, self reflection, self criticism, worry.

Speaker 2:          00:37:28       It's where your mind goes to wander. It's involved in time travel, thinking about the future or the past. It's involved in something scientists called theory of mind, the ability to imagine that another person has mental states and it's not just Iraq. Um, it is involved in what's called the experiential or autobiographical self. The way we kind of take what's happening to us and connect it to the story we tell ourselves about who we are based on the past. And the future. So it's, you know, if the ego has an address, it's in the default mode network. And what is the ego do for you? The ego kind of patrols the borders, right? It's the, it's what keeps out, um, you know, things that are threatening to you. It keeps, uh, it's responsible for the repression of subconscious thought or strong emotion. Um, and it, it, uh, it's a defense.

Speaker 2:          00:38:20       It's a set of defenses and psychedelics appear to turn this off, uh, to one degree or another. Take the default mode network offline. When that happens, to go back to your metaphor, um, the whatever is blocking the that's blocking lots of information from coming in, from outside or up from below in your subconscious that's allowed to flow. And so you are getting more information, um, than you might otherwise. And this is a metaphor that, um, aldous Huxley used indoors or perception that consciousness is a, is eliminating more than it's creating its it consciousness is, is reducing our experience to that thin trickle of information we need to get ahead to survive. Um, and that you, you opened the doors or perception on these drugs by turning off this network and lots more information comes in which can be overwhelming, uh, but also extraordinary. I mean there's, that's wonder

Speaker 3:          00:39:22       is there apprehension in writing a book like this and describing these things, like as you're writing it and you're thinking about all these other people that are sort of cynical straitlaced non drug using folks who might admire your previous work on agriculture architecture or whatever and, and you're sitting there going, how do I, how do I get this through without looking like a guy who's losing his fucking mind or it's going Super Woo Depok trope Ron, right? Like, how do you, how do you do this and maintain your position as a serious journalist? Well,

Speaker 2:          00:39:57       I was nervous about undertaking this project. Um, but I also came to think it was really important and um, that there was something here and that, you know, when I started this process, Stan Grof, the guy or I made reference to earlier, he had said in the 60 something I thought was really outrageous. He said that the psychedelics would be for the study of the mind, what the microscope was for biology or the telescope for us. Uh, astronomy. This is a really outrageous claim to make. Um, but as time's gone on, that idea seems less crazy to me that we are learning things about the mind that the, and that these drugs are teaching it in a scientific context and in an individual context. Um, so just because some people think it's embarrassing or Wu is not a way, is not a reason not to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:46       I have to find a way to describe it. And you know, I'm being a little speculative with you talking about origins of religion and stuff, but the book stays pretty close to here's what we really know and here's what I experienced. Um, I'm a science journalist, you know, and um, uh, so I try to draw the line between, now I'm speculating and now here's something that we really know with some, with some certitude, but without question, I had some misgivings about describing psychedelic experience, their legal issues there. Um, and that, yeah, I have a readership. I have a big readership that you know, is happy if I just keep writing books on food. But I had found something to, to interesting to pass up and I've been gratified that, um, you know, I've been talking about this book on like network television. I didn't think I would be talking to Steven Colbert about ego dissolution and here we are.

Speaker 2:          00:41:40       And he actually got the best line off on that whole appearance. He said, um, uh, he said, well, maybe the ego should be a controlled substance. I thought that was pretty good. It is a great line is fast. He's a clever boy. Oh yeah. So, um, so I found though that the, if I was willing to talk about these issues in my experiences, in a matter of fact way mainstream journalists would respond in kind. And so I've been on the CBS morning show and, uh, Terry Gross on fresh air and, and we've had a kind of, you know, conversation where we're looking at these as tools. What are they good for? What are they not good for without getting caught up in the usual, um, uh, craziness that's associated with these, with these drugs. And, um, so that's what I'm trying to do is take that sixties crust off these things and take a fresh look. Well,

Speaker 3:          00:42:32       for someone like me who's been a psychedelic advocate for a long time, it was extremely exciting news that a guy like you were stepping into the fray because you're, you're so well established and well respected already that I knew your approach on it was going to be very clean and that I knew that people were going to have to start looking at this like, wait, it's Michael Pollan's looking at this like this, this might not be completely crazy, but the cultural attitudes about psychedelic drugs or drugs in general were so childlike and our, our view on drugs, I mean, I have a friend, wonderful person, talks all kinds of crazy shit about people smoking pot and take xanax every day. It's like, do people, don't all, I just need a glass of wine and Xanax and I'm good. I don't know why you people need drugs. Like, wow. Like you're fucking crazy. But our cultural attitudes on the substances that are prohibited and that are, that are accepted, there's so strange and they, they, because of our social standing, because we don't want to be perceived as foolish or reckless or in some sort of a mid life crisis or what have you. We were like these journalists that are shutting the microphones off and wanted to talk to you about these profound experiences that they had that they should be shouting about from the roof rooftops.

Speaker 2:          00:43:47       I agree. Look, it's really to normalize this, people have to come out of the closet. Yeah. And some do. I, I was talking to a journalist in Boston who was the local NPR host and he, he on the air live talked about his experiences and how important they were in shaping his identity and the experiences he had in college. So I think we're going to see more people come out of the closet and uh, and have this kind of conversation will, and we can actually look at this experience in the same way now. Yes, it's still illegal. But the fact that there is all this legal research going on, it has created a space where you can talk about it. And I, I'm interviewing all these people and they're describing their trips and they're, you know, they're very straight people and um, and they've had profound experiences.

Speaker 2:          00:44:28       So I think the culture is changing. I really do. I definitely think it is with which, well, I hope so. I didn't write it with that idea that I had this authority that I earned and talking about food and nutrition and then I'm going to apply it now to drugs. I don't think that way. I was just like, I'm starting from scratch. But I do realize that, and people scare me a little when they say, you know, peep psychedelic. People say, you know, you're going to do for, for silicide been what you did for food. So that's really different. Um, you know, I mean, or this woman, I was speaking at Google in Seattle and this, this woman stands up and she says, well, after I read your book, I had a, I had a slaughter, a pig. I had to learn how to slaughter a pig.

Speaker 2:          00:45:10       You made me want to do that. And when I was driving to work today, I didn't think I'd, I'd ever take Lsd, but now or silicide but, but now I feel like I need to, I don't want to do that to people. I don't want them to feel they have to have this experience. You can learn a lot about the mind. This book is as much about the mind as it is about psychedelics. Right. This is a book that uses psychedelics to explore this really interesting mystery call consciousness. Um, and it's also exploring the nature of addiction, the nature of depression, all the, all the illnesses that psychedelics turns out to be very helpful in. Um, you know, but I, I'm not holding a brief that people should do this. Um, I'm not an addict. I'm not an advocate for psychedelics. I'm an advocate for the research at this point.

Speaker 2:          00:45:56       I don't know enough to say, yeah, everybody should do this. This is what our culture needs. You know, I don't, I'm not in that Timothy leary had, you know, I think, I think we have a powerful agent that, that there is good data now that this can help heal people who are really suffering. And the other reason for the openness that's going on right now, that surprised me because I expected to get a lot of pushback from the psychiatric establishment. Uh, and I, and I looked for it. I called around, you know, I want to hear the critical voice on the hopkins work and the Nyu work. And when I kept hearing, blew my mind, it was like, I remember calling the head of the National Institute of Mental Health to get what I thought would be a really negative quote about silicide been research and he was like, no.

Speaker 2:          00:46:38       Then we have to look at this. This is really interesting research, former heads of the American psychiatric association and the reason they're so open to it is that mental health treatment in this country is just a mess. I mean we only reach half of the people who are struggling with mental illness at all, have any exposure to the system. If you compare mental health treatment to any other branch of medicine, oncology, cardiology, infectious disease is accomplished very little. It hasn't prolonged lifespan, it's not saving lives. Um, and yet we have, uh, you know, soaring rates of depression. Depression is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. There 300 million people with major depression or treatment resistant depression in the world right now. Um, and suicide rates are way up. Um, partly it's the vets, but, uh, in general, uh, the taboo is coming off is come off suicide and suicide is climbing rapidly and addiction is, we know, is rampant, so they need some new tools.

Speaker 2:          00:47:38       There hasn't really been innovation in mental health treatment since the early nineties, late eighties, with the introduction of the SSRI antidepressants, drugs like, you know, uh, paxil and PROZAC. Um, they need some new tools and that's why they're open to this. And that's why I think it will be embraced eventually by, um, by the medical world. Well, isn't it on the ballot in 2018 in California? They haven't quite gotten, and they're doing their petition drive right now and an Oregon too. And um, so I don't know that it'll get through this time. It's a weird item to put on the ballot because actually a small minority people know what silicide is. When I on this show, you're the first person who said the ingredient in Ma didn't say the ingredient in magic mushrooms. You have some confidence that your audience knows what suicide in his butt, but it's an unfamiliar world to most people. So I don't know how people vote on that. Right? Yeah. It may be premature is what I'm suggesting.

Speaker 3:          00:48:35       Well, it's all dependent upon getting the word out. I think if people understand what, like the John Hopkins research or just the anecdotal research that some of these people have, uh, had these incredibly life changing experiences. But I think one of the things that you're saying is I think very important is that this isn't for everybody. And that if you have problems with normal consciousness, this is likely not for you. If you're one of those people that has schizophrenia and your family perhaps.

Speaker 2:          00:49:03       Got It. Yeah. And in fact those people are screened out of this research very carefully. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       Because the Fredonia, it's, it's a real issue with people with a psilocybin and Ma many psychedelics, right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       Yeah. What happens with schizophrenia is if you are at risk for it, um, either for a, because of inheritance, um, a psychedelic trip can set you off, can be the trigger for a life of it and other things can to a divorce your parents getting divorced sets people off, go to graduate school sets people. If you're someone who's probably going to get schizophrenia, any kind of mental trauma, if it happens at that window, which is in your early twenties, in your late twenties, I think. Um, and that's, that's why we did see some cases because that's the age people were using psychedelics in the 60s of having their first psychotic break. So yeah. So if you're at risk for that or, or bipolar as well, by the way. That's right. Oh yeah. Marijuana can do it. Also,

Speaker 3:          00:50:01       I think the, the, the numbers though mirror the numbers, uh, in standard populations when it terms of like, I think it's one out of 10, like one out of 10 people have some form of schizophrenia and that's mirrored in marijuana use. I didn't know that. That's right. I think it's the same. I think the problem is, you know, it can exacerbate it or it can trigger it or you know, depending upon, I mean, everyone's biology's different

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       and everyone's, uh, the, the way they absorb these, these chemicals is different. Yeah. And you know, if you are at risk, something's going to do it eventually. Um, so, you know, we, we don't have any evidence of someone thrown into a situation of schizophrenia or other serious mental illness as a result of a, strictly because of the psychedelic experience. It may have been the trigger, but there might have been, it was going to happen anyway. Right. We just don't know. But in general, if you've got serious, if you have personality disorder, if you have bipolar, if you are at risk for schizophrenia, they will not accept you into these trials and you should stay away from these drugs. Yeah. Um, that, that, that is a real problem with it being prohibited. The prohibition has really set back research and understanding decades. I mean, we should have been studying this stuff since the sixth.

Speaker 4:          00:51:19       We had 30 years of hiatus in the research. I don't know if another time where you had a promising line of scientific inquiry all through the 50s and early sixties, that's just choked off. And for 30 years nothing happened. I mean, think of what we would know if we had 30 more years of research with these drugs. It's crazy. So now we're picking up the thread and all that research is being resumed. But your, but your point about prohibition is really important. When you have prohibition, you can't regulate something. It's a free for all. Um, whereas if you did legalize silicide and let's take as an example, you could set rules. You could say that it can only be administered by licensed guides or in a medical context or that no one under a certain age can have it. I mean it gives you a chance to regulate and that's why it's Saner to, to legalize, not in a free for all kinds of way, but in a, in a very considered way then to have the system we have now where people are going to take the drug, whether they should or not without any kind of clearance.

Speaker 4:          00:52:22       Uh, and by the way, who knows what you're getting. You, you know, you can also regulate the, the strength and the, um, and in the case of Lsd, you know, in the 60s there was this period where there was a lot of pure lsd around and then the mob got an interest in it and they started cutting it with speed and all sorts of things and people got into it a lot of trouble. It's also the issue with scheduling, like scheduled ones for things that have zero medical value and that's where a lot of these drugs find themselves. Academics are all schedule, which is just bananas, especially Dmt w the old Terence Mckenna line. Uh, everyone's holding. Yes. We all, we all have dmt in our bodies. We all have a schedule one substance flowing through our veins, which is the most asinine thing in the world to make your body a schedule one substance. Yeah, it is. And the fact is that schedule one means that these drugs have a high potential for abuse, which isn't really true with psychedelics cause they're not addictive and that they have no accepted medical use, which is now no longer true either. Because these studies have shown that they do have a medical

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       use. Yeah. So you know, what I hope happens and what, and what we're on track to see happen is that these, these trials, these drug trials we'll expand. There will be now phase three drug trials, which is the last step before FDA approval. If the results of those trials are anywhere near as good as the phase two trials, the FDA will then approve psilocybin as a medicine and MTMA which there, which probably happened first. They're looking at that too, uh, for use in treating people with trauma. Uh, and then we will be in a world where they'll have to reschedule it a to two or three. Um, you know, the opiates are too, I mean, actually the drug causing most suffering in our country right now in death is not a schedule one. It's a schedule too. I think it's too, it might be three. Um, and so that we may see this in the next five years or so, which is kind of amazing.

Speaker 3:          00:54:22       Well, we've got to get someone like jeff sessions out of there that requires some fairly archaic ideas. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:27       I agree about marijuana. You know, I thought that, okay, in this administration we're going to have another backlash. But one of the things that surprise me is that their voices on the right, uh, supporting this research. I'm seeing more of it. Rebecca Mercer has given money to maps the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic studies for their work on, uh, Mtma. Um, and Steve Bannon has spoken out in approval of this research. So, and Peter Teal is, um, you know, is investing in a psychedelic pharmaceutical company that's getting started in England. So I don't think it, it may not break down in the usual right left way that we're so accustomed to, um, and that may give it some protection.

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       Well, I think one of the things that'll help is anyone who has a loved one that's going through a terminal illness and experiences these things and sees the profound alleviation of anxiety and this just lessening of the worry of passing on. And Larry Hagman was once on a, like a real straight television show, like CBS or Fox News or something like that. And they asked him about his life and like what, what makes him so happy? And he said he had a profound acid trip and you see the host going, what? He goes, yeah, well I took a, a really powerful dose of Lsd and a, it completely alleviated my worries about dying. And you know, I remember seeing him on television going, wow, they didn't know this was coming and seeing this straight interview or just trying to uncomfortably move past the subject. Okay, well the guy from Dallas is a fucking drug addict. I didn't know what to do with it, but he was so warm and smiling and I believe it was a piece on his house because he had some crazy off the grid sort of life and some ecofriendly house and all solar powered and used a well and all this different things. And uh, you know, they were asking him what made him so happy and I'll never forget that he was saying

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       when he did acid wants a really powerful experience. Cary grant also, uh, had 60, um, guided LSD trips in the late fifties, and he gave an interview in 1959 to a, uh, a Gospel, very famous Joseph hyams who was the gossip columns. So that time saying this had changed his life. He was using a low dose. They were, there were a lot of psychiatrists in la who were giving a low dose Lsd to people in their normal talk therapy sessions to essentially it was called psycholytic therapy cause it was mind loosening therapy and it would give you more access to your unconscious and make you be able to talk about things that you might otherwise feel very defensive about. And he had 60 of these sessions and he said he was born again and he said that it had made him a much better actor because he no longer had an ego. Uh, he wasn't crippled by his ego, but then he also said, and it made me irresistible to women. Sounds a little egotistical, have no ego with chicks love. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:57:25       That's hilarious. Are you aware of any of the research are doing now with ketamine and depression and they're there? There's a lot of people that are getting administered pretty high doses of intravenous and intramuscular ketamine for depression, including one of my good friends, a Neil Brennan. He's gone through it several times and talked about it on the podcast and said it was a real game changer. There's a lot of excitement in psychiatry about ketamine, ketamine as an anesthetic. Uh, it's, it dissociative, uh, it, it makes you feel separated from your body and that helps with pain. Um, so it's, I don't know if it's strictly speaking the Psychedelic, it's certainly not a classic psychedelic. It doesn't work on those brain networks. Um, but, uh, it is legal because it's been used as an anesthetic for years and it's relatively safe as an anesthetic compared to some of the others that are used.

Speaker 4:          00:58:15       It's the one they use. If, if, um, you know, you come into the trauma center and you'd been shot or something, you need surgery and they don't have time to check whether you're allergic to any other drugs. That's the safe one to give you in a crisis would carry it around during times of war. And then that's turned to people on the field. Yeah, they all, yeah. Um, and uh, this, they don't really understand how it works, but they give people what is kind of a psychedelic dose. They go way out there. It's fairly brief, I believe, and many people with depression have found relief. It, it's not permanent. Um, they need to, it looks like they need to do it again every six months or something like that. Uh, but it seems to kind of reset the brain in a way that, um, many people are finding helpful.

Speaker 4:          00:58:59       And this is all legal. I mean, you can, there are ketamine clinics, uh, where you can go, uh, and psychiatrists who are, who are administering it to people. Um, so for people who are struggling with depression and can't wait for psilocybin therapy to be approved for depression, which is still several years away, ketamine is, is worth exploring. What about, did you look into that at all? A little bit. Um, I begin is a psychedelic from a root of a tree that grows in Africa and it has been used specifically to treat opiate addiction. Um, and that's God, if we need something now a tool to deal with opiate addiction are clinics in Mexico where they one down there. Yeah. You opened it after he had his own personal problems with pills. He had a back injury, got hooked on pills, was really struggling to get off of them.

Speaker 4:          00:59:47       Went to Mexico to do Ibogaine caught completely off of it felt amazing. Realize like, oh my God, I have to help people. And then opened up his own clinic. It's amazing. I mean there's a bunch in Guadalajara, I don't know where he is, but there is, um, there is uh, you know, people doing it. I don't know exactly what the legal status is in Mexico, whether it's legal or just tolerated. Most drugs have been decriminalized in Mexico, including LSD and mushrooms and a lot of other things to try to do something to curb the violence from the drug cartels at least keep it nonlocal right. You know, a lot of the violence is coming from the drug cartels, getting money to ship everything to the United States with our use. It is very strange that our insistence on prohibition is actually funding one of the largest drug and violence epidemics we've ever seen in terms of like what's happening south of the border.

Speaker 4:          01:00:38       Well, yeah, and think about Columbia to the civil war in Colombia. It was funded by our card or cocaine interest. Um, so I began as a very intense drug. It is, uh, did you do it for though? I didn't, I didn't. Uh, and I wouldn't do it, I don't think because it has big implications for your heart and yeah, and in fact when you, so it is more toxic to the body than the so called classic psychedelics and it can last like 36 hours. It's a very long trip. It's really intense in these clinics. They s you have to be on a heart monitor while they're, while you're doing it. Um, and that was like, I had a, I had a, I have a minor heart issue that, that made me stay away from Mtma, which is an amphetamine. Um, and uh, you know, I mean I'm the kind of guy who goes to his cardiologist before he has six psychedelic trips to check it all out and make sure it's okay.

Speaker 4:          01:01:30       I have something called Afib, a atrial fibrillation, which, um, you know, his Ma you can manage with, uh, with medicine, uh, or there's a procedure you can get it just to kind of occasional irregular. Yeah, it just happens sometimes. Um, but my cardiologist warned me off of MDM may because it can raise your heart rate. Although I've subsequently learned, if you take a Beta blocker, uh, it's okay. Um, so anyway, I have, I've never experimented with that. But anyway, in light of that, uh, I, uh, I would stay away from, I began, but I'm really curious about it just because we have such a crisis with addiction. Uh, but silicide been is, is being used successfully for addiction. I talked to, uh, smoking people, lifelong smokers who broke their addiction with a single or two silicide and journeys. And they had extraordinary

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       stories to tell. Um, I didn't understand how you could have one trip and then give up a lifelong habit. And I asked people about this and, uh, I talked to this one woman, she was about 60, and she was an Irish book editor, and she, uh, she said on her, I said, so what happened? How'd you, how'd you stop? She said, I, uh, well, I first I grew wings and I flew through European history and I visited, you know, the site of Shakespeare's globe theater. And I saw the Salem witch trials and I died three times and I saw my body a rising from a funeral pyre on the Ganges. And I realize the universe was so amazing and there were so many incredible things to do that killing yourself with cigarettes seem kind of stupid. I was like, I could've told you that. Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       But see, it goes back to that, that noetic quality that the, she had a perspective on her life she'd never had or on the universe and that she believed that smoking was stupid in a way she knew before, but it didn't have that conviction. That rock hard review revealed truth, conviction. And I heard that for many people and I asked the doctor about it or the psychologist who was running the study says, yeah, everybody has these Duh moments and they're on their psychedelic trips. Then ended up being transformative. Did you have a dumb moment? I had a lot of insights. Um, I don't know if I, yeah, I did actually. I have different trips. Did you have while you're doing, I had a six or seven. I, I, so I just a couple to silicide trips. One guy did one, not an LSD trip, guided a couple IOWASCA circles.

Speaker 2:          01:03:57       And then, um, I had a really weird psychedelic call, five Meo DMT, which is the smoked venom of the Sonoran desert toad who figured that out, you know, she gets some kind of prize. Um, but um, that's a pretty, pretty potent, very potent and thank God short acting. I'm short lived. Um, it was, it was actually a horrible experience that really, that was my worst. Yeah. I had a great experience. Yeah. Yeah. So what was wrong with it? So I, you know, you take like one puff and before you exhale, um, I was, I mean this is a synthetic version two, right? I was taking the venom. Um, you're shut out of a cannon and there's no lead up, no warm up. It's like fun. And I felt like I was actually like strapped to the outside of a rocket, you know, going through space and through clouds and like the g forces pulling down my cheeks.

Speaker 2:          01:04:48       And it was just this mental storm without any nothing to Orient Myself. There was no space, there was no time, there was no self. And um, it was just unendurable this punishing roar and my years and someone who had done it said, eventually it's like a takeoff and you get into orbit and it, and it's, it's very nice at that point. But what happened with me is I had the, I had the, I mean I felt like it was like, the metaphor I use in the book is like I said, I can't explain this. You can't tell a story without place, time and character. Right. I had none of those. Right. Um, it was just this in Kuwait energy and I said it was, it was like the before the big bang. You remember that? Well, obviously nobody does. Yeah. But there was pure energy and no matter yet, and no time yet.

Speaker 2:          01:05:40       I mean, that's where I was. And um, it was horrible. It was terrifying. And I thought I was dying, but then you, you come down, it was kind of a suborbital flight. And then I started coming down and suddenly I could feel, oh, I've got a body, you know, it was touching my legs. I have a body and like, oh there's a, there's a floor, there's their space. And then there's time and the, and the universe kind of reconsolidated. And I had this feeling of incredible gratitude, not just for being alive, which all of us have had at one point or another, but that anything existed I was, I was grateful for the fact that there is something and not nothing, because I'd seen what nothing was lying. And so in that sense it ended up kind of positive, but you wouldn't want to go there to have that experience. So subsequently somebody said to me a very experienced psychonaut who I was telling the story too. He said you didn't have enough.

Speaker 3:          01:06:34       I was just going to tell you. Really? Yeah, cause you only took one hit. Usually take three, you take three and the rocket lied. The rocket ride leads you somewhere. It takes you too. You take three, three, three, three, three in a row. Take a same time, blow it out. Take a big one below it out. Take a big one, and as you're taking the third one, you're already seeing the world crystallize in front of you had already starts turning into geometric patterns. He put the pipe down, lay back in the chair and just shoot off to the center of the universe. The terrifying thing is you cease to exist like, yeah, it's the one drug that I've ever taken where you don't, you're not there anymore. Yeah. Uh, even an end dimethyl trip to Maine, which is the difference between five methoxy diamond field trip to me is just an oxygen oxygen molecule attached to it, but [inaudible] and dimethyltryptamine is incredibly visually stimulating. Five methoxy is not, it's just white.

Speaker 2:          01:07:26       It was white. It was definitely, I don't know how I could have taken three hits because I hadn't excelled. The first one when I was gone,

Speaker 3:          01:07:32       you said, well, I don't know what you're, I was, I only did the synthetic version of it and you're doing this. And the person I know who

Speaker 2:          01:07:38       did the synthetic version had a very different experience and they felt like they were installed in the firmament as this happy star, but I didn't get there. So it, who knows I did something wrong. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:07:48       I don't think you did. I just think you had a different experience. And I mean I've obviously, there's gotta be some sort of chemical different, you know, you're probably getting other things in that frog venom as well as pure dmt. That may be it. Yeah. I mean there's all, I don't know the answer to the fucking frog spit do you, by the way, no carbs. No frogs were harmed in the making of this drug. It's excreted on the outside of their body and what most people can milk them. Yeah. You, you rub them on a glass and then let it dry off and then you scrape it off the glass and crystal get, yeah. You just kind of squeeze them. And then it sprays the glass and overnight it turns into it looks like brown sugar. Yeah. It's an amazing thing. You're the first person who knows anything about it that I've had that who is going to be able to buy it used to be able to buy legal time recently 2011 jug of this shit.

Speaker 3:          01:08:36       Oh my God. Offline. Uh, I bought it from some company, American chemical company or something and they send it to you. And I had enough to get the entire state of California high for several days because it doesn't take much, but it's not something you want to do very often. I don't think it has the same kind of healing properties because you're not bringing back information that's usable bag a lot. Yeah. I brought back a lot about myself and one of the things that I realized as I was, I recorded what I would do is post trip, I'd hit a tape recorder right when I became conscious again and start talking about the experience and what I remember saying about the five methoxy dmt experiences. Like, as I'm trying to recount what happened, I feel my ego trying to retake, hold the situation and even use words in a way that might impress you with my ability to describe things or as you know, as a professional comedian too, I was aware that like a lot of what you're doing, you're saying things in a way that's pleasing to people so that they get excited about hearing you talk.

Speaker 3:          01:09:39       And I was very aware of that while I was doing that. I'm saying, I'm saying I'm trying to explain things that are not possible to explain because the words that we're using were all invented for a world that doesn't exist in the DMT dimension. And it's once, once you break through, it is so profoundly alien that any words liberating. Yes. Yeah. Well in a way, I mean it may, it may be really truly realize that we are in a soup of, of Adams and that it's not, yeah. There's not like Michael Pollan, Joe Rogan and Jamie Vernon in a room. Here's a wood table. There's oxygen in between. No, this, we're in a, an universal stew of particles. Yeah. And it breaks those particles down, or at least it gives you a view into that and you cease to exist, which is the most bizarre thing because it's so similar to end and dimethyltryptamine chemically, but so different in the fact that you're not there while you're doing regular d n and dimethyl trip to me, which is the active ingredient Iowasca if you'd done that, the pure version of it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:43       No, not the pure version. The pure version is like a very short, much more intense Iowasca experience. I've never done Iowasca. I've only done the dmt version, but the injection or no smoking it, but when you, what you get out of it is you're there while this is happening and you're just blown away and you're like, I can ask drew and I don't see, but there's all these entities are trying to calm you down, relax, relax, take it in, settle down, settle down. They're all trying to calm you down and, and, and, and alleviate. Yeah. It's, it's, it's weird, you know, and they're also fucking with you. Like they give you the finger. Like I had a bunch of jokers that were like dancing around me, giving me the finger machine elves to, I don't believe in that thing. I don't know what that is.

Speaker 3:          01:11:29       Like Mckenna had those experiences of machine elves. I never saw, I saw it. What I described is complex geometric patterns that are made out of love and understanding. They, they seem to me to be like the building blocks of the soul all around you all the time. Like some just gigantic, impossibly large, infinite well of souls. Just these things dancing around you and they were, they were never one thing. They would be one thing for a second and they change into something else and they change it to something different and the more profound the experiences God, the more profound the next one would be. And they kept saying like, look at this, look at this. Like the, but the words weren't real words. That's the other thing. It's like I'm saying the words, look at this and I would have that in my head, but I never heard anybody say it. It was almost like it was triggering those, the, the concept of those words in my mind,

Speaker 2:          01:12:23       right, right. It's, it's pre or post linguistics, some of these experiences. So when you, you, you asked about dumb moments though, but um, you know, I had one where I had this like cascading since flood of love tour. I was thinking about my family, I was thinking about my son and my wife and my parents and, and you know, it sounds like so banal and one of the things that happens is that these platitudes that love is the most important thing there is. Okay. Take that for, except that could be on a hallmark card, but suddenly it's infused with like, yes, that is so profound. And you know what? It is profound. But we have these defenses against seeing it that way because we've heard it so many times, you know, a sense of banality is just from repetition, but you're put back in touch with, you know, a platitude is a truth that's been drained of all emotion and the emotion comes back and it becomes really powerful.

Speaker 2:          01:13:22       So I, there's a whole riff in the book about platitudes and like, oh, we have to rethink these platitudes so it can make you sound like an idiot. Um, but is that right or is that right? You know, and I, and I actually think the experience is more truthful than the ironic cynical perspective that we bring to it in our everyday lives, which is a defense against powerful emotion and being overwhelmed every day by wow, love, you know, whatever it is. So you, you, you end up revaluing those kinds of things. And that the, so that was a really important takeaway from me. The other was having an experience of ego dissolution that which can be scary, can also be very blissful if it's then followed by emerging with nature or other people. And I do think that is the therapeutic agent in these, in the people who are

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       healed, that our ego does keep us from perceiving certain things and it enforces really destructive stories. We tell ourselves like, I can't get through this day without a drink. I'm unworthy of love. Uh, you know, the voice of self criticism all. And we get trapped in these loops. And especially as we get older. And that's one of the reasons I think psychedelics are actually more valuable the older you get because we are creatures of habit. And by now we have these mental algorithms that organize our, our, our response to everything. And sure, that's very efficient. Um, but it blinds you to experience it, blinds you to the everyday wonders and Psychedelics, you know, softens those habits and, and, and helps you get out of those grooves. And for me that was really useful. And uh, it's only, I think it's the experience of ego to solution that allows you to, cause your ego enforces those habits and you get a little break.

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       There's a beautiful metaphor. One of the scientists I interviewed in the book, a Dutchman working in, uh, in imperial college in London. He said, think of your mind is a hill covered in snow? And your thoughts are sleds going down that hill. And after a while, after a lot of thoughts have gone that hill, there'll be these grooves. And then getting to get deeper and deeper. And to a certain point, you can't go down the hill without slipping into those grooves. That's who we are is where like, you know, at this age and, um, what psychedelics do, he said his is flattened the snow, lots of fresh powder and you can then take the slit anyway you want to go. That's a great way of describing it. I've always talked about predetermined patterns and grooves that people fall into. So it's amazing hearing him say it that way, but that's a much better way of describing it.

Speaker 4:          01:15:55       Like snow, the sliding these thoughts down, these already existing patterns. That's amazing. That's, you know what you said about love and, and, and being cynical. That's so important too, because there's something that's something that people are, they avoid sincerity. Like there's something about it that it makes you too vulnerable or too open to criticism or to open to ridicule. And we're worried about being sincere. And I do think that that's one of the primary benefits of psychedelics. Yeah. Well, we live in an ironic culture and we defend ourselves against strong experience or self exposure by adopting this stance. That's ironic. And, uh, cool. And, um, psychedelics is not a cool experience. It's the opposite. Well, it's cool when it's over. Yeah. But yeah, it's, it's serious stuff. And, um, how much did you pay attention to Mckenna's theory? Uh, about, uh, the evolution of the human brain of the stoned ape theory that yeah, I looked at it, um, but I found I didn't find it persuasive. And in fact, if you press Terence Mckenna, he didn't find an entirely persuasive, it's a very, it's an interesting speculation. It's kind of a mind game. I don't

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       see how I can see how uh, psychedelics would influence the mind and, and, and, and create new ideas, new memes, um, and Mike contribute to language. Um, but how does it get into the genes? That's what I had to change the genes cause he said it changed us at the genetic level. I see. Psychedelics is having had a profound effect at the level of cultural evolution that there are lots of interesting innovations that people who had psychedelic experience introduced to our culture. We talked about religion earlier. That could be one. A, I had a wonderful interview with Stewart brand, the founder of the whole earth catalog and his insight. He had this profound insight, um, during a psychedelic trip on the roof of his house in North Beach. And he saw the curvature of the earth in a way he hadn't before. And he said, God, if we could have a phone, this is 1966, we had never seen a picture of the earth from space yet.

Speaker 2:          01:18:05       And he said, if we had a picture of the earth from space, and we could see it as this round space ship, that would change everything. Because if you think of the earth is flat, as most of us instinctively do, it's endless. There's endless resources. Uh, you don't have to worry about limits in any way. But if we had that image and he realized, we, I have to start a campaign to get NASA to turn the cameras around. They're on their way to the moon, show us the earth from space. And he said, I'm going to make a campaign. I know, and he's, you know, this is not an LSD. I'll make a button, very important medium in 1966, I'll make a button. And what should the button say? It should be a little paranoid to get people's attention. Why haven't they shown us an image of the earth from space?

Speaker 2:          01:18:45       Yeah. That's what he would do. And he started a campaign. He started selling these buttons and the campaign got in the newspapers and it goes viral as you know, as viral as you could get in 1966 and two years later and NASA produced that image and he put it on the whole earth catalog and that image galvanize the environmental movement. So it's those kinds of memes that psychedelics introduces into culture and that changes culture, that image changed culture. Um, and I think there are hundreds of them. I mean, Steve Jobs talked about his use of LSD is very important to his, uh, formative experience. And in fact, there's a whole tradition of computer engineers going back to the 50s using lsd that I wrote about in the book. So, but I don't see how we were selected genetically because of the, there was an advantage to the people who were taking a lot of psychedelics. Um, that's where he was at me. Maybe I'm misrepresenting it.

Speaker 3:          01:19:37       His theory is that it coincides with climate change and these lower hominids experiencing experimenting with different food sources. So as the rain forest receded into grasslands, they started experimenting by flipping over cow patties and finding grubs and, and perhaps even mushrooms that were growing on these cow patties. And his theory was that there's a bunch of different benefits. One low doses of silicide but have been shown to increased visual acuity.

Speaker 2:          01:20:06       The hunting dogs in certain cultures.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Yes. Yeah. Make you a better hunter, make you more in tune with what you're doing, um, that it would make you more, it would a central nervous system arousal including sexual arousal. It make you more horny, which would make you productive, appropriate more often. And that the, the very unusual effect that psilocybin has on the mind could have led to language and could have also led to the expansion of neurons. That language to me, brain out of cultural evolution. Sure. Yeah. The doubling of the human brain size though, was it? The particular thing is that it coincided, according to the Mckenna, it's been there. There's a lot of people that disagree with him, but his brother makes a very compelling case for him and his brother Dennis, who's still alive and was a brilliant, brilliant guy. He talked about it on this podcast. He talked about his take on the stone Arab or a stoned ape theory scientifically, why he believes it's really what happened, but that it does coincide with the change in climate of these, these, you know, eight black people trying out different things and that the doubling of the human brain size over a period of 2 million years, it was like one of the greatest mysteries in the entire fossil record.

Speaker 3:          01:21:13       Their alternative theories. I mean, I wrote it up. One of my last big all coincided maybe cooking with fire. Yes. You can explain the increase in the brain size because you get more nutritional value from cooked food, the throwing arm, uh, the, the, uh, the desire to hunt all these different animals and the calculating all these different ways to do that. And communication. I think there's cooperation. A bunch of coinciding fat and it may well be that, that, uh, people were eating everything right? Our ancestors, it's amazing what they ate. And uh, and no doubt they ate psychedelic mushrooms and no doubt. I mean, he also believed that language was a form of synesthesia in the way that synesthesia you can smell a musical note or something like that, that you're taking a sound, a meaningless sound, uh, you know, um, and, and you're attaching it to a concept that maybe that happened on Psilocybin, but a bunch of ideas that never panned out.

Speaker 3:          01:22:05       He was, he was, he was in high or audibly creative person and yeah. And, uh, and, and they're all, you know, really interesting to think about some of them. I think you could probably discredit based on what we understand about genes and evolution, but others are just really provocative. That's where his brother comes in. Yes. His brothers, his brother's a scientist, strict scientists. It doesn't, he doesn't tolerate any of the woo woo and straight and he's skeptical of his brother's idea is to open. Yeah. I mean loved his brother, but he was like, oh, there's a lot of things that weren't really accurate, but also terence Mckenna to, we'd say, well, you know, just putting these ideas out there. The guy was a constant pot user. He was constantly doing psychedelics and really good talker. I mean, he would have a podcast now, right? Oh, it would be amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I promote the shit out. I would too. Yeah. I mean, he was a fun guy to listen to talk and, uh, there's a, there's a podcast called the psychedelic salon that my friend Lorenzo hosts that has pretty much every terence Mckenna lecture and speeches ever done, available for free. You can download it. And Lorenzo is taking these and digitally remastered them to, the sound is better. And it's really awesome that, that, that he's got this resource. But the idea that these, uh, lower hominids experienced ancient hominids experienced, experimented rather with silicide, but then this was what advanced culture or advanced language advanced their understanding of each other. It's a very, very compelling idea.

Speaker 4:          01:23:31       Yeah, it is. And I think, I mean the way I think about drugs like second alex in evolution in the same way, like in genetic evolution, radiation causes mutations and some of those mutations turn out to be really valuable, you know, purely by accident. Some great new trait is introduced to the species and it increases fitness and that person or that individual lives on in the cultural realm, psychedelics are like radiation there mutagens they create change variation and that advances cultural evolution. Um, all that variation, all those wild ideas, 99% of them are stupid and useless. I'll bet. But that 1% can change the world. Yeah, absolutely. All right, let's let you go cause I know you gotta get Outta here, but I wish I had more time because we've got a lot more to talk about. But I'll come back in town. Please do.

Speaker 4:          01:24:21       Please do. And the name of your book. Once again, how would it change your mind, what the new science of psychedelics is teaching us about consciousness, dying, the addiction, depression and transcendence. And is it available in audio form as well? Yes. Yeah. I and I recorded the audio book. Excellent. I'm so happy to hear you say that. I hate it when other people read people's books. I did too. And they told me my first couple of bucks, now you've got to have an actor to do it. And people complain. They said, that's not you. So now I insist under it. It takes a week out of my life. Each time. It's, it's not easy, but, uh, I'm very proud of this audio books, so I hope people will check. That's awesome. Thank you very much, Michael. Thank you, Joe. This was a pleasure. Michael Pollan. Ladies and gentlemen.
