Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Some cool Bosco,

Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Gino and aj from La speed weed. You a la live. Are you tweeting? Joe just recorded a jingle for us. So that's your jingle. New Ringtone. Um, first of all, Gina has been my friend for a long time and he's basically a, he's the guy that turned me onto this whole la marijuana delivery scene that is going on in La, which was amazing for Comedians and for anybody who has a medical card where you could just call this cool dude and he would tell you what the great stuff is and you hang out with them and talk with them and you could buy it and there's all totally legal and above board. It was all good. But somewhere along the line some fuckery ran afoot. They, uh, they came up with some new political rules that keep marijuana delivery services from operating busy. Keep explaining it because essentially the way they've set it up, it's like you would have to have had a license to operate in each one of the houses that you're delivering to. Is that how it works?

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       Well, it used to be called the wild west. You know, out here in California for medical marijuana, um, and it, it very much was until they wanted to regulate it and most of the people wanted it regulated because they wanted marijuana. So yes, let's take, let's have marijuana. Yes, let's regulate it. However it will hold on. People think that marijuana is legal in California, but it is, it is not. Absolutely not. What we have is protection from prosecution. That's what we have, which means that law enforcement can knock your door down, take your stuff, take your, we'd take your cash, take whatever you got there, and you can show them all the papers in the world and they're like, that's great. That's cool. We're glad you're legal. Bring it to the judge and you'll be good to go and you'll get your stuff back in a year and you guys will be fine. And that's happened to us. So.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       But do you get your stuff back? Because I've heard there's a lot of people that have never gotten their sleep, but we always have. We. So how long have they kept your stuff for?

Speaker 2:          00:02:05       A little over a year. Year. So if you have, if you have weed over a year, they're not, they're not taking care of it. It's done a weeds. Useless. It's useless. So you lose how much money that cost like that. Well, you don't have to set it a substantial amount of money of course.

Speaker 1:          00:02:22       And so they give you the cash back,

Speaker 2:          00:02:26       they'll give it. They can actually cut you a check. Yes. Check for the cash from the district attorney's office. Um, I have one, uh, hanging on his wall in his office of them returning thousands, a few thousand dollars to us, which, because again, when there was any sort of trouble, it was all right, you have to go see a judge, you go see the judge and the judge looks at the paperwork. And in our first case, the judge said, we've never seen a more compliant company in California and dismissed without

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       prejudice. And our lawyer asked, instead of dismissing without prejudice, we actually would like that entered in to the record that you're calling la speed. We the most compliant marijuana company you've ever, ever dealt with. So we had an entered into, into um, into the record. Didn't translate though it didn't you guy have a lawsuit on my desk that I'm holding my hands 18 inches apart by the way, that is that high, just lawsuit from the city.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       It's just super unfortunate because it's obviously not the will of the people, you know, whenever something is not the will of the people I could see it's clear by all the gentlemen in this room, we're all grown adults and we all enjoy marijuana. We all have responsible lives, we all do stuff, we all get things done and we all enjoy it and we're taxpayer. So we're normal people. We're not freaks. We're not like Ne'er do wells or someone who's clinging off the system and, and fucking up, you know, a social systems that we've set up for people that are trying to get by in this world. No,

Speaker 3:          00:04:02       we're just guys. And let's talk about what you said just before the will of the people when they voted on this, this proposition d, which is a zoning law. Hold on. Have any of you guys even ever heard of Zoning Ordinance Measure d? Has anyone heard of that? That's. No, of course not. Of course not. Has anyone heard of it, but hold on. We haven't heard of any zoning. Nobody does. That's the thing is nobody pays attention to zoning laws, so now speed, weed and services like ours that are doing things the right way are closed and in the city, because of the zoning ordinance that was passed because all these pot shops are opening up, so they said they're opening near schools and churches got to protect the children. Got Every hilarious that opening them near churches is an issue. It shouldn't be politics in church and state. It's politics.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       They. They say that during the old days of the Catholic church, when they would walk down the aisle with that incense thing, they will be burning marijuana. That's what they would be burning and there'll be wafting it through the room as they walk by your mountain. You know those things, they get around those things, had weed in them. There's a pamphlet online about them. I want to end up. Might not be true, but it seems like it's not sure. Let's just run with it. Like Jamie, genesis 1:47. That's probably one of them. Todd mccord. I'm in quotes, but probably told me that and I'm like, oh, that's a fact. For sure. I'm not even going to bother looking that up. It sounds so good, but certainly cannabis has been part of the human record since the beginning. It's a bizarre time we live in and it's a long, complicated explanation. If someone who's never heard it before, it's like, well, how did it get illegal? Most of it got illegal because of William Randolph hearst, which is bananas that here we are in 2016 and this fucking crazy man from the 19 thirties who's running all these running

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       everything and the the man that citizen Kanes based on the Western welles movie, he was just a maniac and he decided to get marijuana eat to make it illegal so that hemp would be illegal. Correct? Yeah. The tax papers, timber industry, and it is insane that the propaganda that this guy created, the 19 thirties, even though we recognize that everyone knows it, it's a fact. You can watch it. You can watch reefer madness. You can see what's written down, what they were they were attempting to do to make it illegal. The fact that it still sticks in 2016 and you couldn't smoke that stuff that they, that they had any. No, no. It's not psychoactive. Well, that is the craziest part. Like we added on it. We sell him, but we have to buy it from Canada. Yes. Buy It from Canada and bring it down to the United States because even though it's legal and it's not psychoactive, these farmers can't grow it major.

Speaker 4:          00:06:52       They're starting to try to change those laws, but as far as I know, I mean I don't know of any large scale hemp growing operations here in the United States. Not yet. Not yet dangerous. Like China's just dedicated millions of acres. You're on your own. You will have to worry about your own government when you're growing a plant that you make clothes out of. You make paper. That's all they're doing with it. Like, let's be really clear on that, that the Hamptons, they're growing. He can't get high off of it. It's totally non psychoactive. Yet it's federally illegal. There's a fucking plant that makes the best clothes. It makes way stronger fabric, way stronger paper. You can eat it. It has all the essential amino acids. It's like a full complete amino acid profile. It's one of the very few plans that's like that. You can make bio fuel out of it.

Speaker 4:          00:07:37       You can make fucking livestock. Could you look at old ironsides, the USS Constitution, the flag, and, and the, and the sales are made of hemp and there are still. Those are the original things for hundreds of years ago. One of the best things that nature has ever created. This fucking fiber. It has this incredibly powerful fiber. Like who the fuck was at? One of my friends has an actual hemp stalk. And uh, I was over his house and I picked it up and I was like, Whoa, this is like a fucking alien plant because it's hard as a hardwood tensile strength. The stronger than steel when it's wound. Yeah. So it feels hard like oak, but it's light like Balsa Wood. Yeah, it's really weird. You can make spaceships out of this shit. It feels like it's light and strong and we're not using it because it's illegal. It's fucking crazy. Crazy. Parachutes used to be made out of it. Uh, I know George Bush senior jumped out of a plane in a with a hemp parachute, you know, so. So all canvases, all canvases. The Mona Lisa was painted on, cannabis was unhappy. Our founding fathers had hempfields in their farms because the head cleans the fallow fields after wheat fucks up your fields and corn fucks up your fields. Hip goes in there, cleans it all out. It's. So, it's such an identifier of how goofy people are here in 2016,

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       that that's an issue that we're dealing with this weird hemp thing because it's related to marijuana. Does anyone hear this though? I mean, did people really with, with trump and hillary and Bernie, do people really care that they do? They don't know. I don't know. Most people have no idea. Most people think there's some health related risks and that's the reason why it was made illegal. That's why we're. It's so for such a frustrating time for us because we start talking about Zoning Ordinance d and people are like, I'm so bored. Can't we just get baked? What do you mean you're out of business? Well, don't you feel like. How long have you guys been in the business? About six years. Six years. How much has changed in six years? So much since I've had a card. I got my card in.

Speaker 3:          00:09:42       It was the nineties, the nineties, so there is one. It was just one state here. When we got in the business there was about five states that are legal now there's 24 in Florida is going to go. That's going to be 25 plus DC. It's half the country. That's crazy. And CBD is at. If you conclude cbd, there's only like seven or eight states that are not participating, like seven or eight states. I guess now I'm thinking about it. I guess it was more like 2001. It's still way early, but my, my point was going to be that it's way more relaxed now. It's way more prevalent. I used to have to go to Inglewood. I go to Inglewood wellness center is one of the gentleman that worked there. Got Shot and that's when I stopped going. But that's how it was when we started, right when we started, how it wasn't much of a smoker when I moved out here to California. Um, and uh, you know, he kinda sending, now you're being condescending. You guys fucking with each other. Right? So, so, you know, uh, we were working in technology for the government before we started speed. We together because your CIA and infiltrated, you know, um, don't put me in sturgeon Simpson's category.

Speaker 3:          00:10:57       Let me tell you this story. Real Cook, sturgill Simpson was onstage and some dude yells out in the audience, sturge will please tell me not really a CIA assassin. And he just shrugged and went on the next side. Wheeler Walker Jr. How funny is that dude? Oh my god, he's hilarious. So, so Ha was um, uh, we were working in a stressful environment working for congress, uh, uh, at the time. And he was actually drinking to medicate himself as we were, you know, working, doing technology, coding and things like that. And he started playing with a new world tropics to say, you know what? I'm not going to drink anymore. And I said, instead of new world tropics, why don't you try cannabis? YOu know what? I was that guy who had the shelves of modafinil and annual paps and all and you're healthy and all these different crazy thinGs that you can get on off the market.

Speaker 5:          00:11:54       And gina was like, just smoke this. Just put all that shit away. Put the booze away and just smoke this. I'm like, no, it's going to make me freak out. Well, one thing that nootropics do help, it helps me to maintain memory while under the influence because it's one of the most slippery things while being under the influence of pot as the memory is, the memory gets real slippery. Sure. Yeah. I think I gave him mouth the brain also. Uh, when we first first started. Yeah. That'll help. Some people say that nicotine actually helps in some strange way. I use nicotine everyday. Your nicorette. I've never smoked it. He started, he started chewing the nicotine gum, you know, a few years ago. And I said, so you're on the ball. I love it. Yeah. Well this is what it is. Like nicotine itself apparently has a similar effects to a lot of nootropics and that it does something to stimulate your brain function, but smoking is fucking horrible for you.

Speaker 5:          00:12:48       So like, it's not really the getting of the nicotine, which is so confusing because you automatically assume nicotine equals lung cancer. Everybody dies. That's so sad. why do they do it? And then you, why are you doing nicotine? And they go, no, it's the smoking of these chemicals that's fucking up your lungs. And it's giving you cancer, it's irritating your lungs. You know when people cough, it's harsh. Fucks your lungs up, you get cancer, you die. That's what's going on. it's not the nicotine's fault. No, it's not. So nicotine itself is some sort of a very strange compound that sort of like stimulates your mind a little bit. Yeah. I think it's the drug that just knows, like if you're wired, it relaxes you. If you're a little bit cloudy headed, it gives you a boost of energy to it. It sounds like it's in your veins, your. That's your friend. The drug. Who knows? man, who knows? A boy has no name the gum. It's so gross. I love it, man. Look at you. The drug that knows. That's hilarious. The four milligram coated for flavor from target. Oh brother.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       I was. I wanted, I wanted to do what I could to try and help help this situation. It wasn't, didn't really need to be helped that much, but I said, look, you should just try, try marijuana. Um, it's, it's what regulates my mood and has since I was. I've been smoking almost daily since 15 years old. Um, and uh, so I, so I said, let's, let's, let's go to the doctor. And uh, and he didn't want to go to the doCtor with me.

Speaker 5:          00:14:16       no, no, because this is back in the early days when everything was sketchy. So we go to this office building that is up in san fernando and there's barbed wire around the building. We go into sketchy office building and I'm, I'm freaking out the whole time, you know, our dad's a cop, you know, we've got clearance from the government of what do we, this is crazy and chinos is just like, chill, we're fine, you know, cheer, nicotine, let's go. And we go into this office, this doctor's office, clearly not a doctor's office. And they say, you know, the doctor will see you both now and now I'm freaking out thinking like what? I have to get undressed in front of my brother and sit on the paper with this doctor. I don't whAt I'm doing.

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       And we just go into a room and there's a table and he sits across from us and he asked me first. Unfortunately, what you need weed, and I said, you know, and I'm staring at him, my brothers look at me and I could feel him going, don't fuck this up, like don't fuck this up. So he's like, oh, you have stress? I said, yes, you have terrible sleep. I said, yes. It says okay, you have weed. And he called it, we'd, he called it wheat and then he goes to my brother, why do you need we eat? And my brother goes, I have stress and trouble sleep. He the okay you have weed. And we got these papers and it felt so sketchy, but we went to a dispensary that afternoon and it's like those early people that started to open dispensary's like the inglewood wellness center.

Speaker 3:          00:15:29       Those people who like the pioneers in the wild, wild west. That is a gangster moved. Well, it took some of the criminal element to be in business at that point and that's why going back to these laws that say you had to be in business before 2007 in order to even be considered in these few that are allowed. Well let's explain. Let's explain the whole zoning thing. So the issue is delivery, right? That's where the issue is. So prop the is what governs all of las marijuana laws. That's a zoning law. Um, so there's 135 shops that are allowed. Those are the ones that have been operating since 2007. They're called pre ico is any other shop you go to is illegal. Any delivery service you use in the city of la is illegal according to proposition d, which we are fighting in court by the way.

Speaker 3:          00:16:19       We are fighting that and that law just came out in, in uh, 2012, 2013, 2014. So we had, we hadn't been in business for years. We had already been working with the state government for years on, on the process of legalization. we advise the state assembly were the only retail company on the, on the board of equalization stakeholder panel. I know, I know I'm in the weeds right now, but like we are the company that instead of suing us, you should have just said, hey guys, what's a good way to do this? You know, that that's important to talk about that, you know, the board of equalization is kind of like the irs for the state. If you're a commercial business, you pay your taxes to the board of equalization. Well, the board of equalization chose our company as the one retail company that they wanted to present to the legislature, to, to the people with, um, with we presented with the New York state. Uh, I mean, uh, the California state troopers, uh, the highway patrol, the teamsters insurance company, and an app company and us. Can I just say the board of equalization that, that name, it sounds like some sort of an overseer in a woody allen movie, but the future they kind of are the board of equalization that some like fucking utopian nightmare mirror the right theory. How are you? I'm just trying to be a good neighbor and not good enough white man. See any business owner. Here's board of equalization and they're freaking like,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       they're laughing, they're laughing, but they're also afraid. What is equalization mean? It would be a word that seems like they made that word up. Now that I think of it, that's kind of fucked up that it's called equalization. Like we're going to take the businesses money and give it to y'all here so we can all get equalized. That doesn't, that doesn't work. No, it doesn't. It. Some people are lazy. It doesn't work. This has got to be a way though. They think that a universal basic income that giving people $13,000 though, like giving everybody through some. Michael shermer actually just tweeted this, who's the really intelligent skeptic guy, um, and they think giving people $13,000 a year, like giving it to everybody would reduce crime, would reduce poverty. It would give people chAnces to pursue other things if they had the universal basic income. It's a really strange concept because it's one of those things that everybody has an ego reaction to.

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       I definitely did. I heard it and I was like, get outta here. You can't just give people money. People are too lazy. But the more I read about it and the more I see people who are quite a bit more educated than me on this subject, they think that it's possible that doing something like that would actually cost less money in the long run because it would start a cascade of positive events that giving people enough money to get by on right. That, that would start like a series of events in a lot of these people's lives were issues, would be taken care of, that are insurmountable. Otherwise it'll start some momentum in a positive way and that you're going to deal with less crime and you're going to deal with less of violence. So you're going to deal with less need to deal with the problems and the financial repercussions of crime and violence.

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       It'll overall cost less money to the community. I'm skeptical though. My knee, my knee jerked. Yeah. When I did mine did too. And I was first talking about it with my friend eddie wong from a vice from that vice show. What's his fucking chose in world or something? Is that what it is? Um, but he brought It up and I was like, why get the fuck out of here? And then when I realized that there were a lot of people bringing this up, I said, okay, well let me, let me put my knee down with dj, let's put, let me just open mindedly look at this. And I'm like, oh, okay. I'm looking at, in the port, like if you give people money, they're just going to be lazy and then everything going to get anything done and you're going to deal with a bunch of lazy people.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       Plateau effect, right? So like the worst fears that people have when they're worried about welfare, that you create a welfare environment where people get accustomed to that and they have no ambition and nothing ever gets done. It's Almost a way to poison people's ambition is to give them money. Like Switzerland just had thIs thing where they were going to give everybody, I think it was like $2,500 a month, just like free income. And then hope that that would pay for everyone to be like a, just a little bump. So they would keep their jobs and stuff like that and they're like, they're shitty jobs would feel a little bit better, but theN they, uh, they denied it and yeah, it didn't pass. But that would be interesting. Everybody getting free income. Well yeah, that's the idea behind this and Switzerland is a very inclusive country where everyone serves in the military and has To participate.

Speaker 1:          00:21:08       That would be a good place to try something like this because America is obviously a little bit more loosey goosey with that kind of shit. We gotta spread that we had dollar bills. Y'all. How much, how big is Switzerland? Like how many people live there? I mean that's, that would be like given universal basic income to la, you know, really that, I mean those are the arguments for like universal healthcare and all that. Well it works in Finland. Well Finland is like the size of long island and westchester county one. I mean just think about like the stuff that flies in Canada, right? You know, Canada has a totally different country. They're connected to us but they're fucking completely different and they're right there. So if anybody says it works for Canada, like there's only $30, million of that's right. Have a huge fucking country and there's only 30 million people and they're just nicer. They are. You just nice if there's a canadian that room, you told it, you know it immediately. They're nice. They're like some of the nicest fucking human beings on the planet. It's a one country that I wouldn't think twice. I wouldn't think twice about moving to Canada. Well, they're ahead of the curve on cannabis for sure. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Delivery is the only option in Canada, right? And it's government sanctioned. Yeah. The government is essentially this new guy that has gotten in. What's the new guy's name? I'm the young guy. The handsome fella.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       I gotta think of the guy from dunes burdens. The government is also behind their alcohol sales also in, in Canada. Like you can't buy liquor unless it's through the government, but I'm not as a drug dealer in Canada, Canada. I kinda, I, I'm very, I'm very libertarian so I don't like the government involved wherever possible. Yeah. That's some interesting rulings about comedy up there too. There was, there was one guy that got heckled by some women in a nightclub in vancouver and apparently they were really drunk and you know, things happen in comedy clubs. People get crazy, they yell things out, you're serving people drinks, they're going to get crazy. They're gonna yell things out. So he was yelling things at them and he said a bunch of rude stuff about them being lesbians, but you're homophobic stuff and they suit them and they won $15,000, $15,000 going down his men would it once people start hurling insults at each other, like the women hurled insults at the comedian, the comedian hurled insults at the woman.

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       I don't know who started it off. I think that would be imperative to find out who started it off. But, um, I know that the guy was on stage doing stand up. So they're not supposed to be yelling. This isn't a conversation. If they're talking to him, I guarantee you, unless he's a crowd worker, I don't know if he does. He's a guy that works crowds, but I guarantee you most likely he was getting interrupted. So he's trying to do is act for all the people in the room who's was getting interrupted and then it got ugly. Right? And what's the answer to have people sIgned waivers before they walk in the comedy clubs. It's silly. It's just you can't. You can't have a monetary reward for someone that heckled. You shouldn't be able to extract money. A comedy club like that because you go in trying to make it happen.

Speaker 1:          00:24:22       Because I go, look, you go to a baseball game, you get hit with a foul ball, you die. You can't sue anybody because it's kind of a given. That dangerous shit is flying around. Balls are fast and hard. Fuck baseball. I didn't know that could happen, but if you go to a comedy club comedy club, first rule is you're in the audience. Shut the fuck up. Second rule is let the comics say what he wants to say and you might get offended. That's the chance you take going in there. Yeah, I mean I don't want to stand up for the headquarters in any way, but the only way that it could be different is if it's like rick ingram works at crowd constantly, you know, talks to people and if you have thin skin, he's hilarious. But if you have a thin skin he'll fuck with you, you know, and Maybe you didn't want that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       And so maybe you insult back and you know, rick knows how to handle stuff like that, but I'm saying if he's one of those kinds of comedians that, that works a crowd, that's cool, you know, but it could have been that he insulted them first. It's the only time that I could see where they would get pissed off. From what I understand, they had been heckling all night. That was according to his version of the story, which it's not like people wait to hackle you know, someone who's a heckler. If there's four comedians and then the night and the fourth guy goes up, that person's probably been tackling all night. Right now they're just drunk. Or does it scare you though? like, like doing material in Canada in the future, if it gets heated with like you and a heckler or you gonna be like, shit, this is, can I better step back a little before I call her this and that humanness and that kind of, that kind of opens the door for this to be able to like, oh, now we're allowed to sue if this, if the comedian is mean to me.

Speaker 1:          00:25:54       Yeah. Well it's, it's a dangerous precedent to set and does, does not make me comfortable and hopefully I'll never have to deal with it when I'm up there. But what about though? I mean there is like makes new orleans look like blame like provo when she was a beautiful town too. I love performing there. I find crowds and Canada to be really polite. I mean I've had some headquarters in Canada, but you're going to have hecklers when you get people drunk. They're going gonna fuck it up. I think the only thing you could do is probably like they're doing in South Carolina. You just, you have to boycott it to make some kind of change, you know, uh, how they're boycotting South Carolina. One's he caught going to vancouver because of this one room that. No, no. The loophole was at the end of heckling. You could just say, just kidding.

Speaker 6:          00:26:46       You're like a fucking do the thing. So I know what I'll do with a plane crashes. I'll just jump out at the last second. Right before it hits the ground at the end goal. Allegedly. Yeah. You don't understand physics? Not that I do, but yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:27:02       I don't know, man. It's not a good thing. It's definitely not a good rule. Then the fact that he lost his very dangerous for. Well, there's another one going on right now. We're in. Yeah. Another guy got in trouble. What is his name? Chris? Something or other is a comic from montreal? I think he speaks both languages. I think he speaks french and english. Chris wade. Is that his name you see there? They don't have the pesky first amendment to deal with that. Yes. Yeah. So this is what happened with this gentleman. Find out this dude's name is a dude who's getting sued because there was a sick kid and he made a joke about it. He, the joke was, it was something. I'm going to paraphrase it. I'm gonna do a shitty job, but a lot of people donated money because this kid was dying. But then he lived for like several years and then the joke was, hey, you know, he wasn't even sick or something like that. Mike ward. That's it. What is, what is the joke? Pull up. Pull up the joke so we could analyze it. What did he say? Oh no, I'm afraid. What was, does it say what the joke? The joke is,

Speaker 7:          00:28:11       oh,

Speaker 1:          00:28:12       a kid's got a serious illness. That's not a snapchat filter.

Speaker 7:          00:28:19       Hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       Um, we're looking for whatever the joke was. It doesn't. Does it show the actual joke or. No? No, I don't think so. No. Maybe it might've been too offensive. That's the thing is in this room where it's like, no rules. I'm afraid to even make a comment on that. That's a joke. You could play the joke. I'm not going to laugh. I'm not going to smirk this. There's a bunch of comedians you know, that really enjoy saying ridiculous shit that they don't really mean because it's funny because it's so shocking. Ridiculous that it's funny. there's a real danger in pretending that those guys are just speaking their absolute mind and like giving affidavits and court relaying incidents with a cold hard disengagement from the facts. No, these are comedians trying to say fucked up shit that they don't really mean and one of the reasons why it's funny, it's because you know, they don't really mean it and they're saying it and it's ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:29:15       Like briAn holtzman, right? He's a great example. Perfect example. He's one of my favorite comedians ever and he's so ridiculous. He says thinGs that I don't want to give away any of his material, but he says things that he absolutely does not mean. Right? And he says it in this character and it's fucking hilarious, but it's a landmine for anybody looking to point to a guy's performance on stage and try to that somehow or another, what he's doing is what he really means. Right. And if you see audience members getting angry at it or or something that it's hard to imagine how they can't see that it's a character. Yes. You know, that's not hate speech. It's just a set material. Maybe think that we're too close to it honestly because I think if someone didn't know it might take them a few minutes, like say if you're not a savvy comedy store, regular type person or someone who enjoys common and a regular basis, you could go and watch holtzman and go, what the fuck is going on here? And that might be what the fuck is going on here? Might last 10 minutes before you catch on like that. This guy, because he'll let you in on it and he'll smirk and Joke in between his, his ramblings. But I could see people not getting it. Well that's the thing. He'll, he'll jerk and I'll make the smirk and be in between things. But the people who are already mad, they skip over that part. Yes. They just think he's a crazy person.

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       He never justifies though. Because I mean, I think I've seen in your special. You say a lot of this is just comedy people. Yeah, but does he ever say no? No, no, he didn't. He did a 15 minute version of his gay son the other day. I have never seen a full 15 minute version of that. It was beautiful. That could be a comedy special. Just that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:02       Yeah, that is the best examPle of his bits too. As far as like the most fucked up thing you could imagine like in joke form, but it's obviously not true. It's so preposterous to it. Oh my god. It's funny and it could offend people, you know, and if it does to live in a punitive society that, that he can't perform being an artist and perform his art because he has to worry about being sued is already not making enough money to be sued for no. Well, here's the thing. You have the right to be offended you, but people don't have to agree with your opinions on things. So if you're going to see art, right, whether or not you think stand up, comedy is art, you're creating it, right? You're creating that. This guy is performing art. You either like it or you don't like it, and if you don't like it, you don't have the right to interrupt it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:56       You're supposed to leave. Just leave that sort of polite person does. I've seen some stuff that I didn't like and I left. I've gotten to see a movie and I didn't like it and I left. That's, there's nothing wrong with that. But to interrupt it for everybody else that's watching the movie, that's a, that's a piece of shit move. So this, you rewarding someone who did a piece of shit move. It's like it's not a good person. You know, a good person doesn't heckle me. It's not that people who were hecklers are bad people but they're drunk and fucked up and that makes them a pain. The ass, you know. But a lot of drunk fucked up people were actually good people. Right? But when you reward that kind of behavior like this, like you could say that you think that the comedians not funny, you could say don't ever go see him. Could cast judge

Speaker 3:          00:32:39       me. You can do whatever the fuck you want. But to say he owes her $15,000, then it's like, okay, who is the retard in charge? Who the who the fuck said yes to this judge? Is this a group of people? Can I sit down with you, fucks and talk to you and try to figure out what the fuck is going on in your mind, right? You can charge him. Ha. What's the punitive rule for, for the labeling that you know you have to put the cancer and that's proposition 65. You have to label all marijuana products with this, with this warning label that says this product is known to contain chemicals that may cause cancer. So every, even though cannabis is knowing that treat cancer is known to not proven to, but known to cause we can't do the right research search. Every piece of cannabis has to have this, this label on it or else you can be fined for not having the label.

Speaker 3:          00:33:37       Again, punitive society. And we got sued. We got sued for not having the labeling on our packaging even though we did so. So they decided to put a lawsuit against 400, 800, 800, 800. It just went through weedmaps and just see what everybody. Everybody. No, they just did it just to try to scrap some money out of you. They said we'll make this go away. Pace the settlement will make it go away. Wow. And this is what this person has done to hundreds and hundreds of businesses. That's how they make their living. And she sued us in 2014 control. Right? That's crazy. And products have it on it. So we, we were sued without even one burden of proof because when we were like, look, everything has it on. So did they just say the lawsuits invalid or know enough to go through with it? Now we still got to go through it because you can go through with it wherever you were filing right now and after it's filed then I got to file a complaint with the bar and do all this bullshit because anybody can sue anybody now.

Speaker 3:          00:34:34       And it's really, really hurts businesses that hurts good people. So how much did they want to settle? About $20,000. Oh my god. So fucking criminals stealing money from people from dispensary because they think they have it. But where they made their money is a on. I mean every place has to have it. If you walk into target, you walk into walmart, they all have to have have this thing because anything that has plastics in it or anything. Oh, I see that sign everywhere now. Once you get sued, you're everywhere. You see. And that that's the law you got to have posted. So it was like you'd never hear the word lesbian in vancouver again. That's that. Those, the glory days are done. Is that what he yelled a lesbian? I don't know what he said. I don't remember what he said, but I've heard worse so. So it's too litigious of our society. So companies, bigger companies don't just settle because it's easier to just settle. But you know, a smaller companies I guess they think because marijuana,

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       you just have so much money. However, our tax burden is almost 70 percent. There's no real money In it when you're doing things by the book and they just passed another 15 percent sales tax on top of marijuana. You all in California just got passed this week through the senate and the assembly. The governor signs that another 15 percent tax is coming our way and that gets passed to the consumer. Yeah. I'm on top of the sales tax on top of the city tax on top of the excise tax and some of the cities and counties in California having another, another 10 or 15 percent on top of it. You're also texting the growers in our office so they're taxing anything that has anything to do with what you get as a final product. If that's the case, why would they be trying to stifle business?

Speaker 5:          00:36:18       Wouldn't they want to promote business because business is going to give them more tax revenue. This is the California. It is. It's because, and a lot of it is because of law enforcement unions and and not just them, but prison guard unions and all these. There's a lot of unions that put pressure on different politicians to try to keep the laws in place or to make them even stricter because they want more people to get arrested, privatized prisons, subsidized presence. So that is such a dark concept that this is something that we're really dealing with it. We really are. And the problem is the penalties for the users, like having a joint is so very small, but the penalties for the business for doing it the wrong way are huge. Like our business is being crushed right now over a stupid zoning suit. Um, so there's this big gap betWeen the business penalty and the consumer penalty so that the business has no incentive really to do it the right way.

Speaker 5:          00:37:11       So because the consumer what you're going to go into a shop and ask them, hey, do you pay your people on the books? You know, can I see your compliancy packet? No, you just go $40 a month. I love that oj. I'm buying it, you know? So with all these taxes that $40 eight, it's got to go to $100. Are we going to pay that or we just going to go and call our dealer or whoever that we've been using for 20 years. So it's gonna. It's just gonna make the black market even a broader. Well that's an issue that they've had in Colorado for sure, but people are happy to pay the taxes because they liked the fact that it's free. Like the thing is free. They're like, you can go and you can buy pot. You don't have to have any kind of a license, you don't have to any and you can just go do it and it's working.

Speaker 5:          00:37:51       So 39 percent is what they have to pay. Like recreational and medical is much less, but people just pay it, you know, we're not happy about it, but regulation is what we want. We just want to follow. We just want the path to the way to do this the correct way. Just make it fair. Let's see what's going on in denver should be the shining light for the rest of the states because what they've done is they've, they've, they've made money like they have so much fucking money from tax revenue. They made more money from tax revenue than they did from alcohol taxes. So last year Colorado takes in $40,000,000 in tax revenue for cannabis. California takes in $40 million dollars in tax revenue from cannabis. We have 30 million people in this state compared to colorado's, what? Five, 6 million. We're not collecting the taxes here, so if the companies are not following the rules as they stand, why we've thrown all these new rules at them and setting up these monopolies like here in la with the monopoly stifling good businesses, this doesn't help us and it doesn't help. The consumer either doesn't make any sense. It doesn't. It's knowledge. It would be dangerous. It's not like if you get more pot out there, it's going to flood the streets and the people are going to jump from the building.

Speaker 2:          00:39:01       It's actually less dangerous or that we've. We've proven that and again, that's why we're invited over and over to places like the board of equalization and to other places like oakland. The city of oakland wants to follow our delivery model. It's because the way we do things actually creates less, um, less crime, less opportunity for crime because it's just, we're in, you're in your living room, you know, we know who you are, you, you sent in your documents. We know you live at that address. We know you are. I went to a doctor, we know everything matches, so no one sees me walk in or out of a place with a commodity that that's more expensive than diamonds. You know when, when you're looking at a, at a dispensary, if, if people are walking in and out of there with duffle bags, what do you think's in those duffle bags? it's very easy to, to, to, for, for crime that happened because it's visible.

Speaker 5:          00:39:57       Done over 200,000 deliveries, zero salts, zero robberies, zero complaints. Knock on wood, bitch. That's great.

Speaker 2:          00:40:04       I will just let that go. Know that that's an importance to that, but it is because we are very thoughtful about how we go about, um, when you take a look at business, making sure the person is who they are. We do a google search on every single patient. We turn down as many patients as we would take maybe even more just to make sure they are who they say and, and uh, that uh, uh, background of easy background check doesn't pull up anything that says we shouldn't work with someone like that.

Speaker 5:          00:40:40       Yeah. Pedophiles apparently love weed too, but we don't love pedophile so we don't let them also like milk know what the fuck are we doing? So connecting marijuana with crime. So stupid, you know, there's no facts to back it up anymore just because just because some people who use it are criminals, but that doesn't mean it's causing anything. So there's no rationale for any of this. And you're fighting against the idea of tax revenue. Like you're, you're holding back revenue because there a lot of people. If it was, there's a lot of people that are on the fence. Like man, I think about opening up a pot store, but fuck, you know, would have jeb bush winds, you know, there's a lot of people that think like that. Those people are not going to go in, but if it becomes completely free and legal the way up, you know, blue jeans store would be blue jeans.

Speaker 5:          00:41:30       One of my, my grandma that I was trying for a reference anything which is that if that happens, store's going to open up everywhere and the money's going to be crazy. It's going to be a new economy. Well, it's still very possible with all the people here. yeah. They'll still have to follow regulations, you know? Um, it's already billions on the books. Well, they should follow regulations because I don't think that should be available to everybody. I think when you're young, especially like this kind of fucking pop they have here in la, you imagine if you were a six year old kid in detroit and you got a hold of this shit. No, no, it'S not. Six year olds are not ready for this. No, it was definitely. You should definitely come of age. Yeah, I don't know what that age is. I think we would have to decide as a society how old someone should be before they start drinking, how it mean there's a lot of countries that let kids drink like responsibly with their parents when they're much younger than 21 and they have less incidents per capita of alcoholism than some of the countries that are more restrictive about it.

Speaker 5:          00:42:28       So I don't know who's right or who's wrong. I don't know. I know americans, You know, it's things that work other places, like we said before, don't work here. You know what? I remember going to Italy as a 16 year old school and the first thing we did was run to like a bodega and buy beer because you could. Because we were amerIcan kids and were dicks and you can have beer, so we didn't grow up responsibly so we weren't acting responsibly. We'd have to shift the whole way. Our culture is to make those things work. Right, and I don't know how to do that, but I know that weed is the easy problem to solve. Alcohol is a demon. That needs to be rooted out of our society. See, I disagree with you. I disagree with you. I enjoy alcohol. No, I do too.

Speaker 5:          00:43:07       but I mean like can put the block then. I mean just to see, like when we started having the conversation, when people say, let's compare it to alcohol, I start licking my chops because when you compare it to alcohol, alcohol is. Alcohol is poisonoUs. Idig drinking. I drank a lot, a lot all the time. Um, so I'm not saying you did say that though. You just misspoke. Misspelt don't. I don't mean pull it away. No, no, I understand. But let's not demonize marijuana compared to alcohol. No. Alcohol definitely ruins more people. It's definitely way worse for your body. it's definitely much more dangerous as far as like operating cars and, and behavior of the week. The foolish things that people do in their drinking. Yeah. All that stuff. There's a lot of stuff that's directly attributable to alcohol, but. So what, so what, you know, look, we've survived for so long with alcohol, it's the regulations have worked to at least to a manageable.

Speaker 5:          00:44:03       The fact that here's what You can't do, you can't stop people from doing what they want to do and not. ExacTly. And why is it that you could stop someone from doing that, but you can't stop them from practicing doing flips and bmx bikes. Right? What would you. Can you know? Is it because they're there? They're driving and injuring other people will then take away their right to drive. Like that's how we have it set up though. They're injuring people getting in fightS. What do you lock them in jail yet? But the rest of the people

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       leave us alone. yeah, we should have the right to choose too many fucking rights. We can control our own consciousness. You can control what we put in our bodies and here's most important concept. We're all just people. They're all just people to like. you can call them the government. You can call them the police. You can come the dea. There are a bunch of fucking people. That's all they are. When you go behind some big crazy name, like it's say fbi open up. People go, oh shit. It's the fbi. If you go, it's mike and steve and bob and we want to see what kind of plants are growing. Right? Open up, but who the fuck are you guys? You guys are just some fucking people. So when you write something down on paper, this is how archaic our our world is. you write something down on paper that decreased power to these regular people, so these regular people the sudden have the right to fucking shit.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       Storm your house, kIck open your door, shoot your dog because you have a bag of pot hidden in your fucking bureau drawer. This is the world we create is this is the. This is a real world and more people get killed during those rates. Then pat would ever kill. That's for sure. It doesn't kill anybody. That's the most ridiculous thing that they did. Notice. Still zero, zero ever man. TheY would be parading in front of us every now and then like the mirror in the uk or one of those fake newspapers will put. A young man dies on marijuana. First known case, but it's not true. It's not true. He can't. It doesn't kill you. It's not toxic. It might fuck your head up, fuck your head up, but you should be allowed to make that choice. I'm going to fuck my head up. Yeah, and if you're abusing it than the people around you will help you or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       You know, whatever needs to be done to just like monster energy drinks. I know people who drink those things all day long and look, I love the way those fucking things taste and if you want to stay awake and you're like, fuck it, we're going in. THat is the way to go, but you're not supposed to drink like 10 of them in a day. That dude needs an intervention. Some people are crazy. They'll drink 10 of those giant red bulls. The big red bull, you know when they started making red bull like a beer can now will a bud tall boy. People that drink those all day. It's mostly people that have alcohol problems that I would want to go to. Hey, they could switch to caffeine. So I was like 20 coffees a day for some of these guys. I went to the hospital because of those energy drinks from heartbeat, palpitations and stuff like, oh yeah man, well, you know, they're great if you want one, you know, and monsters probably actually like less caffeine and some of them bad monster.

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       And the monster is one of the better ones. The better tasting one's the worst one that I ever tried as far as like the jolt that it gives you is that red line shit you remember. That was it. Uh, when I went to the hospital was the mountain. They don't even make that any became illegal. Red line is what's red hair? It was scary. It was like can and in that kim was like 50 doses and you went down the whole thing, but it was um, see if he could find it. How safer those five hour energy drinks. I chose a pretty safe. It's pretty safe. Those are mostly vitamin 12, right?

Speaker 5:          00:47:29       They only have a, I want to say like 70 milligrams of caffeine, a cup of coffee, a cup of coffee. So they're safe. I don't feel the same drink in that as I do at red bull. No, I like it. It's better. I like those be 12 drinks. I think b, 12 drinks are way better caffeine. Two hundred 50 milligrams of caffeine. That doesn't seem like that much. It doesn't. Just what? That's not an eight ounce bottle either. ThAt is, it says it says per a fluid ounce bottle. Coffee. Like if coffee is 50 milligrams and the thInking of the wrong shit. I swear I thought it was red line. Maybe I'm just wrong about the, the uh, the sheer volume of caffeine and that thing, but I thought it was just like ridiculous. But anyway, I, I drank it. Whatever it was, it was this one or the other one that's like, it that I mistake the name for it, but it says starbucks and I remember thinking, dude, I am just way too jacked up right now.

Speaker 5:          00:48:22       Starbucks, heavy caffeine. Yeah. I especially their cold brew, I get the, sometimes they get the trenta hold the fuck up. A 20 ounce, that's a trenta none. that's a venti. I get the one above that. They don't even have the numbers for that. But just saying a 20, a 20 ounce has 415 milligrams of caffeine in tacky cardia. Holy shIt. Is that real iced coffees more? I believe. Yo. Look at this. Decaf has 30 milligrams. Yeah. The fuck is that decaf alWays has a level. No, but 30 milligram. I thought it was like five or something. I thought it was like trace amounts to see what the ice coffee is. I believe it's a lot more really. I get the trent usually. How is that possibLe? A cold brew cold brew. Three 30 where I guess it's not more, but I get the trend diversion, so that's probably more.

Speaker 5:          00:49:14       Yeah. They can't keep serving you like that. They're going to have to have to pull back. See, that's the thing is, is I agree, but then my libertarian side doesn't agree. Why do you think you should drink that shit all day if you want. Of course, my friend dave foley used to drink pots of coffee pot. like all day he'd drink pots of coffee. He had to stop putting cream in because he realized he was drinking a quart of ice cream a day. I think of that every time I put cream in my coffee, I think of your stories telling me about that court cream just from coffee. yeah. I like that. Fresh heady cream. I constantly. That's what I'm talking about a year, like a dark roast hawaiian coffee with some heavy cream motherfucker. You gonna make me feel good. That's what cool that starbucks is now doing that they're doing with their cold brew coffee. they have like a heavy cream that's like karma or something. They mixed through it. Nice. Yeah. It's the cigarettes and coffee thing or the staples of the alcoholics, right? Yeah. A lot of people enjoy those cigarettes and they enjoy those, uh, those coffees. But you know, guys. Yeah. But, but in their eyes they feel like they've got the alcohol part under wraps now because this stuff just kind of keeps them going and this stuff is not ruining their life. Right. I get it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:30       A lot of alcohol. She used cannabis the same way. Um, and uh, that's not really accepted by aa. so I know a lot, a lot of people who have, um, kicked their alcoholism by moving more towards cannabis, but again, uh, within the gay community that they don't like that, that's still considered a drug. So, but you can get a degree

Speaker 5:          00:50:51       good to anything, you know, whether it's porn or big macs or where we can get it a psychologically addicted to anything. But jamie didn't. The guy who created alcoholics anonymous, didn't you have positive experiences with lsd? That'd be funny. That would be like, I feel like you did assets. The only thing you're allowed to take guys. Well I feel like I feel like that was something that happened like maybe even a after. Well I don't want to speak out of school. Yeah, my right. Yeah. Hold on. Yeah. So what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       Well that's why the government needs testing on, on a lot of things. So we know.

Speaker 5:          00:51:32       Scroll that up please. Alcoholics anonymous for a founder believed lsd could cure alcoholism. Wow. Well you've seen so much research now in psychedelics that clinics are opening up. There's a clinic in, in la for, for cattlemen, you know, and you're seeing mda clinics opening up this, what most of them do not realize that the program's co founder, bill wilson, credited the psychedelic drugs, lsd for alleviating his alcoholism and believe the drug could be used to treat others as well. Holy shit. So those friends of bill, they didn't get all the information. It's just kind of like friends of bill, if you're in the alcoholics anonymous, right? That's what they call themselves, like friends of bill. It's like the cold war, but they didn't get that experience. It's kind of like the mushrooms that quitting cigarettes do, but do you think they tell them, I never heard this before today.

Speaker 5:          00:52:24       How could you not tell these people? Wilson first became big, began experimenting with lsd in los angeles at the veterans administration back in 1956. But after taking his first hit of acid, he realized that it was not the aspect of terror that could help remedy alcoholism, but rather the insight one could obtain from stepping into a world of simulated insanity. Willow wilSon believed that using the lsd could help. The alcoholic discover a power greater than ourselves that in turn could restore us to sanity. However, he was adamant that using acid to combat the demons of alcoholism was not something that he could, that one could expect from a single dose. Like more research is required and snacks. Wow. Hmm. That's interesting man. That's interesting. Yeah. Psychedelics, I think as we experiment with them medically are gonna reveal some secrets. Skies skys a heavy duty tripper. They're going further down.

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       He was tripping with aldous huxley. Like this guy. This isn't like one experience you had interesting. There's documentation that indicates wilson was involved with many supervise lsd trials, including someone's psychology psychologist, betty eisner and brave new world author, aldous huxley, which led him to believe that the visions and insights given by lsd could create a large incentive, at least in a considerable number of people, was with like a leader and in fact they live left this out of the a pamphlet. How do they. How could they leave this out? It's crazy because it seems like this had to play a major part in this guy's ability to kick alcohol.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       Well, it seems like at every major religion also left out the psychedelics that probably created them as well. So I, I think, uh, you know, you have, I think a lot of times you got to leave out the stuff that you think people aren't going to follow you for.

Speaker 4:          00:54:23       Wait a minute, you've seen alcoholics anonymous, has a religion. So what you just said, call you son of a bitch. I can't even believe you, gina. I thought we were friends. That is um, that is really wild, man. That's really interesting stuff. But it totally, it totally makes sense that it could help you a kick in addiction. That totally makes sense because the stark contrast between being intoxicated on it and what it feels like to be normal and this rethinking like a reset button. That's what all the psychedelics provide. That's really beneficial. Besides being fun. They all provide that reset that takes you so far out of who you are right now that when you come back, you go, man, am I doing this the right way? Right? You know, now that I'm back to sober reality, do I need to refocus this connection from your own ego? Yeah, probably good idea.

Speaker 2:          00:55:11       You know, and yeah, you have the organization maps. I had the guy from maps on the podcast who's that does the psychedelic research. Um, uh, I forgot what doblin? Uh, yes. Uh, so, so just recently he, they, they got um, uh, authorized from the federal government to start doing research on cannabis for the first time that federal federal ban was lifted. And it was because because of maps, uh, that they, they were able to get that they were the first ones granted that, that federal research on cannabis. So, um, so it, it's in, in very similar ways. We need to do research on lsd. We need to do research on psilocybin because there could be medical effects that just like cannabis were just denying because of years of, um, you know, this is the way it was. They're bad. They're bad.

Speaker 4:          00:56:06       Jamie put that back up. That quote about, bill, this is crazy. look at this. It says a. unfortunately, lsd made its way into the rooms of alcoholics anonymous. Simply because others in a hierarchy hierarchy hierarchy did not support it as a viable treatment. In fact, a document published in 1984 by alcoholics anonymous world services in New York explained that the reason the program does not endorse the use of lsd as word of bill's activity, this is all in quotes. As word of bill's activitiEs reached the fellowship, there were inevitable repercussions. Most aes were violently opposed to his experimenting with a mind altering substance. Lsd was then totally unfamiliar, poorly researched, and entirely experimental dot, dot, dot, and bill was taking it and quote, I wonder, pills there was scared. They were all scared that this guy was tripping. That's hilarious. So they didn't want to include it even though the founder of the program found it massively beneficial and it's almost ironic that that trying to put it in there and they kicked him out basically. Really. Whereas this apparent resistance to step down, I was chastised for. Wow, that's hilarious. Isn't that crazy? Because timothy, well, terrence mckenna attributed this quote that timothy leary, but timothy leary said he never said it, so nobody knows exactly who said it, but that lsd causes violent reactions to people who have never tried it. What? Good.

Speaker 8:          00:57:35       YeAh. Very interesting. The people that haven't tried it are the ones that are not the people who were on it. Right. Do you think lsd though for real, can solve anything? I. I've done it maybe over 200 times and you might not be the best example when you were taking it 200 times. A lot of that was recreational, not, but I'm sure there was small little things that I was probably going through that I could have used lsd to help me. Like I like as an example, I took lsd once after a big breakup. Did it help me get through that breakup? no. it did nothing for my breakup, you know? Or were you trading on it to try to use it that way? Or that's the thing. It's also going to go with your own intention probably, and it's not. It doesn't work for you. It's not like, hey, clean up my life. I'm going to take some acid just right. no, you got to do the work yourself. I just don't see it

Speaker 4:          00:58:31       presents what it will. All these psychedelics, like the good experiences, the bad experiences represent what's the state of mind when you go into them. That's why the people that take it really seriously and they go through this all meditative ritual and they'll do yoga, do breathing exercises and they'll set like a tone to whatever they would like to go into this experience with and say say that they're going into the experience open and humble and say all these things out loud and then they enter into the psychedelic trip. Like they do it that way because they, they want to set an intention. If you just broke up with a girl and you take asset, if you like, really think about it.

Speaker 8:          00:59:06       The exciting thing, because you didn't help me when I broke up my girl. Like that's really what you're saying. But you could also be like, hey, I want to quit smoking. Take acid. Being like, what happened? Did you quit smoking? And like, and I know I focused on cigarettes and then the whole place melted and in my hand turned into a bunch snakes. So no, I still went to. Again,

Speaker 1:          00:59:24       you don't really want to quit if you wanted to quit, you just quit. Right. But I don't think they asked the way. Has anything to do with it? Doesn't. It doesn't help you. It's not going to just decide for you. Like it depends on what's the intention that you go into taking any psychedelic, whether it's mushrooms or whatever. What's the intention that you go into this, this trip with and you can't think like acid doesn't work because it didn't help me quit smoking. Like you didn't help you quit smoking. Like these are decisions that you make?

Speaker 8:          00:59:50       Yeah, I, I just don't see how acid it. Unless it's really bad acid that will. You'll remember anything except melty stuff in the walls. Melting and lizards. I just don't see any kind of help on our lesser, lesser level. Do you feel like cannabis has changed your personality because you know that is something you might not go into st. Alright, I broke up with tonight, I'm going to smoke weed for it. But throughout your lifetime, has cannabis had an effect on you that you feel like it's changed your personality? I've been smoking since I was like 14, 15, so I don't even know what my personality was before, if anything. I think marijuana made me more paranoid and scared, you know, I was more freaked out and stuff. But as a medicine for headaches and I don't take almost any pills now. I don't have tylenol in my house anymore.

Speaker 8:          01:00:36       If I, if I have a headache I use weed. So for that it has helped me tremendously. But personality wise probably not. It probably made me more paranoid and awful as a person when smoking it because I'm, you know, I get panicky, you know, if I, if I'm super stoned in a room of people, it's not helping me at all. It's making it worse. If anything. What about you joe? And he started later, later that you know, you didn't start as a teenager. So do you feel like it's made a difference on who you are?

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       Yeah, it changes your perspective. It, uh, it offers you some, a different frequency of insight I would say. I think that, uh, one of the things that's done that's good is it, it, it makes me consider things that I might not be thinking about and uh, it, it gives you almost a deliminates areas of your consciousness that maybe you weren't paying attention to. It's mAde me a nicer guy. Like I'm kind of a type a high strung guy and like if there's an employee that I just want to strangle, I can take a hit of, of the no ga and suddenly be like, no. And he's, he's, he's all right. He's had a hard day. Exactly. Instead of accelerating that kind of behavior and shitty behavior, it definitely makes you more, more inclined towards fellowship and kindness. It's just a, it's a really good chemical, you know, it's a really good reaction that your mind has to this natural plant for creative reasons. One hundred percent definitely opens up a different pathway in your head. I like it for everything. I like it for a lot of different things. I like it but it. But for creative reasons, it's one of the best things. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 8:          01:02:10       sure. You know, a lot of are a celebrity patients that are, you know, working in comedy or music or

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       a television or the movies they want sativas specifically. So, um, they're not down at all because you sativas are more known for their creativity and things like that. So, so we find people who are working in the creative field, theY want to smoke sativas, you know, um, which is an important distinction between indicas and sativas pizza. A lot of people don't know that different parts of different types of marijuana can affect you differently, you know, and um, there are some people who were medicating for certain ailments while they should smoke something that specifically worked for those elements. If, um, if you're smoking because you're looking for creativity because you're looking for, um, that uh, um, you know, uh, you don't want to lay on the couch and go to sleep, then you should smoke, smoke sativas. Um, if you are looking for that, it's nighttime. I want to relax. Uh, you know, time to go to bed, you should smoke into cars because that's going to bring you down and give you that body high with, with, uh, the cbd chemical that's inside.

Speaker 5:          01:03:27       Got, that's what I want. I'm like, brian, I don't, I get, I get jumpy with steve. I get a little bit Freaked out, a little paranoid. Pussies move in together. Hey, I think we're neighbors actually are. Yeah, I know. Look, we've all been to high. No, everybody's been too high, you know. Um, one of the most famous scientists wasn't carl sagan. It was some other famous scientists. Uh, it was a theoretical mathematician, guys, the rights, all that crazy scribble shit. He would just, he would just talk about how he likes one hit. That's what he likes to take. Just one hit. Just go for a walk on these ideas would come to them. It's like you don't have to get fucking blasted, just one hit. That's why I was so against it at first is because I thought one hit made you really fucked up because that's how I saw gino. But it turned out, gina would say you were such a dick to me when I smoked weed in your house that I have to go outside, smoke a whole joint in two minutes and come in and be a mess. So that was what I was exposed to. It was, I don't want any of that. I didn't realize you could just take one hit and just chill out and still work and still function. Nobody knows. And it makes people nicer. The definitely does. It did it for me,

Speaker 2:          01:04:36       you know, uh, I think, um, you know, to say that, uh, what are the medical facts? What, what are you treating yourself for it? It's almost silly to say because everyone else who's not really treating themselves for a cancer or something like that, they are getting mood regulation out of it. So even if you wanT to call it recreational smoking, you're still getting mood regulation out of it. And those people who smoke it almost daily or whatever on whatever schedule they smoke it on, they might have, if they didn't, they might be on percocet, they might be on, you know, welbutrin and they might be on a million other other drugs. So to say that recreational use is people just getting high.

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       That's also also not accepting that people are looking for mood regulation as a medical effect. So we already have it with coffee. Yeah. Coffee, nicotine, booze. That's all business. There's so many different things. We already accept sugar. Well sugar is the scariest one. Yeah, that shit's everywhere. Once you start paying attention to it. But the Idea is that you should be able to do whatever you want. If you want to eat candy bars all day, that should be completely up to you. And that's not where we are, you know? And the fact that that's not where we were, where we are with one of the most beneficial plants the world's ever known because that's really what it is. Especially since it's connection to him. It's the most beneficial plant the world's ever known. And it's illegal. I mean, that doesn't show you how stupid people are.

Speaker 5:          01:06:08       I mean, we're so god damn goofy. We are and it's gonna. It's goNna get worse before it gets better, unfortunately. Think because the laws are such a mess right now. Listen, hillary clinton's gonna fix everything. She gets an offer. She's going to be great. She's always been a top shelf. Well, who Donald Trump? is he going to fix it? He doesn't. He. I don't think he cares. He cares. I know he doesn't care. I know that. Perfect. Thank you. With the legalized marijuana nationwide, I get a lot of stoller. Switch gears. Know what scares me. Is that what if he makes chris christie, the attorney general? That would be. It would be hilarious. It'd be so bad for my business, dude. Have you been? It'd be hilarious. That guy is not going to be the attorney general it. If he's not. The attorney general will take anybody with however you got so full.

Speaker 5:          01:06:53       He's so foolish. Has his opinions on marijuana while consuming copious amounts of sugar and public. they're so ridiculous. Ridiculous. He put a bag of m and m's inside is m and m's after, after he had stomach surgery. I mean it's a crazy person, so this guy is addicted to sugar. One hundred percent, but that's clear. So no way you stay that big unless you're eating terrible. That's just it. But he'll go with one thing is legal. One thing is not saying end of story. Who's an insane person, but that's what. That's what we're fighting with the city. Just this is the law. End of story. You get the chance. He can't even win the democratic side anymore. still voting for gary, man. Gary Johnson. You got Gary Johnson is a better. It's almost. Well it's a more likely vote than bernie at this point. I just don't think like physically he can win, but could happen though is he and hillary could team up and would be a formidable twosomes so great.

Speaker 5:          01:07:47       I think it'd be hillary and then he would be the vice president. I can be crazy though. That's so left. If they said any nancy shit to each other. It's kind of. That's where it gets. Yeah, you got it. You got to curb your words when you're running, right. You've got to make sure that you don't get to negatives so that you could join forces. Would they put a socialist on the ticket in the United States of America? While it's democratic socialist, it's not entirely like a socialist to beat trump. I think they might be tricky. It's tricky. It's tricky, but he does have the support of the youth. You know, he's, he's got people fired up socially. You know, he sits down with people like killer mike and as long term interviews. you know, he's interesting. He's an interesting. He's different. He doesn't accept money from. I look, I like a lot of what he stands for.

Speaker 5:          01:08:30       I think half of it. I liked him way better than I like her. I'm not a big fan of the whole, like long term politicians. I'm not a big fan of those kind of people. There just seems like You just have too many compromises along the way. There's too much lIke weaving in and out of the system in the morning and toys in the system. The more suspicious we should all be. She's way more intertwined in the system, of course, but here's an example. I'm speed. We'd shut down by proposition day, which was written by a lawyer who represents a bunch of dispensaries that are predicted by proposition day. Those are some dots you can connect them. So an attorney writes a law that protects his clients and it gets passed. How does that happen? I don't know, but I know the career politicians don't make things better for us. Yeah. They only do if it's the will of the people in the ceiling where they could stay in office, but usually it's not really just the will of the people. It's people aren't really paying attention because the goal of these corporations, they get involved or donate your money and the people don't even know what the fuck is happening while it's happening. That's right.

Speaker 2:          01:09:31       Well, that's what we have. Exactly. Exactly. Going on here. You know, there's a lot of those laws, right? Yeah. Well, we were dealing with a lot of them, you know, again, to say that um, you know, business had to be in operation before 2007 in order to be considered a, you know, now to be a viable business. Well, if you were in operation in 2007, you learn in that wild west category. So, so you were already skating that line. Do you want the players that were bad players involved or do you want good companies that want to put in a standing, a standard operating procedures that are looking for best practices? Why wouldn't you want companies like that? You know, we just laid off 40 people

Speaker 5:          01:10:15       well that are now in unemployment. 40 good people that really can't get decent jobs anywhere that we're paid well above minimum wage are now just laid off and going on the government dollar because it's because of this law that nobody knows about and nobody read.

Speaker 2:          01:10:30       You know? And, and for us, it came at a time where we, we were so excited about the future of working with the board of equalization. We were in, in our largest expansion at the time, um, we were going from the largest market which was la to expanding throughout all of California, which we're still doing that, but we just now have to not include la, which was our main base.

Speaker 5:          01:10:56       So in the law, what the law pertains to is you delivering things to people that live in homes because that home has not been cleared because as a place to do business, because it, because of the zoning law, only these 135 pre ico is allowed to

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       operate at all within the city. Nobody else can join the club. It's only that 1:35. And any marijuana wanna vehicle is an extension of the marijuana business. So every car is zoned like a building.

Speaker 4:          01:11:27       So essentially they've limited the number of stores that can operate the number of dispensaries. And you guys got pushed out because you didn't have a grandfathered in.

Speaker 2:          01:11:37       Well that, that's, that's number one. But number two is our base. Where our business is, is not in the city limits of la. So by normal law for any other business, you follow the laws of the municipality in, we just convey through the streets of la and there's a law on the California books that says you can't stop someone if your business is not in one municipality and you drive to another municipality to deliver something. You can't stop that. So we're not even in la and we have to have to deal with this. We're outside the city of la because the city of la encompasses hollywood and and a lot of la, but they're in places that people think are la, like beverly hills or west hollywood. Those are in la. Lawsuit

Speaker 3:          01:12:23       says we're operating a sophisticated delivery company running seven, about seven hubs out of the la, out of the la area. It's like, well, where are the addresses on the lawsuit? There are none because we don't have any locations inside the city. We don't roll orders out of there, but it's not in the paperwork. Just so

Speaker 4:          01:12:43       goofy though. This is what's the problem? This is the scary problem with big government. This is the problem with government that just has too many regulations, too much red tape and too much bullshit stuff like this

Speaker 2:          01:12:54       and there should be a balance of harm to our company, uh, that, that, um, is trying to work within every regulation of California working with the state to create them, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:13:07       Well, let me ask you this, when is it going to be legal? Is it an on the books to be in november to november, november? Yes. Well, we have to organize like this is an important thing for the future of mankind. It is, must be done there and unfortunately there's even infighting within the cannabis industry. Yeah. Well, you know what the problem that I ran into when we were talking about the, uh, the legalization vote, the growers didn't want it to be legal because they would make less money or of course you guys are growing illegally. And I was like, wow. And he's like, hey man, I'm just telling you the truth, but where we're at

Speaker 2:          01:13:42       point now that if we don't do that, they're going to get pushed out anyway by bigger corporations that will come in and be able to pay millions of dollars for licensing and buildings and things like that.

Speaker 4:          01:13:52       People are greedy and they're shortsighted. You can't be greedy. You can't be shortsighted. You can. This is a, this is a global issue. And in these environments where these people are saying, we're going to, we're going to make less money. Bullshit expand. It's going to be legal now. Dummy. Like, yeah, you're going to have competition. so fucking they were making money.

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       Why do you care if other people are making money while you're concentrating on that? Just just enjoy life. You're gonna have a bunch of potheads mIllionaires around. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:14:18       right. And you know, along those lines, as we were cultivating for our own patient base, we were filed. We follow the California a. The law is for California. The cultivate. Once a local licensing started becoming possible for cultivation. It wasn't before, uh, the governor sign this bill last year. Now it's becoming possible we went out and we are now participating with desert hot springs for illegal cultivation, so it's going to be a place where the police could come in, the government could come in and inspect it. So, so we're moving forward with full legalization on cultivation is as well paying, paying everything you got to pay for making sure that you, uh, your, when you build your building, it's built to the right specs again, the governments involved in every part of it. So again, we're moving forward with the regulations, even though it's gonna cost us a lot of money aren't, you know, the investment team that's behind it has already put $2,000,000 in just to buy the property, you know, so, um, it's gonna cost a lot of money and we're not, you're not going to make the money, you know, millions of dollars that you're hoping for, but at least you're doing it in a way that can be regulated and you can open up your doors and not hide.

Speaker 2:          01:15:44       Because we don't want to hide everything we've ever done. We haven't hidden. We've said everything in the media. Hey, we're following regulations, we're, we're trying to do everything the right way. We're paying, paying, paying the taxes. We have to pay where we're working.

Speaker 3:          01:15:58       Well, that's why we got sued is because if you sue speed weed that gets your name in the paper, you see the display, you know the delivery that one of the other 400 delivery services that you can find operating right now today that are illegal, that's not going to get your name in the paper in an election year. Maybe It's a conspiracy theory, but all of the facts in our case are dated 2014. We got served in 2016. I don't know. Is this a special year to politicians? Maybe it's a special year. Hold on for a second. So there are certain delivery companies that are allowed to operate inside lno. Nobody's allowed, no one that they are what they are, but they do 400. The do 400 illegal ones. Well, they're all podcasts, golden snitches. So we're going to start doing overnight delivery with medical carriers to the entire state.

Speaker 3:          01:16:48       So speed we'd will deliver it to anywhere in California. That's allowed not inside the city limits of la, but outside the city limits. You're in fresno, you were in sacramento or wherever you are, a patient meet you at the border of taco stand at the border and you make a hand off certain patients. Maybe burbank in la. Burbank is nike's not, not in la. Oh, so I can still get delivery. You could until the. Until they tell the delivery services to stop. But burbank does not like the industry. Just like glendale and pasadena do not like the industry was that there's, it's, it's the propaganda machine and it's, it's, you know, law enforcement shows up. IT's the city hall and start screaming about if you have a dispensary is going to have crime. Delivery's going to be a lot of cash or product in the cars.

Speaker 3:          01:17:35       you're bringing crime. And they frightened the city council and the people that vote in saying, all right, so we don't want it here. So leT let it happen in echo park where the hippies live. We're here in burbank with, you know, with this, the studios, we don't want it in the studios. I would want it because so many of the actors or private app, we'd, I need it to live. They do, they do. They've delivered all like on movie sets. Yeah. That of course they do. Everybody knows roles that people play probably have to be as you fucking do it. I Wonder if Daniel Day lewis smokes weed. Fuck yeah. Does we can talk about, uh, uh, privacy of certain patients we try and say they're trying to say anything. I'm saying a lot of the actors you, you would think are smoking weed while they were acting.

Speaker 3:          01:18:19       They are interesting. Of course they are. Whereas here, I know several who don't have to name names, but I know a lot of people get super high as fuck right before the do a scene. Sure. Kind of makes sense. Uh, you know, uh, I mean you've introduced me to some, so certainly certainly, you know, um, and uh, they're just as many that you would never suspect that that guy is a everyday smoker and they are. And um, and that's because you know, there's still stigma and when you're living in a public life you need privacy. And that's one of the reasons you need delivery because some of my, my patient basis, if they walk into a dispensary, they're gonna lose endorsements and sponsor money from [inaudible]. They're on family shows, things like that. Well, how is that fair to them? They need their Medication. They need safe access to their medication.

Speaker 3:          01:19:12       They can't. You're saying it all granted they're trying to get high to settle the fuck down. I know they need their medication. They're dying. We ask them. We have to protect it to him quickly. Our disney kids toys, one of society's seep deep into his brains. Joe, have you been to a denver yet? Since? Uh, since then, since illegal. I was just there like four months ago, five months ago, something like that. She's just walking down the street. Just walk into anything. Pop places everywhere. They're all over the place. Did. So it's like amsterdam. It's like some weird new american amsterdam. And there's so much money in real estate. Prices are skyrocketing. Real estate prices are up 19 percent. How's the prices like, like it's just say like a joint in, in denver or you have any idea? It's, it's, it's more expensive thAn it is here, and they do have different pricing for medical as they do for recreation. And we went over that with taxes is 39 percent taxes versus think like nine.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       Um, however, uh, you know, I've been there plenty of times and, and the weed here in southern California, it's still past that I've seen possible. It seems like denver would have the best climate ever getting it needs to fucking relax on those big dick measuring competition between slates and we were in pittsburgh. No, we were in philly and we got high with this do to the radio station. Gave us a joint and we were like some philly, we'd, I'll just smoke the fuck out. His fellow isn't going to do shit. And like 20 minutes later we were like, dude, we made a mistake. PhIlly we'd is legit. I think there's an answer to that though, is that the best weed in Colorado is still black market. Um, so maybe. But he's so fuckIng strong. You guys are crazy talk. This is, you're talking for the deepest of the deep and the deep end of the pool.

Speaker 1:          01:21:03       That's what you're talking all the pot, whether it's Colorado or California, we'll put you on fucking pluto. All of it. No, no doubt. And the difference between two hits of Colorado pot, two hits of California pot is if you can measure that, write a book at the end. It's the joy you had. Like what if you had like three joints? Those were just the three shittiest joints in color. I don't buy it. Colorado. I was in Colorado. I had some other weed. I'll be there thursday. Fucking ridiculous. It's like it's super weed. It's all the same shit. All these strains have gotten everywhere. You know, they're all over the country. They have this shit in New York now. Does the. We do get hired because of the elevation for weed? Yeah. You have no air. So it's probably just shitty weed. No, no, no. The alcohol gets too drunk or too. That's a big one. But uh, it's, it's just, it's just good. We're great. It's everywhere.

Speaker 1:          01:21:56       It's because of social media. It's becoming to a point where you just can't deny it. I thought we were aLready there. We're very close to it. And as I'm politicians get older and pushed out and younger politicians get in, the toothpaste is out of the tube, it's not going backwards. So, uh, you know, for la to be behind the times of the rest of the state and for California, the most progressive state in the country to be behind the times of states like Colorado and Alaska who were making, making tax money. It's the money, the money and the politics is too. It's too intertwined. It's too, it's part of the fabric of our society and it's broken, you know, it is. And hopefully iT's going to be eventually pushed out. But right now, you know, you have to deal with one of the most ridiculous examples of it, which is marijuana. It's one of the most ridiculous examples of all sorts of problems that I'm sure all sorts of businesses run into all across the country that we don't consider because it doesn't play a part in our lives. But this one does. And this one is really a nationwide freedom issue. I mean, that's really what a lot of is about. It's a freedom of consciousness issue.

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       And people don't look at it like that. They will get it. Like it's law enforcement, it's this, it's crime, it's this, it's children, it's this, no, it's not what it is. It's a freedom of social consciousness. It's a freedom of being able to express yourself and the freedom of being able to intoxicate yourself with a natural plant and then what comes out of that. And that's what everybody was worried about more than anything in the 19 seventies, what they were worried about. And then a sixties and the seventies is what was coming out of this. They weren't worried about the consequences of taking this drug. They were worried about what's coming out of this. You're geTting all these people that just won't tolerate all the usual standard shit because they're constantly resetting themselves and then reconsidering their environment and they're coming out with this whole new movement of people like all the haight ashbury shit and the sixties and you know, all the, the music of the time.

Speaker 4:          01:24:00       So much of That had to do with pot and so much of that has to do with lsd. Sure. And they were just terrified of that shit. They will work when we talk about the war on drugs and people blame nancy reagan that started with nixon, you know, in the late sixties, early seventies. And now the new stuff has come out. I'm sure you've seen it where they're saying the nixon administration purposely targeted marijuana because they were really going after the civil rights leaders and the people that were anti war movement. Yes. So they would go arrest them through pot and that would be the get the back door to just break up these organizations and that this was a strategy they had

Speaker 2:          01:24:32       to the point that they asked a universities to pull cannabis information that was positive. Um, I, I mean, that's.

Speaker 4:          01:24:40       Yeah, they do. They funded studies trying to find things wrong with pot and they all, all they found was good shit. The donald tash can study is one that I love where he was that study was to find the connection between lung cancer and smoking cannabis. And it turned out he could find no connection. It actually showed that there could be a, a, a protective effect of cannabis. That's how I'm still alive. Maybe a lot of people like you that smoke cigarettes and smoke pot. It might actually even started the same time.

Speaker 2:          01:25:07       NO, I haven't. I have a patient with double lung transplant. He had a fiber myalgia and myalgia. Uh, so that's double lung transplant. Uh, we were doIng an interview with, uh, with, with a magazine and I had him there and he showed I take these 45 pills a day for four, you know, what I have or I could eat these three edibles and um, he's like 45 pills a day. It's crazy just trying to swallow them. Um, and. But he said these cost me thousands of dollars, however I don't pay for them because it's paid by insurance. These I pay almost 45, $50 a day in edibles and, and I could just eat those instead. However, none of this is paid for it. And I don't have the money to pay $50 a day for my medication. So he's one of the patients that we help out with with a free product and um, you know, because he can't afford It

Speaker 5:          01:26:08       to live pharmaceutical side of the, of this conversation is just, that's a whole nother side of it is very nice of you to give that to him by the way. But hearing that he's eaten $45 or the edibles day makes me want to shit my pants and scary. What kind of a tornado of consciousness, this guy flying around in all day, how many milligrams we talking for 45 bucks worth of weed. How many milligrams is this motherfucker taking in? You know, you have no lungs. You take whatever you need to do to get through that day. Oh yeah, we know for sure. But I'm thinking $45 where the chiba chews would put you in another dimension. Come on time. There's a shit hacky sack.

Speaker 2:          01:26:48       We're talking somewhere around 500 milligrams a day. Um, so, so it's not tremendous. I mean, I've seen joey diaz he a thousand dollars

Speaker 5:          01:26:56       right time saying, but if he's getting cheaper, choose like chiba chews, which are like a really potent, an easy way to get them. 40th five bucks is not 500 milligrams. You can give one 500 milligram one for a lot less than that, right? For 15 bucks. So spend 45 bucks and he's buying the good shit. Jesus louisa's, he might be on a five, 500 milligram chiba chew a day diet. I want to meet this student's shake his hand. That's a piece of pioneer. Pioneer live in that world. That's a good man. Good man to know. Whatever. Don't be a pussy. All of a sudden you're worried about sugar. This fucking guys living in an alternate dimension. These are looking at us through a fucking aquarium window. Like he's. He's not even here if he's eating that much pot. You're talking about that much, that many milligrams and then it's getting processed. So you gotta think about it way stronger than just smoking it, right? It is. I mean, I went, I had a bad edible strip and I went five years without even touching it, even though we had him on the menu, I was like, dude, I w I wouldn't even want to smell one of those tootsie rolls or whatever the hell it is. I didn't want nothing to do with it because I was in another place for like two days. Hi, just going, when is it going to end? I mean, we started this

Speaker 2:          01:28:10       an edibles company before, before we were speed weed and we were one of the first. We were the first company to do gummy bears and um, when we were making them, um, you know, my brother and my partner with, with his wife, jan also has figured out a way to extract, um, extract thc from, from weed. This is six years ago before anyone was doing it because we had a failed crop. Um, because when I moved to California, we got our cards. I said, I'm just going to throw up a grow and now I'm allowed to grow here.

Speaker 5:          01:28:44       I'm going to throw up a grow. Ever heard that I need to start saying shit like that. Get to go with my friends. So agent said, that's great. Where are we going to do it? I said I'm going to do it in your living room. So I took over his living room with tents and I put up grown and I think and since I going back and forth to

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       New York selling my house, I'm a every two weeks he was watching it while I was gone. Well it was

Speaker 5:          01:29:08       disaster. It was the worst experience were growing pot with all of our money. And I'm on the phone with gina going, you know, the leaves are yellow. He's like, all right, are the veins, read them and what do I don't know what we're talking about because It needs more responsible motherfucker. You can't just leave this dude with your plans. He's like, go, go get more nitrogen. I'm like, hi baby. For me, take my baby. Just feed it when it cries. So I, I got, I got

Speaker 2:          01:29:32       back from, from a trip late leading into my, my, uh, a growth cycle and I opened it up and you see webs, well those aren't spiders, those are spider mites and that's the worst thing you could ever, ever get. I grew in Ohio last, my whole entire crop spit like months growing, this scared of helicopters with a heat seeking thing and all our money was sunk into this, um, you know, all of a four months time to make it happen. And I was just defeated. I was like, I can't believe it. What are we gonna do? And so we, we had the fight it to fight those spider mites. We did everything we could, including buying 10,000 ladybugs which eat these things and releasing them in this tent. A foot from where I'm sleeping on his couch.

Speaker 5:          01:30:16       I bought them on amazon. I bought like a zillion lady bugs on amazon. We just released them into my living room. Yeah, we buy them all the time. Yeah. They didn't even do a bunch of different plants that are girls. So we bought ladybugs.

Speaker 2:          01:30:28       Yeah. And they worked. But they didn't exactly work fast enough and they were dying because we're. And uh, so we had to get predator mites, which were other little creepy crawly things that we had to release right where I was sleeping. So we released it. It was, it, it's exactly what it was.

Speaker 5:          01:30:45       It was like, if you could look at it under a microscope, it would be alert, some sort of a fucking storm troopers, starship troopers,

Speaker 2:          01:30:52       you know, a lord of the rings. Things were flying down, eating each other things with crime and up. And they were like, so what happened? What's the long story? So, so, so we got rid of them and had had bad weed. We extracted it, had re read some papers online. We extract and I said, what are we going to do with this? And we said, all right, let's make some edibles. So his wife,

Speaker 5:          01:31:10       so hold on, it's bad. Weed, bad. We'd consider it because you can't smoke it. Yeah. But you can still turn into edibles. It, it looked like shit out of, out of the litter box. It was garbage bin geno's like fuck it, I'm smoking it mode. I'm confused. Explain like why did it look bad? Because the mites chewed it up. Like what?

Speaker 2:          01:31:28       Yeah, a lady bug with a lady bug wings. Here's the thing. Really. So, so there's also things called neem oil, which is a natural pesticide that that also helps in killing, killing these things. However, in a growth cycle you shouldn't use it near the end because then it's going to be on the flowers that you have to smoke. However, if you extract the thc out of it, it's no longer on that plant material. You're getting rid of the plant material. The neem oil that's on it won't translate into an excel.

Speaker 5:          01:31:56       Oh, okay. So you use the pesticide unfortunately,

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       late in the cycle and it made the pot bad to smoke, but you can still extract the thc from. Right, right. It's a natural oil. I, I, it, it, it works as a pesticide. But I was so baffled. I was like, how is it bad weed? And then it's good weed. So, so bad. We'd good gummy bears. Yeah. So. Oh, so I started going, what is the process of extracting thc from the flowers? It's like breaking bad. Is that it? Yeah. My kitchen looked like a meth lab for like three months is crazy. We had a sox. Lydia, you had to have you done this before where you were experimenting? Did you watch a youtube video? I had no idea it even existed. I found a paper from like 1976 or ucla scientists that multi solvent extraction academy. Middle age. You can find it online now. Like this is a how to manual and how to do extraction. Okay. Hold on. Neither one of you guys are scientists. We're technology guys. I got scientists, right? I know I got married. No, I'm techie at homework. Had you ever done any chemical work like that? Using solvents and extracting l elements from plants? Not professionally.

Speaker 2:          01:33:04       He age is humble. He, he's a, he's a member of mensa. Uh, I got very blessed to have a brother who's very intelligent, um, you know, so I was just defeated, you know, I got a bad crop. I wasted all oUr money. I wasted our time. He turned lemons into lemonade because luckily he's smart enough to say what else can we do with this? And he went out and found a way for us to.

Speaker 3:          01:33:30       Did you practice or do you just dive right in? Would you do this? I hadn't. It was like a six week r and d process. So. So we did the extraction through with, uh, all kinds of different chemicals, right? Ultimately ethanol worked really well and then every night at 11 I would give gino a dose, like on a cookie or something at 11 and then I would wait 45 minutes in a mocked up in your basement to pretty much keep it rubs the lotion on skin every night. And then finally one day I give gina the dose, 1145, is that how you feel? He goes, I don't think it's working. I was like, boom, that's it. That's the recipe. And it's in my journal. And that was kind of how we got into the industry was with that extraction process, that recipe, that day. Now I've always wondered like this, when you use all those chemicals and you extract something from a plant or those chemicals in any way, is there a residue on the extraction?

Speaker 3:          01:34:24       Depends. We were using ethanol which is alcohol, but then we were making candy which burns off the alcohol, so there's no alcohol in the candy, but now you have the thc which is inside the candy and now you can and now we would. We would do car box relating the flower before anybody was doing that and what that means is you activate the flower, like you can't just take bud and eat it and get stoned. It won't work. Why is that? Because you need something fat soluble. You need to convert it to thc acid. So you do that with heat, so you smoke it or you do that with fat

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       like lipids. You boil it and butter. Make brownies, so fuck. Did people figure that out? It's brilliant. It's genius. Or you could do it with alcohol and that's ultimately what we'll use is alcohol extracts. Butane works as well, but what I mean is how the fuck did people figure out that you had to burn it in order to use it because they're probably eating it long before they knew I could get your high. Well, I mean it civilizations amazing. Like how did they figure out if we eat this route? Iowasca works, but otherwise or nut trees doesn't, you know, the trees told us that was probably true. They use tobacco in those iowasca rituals apparently. Right. We're right before you go onto their blow tobacco smoke on your face and was just to get you ready to vomit. Well, I don't even know if it's that.

Speaker 4:          01:35:43       I think it's a stimulating effect of the nicotine has some sort of a kickstart like terence mckenna, when he would take mushrooms, what he would do is he would take them and then you would wait. They kick in like an hour or so. So while he was waiting for them to kick in, he was just rolled joints as motherfuck would roll joints for an hour and then and then go and start going and when the pot really kicked in, like when he would get really, really high, that would be right when the mushrooms had come in like a giant tidal wave and he said he could see it coming, he could see it coming, you could feel it in the ground and it seemed like there's no way no one else is experiencing this. It's just like this gigantic wave is coming and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

Speaker 4:          01:36:27       And that's how he would do it. So he would use marijuana smoke, just sort of instigate the, uh, the mushroom experience, which totally makes sense. But that's a warrior that it will do that kind of experimentation dive dude, when deep healing deep, he went deep, maybe two months. She died of a brain cancer, a brain tumor. I mean, who knows if that was hereditary, who knows what that was, you know, it related in a way to expanding consciousness. We're attempting to expand in consciousness through drugs, most likely, not especially, but he was really critical of the idea that marijuana was cure a cure for cancer because he was like, look, I am telling you I have cancer and I smoked pot all day constantly. He's like, I am yoUr poster boy, because if it was something that cured cancer, I would not have cancer because you cannot smoke more pot than me. Like mckenna was just high all day. But there's so many different cancers and so many different types of weed. Who knows what's what. We got to research. Well, I think what's really supposed to be the most effectIve and chino you help my friend when he, uh, his mom had an Issue with this and this is something about genome who'd never advertised himself, but he hooked my friend up with a lot of this cannabis oil. What's really expensive stuff and you did it just to help his mom, but just to help his dad rather.

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       Well, he's a good dude. And uh, you know, we were talking about stage four cancer at that point. So there wasn't much a ever hope that it was going to turn around and cure it. However, to ease the last few months of life, um, was, was working and happening there, there was a lot more quality of life, which for the patient that, that was great, number one, absolute most important, but also for our, our friend that we're talking about, it was great for him because he got the last few months of life together with his loved one in a better way, not in a comatose a setting, which he was dealing with for a while before we got got, uh, you know, uh, on the, uh, rick simpson oil regimen.

Speaker 4:          01:38:37       Well, it definitely needs to be investigAted because there's so many people that have had beneficial effects from it. It just seems insane to not have some large scale scientific research being done right now. Like just humanity as a whole. Like we kind of owe it to each other. Like if you, you're not thinking about it right now because your loved ones don't have cancer. But if this turns out to be really legit, this could be another reason why we need to reconsider this whole ban on the illegal sale federally of marijuana. It's ridiculous if it can do this. If you really taking this oil and you're reduce reducing tumors, which has been reported in just a shitload of people, including friends of mine. I know people that have had cancer and had their cancer reduced by taking cannabis oil and I know people whose parents had it and got their.

Speaker 4:          01:39:23       Their tumors reduced because of it and autistic kids like the caesars and stuff like that. our friend and his kid was going from like. I mean he was having seizures all day. takes this stuff. He hasn't had a seizure in six months. You look at jaden and and charlotte and ali's, these kids. How caN you. How can you tell the parents? No, exactly. no matter what state you're in, how can you tell a parent know? And that's. I think that's when your politics changed and when it affects you personally. It definitely happens. It definitely happens and I've seen quite a few stories of that, of people that have children that have, you know, serious seizure issues and as soon as they got them on the medical marijuana and just stopped and we have a lot of really bad prejudices about marijuana and we need to expose them like as a society because they're holding a lot of people back.

Speaker 4:          01:40:05       I know they held me back. They made me until I was 30 years old. I thought that was for idiots. So it really did. a lot of people do and it's, it's important to let them know. Not only is it not for idiots, it's, it's, it's a tool that you can use it, you can, it can benefit you. Like this is not a benign substance. It's slippery, you know, like all other psychoactive substances, if you are on the wrong path mentally, like you could go off the deep end with it, like everything else, like alcohol or anything else. But

Speaker 2:          01:40:36       someone who I respect a lot like graham hancock, who have you had on the show a lot. He was a high heavy user and he got to a point, um, where he said, you know what, my relationship is not good with marijuana anymore. And he took a long break, I think two to three years. He took a long break and then said, you know what, things have changed in my life now. I think I could go back and have that relationShip start again. And from what I, what I understand mostly from the podcast, uh, from, from him being on the podcast last time, um, he is now in a better relationship with marijuana

Speaker 4:          01:41:16       that he was in an abusive relationship with himself. And marijuana was just playing a factor in that. Sure. I'm the one who got them high. Yeah. I got, I'm behind on the show when he was a. Who was it took two or three years sober. I'm like, too, you're fine. Just come on. You're the smartest dude ever. He loved it. And he and he opened up when I, when I gave it to him, oh my god. They opened up like a flower who took one hit and then he relaxed and he was smiling and laughing. We're having a good time and he went on this rant. Oh my god. It was epic rant, epic rant, and I remember thinking like, wow, that had to be cannabis inspired because it was so like emotionally connected to him. There was essentially like sort of validating his life work because he was really heavily criticized many, many times where people just completely ignored any of the potentially positive aspects of what he was saying and just was trying to shit on all they're trying to shit on all of these theories, but as time has gone on, it's been more and more apparent that he was right the whole time.

Speaker 4:          01:42:19       That's all different thingS that just studies. Yeah. Well the big one being that civilizations have experienced many diFferent areas and that will. We're looking at when we looked back, thousands and thousands of years is the most latest of arrows, but there was potentially very advanced civilizations that had a different kind of advancement. Ten thousand, 15,000 years, maybe as many as 30,000 years ago, and that there's evidence of this stuff. There's evidence in the construction of the old kingdom in Egypt. There's evidence when they start looking at certain erosion patterns on the sphinx and the sphinx compound like you're talking about, like something that was built 14,000 years ago plus. So all these different new discoveries that they're having when they're having these new there find these new things that are like four. They found evidence of north americans in a native americans in north America at 14,000 years ago, which pushes it way back before they thought it was.

Speaker 4:          01:43:13       They found like woolly mammoth bones with cuts on them and shit super recently. So this stuff keeps happening over and over again and they keep discovering these structures and you know, they find things underwater. They find sunken cities and shit go back later and yeah, exactly. Can carbon date stone. So that's why I go back to the so unique because they know that it was covered up somewhere around 12,000 years ago. Purposely. Someone constructed this thing sometime before that they, you know, they get a vague idea within a thousand years of when this thing was built and it was built when they thought people were hunter gatherers, so this is all stuff that hancock had already been saying, so to see him get high and just expand upon that and see like this is a guy that like he's been ridiculed, he's been dragged through the mud people have taken what you've said out of context and tried to use it against him.

Speaker 4:          01:44:02       They've had these really biased opinions about his Work and they've made little specials about it to shitting on him and it turns out he was right about a lot of things and it's just gathering evidence and then making, making his his thoughts and processes on, on evidence and he's a really good guy. Like he doesn't deserve any of that. He's not a, he's not a bad guy. Like he's a really good guy that's taken a chance that's exploring this really important subject. This idea that we've been here many times. I can remember reading magicians, magicians of the gods or fingerprints that his first, first one thinking things, footprints of the gods, right? Wasn't fingerprints, no fingerprints or your parents. I'm thinking, thank god there's a dude out there. I didn't know who he was at the time. Thank god there's someone doing this work because I had never heard of any of this before.

Speaker 4:          01:44:49       I read that book. Well, there's been a bunch of similar like theorists in the past, but they always connected it to like aliens, like specifically like zachariah hitchins such and such and stuff. Yeah. Well he. He was gonna bring up that guy from the chariots of the gods. What the fuck Is that guy's name? There was a dude, von danIken von daniken who wrote chariots of the gods and a chair to the gods was like a movie. They made a documentary movie about it that played in the movie theaters. I remember when I was a kid, it was playing in the movie theaters and I was freaking out and people would leave there though to go, oh my god, there's aliens. They visited us like that movie. If you watch that movie and you smoke pot and you're young, it will have a fucking convinced you will be fucking convinced.

Speaker 4:          01:45:33       One hundred percent. I feel like I was convinced and it's a lot of graham hancock who unconvinced me by, um, because a lot of people think he's part of the ancient alien theorists, but he's not really. He just feels that, that we have lost technology. Well, he leaves the door open. We've had conversations about it. He leaves the door open for visitation. He leaves the door open for that being a possibility as do why I think everybody should have a unique moment where an alien spacecraft came down and ran into 14th century europeans and fucked with them and you know, and kidnapped a few and did some science certificate experiments on some and erase their memories. you see that of course that could happen. I mean, if we can go tomorrow so we could send a robot to zoom around on mars and we watch it on her iphone, we can do that right now.

Speaker 4:          01:46:22       We're idiots. We're idiots. We can't even make pot legal. You've got a robot moving around on mars. The idea that there's something out there that's there's no way. No one is smarter than us. Dude can't happen. Like of course there's could be. If we stay alive for a thousand years, our technology is going to be unrecognizable. It's going to be so beyond anything we could possibly imagine today. Just looking how far it's come since we were kids growing up an eighties. These things that we see these, these things that everybody sees iconic gray creatures with the big black eyes. Those could be drones percent. I mean those could be artificially intelligent creatures that some super advanced civilization has created to gather up information on people that's totally possible and that would, that would make it so much easier for them to defy the laws of physics to five.

Speaker 4:          01:47:10       The laws, the laws of physics, the laws of, of space travel, like with human beings being unable to withstand the kind of pressure that it would require to go light speed and shit like that. These things are some fucking weird robot creation that doesn't even exist. You know, lives off of a lithium ion battery. It's gotten it's dick, you know that, that, that thing might be able to go forever, like it might. Radiation might not bother it. You might be able to shoot it into a fucking black hole and it comes out the other side. I mean, who knows what the fuck they can do a million years from now.

Speaker 2:          01:47:43       Right. Because in the avatar is just a robot. When you all know robots at this point can be controlled from a remote control. Yeah. We, it just depends how far away is that remote control, you know, where is that written in your control?

Speaker 4:          01:47:55       So the chariots of the gods guy and even the people that the ancient aliens guys that who the fuck knows there might have been a bunch of visitors. It's very possible. It's super possible if we can do it, of course something out there that's smarter than us can do it better than we could for sure of course. But with graham hancock is proposing is much more likely because it's backed by actual science and now that he's, he's joined efforts with that randall carlson guy and randall carson, who's an expert on asteroidal impacts and it's, it's the, the history of them in north America in the world. I mean he's a wizard when it comes to that stuff and he can just quoted off the top of his head all these different impact sites that they found and you realize like, oh geez, we can hit all the time and not only do we get hit all the time, there's evidence of a massive meteor shower impacting asia and europe somewhere around 10,000 plus years ago, which coincides with the civilization that they.

Speaker 4:          01:48:50       Exactly they're talking about. So somewhere around that era, the human race got fucking basically half wiped out. Yeah. We had a rebuild and we don't remember. We didn't have, there's no electronics back then. So there's no like computers that we could look at. There's no photos. They didn't have photographs, they were just basing on people's memories and things that they could draw. I mean, as far as we know, they didn't have any cameras. I mean, who knows. I mean all that stuff. If you, if you had a camera and you left it on the ground for a thousand years, there'd be nothing left and 100 they would all go away. It had batteries back then. They had something like a bat. They did. Yeah. Yeah. And they found that in one of the egyptian tombs, and they found it in Iraq to yet the little copper and the clay, they had some kind of computer or electronics that just doesn't exist anymore.

Speaker 4:          01:49:35       Not only that, the people who made that battery, they're pretty sure that was 2,500 bc. So that was way later than this impact. They're talking about this 11,000, whatever it was, year impact. They think that there's been a series of these all throughout history and this is something that's supported by even mainstream science when they're talking about super volcanoes. There's this one super volcano. We've looked this up three fucking times. I can ever remember this goddamned gino la speed. We'd bullshit. Um, but there's a super volcano that erupted 70,000 years ago and killed almost everyone on the planet except for a couple thousand people and we all descend from those few thousand people that survived some massive, super volcano impact. This is a really openly accepted theory and mainstream archeology and anthropology. They really believed that this is one of the possibly one of the big disaster extinction events that happened to human beings.

Speaker 4:          01:50:34       There's been several of them, right? I know what you're talking about. That's something that caused like three or four years of an equivalent of a nuclear winter. Well, here, look at it this way. You remember mount st helen's when we were kids. Remember that? Nobody talks about that. Nobody even thinks about that anymore. When we were kids, a fucking volcano in Washington state erupted and people died. They got lava. They got smoked by a volcano, ash for a month in mash for months, and it just conveniently goes away. That was a little baby volcano. I mean, obviously no disrespect to anybody who died, right? In comparison to what yellowstone has. Yellowstone as a super volcano that's 600 miles wide, something fucking crazy like that. I mean that's still, you know, they don't Call it acted that volcano, but it's still bubbling. Well, they have thousands of earthquakes every year.

Speaker 4:          01:51:27       Thousands. Like so you know, shit's going on down there. The guys yours are shooting up boiling water and the sulfur content in the water. It's crazy. Maybe it's 600 kilometers, 600 kilometers, 300 miles, whatever it is. It's so big that it's, it's a continent killer right there. Like when that thing blows everything near it is dead as fuck it. What it is is what they call a caldera, which means that it's a volcano that was so big. The top blew off of it and then you're left with this big crater and they didn't realize that until they started using sas satellite images. Once they started using [inaudible], we've known about old faithful, you know, that's it's a cool place to visit and go check out the geysers and stuff that sets the ground is boiling like 100 feet below you is hot lava and every six, 800,000 years that shit blow sky high and when it blow sky high, everyone's dead.

Speaker 4:          01:52:19       We're all dead. We're all dead and California is dead. Montana's dead as fuck. Everything around. It's just dead. It's depressing because it really is just a matter of time before there's some, some impact or earthquake or a volcano. It's just a matter of time and which ones, what's it going to be? Well, what graham hancock, because exposing is that when you're talking about enormous periods of time, like 10,000 years, 12,000 years, 30,000 years, people cannot recall those natural disasters. They lose the ability to communicate. Sometimes they're not even using the same languages anymore. You're dealing with thousands and thousands and thousands of years. I mean, just think about just a few thousand years ago, latin was like a real language, you know, joe, go try finding someone that going to talk latin for, you know, that shit doesn't it? It's a dead language. It's, you know, that's only a couple thousand years when you're talking about 30,000 years and the possibility of all these different impacts and different things happening within those 30,000 years. Like who knows. So what he's showing is where would he was showing back then was that this alternative theory is not preposterous at all. Like there's, there's real good evidence that this is not gonna stay like this, right?

Speaker 2:          01:53:29       Like it's just not preposterous. It's probable and likely that it's just what's next. Will old faithful was called old faithful because it used to be faithful and blow at the exact time. It doesn't do that anymore. It's no longer on the old faithful type of a schedule that it, that it used to be changing. I don't like that on that air. I don't like. It makes me nervous. I don't like that, you kNow? And that's just in our life. When did that stop? I only recently heard it heard that, uh, you know, that that's new story. That old faithful is not as faithful as a, as a pinch. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:54:05       Yeah. It's weird. The geysers are hot water water's boiling. It shoots up into the sky and we're like, ooh, ah, well let's get outta here before giant furry monster eats us. Yellowstone's crAzy. That's a crazy goddamn place. Those people have grizzly bears, grizzly bears are there all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:54:24       There's a police in, I believe it's Ohio, California, where they have these big mud pits that people go in that are real hot and, you know, but what, what do you think is heating those on, under there? I mean, that could also just quickly explode. I,

Speaker 4:          01:54:40       I don't know. I mean, those, those hot pits are totally natural and Ohio. Is that what it is?

Speaker 2:          01:54:44       They, as far as I know they are. I haven't been in my, I have a healthy fear of them. I guess for a, of just, just, you know, think things like that. And um, you know, in nature that could. Mother nature just wants to kill us

Speaker 4:          01:55:02       so many ways. Just sorta right now we're fine. I mean no, no need to totally freak out about it, but just the awareness that this whole thing is probably pretty fucking temporary and we're in the worst state to live in. That's so crazy to say. I don't know why you say that. Earthquake volcano were definitely better off where we were in toronto or something. Probably you freeze to death in the winter. Hits black eyes. I think this is a really good state, but a lot of nice people.

Speaker 2:          01:55:31       More people die in a weather and natural things in every other state besides

Speaker 4:          01:55:36       California. Yeah, I mean if there's an earthquake, there's going to be a few issues for sure. Yeah. Earthquakes, fuck a lot of things up. But overall man, like you deal with an earthquake once every couple of decades. You deal with winter every fucking year. If you go back to Ohio, trying to keep him here isn't the biggest fault line like Missouri or that shit doesn't work though. That's broken. So like an old train station that be broken. I don't know man. I mean, look, we're worried about stuff that we know about these, these spots where the earth could explode, but when I fucking rocks in the sky, that could kill everybody. They, they, they hit all the time. They hit every few thousand years. So these spaces of civilization like 10,000, 12,000 years, these where they find these structures like go beckley, tappi, and they like, who the fuck? Where did this, where's this kind of. It's so likely that that's just a series of events. it's like people build up. They figured out society to get things going really well. They stArted improving upon things and boom, everybody's dead rotting bodies in the street. Diseases, wolves, flee to the mountains, rebuild civilization first. Fucking tribes don't make it down to a few people. They slowly bond together. They rebuild. I bet that shit happens every 20,000 years or so.

Speaker 2:          01:57:00       One of the theories I heard on gold beckley tapi is that since that's what happened, that there was some devastation at that point that the theory is that they blamed it on whatever gods and that's why I go back to tempe was just covered at that point. We just hired this high debt

Speaker 4:          01:57:17       right away. Yeah. Well that makes sense. If you were like a politician you're trying to take over after the disaster. People like these motherfuckers in their statues ruined everything and we're going to fill it in with dirt. No, it'd be like symbolic because you can't like run a dope ass city with some statues that the dude before you made. Nope. Nope. You got to knock those bitches over. we still do the same thing today. Well, isis is doing it right now. All throughout asia. They keep blowing shit up. You know we yanked down. Saddam didn't win. Yeah. boy, that shit right there. Head fell off. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That statue. I forgot about that. But we all do it. We all want to like hide what was before us because what? What we are as good. What we do is right, especially when it comes to someone like saddam hussein.

Speaker 4:          01:58:03       Yeah, like we, we like celebrated it. When that statue went down. Yes, she was dutch folk. We dId them all that statues kind of history, like we really shouldn't have been fucking with it because like if you could see what julius caesar did, like if you could go back and see what nero did, like all the atrocities that he did, he wouldn't want to see a statue of him. But imagine if someone came along and smashed a statue of him, you wouldn't be able to look at it today. Like there's something about when you go to a museum and you look at something from ancient rome and they go, wow, that crazy fucker. What was life like? What was this guy's life like? You know, these people were nuts. They were out of their fucking

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       minds. They were living at a crazy, crazy time of taking over the world with swords and bows and arrows and shit. But is saddam hussein worse than them? No, no, no. Not really. No. They takIng that shit and put it in a museum somewhere. My college had christopher columbus pointing at the cafeteria. Right. Kids. He was a cool guy. He just became something over the last decade or so. Right. The christopher columbus was a piece of shit. Yeah, right.

Speaker 2:          01:59:11       You know, another thing, I believe it's from graham hancock, but um, the iraqi museum had a lot of material that just got wiped out during these wars that will never be able to get back, that had to do with ancient art, ancient societies and Egypt and things like that. So, so during these wars, you know, the whole place will just lose it. You know, the museum was alluded so they lost all of those, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:59:39       that. And that's a tragedy. That's like the birth of modern civilization is like the tigris and euphrates, that little valley there. You got to keep that, you know, I understand the politics, but you got to keep the history. Leave it alone, that there's rules of war that says you can bomb anything you want, but the colosseum in rome, that's not cool. You do that. You will going to talk to you in the hey glenn, a few years, you know, the great wall of China, you guys leave that alone, bomb each other, but there were protected sites in the world that needs to stay protected. Isn't that weird? Like we, we decide like, okay, look, we don't like you. This building's pretty dope. Yeah. We're not going to fuck up that building. And then I got you got it. Like all right. No, no punching in the face.

Speaker 5:          02:00:19       Okay, cool. Because I ever bombed paris. Like the eiffel tower get bombed or anything. Anywhere around paris get bombed. Yeah. they just kind of stormed through there because they did. There was like, there's still like a lot of ammunition. There's like this area outside of paris and France. It's like the size of paris that you can't even go into today because there's still like ordinances buried under the ground. We keep finding stuff there. They stack it up and these warehouses and shit. It's just like a depository for bombs and bomb chemicals. They all fucking either launched amount of. There are. They landed there and it didn't go off or they left behind mines and bombs was just huge area that you. You can't even go In. It's all toxic and it's the size of parents apparently. Wow. Yeah. So it was wondering like wonder, was there a conscious decision to not bomb, like maybe, maybe they did and I don't. I don't know. I don't think they did. I think they just kind of rolled through there because I mean london got the shit kicked out of it. See if you cAn find that picture. Ges, there's photos of the munitions where they stack them up. It's crazy. Picture of paris getting bombed from the familiar. Oh, well there you go. Did they lead the. I look at that. Holy shit. Wow. There goes our, like the library of alexandria got destroyed. That was in Egypt though.

Speaker 3:          02:01:39       I know, but I'm just saying that was during the muslim. Yeah. Yeah. I know it's a different time period, but I was just, I was going to ask like that. Is there something today that contains a bunch of history that could be destroyed and ruined and setting? Yeah, like

Speaker 1:          02:01:51       computers. The problem would be if the power went out for more than a couple of years, it's never coming back. Right. If the grid got destroyed, if something happened that was so big that it destroyed the power grid and we needed to reestablish a grid, good luck, and then we lose. We lose 50 percent of the population in the impact. And then you know what, we were left with chaos and lawlessness and fucking people starving to death and no one knows what to do. Yeah, good luck in the power back on that. All would take is one of those things. It might take 100 years for the power to come back on

Speaker 3:          02:02:21       and that might not even be negative intent of humans. That can happen just from the sun in emp. We don't know. We haven't had electric long enough. We might have had an emp, you know, what's an emp explaining a electrode, a magnetic pulse, which would take out all of the electronic. You just say emp or emp. We sit around and talk about this all the time was, was dog. But they, they, you know, there's um, they've tried to make an amp weapons that that'll take you, take out a full grid. But if, but the son could produce that. So if the son did that and it could have been done in history where we just didn't have electric, there's evidence of an, of an emp or a solar flare that hit some time in the, in the 19th century, we only know about it because a telegraph like went down all the telegraphs in America went down for like two days and everyone was like, what happened? And then a couple of days later everything worked again. And, and scientists think that it was a solar flare or their ejection that caused an enp and just shut down all the power for a few days here it would be a, it'd be walking dead if it happened. Now is so crazy that we rely on that thing to stay stable.

Speaker 1:          02:03:32       This giant ball of nuclear power that's floating in the sky. It's a million times bigger than the earth. And we, we count on it to stay stable.

Speaker 3:          02:03:41       We do what the solar flare is still happening a lot though. Recently there was something that knock something out from a solar flare, but the sun has been weird lately. It's been really, really dark and strange. There's not a lot of activities. One smokes too much pot. The sun's been dark and strange. Not a lot of activity. Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm really talking about being serious. Oh, what's going on with the son? The son normally has a lot of solar activity, storms, ejections, all that kind of stuff. The last 12, 15 years, it's been really qUiet and it's dying. It's a cycle, but you know, everybody freaks out. It's global warming. It's a little cooling. It's climate. This, it's, it's just a solar cycle and it's just. The sun is just chilled right now, taking a breather in 10 years and they say

Speaker 1:          02:04:28       our cycle, they're measuring what they've been measuring over the period of whatever amount of decades they've been able to measure solar cycles, but this thing has been around measurement. Yeah. The sun's like, oh, you expect me to behave like I've been behaving for the last 50 years? Yeah, good luck with that dude, because I got a fucking temper sometimes. I like to blow up a whole solar system turning into a crisp. I watched this crazy documentary on hyper nobles and that they initially thought that they were. They were witnessing when they saw these gamma burst in the sky, they thought they were witnessing war between alien races. Like that was the initial reaction to measuring these gamma burst in the sky and then they realized somewhere along the line that you looking at like a hyper nova, like an enormous burst, an explosion. That's so great that if it was in a nearby cluster it would kIll us. Yeah. Yeah. That gamma radiation. I think just the whole lowe's that we can. That we can even measure. Yeah, and the. The thing was that it was happening all day, all throughout the sky. Like they would be like measuring this for the first time and they've seen

Speaker 9:          02:05:44       cool,

Speaker 1:          02:05:47       like all these different spots in the universe. we're experiencing these gamma burst. How would you not think it's star wars? Yeah, I totally think that's exactly what they thought. Like, oh my god, what If they come? What if they come and they have this kind of power? They have gamma power, right? So we have to band, we'd, we have to, you know, get society on the right track. It seems like at least we could like give them are gold are women and they might leave us be, it might be possible to negotiate, but you can't go. I'm just kidding about that obviously, but you can't negotiate with a supernova. You know, when a sun explodes and takes out the entire surrounding area for billions and billions of miles, that's it. It's like, it's less, it's less feared, but way scarier. Right? You can't build an ark to escape a nova, you know, like it's just not.

Speaker 1:          02:06:36       That's just a little water. It apparently it happens all the time. you know, and you probably won't happening right now somewhere and you can never convince society of it that, hey, we've got bigger problems to worry about. Then between me and you hear the pot delivery services you fuck at [inaudible] dot com. [inaudible] dot com delivers a, you'll get a little package like this, just like amazon prime, although it'll be in a box that you don't look lIke just a regular delivery. This is your cue, etc. You're getting them, you're sending them through the mail. It's not through the mail. A of people during the medical courier? Yeah. Oh, career medical courier. How high is your medical courier? Well, the middle of driving, going, what am I doing with my feet? They actually don't know what medicine they have because they do all sorts of medication. They don't just, they don't just do pot, don't meanwhile, but they're still high as fuck. So I'm uh,

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       you know, uh, there are regulations that are coming down for, for transported as well. Uh, the teamsters want to get their, their hands and transport, which they are one of the people who are rallying against legalization of marijuana. I'm there with the, the, um, the unions for prisons. So they're kind of fighting on both sides. They want to be involved in transportation of marijuana, however they're lobbying for to keep it illegal.

Speaker 5:          02:08:06       Did the teamsters, they're going to be on whatever side winds are over here now. Okay. You're over here now.

Speaker 2:          02:08:12       Yeah. Yeah. Um, so, so again, uh, you know, uh, what we were considered was similar to the dominoes of marijuana here in la. We, we, uh, are evolving. That's what we were doing before this lawsuit happened. We really want to be considered more like amazon prime. So, uh, where you're making a lot of money. And we were dumb now that I be like circuit city, well, governor brown's new laws have changed so that marijuana companies can be for profit now. They don't have to be not for profit, which is how it's been for the last 20 years here. So, um, and so that has to go into effect by 2018. So that's something to consider also, once that happens, that changes things for a lot of cannabis businesses, but that all said, every cannabis business that's in, in la, that's not a dispensary in, in that whether they're making edibles or they making vaporizers or, or anything.

Speaker 2:          02:09:16       And it's a thriving industry. They're all illegal. Every bit of it. So regulation does need that, that, that happened, uh, you know, uh, here in la and what we're asking for isn't he just overturned this. We're not saying that we're saying we know the city attorney does believe that safe access is important, but he feels he has to uphold this law that was put into effect before he was the city attorney. So since he knows this is a bad law that he has to enforce, he could also affect change by helping go down the path of legalization for good businesses. He'S, he's not an idiot. he realizes what a bad law is. He just knows his job is to enforce it. Got it. So hopefully, hopefully he'll join the fight to find a path towards legal. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:10:03       Okay. What can people do with the people that are listening the to wrap this all up? What, uh, the people that are listening, what's a good way to follow this or a good way to help? Good way to help. If you're in California, good way to help us to join our collective energy. You buy anything and we'll keep you in touch with the politicians and will put pressure on them. If you're outside of California, what dOes that mean? You politicians, you put pressure on them joining. What would that entail? A joining our collective like if you're a medical marijuana patient, join [inaudible] dot com and we are working actively with the city. Try to solve this. It's not. So we're fighting in court? Yes, on one hand, but on the other hand we are conversing with the city, like the city knows this is broken. Okay, well what do you mean by joining your collective?

Speaker 5:          02:10:43       LIke what? What does that entail? Go to go to [inaudible] dot com. Click join and you put your name, email address. That's all they have to do. That's pretty much it. Do they have to show you proof of medical marijuana license? They do if they want to order prescription, but if they could join your collective without doing that, they need to show proof that there are patient to join a collective. Oh, okay. All right. That's what I was asking. Yeah, but we also have are so lackadaisical with us. So normal. it's like, yeah, just join a collective. Like it's, it's hard to, you know, it's hard to be wedding people don't know what we're even talking about. What it is trouble you can, if you don't have your card, your, your doctor recommendation, you could get it right on our website by doing a skype session with your doctor and you know, we told the story about about how, how we got our cards in.

Speaker 5:          02:11:32       It's changed so much. Wait a minute, a doctor or I have to get my doctor to do a skype session. Your own doctor, right? yeah. so now you're a doctor, you're saying not your doctor, your doctor. We have a group of doctors. RIght. That's what I'm saying, that our professional doctors that you will do a real skype session and they'll. And they'll talk to you about what your ailment is and, and you could get your card instead of going somewhere. You could just do it right in your living room. That's an important point. See, when you were making it seem like the guy had to get like, oh man, I've got to get my doctorate. No, no, no, no. Ten minutes. I've been at 1:00, jesus christ. How many tokens a it takes 10 minutes to do. Right? On our website we hAve this amazing interactive people waiting that will be selling point will take you right through the whole process where we need to do we need to buy a warehouse in California and a bunch of people use it as their mailing address and get people from other states to become a part of your collective and they have like a fake mailing address.

Speaker 5:          02:12:26       Then we hook them up, but we are we going to talk more about that idea? He goes, dark city attorneys watching. I didn't know. Yes, it's going to do it that way, but I think it's just funny that you know, you have to be in this patch of dirt in order to follow those rules. Like you can't. You couldn't join the collective. You couldn't be like from most constant and decided, oh, I want to join one of those California poc collectives. I'll skype in with the doctor and no, you have to actually like have like your mail delivered here. It's so stupid. It's weird. Like an arbitrary line in the sand politically across this line. go to jail, come back here and get baked and have a good time. Well that's what happens with people that go into Texas. You fuck up and you're in a tour bus. You know, we're this way is the bass and here. Oh no, that's a song. You get pulled over and you're like, oh no. We got pulled over for weed in Texas. This is not like getting pulled over for weeding California and next thing you know willie nelson's in jail. Yeah, that's a Willie Nelson got arrested, right? It's hilarious. Someone such a piece of shit. They arrested Willie Nelson. I'd quit my job so my kids are going hungry. Fucked us. It's actually great. It's actually pretty scary getting pulled over with weed in California

Speaker 8:          02:13:32       nowadays because of dui rate has gone crazy. My friend's a lawyer, dui lawyer and half of his cases now are just from marijuana and they have a new test where they do the same kind of thing with your eye, but it, it like goes left and right real fast if you're high or something like that. And if they feel like they, they can smell weed and if, if you fail this test, you're getting a dui just like an alcoholic left to right. We'll quit. So you know when, when, when you get pulled over, they do the test with your. I like fall, my aunt. I think with alcohol, I think it shoots over like your eyes shoots over to the left or the right really fast or it's jerky, uh, when you're, when you're high, your eye reacts different every day. It's kind of like a jiggly left and right effect when it, there can't be any science. So that's, that's it right now. And right now in court they are fighting just that. If it's, if it's a legit test and they don't have a like a point, oh, eight for weed yet. So they didn't really have any laws.

Speaker 5:          02:14:30       There's the main problem, and I think you'll agree with me, there's never been a study that shows that any loss of motor skills. No, none. Right? There wAs one study about driving a while smoking weed and that they found that people actually performed better route. Well, that's the problem. It's not a motor skill thing. It's not like alcohol. Everybody knows that if you drink too much, you don't drIve good. Everybody knows that it's bad for your motor skills. Pot's not. It's simple. So what are they pulling you over for exactly? state of mind. So because if it doesn't affect your motor skills, like is it affecting your judgment? Can you prove that people were intoxicated on marijuana perform less intelligently than people that are intoxicated on caffeine or cigarettes because you know they're doing that. A cop could pull a guy over, he could have a cigarette in the corner of his mouth drinking a cup of coffee and no one says a word.

Speaker 5:          02:15:16       Those are two drugs interact with each other. No one has a pro. So it's a state of mind issue. So. And he could have those drugs and still have a couple of pops at the bar to really amp up all that aggression and still legally drive behind what is, um, what his intoxication. I mean, isn't intoxication is supposed to be a loss of motor skills? Well, right. But it's sort of arbitrary because wHat, what is intoxicated? the swab test just did not pass in California where they were trying to, to swab for thc molecules and it's like, no, that's totally, you can't do that because. Because I'm going to just walk through a party and then they get swapped and they're in trouble. They don't have any of it in their system. You can't, you can't. Like gino would, what? He smokes. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          02:15:58       I don't even know when he's high. I don't know when he's done. Trust me is high right now. Trust me. You wouldn't know. So mAny people are high right now and you wouldn't know. Right? Of course. So how can you test for it? Well, they're. The real problem is what can you show is bad about being high? I need to see something on your tests where you show me why you should be able to pull people over with why you're wearing a gun and shine a light in their face and get them out of their vehicle and make them do things like what is the worst case you're looking for? Okay. What's

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       the worst case scenario that's going on with this person that's on the marijuana? Are they performing in any way, shape or form? Whether they're a danger the people around them. So if that's. If that is true, I think you have to prove that before you put people in a fucking cage.

Speaker 8:          02:16:45       It also varies from person to person. I believe. I know a girl that smokes a joint, she can't drive. She can barely function as a human, but jay, you know, could do a whole ounce and you'll be fine to drive as exact same driver as before, if not better. But this girl, no way. I wouldn't even let her in the car. She smoked her that she probably shouldn't be able to drive anyway. How about that shit? Right? There should be like a test, we've talked about this before, like a marijuana test, like you are a 10, meaning you could do with marijuana and anything and you're fine, but this person's like rated a six.

Speaker 4:          02:17:15       It's just. But it's a mind issue. It's not. It's not a motor skill issue. This is where the problem lies. It's like, yeah, I guess some people would freak out when they're on pot and they will do lose their mind and maybe they shouldn't be intoxicated, but those people probably lose their mind if someone yelled at them right now. Some people would just weak. They just, whatever the, the glue that keeps their reality together. It's just really fragile and then throw some pot in there or a drink. I mean, how many people do we know that have one drink and they get fucking crazy. That's a person who's reality's really shaky. Right? But that doesn't have anything to do with me. You know, and the idea that cops look towards that as being the standard is ridiculous. Right? So if you like, if it wasn't going to say, if you have like a festival, like a, a cop's test, potheads festival, we would do it.

Speaker 4:          02:18:05       We would fucking do it. Look for sure you have go-karts. Set it up. What do you want to do? You want to have a fucking one of those mud bogger races. We'll do this. Let us smoke pot. We'll do all that. We'll have jujitsu tournaments where people smoke pot before they do jujitsu. It orange cones and clipboards and some wheat and people will join. Fuck you. And we'll learn. We'll know. Yeah. What you need to show some sort of significant issue because there's a significant issue with some people, but you're not even stopping those people from taking. Who knows what the fuck they're taking as far as antidepressants are psychoactive substances prescribed by their doctors. And how many people are on fucking adderall? Man, that's meth. They're taking meth. They're driving around. You know, I know a bunch of adults that take that shit on a daily basis yet. So w, what you're dealing with is a lot of different chemicals that could potentially fuck with a mind. Like why are you concentrated on pot given shown any reason to concentrate on pot.

Speaker 8:          02:19:02       You know, the chIef of police in New York city recently said that every crime could be tied back to marijuana that's holding him, uh, you know, which is a criminal outrageous because it's just trying to give more reach for police officers to pull you over. Irresponsible thing to say. That's like saying every crime can be tied back to water. Parents, we all have 96 of water. All.

Speaker 4:          02:19:29       Yeah. It's all stupid man. It really is. It's just something that should be a joke that We look back on from the 19 thirties. We look back and like, oh wow, look at the craziness that these people that are dealing with baCk then. But instead we have to deal with it today and the age of google and information, scientific studies ad nauseum that all show the same thing. And none of Them show any negative effects. None of them. There's like some questions about memory. That's it. But it seems to only affect you while you're on it. When you get off of it. It doesn't seem to have any effect on your memory at all.

Speaker 2:          02:20:00       I mean, the head of the dea currently said medical marijuana. That's just a joke. Let let's, let's get past that. And I'm the head of the dea before that, when asked by congress it, is marijuana a more detrimental than meth? She said she can't. And we played that many times

Speaker 4:          02:20:20       was on the show because it's so ridiculous. That was laying heart, right? Yeah. She was in. This was a senator or something. kept grilling her. If you haven't seen it, it's fucking infuriating.

Speaker 2:          02:20:30       It is. So what's so infuriating also is that we all know so well. How come these people who are in power aren't, aren't in the know why

Speaker 4:          02:20:41       not a no, it's that they are the official response. Right? So they looked at ladies just doing her job. She couldn't just speak out of turn. She couldn't. She would get fired. She couldn't just say whatever she wants. Even if she doesn't. Even if she doesn't believe that it should be illegal, she's not going to say that because that's not her job. Her job is to do whatever the fuck her superiors tell her to do and to stay employed and make sure her budget doesn't get exactly. That's her job. So it's not even her fault. It's the fault of the system that they accept that the whole thing is preposterous. IT doesn't, doesn't hold up anymore.

Speaker 2:          02:21:13       Well, this is why we have to play this game of politics. You know, we, we just want to want to run a business and a good business, but we have to play this game of politics because if we don't, from the bottom effect change through those people who are at the top, then we didn't and let them continue to create these laws. We could just go another 20 years with these bad laws when there's no reason for it, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:21:37       I think you're right. I'm just hoping that what's gonna go on is that, as you know from the time that I first got my license up today, how much more open? It's been much more relaxed, people are much more accepting, people are of it and much more accepting amongst grown adults. You just see the attitudes of people. They're changing and people understanding how beneficial or how beneficial it is, especially for people who need it. Medically. Cancer patients, things, things along those lines. Kids with epilepsy add things along those lines. There's just so many people that benefit from it. It's, it's hopefully it's on its way out. All the laws are on their way out. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:22:13       And, and you can't just disregard the experience of, of the masses. Yeah, exactly. It's not fair and it's because we're, we're lucky to be in sort of the media age,

Speaker 5:          02:22:25       which can be annoying at times, but it also allows information at move very quickly. Yeah. So it's. So if your kid is helped by having fewer seizures, everybody's gonna know about that in 24 hours, so. So you can't really suppress the truth any longer. And even Texas is polling positively. Yeah. Florida is going to pass it, you knoW, Pennsylvania just passed it. It's the dominoes are falling, the dominoes are falling. And people at chris christie or going to be as amber lyon likes to say on the wrong side of history and that's just, there's no other way around it. It's just this guy's a fool. He's a fool and he needs to get off the sugar contact mark sisson bitch. He'll straighten you out. Primal blueprint.com. All right. That's it. Goodnight everybody. Thank you, gino. Thank you. Ha.
