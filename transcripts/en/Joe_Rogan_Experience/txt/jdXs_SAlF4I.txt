Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Not only as a mortal technique here, but his broad a motherfucker so cool that he's wearing a fanny pack. Bobby Bang, Bang. Independent of my love for the fanny pack. This dude was, she's out there all completely on his own, on the Nache with true love for the fanny pack. Much respect. Not only am I bring it back to fanny pack, I just started selling them. So I sell a higher primate.com fanny pack. It's a quality roots fanny pack, just dice clay was in and he had the dopest fanny pack, this sweet leather fanny pack. And it was so nice. City bank was something wrong. It was me by roots. You know that company that makes bags, it's like a dope fanny pack. And I was like, what'd you get done? When I was jealous cause all my other ones were functional but discuss thing. But this was like, it was actually fashionable. I was like, I can bring it back with roots. So I contacted roots and had them print up the higher primate logo on a fanny pack. So boom. Not just t shirts, but now fanny packs a motherfucker's branching out. See, there it is. It's hard to see the logo, but then some monkey with like

Speaker 2:          00:01:07       go, whoever coined the term fanny packs are we fucking see. To me, if it had been like survival pack, every dude would have when like, oh dude, I got my new survival pack. My, it's not a man purse. It's a survival pack. No Dude, it's a fanny pack. I don't mind saying I'll put it on. Lie Down. It's true strength that you're not worried about the definitions of others. Really word. These guys who have given you a hard time during this rocket. Rocket strong. No, not me. It was my there. I would rock that one bucket. Bucket strong. I like that. Survive survival pat. It's all in the market though.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       Yeah, it's, it's a cock shield. Keeping myself in them. If an asteroid comes from the sky, it'll hit my fanny pack before it hits my deck.

Speaker 2:          00:01:50       Hopefully it'll deflect, deflect it. Listen if something's falling out of the fanny pack and save your pack and your leg and then two days today, cell phones are very durable, my friend. Correct. I think you're out of line.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       You've done those studies. Yeah. There's some fucking people that have survived actually rocks falling from the sky and hit it. I'm strange enough a lady got hit in the arm recently. It was like a, it went through her house and like hit her arm. All right, thank you. Can get great. Okay. Come on. I mean she didn't catch a dome shot, you know, that would have been some whole other shit, you know? Yeah. Well most likely you're going to die if you get hit by some folks with Scott, Donnie Darko, jet falling out of the sky. Yeah. Engine. Most likely. If something falls from the sky, you're fucked. But if it doesn't and it hits your higher primate fanny pack, you might survive, son. You might get to that shit alive. Better survival packs. Survival pack. Indeed. Indeed. So if I have a pack, just sounds too phony though. Nah, you got to

Speaker 2:          00:02:59       put the survival pack and then you got to put like the Joe Rogan Cock Shield edition with like just like the metal plate. I think it should just be implied.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       and n I t since Aubrey Marcus was on the podcast yesterday. We talked a lot about on it. I'll give you an abbreviated podcast sponsor. This is human optin. Is that when you'd say [inaudible] sometimes that you're supposed to say n a n and it seems like you'd say, ah, but really it's supposed to be an like I, I forget. There's a few examples of that where it's the correct grammar is actually Ann and I and I sometimes pretend them smart and try to use it the right way and I fuck it up. I'm on it.com o n n I t, a human optimization website. We sell all sorts of strength conditioning equipment, supplements, supplements, both for athletic activities and also for mood and cognition and even for your immune system on it.com o. N N. I t used the Codeword Rogan save 10% off any and all. All right. And mortal technique is here. It's get cracking

Speaker 2:          00:12:02       Joe Rogan podcast. He's back. Ladies and gentlemen with the new posse mortal technique. The only guy this is posted on the message board, uh, yesterday. This is the only guy that brought a posse to the podcast and they didn't suck. Oh thank you. Cause usually when you get posses you get like,

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       like you'll have like one cool dude and his friends who are annoying, you know that shit happens. We're also just him, me, all my peoples holding down. All right. This is my brother, Chino XL Chino, my man. And that is my, with Bobby Bowden. It was throbbing. It was just his birthday. So he's still recovering. Tom. It's hard being on the road with these two

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       I'm sure especially cause Bobby rocks a fanny pack soldier and Barbara, you'd be surprised what fanny, how many wonders the fanny pack does for me. Hey man, it's great at the airport clip. Drop it in that bag, pick it up at the other side. Boom. Done. Survival pack, survival. Surviving. What am I going to survive? What do you, what do you got another 50 years. Come on man, you ain't survive and shit. No one survived and shit. Maybe the getting bypass. Maybe the I exists now pat. It really should be called a groupie pack cause you could just flip it around and keep all your personal items and never leaves your, oh you're a criminal yourself relating me or anybody else. Just him. I don't know what you meant by that. That just slide all the men in the room.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       You said you confuse you the fuck out of here with that. You got a little cocky on there. That's what happened there son. You forgot where you were. It's a survival plan as part of the survival pack. The works survival. That's like a Douchey word though, right? Like survival. Like you know like survival survivor man is cool but like survival training, we're going through survival training. Like I'll come on man, what are you doing and you'll find the people are, is there are people who really do that type of like my friend told me,

Speaker 4:          00:13:58       uh, there was some ex military dude that he liked trains executives on like this survival like vacation weekend. And it's basically like for people that want to feel like they did something important. So He'd take them out to like this like area in the countryside and they run a bunch of obstacles and they get them in shape for like, you know, week or two and then bust their ass. And then they call it like survival training. But that's obviously not like real survival training. So by that I guess he had jumped out of like a parachute out of a fucking plane into like a wilderness area and then meet someone at a certain place like two weeks later. Like all right, go to like Lz one like you know, 15 miles away through like wolf dens and mountain ranges forest and who the fuck else knows? You know, you just can't take the four oh five there.

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       You got to walk on the fucker. That's the train. They can be a real show that where they took a guy and just dropped him off hunger games style in the middle of the woods. I'm, I'm Kinda surprised they haven't done that yet. That'd be kind of very interesting. They sorted, they like can survivor, they do go and they have to like get food and they, they do shit like that. But it's very different than like taking one person and like telling them that they have to make it across a forest and get to another side. You know, I'd never really watched that show too often are where their lives ever really endanger. That's the point. It's always an Dorrance really more than survival because you know that there's a way out. Let's take somebody who didn't even know this was going to happen at all and dropped them there.

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       Yeah. Well those people that are on that show, you know like when you like you see that everybody gets by okay and everybody's okay and the, you know, like they're not in danger because it's television. They're, they're in danger. If you're in Borneo or one of those places where they filmed survivor man, survivor rather, you're in danger, you're fucking for sure in danger. There's a lot of shit out there. Like just because he's a bunch of cameras out there, it doesn't mean they're going to keep you safe. Like when we did fear factor, there was a lot of times we just got lucky with like, nobody got hurt, but it's just because we got lucky like a rattlesnake, which, you know, like bowls. They made people ride bowls. All right. That's just ridiculous. Dude. They had a 90 pound girl. I say they, I'm distancing myself from the shot.

Speaker 1:          00:16:08       No, no. I said like, he wasn't in that, like I wasn't even the tone at the top of the book. If it was happening today, I swear to God, I would tell them not to do it. I would tell the girl not to do it 100%. Like there was a guy that was like a crazy daredevil dude. I would have said, you know, hey man, people have done it. I Know Donaldson, Ronny [inaudible], Ronny rides bulls, the crazy fuck. But for most people, it's a hair raising proposition for this little 98 pound girl. There's no way she's going to be able to hang on. And these guys who were the, the stunt guys were like, don't worry about it. These are stunt bowls. They're, uh, they're, they're less aggressive. There's stunt bolts. Yeah, but this, I'm like the bold isn't though. It's a fucking stud ball to the bull.

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       He's a bull. There's no stunt bowls in the bowl world. They don't have like a, well, you know, I'm just thought, you know what man, I'm not going to tell you as something, you know what I mean? That's my brother over there, away about the amount of dudes. You know what? I'm just gonna. I'm showing you his boss and then I'm going to stomp on your head. Now they'll stop on your fucking head. They'll kick you in the face. We just got lucky. So like survivor man, that guys, that's real shit. Like there's nothing fake about that show. But that's when that dude exists by himself and, and you know, he'll get to like a certain location and I'll pick them up like in five days. He even doesn't 10 days sometimes, but that's the guy that carries his own camera, right? Yes. That is 100% legit.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       He's in danger. He's in danger every show. I think I seen him super dehydrated at one time. It was really, really bad if that mother fucker was in Lyon territory, the survivor man, survivor man or the survivor, the show survivor on man. I was making the comparison between the two of them. Like that survivor show, there's still in danger. You're, you're still in danger. You're doing a bunch of dangerous shit. You're doing wild aggressive shit. But no, no, you know, no more danger than if anybody would be, if you were camping, you know, camping, you're doing dangerous shit different. If it was like survivor Basra, like survivor, Mogadishu matter. I mean survivor man, Shit. Like that dude went to Africa and he slept a night in Africa in this area where we're lions live with a hot air balloon. And he's, his idea was, the idea for the show was if you were in a hot air balloon and it ran out of gas and it fell somewhere like wa or the balloon got punctured or some shit and it fell somewhere and you were trapped, how would you get by?

Speaker 1:          00:18:21       How would you get out of it? So this guy went to fucking Africa and that was all he had for shelter was the basket that this fucking, this suppose that hot air balloon had and then the flame thrower to, to make the balloon inflate and go up. You know, they hit that the fire comes up and the heat is what makes the balloon rise and they drop it off when they want it to fall. Well he uh, had that as well and he was using that to keep the lions away low and fire at them because when he would set it up on the ground, it was like a flame thrower. Right. Cause it's when, when it's underneath the, the balloon, it's, you know, it's blowing this fire up into the inflated balloon. But when it's on the ground, he's just shooting it at the line.

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       It's just him and one can't it just him and a camera and a camera and some fucking lions. Did you hear in the background you hear like, yeah, that's good to know how that show's going to end. Right? It's just going to end with like a still shot of like it was fucking camera on the ground and people picking out his NDA man. Well yeah, I think what they do is they um, they know where he is by GPS location and I guess he probably has a satellite phone. Like if everything went terribly wrong and he had to call, like if he breaks his leg or something like that, he'll just die. I mean, he has to get medical help so they'll, they must have some sort of a plan, but he still, his life is in danger every step of the way. Oh, I mean when you see people that swim with sharks for example, that's the part that I, I say, okay, I did that with like baby sharks and we'd like sand sharks.

Speaker 1:          00:19:46       They have something at the mall of America. I went back then with like my ex girlfriend years and years and years ago. It was cool. But when I see people who swim with like 10 foot sharks, 12 foot in like the wild, you know, where the shark doesn't know that you're a filmmaker. It doesn't have any idea that this is for discovery or anything else. Right. And it's not a stunt shark and they never will. They don't understand anything with it. All they know is what's in front of them. Eat, eat, what's in front of him, eat whatever we eat with them. Used to eating well, they used to eat. There's some people that have, I don't know what it is, I don't know what they're doing, but they managed to not get killed. I think if you get into the water, the shark doesn't see you as prey as much as it sees you if you're on the top of the water. I think the top of the water is a big danger because people look like seals. That's one. One thing when you're down in the water, I think you're more of a weird curiosity. He looked like a swimming monkey water and it, oh good. I get a snack. It's, it's hard to figure out probably what the fuck you are. You know? I think

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       the animals that are that stupid, they just sort of get by doing the same shit over and over and over again. And for sharks, it's like, look for seals. Boom, looked for seals, boom, look for seals. Whoa, what the fuck is this? Surfboard? It's tastes terrible. You know, this tastes like Arby's. Get this fucking Guy Adam, my marriage. But if you like, look at them, man, you look at their, their black dead eyes and you look at their, you know, their body is just designed to just chew or there's not a lot of thinking going on. We had this conversation earlier about what it means to be a hunter, but wouldn't it be hunting really if you were like in a rowboat with like a Harpoon going after one of them and not like, you know, and like a giant vessel shooting at them with a high powered rifle as they were in a little boat.

Speaker 5:          00:21:31       You're going to die. You're not going to beat a great white shark, but all right. All right. We're talking about, you want to get extreme right now. I don't mean like any kind of shark, the shark or that's big a tiger shark. I guess maybe like a six footer. If you're really good with a spear, you gotta get like four or five and, but if he flips you in the water man, most likely you're fucked. I mean, I just depends on what kind of boat you're, if you're in their element, that's a cheating thing anyway. If you're in a boat, you're cheating. If you have anything out, if you have anything. Yeah, actually cheated. Everyone can act. You like drop all those weapons and just go flesh to flesh. Yeah. You got no chance. Don't have teeth. Like y'all Niggas do have hands. That doesn't, the shark skin note is when you feel it.

Speaker 5:          00:22:12       It, when you rub it one way, it's like completely rough and we'll cut your skin and then when you go from back to front, it's completely, absolutely silky smooth. Yo when we were little kids, we had like a dissection program. And the last, uh, the last thing that we did was like third grade or something, but they cut open a shark and we had to take his kids out like it's children. And when you felt the shark, they said watch. And the science teacher rubbed his hand nose to the back and his hand was cut open. And he said that what the normal normal sharks do is they just swim through a school of fish. And since this skins built like that, whatever they touch, they cut. And then on the second loop around they can smell the blood or they can see one of the fishes that they've cut and go through it.

Speaker 5:          00:22:54       But if you touch the shark normal shot from like, you know, back to front, it's totally silky smooth. Wow, that's weird. Why would it be silky smooth that way? That seems strange because I think that thing, it's just like a jagged sort of thing. I have no idea if they can pull it in and pull it out, you know? I mean, there must be some mechanism. All I know is that, hey man, I don't want to get rubbed up on by them. I don't want to pull, I don't want them to pull anything in. I'm pulling anything out on me. Getting in the water with sharks, playing civil, if you will. There's a big issue now in Australia, you know, because they're calling the sharks. They're killing a lot of great whites because they've had so many people die recently. They're just like, enough is enough. Too many people are getting attacked by sharks. Like we've got to kill some of these fucking sharks, and a lot of people think it's bad idea. Those people are assholes. Fucking

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       crazy. Assholes knows a lot of bad idea or the sharks killing people. Yeah, well you know what? Is there a EH wrong? Our planet suck it. If there's a bunch of sharks out there that are killing people, it's time to start killing sharks, period. Anybody who wants to argue is a fucking anti-American. It's going on in Australia. They support terrorism. Is that what goes on, Joe Rizzo? A shark. You're down with the enemy. That's the ultimate, not the NSA. It's on our ultimate enemy or ultimate enemy or fucking sharks. You know, it's funny, with all the shit that they listened to, I'm always surprised that we still have old kidnapping serial killers. You figured if they were tapping everybody's phone, they could find anybody that they want it. Yeah, they would look at everybody's phone. I just killed my seven Tucker. Lol. You know, like look at this mother fucker just texted his friend.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       Who knows, dude, someone someone's going to slip up. Oh, well there's most certainly have. I'm, I'm sure they've used it. I mean, if the, if it's been around as long as they say it's been around. When you hear about the, uh, the actual coding of the NSA software and how they first started doing it, there was a guy there, original NSA whistleblower. I should pull this guy up and give him his props because it's a pretty fascinating story because he was a, he was a whistle blower a long time ago and he was the guy that was responsible for making the software. And He, when he, when he was making the software, he was telling everybody like, hey, you can't use this to just spy on everybody. So he started doing all these interviews. Um, but it was before Edward Snowden that so everybody, everybody thinks of Edward Snowden as the original, uh, NSA whistleblower.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       But there was another guy before that. There was another guy in 2002, I believe. He came out and, uh, yeah, here it is. Bill Binney and, uh, this fucking guy told people about this a long time ago. There's a story of it on Youtube, on, uh, the RT America channel. That's Bill Binney, B, I, N, n, e, y, and a, he was a u s intelligence official. And you worked for the NSA and he turned into a whistle blower in a October 31st, 2001 after more than 30 years with the agency. He was a high profile critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration and was subject to an FBI investigations, of course, including a raid on his home. Of course, fucking thugs. Where's he at? Where's he doing time now? He's not, he's not doing time. That's what's crazy. Where is he? Because he called this before they did it, whereas Edward Snowden called it while it was happening.

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       So Edward Snowden got in trouble. This guy was predicting the future and he was saying that when he found out that they were able to spy on everyone and that they were using this system, uh, the, the system that was a, it was initially called trailblazer and uh, it was a, a system intended to analyze data carried on communications networks such as the internet, including social networks. Yes. And he found out that they were actually, they were starting to do it on there. They were just trying to do with everybody and he called it, he said that's their plan. Their plan is to monitor every email, every phone call. And he said, the guy, you know, he said, look, this is unamerican. And the guy stuck his neck out there. He got away with it though. It's really interesting because he just predicted it and you know, he wasn't actually talking about something that had happened, but he got out of the NSA and said, this is going on. You know what's crazy though?

Speaker 5:          00:27:15       So for the first couple of years, I mean making music. People used to call me a conspiracy theorist and I always used to laugh and I'd be like, all right, well let's play it down. Let's, let's Encyclopedia Brown this bitch right now and tell me what is my conspiracy that the government spies on you? I was right about that. You know, I released a record talking about how you know we're going to war for false reasons, that this is a false premise to be in war. Okay, well we found out that no weapons of mass destruction, I never said that Bush was directly responsible for nine 11 I said that I never believed that government's version because they couldn't even tell the truth about the air to breathe. I always felt like the story was in complete what's, what's the conspiracy theory? That's absolutely fucking true.

Speaker 5:          00:27:54       Now we find out that there are layers upon layers upon layers of what's going on in the world. I said it, the government itself was involved in the drug trade in Peruvian cocaine. So people said, oh my God, how can you use this conspiracy theory? Really? And now we find out that they protect certain Mexican cartels, it as long as they sell out to other homeys. The absolute truth of the drug game here in America is they don't go after the little fish to get the big fish. You know what I mean? They want the big fish so he can rat out all the little fish and they can all spend time in the jail because only the main dude has the $10 million attorney. So I mean, I don't blame this guy for just being fed up and saying, hey man, this is exactly what's going on or what's going to go on in the future. I'm just surprised that somebody hasn't found a way to give him cancer assumption and kill him off in a way that doesn't raise that much suspicion.

Speaker 1:          00:28:45       Like I said, he did it so long ago, right before it ever became a public issue that he quit in 2001 and that's when he started talking and doing all these interviews. Um, you know what it is in three nine 11, 2001 post nine 11. It's when he quit. Look, the dude is essentially, I mean he's a real patriot. That's what he is. He's a guy who was working in the, in the office of, he's working for the defense of the country in the right way. I mean, that's what he's doing. He's, he, he doesn't, he wants there to be like laws. He wants there to be protection of rights as well though he wants us to be able to go after terrorists, but he doesn't think the government should be able to just willy nilly looking at everybody's fucking emails. But the government shouldn't, shouldn't become a terrorist in the process of going after terrorists. Exactly. And you're torturing random people

Speaker 5:          00:29:35       full in order to do that. Then you are becoming the terrorists themselves. And then there's no distinction really, because one is a, is a hidden danger that people are terrified of. And the other one is exactly the same thing. A hidden danger that people are terrified from someone in power. He says, you know what? I don't like this guy. I don't like Rogan. You know he's talking about the ATF. That's my business. You know what? I want you guys to ruin his fucking life. I want you to go after him. You know it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:01       Well, it's been proven that they do that with the IRS, right? They use the IRS to go after political enemies. I mean there, there are a lot of fucking hedge rolled because of that shit cause it got public. Yet people have this, there's a lot of no nonsense people out there. That's the real issue. There's a lot of people like harsh. You believe in big foot, you believe in conspiracy theories swollen. What do you think the government's out to get you? There's a lot of these people that like to pretend that it's foolish to think that the government is involved in anything shady ever. And if they're always above ground, they have too much power. Whenever you get groups of people that have that much power, when you have essentially the power to create laws, the power to to go in to the the very laws that were established in the beginning of this nation and change them so that you can get away with shit that would ordinarily be illegal, right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:50       Like all those things are only done by people who have too much power. They're not in, they're never things that people vote on, nobody of the people who never vote to give themselves less rights and people never vote to give more trust in the government. And the government's just sort of takes it slowly but surely in the best way to take it is to tell you there's a bunch of enemies they have to protect you from. It's a timeless age old trick. And the idea that that's a conspiracy theory is ignoring all of human history from the jump, everything ever done by people with guns, swords or arrows, right? Everything ever done was done with deception. It was done by establishing enemies and protecting you from those enemies. They're they're timeless techniques and the idea that the greatest government conquer that. We would stop doing that in 2014 that after all they've learned after all these years they go, you know what, all that time tested shit. We're going to set it aside and we're going to be ethical. We're going to do, we're going to be the ethical

Speaker 5:          00:31:46       because we're bomb was in office. Now we're going to be ethical. I, but there were people who believed in his fairy tale and I did it. I wanted to,

Speaker 1:          00:31:54       I wanted, I wanted to get in and go gotcha pitches. I was fucking child of a single mom. I was smoked weed is

Speaker 5:          00:32:02       there, I remember in Harlem when he was elected and it was like pandemonium. I Shit you not that it, it just so happened that they were moving like a subway car. I'm pretty big deal. People will usually want to see him in the street. But they were moving a subway car via like a tractor trailer and they were moving it through one 25th from one side to another. And they had a jumbo tron set up by like the state building and he gave his address and there were like hundred thousand people in the street right there. And they followed the procession of the subway everywhere. I saw an old lady get out of her car and start dancing, you know what I mean? And she was just like, look in she, she must have been like 80 years old. And I was like, Yo, my grandma, if you see so happy, she's like, you know, you got to understand, I grew up in a time where people looked at me like I wasn't a fucking human being.

Speaker 5:          00:32:54       And to see that, I mean, look, I always discuss the, these, these variations of oppression because people try to liken what happens to Africans and native to native Americans to other struggles and other people being oppressed. But you know what, you, you can't you no one ever tried to, for example, kill somebody else from another group because they knew how to read. You know what I mean? Like these things were specifically done to a people to try and take away from the legitimacy that they have to dehumanize because that's the only way to really do something that negative to someone. You have to find some sort of different way to define them as a person so that then you can justify it, not just to yourself but to other groups of people. You know, normal people won't be like, Hey man, I'm just going to kill this person and take their land and their gold and their oil or whatever it is.

Speaker 5:          00:33:45       But now it's like, oh my God, no. These people and the way they are are wicked and their wickedness is going to spread to the rest of us so much. Well, we have belief systems, man and belief systems. Once they're in place, they can be really scary. You know, if you have a belief system that this group that you're going after or all evil and God is on your side and they need to be smitten from the earth. But that's on our side. Yeah. That's the other one. God on your side. And that's what I think turns a lot of people off about religion. It's not, there's no personal response as much as you know, the, the, the right wingers that are our religious scream about, oh, we want people and not get out. I have personal, why don't you take some personal responsibility? You know, don't, don't put it on God.

Speaker 5:          00:34:28       Put her on you. You feel uncomfortable with this being this way or you, you don't like these people for some reason. Or maybe you've actually done the history and you know that these people have a legitimate reason to be unhappy with this government or know that they've been treated unfairly in some way, shape, or form. And I think there's a difference between being angry, angry, and having holy anger and having a righteous anger, you know? And, and being angry for reason, not just being upset and feeling like your quote unquote the victim, but technically looking at a situation and saying, no, I was treated unfairly and you know what I was taken advantage of. And I think from the time that people had been a caveman to, you know, tomorrow all anger comes from being treated unfairly or the perception that you're treated unfairly. Anything lied to you, treated me unfairly.

Speaker 5:          00:35:12       You told, you told someone else the truth, but you told me a lie. You know you stole from me, you treated me unfairly, I let you into my house, I protected you and you fucking repaid me by robbing me. All of that comes back to it. And I just think that if this government is even going to survive, it really has to address the amount of cynicism that exists in America right now. Because that was the whole point. I thought of Obama coming in, the idea that people were so cynical about a government under Bush that saw McCain as an extension to that. They were like, oh my God again, another one. Well, who are we going to go to war with now? But then when he came in, he was supposed to be, you know, the, the, the great unifier, but he turned into a great pacifier.

Speaker 5:          00:35:50       He was just like, okay, cool, everything's going to be good. I'm going to, Oh, I'm going to intellectualize all of this and make it seem rational, you know, so I'll get away with a whole bunch of shit that if Mitt Romney had been elected or if McCain had been elected and done the exact same shit that he did, they would have gone crazy. They, where are the people that are more marching on Washington to, to go against the war? We're at a now. That's why, you know, I keep it real Rogan. I do a lot of activism. We did a show yesterday to raise money for people that were victims of that typhoon in the Philippines, you know, and it's going straight to them because of working with grassroots organizations. But a lot of times when I see these big activist groups and they come up to me and I'm just like, Yo, where the fuck are you now?

Speaker 5:          00:36:31       You know, you were all waving your flag, you know, when it was the Bush era, but now that Obama was in power, you don't want to make any waves, you know? Now I see people on Msnbc. You're advocating a war in Syria. You don't even know what the fuck is going on. You know, you don't know anything about the history of that struggle. You know the thing anybody, uh, about the, the, the, the, the idea of what's going to actually happen once they get attacked and they have to call their clients. I mean, there are clients, state of Russia, there a vassal of Russia now. They basically sold themselves off because of the chemical weapons thing. They said, all right, we'll give you the chemical weapons then you and the UN, we'll deal with that personally. It enables them to say, all right, we're going to be partners forever and ever as long as Russia exists, Syria will be here.

Speaker 5:          00:37:12       And that's the deal that they had to make. And there are plenty of people who made that deal with America. As long as they exist, man will be good. But as soon as America is endanger guests, what my ass is in danger too. You know, there are plenty of places like Guam, America holds on to Puerto Rico like it's balls. Israel, I'll tell you right? Puerto Rico is one of the weirdest ones, right? Because it's sort of a state, but not really a state. Well, it's a commonwealth, right? It received, it received a charter of independence from Spain in like 1898 and literally the next year the USS Maine exploded. But when people did research, you know, decades later they found out the ship imploded, exploded from the inside. And ironically, here's another interesting tidbit. All of the white officers were on the land when the ship exploded and the only people on the ship were like the deck hands and the people of color. And

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       Are you implying that someone in the government blew up that ship, sir, is that she has never happened before. Remember the USS Maine, that's what they say. That's never even been planned. There's a lot of people that feel that the Bush administration had planned a false flag on Iran, but that's false because the Bush administration was awesome and if they did plan it it would have happened. So you don't know what the fuck you talking about? They were perfect. They had god on their side. God got underside side. Yo, I swear to God,

Speaker 5:          00:38:36       there was so many times when I've seen people, like when I go to colleges and there's some preacher dude like in front of the college arguing with the atheists and I always ask him, I'm like, Yo Dude, do you do you believe in the president? And he said, I absolutely support, you know, President Bush. I was like, what? What would he have to do to lose your support? Like what, what, what sort of things would he have to abuse? Could he kill someone and still gain your support? You know when the guy was like, well that depends who, and I'm just like, wait a minute, do what? Do you be mid? Depends who the v ordered the deaths of some people overseas who aren't Christians, he's forgiven, but if he like shot someone next door who he went to church with me, he should burn in hell forever. I mean at that point I think the select of morality is what bothers a lot of people about religion in general. It's just like, okay cool. I'm only going to care about the lives of certain human beings because they share the same belief system of mine, but the moment that you don't, then I feel so threatened by your existence that I don't care if your children live or die.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       Well, you heard the, the latest revelations about the NSA that they were ordering drone strikes based on metadata. They were ordering drones, tribes based on GPS, location of phones that they were tracking. So they, they might not have even known that the guy that they were looking for was inside the building and they just randomly targeted buildings where these phones existed. You know? That's if that's true, that means they just said, okay, well we're going to have to kill a whole bunch of fucking people to get this phone right.

Speaker 5:          00:40:07       Fun that he may not even be, he'll hold my phone today, man.

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       Yeah. Uh, the, the whole thing here, I'll pull it up because, uh, they were, they did a story of it on, um, on Rt. Yeah. Use of NSA metadata defined drone. Target kills. That's crazy. Kill civilians. They would find these, I mean, this is really hard to believe, but they would find these people by the location of their phone and then send in the missiles. Jeez. That's, that's evil shit. Wow. That's really evil shit. And I know there's bad people in the world for sure, but that is not in any way, shape or form the way to handle it. There's gotta be a better way to kill people because there's bad people that you have to kill. You can't just kill everybody around them. That shit's crazy. You'll turn everybody against you a well, you or I'm against you. We should all be against, right. It's murder. You're a murderer. You're, you're just murdering people in a way that is sanctioned.

Speaker 5:          00:41:06       But what strikes me about that is that this government has no problem doing that anyway. They call it collateral damage. They say, okay, you know, we have, we have a military target. It happens to be near a school. You know what, that's collateral damage. Anybody could even think about doing something like this though with the metadata that's like insane, extreme collateral damage. It's insane. That's how they feel about it.

Speaker 1:          00:41:30       Glenn Greenwald, uh, is that the guy, uh, who put this out? I liked that guy. I liked him too. My friend Sam Harris hates his guts though. Why? He thinks Sam Harris is a anti Islam. Uh, he's t Sam Harris is a neuroscientist, is an author and he's, he's pretty strong proponent of atheism. Right? And, uh, this guy, Glenn Greenwald, thinks that he's got an anti Muslim, uh, agenda, anti Islam agenda.

Speaker 5:          00:41:59       You know what's interesting, I had this discussion with somebody about atheism and their way of dealing with, um, different cultures and societies. You can totally be an atheist to be racist. It's like me, you know, you can be a feminist and you can be racist. That's ridiculous to think that those two things can't coexist in the same being. My thing is this, when I hear people like Darwin, sorry, Richard Dawkins and people who are Darwinists, um, have conversations. What's interesting to me is the, the, the level of civilization that they'll attribute to like white Christian society. And even though they'll say it's barbaric, it's still not as barbaric as those dark brown people's cultures because they're even more dangerous. And my thing is this ticks, right? My thing is this, it's like if someone says allow walk bar before they go into war, and that is the, the, the benchmark to say that this is, you know, a religious killing.

Speaker 5:          00:42:54       Then what about all the soldiers of America who say the Lord's prayer before they go into combat? Isn't that interpreted as, Oh man, Jesus helped me kill these motherfuckers. Really? Then you're making a sacrifice then is Christ a blood God to you or is it a god of peace? That's the question that I have to ask. And that is the part where, you know, when I speak to people who are atheists who don't believe in in theism and stuff like that, you have to separate that from actual historians and people who have studied the history of religion and the history of different cultures and societies to say which one is more so called civil to one another because I think we've fallen to this idea of the civilized savage. You know the idea that certain cultures brought civilization to other people. Nobody ever brought civilization to anybody. Civilization is the act of being civil to one another. When you take somebody else's shit and then you say, Oh, guess what? You're going to use our way of doing things now rather than yours. You didn't civilize anybody. You just took them over and you enslave them in a very polite way sometimes and sometimes in a not so very polite way. Cause colonization is too nice of a word for rape. Genocide and fucking, yeah. Is it ever summation of population?

Speaker 1:          00:44:01       Has anybody ever taken over a country? Nice. It's always not so nice. I mean the, the, the horrors that happen in this country alone when it's hard to believe that just a couple of hundred years ago, all this stuff wasn't here and I need a couple hundred years ago is nothing. It's a blink of an eye.

Speaker 5:          00:44:16       Well that's what we used to get an argument. We may have talked to us about this on the first show when people were like, oh, you know, the aliens had to help those people back in the day. And I was like, Yo dude, if they helped them, you know, for the over the course of 10,000 years build a pyramid, then maybe they helped

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       you because about 200 years ago you were driving a horse and carriage and now you've got a rover on Mars, so you got a little boost to from the aliens buddy. You know what I mean? I think that it's just ridiculous to assume one culture had communication in one culture, couldn't possibly add if they've been here and they've been here the whole time. Well, if, if it is possible that we were ever visited by aliens, who knows? Maybe it takes a long fucking time to get here. Maybe they can only come here once or twice in a generation. I don't know. They set up shop here dude, that if that's the case, wouldn't there be levels of aliens? Just like there's levels of human civilization, like human civilization goes from having a horse and buggy to having a car to having an airplane. Wouldn't alien civilization go from there to maybe some of them reach us and these are like the real ghetto aliens that are barely getting their shit together out there in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       They're not, they don't have any fucking alien comes like, what are you doing? Very sketchy science. They fucking blow up. Sometimes. Those are the guys who crashed at Roswell. They'll like, they're more advanced than us, but there's still kind of fucked up. And then there's dudes that are so far advanced than them that they make them look like cave people. And these people don't no longer have bodies and they travel interdimensionally and they, they exist. That's what, that's what I think it's like a big too, like there's no saying like what dimension they're in. You know what I mean? Or how our eyes are calibrated, what we are, what we can or can't see. Well, I mean I used to be really attracted to the idea that aliens came and helped people. I was very, very attracted to the idea and I'm still attracted to it because I think it'd be insanely fascinating because it really follows what human beings would do if we, if we were super advanced and we came to a planet and we found some primitive life forms, for sure we would drop off some of our fucking Jizz.

Speaker 1:          00:46:11       We would definitely give them some of our DNA. We're gross. We thought we could touch this world in some way. We decided to do that. He did fuck the Avatar, didn't he? Yes. Side big blue cat. Think about what we're talking about doing the Mars. Is that beastiality hold on. That's interspecies beastiality cause they talk. It's just you're fucking an alien. No, no, it's not BC. I don't know. It's interspecies. It's not beastiality isn't the fuck aliens man. Shit fucking be. We're calling her an animal. We don't know what her final animal, she talks. Should we establish that shit back in star trek when Kirk, fuck that green check. I remember that. That was it. That's precedent. It's legal presence. She didn't have the girl didn't have a tail. I don't give a fuck dude. She had like a nose, like a cat. Dude's hot.

Speaker 1:          00:46:57       You mother fucker. I fucked that Avatar Bitch. But at the end of the my respect that, yeah. By the end of the movie, I wanted to live. I wanted to live with the Navi in the trees. I wanted to be camping and shooting arrows and fly. So it was taking the consensus are jre that fucking a 10 foot tall cat. What bitch is not beastiality. What about the planet of the apes? When they cut the scene, they were supposed to read the market mark version joint. You're supposed to be a scene where he was having sex with the eight. No. Yeah. Do they filmed it and they were saying, is it BCI? He's like, it it. Is it wrong

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       to be interspecies you know what I'm saying? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:47:33       yeah. Listen, it's okay to fuck hot aliens. I'm gonna say it right now. If a hot alien comes to visit me in the middle of the night, if I get away with it, I'm gonna fuck her. I respect that. I'm not mad at her dad [inaudible] but what if there he's looked like hers. Oh, topsy turvy world. Oh Man. What if the intonation, everything was perfect, right? Except that she had a really deep voice. Like I fucked a few smokers and my day really hot chick with a big edge voice. They're just ready to take you under their wing. I'll take care of it. She's hot. I'll deal with it. I'm totally just never talked to her on the phone. My thoughts,

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       thoughts on aliens visiting with people though that people don't really understand how long a hundred years is. We think of like 400 years ago. It was being like, wow, 400 years ago, you know, back then they didn't have cameras. Back then they didn't have automobiles. Everybody rode horses and then 400 years before that, in 400 years before that, you stop and think about what we were talking about with Egypt. You're talking about a culture that existed for thousands of years, thousands, thousands of years and the, obviously we're smart as fuck. They wrote down a lot of shit. Just what they left behind. Forget about what was found during the burning of the library of Alexandria. I mean they, when they found that they destroyed all these like ancient records and all this information about how they did their, their construct, I mean who knows what the fuck was in there when they burnt all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:49:05       But what these burned several times. Yeah, but what the, yes, it was what they left behind though carved in the stones. It's magnificent shit. I mean all their high rig lifts there did the beautiful works of art. They left behind like the symmetry of their buildings and the mathematics. They're construction. It's so obvious. There were super, super advanced people, like they were really advanced. And we just think of that as being like, well, there's no way aliens must did it. No, it's real possible that a human race, a human culture can get super advanced and fuck it all up and it could be fucked up by disease and it can be fucked up by asteroids and it can be fucked up by other humans invading them, which would happen to Egypt. They got invaded by the Nubians and the Nubians took older. That's why the older fair though, than the more recent Pharaoh's all had black African faces like the Pharaoh in the face of the Sphinx is a very distinctly different face than some of the more Sephardic pharaohs that you saw, like in the early days. Right. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:50:05       And the other thing is this, that Egypt initially begin, um, as a society that rose from other places, you know what I mean? There were other civilizations that predated it such as Sumeria, things of that nature. And when you look at it, yes, of course they could have easily took from those civilizations as well. Sure. We took from other civilizations for sure. We took from, from tribes and from other view, I mean our constitution itself is based on an air coy confederacy and something that people don't really realize or pay attention to that yes, we didn't just get corn from indigenous people. We got this idea that different places could be under the same federal state, but still guests what have laws of their own that are respected by the federal gov or forceful that, that they are forced to respect because this is a different tribes and these tribes are not going to tolerate you telling them how to live. However, we will combine forces for the survivability of all of us together as opposed to individual tribe.

Speaker 1:          00:51:03       Wasn't that the whole forming of the constitution as well? I mean, didn't they get the ideas in the constitution from studying the, the great, um, the great civilizations of the past like Rome and Greece and all their ideals about how society should be put together and use those ideas and a lot of ways to formulate the constitution?

Speaker 4:          00:51:22       Well, I mean, Napoleon civil code also influenced a lot of western societies. Europe's legal system now, but I think you know, when we talk about whether it's aliens or whether it's anybody that interferes in, in a human society, you want to think that, what would their agenda be? What do they want? What could they possibly have to gain for all of it? Resources, land. I mean, if you read the Bible that says that, you know, the, the, the sons of heaven made it with the daughters of men. You know, who's to say that's angels. Maybe that's, we came down to fuck a woman.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       It's absolutely possible that it did happen. I know people don't like to hear that look all great. You believe in aliens. That's not even what I'm saying. I'm saying it's absolutely possible because this fucking thing is so big. It's so big. The idea that we've never been visited before is silly. But if we pay attention to the way we treat the things on this planet that we can control and we think about how the fuck they would deal with us, we should be probably pretty happy that it is bullshit. Because if there are anything like us, I wouldn't, I wouldn't put it past them creating us at a monkeys. I wouldn't put it past some super advanced alien species. Look at some stupid chimps and go get these dumb mother fuckers. Let's take some of our shit and put it into then and then come back in a thousand years.

Speaker 1:          00:52:39       All my God, they got planes and buildings and who knows? It is possible that that happened. It sounds quite ridiculous. Don't worry. I know that and I know it sounds it, but I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm not saying it's likely. It's certainly there's, there is a chance that this planet has been visited before. Just the fact that we can go to Mars with a drone. We know that we sent these manned vehicles into space. We know that their satellites in orbit, we've used the space shuttle. We've used rockets there. There's, without a doubt a rover that's moving around on the Mars right now. If a vis a rover moving around on Mars, we sent it from this planet. We're monkeys. I mean, we're a couple of hundred years removed from slavery in this country.

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       We just came up with the Internet 20 years ago. We already have a robot moving around on Mars. If there's something else out there that's a hundred years, a thousand years more advanced than us, if they haven't blown themselves up for sure they would send some shit our way. If they came here a long, long ass time ago, the universe is 13 point whatever billion years old. Allegedly earth is only 4.6 billion years old. I mean that's there's a hell of a long, it's a long time. That window that leaves nine fucking billion plus years that someone else could have been in a much more stable solar system, developed a civilization that's not based on dominator culture. Empires figured out of boulder and that they might've had it completely psychedelic culture like from the jump they were eating mushrooms never got out of it. They might live in a tropical climate, like the whole planet might be a stable tropical climate where they're consistently engaging in mushroom use and they, they developed the ability to read each other's minds, it like a fucking thousand years into their civilization and they'd just been rocking it freestyle since then.

Speaker 4:          00:54:26       And here they are 10 billion years older than you know this planet. But if we are like a downgraded version of humans, then human humans like 4.0 must be really frightening creatures. Oh, it's something that can like look into your mind and see you control things at the head and the people who don't necessarily believe this, but who won't even subscribe to the possibility. These are the same people that think that laws hold our country together rather than the iron fist of a talking monkey. Well, there, there's what holds this shit hurt me. I will destroy you if you break these things that I've written about the NSA whistleblower. The fucking FBI breaks into his house. Get on the floor trader. I heard a word to that when you were talking. Um, there's a woman named Dr. Karen Mason. She has a talking about the evolution of the species and uh, she says that there are hurt.

Speaker 4:          00:55:15       There we is, that we're all homo erectus because we walk up. Right. But there's also different people on this planet that a call home on noetic is meaning that they have more than just the five senses that people have. So we're not all the same species. Some people are more devolved or evolved than others. So you can't say that though, man. People will accuse your racism, but no, no, no, no. Don't say that. You can't say that there's some people are just dumber. No, no. Different species of people. Meaning that you could, you know how sometimes you could just think of a friend and they'll call you? Well, how about this just don't, there's no term too. It's not, it's not so much dependent on the ideas of compartmentalizing people in the way we do in terms of race or in terms of religion. It wouldn't be like to say that one person of this color or this is not even holler creed would have been smarter. It would have been a specific individual that's born within that line. Either. It could be here in America, it could be in Mexico, it could be in Nigeria or Scandinavia somewhere, but for example, there are types of intelligences that we really do appreciate in this country. We look at science and math and we say, oh man, you're really smart. You know you're going to

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       be a fucking engineer. But people don't appreciate social intelligence, emotional intelligence. You know? Imagine somebody that's able to come into a room and they look at you and they like, you know what, Joe? Joe Walks different today. That means he sad. You know what I mean? Or you know, he, he's worried about something. Or you know, when he's, when he's checks his phone a lot, he only key only interrupts the podcast to speak to his chalk child or something. So something must be wrong at home. People who pick up on those things, right? It's, it's, it's incredibly, it's not like female intuition, that sexist bullshit. It's the idea that people in general, male, female, whatever, some of them are just more in touch with the idea of giving a fuck about how the people around them exist and therefore they're just a more, I wouldn't say a more considerate human being, but they have more emotional and to pay more attention to developing that musical intelligence.

Speaker 5:          00:57:13       For example, people could say, all right, I hear a note that's a g sharp. Now I'm going to create a whole song around it and it's already finished in my head. That's a musical genius. Physical intelligence. People who say, you know you, you MMA shit, God damn it. That's physical intelligence. Anyone who's got a fight in the ring in and calibrate and exact punch or know how to move somebody or to to to step them in this direction other, that's an incredible physical genius that they have to possess in order to carry on something like that and not kid knocked the fuck out by someone's swing on you as hard as they possibly can, but only certain intelligences are valued in this country and in the world in terms of human society as opposed to delving into what they would really be if we took them each at not just face value, but what they represent for our human culture.

Speaker 5:          00:58:00       You know some, I know that's why some people fuck with animals more than they fuck with people. I know people that they're like, oh, I love my dog. Why can't you love a dog more than a person? Sometimes a dog is more human being than a human. You know, you got a homeless person in the street who's crying you. Most people will walk right by him. You put your dog next to a homeless person was fucking and tears. Somehow. I've seen it. My dog that doesn't like nobody will go over there like, hey man, like kind of look at you like sad. Like why are you sad? Why are you hurting? Who the fuck would do that? As a normal person, we're trained to ignore that. Whereas something like a dog is trained to say, hey man, no, someone, someone's in pain that's not right. As if to say, I wish I could help you if I wasn't trapped in this fucking body.

Speaker 1:          00:58:45       You know what happens when people start really paying attention to a lot of homeless people and hanging out with them? You realize the fucking crazy and if you bring those mother fuckers in your life, your life is going to be chaos. Can we take that crazy crying lady underneath the bridge and say, come on, come on on my house, Doug. Stan help used to do that. You know what happened? They got in a knife fight and it's fucking driveway. Uh, the woman's stabbed her boyfriend. Yeah. Doug, you still let him, he had a front lawn. He lived in. Nobody's saying you got to breastfeed them. I'm just saying that you're saying, I know what you're saying. It's a very romanticized ideal that the reality is we want to go out there and fucking bring homeless people in your life every day. You only got 24 hours in a fucking [inaudible] up with it all.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       Shit be screaming and crying. No, no soap. Look, hey, you're on fucking shit together or you're crazy. It's one of those two, and if you, if you crazy, that's the real issue that when the Reagan administration was here, they, they changed the laws. They changed the, the standards as far as like taking people that you had to take care of and they let a lot of people out of mental hospitals that were, they were infirmed for life and they got him out and then these people were just like, free. You're free. You're on your own. If you could take care of yourself,

Speaker 5:          00:59:48       but then again, when we think about it, then let's take that then and then let's not make it romanticized. Idealized. If these people are sick, if they have a disease, then shouldn't they be taken care of? Shouldn't they be right? No question, no question. If someone had fucking pneumonia and they were lying on the fucking highway, some, uh, you called the ambulance, they would come get him. Somebody sitting there, there are schizophrenia, you know what I mean? Or they have multiple personality disorder. They're more liable to, to, to hurt themselves and they're their danger to themselves and to other people. Those people need to be taken care of. For example, I look at that, the way I look at drug addiction. Those people don't belong in prison for 40 or 50 years. They obviously need treatment. They need to be fixed, but we only give a fuck when it's a Phillip Seymour Hoffman that that dies.

Speaker 5:          01:00:33       And then when a, where are the rest of their heroin addicts? You know, I went off on Twitter the other day because I was like, Yo Dude, you know, the NYP ds investigating who sold them the hot dose. Really, you know, I know lots of people I've known through my life that either almost died or died of a damn heroin overdose or some kind of drug overdose and the NYP d didn't go meticulously looking for the specific dealer. You want to know where the heroin is coming from, homie? I told them you can go first stop. You need to do is Afghanistan. That's where it's coming from. And the poppy fields are being protected by our troops because the war lords that we want to stay in power that are willing to give us access are the ones that need the money. So we allowed them to grow the poppy and we disallow. The Taliban supported it too.

Speaker 1:          01:01:16       But listen, don't bring any homeless people in your house. Trust me. I know he's saying that all make sense? But you got to trust. Had a background in comedy. Don't watch it. Come in your house. They don't even know what toilet paper is. Dude, fix everybody that's close to Valentine's Day. I know he can't be captain. Save a hoe. You can't. You can't be that guy. I'll tear. We're trying to fix the world. Nice to that. God did a problem is the really fucking crazy people. You're not going to fix. You could, you could work all day everyday for the rest of your life and you wouldn't put a dent in that shit. And I think that they have to someone hallmark of our society.

Speaker 5:          01:01:56       It's a question. Do you think those people started that way or do you think it was the things that happened to them within the course of their life more often? That makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:02:03       You would be crazy to assume either or. You're, you know, no one has any idea what the background of a lot of those people are other than the people that have treated them in the past, they probably don't even know what the fuck happened to them. There's a lot of really sick people out there that just happened to be homeless people because we can't, we can't them as insane enough to institutionalize. Not, not then to be crazy enough to try to define it, but wouldn't you think that the majority of these cases of people who had extreme trauma of some sort as a child? I would imagine. Yeah, I would imagine. Well, you know, abuse people, people that have been homeless, I've met, I knew quite a few people that were homeless at the stages of their life from the time when I used to hang out in pool halls, one of my best friends was homeless for a long period of time when I was a struggling comedian.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       My friend Johnny was a pool hustler or legit hundred percent pool house and it a drug addict. But the pool hustler thing is how he got by. He was extraordinary pool player and he would pretend to sock and he would, he would go to places and he was a fast talker and he was a slick dude and he got a big thrill out of tricking guys into playing him. And then you know, he would like lose a little then complain and then they would start talking shit and calling them fat and all this different. And then it would slowly start playing better and they like make it real emotional with the guy and like he would get thousands of dollars at a people and a lot of it was psychological. He just knew how to play people. He had emotion tells motional intelligence, social intelligence and emotional intelligence.

Speaker 1:          01:03:28       He had both, but he was homeless a good portion of the time. Like sometimes he would come stay at my house. This motherfucker hadn't slept in days except under pool tables and he would just conk out. Like he got shot with a tranquilizer dart and just sleep for like he slept in my house for two solid days. Straight ones because he was just burning it best leave of his life probably. Yeah man. The dude, the poor dude was just out there and you know, and he had issues himself. He had a, a lot of mental health issues himself and I think that there's a lot of people out there that are homeless that have mental health, which I think that's the majority of a lot of the cases. I think a lot of the homeless people that have mental health issues, and what's sad is that, you know, especially when you find people who are supposed to be cared for by this government.

Speaker 1:          01:04:11       And it goes back to what we were talking about before and the imagine the veterans that are homeless out there who are paid dues and risk their lives to this country and they are completely looked over. And you would think the people who say that they love America so much wouldn't be the ones that are bleeding it dry. But ironically it's the people that are criticizing this country for the things it does wrong that love it the most. Why? Because we want to fix the things that are wrong as opposed to people that say, Hey, we just love America. And anything you say against America is wrong. No, that's not the case. Because the people who usually say that are the ones that are bleeding this country dry by saying, Oh man, I love America. You know, I want to destroy unions. Unions are destroying them.

Speaker 1:          01:04:50       You know what? I want to stop workers from doing this. Dude, you're not doing it because you love America. You love money. You know, if you really loved America, how come you've got a God damn plant overseas? You know you could be not making 10 billion. You could be making 7 million a year, but you would be feeding 10 times more people. You know here in America they would never do that. Of course you billion is a big number. I don't know what kind of country you live in and stuff, but that's what I'm talking about. Taxes. My 3 billion pays for social programs.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       Clean the streets. Who Do you want to build these bridges? That extra 3 billion is important, right? The only that they're not going to pay it in taxes either. It's not like it's when they go to anything and that's right. They weasel that shit. Yeah. I mean come on. The NFL is like a charity funnies things of all times. The NFL is tax free. Is it team by team though? Did I talk to the dude? The whole thing is a charity organization. Please get the fuck in the world. The UFC needs to get on that. I don't know what the Fuck Dana White's waiting for. We need to be tax free. We need to irrigate the UFC. Charity. Charity should be a charity. That's what I'm saying. Crazy shit. You imagine the UFC tried to become tax free. You know who else was like, oh my God, the NHL, they're tax free to get the fuck up and HR. That is hilarious. Mba. That is. No, but I think they get that they got to pay too many black people. They got to play it. They're not happy with this. 99% black people got dammit. Make them pay taxes. I mean he's baseball. They gotta pay to too many Latino, too many Latinos. These mother fuckers coming over here throwing heat coming up. Money, bitch, give me, yeah, taxes man. The people that don't have it have

Speaker 4:          01:06:40       to pay taxes. It's a real God damn mind blower. It's like, well how does that get determined and like religions that make money like religions, like say Scientology. Scientology is a tax people organization and tax free organization. That was written by a science fiction writer who l Ron Hubbard, who publicly stated that the best way to make a lot of money is to start your own religion. And he got tax free. That guy got tax rate. You know what's funny? When I got out of prison, I went to try and find a job and all these places and everyone said no to me and there was this one ad that was like, come learn the secret to life and get paid while doing it. And it was like a $12 an hour job and like 1999 when I just made parole and they were advertising like, please come to this area, you know you can learn.

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       And, and I walked in and it was a Scientology center course and I walked in. Lady was Super Nice. They're all the most polite, no, no, no, no. They just wanted to fucking sign. They literally just brought me in. They shoved me in front of a screen with like four or five other people and they played me like a Scientology video and then they will, they, they asked us, they were like, did you all understand the truth in this video? And I was, I was sitting, I was just like, Yo, I really want it to be like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Like no one believes this shit. But at the same time I sat back and I said, you know what, I really don't understand this religion enough for me to make a commitment about it right now. And they were very polite to me. They're like, thank you very much for your time, sir. Take care of, and it was somebody else in there who really needed that job and

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       they just looked at me and they would, they gave him this kind of look like, cool, cool. You're out in the running anymore. And there were like, I was touched. I had to swear to God, Yo, I could see the charlatan and the snake oil coming out of the side of the jacket. Dude. They were like, I was touched by this video. Like I really thought it was. I mean the dude, they're there to get a job. Yeah. That was it.

Speaker 6:          01:08:36       Joe. You, I looked at it. You might be right about this racist shit, by the way, because the only other ones that don't have to pay taxes, the golf league, the PGA and the NHL

Speaker 3:          01:08:46       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:08:51       all the owners that own a fellow daddy's fucking creep. The NBA should be pissed. Yeah. Doug Golf guys don't have to pay tax like the most money. Right? Wow. That's dark. That's dark racism. Wow. I think it's racism, crying racism for the NBA and I don't even watch basketball. Yeah. The idea that you could get away with the Scientology thing, that that could be, we need to start her own fucking religion. God dammit. That's how you're really good. That's how you're really locked down. That's the quote right there. When you're starting a religion, God dammit. Well, they have so much money that they can get away with it. Like Scientology is a number to land owner in Los Angeles. They own more buildings and property and real estate. In Los Angeles then like almost anybody.

Speaker 6:          01:09:43       The freakiest thing is, you know how they rope off everything at a time square when, uh, when the ball is going to drop or whatever and there's a certain time you can't go past the barricades. One night I was there and the guy said, well, you remember the Church of Scientology? And I said, yeah, and he let me in through the back through the barricade. Real Story. Dude. Real Story. He probably just wanted to fuck you.

Speaker 3:          01:10:04       [inaudible] handsome guy. [inaudible] came right out of just press a button. Whoa. You got to keep the ball moving.

Speaker 1:          01:10:31       What is the, wow, what are you supposed to say? Amazing. He probably loved you, dude. Scientologists try and make friends. He was a police officer too. That's hilarious. Well, they met. It might have some sort of a deal. Maybe they pay off the cops get, get through the line. I think that's the now brochures. That's the only way you really do get anything done. I think a lot for a lot of companies and corporations. They just pay off whoever it is that's in charge. Well, the only reason why people aren't investigating Scientology in this country, but yet they are in other countries. It's got to be just how much money they have. That's the one thing that makes sense. Because if it was a new group that came out of nowhere and they hadn't had all this history owning all these buildings

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       and you found out like that they had developed this religion based on the scientific or a science fiction authors writings and you would read it and go, wait a minute, what the fuck? What did these he meters, you hold onto these these aluminum cans and they tell me your personality. Get the fuck Outta here. That's not real. They would be shut down. You would think that they would be run out of town. Well, I mean someone else could tell you, hey, this cracker is really the flesh of, you know, a Hebrew Zombie. You know? I mean someone could put it in that way and you would feel ridiculous. As long as it's old, we're cool with it. No, but that's what I mean. As long as it's through a certain period of time. Look, I have a great respect for people who I've seen use religion to make them a better person.

Speaker 4:          01:11:54       Well, when I see someone become more pretentious, more judgmental, more like I have all the answers and unless you believe in exactly what I believe, then you're going to go to damnation. That's when I see religion as like a destructive thing that ends up ruining people's lives. But when I see people that honestly just take it, and I think that's the thing with a lot, with a lot of religions, as long as the Kennan can be as ridiculous as it's going to be, you know, people will believe preposterous things. All of the mask you to believe something preposterous. You know the, the ocean is divided, you know, of Muhammad ascended into heaven, you know what I mean? Or, or you know, Jesus Christ was born of a virgin and then died and came back to life. And yet when you look at people's lives, you know, some people's lives are preposterous.

Speaker 4:          01:12:37       You know, there was a, there was a family, my friend was staying and doing a photo project down in Brazil and he was down there and he was like, you know, there's a whole there, two holes in the floor. One hole is in the bathroom where everyone goes to the bathroom and the other hole is like literally right next door. And they put like a, like a bucket down there to catch shrimp. And I'm like, wait a minute, wait. So where is it like in a different river or something like nine, it's the same water. And I'm like, really? Like yeah definitely. It's the same exact water. And he's like, you have to understand that's the only way they're going to eat anything that day is to fish for shrimp in that shit water. And that's preposterous to me for you and I to look at that and be like, Oh man, you know who in this room would imagine, you know, I'm gonna put my hand in the toilet to pick up my dinner tomorrow.

Speaker 4:          01:13:21       But that is the absolute reality that people who are living in those types of dire conditions, cause if they don't eat that they're not going to fucking eat. That's why I'm honestly not offended if somebody, you know, steal someone. Oh, I'm in some third world country. I mean, not that I liked that shit, but yo, you're taking something because you're going to die if you don't sell it to eat. And motherfuckers just stealing, you know, Reebok pumps cause they want to look fucking cool. Like soccer. My Nigga, the only person I know that's ever actually started a religions, Alex Grey, Alex Gray is the visionary artist. I don't know if you've ever seen his work, but everything he does is the psychedelic portraits. They're, they're like these really intense, like a multicolored. They look like dimethyltryptamine trips. It's all like, uh, like Iowasca trips or mushroom trips and all of his art. This is the stuff coming out of people. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       This is all of his stuff. Well, he's, he's created his, not only is he created his own religion, but he got tax free status and his city is trying to, uh, to fight it. They still want them to pay taxes. I think, I don't know if he ever worked that out, but he's actually trying to do it in a, in a really like positive, healthy way. He's not trying to make money off people are own people or give you a bunch of rules that you have to follow. He's just essentially, he's a guy who really believes that psychedelics are a connection to the true God of the universe, love and God and, and you know, the, the energy that exists when you have these, uh, these powerful transformative psychedelic experiences. So he, um, he's building this thing in upstate New York. He came on and showed me and Brian, his, uh, his, uh, communities putting together up there, but he's got this huge building that he's making that he came on our podcast and did a Kickstarter for it and raise the money like in no time.

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       It was amazing. The people from this podcast fucking represented, like in as positive, a strong way as was humanly possible. And a whole bunch of people supported this and uh, he got all his funding and he's building this incredible building. Look at this thing. Look it up. Tech. It's on the other one behind in front of you too. That this is going to be, this is going to his church. Yeah. It's all based on his artwork and uh, it's like probably going to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. And where is he going to build this? And upstate New York. He has like, uh, he has, yeah, he has like a temple and I'm still going on something like a jungle in Columbia or some shit. You know what I'm telling you, the top of a mountain I met, I've met the dude several times and he is the real deal.

Speaker 1:          01:15:58       He really is a beautiful person. He's all full of love. The guy's like so loving and happy and friendly. He's not evil in any way, shape or form. And he just wants to promote those, those ideas and promote art. And, and, and promote love. I mean, you couldn't ask for a better guy trying to create his own religion, but what he's trying to do is you just influence people in a very positive way. She, Noah, Joe, it's usually never the guy who creates it. All, right? Always things. Heritage is always, it's always the inheritance. That's so true. Ever the fuck takes this shit over. It's going to be like, listen, you know, in order for you to really get the psychedelic experience [inaudible] shit. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:16:39       Let me father children with everyone's wife here. It just, they all do that, right? Eventually it was too hard to hot girls walking around. They love you so much because you're the Messiah Tam on it hit this fucking husband and hers. It's just fucking up my flow. Yeah, well that's just human nature, man. I mean that's obviously the issue with priest telling them they can't have sex. You know, you'd create monsters. He create monsters. When you suppress, there's no way around it. If you, if you suppress energy, finds a way he threw in another way. I really wouldn't do some in depth

Speaker 4:          01:17:11       research on when that started happening. Cause nearly Orthodox Church people who were um, officials of the church were allowed to have wives. They were allowed to have a dispensation. They were not to get married. They got married by the pope. I mean the Pope had children. I mean I think at some point people looked at it and probably in the Middle Ages where people got real pious and you know, when you examine the, the, the, the changing of Christianity, you find specific points where it becomes, you know, from that time where people are completely nonviolent to becoming structured, to be a violent society. You know, people say, oh well who, who, whose writings of those, I always said it was Saint Augustine and then it makes sense cause he dies in the siege of hippo. Regis. During that particular time, you know, the eastern Roman empire was trying to eradicate something called area aneurysm, which is the idea that the father is superior to the son. In other words, the father created the sun and therefore the sun was inferior to the father as he was a creation. The the people of the church hated this idea and so they overthrew all of the Germanic kingdoms that inherited the western Roman Empire in order to to to impose their idea of what Christianity would be, which if you think about it, would make that the first crusade ever. In terms of Christianity Celibacy,

Speaker 1:          01:18:28       there's, this is where it starts out celibacy. The first mandate requiring priest to be sell of it came in three o four a d so the year three Oh four Canon 33 of the council of Elvira, that is some Harry Potter Shit stated that all bishops press putters and deacons and all other clerics were to abstain completely from their wives and not to have children. Wow. A short time later and three 26 the council of Nicea convened by Constantine rejected a ban of priests marrying requested by Spanish clerics. Wow. This is fantastic. So they just decided they were saying too much dick. That's the only way around it. That's exactly what was going on. Does know they had too much power. There was no rock stars back then. You had poets, and by the way, when you're dealing with 3000 and you know, I mean 304 rather, there was no one was reading the Bible. They didn't figure out how to read the Bible until, till uh, till Martin Luther came along and translated it into a phonetic language. That was when most people come try to, when do they chore was Latin. The first time it was translated into gym, Germanic egg

Speaker 4:          01:19:42       was, I believe in the fourth century by a priest called will fill up. And when I look at the actual extension of where it is, a lot of people were really illiterate in the first place. And the way that they learn to read, I'm in Greece and in Rome was actually by reading the Bible and reading the actual scripture and saying, oh, it would be the way someone would read a kid's book these days only you're not reading a Kid's book. You're reading what you're going to be indoctrinated into for the rest of your entire life. In other words. That's the first book. In the last book you're gonna read, probably if you are sitting in there and you're a peasant in the middle of nowhere in the Middle Ages,

Speaker 1:          01:20:18       it says that Germanic language translations of the Bible have existed since the Middle Ages, and the most influential is Luther's translation and that the Martin Luther translations, I believe that was in the 15 hundreds or something like that. There's a great hardcore history podcast on that called the something Thor. Thor Thor's find it, find the name of that. I forget what it is, but it's all about Martin Luther translated the Bible into a phonetic language. Yeah, they couldn't read it. So back then when a priest was the only direct connection to God, he was the only guy that was able to tell you the word of God. He was, here it is angels. Here it is.

Speaker 4:          01:21:04       The gothic Bible or the will fill a bible. Christian Bible as translated by the ref will fill it in the fourth century into the gothic language spoken by the eastern Germanic peoples or the gothic tribes, meaning the inheritors of the Roman state as Rome fell in a four, 10. And then of course I think in four 55 and then finally,

Speaker 1:          01:21:27       um, what was the last four 76? And back then the Germans were totally different. Like the, the, the whole country of Germany. There was so many barbarians. There's big fucking powerful, scary. But this, this is, this is the interesting point. What makes them a barbarian that they weren't with Rome, if anything wasn't roam the most barbaric out of all of them? Well, I mean when I say barbarian, I mean like Conan the barbarian. We use a big giant to the fuckers who ate meat and drink milk. That was like primary staples of their dying and any massive amount of protein, but the protein content of their diet. It's why they were so big. They were enormous people. I don't think they did a whole lot of farming cause it's cold as shit up there. So they're there, they're eating, you know, a lot of animal protein. And they were, apparently, they were enormous in comparison to a lot of the people that would encounter them. Like that was like the first depictions from China, I believe, of encountering German people. They were like, Holy Shit, are these fucking people big? You know, they were just enormous savage people, you know? Well, I mean, I dunno.

Speaker 4:          01:22:32       I'm sure that there were some sort of human sacrifice here and there. Oh fuck. Yeah. The thing is that everybody did that. That shit was standard. When you look at their, their tribal societies though, I really would like to, to sit down and examine what the, the, the process was for them in, in their societies as opposed to when they were romanized, you know, because that, that people living in, in like some mud hut in the middle of Germany, I'm sure they had some different idea of controlling themselves and, and to, in

Speaker 1:          01:23:07       similar to the way native American people don't, didn't ever had a prison. You know what I mean? Where the fuck did you put the people that did bad things? Will, you just have to fix them or put them on sticks. Somebody had to be fixed the islands off. Someone had to be fixed. Yeah. Or Kill Them. I think they'd probably killed a lot of people too. Well, that's the thing. I mean, it depends on what he wants. Society, you want to imagine. I mean, I remember I watched the movie 300 right? And it was like, Oh man, they seem, they make these Persians seem like the wicked his people, but when you look at it, what were the Greeks still and they were practicing infanticide. It was still a monarchy. Sparta's still had slaves like a motherfucker. I give him the movie 300 a lot of creative freedom because it was based on a graphic novel and it's obviously got a lot of, they're doing uncle [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:23:51       I know I don't have I Lao goes through that movie. I loved it. But to me it's a comic book. Right? The real problem with making a movie about Spartans is you're going to have to have a bunch of dudes fucking each other. Okay. If you're gonna do it right, you want to do it right. You got to do a historically accurate, which is why when Martin, when he was like, oh dude, those Athenian boy lovers, and I was like, wait a minute dude, exam from Sparta dudes here in the gymnasium, which means like naked in Greek or something. It's off course. There was a lot of man fucking going on, but it was normal. I mean, I'm not saying that they should do it because it would, you know, somehow or another discredit them, but it is historical fact that the people that live back then engaged in much more homosexual activities. Then we think of today that particular area and that particular the Greeks and the Romans and the Spartans and all this fucking savages, they were banging each other. They always were and it was a part of life. It was a normal thing. And men having boys for lovers and like that was like, I mean how many philosophers had said, hey, that's not real. It's not spartan. That's your boyfriend. Fucking some veterans who come down and put some gay guy up. Don't do it again.

Speaker 1:          01:25:00       That's, it's not, not, it's not, you know, I mean, how is that what you're talking about murderers and, and, and warmongers you're talking about people that constantly engaged in the slaughter of people. Like why would it somehow or another discredit them if they had gay sex? Like who gives a shit? But it is the reality. The reality is like this, this picture of, it's a real depiction of a, a real gladiator in a real young boy. And cause that shit was like super calm. Some people thought in that particular age that the only true love that could exist was between a man and a young boy. That's unfortunately dow that society chose to. I mean, you know that in other words has been used in a lot of times I've seen to taint the uh, the arguments that are made for, for, for gay rights and people say, oh well now they're going to want children that had absolutely nothing to do with that.

Speaker 1:          01:25:47       That's a different complete era of time in which people didn't have adult hood defined the way we do now. And I think that's the problem that that engages, and I'm not being an apologist or excusing it, it's just that when, let's say this, the 1200 you know, you become an adult, not when you're 18 years old. You know, most people die when they were like 30 so if you're 18 you're damn near like the equivalent of like a being a middle aged man. But if you think about it during that particular very sparse, hey, that's not where he's supposed to put that. What hasn't we put down your rock real quick? This is called back mount. Obviously I'm, one of them is muscular and the other one is not. Oh Brokeback Greek closing on the guy on the bottom. Even back then they had tops and bottoms because it's like one dude who just clearly is the one who's going to get fucked every time. And the other dude is going to do all the fucking, so you look at the guy on the bottom, he's all smooth and shit. It doesn't look that he does is sit ups, doesn't do is squash the guy on top. It's very ripped. I think the guy in the bottle is kind of dough that's tired, easy. The guy in the bottom needs a lot of naps.

Speaker 1:          01:27:08       Yo. But you couldn't have a movie like that if you had a movie like that where you showed the true lives, the spark wasn't able to grow with it, right? Yeah. But did they have a lot of gay sex in that movie? No, not try Alexander. I mean I was gay because Collin Farrell was it. It was the, the lead him and whatever the other dude was in there. And so let me ask you something. In the MMA where like you have your balls and someone else's face and they're on the ground. Are you allowed to talk shit? Are you allowed to talk shit like that? Absolutely. Jake, when you're on the floor, if you want to fuck with the guy's head, you could definitely do that. As long as they do a lot of that shit. Oh yeah. There's some dudes, Nick Diaz talks mad shit during every one of his fights.

Speaker 1:          01:27:44       Everyone has his fights. You standing in front of people going, what? Bitch? What? Beck? Boom. And then it pops you. I'm fucking you up bitch. Like he'll talk shit to you while he's, no, I don't mean that white frat boy swag shit that they put before. I just mean like Mexican first one. But I'm just saying, I know I picked that up on it. He has came out. I'm just saying, you know, that's just what I hear. Oh, what's up bitch? Screw this right now. Like, Oh, you know that men of costing in. That's the way I see all the time with schools. When I, when I used to wipe out my, my thing is this though, this is like an officer. We're talking about an MMA fight we're talking about. Right. But I mean in terms of, in terms of the sexual portion, I'm sure guys do.

Speaker 1:          01:28:24       I'm sure guys, fuck with guys. Look, if someone's gonna fuck with you and try to get inside your head, they're going to try to do it by any means necessary. There's no limit on that. It like for example, other sports, they have a limit to what they can say and then they're like, oh no, this is like too, didn't they get in trouble on some shit in the NBA when they were talking about somebody else's wife or you're only allowed to say certain things. You're talking about somebody else's kids ear. Like for example, in certain soccer leagues, you're not allowed to mention somebody who's family or talk about racism like when you were in a scrum. I know the football players are notorious for that. Saying the darkest, most evil shit to someone on another team. I'm going to rape your babies. I'm like, dude, you got to be a beautiful kid. I'm going to fuck his face right after I pound you into the ground. Like dudes is without a doubt said Shit like that. It's psychological war man.

Speaker 2:          01:29:13       He does know cool, but there's no, but similar to some of the way some sports regulated. Should it be regulated, Joe? No, no. It's free speech. Anything that you say it took your house is on fire right now. Well, that's different. First of all, you're saying in the middle of a fight, you can't. Yeah. You should be able to say, your house is on fire. How the fuck would you mom? No, my house. Right. Or, you know what could your dick out of my face? Stop Talking Shit about my house. What is this? Why don't you pull it down so we could read it? I said, this is a New York Knicks. Camilio Anthony Carmelo is strange from wife l law of whatever. What is it about, what is it about putting this up? He pretty much said a comment like when he was playing, I, your wife tastes like honey nut cheerios and then getting in trouble for that. You know, it's funny. Melo was, let's be honest, pretty mellow was waiting for him apparently. Um, like uh, where they go to the walk to the bus, like right there. He was supposedly waiting for him. Oh look, he's going to kick his ass. I mean, again, they were both on the same team together as different teams, different things. Well, you know, that's a choice he's going to have to make on his own.

Speaker 2:          01:30:25       Yeah. Listen, I need that chair. It's interesting to talk shit. It's part of it look

Speaker 1:          01:30:34       like that. You're clearly an asshole. You clearly a piece of shit as a human being and if you willing to be a piece of shit as a human being just for, you know, just to win, you can win without that. You went without that and be healthier. You know, especially fighting, you know the odds of you really getting inside a dude's head and causing them to do somethings, going to make them lose the fight. They're fucking professionals, man. Those are the dudes who are really good. Stop Brian. Stop putting shit up. Distracting. But isn't it the dudes that are winning, man, there's, there's fucking Samurais. They know what the fuck they're doing it. But wouldn't the professionals know what

Speaker 2:          01:31:05       to say to get into someone's head? No, no, no, no, no, no. Isn't that a part of warfare? No, it's a lot of guys are not good at all. Like mystery writers ever. Misdirection distraction. Yeah, of course. You have the silent warrior now you're, yeah. You're the one who's romanticizing. No, no, no. Here. Who will just sit there praying and some Buddhist temple until he gets up like Ken and Raju and goes and beats the shit out of his opponent and then fly back to Thailand so they can send them to that, that fake statue and fights the got later. No, I mean dude, he's going to say some fucked up shit in your ear.

Speaker 1:          01:31:33       No, you're wrong. This is why you're wrong. Okay. The greatest fighters almost always are martial artists, like real martial artists. The guys like George Saint Pierre and the guy's like Leo Machida, these guys, they're not shit talkers ever at all. They followed by the true martial arts principles and it's one of the reasons why they're so good. They don't carry the burden of Shit. Talking what a guy like Chael Sonnen talking mad shit before a fight. Look, Shayle Kann obviously back it up. He's obviously a very good fighter, but make no mistake about it. There's a tremendous on him because of that shit talking on top of the fact that he's got to fight. That is an extra opponent that you have inside the octagon, knowing that if you lose my God, you're going to look like a fucking idiot. That shit is real and it's an enemy. And it is also enforcing the ego, which is, it has to be left out as much as possible in any situation where you're dealing with extreme pressure because it shows character, cracks, cracks.

Speaker 1:          01:32:25       But then what about, what about a guy like Muhammad Ali? Muhammad Ali was a brilliant, a brilliant boxer, and he was a brilliant sportsman and he figured out how to get inside a lot of people's heads and defeat them, but he would have been able to do that just by boxing them. Look, it was beautiful what he did because it was entertaining for all of us. And by doing that, he also called a tremendous amount of attention to himself. But you know what I think he did was a form of extreme. The extreme braggadocious nature of the way he would talk was so obvious that it was almost like theater. Like Howard Cosell said to him, champions seem truculent. He goes, whatever. Does it mean if it's good, I'm that like just that somebody in somebody's ear saying whatever you want to say to him. You know, and if you want you s you see him doing that at that particular time.

Speaker 1:          01:33:12       Sure is. People wouldn't think he's wrong for that, but someone would think that someone who's talking shit on a football field saying reckless things about someone else's family, they're row. Oh well wait, first of all, people definitely thought he was wrong for that. I'm not saying, do you think he's wrong for that? No, I don't think anybody's wrong for anything. I told you I think you should be able to talk mad shit on the football. But you said that people who do that are a Douche bag cause he comes back. Oh yeah. He was definitely a Douche bag of Joe Frazier. He was 100% of Douche bag of Joe Frazier. He used to bring a gorilla, a rubber gorilla during the time of the fifties and sixties rather, w where you're, you're dealing with this. When they grew up, Ali and Frazier grew up during the worst racial time in all of history and Muhammad Ali in this, the history of this country, 60 was probably worse than that.

Speaker 1:          01:33:58       It's pretty bad. But I mean, as far as like the turn of the times, they're dealing with Martin Luther King, The d, The all the race riots. And then you're also dealing with a new medium, which is television, and you're dealing with this face that is not only is this guy a, an incredibly controversial figure, but this guy was also a black African American who doesn't want to fight in Vietnam War, and he's holding up a gorilla and he's calling Joe Frazier, an uncle Tom, and he's hitting this gorilla doll saying that he's a big ugly gorilla. Joe Frazier, and he's setting Joe Frazier up to be like this, this, this uncle Tom with the white man champion. That doesn't question anything. Well, he's, I mean, he savaged that guy's reputation to destroyed that guy's mind. He hate Joe Frazier hated him forever and they could have just fought. They could have just fought, you know, they could have just did.

Speaker 1:          01:34:53       He could've, he could've left all that racist shit out of there. It could have left all that uncle Tom Shit. Either he chose to do that. Was he a douchebag? Look, man, I'm just an observer watching a guy live his life. But he was definitely a Douche bag of Joe Frazier and Joe Frazier was pretty open about it. He hated that motherfucker for a long time because of that shit used to make fun of him even when he had like Parkinson's and all the other shit about that. Oh yeah, yeah. Joe Frazier, he taunted Muhammad Ali's shaking and all that stuff. I mean he, he was, he was upset for a long ass fucking time and he, when he knocked Muhammad Ali Down with that left Hook and won that fight, that first fight, make no mistake about, a lot of people were fucking happy than Muhammad Ali. The draft dodging black man who talks all that shit got beat and lost his title to the guy who's like a good family man who, who, you know goes to church allegedly a, he's a fighter.

Speaker 1:          01:35:36       He's a fucking who, they're all crazy, every, every fight. It's crazy. You know, you're fucking throwing bones at a man for a living, you know, it's a nutty way to get by. But he was the preferable one cause he was much more humble and wasn't this guy, you know, well shook up the world. He wasn't that guy. He was, he was a different guy. It was just a tough guy from the streets of Philadelphia. So it totally different situation. But people definitely hated, I'll leave because of his talking shit. They always hate guys who are confident. There's always going to be people that want a chip you down when you have that con gone. Flint is Anderson Silva coming back. Who knows man, or it's a hard injury to come back from you. Tell me, is he going well, I don't know. Any prediction you, you know, I wouldn't have no idea.

Speaker 1:          01:36:15       First of all, I'm not a doctor. Second of all, I don't know what's going on in his head. You know, you get the psychology of a guy who loses twice in devastating fashion like that once by catastrophic injury in a fight. The weeds, quite honestly, losing your boss the first round and a pretty, he was losing that fight in a big way that first round and that guy was gaining on him. That guy's scary guy, that Chris Weidman, he's just, he's a fucking beast and he beat Anderson twice. I saw some videos of him fighting other people. He's a monster. He's a monster. He's, he's a really tough wrestler who grew up getting his ass kicked by his brothers. Those are the most dangerous motherfuckers. Those the youngest kids have a family full of savages. Dad was like a pro football player, all stud athletes, house full of Stud athlete Dudes, you have to be tough as fuck to be the young brother.

Speaker 1:          01:37:02       But they probably broke a bone of his or her to grow around the metal plate on his head. He was relaying all the different times he was bullied by his brothers and what happened they, they created a guy who gives zero fucks and we'll punch your face in. I mean that's what it is. And Anderson Silva just couldn't hang with that two times in a row. We call over showboating and all that stuff aside was showboating the first time and during the first fight and it was, but one of the reasons why your show buttons cause he was getting smashed when he took him down. He wanted Weidman to keep that fight standing where he has the best advantage cause he took Weidman, took Anderson to the ground early in the first round and hit him with some vicious ground and past stung him, roll his eyes back in his head.

Speaker 1:          01:37:39       He hit him with a couple hard shots. One very clean right hand that without a doubt Anderson saw some sparks without a doubt, and he knew that that was a real dangerous position. He couldn't hold this guy back for very long. Holding onto him on the ground is tough. He's too strong, it's too good of a, and he hits too hard. So his best chance was to get this guy to stand up with him. So he started getting cocky with them, talking shit, trying to get into his head and that's, that's what it actually cost him would cost him was him not fighting like a martial artist was him being like a guy trying to play psychological warfare instead of just fighting with perfect technique. He got the guy to stand up with him. If he can keep that fight standing, he should have the advantage.

Speaker 1:          01:38:18       He's much faster. His technique is about as good as it gets in all the land. There's no better stand up striking techniques in Anderson Silva's, but in, in goading, that guy into an ego battle, he took some chances and then you got cracked. So I don't know if he's coming back, man. Those are two big losses, you know, I mean, he says he's not in, he's towards the end of his career, not towards the beginning allegedly. Right. You know, some guys can stretch that shit out. What's crazy is guys like Bernard Hopkins who are 10 years older than him and Bernard Hopkins has one of the light heavyweight titles in boxing. He's the 175 pound champion and he's almost 50 years old. I mean, no one's ever done that before, but Bernard Hopkins fights exactly the opposite of Anderson. He's very safety technique oriented. If you watch how Bernard fights, he's a master.

Speaker 1:          01:39:05       I license a master with his footwork. He's a master of positioning. He's always in a good place. You're always in a bad place. He's just been around for so long and he knows how to get guys out of their head, but the way he gets guys out of their head is he's, he fights rough with them. He gets dirty with them. He pulls on their heads a lot. He leans on them. He, he fights rough. If it's real rough and hill, he'll force a boxer to get into his clinch wars with him. Almost like an MMA fight where he wears the guy's arms out, makes them too tired of punch and then you know, I mean he did that to a lot of dudes. He did that to Felix Trinidad. He Fuck Felix Trinidad. I remember that fight. A lot of people didn't see him winning.

Speaker 5:          01:39:41       Who's an unstuck flag and all that. You know they had a green light on him in New York back in the day. Yo Man, Puerto Ricans were like, Yo, the green light on that again, they were, they were literally going to put like a spirit. That was hard when he came up here. He, he squashed all that apparently. I don't know how, but I just let it know. Once upon a time it was very real. And then when back in the nineties if you had beef with a Puerto Rican, you had beef with a million of them. They were not. It was the 2010 he fuck Tito Trinidad. I don't remember the exact year, but no, it was like two it was like literally 2000 all right. Was it leaking into that? Remember the Jerry Seinfeld thing? He had beef with the Puerto Rican. What was that only Seinfeld Dude? Yeah. What was it over? It was, it was over the PR parade. Like th they, they had like an episode where they like, you didn't make it in front of the parade or level. They then people were calling it racist and all this other stuff. But yeah, it's side. He had to squash the beef with the Puerto Rican dude

Speaker 1:          01:40:36       right after September 11th it was actually September 29th, 2001 the Madison Square Garden. Crazy. Yeah. He stepped on the flight. He apologized afterwards. He said they actually had to move it because it was supposed to be September 15th and that was right after September 11th so there was a Madison Square Garden. Yup. And so they moved it to September 29th wow. That's crazy. And he beat the shit out of Felix Trinidad. That was, I remember that fight boxing performance masterful. No, I remember that fight. It was genius. And then he fought Kelly Pavlick and that was another genius performance. I mean, that was another fight where was a dangerous fight against a real knockout puncher and just puck circles around that kid. He's just so technical, man. So who's gonna, who's gonna fight the Wiedemann Dude now? Well is gonna Fight Vitor Belfort. Yeah. Yeah. That's an interesting fight. Well, it's also interesting because there's a real controversy regarding testosterone use because Vito has a testosterone use exemption and he's been fighting in Brazil, apparently has low testosterone.

Speaker 1:          01:41:34       So they give them the license to take testosterone like all the time. So he's essentially taking hormones, taking male hormones, and Weidman is not, so Weidman is fighting completely naturally with no enhancement whatsoever. Just being a young guy with normal [inaudible] see limits and all, all kinds of, maybe, I don't know what it uses. Some guys don't use shit. There's some guys that fight in the UFC that don't use a god damn thing. They just eat healthy food and drink a lot of water. And that's it. There's quite a few guys who do that. Right. Um, some guys take a variety of different muscle enhancing supplements. You know, there's like testosterone boosters that are legal. Like there's a one that on its cells called t plus shown, the people like weightlifters were showing that it's a increased their ability to lift weights in double blind placebo studies where you're not using, you know, using essentially a giant group of people.

Speaker 1:          01:42:23       They don't know what they're using and the people that were using t plus got higher, uh, higher improvement in their, their weightlifting. So there's a few things that you can do, but for the most part, most of the guys that get on it, they get on the synthetic form, they get an a on a synthetic form of testosterone. So this is like a few different t plus and there's a couple, there's a couple of other test boosters and there's a few routes that are supposed to work. Like tribulus is supposed to have us a small effect. Then there's some, there's another, what does it, Long Jack cat or something like that. I forget. There's another one that's supposed to have some sort of an effect. But for the most part, it doesn't have any where near the effect that actually taking testosterone will have. So there's guys take it and Vitor is taking it and they're, they uh, there's a dispute as to whether or not he's going to get licensed in Las Vegas.

Speaker 1:          01:43:11       And if he doesn't get licensed to use testosterone, then he has to get off of the testosterone and then fight Wyman. And if that happens, man, that's going to be really fascinating because his hormone levels are going to be all fucked up. If he's used to taking a, an, an extra natural form of testosterone, injecting it into a system and then you stopped doing it, his body's going to have a much lower level of testosterone in his training camps. Then even normally a regular human being, but he would have a much lower will drop off. Yeah. Because his body's been used to getting it externally. His body's not producing it anymore. So it's really interesting. You don't have to, they'll have to kickstart his body's production of testosterone, which is like, wow, that's crazy. So it's, it's, it's controversial in that respect. But skill wise it's a very dangerous fight for both guys. Weidman is a fucking beast, but God Damn Vito Belfort looks scary as shit. Lately. He took out Dan Henderson in the first round, he took out, you mean he took him out in a way that no one's ever taken Dan Henderson out like that is his striking is horrific. It's very,

Speaker 4:          01:44:12       actually I went to, uh, like a mixed martial arts competition, but like it was like a local one that one of my friends was supposed to fight in. Um, but he got injured and so he didn't find at the end, but I ended up watching it and it was actually pretty interesting. It was in a, it was like in Long Island. Um, and it was like a small gym. It was full of like a few hundred people. But it was really interesting. Like I saw the difference in kind of how they run those local spots and now I've never actually been to one of those big MMA things.

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       Tell me when you want to go, man, I'll hook it up. Tell me when you want to go. You heard it. You heard it here. You just give me a day. Good. Just tell me which one you want to go, then we'll hook it up. No, I definitely want to see it on February 22nd holy Shit. That's my birthday weekend, Vegas. There it is. Oh, you're planning on doing this. This is what he's feeling. That's the feeling you get when you're anticipating a hangover. That's what you just did. Do you, what's the one after that just in case? Well, there's a big one in Dallas after that. A huge one that's for the welterweight title and it's a Dallas Cowboy stadium, so that's, that's a gigantic event. That one, if you want that one, uh, I'll give you the exact date of that. That is, that's in March.

Speaker 1:          01:45:29       I think it's march. I want to say 15th but hold on a second. I'll tell you in one second. Yeah. Is it March 15th yeah. Yeah. That one is going to be gigantic. That is 50,000 people, man in, in Dallas at Dallas Cowboy stadium. That's probably the best one to go to cause that's going to be historic. And the title fight. Yeah, there'll be a new new crowning of the welterweight championship because, uh, George stepped down. George Saint Pierre stepped down. And so the guy who am, I thought one the decision, Johny Hendricks. I thought it was a bad decision. And I'm a huge George Saint Pierre Fan, by the way of him as a person and as a fighter. But I thought it with all honesty, that the decision was incorrect. I thought Johnny went through rounds to two. So he's going to take on Robbie Lawler. So that'll be the new UFC welterweight champion.

Speaker 1:          01:46:10       Dude, you got to come to that. So he vacated the title and now they're gonna they're gonna brawl out. Yes. And there's also Carlos condit was fighting Tyron Woodley, which is fucking madness and chaos. That's going to be an insane fight. That's an insane, insane fight. There's a lot of insane fights. Diego Sanchez fight and miles jury. That is a great fucking fight. Miles jury is a beast. Real tough young kid. And Diego Sanchez is this definition of the word savage. This Cuban motherfucker, Hector Lombard. You ever seen him fight a whole shit? Is He scary? I heard of him. God dammit. He's a monster. He's a monster dude. A an Olympic judoka judo specialist who, who doesn't even use his grappling just knocks people to fuck out. He's a super athlete and um, yeah, he just fought Nate Marquardt and put them away in the first round in the a mugging and Nate, Mark Schwartz, the former Strikeforce champion and lumbar just mugged him at one 70.

Speaker 1:          01:47:07       He's terrifying. He thought his whole career, one 85 is the Bella to champion at 185 pounds, but dropped down to one 70. And he's just like a muscle. I mean the dude is like 6% body fat and just shredded, shredded spring of just courted steel. And he says, everybody's has tried to get the fuck away from him. Just throwing bombs at you. The, the move did a Wiedemann made vitamins, Weidman part to, to uh, the weed man. That's when we'll call it. You don't weed man homie. I'm not going to say that he's heard this. I'm sure he's heard it a million times. You know, people called me that before I break their fucking legs, homie. He wouldn't say that. He's a super nice guy now. He probably is. Most things that I know that really, really got it like that. They don't have a star problems.

Speaker 1:          01:47:51       They just wait to the problems come to them and they take care of him and they keep it moving. Well the guy he's fighting a super nice guy too. Carlos condit is fighting this guy. Jake shields is a Jujitsu black belt, so world class grappler. So it's a real, real interesting guy. Just beat Woodley in his last fight. So it's a very interesting, very interesting fight. And what about this, uh, who's going to fight a Jon and Jon Jones? Jon Jones is going to fight. He's gonna fight in Baltimore and he's gonna fight Glover to sharer. Who's the scariest motherfucker? All the 205 pound contenders. Glover is the fucking devil. He's scary. He's, everybody knows that Glover was on the sidelines for six months. He had a visa issue and he couldn't get to the United States and he was fucking people up in small shows cause he was one to chuck Adele's training partners and he has been world class like top of the food chain worldclass for almost a decade now like Soca Jew before.

Speaker 1:          01:48:43       So could you make this big splash and pride was knocking, knocked out, little nog knocked out Ricardo Arona before he did that glow over to sheriff fucked him up in the WEC. But Glover had visa issues. So for six years everybody knew that Glover was like having real problems trying to fight in America but he's fighting in Brazil and just beaten the fucking shit out of people. Man. He's a beast. What was the visa issue? He was resilient and sometimes you know, you have an issue getting a um, the, the visa to fight American money. He didn't have the money, he wasn't fighting for the UFC back then. He was fighting for a smaller organizations and you know, you got to have a visa before the UFC can even sign you. It's funny because we were going to have a discussion later on today. Um, Dan and like chunking, we wouldn't have a talk about immigration and we were discussing this specific issue about, um, they were saying, oh, you know, it's the law. The, all the critics are saying, oh, it's the, the law has to be enforced. It's not just the law, it's the law for poor people. Because when you're rich, apparently some of my friends who are lawyers that handle immigration cases, they'll tell me straight

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       up, no, listen, there are rich families from places in Asia and the Middle East that when they want to come here, they buy a green card. And I was like, what do you mean by a green card and lower, it wasn't rich. They set up a company in order to, to employ certain people here it has to be a certain way. It's like 200, $300,000. And when they pay into it, they immediately are given green cards to manage the business here as long as they employ a certain amount of Americans. But like you say, you know, he probably just didn't have the people backing him up. Yeah, you got to have mad cash to buy or you make a fake company in order to get green cards, but it can be done. We had $1,000. Look, if you are really wealthy man from Iceland and you wanted to come to America and get a green card, I'm sure it could be arranged. And someone, you know, guys got a billion Coonara in front of your money is, you know, whatever their money is over there. But my friend Glover,

Speaker 1:          01:50:38       this a guy who is going to be fighting Jon Jones who also, uh, um, I, I'm actually friends with John Jones. I love that guy. That's a tough fight. Tough fight for both guys. Glow Glover is a beast, but Jon Jones is a God damn freak athlete. He's a freak and I think Jon Jones is going to be old. Tra motivated for this fight. I felt like he, he learned something. His last title defense was a tough fight against Gustafson who's a beast. It was a great, great fight. Really, really close fight. John One that decision and I think, you know, really realize he was in a war and his bearing down, he's saying all the right things and I think he's going to try to look to put on a show against this clover cat. But Glover is scary as fuck, man. What are they going to fight? They're going to find in Baltimore in April.

Speaker 1:          01:51:20       Glow over puts people to sleep, man. He puts people to sleep with one punch. He fought Ryan Bader and Ryan Bader heard him, Ryan Bader tagged him and wobbled him. And as Ryan Bader moved into closest show, Glover to share shut his fucking lights off. He's a monster man. He's been around a long ass time and he hits fucking hard. We had his trainer, John Hackleman was on the podcast and he was talking about holding the myths for this dude. And he's like, he hits you different. He's like, Hackleman by the way, was a kickboxing champion. Motherfuckers been around since the 70s doing karate and Campo and he's, he's seen it all. And then some, and he talks about Glover's like in this fucking guy hits you. You're like, you feel the knuckles through your hand, like you're holding the pads for him. He's like, I've never felt it like that. He goes, I've never had anybody punched me that hard. He goes, not chocked, not anybody. And he goes, chuck is up murderous puncher. This guy punches even harder. He's like, it's like ridiculous. Like Mike Tyson style, punching power. He's like, he, if he hits you, you're fucked. And he did that to Ryan Bader. Ryan Bader tagged him. I don't wobbled and covering up. And Ryan Bader moved in for the kill and clover just [inaudible] just dropped a haymaker on and he see his eyes go sideways and his legs give out

Speaker 4:          01:52:35       motherfucking. It's hard. Recently, I forget who it was, but one person was really wearing down in his mouth, fuck his leg. He was just working on the leg, beating the shit out of his leg and then does

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       hit him with the overhand right. She knocked dude out. Mike. Well this has been a few of those, you know, it was at a kickboxing match or was it a MMA fight? It was an MMA fight. Was it the UFC? I believe so. It might've been a Edson Barboza. Edson Barboza is one of the most scary guys when it comes to a leg kicks in the UFC. He's one of the, uh, the top lightweights. He's actually fighting Donald Serone that's coming up soon. Caught. Damn. That's kind of be a good buck. I guess it's the American Airlines Center jail there a lot of good. Okay. Is there a lot of gambling at these events? Oh yeah. In Vegas on 100%. The one, if you want to come to the, uh, Vito Belfort, Chris Weidman fight, that's in May, that's May 24th. If you want to come to that, that's going to be in Vegas.

Speaker 1:          01:53:28       And I just hope they see if they don't give Vitara testosterone use exemption. I mean, I understand what everybody says. It's not fair. I understand the logic, but if they don't give it to him, he really shouldn't be fighting for the title unless he can get his hormones back in order. I, if it's been taking testosterone for a long period of time, I don't understand how his body's just going to start magically producing it again on its own unless they figure out something that they could give him that will kickstart is production of testosterone. But if that's the case, shouldn't have been doing that in the first place. So I don't know. I mean, if the guy really does need testosterone, I hope they give it to them because if they don't, he's not going to really be able to fight. Right. Not to the same level that he's going to be able to fight if he's on it.

Speaker 1:          01:54:10       Honestly. But wasn't my Tyson taking like pills or mood on him pills when he fought Lennox Lewis away, he told me this story. They said things on antidepressants. He was taking some sort of medication. Yeah, that's happened before. Um, guys kiss on his cheek and all. He's trying to be nice to him. He said, I love you. He said, I love Edm Ma. You know, not to make fun of Mike Tyson. You know, he's a monster even now. But I'm just saying when I look at that, I'm like, all right, how could he not have been affected by that? And you are mood altering drugs and now they're asking you to fight for your life. And then at the end of it you put a flower and then it goes hair and then kissed him on the cheek. Yeah. I don't know what he was on when he fought Lennox, but I wouldn't be surprised man.

Speaker 1:          01:54:52       He was high on drugs during major fights. He definitely said that, that he was a, he was doing coke all the time and uh, he even used a, a, a fake penis to a avoid detection. He, one of those fake rubber penis. He's a bad motherfucker, dude. I love the fact that he comes out and just tell us everything about everything that he did. That was crazy. It makes me more inclined to believe that he never raped that girl first of all. And it makes me more inclined to sort of forgive him for being so fucking crazy. The, all the horrible things that he definitely did do. It's like the guy was living in a wild, reckless life. He's telling you all he did. He's telling me he's opening up the door like this is all the Shit I did. I was doing coke and fighting people and people are like, oh, here's the rubber Dick.

Speaker 1:          01:55:35       Like to him, Jesus Christ, I think he's, he's a classic story in my opinion, is the greatest heavyweight champion of all. I think so, yes. I put them at the top of the list. I think for a brief moment in time, people want to consider his whole entire career towards the end out of prison after prison post-prison but I think that before then, I think when he was in his prime, the guy that beat Larry Holmes, I think the guy that beat Marvis Frasier, I think that that Mike Tyson brand heavyweight, but he also had small paper champion dudes that he fought and a bunch of them obviously not the ones you mentioned, and then the razor Ruddick fight was crazy. Those people really gave him a run for his money. He, he had to punish them as much as they were trying to punish him. But for some of them, for example, the bus, the dug this thing, he took that shit lightly.

Speaker 1:          01:56:24       He walked in like it was whatever. And it went over with some other fighters, but not with buster Douglas. Well that was also post-prison. He wasn't the same guy, right? Wasn't it? No, no, no, no, no. I'm wrong. No, buster Douglas happened before and all the crazy shit happened. Then he went to prison. Right. And they lost his title in the, and then he came back and then he came back and he fought Holyfield and have those Holyfield Dubach holes. Those were fucking crazy. When we bid Holyfield's ear, that was all post-prison. You're right. When he was getting, he was saying that Holyfield was headbutting him. Yeah, he does all the time. Go back and you look at all the tapes. No headbutts everybody. But Tyson did it too. I mean they had buttered each other and the point being that Tyson like didn't stay at the same level when custom auto died.

Speaker 1:          01:57:06       And then Kevin Rooney took over. I think he maintained that level for a little bit, but I think that the fame and the fortune and the madness, we're too crazy when you have your own fucking lions, when you, you live in in a gigantic hundred fucking room house and bought 15 Bentley's, you know, for every person you've ever met is, he's a, he's a mad man. You got a bunch of factory loading as people. But I mean again, but I just think, I don't think you can keep it up, but I think that when he was at his best, I think he only kept it up for a few years, like two years, three years. But I think during that time he was the greatest of all time. That's my personal opinion. I don't think anybody ever sent shockwaves through the boxing world the way that guy did when he emerged on the scene and just started starching people with fucking haymakers that came at the speed that Roberto Duran would throw them.

Speaker 1:          01:57:57       Yet it's coming from a guy who's 215 pounds and just launching motherfuckers into orbit. That right hook to the body. White upper. Cut that with snap your fucking head back that up because when I see the, the, the, the old youtube videos of him fighting upper cut his, the way he merged, I don't know how someone's jaw was intact after that. He was for Russias but you can't keep it up forever man. It's red lining. When you red line and engine you'd go back, you'd get that bitch up to 9,000 rpm and then you kind of shift gears. You have to, and he didn't ever shift gears. Somebody red line to to this, somebody told me we were having this discussion about like music and I went to the Berkeley College of music and I was telling kids like, listen, people don't generally get rich off of music, which what artists do is they take that nest egg of money that they do or that they get from music and they invested wisely and something else.

Speaker 1:          01:58:50       The richest rappers, quote unquote, are people who have made some money in music and they say, Oh, you know what? I'm going to start like a construction company or our contracting company or I'm going to buy six waffle houses or I'm going to get, you know, a clothing company or whatever it is and that's how they make that money. What, what is the twilight for fighters, Joe? Where do they fall back on? The pen is on a fighter. It depends entirely on the restaurant. Some guys become commentators like chill son and he'll eventually be a commentator for sure. He is one now. Rashad Evans is doing commentary now while he's fighting. Brian Stan retired. He became a commentator. Kenny Florian retired. He became a commentator. A lot of them are there and they're also becoming judges. Ricardo Alomeda as a judge in New York now and he's also, a lot of them are coaches.

Speaker 1:          01:59:34       That's most likely the best path for them, especially the guys that still love the sport. They still want to be around the sport. Like Duane Ludwig is the coach of the year. He won coach of the year. Congratulations. My friend Dwayne, he won coach of the year for 2013 rightly so, because he did a tremendous job of transitioning between being a great fighter to being an even better coach. I mean an amazing coach for this team. Alpha male. He's just changed that whole fucking team. I mean they, they're all striking like at a very high level now. Much, much higher than they were before. So that's a good transition for Dwayne and he's doing very well with that. But some guys, uh, they just quit and go into business. Keith Jardine open up a coffee company. He's a caveman coffee. That's Keith. And uh, my friend Tate, who also was former MMA fighter, they open up a coffee company.

Speaker 1:          02:00:18       Some guys go into acting, you know Gina Gershon is like a famous actress now. Gina Gershon. Gina Damn. What's her name? Gina Carano. Gina Gershon is obviously a famous actress too. Um, there was another rumor that Clinton fucked her too. That's why it was, I'd fallen all this. Jesus went and fucked everybody. Love Him. Last American presidential, Dick's Linger, ladies and gentlemen, Dude, what was he? They say he smashed out Liz Hurley. Yeah. Yeah. This is a picture of them stare at each other, looking at each other's eyes and you're like, oh yeah, for sure. It's just too romantic. The look I'm looking at, but it wasn't at times. Tom Sizemore. That was dry snitching. He was, yes. He was a dry snitch up that dirty son of a bitch. That Nigga was a snitch. He is. That's what I said. That's the first thing I said on the Fred. I said, but this tells me Tom Sizemore can't keep a fucking secret dude. Yeah, that's weak. And you go on throw bill under the bus. There's the picture. Come on son. Look at his eyes. No one escapes that deck. That deck octopus comes out and grabs. I mean, that is like a dominant submissive picture. If ever people were not touching, but one was encroaching Ludas body language. He's leaning towards her. Look at her. Look at her left shoulder. Turns slightly away from him. She wants to lay down right now. Look at her list. Dirty too dirty, dirty, dirty people. I love it. I wish I was there. I beat off in the corner. I wouldn't say a word

Speaker 2:          02:01:54       slick willy tearing it up.

Speaker 1:          02:01:58       I don't know how we got on that subject. We were talking about Mike Tyson beat the fuck out of people.

Speaker 2:          02:02:07       Tremendous. You'll need to fuck up the picture of we're putting Hillary and get that picture down.

Speaker 1:          02:02:12       You don't need to fuck up all of our minds, but thinking about the guilt that he must have suffered right after it

Speaker 2:          02:02:18       not worth it. Shit. Oh Kiss. And she knows. She knows right bag and the one in the back was like, Yo, look at her. Fuck. Oh my God. Look at that woman. Oh Wow. Yeah. Not they play dress up. Look Paul Revere's right behind them to his right. Look at that as Paul Revere. That woman. That woman's a hater. No, the woman right there. You get up to her. Look at that. She knows. She knows. That is the classic. She's either face the Dick. I did it. She definitely, she definitely knows that something's going on under the table

Speaker 1:          02:03:00       car. Her and her husband, she was like that motherfucker. Did you see the way he kissed Elizabeth early? Oh, he's such a pig. I, I despise him rush. Limbaugh's right. Look at him. Disgusting. You know what's funny though, when I heard about this, it was so interesting that I heard conservatives come out the woodwork. Um, who was it? I think it was rand Paul was like, Oh man, this is terrible. The president should apologize, but wait a minute homie. Where were you when Newt Gingrich was running for office? Because didn't he drop his wife and then deal with another woman and then deal with another one and mean, isn't that the, that the benchmark of men that are in power, they're just looking to play. Gotcha. All these shit heads. Are they just using that like it's points on a blanket. Nobody ever fuck no, they scored on you. They caught you, they scored on you. They got points now and they just going to use those points to try to shut you down and build them up. But it all just makes everybody look like a bunch of bitches. Because if that was going on amongst your friends, let's say if there was 10 of your friends and one of your friends was not particularly happy with his wife's relationship, and so he started banging Elizabeth Hurley and all. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:04:04       guys found out about it. I wouldn't dry snitch. I wouldn't play Tom Sizemore. I'll tell you, you went out and you, you snitch, you have no one would want to hang out with you anymore. Right. He'd be like, what the fuck tech, but oh man, who's going to party with Tom Sizemore now? Not me. I'll tell you that Tom. Go Fuck yourself pal secret.

Speaker 1:          02:04:23       Keep that motherfucker. I met Tom Sizemore. He's a cool dude. That's why I was, I was shocked. I did a show called the list. He came on and it was like a thing for VH one. It was pretty cool. Man, I think was him and a Rob Halford from Judas priest. We're on the same show.

Speaker 4:          02:04:40       Did he, did he know or was he secretly being recorded?

Speaker 1:          02:04:44       Oh, I don't know man. I don't know. I, I, you know, I don't know if he even really said it. I'm just talking shit. Like I said, I met the guy. He's a nice guy. Oh, so let's set it in some interview or something like that. Allegedly. That's what everyone's saying and there's a picture of him. Look man, the dude also did a lot of drugs. He probably is not thinking so good like his, uh, his judgments, quite suspect. He's not the kind of guy you would want to have some information if Tom Sizemore fines up dead. Vince foster style on a hill.

Speaker 4:          02:05:11       No, no blood at the scene of the crime. Super ugly.

Speaker 1:          02:05:14       Yeah. Vince, for the strange death of Vince foster is a fantastic book. You want to talk about a weird death that appears to be murder. This was during the Clinton administration. There's a guy named Vince foster and he knew some things about some things and a bunch of people knew some things and Vince foster might've been a, a liability and a, he wound up dead holding onto the gun in his hand with the thumb still on the trigger, which they say never happens. They say that when someone shoots themselves and you commit suicide, you're hand goes, the gun just goes flying. Like you don't hold onto the gun violence of a gun. It give you've ever shot at gotten, you know the guns have a kick. Well, if you're not conscious, you're not going to hold onto that gun and see where Vince foster has.

Speaker 1:          02:05:56       It's his thumb, like trapped in where holding on to the, to the gun. He's also lying down in an area where there was no blood. There's more blood missing from his body then was at the scene of the crime. His body was moved. Somebody moved him there. It doesn't mean that he didn't kill himself. He's each still could have killed himself. He could have killed himself with a gay lover and the gay lover wanting to cover up the story. So he grabbed the body and dropped it off somewhere and put the gun in his Thomas. Who knows? And I'm just making that gay little part up. I Dunno why I went there.

Speaker 4:          02:06:26       That's what I did get two of those images that Brian read bringing up with the fucking Greek shit. Whatever the reason was that whoever killed him, whoever

Speaker 1:          02:06:35       killed him, it was, it's most likely that, uh, whether it was he killed himself or somebody else killed him, they moved his body and a, they put a gun in his Tom, it just doesn't add up. It doesn't add up. It's a, it's a strange case because, uh, that's when the Whitewater shit was going on, right.

Speaker 4:          02:06:51       Water. What was the, what was the, the land deal that the Clintons were involved with? Water. They lost money on the deal. Supposedly it wasn't white water. The Nixon Shit. No, no, no, no. What was the Watergate, Watergate. Nixon. All this water talk water is a problem with presence. You know, it was crazy. I tell you a personal story. When I was incarcerated, I was in Pennsylvania and I was processed through an area. Um, and there was this a district attorney named Ray Greek car. Um, he disappeared. And another people who are watching from Pennsylvania, they knew this story, um, shot the PA. And the crazy thing is that he literally, he was investigating the Sandusky thing.

Speaker 1:          02:07:31       Yeah. A lot of people don't know that. They found his fucking laptop without a, without a hard and

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       he disappeared going, gone. And the asa that tried my case was in disbarred after uh, like two, it was like maybe two or three a, a case is after me for tampering with evidence. It's supposedly there was some shootout and like he had removed shell casings from the scene of the fucking room.

Speaker 1:          02:07:55       How about that other judge in, in Pennsylvania that got accused of sending kids Jay Holmes, he was selling and selling them for money. He made $3 million over the course of fucking like fucking 10 years. The guys I had judge and he's making sure that kids go to jail for paper. Fuck for money. Oh God, that's crazy. There's not a whole small enough or dark enough to shove him and you know, you get a kill that guy, that guy, you should put them in a corner and some parent you give a parent that gun and he going to shoot that fucking guy in the head. And you feed them to pigs. That's it. So you don't let that guy rot away and live at jail. He chose to take children and put them in horrendous situations where you know they were sexually abused, you know, do you know they were physically tortured?

Speaker 1:          02:08:40       100% and they could have been let free and they could have enjoyed their lives. They could have got their shit together. They could have been musicians or comedians or athletes or whatever the fuck they could have been without that horrific life experience that they were forced to endure because of a corrupt shot. Shoot that motherfucker right in the head. Throw them in a box, let the rats eat them, throw them in the ground, let the worms digest his body. Fuck him. Fuck his tombstone, no coffin. Getting that whole stupid, make him dig his own fucking hall and then shoot them right in the Dick. Shit. Fuck him. The crazy shit is though that

Speaker 5:          02:09:14       a lot of people never made that connection between his disappearance and it was only something recent that happened.

Speaker 1:          02:09:20       Still not, they're not investigating it. You know, you don't hear him a word about it? Well I mean she'd be something

Speaker 5:          02:09:25       that area and PA's a little like that Steubenville situation where it's all some like you know, local good old boys type town with, you know, I'll be honest, I heard rumors while I was there, I can't confirm or deny them and I won't say that they're true cause I don't want to get sued. But the reality is that I always heard rumors that the judges in that county or that two of them in specific would drive drunk all the time and every single day a cop would follow them so that if they veer too far off the road, he would take them out, put them in his car, drive it, and then come back and get his other car 100% I wouldn't doubt it for a God damn that when then whenever someone that had like an issue with drug addiction or something, like they would always clean it up for like a cop's kid or for the judges child or something like that. So, I mean when you talk about a tier justice system, it's ironic that people say, Oh man, technique. You make conscious music, and I always remind them, being conscious doesn't imply that you're going to do anything. It just means you know that something's wrong.

Speaker 1:          02:10:24       But I think that the consciousness of this society is much more aware of the divide and conquer shit that we were talking about in the beginning of the show. That's harder to do today because I don't have a beef with Canada. I don't have a beef with Mexico and have beef with any part of the world. I've met people in other places and they've been just like me and I've talked to people online which showed us just like you know when you see a lot of different people, you're right, but I think that this connection that we're all experiencing online is a very different way of experiencing the world and that the divide and conquer, it's almost impossible now. It's almost impossible as long as we can understand each other. Now, let me ask. If people, for example, they think that something's fake, they think something's not real, then they're upset about it.

Speaker 1:          02:11:06       Let's say people found out right now that the Superbowl was staged just as much as something like wrestling would be all right. Now the injuries are real just like they say it or I say, hey man, you know the wrestling's fake what the injuries are real. You know? I think that people would be on the verge of ripping the place apart. Well you would, you could fake, you could fix a Superbowl, but the fake, the Superbowl would not fake. But obviously to say, all right, we want, we would, we would be more inclined if this team won or if this, and I know people would say that's so impractical. That could never happen. The world series has been accused of being fixed several times. This is what you could do. This is what has been done. What they can do is they can hire referees and make sure that the referees are paid for and bought off and bribed.

Speaker 1:          02:11:52       And then if there is a situation where a questionable call can be made right, where they can call it one way or the other, especially before they used to use instant replays. Right. I mean the instant replay thing clears up a lot of shit. There's a lot of things that, I mean, if a ball's not in a ball is not in. If a dude's foot is out of bounds, the dude's puts out of bounds. If you looking at the instant replays, not much you could say, but before all that man, God damn, they must have rigged a lot of games then. Then basketball referees didn't was a fucking bring those and bringing them out of Philly and what was going on? What was the story? Uh, they had, and I think it was like 12 of them and they were all referees. Yeah. They had it for years.

Speaker 1:          02:12:31       Like they were just on the payroll and hilarious. They were connected. How they got caught is one of the bookies. They ended up tapping like a bookies phone. And so basically the bookies was painting. I'm gonna leave a moment. Well, it only makes sense when you think about the amount of money involved in gambling. You know, that's a thought about a fixed fights too. I mean, the, the real, the fixing fights, it's not like, you know, the champions paying you off to lose. Now the fixing fights is someone is wa wants a bed, a fuck load of money, a fuck load of money. Like here's a good example. And people have said, I'm crazy for thinking this, but Manny Pacquiao, when Manny Pacquiao fought Tim Bradley, Tim Bradley won that fight in no one's eyes, but maybe 10 Bradley's family and a couple of people at home that really hate Manny Pacquiao.

Speaker 1:          02:13:16       Most people saw Manny Pacquiao boxes face off. They saw him not his face off, but he won that fight. He wanted to fight. In my opinion, it was a terrible, terrible decision. But when you find out that someone voted, uh, that someone like put the scores in and that same, someone put the same like really ridiculous score in another fight where it doesn't make any sense. And then you watching over and over again. You seeing these, these scores that don't make any sense. He's seeing these fights that most people thought the fight one fight or clearly won and they have like two fighters are two judges we'll call it where it's a, you know the the one one fires winning by like six, seven, eight rounds and then the other one makes it a draw and you're like how the fuck could that be? Well the way it could be is because then it's not a majority decision and there's unanimous decisions.

Speaker 1:          02:14:04       Rather it's an unanimous decision cause unanimous decision bets. So you can bet a huge amount of money that Manny pack hill is not going to beat Timothy Bradley by unanimous decision. You're going to see, you're going to bet a fucking that it's going to be a split decision and everybody's going to go, are you fucking crazy? You really to take that bet. It's like x to one. No one, no one ever sees split decisions. Well, if one judge has paid off just one judge, all they have to do is say it's a draw and everybody else is like, what the fuck are you talking about? What did you watch? That wasn't a draw. But the guy who makes the money is the guy who paid off the referee to make an a jaw or the judge to make it a draw and they win that bet. Clean

Speaker 2:          02:14:43       the odds on to first, uh, scoring being a touchback safety, safety. I mean incredible what God's word. Like super sick people got rich to us off of that. Yeah. And I mean, I don't know if it's possible that you could just rig that. Is it possible that will be enough. I mean, that would be enough. What's possible or what's it? Yeah, you pay the center off. I mean the center. And so what does he do? What does he have to do in his center? Basically threw the ball over, you know, the quarterback's head. Did you do it on purpose you think? I mean, he did. He didn't do that the whole season. Pretty much do it for $10 million. I mean that's, but then you've got to account for that $10 million. You've got to show why you have that $10 million. Who's to say maybe it's $10 million cash is king. No wash in America, go wash it to cash is king. We all know that a truck load of pussy shows up at his house.

Speaker 1:          02:15:35       Shh. They lower that back door like one of those aircraft carriers where they lower the door.

Speaker 2:          02:15:45       All the girls with keys. Cow. Yeah. Without a doubt. We know the judges had been paid off. We know that referees has been paid off. We know that this corruption, whenever this game just, it gets harder with fighters because at the end of the day, I mean a fighter trains and harder on them to do. It looks, you can see it. It's obvious. Joe has someone, has someone got paid to throw a fight and then I may and UFC

Speaker 1:          02:16:14       not in the unit. I don't know. I shouldn't say no. I said I don't know of him, but I do know of them in pride. In fact, Eddie Bravo, they offered him a fight in Japan and they told him in no uncertain terms that they can make so that he wins the fight and that they can make it so that he wins the fight any way he wants to win. And he thought it was a double cross. He, the way Eddie, Eddie is like, what? What are you talking about? Like you got to fix the fight. First of all, Eddie would never do that. He would never compete in a fake fight. He just wouldn't do it. He wouldn't be able to live with himself. I know him never do it. No matter how much money they paid him. And if he did do it, he would tell people right afterwards I did a fake fight.

Speaker 1:          02:16:53       He wouldn't be able to handle it. He would say, look man, I feel bad, but they gave me a half a million bucks. I had to fucking do it, you know? And he would just joke around about how it happened. He would never fake it. But what they did was they came to him and they told him that. So if that's the case, one of two things are going on. Either they, it would be a double cross where he would go there thing and it was a fake fight and that do it. Beat the shit out of him and he couldn't say nothing. That's possible. Or he could go there and the guy would lay down, the guy would give up or they would have what they would call a hard shoot or like a or a hard work and hard work is you're sparring real hard, you're fucking, the guy will kick you with some leg kicks if shit goes wrong, you could get your draw broken, you could get tagged and get knocked out.

Speaker 1:          02:17:33       I mean there's hard works where a guy loses that he's supposed to win because the guy got injured because something went wrong. Sometimes things happen, but if you're skillful you can make it look like a real fight. And there's for sure that happened in k one for sure that happened in pride for sure. 100% I know there's some dudes that told me themselves that they, through fights, they got paid a shitload of money and they tapped out the Japanese dude, they got caught like heel hooks or something like that. And the guy won and he's a hero and he's like a pro wrestler in Japan was without a doubt there's been some fan and he walks away with like yeah million dollars in like whale blubber. It's possible man. I mean you could come up to some guy, you know, you can take some fighter who doesn't make that much money and if he doesn't have strong ethics and you, you say to him, Hey man, look what we want to pay a lot of money down on you losing by submission to this dude.

Speaker 1:          02:18:24       Cause you know the odds of him submitting you are really small. So what I want to do is set it up so that you know, he doesn't even have to know. You just have to give him a submission. And so they would, you know, they would tangle and you know, he would like give up an arm bar or something like that or give up his neck shooting on a double, a real obvious double where he's like literally lay in there for the gaiety and let the guy tap you. That could happen. I mean it could also happen because a guy makes a brain fart, he forgets and he leaves his neck out there and a dude snatches it up and closes it on him. But it could happen that you give your neck up and guys do give their neck up sometimes when they want out of a fight.

Speaker 1:          02:18:57       Chill son is publicly said that he had some issues with that and his career with pressure that he'd be in big fights. He wound up losing by submission and he's like, he felt like he gave them the submission like you wanted out of there. He left an arm and a guy caught the arm bar. Like you really felt like he just couldn't take the pressure. I was like a subconscious thing telling you, you know we, we talked about that before. About how there's a gentle complacency in failure. It's sometimes people will say, you know what, I could've done that if I tried harder. And that's what they always

Speaker 5:          02:19:28       say as if to say I could have done it. Like that was a possibility, but I just didn't try hard enough that that doesn't make sense for obvious reasons. But at the same time, that eases a lot of the anxiety and the tension that people feel because it's like, all right, you know what? I had a chance to do this and now I don't have to feel the pressure of dealing with, or I've found some measure of success and that's all I really need to deal with. I don't care about anything farther than that. I got what I wanted to get out of this game and that's it. And if I happen to get tons of money, then fuck it.

Speaker 1:          02:20:01       Well, you know, there's some dudes that can definitely find a way to lose and they, uh, the psychological burden of, of trying to get your shit together and when sometimes it's too hard for people, so they almost look to lose to get it over with. That's, that's real. Some people can't take, take pressure. Pressure is a strange thing. And pressure of not knowing the future, the anticipation of something happening and not being able to control it, especially when it deals with physical violence. So me kicking your ass, you know, some dudes just turtle up, they turtle up, try to protect themselves, take a beating and wait for the referee of pull them off. It's happened before. And then there's other guys that we'll never do that. There's other guys that will fight with their last fucking breath and they're just [inaudible] code shit with it. Just like, Yo, you got to, you're going to have to drag me out of here.

Speaker 1:          02:20:41       Yeah. It's in the nature of some guy. And then there's some guys that are just real intelligent. If they start getting hurt though, start to happen. You know like George George Saint Pierre did that early in his career when he fought Matt Hughes. Matt Hughes was, or excuse me, Matt Serra, Matt Serra was fucking him up and he was like, Whoa, this is, I got a tap. It was just getting mounted and pounded on. He started to happen, didn't you know, lost his title, lost his title Matt Serra Cause he was getting fucking pounded on, but he knew, he's like, I am way too hurt. I'm not getting out of this one and this dude's going to put me to sleep and then it's going to be real bad if I don't tap. Some guys don't do that. Some guys rather go out, some guys rather get choked out. They don't tap, you know, war machine.

Speaker 1:          02:21:15       He's going to be on the podcast. Wednesday I'd fucking dude, his last fight, he got caught in a rear naked choke, decided not to tap, just went night night and just went, got choked unconscious. The referee pulled the guy off of him. That's what he said, hey, I'll never got a tap. Like, that's it. I'm fighting to my last breath and if he choked me out, he choked me out. And that, that happens. In fact, his last opponent that the same thing, war machine, put him to sleep, got the guy in the room naked, put them out. I didn't want to tap, didn't want to lose. And that's what happens if this guys like that and there's guys who just tap, they go, you got me. And then they go back to the drawing board. It's hard to say who's more intelligent because, uh, I admire the war machine approach, but I also admire the guy who realizes if I tap, I go back to the gym and I still have a right arm.

Speaker 1:          02:22:00       If I don't tap my fucking arm gets snapped, then I have to go through be, have they going to put bolts in my arm? They gonna fucking have this, you know, put screws in there to keep torn ligaments, be fucked for six months at least it might not ever be the same again. Even when it heals up. There's guys that have gotten injuries where they never came back 100% and that's just part of the game. That's part of reality. So it's who's, who's, who's more intelligent as the guy, more intelligent that taps or the guy more intelligent

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       that says, you know what man, I'm going to figure out a way to win this fight even though I'm in a terrible situation. And if he makes it then he's a hero. And if he doesn't, he goes to sleep. Well, most intelligent is probably the guy who who's bribing him to lose. No, that's the least intelligent cause that's like $20 million getting into trouble. He's going to get, where has he gotten caught yet during that trip and the UFC, has anyone got caught? What did you see? That Russian snooker player who got busted for a sneaker and uh, excuse me, English, the Russian Russian organized crime was a bribing the sneaker, they call it sneaker snowcat pay. I was just out there and they wanted this guy to shots. They wanted them to miss shots. Just, you know, cause he's a really famous world champion player.

Speaker 4:          02:23:11       And a, I think it was hurricane Higgins let's say, but it was a huge scandal because they love this sneaker in England. Yeah. You know, I had a great time when I was out there. Um, I, I gotta Say England to me reminds me of like the same type of enthusiasm that people had and like the 90s for hip hop where they're not afraid to boo somebody, you know, you go, you didn't go to New York, they'll get like an obligatory clap. That's a second one. It's like this tepid sort of loose. It's like, it's Kinda like, you know when your mom made you shake hands with your brother and you hated each other, it's like, hey chick hazard your brother. I fucked this dude. Say Cancer, your brother, I'm gonna smack you in the fucking mouth. Like, all right, thank you. Here you go. I love you bro.

Speaker 4:          02:23:58       Yeah. That thing where you can't wait. You know what I mean? But it's like the people in New York, Yo, you go to like an underground hip hop show. When you go to some shit, they'll sit through an opener that they hate. This is something I, not that I love bullying or something like that and it's just, it's funny to see people, it'd be like, I really don't want to be nice. It'd be nice. I don't know. I come from an era where they were like, get him off the stage. Still exist. Certain certain shows or like that. This is a different says some people's fans that will not tolerate it. Like I saw someone waiting too long for someone to be on stage. I've random fan Joe. He was waiting for Wu Tang. He jumped on the stage. It was like get woo Tang on here.

Speaker 4:          02:24:41       And the the fucking opener was like, oh hold on man. He goes, no man, you suck Dick Money. And I was like God damn yo all that. Just because I'm trying to entertain y'all. Why these motherfuckers smoking weed in her back trying to get this set together. What kind of Shit? But it happens all the time, you know? But in England I just feel like they just have like a more ruthless approach to it. Like I've seen people get booed to fuck off there. They really are like enthusiastic about it. You know, I had, I had a great time. It's just weird because when I walk around there and I meet people, they have no idea what I do if they don't know what I do. And then I walked into a cab for example, and this old man was like, what you do for a living?

Speaker 4:          02:25:22       He said, yeah, you strike me as a type of man to be an entertainer, perhaps a a singer or a rapper. And I was just like, I looked at him and I want him to be like you racist. Fuck. Like what makes you think that I'm at? But then I thought about it for a second. I was like, no, you know, actually I just teach, you know, Middle Age, medieval history and the history of antiquity. And the guy's like, really? And you know he lied to that. No, no, no. Cause Cause I, cause I, I've studied, I studied with her for years. So I mean I had, I had a passion for learning about the past like a few years ago where I really, really got into it. So technically at some of the prison programs that I've done, I've taught, um, the history of antiquity, like Aye. Aye.

Speaker 4:          02:26:02       Aye. Tell kids like, all right, the way that you or anybody in this room will believe in Christianity, Judaism or Islam. People used to believe in these creation mythologies of Sumerian and Mesopotamian times to give people an idea and an impression of a world that exists beyond there where belief is not put into a concrete form. This could be someone's belief, but your belief doesn't necessarily signify that that's exactly what the world is. It's just what you believe the world is. You know, similar to the way people will flip a penny in the air and they think, oh man, it's just 50, 50 and then take the same penny and flick it across the ground and it's not 50, 50. It's 80, 20 that it's going to be tails because the face of Lincoln is a fraction of a gram heavier than the actual monument or the back, or it was on the old copper pennies.

Speaker 4:          02:26:51       So it would fall to similar to the way, if you're holding a TV and spinning in a circle, you're going to fall forward, not backward. So that's what a lot of them are getting. They think they're getting the 50 50 shot from the world, but you're not, you're getting spun across the table from the moment you come out the womb. You know you're going to be in jail here and then they're going to tell you, oh, we want to reintroduce you to society. How are you going to be reintroduced to society? It will never part of in the first place. But back to the point I, this guy, this guy's like, you know, Oh, you do? I was, I going to teach middle aged histories like antiquity. I was like, sir, you know what an antiquity is? You know, Rome, Babylon, Greece, Egypt. He's like, Oh yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:27:27       So I feel like he's tested me on this guy's like, and middle-age English history. You say? I'm like, yeah, you know, I was like, um, it's like, whereabouts there? I was like, you know, Oh, Essex West, Sussex, Sussex, Kent, east Anglia Mercia Northumbria, which was divided in half along with Strathclyde when the Scottish king decided to pledge fealty to the British king and they dial Radia and the rest, Yo. So the dude's like, oh, well there you get into that. So what made you interested in that nun? She's, and leaned over to him. And I was like, you know, to be honest, I was just really tired of motherfuckers mistaken me for some kind of singer, actor every time I stepped in some place. So I wanted to get some new shit to tell people. I didn't seem to be totally cool with it. They got a great sense of humor out there. I love it. I'm a big fan of England. I go there, uh, I, to go there once every year

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       or so and do stand up there. That's a very unique crowd. Very unique crowd over there. Very smart, very well read. Real cool people. You know, they hackle like politely

Speaker 4:          02:28:31       [inaudible] it's not like they want to be a dick, but it's just like haven't paid. I'll give you the alleyoop if you can throw it back in my face, I'll take it. I'll be cool with it like that. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          02:28:44       A good Haeckel, but it's like, it's hard to say what's a good heckle to somebody because the people that suck at it are always going to suck at it and then we were all going to get a good one this time and now you're not going to ruin the show. Some people can be smart and they know what to say at the right time and it's funny and other people, they just ruined the whole thing. But some people plant hecklers, don't they? No. Well not that I know of. Not that I, they do to work off of a, I have never known a single comedian to ever plant someone in the audience and work off of them if they have, if I have heard stories of doing it, it's all been hearsay. I've never, never heard of one person that plants a guy that I think it would be so obvious.

Speaker 1:          02:29:20       I mean people have had people in the audience as a part of a gag, right? They've set things up like as a Jew, like Brian Holtzman, you just always have people in the back of the whole audience. Ask him about his gay son. It was like a gag. It was a bit that he would do and we would always do. Tell us about your gay son and he would go, sir, there's no need to talk about that right now. But since it's been brought up and they would tell this story about his case, it's a fake, you know, just a bit. But we, that would almost be like, that's like the closest to a plant in the audience I've ever heard of. Have you ever heard anybody planting hecklers? Yeah. Yeah. I'll think about it. I've never heard, I don't know. I definitely not a single one of my friends ever done it,

Speaker 4:          02:30:04       but a good heckler will or any good, bad, someone that heckles you in the right way actually gives you fuel as a comedian, don't they? They, it makes you to bounce off of stuff, right?

Speaker 1:          02:30:15       Depends on when they do it, because they could do it in the middle, in the middle of the day. They could do it. I mean, I've had guys yell something stupid out with totally the wrong timing and people pile on them, smack them in the head. I've seen violence break out because of hecklers or people got tired of someone who keeps yelling shit out. I mean, people throw in drinks at each other throwing. I've seen people throw chairs at each other because of the hecklers from most part hecklers or cons. They're just annoying. Shitheads that need attention and don't deserve it. I liked, uh, what was I think, I don't know if he played it the first time I was here, the Bill Hicks, uh, response to the hecklers.

Speaker 4:          02:30:47       Oh my God. Cause I'm a cop and he goes, I can, I don't have a cock. I could yell at performers. Did I run into people like that? It, God bless their hearts and 99% of the people at the shows that I do are total soldier supporters. And then there's like the 1% that they're just there to just fuck around and play these stupid little games and it's like they'll put, I'm like, Yo, please no flash. And they're like, well, why not? And I'm just like, listen, you take one flash photo with a day that doesn't bother you. But if I get up 800 of these fucking things everyday, I'm going to go blind tomorrow. And they're like, well, can you just take mine then instead I was like, no, you're not understanding me. You're going to turn the flash off or you're going to leave. Oh, well w w w w I'm like, okay, you're drunk. It's the countdown to when my first name becomes, fuck you get this fucker out of here. Leave. And the security is not here to protect me. They're here to protect the U for me because when I flip out, I'm going to snap your neck like a breadstick for fucking green.

Speaker 2:          02:31:51       No, this is all violent talk and I'm not really comfortable with it, especially in the [inaudible] story or drunk fan. Not trying to have a good time though. You never beat up a fan right now. I've got too crazy. He never beat him a van. They got too crazy. You're fucking lying to you never beat up a fan. What about another comedian?

Speaker 4:          02:32:09       No. And that would be to have a comedian. Never. It doesn't have to go to that. It's silly

Speaker 2:          02:32:15       bullshit. Fucking [inaudible] beat up a kid. Never beat up a fan. It wouldn't

Speaker 4:          02:32:22       do it. This is stupid. I mean, if I'm fighting someone's defend myself. No, I don't want, I'm trying to make is 99% of the people that come to the shows total down or totally cool. Damn difference. That little guy, that would be like, if you had a 300 person show to be three assholes, every 300 persons shall be three people screaming shit out. It's more than 99 did you gotta understand? Usually those people get kicked out in the middle of it because I honestly, hip hop shows, they have a lot of ejections. Yeah, I'm still getting, my show's going to get kicked out before I get on stage, you know, get cold. There'll be heckling the guys on before me and the the security of the venue. We usually get rid of them before I get up there. Do you bring your own openness to this stuff?

Speaker 4:          02:33:01       Yeah, always. Okay. If you don't and you get stuck with Shitty Comedians, Matt, and you get stuck with dudes who will step on your material too. That's another thing that like bad comics will do. Even if they're not stealing, like say if you've got a bit about Mike Tyson, they'll come up with a new bit about Mike Tyson and just do it right before you so that the subject is already stale by the time he gets called stepping on your material. We call it, we call it set trippin. Uh, okay. Like you trip on someone's set, like you take a piece of what they, what they did on this set. Like maybe it won't be exactly the same thing, but you'll do the same call and response to the audience again and again. Or you'll have a verse or a song about the same kind of thing. Or you'll give an introduction or a speech about a song that has the same kind of connotation that somebody else will, and then that person, then the headliner gets on and we're almost like, oh well we heard this already with your kiddos.

Speaker 4:          02:33:51       That was a, that was one man. See his tricks and say you should do that. Right before he would bring guys up, he would do their best bits. Like he did this, this dude Johnny Sanchez man. It was a funny dude. He had this great bit about um, uh, Iranians po and the been mad at him for parking in their parking spot and yelling at him in broken English. He had this funny bit and men see they were taping at TV, show him and see what's hosting and he's just jacked his bit and did it right before him. So this is closing bit

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       and the dude's doing it right before he goes up there and he's just like, he's got no weapons is going up there, unarmed. He's been not only that, he's going up there with the, with the emotional burden at this shithead just stole a bit right before he goes on stage and it was a, that was what he would do. Like you would see him at the comedy store, he would do one of Paul Mooneys bits and then Moonee would go on later on in the night and do the same bit instead of, you know, Mexicans, he'd be talking about black people. They would be the same bit. We already heard this star. Take the top and take it out and then put the other thing in there. Yeah. Yeah. That's a, that's a very extreme form of a stepping on your material, but it happens all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:34:59       When guys I talked to guys to this day that are on the road and there'll be the headline or in the Middle Act always wants to be the headliner. They'll want to one day be the headline. They want to blow the headliner off the stage. They love talent. People love saying, Oh, this guy couldn't follow me. Yeah. I middled forum in West Virginia and he couldn't follow me. People love that. So they'll, they'll fuck with you. Like you have to bring your own guys. You want to bring, you don't want that sort of competitive sense that backstab you bullshit. That's no fun. So then you're really arranging is a package deal for you and the other people that also ranging that the people go on before me are really funny that that goes without saying. But the most important part to me, because the worst thing you want to do is go on after someone eats it.

Speaker 1:          02:35:40       When you go on, after someone's bombing on stage, it's sucks, man. The crowd isn't a bad mommy about it. Dude, tell me about it. They don't want to fucking, they don't want to believe that they paid money to see this asshole talk and you got to do you. You're not coming in. And also that associated would shoot as if, oh, you brought this person, show me what the nose suck. Yeah, they think you suck. They think, and a lot of comics do that though, man. They stack the deck. They'll bring really shitty opening acts to make them look like a hero. They come in and rescue it. A lot of dudes do that. That bring terrible, terrible opening acts on purpose or people. How about people who pay to open up? Why? No, no, I've never heard of that. But I know Tony Hinchcliffe. It's got to be opening up for a dude and then the dude stopped using him and started using a guy who was way worse than him.

Speaker 1:          02:36:25       And the only thing that made any sense was that he just thought Tony was too strong. This, this guys that do that, man, there's, there's a few guys that do that kind of shit. They want them, they want to make sure they're the star and then the guy before him, it doesn't make it hard for them. The audience thing I was thinking of by the way, it was, uh, I think, uh, Andy Kaufman used to do that. Oh, did it. And that makes sense. Any Kaufman was more of a performance art is a showman. Yeah. I never thought he was a funny stand up cause he really wasn't. He was a really funny guy. He was a great actor. He was a fascinating character study. You know, he did a lot of weird shit like he would, he would work at Jerry's Deli when he was on taxi, he was on tax, he was on a hit sitcom and it would work as a real busboy at Jerry's Deli.

Speaker 1:          02:37:08       So he would go to Jerry's Deli and like wait tables and like clean. That's probably where he got a lot of material need to fucking people that are rambling at some Deli table and some shitbox place where he's working. I think it was more of a performance art piece. He wanted people to freak out the fact that this guy who on the biggest hit television show on in America, he was working washing tables. I mean it was, it was, uh, he was like, he would read books on stage. Like he would go on stage and play a mighty mouse. Here I come to save the day over and over and over again and just stand there and go here where I can call them to save the day. And he would do it for like a half hour. The He, it was like performance art more even than it was.

Speaker 1:          02:37:49       That does sound like some avant garde bullshit. If I saw that, if I paid fucking 24 with my dreams, God knows what the fuck he was on. Who's a d. He did a lot of transcendental meditation. I know that he was a big TM guy. He might, I think he might've actually been clean and sober and just into really like heavy meditation, but he did a lot of crazy shit. Like the thing he did wear his wrestling women, well he would do pro wrestling and get really slapped down by these guys and get beat up by these guys. He would challenge them and then he would wrestle women. He would like, like say that he was the Inter gender champion exclusively. I'll fight any woman in there and they would all go crazy thinking he was serious. It was all performance art, but it was, you know, in that context it's undeniably genius. I mean what he did was incredible stuff because just he, he always lost by the way, and he just made everybody angry. I mean it was a performance, like if he wanted to, he's scrawny is fucking all that good. But if he really wanted to kick that chick's acids, come on. She a small woman. He's letting her be now.

Speaker 1:          02:39:01       Well I'm not, and that's Bob's a Moodle. Who's his friend who was a referee? It's a joke.

Speaker 7:          02:39:06       Let me get in my concerts. I've learned a lot about it by just doing it, but I wanted to, can we capture the old days of the carnivals where any before it in the main room, wrestlers used to go from town to town and carnivals and all for $500 to any man that could last in the ring with them for three minutes. So I figured if I could offer a prize and make it like a contest,

Speaker 1:          02:39:29       it can get, he gets to like grab women and like, yeah, he's trying to pin her now. He's actually pinning it for real.

Speaker 7:          02:39:35       But I couldn't probably, well challenge men in the audience because I'd get beaten. Right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:39:39       Right.

Speaker 7:          02:39:42       Stronger than me. So I figured if I challenge women, there are enough women who are almost as big or as big as me, who they would have a good chance to beat me.

Speaker 1:          02:39:53       I love that he said that with a straight face. Joe, what was his alter ego? His name? Tony. Tony Clifton. Clifton. Tony Clifton. Yeah. Which was actually, yeah, that was his, uh, was bombs and mood. It's still does Tony Clifton, right. He still puts on like an outfit. Pretends he's Tony Clifton says Tony Clifton.

Speaker 6:          02:40:14       It is like a whole cult, cult Deb. A few, but I believe that he's still alive. Right? Yeah. People believe crop.

Speaker 1:          02:40:19       Well, they believe everybody's alive. Tupacs so I've Kennedy still alive. I've heard Elvis is still alive.

Speaker 6:          02:40:25       Nobody late. Bruce Lee. I've heard that one yet. See, so did you get in an argument with Tupac when he was alive back in the day? Well, we were teenagers. I wouldn't necessarily call it an reo when argument, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:40:41       Okay.

Speaker 6:          02:40:42       So that's a no, Brian, luckily. And uh, you know, luckily we talked about it before he passed, so everything is all good.

Speaker 1:          02:40:48       That's, that's nice. Yeah. That's good. That must be an interesting thing though. No, dude like that man, you know? Right. For sure. That's an interesting thing, right? Think about it. You know that dude, and then he vanished one of the greatest rappers ever. Right. And then gone and then still, no one knows who killed him. That's what's really crazy about it. One of the most crazy things ever.

Speaker 6:          02:41:10       Yeah. The, the whole thing, the whole thing, the biggie thing. Like it's like, oh, miss and not talking to not be solved. You know what I mean? Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:41:20       yeah. How could it not be solved? Right. How could it not be solved? How was it possible? How's it humanly possible that in 2014 that hasn't been resolved? And then what you ever read that rolling stone piece on the whole thing, right. Find out the rampart guys were all corrupt us. Fucking crazy, man. It's, it's an interesting too that that era of, of rap, like those were the two prominent personalities. And both of them died. Shootouts. You know what a fucked up situation. Yup. Like does he know about, yeah, we're just talking about that. Yeah. No, that's crazy man. To think that you know in the middle of the Strip in Vegas. Yeah. Yeah. Especially in Vegas

Speaker 6:          02:42:03       with all, with all the surveillance cameras is when everything was crazy. Yeah. It's insane. It's insane to think that no one caught anybody. No one caught anybody. Her read something about the guy. I can't recall the guy's name, the guy who last year I was involved with the whole, he ended up being found in the bear mountain and he burned them out. The former police officer, some kind of way. There was an intermingling with rampart and that and that whole situation much more recent.

Speaker 1:          02:42:29       He was a police officer after that, but this without a doubt, if there was the kind of level of corruption that rampart it had, there has to be something left over. I mean the idea that they cleaned it off, spic and span and nice and pretty clean and polished it up and the old no whatsoever. No having problems. Now with the sheriff's department, are they in what way? Leave Bucca same thing that they have like an inner culture within the sheriff and they favored certain police officers and certain people, especially with the whole, since the sheriff controls the jail systems in California, so a lot of them are getting, you know what corruption and bribery and it happens man. Ultimate power corrupts just nothing. There's no way around it. Just basically

Speaker 8:          02:43:12       Chevrolet Bucca knew about it and just turn, turn the cheek on it, you know what I mean? He did the Joe Paterno basically. I mean, you know, and the thing is is they, they caught like a core of them and they have like what happened is internal affairs hired an inmate and he's an informant. So the enemy was getting cell phones, drugs. Oh. So they actually got an inmate to be yeah. And basically gave up the sheriff and they kept finding out. So they build a whole case it, you know, a few years about it. And what they did is the sheriff move the inmate and they couldn't locate him. His attorney or his handler couldn't locate him inside the jail system. So they, you know, the, if finally the pressure came to sheriff Lee Baca and he just basically turned the cheek and it took them for a while, like they start harassing him. Like he got really, really serious because his, his handler couldn't find them. Like, what do you mean you can't find them inside the jail system?

Speaker 1:          02:44:05       Wow. That's interesting man. Yeah, I think that's going to be real hard to do their, their whole culture, the culture of law enforcement is having to adapt. Yeah. It's a whole different, it has to adapt because people find out about shit way quicker today. It's so easy to spread the news, social media, camera, camera people like, I can't imagine all the abuses motherfuckers got away with before this camera.

Speaker 8:          02:44:29       Think about it as the actual phone that they snuck in and gave to him and he was sending to inmates was where a lot of that evidence was coming in front of you. Cause the phone and he's taking pictures of everything. Whites. Wow. It's already inside, you know?

Speaker 1:          02:44:42       Well, you know, it's gonna be harder and harder for those motherfuckers to do shit like that. But if there's any where they're gonna be able to pull it off, it is in prison where they can control people. So, so in every case, the sale and then, you know, it was when Joe was locked. Um, he was telling me crazy story that at that federal prison where he was at, they said that there was a scandal where like the, the guards had, the female CEO's have been selling pussy to inmates. That's so common. It's like four or 5,000 a pounds of, when we had Victor Conte, he was the guy who got busted the ball called scandal. Remember that with Barry Bonds and their salaries got steroids. He was in prison and they were, they were all banging this, the, the female guards that female guards returning tricks.

Speaker 1:          02:45:22       Wow. That's crazy. I love it. That's American ingenuity. You're in the middle of nowhere. You know, what do those guys need? Pussy. What'd she have to sell puts? Hey, let's make a deal. Let's make a deal. Husband is somewhere like you were watching her husband. They probably fucking selling ass both of them together. They work in the same institution. Hey, easy. She was just, what does that bad am I lying? Joe's no gay people in jail. The want a good blow job from a nice security guy. Oh God, I'm going to have to frisk you. They about probably had like a little game with their play. Keeping it real goes, what are you going to first? What are your real goals? Way Wrong. Don't make me suck it. I'm a, I'm an officer of the law. You suck it. Give the guy a fat envelope that he had been hiding up his ass.

Speaker 1:          02:46:07       Is that a security is a female security guard that you have to fuck, but you know what? You would take it man. If you were locked up for a long time, that that's better than nothing. Sure. Yeah, so girls who would never be able to sell pussy on the outside on the inside, it's a valuable commodity. Their Miss America text checked out every too many images in his head. This was one podcast you could tell flabbergasted. Shocked. It's just funny because every time I turn around you got to get Brian to stop putting shit up there. You're like, that's part of the fun part of the show is contracting me to understand society craves conflict. You can't just have a smooth running show. You have to have some things. Brian Interior drunk come and do the openers for Joe Sometimes. Uh, he's still alive now.

Speaker 1:          02:46:56       I have it don't once in a while. All right, so he does comedy on his own. You bring, you bring your own openers, your little homies too. Yeah. Okay. Dues. Do you set them up like any hecklers and shit like that shit would be so obvious, man. No, it wouldn't do, oh listen. It wouldn't be a smart thing to do first of all because it would be fake and then the, the fake vibe would get out there somehow or another, they would sneak through the fucking button. If it's part of, show me the performance. If you're not doing it to get to what you're doing. It depends on what you're doing. I mean you can set up something in the audience where you have like a fake fight with somebody and the whole thing is like, yeah, you could do it. But the way I feel about standup when I, if I went to see Joey Diaz, okay, it was my favorite comedian and if Joey Diaz had someone go on in the audience and fake heckle him and he had all these canned lines, he threw it that and I thought it was brilliant.

Speaker 1:          02:47:48       But then I found out that it was fake. I would be, I would feel sick. I'd feel grossed out if I ever did that. I would feel sick if I ever like tricked a bunch of people to think that I came up with a smooth line when when someone heckles me and I come up with something on the fly and it nails them and then they look really stupid. That's like an art. There's an art to finding the right thing to say at the right time. We were in Ohio, we had this fucking dude took his shirt off and he was standing in the crowd with his shirt off. I mean it was, you couldn't, you couldn't plant a better guy. I think I saw that as a video. The dude was crazy and Brian and I saw him hours later, like after the show.

Speaker 1:          02:48:26       I mean I hugged the guy and everything. I mean he wasn't a violent guy, but someone decided to like take advantage of the fact that it was this loud guy and they'd beat the shit out of him. We found him when we were getting to our car like two o'clock in the morning, we were leaving that steak and shake. Right. We had eight and we, we've got to our car and this dude was fucked up man. His eyes bloody blood common all over his fucking, all over his clothes. He was somebody who just beat the shit out of him, man for heckling. Yeah. Well probably this is the guy. Look, you guys got no shirt on and the audience

Speaker 3:          02:49:01       with his finger. Oh Damn Yard.

Speaker 9:          02:49:08       Hey,

Speaker 1:          02:49:12       that's that is that guy personified. It's got no shirt on fucking dues. I wish we got the video of him fucked up later in the night. We should do like a bloody pulp because it would have been so perfect. The perfect way to end that video. Somebody who gets tuned him up, it was a free shot because he was so drunk they could take advantage of it. You guys got to leave. We've got to wrap this thing up. Anyway, we're running up the top five, 10 minutes. I wanted to ask you one thing before we go. We only have five minutes left, but um, you, you were, you specialized like in ancient history and you're, you're, you're really a big fan of like ancient cultures. Have you paid attention to any of this go Beckley Tepi Shit that they're finding in Turkey? What the, the arc? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          02:49:53       Go. Beckley Tapi is a new structure that they found. It was like a cattle herder or something like that. Found this stone and uncovered it, like kicked some dirt around on it and then started digging around it and they realize it's massive. Called in some people, they found out that the whole area had been filled with dirt on purpose at the very earliest 12,000 years ago. Right? So it's at least 12,000 years old and that's when it was fully covered. That's one was filled in and it's this huge gigantic structure because I think a Iran, all these look like there's some images of what they've discovered so far. Why are fucking images loading so slow? What is it, 1990 it's just a fucking geo cities website. There's um, gigantic, 19 foot tall stone columns, the, all the, all these reliefs, three d reliefs of these animals that are drawn on it.

Speaker 1:          02:50:45       But this whole thing throws the origins or the, the, the dates of civilization into a, a kind of a chaotic situation because it's so old. It's at a time where they thought people would just basically hunter and gatherers and these hundred gathers, created these enormous stone structures is really complex thing. Like all his carvings on it. And these are three d reliefs, meaning that they took the stone away, they cut it away to make this image. They didn't carve it into this stone, which would be the easy way to do it. They carved the stone out and left the three dimensional image of these, you know, animals and they've only uncovered 5% of it so far, and it's fucking enormous, enormous stone structure that was covered up. So they know for a fact that, and this is in central Turkey, it's in, uh, it's an area called Gold Beckley, Beckley, Tempe. I don't know. Um, I don't, I know that the,

Speaker 4:          02:51:36       it was, there was a civilization called the Hittites that lived in central Turkey and they had this site Hook Tusha. And what I think is interesting about that is that it was totally in it, miles and miles away from water. In other words, most of these civilizations take place near some sort of river near some sort of stream. But the ironic thing about this, civilizations existed for thousands of years in Turkey and yet there was no water that was physically

Speaker 5:          02:52:06       near it. There was like 50 miles away. So you're going to tell me every single day someone rode 50 miles to get water. And they were saying what was going on was probably that there was an internal spring that allowed for there to be water inside a city for it to flourish to the level it did. Could be, they also had an irrigation back then too. Well that is one, one suggestion, but they didn't have an aqueduct. The similar to the way people look at them in, in Roman times and I guess they may have diverted water through a stream or, or by damming a river. But whatever the case may be is I think people are going to start finding more and more of these things as time progresses. And I think what we're talking about also is that, uh, not just on land but also on, see, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:52:48       In, in the seat when you go underwater. People found recently that there were, uh, ancient Egyptian civilizations are people in the Middle Eastern Mediterranean, but it existed for like three, 4,000 years that have been buried because in reality there were probably plenty of places that were above sea level, you know, 10,000 years ago. Oh, no question about it. The, the, the, the tide or rather the ocean's levels have risen and fallen fruit. No doubt, no doubt, no question. You know, but besides rap, I started writing a book recently and then one of them, I'm specifically going to be able to deal with this specific fact and, and the, the history of humankind that is severely underwritten. I mean, this is what you're writing a history book and that wouldn't say what's not a history book. It's more like a book of philosophy. It's more like a book of philosophies, you know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          02:53:34       And it's a little humorous, you know what I mean? It couldn't, cause I, I, I want to show people the sort of perpetual hypocrisy that we're willing to live in, that people have always lived in some ways. I mean, there were, but not only that we live in, but that we're willing to live in. You know, it's, it reminds me of a quote from Mark Twain where he's like, you know, the difference between writing fiction and writing reality is that you have to make reality seem believable. You know, because it's so preposterous that you have to include some sort of element that brings it home, similar to the way that a comedian will criticize society and then talk about how fucked up it is. And at the end of it say, Hey, well guess what? I'm just as fucked. And you know how I know it's this fucking bad because I'm part of this fucked up society.

Speaker 5:          02:54:18       And that's the ironic part of the joke, cause that, you know what I mean? Oh No, no, no, no. I'm the coca sub and I'm going to go get a coke now. So fuck all the rest of you because that's just how it is. I think that when you look at civilizations in the human development, you find just a series of, of, of pure savagery and then you find a nobleman and strange and, and almost irreconcilable places within that society. So when I look at them over the course of human evolution, I really wanted to address that. And the fact that, you know, yes, we're a civilization of talking monkeys that have achieved some sort of growth over the years, whether it's through grooming because we place a gigantic, uh, we place a gigantic amount of value on how were groomed. We placed a gigantic amount of value on our superstitions.

Speaker 5:          02:55:08       In other words, if I believe something and you don't believe the same thing, I'm threatened by your belief system, not you or me specifically, but in terms of how we communicate and how we've communicated over the years. Now, has that always been a positive thing or has it always been a negative thing? Well, when we were dividing ourselves among different actual races like homo erectus or Homo Habilis, then maybe it was a positive thing to not include these people in our society because, or these animals are hominids in our society because it wouldn't created a bunch of different strand of humanity.
