Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day he was sitting there was still that kind of prestigious like app after he lost that and it's like, oh fuck it. Yeah, we can. Coach coaches were saying that his, his own mma coach, after he knocked out, Brett Rogers said that fate or one with his old tricks, but he would have liked to have him for more time training and he thinks he's not, he's not approaching it correctly and he just won by being fader. But he also caught, oh, uh, for doom with that old trick. He caught him, knocked him down, and then the mistake of federal members, he jumped into his guard, but remember he jumped into pound, but he caught him really, really well. Knocked him down with the exact same time that he did to everybody before that. So maybe maybe, or maybe Verdugo goes down on purpose the moment a punch him so he could drag you into, which he does.

Speaker 1:          00:57          He's a smart guy. We're doing is a very smart guy. Fight fights than Saturday. Definitely did not face first because he got tagged. If you watch the stoppage, if you see if you can find the highlight, I'll show it to you because this is something that I wish somebody brought up during the actual commentary. He got tagged right before he got knocked out. He got tagged doing the same thing with the right hand. He moved forward. He was making these advances. He moved forward. He got tagged with that right hand and I think he was on Queer Street and I think he went running at steep a on queer street and got knocked the fuck out and the way they did it was a fucking work of art. The angle, it was like Anderson Silva and forest baby step to the right and even better. His angle was sick and obviously his right hand was nasty.

Speaker 1:          01:44          It's also volume did get hit early and in boardrooms training. If you've seen him train it, there's this competition within that. Jim, when you get hit it's like, oh, got to get them back. I think it was more gets hit and he was like, go charging bull. And was like, fuck this man. I think it's probably a little of both. I agree because I definitely think both. He got crack crack and I'm like, well that is a big right hand that he got hit with and it's in the same manner. Same managed charging. 40 got hit. That's how although got knocked out against Mcgregor. Yep. You got to be fucking real careful charging for harder because. And you know, Steve Bay's not got some great guys, but he's not a knockout artist per se. If you compare them to like a mark Nelson, he's not knockout artist when the guy's charging in like that and then you're counting with right hand, it makes it seem way.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Well here's my take on steep based power. I think Steve Bay has big power, but I think he fights economically and intelligently. He's a smooth fighter, a boxer. He's a very good boxer, a golden gloves boxer, but he's smooth and relaxed in the way he spars. It's one of the things that makes them so dangerous because as he does things very correctly, you know, and I think, you know, DC was on the commentary for the UFC recently. He was talking about getting the rub, you know, he was talking about that experience. When you have a tough fight with someone, you get the rub and he fought junior dos Santos and they went to war. What do you mean rubbed? This is what I mean, what he was saying. He's like, Daniel says, when you fight someone that's really good and they're better than you, even if you lose you, it elevates you.

Speaker 1:          03:16          You get the rub like just by sharing the ring with them just by being in that re, by competing with them, you realize how good you are when you actually get better and you realize how good that person is. Yeah. I think he got the rub when he fought junior dos Santos in a way because he went five rounds with a guy who was the one of the toughest of the tough guy was at Warren, a champion or knocked out Cain Velasquez was one punch and he went five hard rounds with them and the decision will could have went either way and took his best shot. And I also think that to go back to [inaudible] point and your point with the rub, I think at the UTC level of special wouldn't get in that top echelon. You know, you're getting, people are telling you you're good, but like when he beat Orlowski starched them.

Speaker 1:          03:55          You don't learn much from that man. When he go up to a decision with a world class guy, then you know, like you're doing something right, your camp, you're doing it right, you had good gas, you realize what works, what does it. So you learn so much more and he's going to, like you said, more with jds and we see them getting better and better. What's really interesting now is here's the dark horse that nobody talks about. Stephan Struve is only 28 years old. That fucking dude is gigantic. He's seven feet tall. And if he could put it together and he put it together on big foot silver the other night, knocked him out. I love the guy has a bunch of knockout losses. I know he does, but he knocked out steepbank. Struve got steeper in the UFC. Yeah, dude, Dude Struve do not count that guy out yet.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Struve did an inside leg kick and then he's got that heart issue and stuff. Well, I don't know what he's got going on physically, but I'm saying that kid, if he puts it all together when you're seven feet tall, how long does it take before you even get coordinated? Right. I mean it's like you're sending a message and it's got to go so far before it gets to your fucking hand. I mean, have you ever thought you fought guys are super tall like Jack Man, those guys. I mean it like. The thing is is steep aid would be, or not Steve, a strew would be such a fricking handful of could learn to use his reach, but you guys like Roy Nelson. When you get these upper echelon guys, you know, nothing gets bigfoot but off trt or whatever the case, he actually needs it off it.

Speaker 1:          05:26          It's, I think anyone that top 20 kinda them up, but with truth, the real test of me who they give them next, that's true. Got fucked up. I over him and over and was joy superintelligent. Fight the way father, it took him down. Beautiful. Take down on top of him. Just ground and pound. The thing about struve's, you've got to realize that kid has I think 40 fights. Yeah. Here's a shitload of miles now. His heart, heart and the mark. What will have it does not. No, but it's. I don't know what he's got. What is the medical condition? I forget. We have the same manager, so he deals with it all the time. That Mark Hunt knockouts, Jesus Christ Marco, would that leaching left hook shattered his face. Oh Dude. Mark on it. So fucking you've been caged. Sad scene that. Oh, it's fast. Too steep a can get.

Speaker 1:          06:13          I'm curious to see if they can get but within boxing distance of allister and take away any of those kicks and how he sets it up. It's going to be interesting. Alster combox man. He can't. Oh yeah, for sure. Better than to tell you knocked out junior with one punch. That's good. He's the best striker in the UFC heavyweight division maybe of all time. So. So. So Steve, Steve Bay, then it's going to have to close that distance and knocks him. Not necessarily note Steve Bay could crack him. Look, Ben Rothwell knocked him out in the first round cup. Has better fulfilled, can happen. Footwork and house has been stopped a lot. Chins the question. This is the other thing people forget with allister. Then we'll fucking grapple. Oh yeah. In wrestling. Grappling his ass off. So you want to go to the ground with them? You're gonna be in a world of trouble.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Well he won the Abu Dhabi European trials and in pride he submitted tour. He's got an. He also submitted Mark Hunt. He has a nasty guillotine. Dude. His team always forgetting about birthing of just as a striker, but you want to go to the ground. I don't think Steve Bay has a lot of submission. Work under is so steep and I trained for two years together. That kid has submission defense. So you're not were shot as his black belt. If you asked Rashad to show you like Omoplata a real specific, uh, offensive move. It's, I don't think at that black belt level, but his defense and that's steep based defense is nes super nasty. It's just what? He's really good at. Defense. He's a very smart athlete, you know, and it's when you have a guy who's a who could probably be a professional ball player, right? You Will Bay.

Speaker 1:          07:44          He could probably be a professional ball. He didn't make it. Yeah, he didn't make it. He's at this level of an, of an athlete. Now. What I'm saying is it's rare that you see a guy like that who comes over to mma and fights like super technical, super smart, who's also really, really tough firefighter for professional, full time head. His head is the biggest head I've ever, ever seen into large set. Nicest guy. He's a great guy, but he's. He's got a rare set of attributes, meaning that he's at pro sports athlete level, like as far as like like his, his ability, his movement and his intelligence in his approach and his training and then on top of that he's tough as fuck stuff is tough as fuck. Like in this fight. Let me tell you something, dude, I watched this fight very careful and one of the things that I was noticing was how calm he was through everything through the walk.

Speaker 1:          08:37          When they watch, when they're staring each other down. One of the things you really pay attention to is the shortness of the breathing. If you watch people breathing during, I'm like nervous situations. A lot of times even if they look calm, you could sort of see this uneasiness in the way they're taking in oxygen. You're sensing tension, not seeing. You don't sense any of that shit looking at, you know what's impressive to if he doesn't come from like a mastermind camp? No, it's just his boys and Cleveland. Well, he just might have a mastermind can be. There's a lot of masterminds out there that don't have the right pupils. I'm saying he's not from like a Jackson's Aka the att. He kicks his shit within Cleveland and does work and then goes and saves people from burning buildings. Who else is in that? That camp is the guard style.

Speaker 1:          09:21          MMA. There's also the. Isn't there a Leslie Smith from there? No, it's not. Raquel Pennington, Right Jessica? I'm Jessica. I'm so. They have tough fighters. It's just like if a guy's like a really skillful trainer and you know you've only been doing it for a few years, you have to wait for the right guy to sort of walk through your door. Then walking through the door with Eddie Bravo with Eddie Bravo. Took forever for him to find someone who could do his style and prove in competition that it's very effective. Not just with him. He had a unique style phase. Brother or dad. The guy with the mustache. I look at that guy with a mustache, guys. Awesome. Though. You talked about being calm. Remember he's fighting right now. That guy's not that old. Brian. Why are you calling that guy his dad? Because his older brother, his older brother. I guarantee it all.

Speaker 1:          10:13          Just some fucking thick dude. You Know Eddie Bravo had a real good point about this. We were talking about on the phone. He was like, Fabrizio look too relaxed. He liked. He was coming up to the, to the ring. He was making that face that he may say, yeah, I'm so sick of that face. Oh, he's being funny. It's being silly. I don't think there's anything wrong with a fighter trying to stay loose. Don't at all. You know. I think that's one of the things that fabrizio does to have a good time. He likes to make that silly. He's been doing it forever. He's the man he's bullied for ever do them. If you won the fight and made that face, no one say a fucking word. If you went out there and head kicked, steep meo chick, you know, no one would say a word, but it didn't work out.

Speaker 1:          10:50          So when it doesn't work out, that's when everybody comes shitting on you. It's the same. What's the same with connor? Connor? Connor was walking out like, you know, same with Rhonda. When Ronda lost everybody's mad at all the shit that they loved her for, they love to for don't be a do nothing, bitch and fuck you. I'm making it to the top. Kiss my ass. Or they hate it. They now we think she's arrogant to that. Same with Canada. If he's in Venice right now, driving around a royals Royce just wiling out, look, I just, you know, it's just what comes. It's part of what people love about people bragging or they want to bring you down though, man. Look how loose deep it looks because loose. I mean he's fighting for the title nice and loose, so he moves away. Keeping argued. He should've got title earlier too, but he's like, he's just such a nice guy and a lot of checking to.

Speaker 1:          11:42          Lot of good checking of kicks, a kid's ties. Very good luck. Very educated with his movements and look for breezy. Who's got some fucking nasty kicks man? And he's like right there. His striking is much improved. We saw it in the Travis Brown fight, man. Dangerous on the feet, man. Alaska is dude. His striking is fucking legit. He's long shit and he's got confidence in it. That nice switch kick there. Yeah, but he's a beast. I think in order to be that dangerous of a fighter, you're going to have to open yourself up a little bit. Then when you fight a real strategic guy like steep a, you're to get a little bit of trouble. Well, I think what happened in this fight in particular is that he forced it. Yes, thank. He was in this gigantic soccer arena. It's the biggest crowd in history and mma in Brazil.

Speaker 1:          12:28          Look at that beautiful leg kick though though. Yeah, the inside 90 Chad that to. Yeah, it's all nice. Like the technique is real nice, but I think for Breesa was just so ramped up because there's all these people in Brazil and I think he's a confident man. I think he thinks he's the fucking best in the world. He just has to get ahold of this dude. There's a right hand and nailed the. See, so now we can take a shot tab. But now. But now look, he's forcing it. Forcing it because he landed it. Yeah. So Watch. When he starts to force it, he gets hit real hard and then he gets hit hard and knocked out. He tried that knee, tries forward and when sees he got a terrible single attempt there. That was like such a. you're like getting steeper on that. He was also, I mean he might've been just trying to make them work, but look, maybe open up possibilities.

Speaker 1:          13:14          I think you dropped for a single mind. Right? And so he's not afraid to just be writing their girls. Not though be he's not reading range, but he's real relaxed. Even the waste throwing that chap, that top, top, top now like he's economical and when your economical and a five round fight super chat. I was a very nice legs by fabrizio. He's timing that jasmine great inside leg kick in. The Jab also is super light. Like he's just floating it out there. Pop his nice lots of steps. 20 Jepson. We stepped to the side there like that. Like look at that jacket on sale like that is to talk, you know he's not, there's no tension there. You know what I'm saying? Like it's like flowing a check that link again, nice leg kick by. Steep. A nice switch.

Speaker 1:          13:59          So right now for Mesa was realizing like, okay, this is an easy part. That's the one you're reading right here. Bang. That's the chaos. Now back it up again, watch just just back it up just a little bit to where it's chasing them. So watching these channels, he got rocky NBA players. Really? You're correct. You're right. I saw the correct though, Joe. I didn't see that until. And he got mad and he came out. Yes, yes. He got his tag. Yeah. He got tagged hard with that right hand. That's right. And then he kept charging and then he got face planted with the second one that, that first right hand had him on Queer Street. I guarantee you because he's moving forward and steep a drops it in on them and it's the same punch he knocked him out with and it's when when Steve Bay throws a punch and this is how, you know he's good at me, obviously fucking good, but this is how you, you know, techniques at a real high level.

Speaker 1:          14:48          His arm is like loose and then he throws it and then as it gets to his face he tightens it down. It does this stack like as he's moving away, he's like, it's a super efficient, like really technical punch to the throat that way. Moving back back. In that sense, it's very much like what Anderson did. Forrest Griffin. It's also calculated because you threw it twice and they both land and there built. You can tell they're working on it. So he threw. He threw the, the, the, the left hook twice to check, right? Yeah. Moving back, moving back and something as he stepped into the side when he does that or you had to guess it doesn't even necessarily have to be that he planned it out and that was a part of the game plan. I think Steve Bay does that. I think he's a really good striker.

Speaker 1:          15:33          If you look at his movie. Yeah, and I think you're looking at a guy who's super fucking determined, man. Steve Bay is super determined and when you're a guy that's that focused, you're going to get fucking really good at everything. So after he gets that fight, that Jab, Jab, it's like an upper customer. It is too. It's so everything he's doing is so relaxed and efficient. You don't see a lot of jazz for Bluetooth. Can you see a lot of jobs? Like my all time favorite fighter? Probably if I were to tell you who I was most excited to see you fight is probably vandelay phone. Boom. See that right hand? Russian is fucking hurt here. Yeah, he got mad. He didn't just get mad. His legs jolted. He had like you could see his legs stiffen up when he got hit by that first right hand.

Speaker 1:          16:17          He got hurt and then the second one face plant some steep. Pays a dangerous guy. He's not going to make mistakes. They Cleveland. Let's get our boy a goddamn parade. No one. When Shit. No Shit. He. Lebron. You want a jacket? Real other UFC fighters. How would you tweet out about steepen your boys from your home town. He jumped off the fence. He goes, I'm the world champ, the world champ. He was like, it was like coming into his, his, his, his mind like, is this real information? Hey Lebron. Did that just fucking game of fucking. Yeah, I love it. I love that man. I love him. I love what he stands for. I love watching him as a fighter. I love that he could do that. I love it. I love that he did it in Brazil. Look at this. Watch this. Watch how fish.

Speaker 1:          17:00          Stupid. See it's pink. Oh yeah. He just dropped it in, um, to, to be able to time it that good to look at this. Watch the timing. He pushes his hand away and then put the same hand. Did you see overeem? Overeem's tweet and crack. Yeah. Yeah. He wants to fight him. You said your neck and he did the bloodsport me see that? That one showed both that. That highlight right there was the perfect high left to the right because it showed the first one that how much impact the first one had on them. The first punch was a big factor there, man. That first punch had him. Cole. Weird up. Unbelievable man. So cool. I like that. You could still say Queer Street and you're not a homophobe queer streets. Fun. It's just strange. You know, like what, where am I at? The heavyweight division is

Speaker 2:          17:50          fun right now, man, because I don't think we're gonna see a champ. Rain for a long time.
