Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Doo doo, Doo, Doo Doo, Doo Doo. You know, just being on tinder the whole time. We're live. We're live. You can't talk about tinder dudes. She can shot it off. Don't swipe right. Steve Hofstetter. Ladies and gentlemen already ready. That was at the same time. I'm good. I'm excited to be here. I'm excited to have you, man. I'd love the video. There's a video I found out about Steve because it's a video of some fucking hecklers. Why do they still exist? The people out there. Do you not know that when you come to a comedy show, it's like going to the movies. You shouldn't try to contact ego and alcohol. You're right. That's the answer. I asked. Asked a rhetorical question and I got a definitive answer. It's a fucking great video though because you handled it so well. I don't remember the subject. What was. What was she a heckling about?

Speaker 1:          00:00:46       It was about. I was talking about how parents think they're special and they're not. That's right, and then she yelled out bullshit and then walked into two minutes of material that I already had written about the subject. If I had written what she was supposed to say, it wouldn't have been as good as what she actually said. Yeah. It was like a setup and sometimes those things happen and people accused people doing plants. I've never heard of anybody actually doing a plant though. You other than Andy Kaufman. No, like not even. Not one time, but people. Some Times people look at the world and they go, well, this is too good. It can't be real. Sleep will allow for some magic that happens sometimes. A little comedy magic. Yeah. I mean there's so many videos of hecklers. You would think that they would learn like there's.

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       Is there a video of a heckler winning? I mean, there, there are definitely videos of people who are like, I own this heckler. And then like, did you, did you looks Kinda. No, not really sometimes, but that's not the heckler winning. That's the comedian losing, right? There's, there's a difference. You know, the end there are, um, there are times I think when they're comedians, you know this, they're comedians who can't ad Lib, who are brilliant at material but are just not add libbers. If that's weird, isn't it, like the people that only want to do like monologues and if anything goes offline, like they ignore it and they just keep going and they hope that someone takes care of it. Well, I don't, I don't understand that like that. That's part of people sometimes will be like, why do you have so many heckler videos?

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       It's like, because most of them start with me going, what'd you say? Yeah. Because I don't, I don't let it go because I don't want to lose control of the crowd. I don't want other people to be like, oh well he talked, I can talk. And also I, you know, I just, I can't concentrate on this bit. I've done a thousand times. If in the back of my head I was like, wait, what's happening right now in the back of the room? Yeah. Well sometimes people just start commenting like they'll like be right in front of you too. Just crazy. Like in the front row go, no, that's not true. No, you can't say that. Don't say that. Or they even go. Yes, that's true. Like when they agree with you, it still sucks, but what about. Yeah. Then they want to put their own spin on it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       Like it's a conversation. He had a seizing sometimes, like I try to tell people, I'm like, look, comedies evocative. You're going to have a lot of thoughts and that's okay. Have the thoughts hold onto those thoughts later after the show released thoughts in the wild. But for now it's okay to think of stuff and even if you see me out in the lobby and you want to have you got a question about some of the material. Let's talk. Yeah, that's a time to talk. Absolutely not. Not why you're halfway into the setup. Yeah, it is. It's such. I mean, part of why I say it's ego is because if there's hundreds of people at this show and they're all quiet and then one person thinks they're all doing it wrong. Yeah. Like they're just sitting there and be like, wait, no, all these people are wrong there.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       We should be interacting. I need to show them. It is kind of funny that alcohol's would they serve at comedy clubs because for I guess for most people it's a good thing. For most people. Alcohol is a social lubricant relaxes you. You start laughing a little bit more, but for some people the fucking, the wheels come off and they just want to chime in and yell out, well, if you're an asshole, alcohol just makes you more of an asshole. Yeah, absolutely. So I think I've had this theory for a long time that a lot of people will blame being drunk. Oh, I was so wasted. It's like, but that's you. You were still in there. There isn't some magical like jekyll and Hyde thing that's going on. You peed on someone's truck because he wanted a p on someone's truck. Alcohol just gave you the excuse.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       There are people that are alcoholics though. We're a switch goes off. Do you know anybody like that? Um, I, I don't. You know what, but I can introduce you to a fair. I was like, I have a feeling. I know who some of the people you hang with A. I guess I don't hang out at the store and the store is the grand old opry for hecklers. Yeah, I mean it really is this. There's something about that place because there's no real dorman. Everybody's a comic. It's comics working the gate or comics working the door. Comics work in the cover booth. Comics working the room. It's the only comics. Comics work in the back parking lot. It's all Comedians, so when you're there, you're. You're under the hands of people who really don't want to be doing what they're doing. They don't really pay attention, so you have to learn how to deal with hecklers. Plus it's a hangout so that places. There's people packed in that place from 8:00 PM til 2:00 AM and everybody's hanging around drinking and so there's a lot of alcoholics and so you just get used to those dudes that have shark eyes. Their eyes glass over and they're gone. You look in there, you're like, oh, bobby's not here anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       I didn't meet people like that until I was 30. When I. When I was 30 I started to meet like real alcoholics where they'd have one drink and then they were gone. They're just off to the races. But do you think so do you think that they are a completely different person or do you think that the alcohol just allows who they are to come out? Completely speculative because I don't have that gene. Whatever that wacky gene is where you have a couple of drinks and you just go off the rails. I don't have that. I'm a happy drunk. Like when I get drunk I like to laugh and hug people. I don't. I don't understand the goal blank. Make a multicav cocktail throat at the cops wake up in jail. What the fuck? What happened? Who did what? The weirdest drunk to me is the is the crying drunk drunk.

Speaker 1:          00:06:17       That gets super upset because then it's like, why would you, why would you give yourself the ingredient that you need to cry in the corner? Like if you know, if it's the first time it ever happened, I get it. Okay. But if you're someone like, I have a friend who every time he gets drunk he gets like super sad and I was like, stop drinking. It's like, why are you drinking if you're this upset? I feel like with people like that, there's patterns that are deeply carved into their psyche from childhood. Like maybe their mom cried. A lot of their dad cried a lot and they got used to it and became a comforting pattern. But yeah, those things are. I mean people say, Oh, well what are you gonna do man? And the guy said, well, how the fuck did he get sad lives in America?

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       He's got two feet, doesn't have cancer. The fuck is he whining about there can be 100 things wrong. You're a young white person in America. We shut up. I actually don't drink anymore. I've been sober 12 years. Damn. And it was because it was really my first year on the road when I realized like, how much of a problem it could be. Oh, so you get it wrong. So you did it as a preventative measure. I did it. Yeah. It was something where I didn't go through a program and I found by the way that like people who have gone through the program or like, you know, really, you know, really sober and to me I'm just like, you needed a program, you have no willpower, you know, so it's a bit of a dichotomy there idea that someone could tell you after 12 years of sobriety that you're not really.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       This isn't even consistent. Yeah. You don't, you just choose not to drink and like, yeah, I do choose not to drink, but it's, yeah. I haven't had a drink at 12 years. It was a, it was one of these things where, I mean, you know this, it's free on the road, you know, and everybody wants. Everybody goes, Oh, let me take a shot with you afterward and be like, there are 30 of you. I'm going to die. Right. You just do the math on that and you're like, I'm going to die. And I started realizing, you know what? I don't have inhibition that alcohol changes. Like that same year I had done, I'd done some show in Bloomington, Indiana and we went to a bar afterwards and they were a bunch of hot girls dancing on the bar and I went up in a dance on the bar with them and I wasn't drunk.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       I just wanted to dance with the hot girls and there were all these like there all these drunk people you know, below the bar, like all these loser guys just kinda like nursing their beer and looking up and be like, I wish I could do that and be like, well then get the fuck up on the bar. Why? If you want to do it, do it. Can anybody just dance on the bar? Because that makes me reconsider all the Times I've touched the bar and then touched food and then. Oh yeah, my phone up there and touch that and then touched food in the bottom of my shoes are not clean Joe. Nobody's shoes are clean. How will you just allowed to. Is that, that's kind of violate health codes, right? It was a, I just figure there were enough hot girls that it was okay that I was there too. That's a good call. Like the ratio has to be. There have to be still be enough hot

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       girls. Now, did you hook up with one of those girls afterwards? Oh No, I was a pathetic, sad loser, but the point is that that I, I didn't need the alcohol to at least start the process of getting rejected. That's you. You have, you have the unique personality trait that allows you to get crazy dance on bars. Yeah. That is a strange thing though about the people that are in those 12 step programs because they really do get super attached to the idea that that's the only way to be sober. Yeah. And it's not. It is a way and if you need that. Okay. Yeah. More power to you and I, I, you know, I do not, I don't want to take that away from anybody, but we're all different and everybody's, you know, nerve endings connect differently. Whatever the hell that biology is of it.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       And I didn't need to program, especially because I would freak out if they were like, and this is about Jesus and it will be like, go fuck yourself, give me a beer. So I, you know, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be able to be comfortable there. Did you, did you ever do a program thing? Did you go to an alcoholics anonymous meeting or just stop now? I had a. So I had, there were a couple of times where I was like, alright, I need to, I need to quit and quit and that never works. And then there was one night where, so it's, it's the first real time on the road. I was terrible with women in high school and college and then suddenly I hit the road as a comic and they're everywhere and they're interested and life is different. And so there was a show.

Speaker 2:          00:10:17       I was doing the show first already. And usually the sororities that sponsor comedy shows or like the philanthropy sorority and they're all terrible. Uh, no, these girls were all hot. Just, just dimes. The whole chapter just full. They had like one ugly friend is as the charity, but they just gorgeous girls and my opener goes up and bombs and then I go up to a standing room only crowd and crush and so now it's afterward we're hanging out. There's like this after party thing that they put together for just them and the two of us, one of which they hated because he bombed and the like, they're just these eight hot girls surrounding me. One shoulder, another one out of the way to sit next to me. I was like, this is, this is like nothing I've ever experienced. And then they took us to another party and I'm pretty sure some will put something in my drink.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       Not In the way of like I want to fuck this guy in the way of like, this is a guy getting all the attention away from the other guys. And I think one of the other guys fucked with my drink. Real. Yeah. Because I got super violently ill very quickly, like very, very quickly. And I spent the whole night I was supposed to stay at the sorority house. Like the plan was. I was going to stay in the guest room so I didn't even have to do the whole excuse of like, Hey, can I use your bathroom? Can I come in for like, I just, I was supposed to go back there with them and I spent the entire night just, just vomiting. It was terrible. Spiked your drink and then I lost a Gig the next day and at the time. So my first year on the road I lost a $1,500 gig the next day.

Speaker 2:          00:11:44       Because you were so sick. I couldn't do it. I was, we were driving, it was the middle of winter, but I was wearing two pairs of pants, like two sweatshirts and in a sleeping bag in the car with the heat on full and I was shivering the whole way. Like I was fucked up so don't sure you didn't have the flu or something. That sounds like the flu. It went away like six hours later. So it could've been, it could've been a very temporary. Flew a well timed. Flew. I don't know, but that was the night where I was just like, I can't keep up

Speaker 3:          00:12:10       doing this. Have you ever heard of a drug that does that? Like a drug that makes you have the chills?

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       Man. Me, they're probably not. I might just be like, no, it doesn't sound like it. That sounds like you got something happened. Yeah, it was, uh, I, it was just very, very bad. And so I realized that it was, it was not only a chance at like a three, it was a chance that like a nine some. So you're like, all right. That was more drinking. Yeah, none of that. Wow. That's a, that's a wake up call.

Speaker 3:          00:12:39       Yeah. The world hands you four aces and you just throw up on them. What a hand of cards that you ever heard of the term dry drunk. Now what's that? Dry drunk is what people like to say. People who are alcoholics who aren't drinking but aren't in the program, are there dry drunks? And so you still have all the mental issues that are drunk has. You're just waiting to go off. You don't really have the stability that a 12 step program provides. That sounds. That sounds right. Yeah. I mean for some people for sure, but a 12 step program is weird because it doesn't require belief in a higher power.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       It does. They. There's a lot of God stuff in there and like I believe that there was something, but that something could be a life force. It could be an energy. I don't know what, but I believe it's very possible. There's something. Yeah, I don't. I don't believe that there's A. I don't believe that there's a bearded man and wings and all that bullshit. Be Dope. There was though. It wasn't that if you got up to heaven, he realized that it was all true and you'll be amazing. That's so crazy. I was just a marketing thing. I just listened to a radio lab the other day about addiction and they said that 95 or sorry I'm gonna start that over of 100 people. If they started at a aaa on January first as of December 30, first of that year, only five would still be in the program. Basically saying like, it doesn't work, but there's a lot of factors that could be at that could mean that or why that could happen because some people could start a different program, they can go to the meeting next door, but they're saying like only five percent of people will stay in the program three years through some certain statistics. That's a shit retention, right? Yeah, but that was a that that radiolab goes into this, a pill that can cure addiction. I think.

Speaker 3:          00:14:37       Well, they've had an Ibogaine forever. I began as, I don't know, it's a drug that it's from the Boga plant and it's supposed to be fantastic for people that have heroin addiction, alcohol addiction, even addictive personality disorders problems, things

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       along those lines. It's supposedly this ruthlessly introspective psychedelic experience that brutally breaks down your pathways. You're thinking pathways and shows you why you keep going into this self sabotage mode and it's apparently unbelievably uncomfortable to go through. Psychologically, physically it's not. It doesn't feel good, but when it's over, the rate of retention of the retention of sobriety, that rate of sobriety that people retain afterwards is staggering. It's like in the eighties, the high, 80 percent better than anything. Ruthlessly introspective. It sounds like a great name of a comedy album does, right? Yeah. The, there's a, there's a treatment center on the one on one, like that [inaudible] I passed by and it like, it looked like a college campus almost and I was like, what the hell is that? And I looked it up and there's like a, it's like a treatment center, like an inpatient and you like cut out everyone in your life kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       It's one of those, it's one of those like, yeah, it's one of those like, you know, you're not allowed to talk to people for six months. But when I looked it up, I found that on Google and there were reviews and one of the reviews was if someone who is about to go into the treatment center and he gave it one star, like he was reviewing his own life, like he was that mess. He like reviewed. He's like, well I'm about to take the journey. The first step of the journey of sobriety. And it was one star and I was like, I think you may have misunderstood how this rating system works, buddy. It might be a dick. Yeah. Give something one star if you haven't even tried it. I love when you ever just read yelp reviews too. Unfortunately. I love mad at myself.

Speaker 1:          00:16:27       I know. But I love when you learn more about the person and the restaurant. Yeah, of course. Yeah. There was one I saw in New York where, uh, this girl, like she opens the review like, so I, I'm back dating again and I'm like, that's not telling me how the pasta is. Yeah. Like I don't, I don't need to know that. But she uses it or has her own blog. It was fascinating though because then you get to know, should I listen to this moron? Let me, let me see what they have to say about David. Why is it that men these days don't want to open up a car door, don't want open up a door for a lady. Get upset when you're expected to pay and don't understand that you do want your own career. And like, and as it turns out that Niki was fantastic. Yeah. You're just annoying. Yeah. There's a lot of those. I always go to someone's bad review. I always go to their page and see what they think about other stuff. Yeah. Just so you can figure out. It's also tough, like using yelp sometimes in the middle of nowhere. That's really tough because then you're like, these motherfuckers don't know Sushi. Like what do they, what do they know? Sushi in South Dakota. Yeah, exactly. Fishman. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:17:30       Yeah. Yelp is tricky because it's like youtube reviews and lots of other things. You're relying on random people you don't like. Like if I call you up and I go, Hey Steve, what do you think about this? Well, I know Steve's an intelligent guy. He's going to give me a really nuanced thought out opinion of whatever we're discussing. But if you don't know a person,

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       you just reading their type, their type could be. I mean, when they write, write things down there, the printed word could be just as valid as some fucking psychopaths printed word mean you don't. You really don't know. You don't. You got to go deep, deep, deep into their, their paragraphs and you get to really try to decipher like, how fucking nuts is this person? I have a theory. I have a theory that the way we make online tolerable that way we make like, you know, online not be this, you know, just I guess Bastian for angry thought is everyone's not name, but everyone's job shouldn't be in parenthesis, so we know what people do for a living. That would help in like how many stars your coworkers give. You usually get your, you get yelled at before you're allowed to yelp. You know that guy with one star.

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       I bet he gives out a half a star. I bet it all the people who work with him, they give him a half a star and he puts one star in for the, the drug review place and get one star for his mom. For Dope Mom. There was an app that came out that was like a yelp for people and everyone got really upset. What was he yelled for? Dating. It was. Oh, so it wasn't just okay because it was people you've dated because I thought I thought the idea because it was, you know, the reviews of people and people getting upset and I was like, the only people who would get upset at that are the people who know they're going to get two stars. Well, it's people can just stock, you know, someone who's like a Shitty coworker who had, that's true, has it against you can write a bunch of mean shit about you and then every time you pull up your name, you see this means shit written against you.

Speaker 3:          00:19:28       Yet you need to, I think for the way that to work for the way for that to work as you can only review someone if you both agree to review each other. I was reading this thing about this guy who's getting stalked online, but this other guy and uh, they found the person and it was a 17 year old kid that was the son of one of his friends and had no real beef with them. But it was just doing it for sport just for the fun of it. Because he knew he could fuck with the guy and scare him and he did all this Holocaust Jews stuff and all this antisemitic stuff is really, really crazy stuff like sent ashes to their house and left ashes at their front door. Like a, just a total psychopath, a kid, 17 year old kid and it apparently had haunted this guy for a long time and he was trying to figure out who it was.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       Then he hired someone that's pretty easy to find people. Once you hire someone who's an expert, they found the kid like instantly and they realized it was this fucking high school kid that was the son of one of his friends and they all had a sit down and he. They printed up all the stuff that this kid had written for like a fucking year and handed it to him and the kid started crying and I don't know why I did it. And I got addicted to it. I couldn't stop and like addicted to it. Well now you're playing a game. Know, and if you're not there when the person is reacting, especially when you're and your emotions, maybe they're not so complex or they're not so rather formed and not, they're not mature. Maybe completely aware that every action has a reaction on the other end whether you see it or not,

Speaker 2:          00:21:01       there is a, uh, you know, that movie though the button or whatever it was where like someone like press a button and someone would die in the world. I heard about that. I never saw it. I didn't either, but there was, I think it was an snl sketch about it where they were like, they explain the whole premise or like you press this button in somewhere, someone the world die and the guy just hits the button and they're like, we didn't let us finish. Like we would give you a million dollars and he just hits it again because we're, we're that like inhuman, impersonal. Like if you just tell me that someone somewhere else in the world died, like that doesn't really affect you. Yeah. There's too many people anyway. Yeah. Hit the button. Let's clear up the four. Oh, five. Yeah, I guess it just depends on who. Yeah, so if you don't feel it, it feels like

Speaker 3:          00:21:46       problem with drones, right? Yeah. I mean they say that drone pilots, what is this? Oh, is that the, the. They say that a drone pilots suffer through a lot of severe anxiety when they're done and like it, it's apparently incredibly psychologically stressful because you're doing this weird thing where you sort of sending this robot and they're doing it from Nevada. Right? So the robots are in Afghanistan or Pakistan or Yemen or wherever the hell they are and they're launching missiles from the sky robots and it just feels so detached and creepy to the people that are doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       Well, it's the same, I guess the same psychology of like why you're able to get into such credit card debt, but you wouldn't do that with cash because like you were, you, you see it as just some mythical thing and then afterward you realize, oh, this is real life. You would you be able to, would you be able to kill someone if you knew that they were like a bad guy? Yeah. And would you feel bad about it? No, that's what I think too. Yeah. I don't think I would. I mean if someone like Hitler character. Yeah. I don't think that doesn't necessarily have to be quite that bad, but I mean you really went to the end of the scale immediately. That's how extreme it was. Yeah. I was going for like, you know, just the idea of like someone is going to kill someone that you care about and you killed that person. Yeah. Because there are all these. Like there's this trope in movies and tv about, you know, like a cop shot, someone that they had to shoot in the line of duty. It wasn't, you know, like just killing some kid. It was, you know, shooting a bad guy and then they have to go to therapy over it. I feel like. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:23:27       No. Have you ever talked to soldiers about that? I haven't. The real ptsd with soldiers is things they can't control. That's what really fucks with them. Like worried about being attacked, worried about being blown up, worried about driving over an ied. The soldiers that are proactive, like Rangers, Navy Seals, guys go in and hunt people down. They don't have that much ptsd, PTSD. There are different types of people. I mean, some of them have just been through crazy firefights and they wake up with horrible nightmares, but a shocking amount of them realize they're doing the right thing. They have to do this, this needs to be done. And they're the man to do it. Yeah. And they're trained for it. This is their job and they're all together and they like a family. It's a feel more superhero ask. Yeah. So when you see like a guy, a cop and a movie that feels bad that he had a shoot, a bad guy.

Speaker 3:          00:24:19       That's like the writer, that's the writer. If the writer was a cop. Yeah. Or maybe a cop that maybe shouldn't be a cop. She was definitely some of those out there. Or a writer who shouldn't be a writer or. Right. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean those movies, like how many of these movies have like these, like we're talking about the grooves that are carved in that uh, some people have that get depressed very easily or behave really like really a sad really easily. Like those deals, grooves, those psychic grooves that they think that they're supposed to behave like that. Those are carved into tropes and storylines and plots. And there's so many plots, there's so many movies you watch, like you didn't even write this. Okay. You knew what has already been written about these subjects and you just sort of repeated it with different words. Yeah. Like this isn't really a story you wrote because this story has happened the fucking million times in movies.

Speaker 2:          00:25:14       Well, and it causes those stories existing then cause people to act like that. Yes. Like we. Yeah. One of the most fascinating interviews I ever saw was, you know, they interviewed the guy who was, you know, all the gangster movies in the forties that say ha, saying like all that. And they said, how did you get the accent so perfect. And he said, I made that accent up and then all the gangsters wanted to be like the gangsters in the movies. And so then all the gangsters started talking like that because of that, because of those movies. James Cagney. Yeah. Wow. Like that was, they just told the act like they just started doing it. Life Imitates Art, right? Yeah. And then it's, you know, it's a. and then people feel like, oh, well this is normal because that's what we're shown on television.

Speaker 3:          00:25:59       Well that was the argument against Gangsta rap that the argument was that they were forcing kids by, you know, making this music really popular. They're are forcing kids to accept this type of behavior as being normal and even exemplary, like exemplary of a bad motherfucker. You're shooting people and you ever go back and listen to like the old Nwa.

Speaker 2:          00:26:22       Oh yeah. I actually grew up. So I grew up in Queens, New York and I was big fan of old school hip hop now. I didn't like, I was never big into the Nwa stuff. I preferred, you know, the, I preferred the lyrics about how great we are at rapping, not how many bitches we've killed, but that was the, that's kind of the line in the sand. But who are your people? Who would you like a tribe called quest? I was, so when five died.

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       I'm tribe guys are awesome. Black sheep. I'm a, I loved a Pete Rock and cl smooth. We a de la soul guy too. Yeah, just, it was great. I got to when I was 21, I think I covered. I was in college during the Seinfeld sendoff party and the place where, uh, like the Tom's diner where monks was based, the exterior shot was like a block off my campus. So I made up a fake press pass and I went and I covered the party and I got to meet del Sol was there and it was like, it was so great. That's nice. Yeah. You know, it was a sad time for me, man. When Mc search got his own daytime talk show, I'm like, God, third base I used to love third base. The end of goes the weasel visa goes pistor gracile my eyes. Someone hit my eye, but if you watched the MC search, a daytime talk show you like, this can't be real.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       He's punking us. Yeah. This is a character he's playing. He's doing that Joaquin Phoenix thing that Joaquin Phoenix did for a year. It's that. It's that same sort of thing. When all of a sudden all the adults were talking about the facebook and I'm like, well, facebook's done now. Right? You know, this isn't going to be fun anymore. It's MC search is done because he had the most pre postures, daytime talk show. Did you ever watch it? I know I knew about it, but I never watched it. Oh, it was such and you know, I mean, he's like, I'm a dead now, but it was like play the beginning of it because the beginning of the show, see if he could find it because the beginning of it is so fucking preposterous when he explains how we're gonna. Keep it real. We're keeping it real. Oh, there's no such thing as that.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       Like when people say we're keeping it real, that means they're just. They have no other words that they can think of. It's madness. It's just, it's, it's a dangerous way of talking. I was at a, a I, I did a bunch of extra work when I started out and which, that's so much fun. That's, Oh my God. Extra work is the best because you get to see just the worst in humanity right in front of you with the extras. They're absolute just batch it. And there was a woman, right? Oh, extrusion. Between going back and forth from extra work to open mics. And that was my, that was my day. I would just go, just go, just watch, just watch people desperately need attention and do nothing of quality to get it. So there was this one woman, they put out the craft services and this one woman goes up and she loads up like two plates and then putting stuff in her purse also.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       And I just, she catches me looking at her and she just goes, I'm just keeping it real. And I go, well, if you want to know what's real, they're going to refill this table later so you can just come get seconds if you don't have product one and food to take home though. Well in the purse, I understand. But just the idea of it was just, it was like the start of like a 14 hour day just keeping it real. I'm like, that's not keeping it real. Just say like, Hey, I'm really poor and I'm right now

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       keeping it real with me. Dude. Yeah. The also that. But you know, it was something to stare at. It was very weird. That's a minor infraction. You think about the world or holsters and open mic and the paid furniture world. That's one of the. Keeping it real things about the comedy store. You're constantly around crazy. People Open Michart especially, they're always hanging around, you know, because it's Kinda like a hangout on top of being a club. What's the craziest Shit you've seen? Oh God. I mean open mics or madness. I mean there's [inaudible]. Anybody can get onstage and a lot of times that's one of the things about standup is that a lot of people don't see themselves that way. Other people see them. Yeah, and that gets exposed when you get onstage because you realize, oh, this is how people see me. People see me as being an obnoxious, really annoying person that thinks they're funny.

Speaker 3:          00:30:32       I see myself as being this really funny person and then they have to work that out over the. I mean it's almost like a self improvement course on communication skills because you are brutally reminded of how poor your communication skills are when you don't get the laughs and you're like, God, what is wrong with my thoughts? This is my thought. How about my friends think it's funny, like what is it that's the only someone who knows what's going on, right? The crazy people are the ones that go, this card doesn't get me. It was cropped sucks. Yeah. It's called bullshit. I mean, how many times have we heard that? Just like every crowd I've ever played to, they all suck. None of them understand bro, but the worst thing that can happen, one of those people is some one day they'll just catch that magic wave where you know there's this one crowd where almost anyone can do well.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       Yes, there's these weird crowds that are just so good and so hyped up at some with really shitty skills can get up there and just make it happen and they chased the ghosts of that performance forever. Here's a great story that I've told before. Unfortunately for people have heard it, but Joey Diaz was the early days of the compressor. There was one woman who is insane. I mean completely insane. It just. There was nothing remotely funny, but anything she ever had to say, she was brutal and she would go up and every time she would go up, everybody would have to get out of the room. It was just like, what? What is happening here? How is she, how does she even get spots? It was during the nineties when it was easier to get spots and so Joey Diaz goes backstage behind the curtain and he goes backstage and takes his pants off and every time she hits a punchline he opens up the curtain and chose the crowd. His balls, she's got no pants on, so every time she hits the punchlines, he's doing this and she's killing. I mean killing. And you see that confident look in her face. She has no idea what's in the stride or swagger and she hits those St punchlines and all of a sudden Joe, he comes out with his balls and everybody's crying, laughing and she, she never knew. She never knew. She had no idea. No one ever told her. I don't think so. If they did, she would never believed

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       it. Bull Shit. I was Carolyn like she was just insane. I tell. I tell young comics that you don't, you don't exist in the world. How you see yourself, you exist in the world as the sum total of how everyone else sees you. That's, that's who you are and that's true on stage. Also, you exist on that stage as the sum total of how the crowd sees you, right? Your actions, your what you wear, how you stand, how you speak. Those can all determine that, but your thoughts of how you want to be seen, the difference of how you see yourself and how everyone else sees you, that chasm is delusion and so the shorter that chasm, the more self aware you're going to be, the funnier you can be. The bigger that chasm, the more likely you're going to flip a table on a reality show. Yes, and that's the difference.

Speaker 3:          00:33:27       Very good point. That's a very good, very good way of putting it and it goes back to what we were talking about earlier that stand up in a lot of ways is almost like a vehicle for introspective observation. Like you're. You're almost forced to examine yourself in a way that very few people do because people like to put a blinders and that's why people like to drink. You just got to push it all away and ignore all the faults and press on and when you're doing standup, I mean you really. You can't do that because bombing is so unbelievably, brutally painful that you, you go, okay. That can't happen again.

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       If you know you bomb though. Like I try. So the, when I was first living out here, uh, I would hang out at the, there were shows at Westwood Brewco all the time. I don't know if you ever did those Adam Hunter shows? No, no, no, no. Adam prairie. Well they were a, so I would hang out there all the time and there was one night where a bunch of comics had done a show in Long Beach on the Queen Mary and one by one they were all getting to Westwood and every one of them. Man, that show is terrible. The Queen Mary's a boat by the way for. Yeah. Oh yeah, no. Yeah. I guess if people are unfamiliar and be like, they all performed on this one lady and she's a Queen Queen of. Well it's on the, it's not even like in a bar called the Queen Mary. It's on the Queen Mary or what are they talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       Yeah, they just standing on this lady named Mary. And so one by one they would all show up and they'd be like, there were like 12 people there and it was a nightmare and everyone is talking about how shitty it was and how everybody bombed and the night was terrible. Then one comment gets there and doesn't know that everyone had already done that. And the first thing he does, he had just got back from Long Beach. Man, I crushed that. That was such a great show. Everybody was going nuts and just going on and on about how great it was. And the rest of us are just being like, Oh, you've never killed. Because if you think that that was killing, you've never killed. You've never had a good show. If you don't understand what that feels like or you just lie and tell everybody all the time. You have good shows, but it's terrible delusion. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:35:21       They made me just doesn't understand himself, you know? I mean, how many guys have you met like that, that like or that amount around girls or around a job opportunity around. It's true. They think that they're way more qualified for something. There are like, I'm going to go get this flight's president job, Bro. I'm gonna. Go get it. I'm going to

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       run. And there's a lot of people are just completely crazy. Well, there's the eye. I like to tell people, you know, follow your dreams and your dreams are stupid because it's good advice if you like. If you quit your job to work at American, like to audition for American idol and you've never ever been paid to sing anywhere, you're a fucking idiot. Well, American handles are really good example because if you watched that show, the best part about that show is the beginning where you're just watching mental illness. They should call it a mental illness. Our slash a shreds of talent. Yeah. Now because American illness, for every one person that you get that gets through the entire, like who's like the big name stars that have gone through American, I'll carry on those. Those two are huge and there's the guy who went a little crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:36:28       The young country music, gay guy. Akin. Yeah. What happened to him? I was actually in his true Hollywood story. I'm glad you said True Hollywood story because if you said house the other night. No, I was in a. He was the guy who got me violently ill. I know clay aiken drugged me. I was A. I was making fun of him to a producer on the show. Oh boy. Like she just told me that she was working on that show and I was just like, what? He was a friend of mine was like, what are you up to? Just telling me she's working on the show. And she goes, yeah, you know, we were doing research on. He used to be acquired boy. And I just go, oh. So he started out with hymns and never quite made it to hers. And then she just goes, you want to be on the show?

Speaker 1:          00:37:04       I was like, what? So then that line actually got cut by the lawyers. Yeah. I had a, I had five jokes that were in the script and three of the five of them got cut by the lawyers. Fucking lawyers, man. That's why lawyers, you can't have podcasts. No, you can't. You're not allowed. You fucks like a lawyer podcast. They can't come on them, they can't. You can't have a lawyer telling you what you can and can't say about podcasts. You just, you know, loud because it's. This is the last place is the last bastion of free speech as far as like just expressing yourself in conversation. There's no. This is the only one left there. Easily trick though. I used to be. I used to be a segment producer on a show and we would always put in stuff we didn't want to use so that they could come in the room and be like, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       You have to take that out, take that out and then leave in the thing that we thought they would take out. Well, I'm sure you've seen the scene in team America, world police, they the sex scene between the two puppets, they made like 10 minutes longer than they wanted it to be where he shits on her chest or she shits on his chest. They pee on each side on both. They went nuts and the reason why they did it, it was because they could cut some of it. It would still be preposterous. Which it wound up being. Yeah, but that, that's a common strategy that we did that in the nineties with news radio, we had an episode of news radio where Phil Hartman said Penis on the air on the radio show, and then it was through the episode. He said Penis like 20 times and they, uh, they were like, you can't say penis more than eight times. And it was like eight times.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       Who makes that it's fucking assholes. Assholes, assholes who decide what America is willing to tolerate. Crazy rebel bro. I think it was four times, but they, uh, they didn't air it so it didn't air. It seems that at all. No, it had an air in like season two or three, like whatever season it was. Maybe it was season two. I don't remember what season it was, but it, it had an air leg the next season or the season later. And like we were told, hey, the penis episodes Aaron tonight. We were all like, what? It's still never heard. I never heard. I love so much that there's something called the penis episode, by the way. Good, bad name the penis episodes. Yeah, that's good. Bad name. That would totally play at the whiskey. Yeah, like a fucking punk band. The Penis Penis episode. Yeah. It's part of the patriarchy.

Speaker 2:          00:39:25       Yeah. Uh, yeah. I, I think that, uh, I, I used to call it a march of the penguins because all the suits would come down the hallway and tried to ruin our art. Uh, but the idea that someone goes, well, it says specifically eight times, you can say penis. It's so hard

Speaker 3:          00:39:40       retread. It's totally arbitrary and there's no rules anywhere. What happens on the nighttime, like beetle juice comes out or penis choose comes seat. Satan comes through the floor. There's a way to, uh, to do art. And it's definitely not by having a bunch of people that have money invested in it, looking at it going, okay, how can we maximize this? How can we make this as sellable as possible? That's just the opposite of the kind of mentality that you need to make something good. And if it just like you were talking about with comedy or people don't see themselves, if you don't see yourself, how other people see it's not going to work and it won't be funny. Well that's kind of the same thing with art. If you produce a television show or a whatever it is and people don't enjoy it while it won't go anywhere, it'll fall off and then it's not good anymore. But to have someone come in and say, Oh, you got to do this and you got to do that because we know better because we're the ones with the money that never works.

Speaker 2:          00:40:36       But every time, every time I think that I remember that according to Jim had over

Speaker 3:          00:40:40       100 episodes, over a hundred episodes, but that's. There's a, there's a style of comedy. It had over a hundred episodes. I remember Jag, Jag was online, I was on news radio and we were always like, what in the fuck is going on? How is that a real show? If you've ever watched that show? Nobody watched that show. And the people that did watch that show, it's like they were sedated. It's like it's a hum and under which like subliminal messages were played in the background about Bush being a great president or something, like it didn't make any vulcans and it didn't make any sense that it stayed on the air.

Speaker 2:          00:41:12       You watch any of the CSS or any of those are the know the one I'm thinking of Ntis. So I, I saw an episode the other day I get transfixed with bad television. Like I never put it on purpose, but if like someone, if I'm like in a hotel room or something when I flip it on or whatever it is, like it takes me a little to just shake it off because I just want to be like, how is this mate? How is this possible? You know? And so I was watching it and I was thinking like the comedy in it was so bad. Like the jokes were so terrible that I almost wondered, you know, they hire people for punch up. Do they hire people for punch down? Like do they hire people to be like water down these good job?

Speaker 3:          00:41:49       Well that's the chuck Lorre Guy. He knows how to do them. He knows how to do that drone that, that one style of comedy, like two and a half men. Yeah, he did a bunch of the white noise machine. He just does those things. I know that for people that are all just like exhausted from eating carbs and sugar all day and they just sitting in the couch of some melting. Then the dumbest fucking humor plays out in front of them and it's just enough to keep them paying attention. So they watched those Toyota commercials.

Speaker 2:          00:42:21       I, I was, you know, very often I wonder about like how does this get made? How is this, why does anybody like this, et cetera. And I was at some truck stop in the middle of nowhere, just getting gas and getting food and there's a tier of the TV playing. It was like a little lunch counter and there's a TV playing and as a commercial and there's this guy running around. It's for blinds, but this guy is running around. He like tries to open those blinds, Kinda has nothing to do with it. And then he runs outside and you get stung by a bunch of stung by a bunch of bs and he's like fighting them off. And I'm sitting there thinking like, oh, what the fuck? Who the fuck would do? I can write commercials like, who would do that? And there's a dude sitting next to me just going,

Speaker 3:          00:43:01       he's, he can't get away from the bees like just out loud to know what to know. One just like he's all over it. They're all over the zoo. It's for, oh, it was at my friend's house once and her friend and her mom was over and uh, they were watching like some spiderman movie and Spiderman got bit by a spider and she just goes, he got bit by a spider will never, I'll never forget that. Never forget to go. He got bit by a spider like I gotta get Outta here. Just one of these things the rest of us didn't see. There's just something about like, man, I just think just like you can buy a prius or you could buy a shelby gt, 500, you know, one one has 100 horsepower, one has 500 horsepower. Brains are like that too. They just have to be.

Speaker 3:          00:43:52       There's just no doubt about it. And there's a lot of those little prius brains out there, man. And if you put on a show for Prius brains, you will attract them like, like metal to a magnet. Just find it. Those, those, the duck dynasty shows you ever watch duck dynasty? I have thankfully not even seen a clinic. Shit. Fucking watch it for sure. Just to understand that there's people like that out there that look forward to it. I got to Dvr. I said, you know, I heard what today they're going to do. Shoot some ducks. She won't use them. Duck duck show, duck. And they shoot it. They don't even shoot it. Hardly. Shoot ducks show is more about like horrible people hanging out doing really boring

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       shit and locked. They're all down home. They're down home their country. That's why. That's why the people who like when the people say like, Oh, you know, I voted for Bush because I can, you know, he reminded me of me and I'm just like, when you're a fucking asshole. Also, like, you're also like to think you reminded them of them. Yeah. Yeah. It was your dad a multimillionaire and did you grow up in Maine and pretend you from Texas? Like what about him? What about the fact that your dad was your dad in the CIA to where you see that you see that with trump now where people are like, oh, he reminds me of me and I'm just like, he the furthest thing from you? He's the, he's the. I grew up in New York City and so like I remember I was a kid when it happened, but I remember the central park jogger when trump took out for full page ads in different newspapers calling for the death penalty for these black kids who didn't even do it and he was just inciting a riot.

Speaker 1:          00:45:25       Basically. He was just trying to race bait and get attention and that's the guy I remember. No, I don't relate to that guy. Yeah, he's a real tough guy to relate to. I don't think people really do relate to them. I think what they relate to is the possibility that he may win and they like to be on the camp of a winner. So like a football team that they can get behind. They don't really give a shit about the players. They just decide we're going to win. We're fucking winning. We're winning. We're trump trump's winning. But the trump winning all those dickheads. Yeah, they. But they also say the things like, you know, like he speaks like I do, like that's, I don't want a president who speaks like, and I do feel fairly intelligent guy. I want my president to be wasting harder than me.

Speaker 1:          00:46:06       I would like a really articulate Obama type guy, but that didn't work out. Yeah. Had the Obama type guy was like, what we were hoping for. Like when, when Bush was in office, Obama was like, the fucking recipe man. We want a black guy who's super articulate, really intelligent and well, we're kind of relax. Everybody would always race bullshit. Look, clearly, it has nothing to do with race, it's about culture and circumstances and where are you growing up? Look at this guy. He's black. He's smarter than all of us were. Good luck. He's liberal. He's going to fix everything. He's going to relax everybody. He doesn't want to. Guantanamo Bay wants to get us out of Iraq. We made it through this Bush thing. We didn't. Civilization collapsed and then he's an office in his own. It was kind of the same shit. He talks better.

Speaker 1:          00:46:49       Yeah, that's kind of the same shit is going on. I think the biggest problem is that he's too reasonable, like he's too reasonable and the people who disagree with him or being completely unreasonable and you can't just be like, well, let's look at both sides. If one side is being a Dick, you don't look at. It's like CNN will do that. Where they're like, well, let's present both sides of this argument. Here's one person against pedophilia, so let's talk to someone who's for pedophilia. And it's like, no, don't give that guy airtime. Right. Don't ever talk to that guy. Yeah. So. So the people who you know, who want to take rights away and who want to convince poor people to vote against their own best interests, like you don't give them equal time, but they do well. The problem is you're dealing with right

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       and left and then again, people get really tribal. Yeah. When they're on a team, they get super tribal, like I told, told us before. But it's always struck me as being really bizarre. I was with a buddy of mine is a writer and he was talking about the election. He's like, we have to win in Idaho if we went in Idaho or Iowa. We went in Iowa, we got it wrapped up. I was like, what is this? We, I guess as we shit, it's like the Democrats. So I'm like, okay, you're on a team, right? You're on a team, you're fucking. This is the mariners, this is the marriage versus the raiders. You've got your, you've got this weird team mentality. And I think that's entirely one of the things that is real comfortable for people to fall into when it comes to elections. And it's one of the reasons why I think we need way more parties, at least at least that way we'll have more teams because this one is two team option is like if every fucking year it was a celtics versus the Lakers in the NBA finals game, wouldn't you be tired of that after awhile?

Speaker 3:          00:48:28       Well that's I think how America feels about the election. That's why the ratings are down. That's why people aren't really paying attention that much. That's why people are so frustrated by the choices. Like you can't be kind of just two choices.

Speaker 2:          00:48:39       Well I used to be, you know, very politically minded and, and active. And I used to do a lot of like everybody should go out and vote and then I talked to more and more people and then I'm just like, not everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       Yeah. Well it would be nice if we didn't have a representative government. Yeah, it would be nice. First of all, if you didn't have like one like super delegates, what is that? What do you mean you don't have to vote for the people that you're Stateville

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       superdelegates were basically to keep Jesse Jackson out of office. Like that's, that's how they started. Really? Yeah. When Jesse Jackson was starting to get some heat and I think it was 1980, uh, suddenly there was 80 or 84, I forget, but it was a suddenly superdelegates came out, but good job. Super d'elegance kept that fucking demon out of the White House. Not only super delegates though, but even the delegates of the electoral college, they don't have to vote the way their constituents do. In fact, there was a time when one of them, I think it was in Minnesota, accidentally wrote down the name of the vice president in both slots for president, vice president. So his vote didn't count and that was like 30,000 people that he was representing.

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       Whoa.

Speaker 2:          00:49:46       And just because he was a fucking idiot. And like you, you can actually, if you're now obviously people wouldn't do it for the most part because you'd think, oh well then they lose the ability to do it and that's all the little power they have in their life is to be a delegate at this convention. But the fact of the matter is that like New York state can vote 100 percent for a Democrat and then the electoral college can go and just vote for Republican. It can just, they can do it if they want to or vote for a Democrat, they can write someone in if they want to.

Speaker 3:          00:50:13       It's a ridiculous idea that was conceived back when you were in. You couldn't communicate with people easily. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       It was that simple. It was the point of it was that like not everyone was qualified to vote because you didn't hear things. Yes. And so they would be like, well, here's the representative government.

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       They'll, you know, learn from what their people want. And then they'll take that over there. And it was a wonderful idea. And now it's bullshit. Yeah, it's ridiculous. And it's time has gone. I mean, we, if we, this is the point that I always bring up, if we didn't have a system of government in place, we had all these people. We all just woke up today who would say we need one person to run it. No one who would say that we need one person to be representative of the state because the people can't tell everybody know, will you have an email now? We have twitter, we have facebook, we have poles, we have. There's ways to find out what people want and people don't want to. Representative government in 2016 is like writing with feathers. It's like some old stupid shit that we don't need anymore.

Speaker 3:          00:51:07       We should make them right with feathers. Who should make them wear powdered wigs to those fucks. Yeah. Feel like you want this office while it comes with a couple of things. I mean if you want to be like one of those people, you should dress like one of those people that invented it. Then there'd be no hillary email scandal because it would just be like maybe she wrote on the wrong kind of parchment. Yeah, she wrote on the actual animal skins and said, we don't do that anymore. Hillary, you're doing old school. She's doing old school with her non encrypted email, right? Yeah. Have you talked about, I assume you've talked about the gorilla already. Yeah, we kind of talked about it a little. Did we think we did? Yeah. That's fucked up. Yeah, it's fucked up for the zoo. The zoo fucked up. You shouldn't make it so God damn easy to get in the gorilla tank.

Speaker 3:          00:51:47       Yeah, it. So on this one, I don't know exactly what happened on this one cause I'm, I'm trying to kind of block it out. I saw the whole thing so that the kid kid fell in. Was it, was it like a kid falling in where the parent was at fault or was it a kid doing something they shouldn't have done? Well, the kid was doing something and shouldn't have done, but the parents weren't watching the kid. Yeah. Look, the zoo made it way too easy to get into the grill and closure. The kid got through the fence, fell down into this water. The gorilla came in and scooped up. The kid arguably saved the kid but was handling it in a way that it could handle a gorilla baby, but a human baby, you just ripped the arms off the kid. He could really, really hurt it and I just don't think a gorilla is even aware of how fragile a three year old human being is as opposed to.

Speaker 3:          00:52:35       Have you ever had a three year old champ or three year old girl in near you? A. I can't say I've ever had that experience. I was on a TV show. It was on his radio and they brought in a champ for a scene in this two year old chimp with a diaper on was like I was holding it and it was was beating on me. It was like hit me in the back, like playing around with me. They're unbelievably strong and sinewy like a little tiny bodybuilder. Like they don't feel like a baby. Like I have little kids and when you pick up a little kid, they're all soft and they feel like little kids, they're, they're mushy. This just champ was not mushy and I think this gorilla probably had no idea how to handle a baby softly, you know, probably our toddler really didn't, didn't know. And they panicked and then they shot the gorilla. But it seems to me that there's gotta be a better way to do that. But I could see the parents being, fuck that gorilla,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       shoot it, shoot it. I want my kid back. Yeah. But I could see the gorilla being like, fuck those parents. Yeah. But I like people more than I like gorillas. I do. And I love your joke about team people. You know, it's, it's. I mean it's a, it's a bit I, I enjoy, but there was a there. So there was a bit I used to do. There was a store in Chicago like 15 years ago where a woman was holding her baby over gorilla pit. Oh yeah. I remember that. Like holding it straight up and then drop the baby and on that one the gorilla saved the kid and picked it up and, and kept until the zookeeper could give it back to the mother. And the joke I used to do is be like, I'm sorry, give it back. Like at that point, a gorilla is a better parent than the person who wants you voluntarily dangle your baby over a wild animal. It's death you giving of the baby away. Well, we've even made it

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       way too easy for people to survive. People survived very little adversity. We survive with. It's easy access to food, easy access to employment. If you get fired, you get to sue. If you're incompetent completely, you can claim that you were harassed at work. There's so many loopholes and it's so. We're so nerfed. Every sharp edge is covered with foam and everyone's wearing a helmet. The nerfing of America, and this is what we got left. We've got these fucking idiots. We've got a bunch of really dumb people that are allowed to fuck and have kids. And you can't stop people from having kids because then someone can try to stop you. Well, I don't like your belief, Steve Hofstetter. You're a crazy liberal. You think you should. I think you should be able to have a nation that's not under God and you're gonna raise your children without God. That's child abuse and then you on my show the other day, nobody shows, but you know, I just think they're human beings need a certain amount of adversity. We need a certain amount of difficulty to overcome to learn those lessons, to filter that experience down into your behavior and when you don't learn those lessons and you just live this muted, nerved up world, then you're holding your fucking baby over the gorilla tank because you getting a little thrill. Who's,

Speaker 3:          00:55:34       whoops, I'm dumb. I dropped the baby. Just like you drop your cell phone just like you drop your keys and the fucking drainage ditch. You're a dummy. You drop shit. You're a stupid fuck. And not supposed to be alive. Should have been eaten by wolves. Hundreds of years ago. The world was safe. You would have been the one who walked off the trail. I'm going to go find a better word to the council and the wolf's would have eaten you and no one would have heard from you. And that's what it's supposed to happen to those types of people. Well

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       it is Darwin. I'm a big fan. Big Fan. Big Fan. He had some good ideas. Chris bowers, I don't know if you know him. He's a comic out of. Oh, you've worked more days. So, uh, in Indianapolis. Yeah. Chris and I are two of the owners. Oh yeah. No Shit. Yeah, what a great club. That's awesome man. It's even better. We had new location now. Oh no shit. You guys moved A. Yeah, we have a balcony and everything now. It's great. It's like a, it like a small theater. Oh, that's terrific man. That was a great club. No, that was a fun one. Everybody loves that place. That's cool though. I didn't know you own that place. Yeah. Good for you. You fucking entrepreneur as well. Uh, so bowers has a great theory where, you know, the, the way to I guess, prevent the stupid people in the overpopulation is if everyone is basically sterilized and you have to take something in order to be able to be pregnant.

Speaker 1:          00:56:48       But the only way you get that pill is you have to take that pill every day. You don't take a pill to stop yourself from being pregnant. You take a pill to get yourself pregnant, so you have to take that pill. Both partners would have to take that pill every day for six months because if you can't commit to taking a pill every day for six months, you can't raise a kid. Yeah, but it's so easy for people to just do that. That's not. That's not enough of a fucking start. It should be like one of those crows have to get a crumb out of a tube and they have to use one tool to get the other tool to get the third tool. That's how it should be. It's too fucking easy. Just take a pill. You should have to do a puzzle everyday. That should give you a puzzle, and if you fail creasing difficult, you don't get a pill, so you get six months of correct answers to puzzles to get your pills.

Speaker 1:          00:57:35       That's the only way she'd be able to get your pills. I think that's how chipotle, he gave away free Burrito once on their annual anniversary. If they did it that way for people the fucking four. Oh, five would be a breeze. Yeah, it would be nobody just be a couple people waving at each other. We made it. You ever watch you ever watch like a period piece? Television where they run into people they know like, like a mad men. They would always like run into people at the restaurant that they would know and part of me is like, oh, well that's convenient. Then I'm like, no, no. There are fewer people. There were fewer people then it was. It seems. It seems possible. It's definitely possible. It was possible in the nineties when I moved here in 1994, there was half as many people. I wonder what the actual statistic was, but I'm pretty sure is half as many people like when you would get, you'd get on the highway and the traffic would be bad, but it wouldn't be that bad.

Speaker 1:          00:58:26       Would be no big deal. I remember people talking about getting from Santa Monica to the valley in 10 minutes. What exactly? Ten minutes, that's what it wanted to drive a Delorean, regular car. Just get in your car and drive. And this back when cars were slow as shit and the brakes were terrible. There was no traffic. You just get around. It's only nine miles. No problem. They just did it. It's the same as a a, you know, planes. I mean I've only been flying about 20 years but 20 years ago and now that's part of because they do the spoke garbage now where they, you know, you have to fly through Cincinnati to go to Denver or whatever it is. But it's, everything's full. Every single flight is full. Like the idea when someone doesn't have a seat next to you on if it's a Christmas party.

Speaker 1:          00:59:08       Oh yeah. Well how about when they say, we've oversold this flight, we're looking for volunteers. What do you, you're selling some shit. You don't even really have. They absolutely do that. But in fairness, we can do that with comedy clubs too because there's always a percentage of no shows. So there's, do we, do you do that at mortise? Uh, we've, we've done it, but it's not by a high percentage, it's like because usually our no show percentage will be like 10 percent, so will oversell by like five percent because people, because if you have 100 people, 10 people won't show up. It depends on the price of the ticket. It depends on the act like with, with a celebrity, no show percentages of virtually nothing. But with like a typical day, you know, at a typical, like a, we call it a just funny, someone who's good but no one has heard of them.

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       Right. You know, plenty of times some will be like, oh yeah, let's get four tickets to the club and then they only have one friend like that happens all the time. Babysitter canceled. That's true. You know, it's too rainy out. Someone doesn't want to go. There are a ton, tons of reasons, but you can't fuck over the people that actually paid and actually showed up. Never once, not one time that you have extra chairs, you can just shove them in places in case everybody shows up if we have to. But what happens is on the ticket it very specifically says like, this is good until showtime. Oh, okay. And so what happens is, even if there is, even if the no show rate is way less than it is, even if there's weird anomaly where the no show rate is like zero, there are still people who come late and you can't come late.

Speaker 1:          01:00:35       Yeah. If you come late, like you might get turned away. And we tell everyone that even if you have a ticket, we tell everyone that if you come late you can get turned away. What if you get stuck in drama? Well, you can call. You can call and say, hey, you know, we're on our way and please hold a seat that seems reasonable. But like that thing about it this way with Broadway, with Broadway, the doors close. Okay? First of all, fuck Broadway, all that nonsense. Fuck musicals and fuck plays. Okay, we have movies now. I want special effects. I don't want you talking loud. I'm with you. I want you miked up. I want you to be able to whisper and I want to hear it crystal clear and I'm giving you no leeway. I'm giving you no leeway because the costumes are nice.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       Yes. I won't plan. I want writing. I want to fucking. I want new shit to want some old shit that doesn't apply anymore. I'm okay with musicals. I don't, you know, I can just suspend my disbelief and go. Okay. Everybody's singing fine. I mean, but it's got to be a good song. It's got a further the plot. It can't just be something that they know is going to sell. Well, yeah. I went to a musical. Well I should take that back because the book of Mormon is fucking amazing. Yes. That's a musical. That's what I mean. But those guys are just, they do everything right. They just do everything right. But that was also Bobby Lopez who did avenue Q. I don't know who that is. I don't know what that is. Do you don't know avenue q? Nope. So avenue q is the other good Broadway show in of the two.

Speaker 1:          01:01:54       Uh, avenue q was the one where the, they had songs, uh, the Internet is for porn and everyone's a little bit racist. Oh, okay. It's cool. So it's a good study. Long as it's common puppets. Yeah, it was with puppets. It was like a Broadway show with puppets, like sesame street on Broadway. Hey, whatever happened to the fucking spiderman Broadway show where people kept falling on their head. Did they abandoned that? Uh, it, yeah, eventually, yes. Spiderman turned off the dark eventually turned on the dark because people were dying, right. People get paralyzed and shit and they will fell. So my, my, uh, my wife worked at a audience awards which is like a frequent flyer points for Broadway and so she would go to all these shows and so she went to spiderman like during the previews and she texted me and she goes, one of the actors has been stuck for an hour, like just on the rope.

Speaker 1:          01:02:48       Oh my God. And she just said, yeah, he's been stuck for an hour. And I was like, I bet you know how he feels like it's just, it was her. She would go to all these shows and eventually like I wouldn't have to go anymore because she took me to a American idiot. And did you ever see that? The Green Day One? No. So I like Green Day. How dare you. I, I enjoy that song specifically. I wish Joey Diaz was here right now because he would, he would murder milking you? Well, I, I like, I like the song American idiot because it caused people who it was about to, to enjoy it without knowing it was about them. I liked the diversity of that, but the musical was, it was like when I was 30 seconds in before I was like, Oh fuck this show. It was like watching the best painters in the world tried to play football.

Speaker 1:          01:03:34       It was horrific because like that's a funny way of putting it. Well, I know that, I know that like green day isn't like real, you know, punk punk, but at the same time that's what the movement it came out of and it's supposed to be anti establishment and the whole point of the show, I mean, the Broadway thing of it basically made it like everybody's just jazz hands to fucking green. It was ridiculous. Kind of showed what green day really is all about. Look at this green day was, it's, it's a manufactured outrage. I was so disappointed because afterward I was like, I can't believe they lend their name to this. And then I looked it up and I go, oh no, they were in charge. It's like, that's it. That's the end of it for me. That's why everybody was correct. And I think that's one of those things where like people look at the, look on that guy's say that jared from subway, like who is that?

Speaker 1:          01:04:20       Oh No, it's Penn Jillette's younger brother, doesn't it look like? And that wasn't even a molestation. Joe Couple cigars on the far right with the two tone hair and the conveniently placed tattoos. I bet he's annoying. Yeah, I bet. I bet. In his last play he played like a salesman. How about the guy with the flannel shirt? Is that a flannel shirt or a jacket? It's a blazer. It's a flannel blazer to. He's the drummer for green. Yeah, that's Christ. Take that picture off job. Take it off. Yeah, man. There's a lot of that stuff. You know, it's like, it's like what we're talking about. We're talking about suits coming in and telling you what you can and can't say. I mean they're doing their being their own suits. They're trying to formulate something that they think America is going to absorb and then they're thinking about buying yachts. So avenue q is a great show, but the most fun part of watching it was watching the old Broadway people thinking that they're super naughty for going to the show just like these, like 60, 70 year old women who like just couldn't believe.

Speaker 3:          01:05:18       Like they said, masturbation. Like just. Yeah, that was kind of. I had fun watching people watch it. Well, if I was going to go to Broadway, that would be kind of why. I would go, I would go to people watch the really upper crust rich crowd of Manhattan Nights, the people that have homes in the Hamptons, like those people that go to all those Broadway shows and that's their social life. That's what they do. They go to parties, they dress really well, they eat really well and they go to the finest restaurants in town. They always get a table at the finest restaurants and here they are and it's like that's like their hobby is being rich and doing rich people things and if you want to be cultured, you have to read the New York Times, you have to read the New Yorker and you have to go to these musicals when they come out and you have to go to Broadway.

Speaker 3:          01:06:04       When it comes out there's a new player. You're going to be there. Yes we are. We have season tickets to the Broadway or whatever the fuck. They have season tickets to Broadway. Yeah, they can't. They do. They do. They're like multi ticket packages. There's a. those people have to do everything they can to be cultured, except actually talk to human beings. Well, they talked to a few human beings who are exactly like them. Yeah. But they don't talk to anyone who, you know what I mean? They might, they might know their gardener's name. Well, there's a bunch of people that are like that, that are just completely locked up and consumption and that's the only thing that they can discuss. I had this neighbor, I used to call them bling bling because a bling bling always had, like everything was shiny. He always had like expensive watches and they always had the nicest cars.

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       I couldn't talk to the guy about anything other than like cars and houses, you know, like I would say, hey man, how you doing? Good. Good, good to see what that guy did. His house looks like Shit. W what year is our car? Like? That's all he would talk about while he was into was consumption. What was good for the property values? Uh, where did you get to watch? Oh, nice. Nice Watch. Like, that was all he was into acquiring items, moving items around fixing items, making items better. But this was, he was the American idiot. I mean, he, he was locked into that. I mean, I knew this guy for years. I mean literally that is why I called them blink, blink. We'd never had a conversation about anything other than objects that he wanted or objects that he saw that he liked. I mean, it was really weird, but there's a lot of people like that out there.

Speaker 3:          01:07:36       Especially really rich people. Yeah. The uh, when people make this argument about like, oh, well, you know, we have to allow the rich to be able to spend their money because it's for the economy and that's why they shouldn't, you know, we shouldn't have higher taxes on the rich. I'm just like DC. How they, how they spend it. Do you see the, the ridiculousness that that has been like it's the problem with higher taxes on the rich, is that like what, what, what is, what's going on? What is capitalism like? What is it? Is it a game? And we'd try to. I mean, if one person works harder and they make more money and one person a is more innovative, they're more creative, they figured out a way to extract more money from the. Should they

Speaker 1:          01:08:15       be penalized? I mean, aren't we all trying to do that? Are we all trying to acquire money in some way, shape or form? And who is to say that one person, some Bill Gates type guy is better at it so they should be penalized. Like it seems like you're trying to rig the game because someone has just way fucking better at it. Well, I think the problem is that it's not. I don't have a problem with people who are better at it. I have a problem with the people who are the grandson of the person who was better at it. Exactly. That was just, just the idea of like, oh, you know, my uh, my father's father's sperm was real innovative. The Heinz account has always had good merit here. Yeah. Yeah. That kind of stuff. I inherited some. Money's a, that's a tricky one. I don't think it's bad for the people that get it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:00       Yeah. I look at the, uh, um, I look at the people who, there's that quote that I forget where it's from, but that quote that America is a nation of temporarily embarrassed millionaires that like everyone thinks that they're a millionaire there just going through hard times right now. I get it. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's one of the reasons why poor people vote for Republicans. Yeah. They really think, well, you need business new businesses who is more anti poor people than Republicans, but how many poor people wind up being conservative? It's like, what I want to say to those people is like, I get, you know, we all want to be millionaires. We all want to be successful and that's wonderful and we need a path to get there and that's fantastic. But tell me this, when you were 55 and you were working at applebee's, what the fuck is your path?

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       Where from here to there? You tell me. You tell me what app you're going to invent. You tell me what you know you're going to win on American idol as the old lady like you tell me how the fuck are you going to go from the lowest tax bracket to the highest one when you're already 55 and your dream has gone, but it can happen. See to say that it's kind of silly because we've. There's been a million stories about like someone who writes a book in their fifties and they become rich. I mean all that stuff has happened. It's just a matter of you, but you have to do it. Whatever it is, you have to do it. If you're actually just taking all your time and you're staying at applebee's and then you're drinking and then you watch the TV and any falling asleep.

Speaker 1:          01:10:23       That pattern. Yeah. If that person said to me while I've been working on this novel for a very long time and I have a lot of faith in and I've sent it to a lot of publishers and you know what? I've been rejected a lot of times, but I'm not going to take no for an answer and going to pound the pavement and where to find it. Maybe I'll self publish at my, you know, and I'll, and I'll walk around and I'll go to libraries. You know what? And I'll, I'll get my book in libraries and, and if they said all that, I'd be like, you know what? Don't pay taxes. Yes. Vote Republican. Yes. But if they're just like, well, you know, my, my brother's got this idea, right? My brother's got this idea, now it, he just needs a little bit of seed money. It's a little bit of seed money. That person. I'm just like, I don't understand why you're voting against your own best interest. Well, I don't think they think they are. They think that people are lazy. I work hard. Got Damn Lazy People. They want that welfare money. They're going to take that welfare. Just spend it on cigarettes. Yeah. Well, the, the uh, I love during, during

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       the a debt, you know, the recession, the collapse when everybody was talking about like, I don't like how the government spends my money, like the government spends money on things they can't afford. I'm like, you just lost your house in your car because you bought something you couldn't afford.

Speaker 3:          01:11:26       Yeah. But they thought they could afford it. Right. Just stupid. Like the problem with those goddamn mortgages, man. Yeah. That was the craziest Ponzi scheme ever. That you would have someone with an adjustable rate mortgage and all of a sudden the rate gets jacked up through the roof and you're paying three times as much. Like, what did I sign up for? Wait a minute. I was only paying $1,500 a month and now I'm paying 15,000.

Speaker 2:          01:11:49       There is, there is a great deal of deception and fraud and garbage that was done from the banks and from the people in charge. But there was also a great deal of people just didn't want to do their homework and they just, yeah, they heard something too good to be true and they didn't know the lesson of if it's too good to be true, it's not true. Yeah, definitely. It's the same people who like, they'll open up the email, they'll be like, what? What do you, what do you mean I got this email, we're all, I get all this money. I just click on this link right here from this person I never met. Like how do you not know? The first time I saw that I was like, this looks wrong. Well you're a smart Guy Steve. But that's what I'm saying. Like there's people, they're dumb. It's so difficult. So lonely.

Speaker 3:          01:12:30       The top of Olympus. Well, one of the things we were talking about earlier about debt and about people with credit card debt that they don't realize it. And if you had money, I cash money and you wouldn't, you wouldn't be so likely to go into debt with cash. Yeah. Well I think that's the same thing with the environment. I think the environment is almost like credit because it's like throwing garbage out the window and no one's thinking about it. We're burning fossil fuels and fucking spraying hairspray into this guy. No one's thinking about what that's doing because we don't feel it instantly and immediately. We don't have like a vault. We open up shit. I'm out of air. You know, I'm running low on fish left. Yeah, we don't feel it. So we continue to act in the exact same way because we're not really getting the feedback. You know, you watch an inconvenient truth. You went, well, that's Kinda fucked up. Oh God. I get to work in the morning, click, shut it off, go to bed. She abb up, wake up, keep going. And that's a pattern that just kept, keeps getting repeated and repeated and we're not feeling the feedback of the negative actions.

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       I was uh, I was flying and it was during that crazy winter with a polar vortex stuff where it was like negative two degrees and a lot of places and it got down to like negative 20 in the Midwest. What year was that? Two years ago. I think two, three years ago, yeah, it was a, I know in La we're just like, yeah, got all the way down to 55. It was terrible. And so, um, I, yeah, I got woken up by the bells of the ice cream truck. It was really a difficult winter, but the, um, but so I'm, I'm flying somewhere and there's this guy, you know, going through a in front of me and Tsa and, you know, he's taking off his coat and all that stuff. And Tsa got a cold, isn't it one of these small

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       airports where they all went to high school together and uh, and the guy goes so much for global warming and I, I need to leave well enough alone. I need to learn how to do that. But I was just like, I was like, oh, actually, you know, global warming also makes it colder in the winter. The Jews, he knew right away. And uh, yeah, he just, immediately he was, he just what he, his reaction actually was one of my favorite things anyone's ever said. He just goes, that's what they want you to believe. Oh, like they do because they're scientists and they want you to believe them. Well, Sam Harris was talking about this yesterday that trump is a global warming denier. Yeah. Global warming denier is really close to being the president of United States. He's not only is he global warming denier, but the good news is if he felt he would make money off of it, he would believe in global warming.

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       Oh yeah. For sure. There's no platform. He can't believe him. Wonder what the thought process behind that is. Just plow straight ahead and just do whatever's good for you and don't give a fuck or is there like. It's narcissism tists. We'll figure it out. Yeah, for sure. Right. That's really what it was answered my own question. I think it's. I think it's A. Yeah, it's what you were saying. The idea of like planning ahead and not know like I have this thing where it bothers me when someone's unhappy. Like Jane, when I can see on happiness, whether someone's mad at me about something I did or just someone's sad, like immediately I'm like, I have to fix this. You know, like, I don't know what that's from, I don't know how I got that way and I try to get over it to a degree.

Speaker 1:          01:15:40       I like being compassionate, but I also don't want it to like totally ruined me and I think that there are people who are wired and completely the other direction who they can walk by, someone bleeding to death and just be like, ugh. The sidewalk used to be so much nicer. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's probably like the type of person that you don't want an office. Yes. Yes. That's the exact type of person you don't put no, but you also don't want the type of person in the office is constantly worried about people being sad because then you'll never get anything done because it's 300 million people and at least 30 million of them are satisfied. Fuck, right. The least. I can look at statistics being sad all day with no problem. Oh, statistics don't fuck with you. It's actually humans. It's, it's the interaction with humans. What about puppies?

Speaker 1:          01:16:29       I'm a big dog rescue guy. Oh, me too. So I actually go to the fucking. I can't go. I'll take them all. Dude. On this past, on this past tour I did in 10 days. In 10 days I stopped and got for strays. I didn't keep them, but I like helped rescue for sure in 10 days. Just driving around. We found them on the street for strays in 10 days. You know, they were actually straight. I didn't know. People don't just like let their dogs out, the dogs come back. I used to have a dog like that. Well, one of them was, if it hadn't come back, I mean if it was laid out, it had been a couple of days, like it was like mad it up and everything. I'm, one of them was actually someone who like was someone who just keeps their door open and then their was just playing in traffic

Speaker 2:          01:17:11       and. But thankfully it to end, he comes out and he goes, I've been looking for him and I just go where you can a shit. Where's the dog? Uh, the third one was one who was, I don't think she's ever been owned. It was just on the streets of Louisville and just walking around near the airport and then the fourth one was actually one where this was the one that made me the most upset because leash and collar right outside of a dog grooming place. So I'm like, Oh shit. One got out and so this is in Phoenix and I'm running around. It's 95 degree heat and this dog is fast and I'm like running around trying to chase it. And finally there's this alcove in the shopping center where it goes in the alcove and I'm like, great. It'll be cornered. I'll finally be able to get it.

Speaker 2:          01:17:54       And so I go in there and there's like a woman with a stroller and I go, Hey, do you see a stray dog run by here? And then I see the dog in the corner and I go, oh, it's right there. And she goes, that's my dog because that's your dog. I've been chasing it for 20 minutes through a parking lot. It almost got hit by three different cars. And she goes, Oh, did it? Like, yeah. That's what happens when dogs run around parking lots. When people have strollers, they don't give a fuck about their dog. I'm concerned, concerned with this little baby, this dog and go fuck itself. I just think like, how hard is it to take that leash and just tie it to the bench that you're sitting on it. It's hard for some people just like, it's hard to not hold the baby over the grill enclosure. Very difficult. So that compels soon is real. The struggle is real. Be Like I've, you know, I really, I really don't want to let this dog go.

Speaker 3:          01:18:39       What am I, my favorite dogs ever. I got a call from these people that I knew they were a dog watchers and uh, they found a dog in their neighborhood and they knew that I had dogs and the new, I love dogs and this dog had mange. She had mange all over her body. She was really sick and they were like, we don't even know if, if she's going to be able to make it like so fucked, like open scabs because of it. She was so beat up. It was so sad and so they had washed her up and they had fed her and she was a really sweet dog and I'm like, look, I, I'll take a chance. We'll see what happens. Yeah. Within like a week, her manager had grown back. It was crazy. It's just the food. She's needed to be cleaned and needed food within a week. Almost all of her hair was like, it wasn't fully grown. It was all growing back and she turned out to be the greatest dog of all time, but I can't go around those dogs. I'll have a fucking house full of dogs. I have 100 dogs.

Speaker 2:          01:19:32       The one I have now, I did not plan on having him. I saw him in a shelter and he was just the cutest thing and, and I, I fostered him and two days in like we are someone like messaged me because I made like an instagram account forum so that like maybe we'll get popular and people, someone would adopt him and then someone messaged me and immediately I got the message and I was thinking like, don't you take my dog was mine. So He's, he's a Staffordshire bull terrier, which is basically like a pit bull. Yeah. It's like a, I call it a pit bull face on a pig's body. It's like he's adorable. And he like, what's crazy is so that breed, if you were to buy one, they're $2,500 and that's one without training, without anything like. And he was just sitting in a shelter and so anytime someone's like, oh well you know, I've got to go to a shelter because I need to really specific or sorry, I gotta go to a breeder because I needed a really specific dog.

Speaker 2:          01:20:25       I'm just like put their out there. Anything you want. Every single kind of dog is out there. And he's my mascot now I take them with me to comedy clubs and everything. Really? Yeah. Because he doesn't bark at all. I've heard him bark maybe like 10 times. Oh that's awesome. So I just, he hangs out in the greenroom. Uh, he like, he'll find like whatever comic, like left, like a box of like merge, like sometimes someone will ship merged or something. He'll just find like the box of shirts and just like use it as a bed. He's great. He's smart. He knows they're useless. Yeah. Yeah, man. Um, shelters are tough.

Speaker 3:          01:20:57       It's tough. It's tough to go there. It's tough to see that. It's just the people are so irresponsible there. So irresponsible with pads they get and we can't have this dog dog shit in the house. Like you got to teach them to not shit in the house next to just give them up and leave him in a cage and out of sight, out of mind. Go on with their life. What disturbed me is when I found out how many animals Peta kills everything

Speaker 2:          01:21:18       year. Oh, I got into it with the pita. A spokesperson on twitter. Did you? Oh, I fucked her up. Good. I was pretty happy with those at about. So she followed me on twitter and I just write back and I go, Hey, I'm, I'm so honored for the follow sincere the Peta spokesperson. I'm, could you let me know why Peter has a 90 percent kill rate? And so she starts doing, you know, the standard pr thing of like, well, you know, people bring dogs to us that, you know, don't really have much of a chance elsewhere. And so, you know, we're kind of a last resort. And I go, Oh, well, uh, that's actually not true because I know of shelters that are like that and their kill rate is one 10th of yours. So if you could explain it. And I just kept hammering her about and hammered her about it and hammer lightly, um, calmly. I wasn't like, shut up bitch like this, that gets you nowhere, you know, I was just trying to outwit her and it was a, it was a lot of fun. And eventually then she's like, look, I don't speak for Peta. And I was like, well, in your bio, on your twitter it says head of communications. So, uh, you do, and now you're speaking to me.

Speaker 3:          01:22:19       Is it a resource issue as PD does not have the money to take Carolyn?

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       It's actually a batman issue. Um, you know, how like ratio goal pause. Yeah. You know, how, how the idea of like in a, in the first Christian Bale Batman, a racial goal was kind of like who's that? Okay, so the, the bad guy in Bama and they were like, we need to save the city by destroying it, right? Like the humans are destroying themselves, so we're going to wipe this out and, and so that'll prevent the problem and that's what it is. Peta is basically like, there's a problem with like, we love these dogs and so to stop them from overbreeding we're just going to murder a lot of them. Like that's where they go with it. We'll see the head of Peta when you get to the top crazy person,

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       it's, well, it's not murdered for saying this. No, you shouldn't be. If they do, they're rude animal liberation organization. The, the, the real, the at the very head of a lot of these really radical animal rights movements. And by the way, I love animals so I get it. I get the wanting pets to be taken care of, but they don't want pets to be taken care of. They don't want pets. They think animals should be free, all animals should be free. All livestock, all pets, none of that should be real. All animals. She just existed in some sort of a wild state. They also, uh, she's gone on the record many, many times talking about how people should be eradicated. Yeah. And you know, and, and like things like that and the idea that they are dangerous. I've had them, they just are, you know, there are thousands of years of breeding to fight each other and if you're irresponsible, dog owner, pitbulls can be fucking dangerous.

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       Yeah. But at the same time, they say that about my dog, about my staffy. Yeah. But staffordshires terrorists. That's ignorance. They're not the same breed. See, there's a genetic according to law. They are. Yeah, but that's not. It's not right. The law is incorrect. It's just some stuff written down on paper when you deal with the actual genetic lines of the dog. I've had dogs that were, there, were there. The line was from fighting dogs and they were impossible. He couldn't take them to the dog park, couldn't take them. It didn't matter how much I trained them, they much how I, how much I was with them all the time. When dogs had blow up around them, he would get aggressive and he want to fight while night. I agree with you on a lot of things, but this is. This is one where where I have a completely different line because like I have a dog who is Chihuahua Basset Hound and I can't bring her nero that dogs, but that's an exception to the rule.

Speaker 3:          01:24:48       Pit Bulls are kind of the rule. The problem with pitbulls is if you get. It's a very dangerous dog. They're super powerful. They're really aggressive and they don't. They don't respond to pain the way a lot of other dogs do because it's been bred out of them. Like if you follow the way they breed dogs for fighting. When dogs fight, if they back away, if they cower, they were killed. That was the whole Michael Vick thing is that it killed all these dogs that quit in fights. So when you have all of that reinforcement genetically and you're dealing with a breed that's been raised like this for hundreds and hundreds of generations, you're dealing with an incredibly aggressive draw a dog with a really high kill drive. And when these dogs with high prey drive or given to irresponsible people, that's when you're getting all babies getting killed. Little kids getting killed, getting killed. I mean it is breed specific, but I mean that's also the same train of thought that people, you know, I, if you can put on a powdered wig and say that about quote unquote the Negro. No you couldn't because they weren't bred for fighting and killing. If you bred a bunch of people just for fighting and killing. Yeah, you can make that distinction. But pit bulls bred for fighting.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       I mean that's the. That's what they were bred for. That's why they look that way. I mean, this is a thing that's been recent though. They used to be used in hundreds of generations. It's not that recent. I mean they used to be, you know, the PIPA was America sweetheart. Yeah. Yeah. The PD from the little rascals had the pip, you know, whatever it was, but the was almost America's mascot by the way. Before the Eagle. Yeah. The eye. And I think the problem is also is that if a dog looks like a pitfall because people actually isn't even a breed. It's a, what is it, American something terrier. I'm is the actual breed that people are talking about. Well, it was an American bulldog mixed with a terrier. Terriers are more aggressive and then they made the new breed. Yeah. And then. But if you get a blood line from one that is a fighting dog, and this is not someone I'd love pitbulls.

Speaker 1:          01:26:55       I have friends that have pit bull. I love them. They're the sweetest, most friendly dog, but if handled correctly, they still have a problem being aggressive with other dogs. A lot of them do. Yeah. And they're really powerful dogs and in the hands of the wrong people, it's. We're not talking about labs. Okay. We have a lab. Labs are like universally loving and nice. You can get the exception to the rule. You get a bad lab, but overall Labrador retrievers are really friendly, easy going dogs, so when someone has a lab you go, oh, he's got a lap. When someone has a pit bull, there's a fucking reason why people go, oh great. He's got a pit bull because a lot of them are fucking crazy a lot. Well there and I think it. I think it boils down to who is handling the dog and the idea of if you.

Speaker 1:          01:27:40       I like, I hate when someone is like, I'm thinking of getting a pimple. It's like, well, either you need to know everything about it and then you get one or you don't what? You have to have a yard that contained that dog for sure. You have to be on top of it. When it comes to training, you have to really be aware. You have to read books on it. You should probably seek help with the professional, the behavioral specialist with dogs, but even then, if some dog threatens your dog or grounds or on your dog, it's likely that your dog's going to clamp ahold of it's neck. That dog's going to get fucked up, but that's also why I'm a huge proponent of leash laws. I think by the way, if la fuck these parking tickets, leash laws like you and you enforce leash laws and we will, we will have more money than any city in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:28:22       Right? Yeah. Well, I guess how many people really walk around with your dog without a leash? Is that really a problem? I, I couldn't. I don't know if I've ever walked my dog without running into someone who had an off leash dog. Yeah, that's irresponsible. Let's turn on a trail or something like that. I had, but even then I had a. So I was walking my dogs on this trail on a leash park in, I think it was fryman and uh, these two huge dogs come bounding at us, right? And now look, maybe they playful. One of mine's not, one of mine is fucking terror when it comes to other dogs. And so immediately we pick them up and this lady starts lecturing us about how you're not socializing your dog's correctly and they'll never learn. And

Speaker 2:          01:29:01       I was like, well, if you want my dog to bite your dog, I can put her back down if you'd like. But like that's why learn. Yeah. People who, whose lives are a mess. Always love correcting people. Yeah. I called to get your shit together. I call it a incorrect, incorrect. It's like, thanks for correcting me. Yeah. You need to socialize your dog. What? First of all, it's a little dog that you can pick up and big dogs running around. Probably should pick them up. Yeah. Dogs like to bite little dogs. They, they do it all the time. Yeah. It still looks like a raw, especially if it's the wrong kind of dog, you know, like huskies, all skeezer, Akitas, you know, like real aggressive dogs. There are so many people. There was one in my, uh, in my old neighborhood. We're walking our dogs and all of a sudden his dog comes charging at us and it was like a little dog.

Speaker 2:          01:29:45       And so we pick our, our dogs and my wife feels lease your damn dog. And the guy goes, this is a public space. And I go, yeah, that's why you lease your dunk. But where was this? Just a little lawn of an apartment complex. Oh, you know, like just a, just a place where people walk the dogs all the time. Do you believe unleashing your dogs on trails and stuff too? Like when you're in parks and. Uh, I mean if it is a non unleashed place, then that's fine. If it's at least place. The problem is, is that if someone's dog's leash and someone's dog isn't leashed that's a bad way for them to me because one dog feels trapped and. Right. So it's about expectation. So if I know that they're gonna be non leashed dogs there, I'm fine because I know I'm prepared and I'm ready, you know, and the, and the dog's prepared and et Cetera.

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       But if like all of a sudden the dog just comes out of the woods, like, that's not, that's not safe. Yeah, that's true. They're not robots, you know, they're not. Well, there's so much variety in the way dogs behave and the way dogs treat other dogs and other people. It's just, it's always like, what's this dog like, here comes the dog, what are we dealing with? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I have no idea. And I know that like even when I stopped for them on the road, I know that's dangerous to do because you have no idea if that dog is going to like try to bite you. But I've been bit. I haven't. Um, yeah. I keep a, I keep a slip lead in the car. I'm constantly keep an eye just have to slowly to my trunk. Wow. I've seen so many of them and I can't tell you how many times I'm like, I wish I had something to run this.

Speaker 2:          01:31:12       And when you capture them then when you put them in your car, what do you do? You just bring them right to a shelter a well so far I actually have not had that happen. Usually it is either like one time there was someone else there that happened to work for rescue that also stopped, uh, you know, one time there was a like a pet store right nearby. So I kinda like brought the dog into the pet store and they were able to hold him while a while. You know, the owner came, Huh? So I actually haven't, but. Oh No. You know, the one time, yeah, I brought, I brought a dog to in Louisville. I brought a dog to a shelter. Uh, the one that, uh, this past week where like I put her in the car and then I had to be super careful and disinfect everything because you never know. Oh, dad's and I have a dog and so I just basically I had my buddy who I had my dog with me when I saw the other dog, so I had my buddy, we were like half a mile from the hotel so he just walked to the hotel with my dog

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       and then I just drove the other dog to the shelter. And then you just hope someone adopts it. You just put it on social media and you hope. Yeah. If you pick up a dog that has fleas, the fleas getting the carpet of your car. Well, but, but that's the thing I've given up on flea prevention really, like it's something where I give my dogs a medicine for it, but like California has such a fucking flea problem that there's nothing you could do, like after a certain amount, like every, every dog has fleas. Really. It's, it's some, some react to it worse than others. My dogs don't have fleas, but there is. Look, you live in a special place.

Speaker 1:          01:32:35       You live in a magical cloud above Los Angeles. Magical cloud, the to killing thing. So they always fucks with me. It's amazing to me that people will justify it. Also there's video of them going to a porch and like leading someone's dog off their porch and taking it and killing it within a couple of hours. Yeah. And why do they do that? Why did they lead it off the porch? Again? They want to eradicate it. They just don't want meds. They just don't want pets. Yeah. So I think it's better to kill the pet than allow the pet to be with the person that they love to lead a life of slavery. So bizarre to see that kind of radical thinking, but that's just the case with everything, right? I mean you have your reasonable people and then you have your people that take that to the utmost and take it to the furthest, furthest point of rational thinking to the point where you're like, you're killing all the dogs.

Speaker 1:          01:33:30       You capture. One of my favorite things that I've seen was A. John Stewart showed a video of people merging to the, I think it was like the Holland tunnel or the Lincoln tunnel or something, and it was like one car, one car, one car, one car, one like you're supposed to do with merge. And every now and then someone would drive up on the shoulder and go around all of them and just be like, fuck everybody but me, you know. And that is who creates terrible policy. That is who shouts from the rooftops about it. Like that is who most of us will just drive one car, one car. Yeah. And understand that that's what you do because that's what you want to have. That one guy that's late for work every day. It's like, fuck, I saw a guy do that the other day. He, he hit the breakdown lane near a light light was about to turn green and he got into the, the side lane where people park and just gunned it through the intersection.

Speaker 1:          01:34:20       Yeah, almost plowed into people. And then you see him speeding up ahead because he was probably late for work was early in the morning. You know, there's so many people that everyday they barely make it to work on time and it's, it's like this adrenaline rush. They're addicted to. They don't even realize it. They're supposed to leave at seven, 10, seven, Fifteen, seven, 20, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. And they run out the door and it's, that's the race. That's the, that's where they're getting their chart. They're not getting chased by saber tooth tigers, but they are getting their adrenaline fix because that's the danger. Another thing that, uh, uh, that another Chris Bauer story, another comic was asking him about because he drives around and gigs all the. And someone asked

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       him about like, because he said, oh yeah, I never speed. And he's like, what do you, what do you mean you never speed? How do you get there? And he's like, well I'm in my forties now so I wake up 15 minutes earlier and then I still get there because that's all it is. Like at the same time it's hard not to speed because when you're like, when you have these straightaways when there are no cars near you and is like, why the fuck is the speed limit 60 here? Are you kidding me? I can go 100 safely easy. But at the same time the idea of like, well I just. What are you going to say if, unless you're doing like a 10 hour drive, you're not saving anything significant. Right?

Speaker 3:          01:35:34       Then there's the idea of the man telling you how fast you can go. Fuck him man.

Speaker 2:          01:35:39       Well I think you should be able to, to unlock levels like on your driver's license. That's a good idea. Like I could, I could get a 75 mile an hour speed limit. I could easily drive

Speaker 3:          01:35:50       75, have no problem. Right? If you're like a race car driver, if you know how to really drive and you're super responsible with your choices of lane changing and things along those lines, yeah, you should.

Speaker 2:          01:35:58       Being able to drive faster. The problem is how do you enforce it? You have to pull the person over and then maybe get a sticker on your car, something that's good and even drive an ugly car. Like I would drive, like I give me a purple fender, you know, GimMe Gimme, something ridiculous that the cops can easily see that and go, okay, that's a $75 an hour guy

Speaker 3:          01:36:14       and if you text in your car, if you text while you're driving, when you actually move. I mean, how many times have I looked over and I saw this car acting weird and they're texting, you should just, you should lose your license for a week. Here's the better question is when do we pay on the show? All You have to pee. Go peanut. All right, cool. We're going to wrap this up soon. Anyway, I got a Boogie soon. All right, I'll be quick. Go ahead. Go Pete, Steve Hofstetter. Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to see that video, you can find it on his youtube channel. Actually, if just look up, Steve Hofstetter destroys a heckler. You'll find it easy to find, but he's got a couple of multimillion view heckler videos. Wow. Maybe it's him. Maybe Bates. These people, we don't need to watch them, but he's probably Bayton these motherfuckers. Good dude though. But crazy traveling around fucking leashes, kidnap a dogs and yelling at Peta people, young mother.

Speaker 2:          01:37:04       Um, when I was walking around Runyon, uh, I was just, I had my headphones on. Dog came running up behind me. It's just, it scared me. Like whatever. Just a dog and then I kind of like good away a dog and away shoe shoe kind of thing. I know there's a girl behind me, but it came back like five minutes later was jumping at me and barking and I was like, get the. I finally got pissed, you know what I mean? It was like she was taking her dog and picking it up and get mad at me because I got mad at the dog.

Speaker 3:          01:37:29       Well, the people get mad that you don't know their dogs. Cool. Yeah. Like how do I know your dog could be a fucking maniac. Crazy bitch. I don't even know her. I'm talking to her earlier. She's really well, what do I do if I kick it and I'm an asshole now because your dog's going to bite me. I got to take a bite. Well that's also the problem with running with headphones on, but running with headphones on. It's so much more inspirational and running without headphones on. Just

Speaker 2:          01:37:50       found out today. There's a cool thing on spotify. You can have it set to your, uh, your, your pace, your

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       beats per minute and play like a symphonic Movi hike, action theme song stuff. So you pick your running

Speaker 3:          01:38:05       play, that kind of stuff. But it was talking about are running with headphones on. A dog came up to him and barking at them and know that that is a disturbing happens. It can if you're in the wrong place, the wrong time. And you know, obviously people do get bit, you know, fucking German shepherds, man. Those little fuckers. My dog got bit by a German girl, daughter rather got bit by a German shepherd recently. These people had this dog and I'm like, this is not a regular dog. You can't just have this fucking dog in your yard. He teach this dog and they're like, oh, well. She's a little rambunctious and it's like, I go, no, this is a working dog. This is a working dog. Do you understand like this is a really smart dog. It's going to figure out a way out of your yard and when kids are fucking with, it's going to bite them. This is what's going to happen. Unless you teach it like you have to take this thing now when it's eight months old and you got to really train it because it's already fucking 70 pounds. It's already a big ass dog. Like you're gonna have a responsibility. When you have a dog like this. This is not. This is not like a bulldog that'll just sit there and is happy to just drink water and chill out. This is a super active, really aggressive dog.

Speaker 1:          01:39:10       Yeah. It needs to think. It needs to. You need to give it puzzles. Maybe you can get the and get the birth control pill.

Speaker 3:          01:39:16       This is a sort of the same thing along those same lines we were talking about with pitbulls, like these animals are bred for a very specific activity. In order to discourage that activity, boy you're gonna have to fucking throw a lot of tennis balls. You're going to have to get this dog a lot of exercise. You're going to have to give this dog a lot of, a lot of activity, a lot of stuff that they can occupy their mind with humans being bred for office jobs. Yeah, exactly. Dude. You just fucking nailed it. Steve Hofstetter. We got to wrap this up. I gotta get Outta here, but I knew that I would have held. I would have held the P for a little longer to do.
