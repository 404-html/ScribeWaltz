Speaker 1:          00:00:00       People though. They really are. It's just fucking hard business, especially when you didn't see it coming to one. Hello Renee. Hello. Thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it. Thanks for having me. I listened to you on Sam Harris' podcast and I was utterly stunned. I had to listen to it twice cause I just couldn't believe it. Let's get into, let's get into this from the beginning. How did this start out? How did you start researching these, a online Russian trolls and bots and all this jazz?

Speaker 2:          00:00:30       Yeah, so a couple of years back in around 2015, um, I, I had had my, my first baby in 2013 and I was getting on these preschool lists and what I decided to do was I started looking at, um, anti vaccine activity in California because I had a kid and I wanted to, uh, you know, put them on preschool list. I was going to fit with the parents basically, um, as someone who vaccinates and I started looking at the way that small groups, we're able to kind of disproportionately amplify messages on social channels. And some of this was through very legitimate activity. And then some of it was through really kind of coordinated deliberate attempts to Kinda game, um, ways that algorithms were amplifying content, amplifying particular types of narratives. And I thought it was interesting and I started writing about it and I, um, I wound up writing about ways in which, um, hashtag gaming, um, ways in which people were kind of using automation to just be in a Hashtag all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:01:26       So it was kind of a way to really gain control of share voice and what that meant when very small groups of people could achieve this kind of phenomenal amplification and what the pros and cons of that were. And then this was, um, 2015. So the way that, that this sort of, um, awareness of social media challenges came, came about was actually when I was working on this. Other people were looking at it from the same, I'm looking at the same tactics, but how they were being used by Isis, by the terrorist organization. And they're also, you had this very small group of people that manage to use bots and amplification to really kind of own a narrative, really pushed this, this brand is this digital caliphate to kind of build it on all social platforms almost simultaneously. And the ways in which information was hopping from one platform to another, um, through kind of deliberate coordination and then also just ways in which information flows, kind of contagion style.

Speaker 2:          00:02:18       Um, and I wound up working on thinking about how the government was going to respond to the challenge of terrorist organizations using American social platforms to spread propaganda. Uh, so what we came to realize was that there was just this information ecosystem and it had evolved in a certain way over a period of about eight years or so. And the kind of unintended consequences of that and the way that Russia kind of came into the conversation was around October, 2015 when we were thinking about what, what to do about Isis, what to do about terrorism and terrorist, uh, you know, kind of proliferation on social platforms. This was right around when Chen had written the article, the Agency for the New York Times. And that was one of the first big expos A's of the Internet research agency. The first time in American journalist had gone over there and actually met the trolls, been in Saint Petersburg, and began to write about what was happening over there and the ways that they had pages that we're targeting certain facets of American culture.

Speaker 2:          00:03:18       So while we were in DC talking about what to do about terrorists using these platforms to spread propaganda, there were beginning to be rumblings that Russian intelligence and you know, Russian entities, we're doing the same thing. And so the question became, can we think about ways in which the Internet is vulnerable to this type of manipulation by anyone? And then, um, and then come up with ways to stop it. So that was how the Russia investigation began, was actually around 2015 and a handful of people started looking for evidence of Russian bots and trolls on social platforms.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       So 2015 if we think about social media and the birth of social media, essentially, it had only been alive for, I mean, what was Twitter, 2007 I believe. I think so, yeah. Something like that. So eight years, like eight years of social media and then all of a sudden they figured out how to game the system and then they figured out how to use this to make people argue against each other.

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       Yeah, I think so. There was this, uh, if you go back to like, um, you remember like Geo cities and they, yeah. Okay. AOL Use that course. Um, so we're probably about the same age. Um, so there have always been, you know, kind of the thing thing that was great about the Internet, like Internet 1.0, we can call it, right. It was this idea that everybody was given a platform and you could use your platform, you could put up your blog, you could say whatever you wanted. Um, you didn't necessarily get attention, but you could say whatever you wanted. And so there is this kind of consolidation as, as social platforms kind of came into existence, content creators. We're really excited about the fact that now they not only had this, um, this access to write their own stuff, but they also had access to this audience because as the network effects got more and more pronounced, more and more people came to be on social platforms.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       And an originally it wasn't even Facebook, if you remember, it was like, you know, there's like Friendster and myspace and social networks kind of evolved. When I was in college, Facebook was still limited to like, you know, a handful of like Ivy League schools. And so I wasn't even eligible. And, um, as you watch this consolidation happen, you, you start to have this information ecosystem really dominated by a handful of companies that grow very large because they're providing a service that people really want. Um, but there's a kind of mass consolidation of audiences onto this handful of platforms. So this becomes really interesting for regular people who just want to find their friends, reach people, spread their message, growing audience. It also becomes really interesting for propagandists and trolls and in this case terrorist organizations and state intelligence services. Cause instead of reaching the entire Internet, they really just kind of have to concentrate their efforts on a handful of platforms. So that consolidation is one of the things that kind of kicks off some of the, um, one of one of the reasons that we have these problems today,

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       right? So the, the fact that there's only a Facebook, a Twitter and Instagram and a couple other minor platforms other than Youtube, I mean anything that you can tell it's an actual person, like youtube is a problem, right? Because you could see it's an actual person. If you have, you're narrating something, you, you know, if you're in front of the camera and explaining things and people were going to know that you're an actual human being. Whereas there's so many of these accounts that I'll go to, like I'll, I'll watch people get involved in these little online beefs with each other and then I'll go to some of these accounts. I'm like, this doesn't seem like a real person. And I'll go and it's like Hashtag Maga, there's a American Eagle in front of a flag. And then you, you read their stuff and you're like, wow, this is, this is probably a Russian troll account. And it's strange, like you feel like you're not supposed to be seeing this. Like you've seen the wiring under the board or something and then you'll go through the timeline and all they're doing is engaging people and arguing, you know, for Trump and against, you know, whatever the fuck they're angry about, whatever, whatever it is, it's being discussed and they're, they're basically just like some weird little argument mechanism.

Speaker 2:          00:07:14       Yeah. So in 2016, um, there was a lot of that during the presidential campaign, right. And there were, um, there was so much that was written, you know, we can go back to the free speech thing we were kind of chatting about before. There's so much that was written about, um, harassment and trolling and negativity and these kind of hoards of accounts that would brigade people and harass them. Of course, a lot of that is just real Americans, right? There are plenty of people who are just assholes on the Internet. Sure. Um, but there were actually a fair number of these as we began to do the investigation into the Russian operation in, and it started on Twitter and about, um, 2014, actually, so 2013, 2014, the Internet research agency is targeting Russian people. So they're tweeting in Russian, at Russian and Ukrainian are folks, people in their sphere of influence.

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       So they're already on there. They're already trying this out. And what they're doing is they're creating these, uh, these, these accounts. It's kind of wrong to call them bots because they are real people. They're just not what they appear to be. So I think the unfortunate term for it has become like Cyborg, like semi automated. You know, sometimes it's automated, sometimes it's a real person, but a sock puppet is the other way that we can refer to it. A person pretending to be somebody else. So you have these sock puppets and they're out there and they're tweeting. And in 2014 about the Russian annexation of Crimea or about mh 17. That plane that went down with Russia, you know, of course I had no idea what happened and it wasn't their fault at all. And gradually as they begin to experience what I imagine they thought of what success, that's when you see some of these accounts pivot to targeting Americans.

Speaker 2:          00:08:49       And so in 20, late 2014, early 2015, you start to see the, um, the strategy that for a long time had been very inwardly focused, making their own people think a certain way or feel a certain way or have a certain experience on the Internet. Uh, it begins to spread out. It begins to, uh, to look outwards. And so you start to see these accounts communicating with Americans. And as we were going through the datasets, which the Twitter data set is public, anyone can go and look at it at this point. Um, you do see some of the accounts that are kind of, um, you know, that were, that were somewhat notorious for being really virulent, nasty trolls. I'm Andy Semitic, trolls going after journalists. You know, some of these accounts, um, being revealed as actually being a Russian trolls now it doesn't kind of, um, Xcel paid the actual American trolls that were very much real and active and part of this and expressing their opinion. Uh, but you do see that they're mimicking this, they're using that same style of tactic, that harassment to, to get it real people.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       Then if they do get banned, if their account gets banned, they just simply make another account. They use some sort of, uh, you know, um, what is it, a virtual virtual server? What does that call mean? Vpns or, yeah, so if they do that, they can kind of do that as long as they want. They can continue to make new accounts and it probably also emboldens the actual mirror controls because they're going to go out a little bit further than everybody else. A little bit crazier. And it kind of changes the tone of discourse within these communities that are arguing about a certain subject. Things get nastier and they're getting nastier because of the interference of these trolls. I Gade seems like they've, they've actually managed to not just cause a lot of discourse, but to change the way people were interacting with each other and to make it just make it more, more vicious.

Speaker 2:          00:10:46       Yeah. So the, what they're doing is they're operating in communities. So one of the really common criticisms of, you know, people who, um, lot of people think that this didn't have a huge impact. Didn't, you know, did it swing the election? We have no idea. Um, but the, what it does do in the communities that it targets is it can change that tone. And that's where you see, um, it's, it's, I mean, I think everybody's probably had this experience, you're part of a group and then a new person gets added to the group and the dynamic changes. Yeah. It's very much the same kind of thing. Just that these are not real people who are joining the group. Uh, and so there's this, um, opportunity to, to, to, you know, kind of expand the bounds of tolerance just that little bit more or try to normalize using particular ways of communicating that maybe a group wouldn't naturally gravitate to. But then it does. So there, there are definitely a ways in which any, any type of troll during this doesn't have to be a Russian troll has this ability to kind of shift the language shift the community shifts the, uh, the culture just a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       Now, when did, why did the agency do this and do we, do we know, do we have someone who's ever left there or become a whistle blower who can give us some information about what the mandate was and how it was carried out?

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       There've been a couple of a whistle blowers and actually some investigative journalism in Russia that's, that's covered this. Um, they describe the, the employees of the, it says the Internet research agency. So it's a little bit like a social media marketing agency plus, um, tactics that we would not expect a social media marketing agency to use. Things that are a little more like what you would expect to see from an intelligence agency. So besides just making your pages and your blogs and your social posts, they're also in their kind of, uh, connecting with real people and real activists and pretending to be something that they're not to develop kind of a one on one relationship, but most of the, most of the, um, the whistle blowers who have come out, there's a woman named Ludmila, Mila salvage chuck. Um, she wrote an say I believe on this and it's described as being much like you would expect if you were doing social media grunt work.

Speaker 2:          00:12:55       Um, you have a certain number of posts per day. You, you know, you're driving, trying to get a certain amount of engagement. Um, you're trying, you've got to kind of hit your quotas. I'm, most people are young millennials, the people that work there, um, they're well versed in trolling culture. They're well versed in internet culture. You know, they're up to speed on like popular memes and things like that. And so you do see, um, this, you know, and then the other thing that they do is they talk about in Mueller indictment, you see some really interesting descriptions of like the standups that they have stand is a thing you do at a tech company. Everybody kind of stands up and you talk about your goals and responsibilities and blockers and things. And in these standups they would be sitting there saying things like, um, if you're targeting black LGBT people, make sure you don't use white people in your, in your image and your mean because that's going to trigger them.

Speaker 2:          00:13:42       Um, you know, so trying to get at the, the very niche, um, rules for, you know, for communicating authentically and an American community, which is, you know, online, you know, you sometimes, um, there are very specific ways in which a community expects a member of that community to communicate. And so they are in there and you can read in these filings by Mueller's team and by the Eastern District of Virginia. Um, the, the, the degree of granularity that they have to recognize that if you are running a black LGBT page and your meme is of white people, you're going to cause some tension and consternation and assuming that that's not necessarily what you want to be doing, you should go find the meme of black LGBT people to put in the, you know, to, to put as your meme for the day. So there's a lot of, um, there's a lot of sophistication, there's a lot of understanding of American culture and then there's a lot of understanding of trolling culture. And so these things combined to be a rather effective, uh, you know, very effective social media agency.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       Then is there an overwhelming sort of narrative that they're trying to pursue? The trying to push? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       so what we saw, so I did the, um, I did some of the research for the Senate and the Senate data came from the platforms. So what I had was, um, the attribution was made by the platforms. It wasn't like Renee deciding this was IRA. It was the platforms giving it to, uh, to our government. And the information in there. Um, what it showed was that across all platforms, across Twitter, across Facebook, Instagram, youtube, they were building up tribes. So they were really working to create distinct communities of distinct types of Americans. And that would be, for example, there's an LGBT page that is very much about LGBT pride. There is, and they created it, they curated and they create it, curate it. Um, it has a, you know, there, it's like a persona. A lot of the posts on the LGBT page were written by what sounded kind of like a millennial lesbian was the voice.

Speaker 2:          00:15:47       Um, so it was a lot of, um, you know, memes of LGBT actresses and they would brand it with a specific brand. Market was a rainbow heart. Um, uh, LGBT United was the name of the page. It had a matching Instagram account, which you would also expect to see from a media property. Right. You would expect them to see in both places. And this, um, you know, they're red liga or like a, a young woman talking about, um, crushes on actresses and things. Actually, you know, it was, it was, it was really, besides the sometimes walking English virtually indistinguishable from what you had read on any kind of like young millennial focused, um, social page. It wasn't, none of it was radical or divisive. It wasn't like, um, the way that they got the division across was they built these tribes where they're reinforcing in group dynamics.

Speaker 2:          00:16:40       So you have the LGBT page, you have a numerous pages targeting the black community. That was where they spent most of their energy. A lot of pages targeting, um, far right? So, uh, both old far right, meaning, um, people who are very concerned about what does the future of America look like. And then young, far right, which was much more angry, much more like trolling culture. So they recognize that there's a divide there that the kinds of memes you're gonna use to target younger, right wing audiences are not the same kinds of memes are going to use to target older right wing audiences. So there's a tribe for older rightwing younger, right wing and the black community. There's a baptist tribe, there's a black liberation tribe, there's a add black women tribe, there's one for people who have incarcerated spouses. There's a, uh, Brown, I'm Brown.

Speaker 2:          00:17:28       Power I believe was the name of it page that was very much about Mexican and Chicano culture. There was native Americans United I, all of these are fake. All these are fake. And what are they trying to do with all these? So you build up this in group dynamic and over, and I did this over years. So this was not a short term thing. They started these pages and 20, 14, 20, 15 timeframe, most of them, um, they started some other ones that were much more political later. And we can talk about the election if you want to, but with this tribal thing, um, you're building up tribe. So you're saying like as black women in America, this is, um, here's posts about things that we care about. Here's posts about black hair, here's posts about child rearing, here's posts about fashion and culture. And then every now and then there would be a post that would reinforce like as black people, we don't do this.

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       And so, or as LGBT people we don't like this. And so you're building this rapport. So like me and you were having a conversation, we're developing a relationship on this page over time. And then I say like as this kind of person, we don't believe this. So it's a way to subtly influenced by appealing to an ingroup dynamic or appealing to like as members of this tribe, as LGBT people. Of course we hate Mike Pence as black people. Of course we're not going to vote because, you know, we'd hate Hillary Clinton because we hate her husband as, um, as people who are concerned about the future of America is Texas assumptionists you know, so, so everything is presented as members of this tribe. We think this as members of this tribe, we don't think this, that's why you see the,

Speaker 1:          00:19:08       I had a lot of, the posts were not even political. They were just sort of affirming the standards of the tribe. Yes. So they were kind of setting up this whole long game. Yep. And then once they got everybody on board or how many followers are these, do these pages have?

Speaker 2:          00:19:25       So the, there was kind of a long tail. There were um, I think 88 pages on Facebook and 133 Instagram accounts. And I would say maybe 30 of the Facebook pages had over a thousand followers, which is not very many. And then, um, maybe the top 10 had upwards of 500,000 followers. So there's, you know, same way you run any social campaigns. Sometimes you have hit, sometimes you have flops. Right. And what was interesting with the flops as you would see them repurpose them so they would decide, you know, the same way if you're running a social media agency, well we've got this audience, this page isn't doing so well. It's like rebrand it a little bit, change it up, try to, um, try to make it appeal to somebody else. So you, so you do see this, there is a, there is, um, I got this data set and I was going through these Instagram memes and you 130, 3000 of them.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       And I was um, there was a cluster of images of Kermit the frog. I was like, what the hell is Kermit the frog doing in here? And so I, so then I go, so this, the, the way the platforms provide the data is I got like a CSV of the posts and then I got a folder of the images. And so in order to like connect the dots, I had to have the image up on one screen. And the, this I'm thinking to the CSP up on the other screen, CSV. Uh, it's like a spreadsheet. Okay. Yeah. And I turned it into a database that we could track things a little bit more easily across the platforms. But, um, so I have this cluster of Kermit the frog memes. And I go and I look and I realize that the, they're attributed to an account called army of Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:21:01       And I thought, well that's interesting because you know, these are, some of them are really Raunchy. It was like, it was like Kermit Miss Piggy, like you know, I mean it was just like, like stupid, a stupid crappy memes. Um, attached to army of Jesus and like the hell is going on here. I keep going through it. Hundreds of Kermit memes and then I get to a post where they say like, um, this page is owned by homer Simpson. Now Kermit went to jail for being like, I don't know, they made some like some joke, it was stupid and all of a sudden the data set turns into homer Simpson memes. So again, like this kind of Raunchy homer Simpson culture, um, and again, it's attributed to army of Jesus. And then, yeah, go through all this and realize that they didn't get to actually making army of Jesus a Jesus focused page until like 900 posts in.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       So the, they just renamed the account at some point. It used to be called nuts news. And then they nuts news was what they called it when it was the Kermit the frog meme page. And then it gets repurposed when they realize Kermit's not doing it. It's not getting the audience they want homer Simpson's not getting the audience or engagement they want. And then they pivot over to Jesus and then all of a sudden they start, you know, the likes and, and things start pouring in. So what they're doing is they're actually like either deliberately or they're just creating placeholders. Um, it's kind of a red flag when a brand new account that was created yesterday suddenly starts talking about some highly politically divisive thing or whatever. But if you lay the groundwork and you do it over a period of two years, then somebody who goes and checks to see what the account was, where it came from, how old it is, is going to see something that was two years old.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       So it's an opportunity to create almost like sleeper accounts where you create them now and then you activate them, you politicize them, you actually put them to use a couple of years in the future. So we saw all kinds of, uh, you know, we, we saw this over and over again. There was a black guns matter account that turned into an anonymous account at one point. Um, they were pretending to be anonymous, you know, the hacktivist. Yeah. So, so they repurpose this black guns matter page, which just had, it was, it was advocating that black people buy weapons and carry and it was like a pro second amendment page, but for the black community. And they took that page when it wasn't getting, I guess a ton of engagement and it became a, it was called, um, oh gosh, I don't remember the exact name of the anonymous page.

Speaker 2:          00:23:23       And I don't want to say it was something that's legit, but, but ah, they pivoted into an anonymous page. And when they do that, do they go back and repurpose the con the content of the earlier posts? Do they change? That was not clear. That wasn't clear. We didn't get that information from the platforms. Um, there was a lot of stuff that I would've loved to have insight into. We could see again, you know, you'd think if you started following an army of Jesus page and yet all this Raunchy Kermit shit from like a year ago that would raise some flags. I would assume that they scrubbed it and restart it. But I don't know

Speaker 1:          00:23:57       your podcast with Sam changed how I look at a lot of the pages that I actually follow cause I follow some pages like that have classic cars or something like that. And then I'll see them in, most of it is just photographs of cars, like beautiful cars and it'll have, you know, they'll have a giant following and then all of a sudden something will get political and I'll, I'll look at it and go, oh wow. Like this is probably one of those weird accounts. Like they're getting people to get engaged with it because it represents something that they're interested in, like classic muscle cars and then they use it for activism and they use it for, to, to get this narrative across.

Speaker 2:          00:24:38       I think I, I mean I've seen it happen with some of mine too. Um, I think one of the challenges is like, you want people to be aware that this stuff exists, but you don't want them to be paranoid that it's everywhere. I know that's a problem. I look at this all day long and sometimes I see things and I'm like, [inaudible] what are the odds? Um, but, and I, and I try to, you know, not feel like, you know, you know what, I'm like filmmaker in some like Tom Clancy novel. But yeah, the, um, it's, it's this balance between when you make people aware of it, and I think people deserve to be aware, but they deserve to understand how this plays out. The flip side of that is you do wind up in these weird, you know, you see it happen on social media now, or, um, click into a Trump tweet and you'll see like, you're a Russian Bot.

Speaker 2:          00:25:26       No, you're a Russian Bot. Know you're like, they're probably not rushing pots. You know, it's in everybody who don't, like on the Internet is not a Russian Bot. Yeah, exactly. And so that's where you get at the interesting conversations of, you know, in some ways getting caught. This is, this is one of the challenges with running disinformation campaigns, right? It, it makes it really hard for people to know what's real after the fact that it leaves you a little bit off balance, right? Feel like, um, you know, when you feel like you can't quite tell what's real and that's part of the goal, right? It's to make you not have a, not feel entirely balanced and, um, and your information environment is this real? Is this not? And so in some ways there's not much downside to doing this right, because you do, you know, if you either knock it out of the park and you influenced the election and you influence people and you have this secret covert operation going on for years, um, or you get caught and then there's a, you know, until there's some confidence and the ability of platforms to detect this stuff, there's real concern among everybody that, um, that you're either, you're encountering something fake.

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       Now, the overwhelming

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       narrative is that the Russians were very much invested in having Trump win. Right. And if they were very much invested in having Trump win was the reason why they focus so heavily on the African American community because the African American community traditionally seems to vote Democrat. So they were trying to do something to break that up or trying to do something to weaken the position of the, the, you know, the incumbent or a Hilary Clinton and maybe put some emphasis on Jill Stein or some alternative candidates.

Speaker 2:          00:27:17       Yeah. So the, the way that the political campaign, the political aspect of it played out. So they established, they started building these relationships in 2015 and yeah, they're doing this, this tribal thing. We've got our ingroup are part of this community. And then what you start to see them do is, um, early, they're actually, there was a tiny, tiny cluster in the early primaries where they were supporting rand Paul and then they pivot to Trump pretty quickly and use, I'm probably ran, Paul just didn't pull well and they were like, there's no way to get any lift here. But, but maybe Trump was getting, you know, some actual lift in the media. And so, so you see them move into supporting Trump, and then for the remainder of the Dataset for it from 2015 through the end, which was mid 2017 or so, is when this thing ends.

Speaker 2:          00:28:03       Um, it's, it's adamantly pro Trump on the right and on the right. And you see not only pro Trump, but you see them really working to like a road support for mainstream or traditional Republicans, traditional conservatives. You see a lot of the memes about like, um, are you with the Conservatives are the Conservatives and there, you know, and so the Conservatives of course, her, like, they've got pictures of like Lindsey Graham and John Mccain, the, Hey John Mccain, John Mccain shows up a million times. Um, and, uh, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz. Well, I think that they, you know, one of the theories is, um, and, and I believe this is probably true. They really strongly disliked Hillary Clinton because there was concern that she would, you know, things that she was saying about increasing freedoms in Russia were very threatening. Uh, they thought the best bet to get sanctions removed was Trump. Um, so they had specific outcomes that they were hoping for.

Speaker 2:          00:28:57       And that was one of, you know, so there's always like a political motivation. So there is this narrative around they just want to kind of like screw with American society, create divisions, amplify divisions. When you look at the political content, the clear and, and sustained support for Trump. And even more than that, the clear disdain for Hillary Clinton. There is not on Facebook and Instagram, there was not one single pro Hillary post. There were some anti Trump posts. Because if you're running an LGBT page, of course they're going to say negative things about Trump, you know, and, and they're saying it. So you should vote for Jill Stein. There was early support, um, and some of the left leaning pages for Bernie Sanders, but you actually see the support for Bernie Sanders come in more after it becomes clear that he's not going to win because then they're using Bernie Sanders as a way to say this was stolen from him by the evil Clintons or Jill Stein.

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       You know, here's a true, a true independent, real liberal, uh, we should be voting for her if we want to support a woman. So there these feminism pages really pushing this narrative of Jill Stein. So you have the left leaning pages, totally anti Clinton, and then you have the right leaning pages, staunchly pro Trump, and also strongly anti cruise, Anti Rubio, a anti Lindsey Graham, basically ante every now what's called establishment Republican. Um, and there's this, uh, kind of pushing of people two opposite opposite ends of the political spectrum. So this is where you get at the conversation around facilitating polarization. So not just, um, it, it wasn't enough to just support Donald Trump. It was also necessary to strongly disparage, um, the kind of traditional conservative, moderate center right in the course of amplifying the Trump candidacy. Does that make sense? Yes, it does. And it was a lot of stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       Yeah, it is a lot of stuff, but it does make sense. And one of the things that was really bizarre to me watching the election and I was trying to figure out is this because Trump is so bombastic and he's so outrageous and he's just a different person that the, the way I was describing it on stage was that like finally the assholes have a king because they never had a king before. Like everyone who was running for president was at least mostly dignified. I mean basically it's really difficult to go back in time and find someone who isn't going to find someone who, there's no one who insults people like he does. I mean he insults people's appearances. He calls them losers. He called stormy Daniels Horseface. I mean he said some outrageous shit. So part of it was me thinking like, wow, maybe he's just ignited and embolden.

Speaker 1:          00:31:39       I actually had this conversation with my wife today. She was like a, it feels like racism is more prevalent. Like it's more, it's more accepted. People feel more emboldened because they're in their mind, they think he is a racist. I can get away with more things. Trump is president. Like there's actually videos of people saying racist Shit and saying, hey, Trump's president, now we can do this. So I was thinking that, well maybe that's what it was, is just sort of like some rare flower that only blooms under the right conditions. Poof, it's back. Right? But when you think about the influence that these pages have had in establishing communities and this long game that they're playing, like the LGBT pages, even though they're shitting on Trump, they really want to support Jill Stein because they know that I'll actually help Trump because it'll take votes away from Hillary Clinton that they, it seems different like political discourse discussions online and social media, the way social media reacted.

Speaker 1:          00:32:42       I mean, there's a lot of people that were anti Obama, uh, before me. No, me either, either of his election, he won, but it seemed different. It seemed different to me than this one. This one seemed like, like we had moved into another level of hostility that never experienced before and another level of division between the right and the left that I had never experienced before. And, uh, up like a willingness to engage with really harsh, nasty comments and just to dive into it, you would see it all day. I mean there's, there's certain Twitter followers that I think they're pretty much human beings, but I would follow them and they would just be engaged with people all day long just shitting on people and criticizing this and insulting that. And it seemed like it seemed dangerous. It seemed like things had moved into a much more aggressive, much more hostile and confrontational sort of chapter in American history. If this is all done at the same time that this is happening, w how much of an influence do you think this IRA agency had on all this stuff?

Speaker 2:          00:33:58       That's the, uh, that's the question that we would all like the answer to and I unfortunately can't give it. And so in your mind though, yeah, let me, let me, let me kind of caveat that. Um, the thing that we don't have that nobody who looks at this on the outside has, is we can't see what people said in response to this stuff. So I've looked at now almost 200,000 of these posts, um, as what I spent most of last year doing was, was this, was this research, and we can see that they have thousands of engagements, thousands of comments, thousands of shares. We have no idea what happened afterwards. And that's the problem. So when once the stuff comes down, it's really hard to go back and piece it together. So I can see that there are some, uh, per your point, the really, really just fucking horrible troll accounts that they ran.

Speaker 2:          00:34:51       They didn't necessarily have a lot of followers, but you see them in there, like adding people, so they're, you know, at, and then the name of a reporter at the name of a prominent person. And so they're in their kind of like draft on the popularity of, you know, famous people basically. Um, and they're just saying like horrible shit and it's, the tone is so spot on. And one thing that was interesting with a couple of them is like if you go and you look at their profile information, which was also made public, they would have like, um, they would have like a gab account in their, in their profile that was like, so they would, um, so it was a remarkable piece of, of, of kind of the culture in which you see that. Like they're actually sitting on Gab too, right. And so they can also go and they can draw on there and read it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       And there's, you know, 900 or something, a troll accounts were found on reddit there on tumbler. And so they're just picking the most divisive content and they're pushing it out into communities. And at the same time we can see that they're doing it, but we can't see what people do in return. We can't see, did they just block? Did they have the fight back? Did, was there a huge, you know, when this happens on a Facebook page, um, and they're doing something like telling black people not to vote, um, as black people, we shouldn't vote. Um, what do people say in response? And that's the piece that we don't have. So when we talk about impact, a lot of the impact conversation is really uh, focused on did this swing the election? We don't have nothing that I've seen has the answer to that question.

Speaker 2:          00:36:20       Um, the other thing is, but the second question, the thing when I think about impact, I think from, from, I think you and I agree on this, um, it also matters how does this change how people relate to each other. And we have no real evidence of no information on that either. This is the kind of thing that lives in some, you know, Facebook has it, the rest of us haven't seen it. No. Are Most of these people, is this mostly Facebook? Is it mostly Twitter or where, what is, how does it break down? Yeah, so there were, um, here am I like little stats here cause that would give you the wrong data. There were 10 and a half million tweets of which about 6 million were original content created by about 3,800 accounts. Um, there were about 133, I me just read it, 133 Instagram accounts with about 116,000 posts and then 81 Facebook pages and 17 youtube channels with about 1100, um, videos.

Speaker 2:          00:37:18       And so they got about 200 million engagements on Instagram and about another 75 million or so on Facebook. Um, engagements are like, likes, shares, comments, reactions, you know, um, so it's hard to contextualize what, what we think happened, you know, you can go and you can try to look at, um, how well did this content perform relative to other real authentic media targeting these communities. And what you see with the black community in particular is their Instagram game was really good. Um, they're, so they're on their Instagram accounts, the, you know, the top five, three of them targeted the black community and got, you know, tens, 200 millions of engagements. So I would have to pull up the exact numbers off the top of my head. Yeah. It's, um, it's on Instagram. It's all memes and then you know, so we have the memes and then we have the text on Instagram.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       You can't really share. So it's amazing that they got the kind of engagement that they did. Even without the sharing function. One of the things you can do is if you know the names of the accounts and there a lot of them are out there publicly now, um, you can actually see them in regram apps. So, uh, people were regramming the content. So Facebook says about 20 million people, excuse me, engaged with the Instagram content, but what isn't included in that is all of the re grams of the content that were shared by other accounts. So the spread and the dispersion of this. It's an interesting, uh, interesting thing to try to quantify because we have engagement data, but we don't know, did it change hearts and minds? We don't know if it influenced people to go follow other accounts. We don't know if it influenced people to not vote. Uh, there's just so much more, I think still to, to understand about how these operations work. Well, we can kind of, we can assume that it had some impact, right? I mean, yes, as, as you were saying earlier, when a new person enters into a conversation, it changes the tone of it. How much of what they did was their own original post and how much of it was commenting on other people's posts. So I thought you're actually going to ask a different thing there.

Speaker 2:          00:39:34       How much of it was then repurposing our own posts, right. Repurposing real American content. Um, did they do that as well? Yeah, tons of times. But let me, let me, uh, so they created a lot of their own stuff, particularly in the early days. And so you can actually read the Dataset. And one of the things when we started finding these posts, I was struck by how sometimes it read like Esl and then sometimes it red lake, perfect, flawless, um, professional English. And then other times it read like normal English vernacular. Just the way that we would talk to each other. And I started digging into what that was. So when it was vernacular English, when it was, when it, when it read like fluent American American English, it was, um, usually cribbed from somewhere else. So they would go and they would find a local news story from some obscure local paper and they would crib and then they would paste that.

Speaker 2:          00:40:25       And then, so the Facebook posts would be that cribbed a sentence from that article and then their meme, ah, maybe they would add a sentence underneath it to give it some kind of context or angle. When they would write their own stuff, you would see the sloppiness. That's where you could see, um, subject verb agreement is not quite there. The, you know, ways in which like Russian possessives are different than American possessives the slips there. Um, and then the other thing was the really funny stuff, which was, um, you know, a post that's supposed to supposedly written by a Texas secessionist, right? So you can probably have an image of a Texas secessionists in your mind as I say this. And it would be things like, um, Hillary Clinton is a terrible individual and as a, uh, as a terrible individual, it's completely impossible for us to back her in her candidacy for the American presidency. Furthermore, you know what it's like, furthermore, air go, you know, it is clear that, and I'm like, it reads like memory. You're like in English in college or something and you got to like write a formal essay. I was like, all right, so nobody actually talks like that, especially not, you know, your gear stereotypical Texas is

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       Ashiana. So it was funny seeing these, um, incongruities and that's unfortunately one of the best ways to tell what you're dealing with is actually to kind of look for those incongruities now and see ya as you read communications online, like, can, you know, does this, does this read like an American, does this read like a communication? And what we started to see was one way to not get caught for your lousy English or you're, you know, yeah. How your cultural, um, lack of, uh, kind of native, native, um, abilities is to just repurpose other people's stuff. And so that's where you would see memes getting shared from, uh, on both the right and the left. You know, you'd see a lot of these like turning point USA members that they were repurposing and pushing out or you would see, um, occupied Democrats or the other 98%. So memes from real American pages, real American culture. And they would just sometimes slap a new logo on and just repost it as if it was theirs. So it does in those instances read just like, you know, authentic American content. And in many ways it is authentic American content. How many people were working for this agency?

Speaker 2:          00:42:52       I don't remember off the top of my head. It was, um, somewhere between a couple hundred, a thousand, I think. I don't know if it's bigger than that. They're just, they just moved offices and um, it's a funny story. I guess they, um, moved offices and then people started calling in bomb threats to the office and it was just like every day a new bomb threat would get called on so they couldn't work. Basically. I assume this is like some American intelligence agency just like fucking with them, but just people calling in these bomb threats to try to keep them from working. And I think, um, there was an article that came out really recently that said that like army cyber or one of our, uh, one of our agencies work to just like, um, take them offline during the, during the midterms, couple of days around the midterms.

Speaker 1:          00:43:35       I wonder if whoever's calling and then is doing it and bad Russian. Yeah. Be So ironic because I was really funny, like move to the right,

Speaker 2:          00:43:42       nice new office building on someone chucked a Molotov cocktail through the window at some point. Like of course, yeah, of course.

Speaker 1:          00:43:48       Versus spy. Yeah. I mean, it only makes sense that in this bizarre and unpredictable and really unprotected, unprecedented environment that we find ourselves in, that something like this would come up and just sort of throw a monkey wrench into the gears of, of real conversation online. I mean it's, it's a really amazing time in that we're getting to see this kind of stuff happen in real time. We're, we're getting to see these, these sort of weird attempts at manipulating things. And I think in a lot of the successful, especially with less sophisticated people that don't really understand that they're being trolled and that someone fucking with them. And there's, it seems, I mean I've, there's a bunch of accounts that I have bookmarked that I follow, but I don't follow. So I don't follow them online lungs, I don't want them to know I'm following. I'm going to just go to them. And some of them are so strange, a few of them are flat earth accounts. This is something that I'm finding the conspiracy theorists. Yes. And some of them literally have almost, no, it's all memes and they don't say much. If anything underneath the memes and I go to it, I'm like, what? What exactly are they doing here? Like what exactly are they trying to do with these? Because they just, they're very weird.

Speaker 2:          00:45:12       There was one that I came across, um, I was looking at the, uh, the, the conversation around Gmos and because we have seen one of the things that Russia does besides the social bots and the, you know, the amount, you know, screen with like Americans directly, um, is the house. So this was a Republican House committee. The House, uh, science and technology committee about a year ago said that they were seeing evidence of, um, both kind of overt propaganda and then ways of, um, disseminating the propaganda. So there's always the dissemination and then the account and then the content. So it's like you look at three different things to try to get a handle on whether or not this is real or fake. Um, so when we talk about the accounts we're looking at, are they real people or they, you know, automated, are they not automated? When you're looking at the content, you're usually looking at the domains.

Speaker 2:          00:46:02       Um, and that's kind of the last piece, cause you don't want to have any kind of bias get in there, but you're just trying to see is it being pushed through like overt Russian propaganda domains, like their think tanks and things. And then the third is the dissemination pattern. Is it being pushed out through automated accounts? Is it spreading in ways that look anomalous versus how normal information would spread. So one of the things that the house committee looked at was using that kind of rubric. Um, Russian, uh, you know, these dubious, um, pieces of content and narratives around American strategic industries. So the energy industry, oil and fracking for example, or the, um, uh, you'd see a lot of stuff with, um, Gmos and agriculture. You know, this is very, his narrative of, um, you know, Putin and Russia being the land of organic, plenty in the United States, a serving it's people, toxic poisoned vegetables, this, the sort of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       And meanwhile, at the same time, there's competition for who's going to get the, you know, large contract to provide rice to some part of the world. So, so there's like an economic motivation underlying this, this kind of narrative. And I was looking at one of these accounts and it was tweeting and article about Hillary Clinton. A vote for Hillary is a vote for Monsanto, but it was tweeting this in, you know, just like three months ago or something. It was like mid 2018 or late 2018 when I was at this. I'm like, well that ship sailed a long time ago guys, why are we, why are we tweeting about, you know, Hillary's vote just because they just, they're just there to, it was written by a Russian think tank. And so they're, they just have these automated accounts retweeting, repurposing this content from forever ago. And it, it doesn't even make sense, it's just out there to amplify a particular point of view or bump up, uh, mentions of the site.

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       What were they trying to do with the Anti vaccine posts? Yeah, that was a, that was an interesting thing. So I would say not much to be honest. Um, the, there were 900, maybe 800, I think, um, tweets about vaccines in the content. And so Facebook and Twitter, you have this, uh, sorry, Facebook and Instagram. You have this building up of tribes. Twitter you have, instead they're just talking about whatever is popular, right? They're talking to her shit posting. They're talking about whatever's current, new whatever scandal has just broken anywhere. And you know, um, so Twitter is less about establishing relationships and more about joining the conversation and nudging it. And so most of the vaccine related posts, it was not a big theme for them. It wasn't something that was on like Facebook and Instagram where that's where they're really leaning in. Like, this is what we want Americans to think about.

Speaker 2:          00:48:48       So no mention of vaccines on those platforms. Not on Youtube, on Twitter. You see it in 2015. Funny enough, during the Disneyland measles outbreak, um, much like there's a whole lot of conversation around vaccines right now because of the outbreaks in Washington in New York. Uh, back in 2015 you saw the same thing, lots of conversations about measles because the Disneyland thing that happened down here. And so they're in there and they're saying, I'm vaccinate your kids. Don't vaccinate your kids. They had a couple of conspiracy theorist accounts. Um, I am trying to remember the name. It was a, it looked like a blonde woman. I think it's name was Amy. Um, and uh, Amy was a, was a conspiracy theorists. Amy was a fake person. Yeah. I wish I could remember his Twitter account. Um, God, what the Hell was her name? She Wa Amy Black.

Speaker 2:          00:49:38       Um, there, there are certain of the certain of their personas actually got a lot of lift. There was one called Woke Louisa that was a black woman. There was a, yeah, I mean they nail it right then and there. They're not dumb. Um, there was 10 GOP, the fake Tennessee GOP page. How much autonomy do you think these people have that are creating these things are the, it sounds like some of them are actually pretty funny. Yeah, they're funny. They're funny. That's why they work. That's what everybody thinks. It's just like, you know, in competent shit, it's not, it's actually really good. That's where that, that's, I think the thing that, you know, even with, um, whatever, you know, political proclivities you may have, I think you can at least recognize humor even if it's laughing at your side. And I will say that some of the stuff, especially the, the right wing, you know, the right wing, like youth kind of pages where they were funny, they really work.

Speaker 2:          00:50:32       And it was, I think that is, people assume that like they're too smart to fall for it. Um, it's just those liberals or it's just those conservatives or you know, uh, it's, it's really, it, it targets everybody and they understand the psychology, the motivation, the narratives and the culture and they produce the content accordingly. And I imagined that they had a grand old time doing it because there were some stuff and, um, two narratives that came out in 2017, um, the first was when Facebook started to moderate their pages, they started to scream about how Facebook was censoring them. So the exact same narrative that you see today about how any moderation is censorship. It's, you know, a picture of like Zuckerberg. And it's like, nice page. You've got to be a shame if anything happened to it, you know, and that's the meme that they're putting out there when they're complaining that they're fake.

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       Page got taken down. Um, there was, uh, tons and tons of these memes also about, um, the Russians did it mocking the idea that the Russians did it. Uh, so this is as the story is beginning to come out before we've had the tech hearings before we've had the Mueller indictment's before we've had the investigation, you see these memes, um, where it's like, oh, my speedometer was broken. It must've been the Russians or picture of Hillary Clinton. And it's like a in a like little golden book kind of thing. And it's like the whiny child's guide to blaming Russia for your failures. You know, and it's, again, it's funny, like the stuff is funny and they're like Metta trolling and you imagine them sitting there like, you know, they have a picture of like some like, you know, buff guy carrying a gun and they're like, I'm not a Russian troll man. I'm an American.

Speaker 2:          00:52:16       Wow. Okay. So you're looking at this and you're like, it's just so spot on. And again, I can't see what the people commented under it if they were like right on or if they were like, ah, this is bullshit. But so that's where you get at the, they, it's, you know, people think like, Oh, I'm too smart to fall for it, or Oh, this is targeting those other people. No, it isn't. That's the problem. It's just, um, it's going to target you with the thing that you're most likely to be receptive to just because of psychological bias and tribal affiliation and you're not sitting there thinking, how is this person who is purportedly just like me screwing with me? And that's why, uh, that's why it does manage to attract a following and get retweeted, get reshared. Um, it's good.

Speaker 1:          00:53:03       Well, it's so clever because it's so comprehensive. There's so much involved in it and the fact that they're willing to do this for years and years before they really sort of activate the political aspect of what they're trying to do. It also, it's, it's strange that they're so sophisticated about our culture because we don't know a goddamn thing about Russia. The average person knows Putin, bad, evil, warlord, Crimea, he invade. You know, like we, we, we have like a four year olds understanding. Like if you had a, if you just grabbed a person, random person that's true, college educated person and ask them to describe what's so bad about Russia. Wow. It's like communist over there or something man. Me, they fucking, they hate us. First of all, they have bombs like this. There's so little understanding of their culture, but yet they know so much about hours.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       That's one of the weird things about being an American. When you go, when you travel overseas and you realize how much they know about our elections, how much they know, we don't even know who the fuck there was running their country. We don't have any idea, but they know about Trump and they know that Hillary did this and they know that Bernie wants to give the money away. And you know, it's, it's crazy. It's, it's, it's weird. And these people must have like a deep education on, uh, American culture, American politics. Do you think they're training these kids? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:22       absolutely. I would. So they did a couple things that came out in the Mueller indictment. First of all, a couple of people actually came here and did a road trip around America.

Speaker 1:          00:54:30       Oh. Literally just to learn when to Texas? Yeah. Like basically telling me where you keep the beef jerky. But that's a,

Speaker 2:          00:54:38       that was in the, uh, one of the, I think the Mueller indictment of a, from February 28 teen, there've been three kind of big documents that have come out to from eastern district and one from Mueller on, um, on how it all worked out. I think another misconception is this notion of $100,000 in ads. They spent $18 million in 2017, I believe was the stat that came out during another one of the Mueller indictment's. So they're not just, you know, the money's not just going for the salaries and the ad buys. The money's also going for, um, they were talking about using kind of consultants. And this is where you get at this thing that comes out during the standup or they're like black people who are LGBT don't want to see white LGBT memes and, and this degree of granularity, the degree of sophistication. But then also what you see them doing is engaging one on one and that's where it crosses the line from social media operation to this as much more like, uh, like spying. You want to watch the Americans no idea. Oh, I love that show. You should definitely go to that. Great. It's great. It's too many things to watch. Totally. But what's interesting is the, um, it, it does paint a pretty interesting picture of like this, um, this couple under deep cover that are engaging with and pretending to be Americans and forming relations.

Speaker 1:          00:55:55       Jen, apparently it's based loosely on real people. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:59       That's what I've read also. But what you see in the, um, in the Mueller indictment is the text messages is the messenger, the Facebook messenger messages where they're going back and forth with real activists and they're saying things like, um, you know, hey, my ad account got shut down. Can you run some ads for me or the, um, hey, I want to help your protest. Um, we're fellow black lives matter activists and we see you're running a protest up and I think it was like Ethica or something. Um, Binghamton. How can we help you? We can give you some money for posters and they're sending money for posters or they reach out to a Trump supporter and they say like, we think it'd be really funny to have a Hillary Clinton impersonator sitting in a truck flatbed truck that's made up to look like a jail.

Speaker 2:          00:56:46       Let us, um, and if we give you some money, will you find the Hillary Clinton impersonator? And, um, put her in Jalan do this Hillary for prison thing. And so this is where another thing that they did was, um, using Facebook events to create real world protests so they're not limiting it to shit, posting online and making people feel tension online. They're actually sending people out into the real world to have in street violence. And so one of the things that they did was they coordinated Facebook event, um, one for the Texas secessionist page. And one for the, there was a pro Muslim called United Muslims. And on the same day, at the same time in Texas, they have a rally to support, um, Texas culture and resist the Islamicization of Texas across the street from a rally to defend Muslim culture. And so they, like, there's literally no, they just create these Facebook events on these pages and, and then they promote them with ad dollars and other things.

Speaker 2:          00:57:47       And, and you literally, if you go and you look at the Texas reporting from that day, um, I don't remember if it was dozens or hundreds, but a sufficient number of people showed up that they had literally on opposite sides of barricades, police officers in this center screaming at each other because one group is there for the resists, the Islamization of Texas, and the other group is there to like defend Muslim culture. And so you get to, you know, two opposite sides of the spectrum in the same place at the same time. And you literally insight like a mini riot. So they were there. There were about 81 of these events where they were holding, um, black lives matter style rallies for victims of violence, police violence, um, memorials for people who were killed by police officers. You know, things that real Americans would do, but this wasn't being done by real Americans.

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       And that's, that's the insidious thing, right? Is how does, how does Facebook detect that? How to, you know, how to you when you see this come to defend Texas culture and you're a diehard proud Texan, you know, you're not thinking like somebody in St Petersburg is, is, is organizing this. And that's the, I mean, I think that the idea that this was just some memes, um, is just not, it doesn't respect the significance of what they were trying to do and how effective that they were with these other things where even if they're just trying it out just a little bit, just working to see what works. They're always experimenting. They're always trying to find ways to create that tension. Um, and that's the thing that I think is so interesting about this, right? This evolving, this idea of an information war where these tactics evolve, um, and you are really at a disadvantage when it comes to actually detecting them.

Speaker 1:          00:59:35       Yeah. And on the outside, if you're looking at that, you'd say, well, okay, what is their objective? Why would they have this Texas a session as page across or rally across the street from a pro Islam rally? Why would they do that? You know, if you're on the outside, you think about the amount of effort that's involved in doing something like this and they are also doing this with no leaders, right. There's no one there that's running it when they get there. Yeah. So all the pro Texas people go here we are looking over there. So mother fucking enemy. I think

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       couple times there were comments, um, on some of the like archived pages and things where you could see the screenshots of people being like, Dude, you hell, it has all come out there. And like nobody showed up.

Speaker 1:          01:00:19       Right. Who is in charge? You know, they're probably throwing a lot of things against the wall hoping that

Speaker 2:          01:00:25       seven something stacks. Will you see this on the, um, there was a page called black matters and black matters was interesting cause they went and made a whole website. So they made a website, black matters, you ask.com, which I think is still active. It's dormant. They're not updating it, but I believe that you can go in and read it. Um, and it was designed to call attention to police brutality type things. And so they had this black manners. You ask page and then there's the black matters Facebook page, the Twitter account, the Instagram page, the youtube channel, the soundcloud podcast, the tumbler, the Facebook stickers. They had Facebook stickers that look like little black panthers. Like little, um, little cats. Yeah, a little black cats. They were actually really cute, very well done. Um, so you have this entire fake media ecosystem that they've just created out of whole cloth, all theirs.

Speaker 2:          01:01:15       And then what they start to do is they start to put up job ads. And so it's Cumbia designer for us. Come be a, uh, come write for us, come photograph our protests come, um, you know, they have like a kind of like, um, black, I dressed in a cool outfit like hipster, you know, holding a sign, like join black matters. Um, you see them go through a couple of different logos the same way you would if you were starting a, you know, a media brand. Um, they start posting ads for, do you want to be a calendar girl? Send us your photos and do you want to be on a black reality TV show, send us video clips of you. Um, do you like, they begin to do real work to ingratiate themselves with the community that a physical fitness thing. It was called black fest.

Speaker 2:          01:02:00       And the idea was that it was, um, kind of vaguely militant task. Um, and that it was supposed to teach a black people how to handle themselves at protests. Should there be police violence had a fight back. And they actually went and found a guy, a physical fitness, you know, martial guy, and they were paying him via paypal. So, so, so he was running classes for the black community under this black fist, um, brand. And they would like text him or call him. He played some of the voicemails on TV. Actually I heard them, um, after my report came out, I think they tracked him down and um, and he just talks about how they, yeah, they just pay pal them, you know, a couple hundred bucks. Every time you run a fitness class, the voicemails, like it was a little concerned. The police say you'd, you'd be, you'd be surprised.

Speaker 2:          01:02:55       They actually had a youtube channel with two black men named Williams and Calvin. And there was this channel, Williams and Calvin and actual book actual, yeah, they hired these guys to be a fake youtube channel. Um, and it was a, it was called a word of truth, I think was what the name of it. And so Williams and Calvin and these two guys would, um, would give their word of truth and their word of truth was usually about, you know, how fucked up America is, which I mean, there, there are very real grievances underlying all of this. And that's the problem, right? They have things to exploit. Um, and writing these things for these gentlemen. I imagine. I mean, imagine they were definitely paying them and they organize the channel seems likely channels organized. Yeah. All that. That particular one, I think that they were actually, they were in on it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:44       They knew what they were doing that because one of the guys who was in that channel popped up again in 2018 right before the midterms. Like maybe even the day before. I'm trying to remember the timeline here. Um, and he made a different video saying he wanted to, this was amazing, saying he wanted to leave the internet research agency kind of. So he was saying, um, basically, um, I'm tired of doing this work. I want to, I want to do a leak. I want to show you all of the things that the Internet research agency has done. And so they actually put out this. So this guy who had been in the Williams and Calvin video, so people recognize his face in the 2018 midterms goes and says he wants to leave and he's going to leak all this information and sorry, this damn cough.

Speaker 2:          01:04:33       And he wants to to like confess. I don't remember all the specifics because it was right before my thing came out and I was so busy working. But um, but yeah, he pops up again and he is saying he like wants to expose the truth and I think most people didn't cover it, didn't pay attention. Youtube, shut down the channel and deleted the video immediately. Um, why they do that? I think that it was seen as another influence operation. You know, you don't trust the, um, so even intention that he's going to expose it was probably just another level. Well, what wound up coming out, this was, this is so convoluted. I'm sorry. I know it's like hard to explain without visuals. Um, what they wound up doing was they did drop a bunch of docs. So they did release a pile of documents in which they claimed they actually hacked the Mueller investigation.

Speaker 2:          01:05:23       Mueller had nothing. And so this is again, another kind of, um, convoluted piece of this where they do release information. And so in this particular example, they release information that we believe they actually got through legal discovery. So the documents that the investigation provided to one of the indicted Russians were the documents that they then leaked claiming they had hacked the Mueller investigation. So they're constantly doing these things to generate press, generate attention, create just that degree of people don't know what's real. Um, or they read the headlines that are then released by the more propagandist overt Russian propaganda. And they think that that is the true story, that, that, that, that is, um, that, that the Russians hacked the Mueller investigation. So there's always this, um, how do we create fear, uncertainty and doubt? How do we throw people off? How do we come up with these extremely convoluted spy games that leave people feeling unbalanced, that make people wonder what they can trust, who they can trust and what's real. And even as somebody who looks at this stuff, you know, day in and day out for years, um, I, I do still regularly get surprised by the, uh, by the sheer kind of ballsiness and ingenuity of, of, of, you know, some of the stuff is it as it comes to light?

Speaker 1:          01:06:46       Well, it's really fascinating that they went so far as to hire people to make a fake account on youtube and hired these black guys to pretend that they're doing that on their own and they're really being hired by the Russians. And then when the guys leave, you don't know if they really did leave. Yeah. You don't know if this is just more bullshit. It's like in, like you were saying earlier, if they get you and you buy into it, hook, line and sinker, they win. If they get you to think, well, how much else is bullshit? They still went, Yup. Because you're looking at everything with sort of this tainted lens now everything seemed, and the sense that's probably the ultimate goal is to disrupt our social media environment and to sort of hijack the, the natural conversations that are taking place.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       Yeah. And I think it's, I mean, it's effective. There's certain, you know, I was in Estonia last year, um, and they've been targeted by this stuff for decades now, have a 25% Russian speaking population. And most of the news that they get is from Russian media, right. You know, right on the border. Um, they talk a lot about the extreme commitment to educating their citizens to make them realize that this kind of thing does happen. This is what it usually looks like. Um, don't share it here. You know, just ignore it. Let it go by. And I don't think we're quite there yet. I think there's still plenty of people in the country who don't believe it happened. Um, or for some reason are completely incapable of separating the Russian social media influence campaign happened from it means Donald Trump's election is a legitimate, or it means Donald Trump colluded, right?

Speaker 2:          01:08:35       Those are very different statements that you don't have to collude in order for someone somewhere to unsolicited go and support your candidacy. So you can believe two things simultaneously. One, that Trump did not collude and that his election is perfectly legitimate and that this had no impact and to that it still happened. And that I think is, um, I am consistently amazed when I read my social media mentions it at how hard that ability to hold those two ideas is for, for people. They just believe that if they're supporters of Trump, they absolutely cannot acknowledge that this operation took place. And I, or if they are passionate supporters of the far left, um, it's more of like an equivocation, you know? Well, we don't really know if they did it well. The rest us bad things too. Well, how do we know? You know, so that's where, um, it, it, it plays out very differently depending on which part of the political spectrum you sit on. Well, it falls right into our, the

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       issue that we have with cognitive dissonance. If we believe in someone or if we want someone to win, especially if it's our team or our person or on our side, you know, like I, I, yeah, I saw a lot of this when Donna Brazil released her book detailing how the DNC sort of rigged the primaries against Bernie Sanders and, and, and for Clinton, there was so many people that were Clinton supporters. It just didn't want to believe it. I was like, well, why wouldn't you believe this woman? Like you believed her before when she was supporting Clinton and then when she leaves now you know, you won't believe her. It's because it's inconvenient. And we were real weird in our binary view. We want things to be good or bad. It was one or zero. This is it. And this is a super complex issue. It seems like they've been doing this for a long time and they've gotten really sophisticated at it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:29       And I think there's a lot of people that have been sucked into it that have no idea that it's actually influenced the way they've, they've formed their own opinions. This is where it gets really strange. People are so malleable and they're so easily manipulated. Many people are that something like this, like a real good solid, concentrated effort to try to target these groups that have these very specific interests and really dig in and form roots and then go out. I mean, it's so sophisticated. They're their approaches. I'm on one hand horrified and the other hand deeply impressed. Yep. Me Too. Now was this freaking you out when you had to like go over all these memes and you were actually laughing them

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       and you're like, God damn it. Well, you know, there's the tweet that goes around every now and then. You don't have to hand it to them. And I'm always like, ah, how do I, um, how do I properly convey, uh, um, recognition for the, you know, I don't think we do ourselves any favors by pretending it all sucked and didn't matter in they're incompetent. I think that you have to acknowledge that you have a sophisticated adversary that is very capable. They're very determined, that is constantly evolving. Um, and to treat that with the degree of respect it deserves. I think that that's just common sense actually. Um, I, I, I read media on both sides of the aisle and I, I, you know, um, I feel I try to stay current actually on what memes are percolating in lots of different spaces and part just because I am always curious about what's organic versus what seems to be disproportionately amplified or what new communities are popping up.

Speaker 2:          01:12:12       I just think it's an, I think be spread of information among people is just very interesting. You know, it's, it's something that interests me a lot. I think crowd psychology is really interesting. I think ways that crowd psychology has transformed as the Internet has kind of come into being, particularly with things like the mass consolidation, the ease with which we can target people. You know, we didn't even really talk about that. But the, um, one of the things with, there's all, you know, even in the decentralized Internet, there's always been propaganda. There's always been crazy conspiracy theories, all this stuff. But it's that you can reach the people who are likely to be receptive to it now and as people self select into tribes, particularly in this country right now. Um, one of the things that's remarkable is the way in which once you've self selected into that tribe and this is the media in your ecosystem and you share it with your friends and Facebook and that the people who see it are the people who are most likely to be receptive to it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:07       Where if you run the ad targeting you directly, you know, send it into the feeds of people most likely to be receptive to it. We have this interesting phenomenon where consolidation targeting and then these gainable algorithms mean that it's just this kind of information goes way farther away, faster than it ever could in the past, regardless of whether it's Russia pushing it or, um, Iran as we've seen a, you know, a network of Iranian pages went down recently. Um, we see this globally now. We see countries targeting their own people with it and it's just this is the information ecosystem. This is like the new infrastructure for speech at it. Sorry. Privileges this kind of sensationalist content. Yeah. Do you have hopes? Would be great. Don't feel bad. Um, who's, who's seen all this stuff? I mean, has, obviously

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       Facebook has a check this out. I'm sure Twitter's aware. What has their reaction been and is there any sort of a concerted effort to mitigate some of the, some of the impact of these these sites have?

Speaker 2:          01:14:25       Yeah, lots of it actually. So I think, um, in, in 2017 was when we started, like we being independent researchers, I guess people on the outside of the company's academics, um, began to find the content, you know, really began to investigative journalists would identify the name of a page and then me and people like me would go and we would scour the Internet looking for evidence of what was on that page. So I found a bunch of the stuff on Pinterest, for example, wrote about it. Um, guy by the name of Jonathan Albright, uh, found a crowdtangle data cache. And with that we got the names of a bunch more pages, bunch more posts, and we had some really interesting stuff to work with. Originally. The platforms were very resistant to the idea that this had happened. And so as a result of that, they were, um, in, you know, there was a, the first thing that Zach said in 2016 when Trump gets elected Twitter, it goes crazy that night with people who work at Twitter saying, oh my God, where are we responsible for this?

Speaker 2:          01:15:38       Which is very silicon valley thing to say. Um, but what I think they meant by that was their platform had been implicated as hosting Russian bots and fake news and harassment mobs and a number of other things. And there was always the sense that it didn't have an impact and it didn't matter. And so this was the first time that they started to ask the question, did it matter? And then Zach made that statement. Um, fake news is a very small percentage of, you know, whatever on Facebook, the amount of information on Facebook and the idea that it could have swung on election was ludicrous. So you have the platforms, kind of the leaders at the platforms digging in and saying it's inconceivable that, that, that this, you know, could have happened. And as the research and the discovery begins to take place over the next nine months or so, you, you, you get to the one the tech hearings happen.

Speaker 2:          01:16:30       So I worked with, um, high by the name of Tristan Harris. He's the one who introduced me to Sam. Um, and he, he and I started going to DC with a third fellow, Roger Mcnamee and saying, Hey, there's so much, there's this body of evidence that's coming out here and we need to have a hearing. We need to have congress ask the tech companies to account for what happened, to tell the American people what happened. Because what we're seeing here as outside researchers, what investigative journalists are writing, the things that we're finding just don't line up with the statements that, that nothing happened. And this was all no big deal. And so we start asking for these hearings and actually, um, myself and a couple of others then began asking them in the course of these hearings, can you get them to give you the data? Because the platform's hadn't given the data.

Speaker 2:          01:17:26       So it was that lobbying by concerned citizens and journalists and researchers saying, we have to have some accountability here. We have to have the platforms account for what happened. They have to tell people, um, because it had become such a politically divisive issue. Did it even happen? And we felt like having them actually sit there in front of Congress and account for it would be the first step towards, um, towards moving forward in a way, but, but also towards changing the minds of the public and making them realize that what happened on social platforms matters. And it was, it was really interesting to, to be part of that as it, as it played out. Um, because one of the things that Senator Blumenthal, one of the, one of the senators said was actually said, um, Facebook and Twitter have to notify people who engage with this content.

Speaker 2:          01:18:19       And so they are, there was this idea that, um, if you are engaging with propagandas content, you should have the right to know. And so they started to push messages, Twitter, send out these emails to all these people, um, saying you engaged with this Russian troll. And, um, Facebook created a little field, a little little page that told people if they had liked or followed a troll page. So it was really trying to get at making the platform's accountable outside the platform through email. Huh. Too. Which is interesting because I would never read an email that Twitter sends you. This has just gotta be nonsense. I didn't get one. So I maybe, I guess I just got lucky, but, um, I might've had a multiple day back and forth. It's a rush. But that was I think one of the first steps towards saying like, how do we make the platforms accountable?

Speaker 2:          01:19:14       Because the idea that platform should be accountable was not a, a thing that everybody agreed on in 2015 when we were having this conversation about isis. And that's where there's the, the through line here, which is, um, and it does connect into some of the speech issues too, which is what kind of monitoring and moderation do you want the platforms to do. And when we were having this conversation about Isis, there was a, um, not insignificant collection of voices that were really concerned that if we moderated isis trolls on Twitter, they're not the beheading videos. There were sort of universal agreement that the beheading videos should come down. But if we took out what were called the Isis fanboys, which were like 30, 40,000 accounts at their peak, um, that we would, yeah, there's a document called the isis Twitter census for anyone who wants to actually see the research done on understanding the Twitter network in 2015 there is a sense that like one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.

Speaker 2:          01:20:14       And if we took down Isis fanboys, um, where we stifling their freedom of speech, freedom of expression and like goodness, what would come next. And that when you, when you look at that, um, that fundamental swing that has happened now in 2018, 2019 where those are, is that same narrative because originally no moderation was taking place and then now there's a feeling that it's kind of swung too far in the other direction. Um, but the original conversations were really, how do we make Twitter take responsibility for this? And legally they aren't responsible for it, right? They are legally indemnified against the, they're not responsible for any of the content on their platforms. None of the platforms are. There is a law called communications decency act section two 30, and that says that they're not responsible. They have the right to moderate but not the obligation to moderate because they are indemnified from responsibility. So the question becomes now that we know that these platforms are used for these kinds of harms and they are used for this kind of interference, um, where is that balance? What do we want them are responsible for monitoring and moderating and how do we, um, how do we recognize that that is occasionally going to lead to an incorrect attribution's people losing accounts and things like that. So

Speaker 1:          01:21:41       yeah, they're, they're in a weird conundrum right now or they don't, they, they're, they're trying to keep everything safe and they wanna encourage people to communicate on the platform. So they want to keep people from harassing folks. But because of that, they've also, they've got these algorithms and they, they, they tend to miss very often like this whole learn decode fiasco where people are getting banned for life for saying learn to code, which is about as preposterous as a guest. I think the learn to code fiasco is going to be the tipping point where a lot of people in the, in the future when they look back on, when did the heavy handedness become overreach, learn to code because I mean, Jesus Christ, I mean that if you can't say learn to code. I mean I look in my mentions, I mean on any given day, especially like yesterday I had um, uh, a vaccine proponent. Yeah, yeah. Peter's Great. And, and, and you know, and it seemed like what was really disturbing to me was like, the vast majority of the comments were about vaccines and so few about these unchecked diseases that are running rampant in poor communities, which was the most disturbing aspect of the conversation to me. That there's diseases that rob you of your intellectual capacity that are extremely common, that as many as 10% of people in these poor neighborhoods have almost no discussion. It was all just insults and, and you know, you fucking chill and

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       this and that. You know, it's going to be interesting, but no, they're going to be a disaster. I know, I know. Well, let me, let me, I think that one of the challenges for the platforms, there's a lot of things start out like learned to code. I remember I watched that play out. Um, Covington Catholic was another thing that, I mean, God, um, I learned to code. There was some of the people who are trolling and just saying learn to code and you know, whatever, you don't have a right to not be offended. But then there was the, um, the other accounts that kind of took it that step further and began to throw in like the ovens and the other stuff like that. It would learn to code. Right. And that's one of the challenges with the platform, which is if you're trying to assess the, um, just the content itself, like if you start doing keyword bands, you're going to catch a lot of shit that you don't want to catch.

Speaker 2:          01:24:03       But the flip side is if you, you know, the, the, this is the challenge of moderating at scale, which is, um, where, you know, what, what side do you come down on, do come down on saying like 75% of people with Hashtag learn to code or just, you know, I'm not doing anything incredibly offensive. And then the 25% who are, they really changed the tone of the overall campaign and the Hashtag for the entire community. And that's where you see Twitter I think come in with the more heavy handed and just shut it down kind of thing. Um, I don't, I don't know that there's an easy answer. I think that we are, you know, even today, what was the latest kerfuffle? Elizabeth Warren got a, an ad taken down on Facebook and then there was a whole conversation about, was Facebook censoring Elizabeth Warren. I, I personally didn't think that it read like censorship, but it was, um, it was an ad about, funny enough her a platform to break up Facebook is kind of, it seemed like it sort of read more like a cell phone.

Speaker 2:          01:25:07       Like she had a picture of Facebook's logo in the, um, in the image and there that violates the ads terms of service. And the reason behind that is actually because Facebook doesn't want people putting up ads that have the Facebook logo in it because that's how you scam people or if it's a great way to, to rip people often. So probably just like an automated, um, you know, an automated take down like an automated, they get halts the ad you have to go and make some changes and then you can proceed it back out again. Uh, but it just happens at a time when there's like, so little assumption of good faith and so little assumption of, um, such extreme, uh, anger and polarization and, um, you know, assumption that, um, the platforms are censoring with, with every little kind of moderation snafu that it, it makes it, I think, I don't know how we have the conversation in a way that's healthy and look towards solutions as opposed to the left screaming that it sends her the right screaming that it's censored. The platforms, um, you know, trying to get around, how do we both moderate and not moderate, which is a tough position to be in. Um, I think, I don't have any

Speaker 1:          01:26:18       good, no one does. No could answer the issue in Vigia discussed that pretty much in depth what she was saying. This is about moderating and scale when you're talking about millions and millions and millions of posts and a couple thousand people working for the organization. And then algorithms and computer learning that's trying to keep up. And that's where things like learned to code and people are so outraged and pissed off because when they do get banned, they feel like they've been targeted. Whether you really just ran into some code and then it's really hard to get someone to pay attention to your appeal. Right. Because there's not enough people that are looking at these appeals and there's probably millions of appeals every day. It's almost impossible.

Speaker 2:          01:27:01       Yeah. And there's, you know, you'd depending on which, um, which side you're on, you're also here like, um, this person is harassing me and I'm demanding moderation and nobody's doing anything about it. Uh, so it's, it's definitely I think, gotten worse. Um, it's, it's interesting to look back at 2016 and wonder how much of the, um, where we are now is in part because not a whole lot happened in 2016 in 2016 it was 2015 in particular, very light, like almost no moderation, just kind of let it all hang out there and I look at it, um, I look at it now, particularly as it evolved into this conversation about free speech, public squares, um, and what the new kind of infrastructure for speech and what rights we should expect on it. It's a really tough, um, you know, I think some of it is, is almost like the people who are, who hear the words free speech and they just assume that it's people asking for carp launch, right.

Speaker 2:          01:28:09       To harass and saying, you know, um, how do we balance that? You have to think Jack and vagina were saying this on your show. 'Em, how do we maximize the number of people who are involved in making sure that all voices do get heard without being unnecessarily heavy handed and moderating a thought or content and instead moderate behavior and um, and said moderate, um, particular types of signatures of things that are inauthentic or things that are coordinated and looking at this again gets to disinflation too rather than trying to police disinformation by looking at content, really looking instead at actions and behavior and account authenticity and dissemination patterns cause a lot of the worst trolls and stuff or just using these throw away accounts and then they disappear. Well

Speaker 1:          01:28:58       you have the impression myself that when we're talking about censorship we're talking about moderating content that really we're talking about this current era and that what's coming is essentially a, we're like putting up a small like twig fence and a herd of stampeding buffaloes on the way in terms of the, the more invasive or the more, the more potent levels of technology that are on the way. I just feel like I feel like we're, everything is moving into very specific direction and that very specific direction is less boundaries between people and information and that includes communication and it's going to be insanely impossible, insanely difficult or nearly impossible to to moderate in 10 years. I just don't think, I don't think that's going to be, I don't think it's going to be in the wheelhouse. I just, I think it's going to, we're, we're entering into some weird place where we either going to have to stay off of social media because it's just too toxic or grow a thick skin and just be able to deal with anything. And then if that's the case, how are we going to be able to differentiate between things that are particularly designed to, to manipulate a specifically designed to manipulate us and change our opinions by foreign entities like this. You know, this Russian troll farm.

Speaker 2:          01:30:24       I do think the, the, you know, when I think about like, so if we believe that the misinformation is impart facilitated by gainable algorithms, consolidation and then the targeting, the kind of things we've talked about through this conversation, then I think that the algorithms piece, the manipulatable algorithms, that's really squarely the responsibility of the platforms. I don't think that there's any regulation or, um, you know, any kind of framework that's going to come from Congress that's going to address that. Well, that was pretty clear from the Facebook hearings, right? I mean, they barely understand that don't know an android phone, an iPhone. They really don't know what's going on. Tim Apple. Yeah. Yeah. That's the king of the world. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:31:12       So as he did that on purpose, which is even more hilarious, just say you fucked up, man. I mean to say that you've nuked Tim Cook, his real name wasn't Tim Apple two. It is funny. Call them to apple. Although I did. I appreciate it. The rest of like every CEO in silicon valley changing their Twitter handle afterwards. Yeah. That was fun. But I think the, uh, which, and I just lost my train of thought on that too. Sorry. We're talking about you were, you were talking about them. Oh yeah. Regulate any algorithm. Yeah. So I think that ultimately the algorithmic piece does remain squarely in the purview of the platforms. And that's because it's an arms race, right? As they change their algorithm a little bit, tweak it for the product function, which they just do in their roles business. Um, there is no that's going to come down fast enough to catch that.

Speaker 2:          01:32:01       I think actually finance is an interesting parallel here cause like in the financial markets there kinase multi tiered levels of regulation and oversight so that there's always some entity responsible, whether it's the exchange or a self regulatory organization or the government. And the SEC looking to see if like information integrity in the markets is being maintained. Right. There's no shitty algorithm coming in to manipulate people. It's just making sure that we have that level of trust. So I think that right now the tech ecosystem is lacking regulation and all of its forms. So that will likely change. But the argument for decentralization is, I don't know how you execute it. I the antitrust thing in particular as it as it comes up so much more now, um, just me, I don't know under what economic grounds you make that claim that's way outside of my wheelhouse and my area.

Speaker 2:          01:32:56       But there is something to be said for this, you know, return to decentralization in some way. Yeah, I like it lets people have what they want. Um, and it lets you, you know, read, it's a great example. You have these, um, it's almost like federalism. You have this central platform, but then you have these little communities under it and each community has its own norms. Each community has its own rules. Nobody who violates the moderator rules in a reddit and scream censorship has really taken seriously, right. The, this is the rules of the community or in the community. There you go. And this was how in the olden days of the Internet, like use nets and things, you would have this as the community that you've chosen to be a part of. If you don't like the moderation standards, you'd go to this other community. Right. I think the concern with consolidation is that people who do get moderated away feel like there's nowhere for them to go, um, that they've lost access to the entire world.

Speaker 2:          01:33:51       Um, so I think if you have that decentralization that it in some ways, um, it, it, it stops being quite so much of a freedom of speech issue. If you can't speak on, you know, if, if you, if everything is like if there's 50 different platforms and you fall foul of some sort of norms or standards or community membership in this one, you can go over here to this other one. Right. And then the idea that somebody has moderated you away or a d platform, do you or something is much less, um, potent. Maybe if there are alternatives

Speaker 1:          01:34:27       though, if you dock someone or something along those lines. Yeah, there's still like federalism thing. It's like

Speaker 2:          01:34:33       moderation at the lower levels versus, um, it's kind of top level. Like you're summarily booted off.

Speaker 1:          01:34:40       Yeah. That seems like the best approach. Right? Like, it seems like the best approach is to sort of let these communities sort of establish themselves. But even inside those communities, then you have people that gained power through moderation and they sorta abusing it and then it becomes some sort of a weird hierarchy. It's like the decentralization in general. It's probably the right move for all this stuff. But how does that happen with something like Facebook or Twitter without government intervention? And I, you know, this, one of the things that Tim Paul was bringing up, like if you guys don't do this, if you don't handle this, it's entirely possible somewhere down the line you're going to be regulated by the government. Do you really want that? But that's an inevitability whether they think so. Yeah. At this point, yeah, it's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          01:35:30       Well, you know, honestly I say that and I think back to the reality which is in this congress with this executive, I don't know how we get any regulation through. Um, I, I think we've seen some examples like the honest ads act, which was introduced right before the first tech hearing, if I'm remembering the timeline correctly. So that would have been like late 2017. And what they said was, um, it's when you can no longer have like a free for all with ads on social platforms where nobody knows who paid for it or where it's coming from or anything like that. And um, and what they, you know, that, so senator Klobuchar and Senator Warner and I think Senator Mccain also was, uh, was part of this, um, create this law saying that the platforms have to follow the rules that TV and radio already follow.

Speaker 2:          01:36:26       And this is an example of recognizing the role that, that, you know, these are no longer startups. They can't be, you know, that that can't meet these obligations. It used to be that Facebook was exempt from these, um, from these, uh, disclosure requirements because they're ads used should be those, remember those tiny postage stamp sized things that were on the right side of the page. So they had a finding. It was, they were, they were, um, given the same exemption that campaign's kept for like skywriting and postage and pencils, you know, where it's like literally the form factor of the content makes it such that you can't put the ad disclaimer on there. And it used to be that all of the advertising on Facebook was regulated using that same finding that, that, that these postage stamp size things are too small to put the, the disclosures on.

Speaker 2:          01:37:15       And then of course, as we know that evolved into the ads being looking much like an organic post. And so now they do have these little little things that pop up where you can see why you got targeted and what it is. I think that that's an example of like the credible threat of regulation and the public opinion moving the platform to take an action that it wouldn't have necessarily done on its own. So it's not regulation, but it's, um, it's a nudge through public opinion and, um, the credible threat of future regulation. We've seen California go after the platforms. Also recently, there was a California GDPR thing from last year, um, California legislature saying we're going to pass a privacy requirement. Um, and uh, and they did it. They got it done. What is the privacy requirement? Oh boy. Um, I feel like I'm probably not the best person to explain this because I don't know the specifics, but the GDPR was the law in the UK and in Europe.

Speaker 2:          01:38:16       Um, that protects the data. It creates particular protections like you're, um, you have to re opt in for targeting there certain kinds of targeting that they can't do, certain types of data that you can request they delete. So this is a provision that took effect in Europe last year and we don't have that same law here in the u s where we don't have the same data protections as the Europeans. And so California Gdpr was the California state government, the state Senate legislature passing a law that basically mimicked a lot of the provisions of what the Europeans were given under Gdpr. But what that did was it created a law that applied to the people of California. And so Facebook and Twitter and the others don't want to be in a position of having to have this, um, you know, kind of balkanization or a bomb, a legal requirements. And so they in turn have now I believe, gone to Congress suggesting that a, that we're going to need to have a federal solution that applies to all of the u s so a federal level privacy regulation, um, because they don't want to have to adhere to the privacy regulations of like each individual us state.

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       One solution that's been tossed up was that people would have to somehow or another confirm their identity. Then instead of it being an anonymous posts that it would have to say, Rene de Resta, like, I know who you are. You have to have a photograph, have some sort of a government id shows that it's you, that we would somehow or another minimize trolling, minimize this information if you, if your account was connected to a social security number or whatever it was. The problem, of course is that these damn things get hacked all the time. And if your Twitter account gets hacked, now they have your social security number, they have your address, they have your information that you use to sign up. And you know, there's a lot of it unless there's some way and there isn't too, absolutely lock down all that data and make sure that it's an accessible to some sort of third party that doesn't seem like a likely course of action either.

Speaker 2:          01:40:19       And I think, um, the question of identity, I think most social science research, um, that I've read has suggested that that's not necessarily the be all and end all. I think it depends on, um, [inaudible] per your point what you're trying to do. I'm thinking right now of the, um, there was this request for FTC comments for net neutrality and I know that, um, a lot of them were, you know, whoever left them there, lot tons, I think millions actually of, of these fake comments that were left on the net neutrality, um, call for public comment where they were scraping, um, like the, you know, those, um, those crappy data brokers as horrible things where like your name and your address is up there and like, no matter how hard you try, you can't get it done. Um, so scraping those to grab names and addresses and then email addresses and leaving.

Speaker 2:          01:41:14       I'm leaving comments pretending to be those people. It's, it's hard. Nobody, most people don't want to enter their social security number and to some form or validation. Um, a lot of people will point to things like, well, you know, America has a strong commitment to anonymous speech. So, um, so there's that and cultural thing. Oh, I think, you know, people will point to like a federalist papers and penis and so on and so forth. Official blowers and whistleblowers. Yeah, I think I've seen, uh, I remember when Facebook did make it a requirement to you have to validate your actual name and address. They send a postcard to your house if you want to run political ads. Um, and then I remember people complaining that people who didn't have you know, that this was going to, um, what was it? Oh God, this was during the Daca arguments.

Speaker 2:          01:42:04       So, um, that, yeah, during the, it was during some of the illegal immigration debates, right? Right. As this was happening, um, people began complaining that immigration activists who are undocumented would not be able to run Facebook ads because they didn't have a identification to verify with. So no matter what people put out, there's going to be somebody who has a complaint about it. So we're in this, this like, um, this gridlock, everybody recognizes that the situation sucks and that social media is a disaster on a myriad number of, of fronts. And there's not much in the way of a plausible solutions I think for disinflation in particular, just to stay in my wheelhouse, we're trying to push towards multistakeholder ism, which is just to say can we create, um, the back channel channels of communication that have come up for election integrity and things over the last few years, last year and a half.

Speaker 2:          01:43:11       Can we standardize that in some way? Um, can we create an oversight body? Maybe the FTC that is at least responsible for, um, having some oversight to make sure the platforms are doing enough. But this is, I think this is going to be the, the theme of 2019. Does it, does it go the antitrust route? Does it go the privacy route? Like does it do a kind of hybrid combination of multiple, um, tackling multiple problems at once. It really curious to see how we shake this out cause it just seems like no even agreeing on what the problem is or not quite there yet. And you're, you are seeing calls like particularly from Elizabeth Warren for

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       breaking up a lot of these larger institutions, not just, not just even social media, but even Amazon. She's talking about breaking up a lot of these bigger companies. Um, it's the problem with that is like to what and make them what and then what happens. And then, you know, one of the, what if one of those things that you broke up that becomes Twitter becomes more popular than the other Twitter and it has much more attendance than what he'd do.

Speaker 2:          01:44:20       Yeah. You should get one of those people onto it to just talk about that. Cause um, Lena Connor or somebody who, um, really Matt Stoller knows this space in and out and I just don't, um,

Speaker 3:          01:44:32       the eye, you know,

Speaker 2:          01:44:37       personally what I feel like the, a lot of people are moving into smaller communities. A lot of people are moving into groups are moving into whatsapp chats. They're recognizing that the system as it is right now has this toxicity and are withdrawing a bit. I don't know if you've seen this in your friends, your community, but yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:44:58       Well I have it in, Jamie and I were actually talking about it yesterday in terms of the, the use of Twitter, the use of Twitter dropped. And um, one thing that I notice is that my follower numbers doesn't move very much on Twitter as opposed to like Instagram. I don't really use Facebook, but Instagram, there's a giant difference in how many followers I get per day on either platform. And it seems to me that the people that are using Twitter, they have kind of like locked in. They've found their little communities and it's mostly toxic. I mean, I mean, I'm sure I'm generalizing, I'm not, it's, I am for sure. It's probably not even 10% toxic, but it seems toxic. You know, when you look at those kind of comments and anytime something happens, it seems like the reaction to it is very rarely is it some sort of a objective, rational discourse. It's most likely just insults and swears. It's weird. It's just, uh, it, it, people are communicating in a way online that they communicated in real life. There would be blood in the streets.

Speaker 2:          01:46:08       I think about that a lot actually. Yeah, I do. I think that the um, and what are the, you know, especially I was listening to your, to your thing with, with Tim and Andy and Jack and vagina,

Speaker 3:          01:46:20       the

Speaker 2:          01:46:21       yeah. Of the Public Square. And I use this metaphor too, like when I write about them that the privatized public square, but then I think about it sometimes I'm like we've never had a national public square. There is no such thing in the history of America as a National Public Square. There are regional public squares or a town squares, state squares, you know where there is again this kind of federalism, um, people who have self selected to live in a particular community norms in that community. But if I were to go up to you in a public square and start screaming in your face or you know, being an asshole and trying to get a whole mob together to go after you, like probably somebody would intervene either a bystander or the police. And we have notions of like nuisance and things like that. We have notions of like there's, there's more of a, an intuitive sense of the balance between speech, which is to be protected and then the kind of fighting words and that sort of thing. There's no clear lines on that. There's not much in the way of norms. And when you're online there is nobody who is going to come in and step in and intervene in a way that would play out in, in real life. So the, I think that we, we have, we just haven't quite ported those norms of basic good behavior in the real world, um, into this massive roiling crowd that's just sort of always on at all times. And that's, that's sort of more where we are on social media.

Speaker 1:          01:47:48       Well, I think there's actually a carry over to real life from social media that you can find in these protests at universities when conservative speakers come and then antifa wants to shut them down. And then you have people like the proud boys fight with Antifa. I don't remember that before ever. I think this is, this is a byproduct of the type of communication that's the norm on social media. I really think that's what's happening here. I really think that instead of social media mimicking real life, real life is starting to mimic the kinds of interactions that people have on social media and with violent repercussions. It's certainly if not violent, very aggressive and angry in a way that it go back before social media. When was the law, I mean in 2000 and in the 1990s how often were there these incredibly volatile protests at universities where you have conservatives and liberals screaming at each other and you have these, these people that are being deployed at formed and, and they won't let them speak at these colleges and then they're, they're gathering up this online mob to try to bolster support and then people come to meet them.

Speaker 1:          01:48:59       We're going to stop them at all costs. And it's kind of, it's kind of flavoring real life versus real life being represented in social media. Yeah, I don't, I don't remember it from when I was in college either. No, it didn't exist. Not, not the expert on, you got to go back college protests and the, you know, maybe people would point to the 60s want to go back to Kent State. That's what I was gonna say. You gotta go back to war protest. But they were protesting something very specific, an unjust war that nobody wanted to be a part of. This is a weird time. Yeah, it is. It, um, I know it feels unstable. Yes, yes. That's the best way. But it's also awesome. I'm enjoying the shit out of it. I mean it's, well, because I, I love fact that it, it, for the first time in my life, it does not seem like the government has a fucking handle on how people are behaving and thinking at all.

Speaker 1:          01:49:56       Like they don't know what's going on. It's like you've got people that are, you know, people that are trying out socialists tropes and, and, and socialist ideas for the first time in the main stream and they're getting a big groundswell of support behind it. And then you have a lot of people that are like pro nationalists and Pro America for the first time. In a long time. And that's getting a lot of support. There's more discourse now, even if it's toxic. And I think a lot of it isn't, I think, like I said, if 10% is toxic, it seems like it's all toxic. One out of 10 people calls you a piece of shit. You're like, I've got to get out of this fucking forum. Right. I mean, that's, that's really how it feels.

Speaker 2:          01:50:35       I think that's true. There's definitely a, um, I've noticed that too. The actual numbers of, of, of a horrible trolls or maybe this afternoon will be different. I don't know, don't try to prove you wrong. It's, I, you know, I'm on Twitter a lot and, uh, it's the platform I use more than any other. Um, so for all the, you know, for all the complaints, I do feel like there's some real value there for me personally. And, um, and I, I like, I like the serendipity of, of the unexpected being pushed into my feed occasionally. Sometimes it's, you know, uh, sometimes of course I get angry or, you know, feel annoyed or think, why the hell didn't you know, why, why this? Um, but I think ultimately the, there is a lot of value to the platform. I think we're, unfortunately, I really do believe that so much of the polarization and the conversation around speech is people who got burned during the laissez faire days of 2015, 2016 in mentally linking up the idea of free speech with the idea of being harassed online.

Speaker 2:          01:51:52       And I think when you look at, um, this is purely an opinion, I have absolutely no data to bear this out. But when you look at those Pew studies that show, um, that younger people are more likely to want, you know, it's safe spaces or less, you know, less offensive opinions. I, I do sometimes wonder if that's a, um, an effect of coming of age at a point when, you know, random ass holes were screaming at you on social platforms 24, seven versus like, I didn't have that experience growing up. I didn't have that experience until I was like 25, you know, so, um, so maybe there is something pre your point about that. Um, the almost there is not much of a difference as you know, people spend so much time online. This is where you're having your social engagements is where you're having your conversation. So it does shape the way people think about, you know, their experience of, of what it means to have a conversation and what it means to speak freely. I think that's one of the interesting, uh, you know, it doesn't help that the um, but free speech has sometimes in many cases become a Figley for I want carte blanche to, you know, say all kinds of mean shit to people all day long.

Speaker 1:          01:53:08       No consequences. Yeah. They think they should be able to do that cause that that falls into the blanket of freestyle. Um, there's also an issue I think with young kids today that have smartphone addictions. People today I should say, I forgot young kids. How about me? Humans with smartphone addiction and when you're online and when you think about the majority of your interactions with human beings, but there's a lot of folks that are on their phone eight hours in a day. That's probably me. But think about those interactions. That's a shocking number of interactions with people that you're not even direct physical, the presence of your, you're, you're not looking at them. You're not, you, you're not waiting for them to talk. You're not considering what they're saying in our reading, social cues, all the things that make us human, those are all thrown out the window. You're just looking at text and it might be coming from Russia, the texts that you're getting upset at in responding to mean per year research. Really there's a direct possibility. It's not even a fucking person or a person, but not, not really representing their actual thoughts. Just trying to push your buttons.

Speaker 2:          01:54:15       Yeah, no, that's true. It's a, it's not even Russian trolls. It's just the, um, the amount of, I think it really is, we're in the unique time work. It's hard to know who you're engaging with. It's hard to gauge whether it's good faith. It's, I mean, I, I react sometimes where I'll see a response and go click into the person's feed to try to decide if I should take this as a seriously good faith inquiry or if it's like a, like a, you know, kind of vaguely cloaked. Fuck you, you know? Right, right. You don't have to do that when you're in person. It's a very different and very different experience.

Speaker 1:          01:54:51       Yeah. I have a friend of mine who's a, a young, single male and he was going through his direct messages and uh, these girls were sending him all these naked photos and videos and uh, he's like, look at this man. I go, let me see your phone. And I said, let me click on that link. I go, she has one picture on her page. Right. You fucking dummy. This is probably not even a person. Like, who knows what this is. Someone from Nigeria is trying to get your credit card information. Yeah. Cat Fishing. Yup. Yeah. I mean, they're trying to get you and he's like, oh yeah. Like, wow. How do you did not go to her page? Cause I had just, you know, I thought it was a girl send me naked pictures. Just, yeah, they just do that sometimes. Well they definitely do do that sometimes, but I mean, people are weird. They do all kinds of weird things. But you know, there's, there's a lot of these fake accounts and I don't know what they're trying to do. They're trying to get money from people or

Speaker 2:          01:55:41       that does come up. I've seen 'em every now and then, uh, if you follow reporters on Twitter, particularly ones who have like open dms, I'll periodically post the insane catfishing, you know, stuff that they get where it's like all about money or I don't have, I don't know. I, God bless people who have opened dams. I don't know how they do. It makes me glad I'm not a journalist. Yeah. So overall, are you happy that you got into all this? Does this, does this change your perceptions on communication? I feel like there's, I have tried over the years, whether it's conspiracy theorists, communities are terrorists or, um, or, uh, you know, Russia, Iran state. The state sponsored actors, the domestic ideologues. Um, I have tried to always say like, here's the specific kind of forensic analysis of this particular operation and then here is what we can maybe take from it and make, make changes.

Speaker 2:          01:56:45       Um, we've, we've seen some of that begin to take shape. And so I feel grateful to have had the opportunity to work towards connecting those dots and work towards having this conversation. I'm meaning meaning helping people understand what's going on. I think I am not, I am most concerned about the, as this gets increasingly easy to do through things like chatbots. Um, you know, now there's these, um, you've seen the, uh, the website, this person does not exist.com. So it's a, there's a technology called a machine learning technique, generative adversarial networks. And they, um, it's these basically there in this particular application working to create pictures of people, faces of people. And so this website is, when you go to it, it pulls up a, yeah, there you go. So this person does not actually exist. It's not a religion. Yeah. And so these are all, um, these are computer generated.

Speaker 2:          01:57:50       Yup. So, and you can see created by against, it says it down at the bottom there. So these are not real people. And so we have increasingly sophisticated chat technology. We have increasingly sophisticated, like you're not going to detect that image somewhere else. That old trick of like right click and look and see if you're talking to someone with a stock photo that goes right out the window is stuff like this gets easier and easier to do. Deep faking the deep fakes on the video front. I think that it does change. I think we haven't quite adapted to what is it like to live in a world where so much of the Internet is fake. And I do think per your point about identity that there will be groups of people that self select into communities where identity is um, mandatory. You know, we're, we're, this is who you are and you have some sort of verification versus people who choose to live in the world of, um, you know, drink from the fire, take it all in and try to filter it out yourself.

Speaker 2:          01:58:43       Um, so we look at these evolving technologies and I don't necessarily feel particularly optimistic in the short term. I think that ultimately it does, like we change as a society to a large extent. And in response to this, we think about, um, you know, they're going to be some fixes that the platforms are gonna be able to undertake. They're going to be, we're going to get better at detecting the stuff. Maybe, you know, the adversary will evolve. Hopefully we get better at detecting it as it evolves. But it's, I think we fundamentally ultimately change. Like people become more aware that this is a thing. They are more skeptical, uh, that does change are there are ways of interacting with each other. Uh, but I, I feel like that is going to be the direction that this goes. There's the more like, you know, the thing that keeps me up at night would be more the, um, the ease of, of turning this from a social media problem until like a real world war problem.

Speaker 2:          01:59:46       Meaning, um, as an example, back in 2014 when the first thing is internet research agency dead, September 11th, 2014, they created a hoax, um, saying that isis had attacked a chemical plant down in Louisiana and it's called the Columbia, the Columbia Chemical Pr. Um, plant hoax is, I think there's a Wikipedia article about it now. But what happened was they created a collection of websites. They created fake CNN mockups, Twitter accounts, text messages that went to local people, radio station, Collins, you name it, everything to create the impression that a chemical factory had just exploded in Louisiana. And there was some attribution to isis. And this was done on September 11th. So this is the kind of thing where this actually did go viral. Like I remember this happening, not as a social media researcher. I just remember it actually being pushed into my social media feed. So you have these, um, and we didn't know that it was the Internet research agency for year and a half after.

Speaker 2:          02:00:45       But this is the kind of thing where you look at parts of the world that aren't the u s like the recent, um, drama between India and Pakistan. And you can see how these kinds of things can go horribly, horribly wrong if the wrong person is convinced that something has happened or if there's a, you know, or if this leads to our riot or if this leads to real world action. I think that's, um, one of the main fears. As this gets better and better, the video fakes get better, the people fakes get better. What, you know, what do you do then? So,

Speaker 1:          02:01:20       yeah, what do you do when you see those images, those images, fake images. Those are stunning. They're so good. I mean, it just makes you wonder, I mean, and we're going to get to a point where if someone's not in front of you talking, you're going to look at a video. You're not going to have any idea. You know, they're doing those deep fakes when were famous faces and they put them in porn films and it's, it's stunningly good. I mean, it's a, it's amazing. And they're there. They're also with someone like me, I'm fucking doomed because there's thousands of hours of me talking. I've said everything. Yeah. So you could take this new, uh, there's this new product programs that are editing audio and you could splice together audio and video. Now did I even splice it? The computer will generate, yeah, just, it's insane. It generates your lip movements, everything. I mean, it's really stunning. It's really stunning. And it's only gonna get crazier and crazier and it's going to be very difficult to, unless something is actually happening right in front of your face, it's going to be very difficult to be able to differentiate. And then I'm more worried about augmented reality and virtual reality and this stuff making its way into it. And when we're going to dive w w willingly with a big smile on her face into the majors.

Speaker 2:          02:02:32       Have you watched that recently? No, I haven't. I watched that on a plane like a month ago or something. No, it holds up really well. Top, like it's, it's insane except for the, um, except for the phone boots and so on. One thing where like there's no fun was anymore, but everything else is um, wow. Yeah. It's, it's, I don't know you as you've seen it recently. I just bought it on four k cause like I forgot and 99 there wasn't barely HD back then and I just wanted to see what it was like rewashed it forgot how good it was. And two, two and a half hours flew by the whole movie.

Speaker 1:          02:03:05       Yeah. It's, it's amazing how that seemed preposterous in 99 or whatever it was like, oh, this is just psi Phi and now you're like, hey, this is a little closer. Like the idea of have you messed around at all with like HTC vive or Oculus?

Speaker 2:          02:03:25       I, I tried, I was a VC briefly like back in, back in, um, five, six years ago now. And I tried one from, um, I think it's USC, right? Those southern California has a bunch of really good labs down here. And I tried one where it was like a Zombie holodeck simulator and it was, um, it wasn't just the Vr, it was also, it was immersive. So they had a backpack on me. Um, and it was, it was actually scary as hell. Yeah. I was like, this is really good. This is, I like, I love first person shooters. I think there's so much fun, but this was just the first time or in the, in the game you have like a bat or something and you're your lecture of beats on piece together with the band and they're like all up in your face. And um, I don't know if that thing ever came to market, but Dan was a good too. Well

Speaker 1:          02:04:09       they have a company called, it's called the void now and they have this a wreck it Ralph one and I did it with my kids recently and you put on a haptic feedback vest and you go through this environment and it's crazy. I mean you're, it's very clear that you're in a video game. It doesn't seem real, but it is so much better than anything that existed five years ago. And you go, okay, well what is with the exponential increase in power of technology, what does this going to be like 10 years? What's it going to be like in 15 it's going to be impossible. Differentiate cause now it's a vest. It's just a vest and not strapped into a chair. He can move around. So you're going through this whole warehouse that they have set up for these games and even picking up physical objects and they look different in your hands than they do when you, when you look at them without the headgear on centers for that, they have them.

Speaker 1:          02:05:00       I haven't been to, they have one outside of Disneyland. It's in Disney, downtown Disney. It's called the void. And then you go into these, this one star wars one is a wreck it Ralph one now they have them in malls, small ones. You sit in these little eggs and you go on rollercoaster rides and you fight off zombies and go into a haunted house. It's getting weird and it's just that we're, we're, you know, I was a kid when video games were these ridiculous Atari things. We stuck cartridges in and you're playing pong and now we're looking at something that you're looking at these images of people you see pores you see there, you see the, the glistening of their lips, you see their eyes. It's, it's very strange. It's very strange to think that those are not really people and that we are probably going to look at the, all you have to do is create something that is so large and the propaganda, the so terrifying that it causes you to act without double checking, triple checking and making sure you verify the fact that something has really happened and then it sets into motion some physical act in the real world that you can't pull back.

Speaker 1:          02:06:08       Like, and this is does not related necessarily, but what happened with Hawaii when they got that false warning that nuclear missiles were headed their way, he imagined it was crazy and it was just someone hit the wrong button. I mean if we come to some sort of a point in time where someone does something like that on purpose and shows you video that you really think New York City just got nuked and you know, you have to head to the hills and there's a giant traffic jam on the highway and people start shooting each other. I mean, if, if Russia really wants to fuck with us what they're doing now with just this, you know, this IRA agency and all of these different trolls that they've got set up to sort of trying to get people to get being conflict with each other. This is, this is with primitive crude text and memes.

Speaker 1:          02:07:09       What could be done in the future. It's terrifying, but live in a weird world. Yeah, we're in agreement. Yup. Let's end it there. All right. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. Thanks for coming down. It was, and thank you for all your work and exposing all this stuff. It's really, really interesting and terrifying. Uh, tell people how they can get ahold of you so they control you on Twitter. My handle is at no upside, no upside. And you don't necessarily have an Instagram. It's more like family. My instruments, my kids. Yeah. All right. Thank you Renee. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Bye everybody.
