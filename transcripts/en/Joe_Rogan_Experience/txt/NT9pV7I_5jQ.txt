Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Ladies and gentlemen, what the Fuck's going on? So this up. I'm sorry for the late start. We were all fucked up. We had a, we weren't all fucked up, but the cam is all fucked up. That a problem with the Webcam, but we're is high right now and I'm back from Abu motherfucking dobby son. That was very strange.

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       Scary at all. It's scary. It scared me, man. I mean it's A. I mean it's real safe and it's real western over there. But the bottom line is that place is the first time when we were done the first time he muted the live preview. Yeah. So we don't hear ourselves. But um, we uh, we got over there and it's very strange. First of all, we're at a place called Yas Island, which is a manmade island. They said, which means they built an island. Isn't it sinking? Is that the one that's the one in Dubai, the ones you buy the sinking is the one. They have a model of the world. If you ever wanted to know how much money is an oil, right, you gotta go to the Middle East. I'm sure that it's fucking staggering. Really. I didn't see a shitty car while I was there. Everything was a fucking Mercedes.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       It's a Mercedes or A. I guess the cabs are kind of crappy, but it's all for robberies and lamborghinis and these fucking buildings. They built this island. Okay. And then they have this thing called Ferrari world and that's where the UFC was, which is this crazy theme park. They're building. They're just building shit constantly. Everywhere you go. They're building, you know, like all throughout the city of Abu Dhabi. It's all just skyscrapers and cranes and shit going on constantly. Apparently Dubai's buys even crazier. I didn't want to fuck around with Dubai dough. I didn't even want to fly in there. One of them, one of the options was we could fly into Dubai and then from Dubai we would take a car service that would take us a dress. It's like an hour and a half drive to an island and I was like, I don't want to land in Dubai, man.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       I can't keep hearing crazy shit about Dubai. I hear crazy shit about people who got arrested because there was some sort of a visa problem, so they drug test them. They arrested this one woman for coding. She is. She lives in the UK. She has a prescription for codeine because she's got a back problem, got back injuries. So they arrested her for this and put her in fucking jail because she had it in her system. Wow. There's another guy who was traveling there who had a speck of marijuana on the bottom of his shoe. But if you look at the dude, that dude was like a roster. He had dreadlocks and shit and that does not fly. Did you vacuum out your suitcase on my God that I didn't smoke pot for a whole day to day. Crazy. That was out of my head. Yeah, that's shit.

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       Just that shit scares me. There's no reason to be put into that because I've heard too many horror. It's not a regular society. I mean it's run by kings and you know, for the most part they're running just like western democracy means most, you know, it's very clean and very safe and cops are everywhere and people are polite. But the bottom line is you don't have the same sort of rights you have in America, you know, we always want to talk about are dwindling rights and our rights are certainly dwindling, but they're still way better than what you'd get over in Dubai. Dubai, you don't get shit it a couple of weeks maybe out on the piece. Now they're in jail. That's where we're making out. And then they, they, they said you can't do that. We're going to put you in jail. So they don't have a problem with like, you know, like the ring card girl is wearing.

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       I was wondering because I didn't talk to anybody before, I'm like, what am I going to wear? This chick's gonna wear like dresses. Like how weird would that be if they had a world like that would've been awesome. Yeah. They gave me the dress thing, the, the traditional garb, and there was a guy who does my job for the Arab world. Very nice guy. Uh, his name was Muhammad and the, they call them husband and they call them Muhammad Rogan and uh, it's hilarious. And he, he does the whole outfit and when he does his broadcast, he does this traditional Arab where they all were. It's like a white outfit with like a black thing around your head and then a white headdress, I don't know what's called but everyone. Whereas there did it smell okay over there dude, it's a bunch of rich people with crazy money and weird outfits, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       And I kind of liked the outfit for certain. This is what I liked about the outfit. I like it because like you can't, I mean I guess you could wear like a big watch or something like that. But like stylistically everyone looks the same and there's something about that. Something about that is dumb. It's like you should be able to dress and look however you want, but something about that is kind of cool because it's like, is it really fucking important what you wear? It's not, it's like it's in your head, it's nonsense and all this style and like how you want to be portrayed. Like have you ever seen a dude who like wants to be thought of as like a writer, you know, wants to be thought of as like an intellectual. She's wearing like a jacket with the Elbow Jack. Carol whack.

Speaker 2:          00:05:05       Yeah. Or that. It's like just a certain amount of like pretense that comes with what you were, you know, that's unavoidable. You know, I dress like I'm fucking 20 years old. I mean I'm 42 fucking years old. I still dress exactly the same. I did when I was 20. If you look at my wardrobe when I was 20 and now the only difference is I have more clothes now. That's it. And I have a lot of tap out shit. But other than that it's I fucking dressing same. I, I, there's something about wearing that outfit that they're all in unity to. It's like they all recognized like we're all in this together, like we all have the same outfit on. I mean part of it is like, it's got to be bad for like creativity and individuality and stuff like that because one of the reasons why people in America are so creative is [inaudible]. If you want to, you could put a lip ring in and fucking shave half your head and paint the other half purple and Tattoo your face. You can do whatever the fuck you want over here and something about that as good for creativity

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       to the point I understand, but also I've had jobs where I've had to have a uniform and was so much better having a uniform or wearing the same as everybody else instead of having to like pick out a different tie every day and every day for work.

Speaker 2:          00:06:11       Yeah, that is true, but if you had to choose when you're working between having a uniform and not having a uniform, you're always going to say no.

Speaker 3:          00:06:18       No, I don't know. That's what I was saying. I think I like having a uniform at work because then kids, you have to dress up, right? What if you could drag a real job, and I'm talking about real world, real world in the real world. We live in a fake.

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       It's not a no. That is another thing though about the world is that the world is so. It's so God damn rigid and what you're supposed to wear and high supposed to behave and how you're supposed to dress like Jesus fucking Christ. Like what? That's the best way they have of controlling people really is to make sure that you're always going to wear suits and ties when you go to work and that you know, you can't get into this place because you have a hat on and you know,

Speaker 3:          00:06:53       I hate the hat on thing. So silly that. I mean because I could understand where like you're in some parts where you're like, oh, that guys might get mad at the other guy because they're in a different gang or something. Or Gotham. Take your hat off. Yeah. They wanted me to take off my hat and I was with you at a comedy

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       club and he works for me. It was ridiculous. It was, um, we were, uh, at um, what, where the fuck was it? Well, that's the most ridiculous one. Strip clubs or another ridiculous thing that happens too. If you go to a strip club, they tell you to take your hat off now. What did they tell you to turn it around? That's my other favorite. If you were in it like I'm wearing sometimes. So can you please turn your head around sir? Yeah. Because like, oh, now you got me now.

Speaker 4:          00:07:32       Normal. One of the funniest things ever. This is 100 percent true story. My ex fiance and me went to a bar once and they, we drove all the way to oxnard or something like that and we get there as a friend's birthday and they're like, sorry sir, you can't come in. You don't have a collar on your shirt. And I'm wearing a tee shirt. I'm like, what? We drove an hour and a half to get here for a friend's birthday. And you say I can't come in and it was like all the stores around it were closed because it was ochsner at nine at 9:00 PM. So I went to my car to try to find a shirt and only thing could find is my ex fiance shirt and it was like a small little tiny collared shirt that he wore for work. Right. So I was like fat man putting on this shirt. It wouldn't even fit it look like that old Chris Farley like fat man in the jacket thing. Like I couldn't button it up and it had a color this and I put the collar up and I seriously walked up to the door like this and I'm like, hi color shirt. Can I come in? And you're like, yeah, I guess so. They let me in wearing just a great tee shirts. I now look like a fucking freak walking around the Bargo Hey, can I get a bug light and stuff. Lead is the collared shirt story. Like

Speaker 2:          00:08:37       what? What the fuck is that about? Why? Why is it collar boat and no color? I don't know. Especially, wouldn't you just be like, alright, you know what, just take off that. Just go in. So ridiculous. The thing about, uh, the Middle East is that you don't have to wear that outfit. When they gave me the head dress, they gave me one. When I got there I was like, okay, am I going to do I wear this when I'm here? Like that would be hilarious if we did it like that. Me and Mike both work, but no, nobody had to wear it but you know, it people were and some people don't, but a lot of people do when you go to the mall. So like I'd say like 30 or 40 percent of the people were wearing it. Wow. It's weird. So like, do they look down on people that don't wear it?

Speaker 2:          00:09:14       Like I don't know. I do get more trouble if you wear normal clothes. I want, that's a good question. Yeah, maybe. Right. Or maybe getting more triple where that shit because you're right. Fuck up the whole scene. Right? Blow on the curve, man. I think it'd be great because they would feel like you're wearing pajamas everywhere, just be naked underneath it. It's probably something to do with the heat, you know, because it's a really light thing and it doesn't stick to you and it, you know. I don't know. I guess they're probably naked under it if you want them to. Yeah, if you want it to be naked under that, that actually pretty dope. Yeah, probably perfect for that kind of weather flapping around ball sweat, hitting your shoe to it. It's hot as fuck over there and I don't even think we're in the summer, but there's first of all the billions of mosquitoes there.

Speaker 2:          00:09:55       We got lucky and we didn't get hit, but they said you can get, you can get fucked up like a swarm of them like swarm on you and you'll get like a thousand bikes all over you. There was wasps that were flying around the cage at that big. I was freaking out because it makes you realize like, oh yeah, like we're in the fucking Middle East. You know what I'm saying? We're like east of Africa, you know? Whoa. DC camels and shit everywhere. I didn't see camels, but some guys went and rode on camels and shit. Next sex and the city takes place there at my life. Really? Yeah. Those dirty bitches to ground over that. It gets Dick. Apparently. There's a tremendous amount of hookers and Dubai, Dubai's like hooker central. It's like there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hookers. So you go into like bars and clubs, they don't have clubs and the clubs are attached to a hotel.

Speaker 2:          00:10:46       So you go in the club, it's attached to a hotel and just you get, just get swarmed by Russian hookers. Wow. Because there's so many rich dudes over there and that's what it's all about. It's about rich students do in business and they feed off them and suck their cock and milk money out of them. Wow. And you know, get some cash. Were at the comedy store the other day and it's really hot. Chick was all over my friend Jason and the team and everyone was like, damn, he likes, she likes him, Blah Blah Blah. And then finally like, and he's like, groping her and stuff and he must have said something to her because at the end she goes, you have to pay to play. And he goes, what? And then he doesn't know what. And then she gets all right, nevermind. And walks away. And then this is like a half hour of presale that she did to him and no one saw it coming. It was like, wow, this, this is cool. How much money? I don't know. I don't think he, I think he just went what? I cannot afford cigarettes. But they are you talking about? Yeah, there's a lot of that over in the Middle East though. That shits. It runs rampant. Makes Sense. So many dudes with money, you know, they have the biggest building in the world is Dubai. It's a half a mile high. Is that the one that the

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       golf thing.

Speaker 2:          00:11:55       Oh, that's another one I think. I don't think that's the same one, but there is one with a tennis tennis courts architecture out there. It's just an amazing. Off the chain. Yeah. They have so much money. They have more money than you could possibly imagine, but apparently it's all dried up apparently. It's crazy now that so many people owe money over there and if you get, if you go broke over there, you don't go to court and file for bankruptcy, you know, you go to fucking jail, they put your ass in a cage. They put you in what's called debtors' prison. And debtors prison is a, something you really want to avoid. So when people are going into the hole, they just drive their fucking four hours to the airport and gone. Wow. So there's Ferrari's abandoned at the airport, like day people are constantly abandoned. The luxury cars leaving their houses, you know, they show up to, to collect money and there's no one there and they're gone. They moved to Africa, so it's been good, nutty, bad. But uh, they have nobody. Shit like a indoor ski facility. Like you can go skiing and doors. That's about, as I've seen this before, apparently it's, you have to see to believe how big it.

Speaker 3:          00:12:57       Right, right. It's actually like a, there's a picture of it. We could probably, somebody could probably Google it where it's just like a huge, like slope and it's like a diamond all the way down. It's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:13:08       Go surfing indoors to somewhere there. What'd you do? I still don't personally. Yeah. Um, yeah. So anyway, so that was what the Middle East was like. It was. People were very friendly over there. Food was fantastic. You know, the hotels, top notch. It was only, well I guess there were some people that were there that weren't there for the fights, but not, it wasn't crowded.

Speaker 3:          00:13:29       What's illegal? Alcohol. Illegal out there.

Speaker 2:          00:13:32       Alcohol, you don't, you can't go to bars but they have bars at your hotel, but that's the only place they have bars is in hotels. I think that's the law. You cannot have a bar, but you can have a bar inside of a hotel for I guess for Westerners, but they have like, you know, regular. The food was great, the beer was great. It's like a regular. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:13:51       everything tastes okay. Like it tastes like Cola and everything

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       as Arab riding on it. That's weird. He's taken some of that for what could doing for your scrap book, what are you talking about? What are you 12?

Speaker 3:          00:14:07       So that the arena was outside though, right? There was no risk to that. I didn't even, it was, was outside.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       And that was an interesting part of it too, because the first fight, uh, was uh, John. God dammit, I forgot his last name. He fought for the ultimate fighter anyway, and Mustapha Al Turk and uh, the first fight, these guys were so fucking slippery. They were punching and as they were punching sweat was flying off them because they were the first guys to fight. And so they were fighting like basically in the sunlight and it was know fucking a hundred degrees outside and humid and that, that had to affect their fight for sure. Yeah. They pace themselves, you know, and then they got through it. But, uh, John Madsen, thank you very much sir. Um, and the John Madsen, Mustapha Turk was a fight and they were so sweaty and every time they threw punch, sweat was fucking flying off. And literally like they threw water, like they were throwing cups of water at each other.

Speaker 2:          00:15:07       It was fucking crazy. So that's the. So that's the reason why the guy who fought Silva went into lay down the whole time. No, I just sat there and I got to talk about that. That's a very controversial fight. I, I, I rewatched the fights last night. I rewatched a Bj Penn, Frankie Edgar, and I rewatched a Anderson Silva and I'm Damien Maia and the Frankie Penn, Bj, the Frankie Edgar, Bj Penn. A lot of controversy on that fight. One of them is [inaudible] doug crosby, who's A judge who's a friend of mine. I like him. He scored it 45 to 50, meaning he gave every single round to frankie edgar. Now I thought it was way closer than his way closer than that. I watched the game last night in person. I was like, man, I don't know. When I saw it in person, I was like, look, the kid did fantastic. He definitely did better than anybody expected.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       Um, but the thing is when you're doing commentary for fights, basically I'm just kind of explaining what's happening, I'm sure to keep an italian my head, but what I'm concentrating on most is explaining things, being entertaining, you know, trying to, you know, trying to do good commentary. Not really scoring is done silently, you know? Correct. Scoring is done silently because you're contemplating what's, what's more valuable. I mean it's, a lot of it is subjective, but you have to contemplate, okay, a guy throws a punch and the guy, the other guy counters with a leg kick. Which one was harder? Which one? You know what I'm saying? It's like, who do you give it to with some people give the punch to it, some people will give the leg kick and in that case I could see how it would be closer, you know, then then I thought it was when I watched it last night, but when I watched the last night, I thought it was three rounds to two for bj penn.

Speaker 2:          00:16:52       That's what I thought. I mean, I, I think there's been clOser ones before I, I, to me, I could have taken either way, either way. It wasn't ridiculous to me that he won, but 45 to 50 was ridiculous and the reason why I say it wasn't as ridiculous because like when I was calculating when I was watching it, like in the first round, he lands a really nice leg kick at one point and then bj hits him with a punch and bj hit him with a couple of other punches during the take downs and he had pj with a few punches and one of them cut him. So that probably affected people because bj had like a little mark under his face. So sometimes judges look at that and I go, yeah, he got the best of that round just because a little cut sometimes that affects them.

Speaker 2:          00:17:30       So you know, it's so subjective man. But then the second run I was like, bj's landed more punches. They're like lending more, frankie's throwing more and he's moving more. He's making bjj fighters fight. He's definitely making bj chaser. So you're going to take that into account. Who's, who's doing better there? Who's got better ring generalship or control the octagon while bj's, the one forcing the fight. He's chasing after him, but frankie is really avoiding too much damage, but I think the cleaner shots were landed by bj and then as it got into the later rounds, dennett seemed like frankie, the only round that was really clear to me, it was the fourth or the fifth round rather. The fifth round was clear. That was all edgar. He took him down. He landed some real good shots. It was a good round. It seemed like around for him where where bj was fading every other round, but the fifth was like, man, who fucking knows?

Speaker 2:          00:18:18       Well, it's kind of like if you see a fight at a cafeteria, you're not talking about the first five minutes of a fight. You're talking about what that the end of the fight is dominating. And that's a very good point. That's a very good point. And you know what? A lot of people feel like fights should be scored that way, that they're different than, than any other sport. And at the end really is what matters because they'd been imposing their will on each other and here's the end result. The end result of 25 minutes of imposing their wills with frankie edgar was kicking bj's ass, set them down. He led, kicked him. He was moving better. You know, he, he in the end, you know, bj chased after him with a very few final seconds, but he knew that it was the final seconds. I would love to hear bj's, not the type of guy to make excuses other people.

Speaker 2:          00:19:00       That's true. Vaseline. Well, but that might've been true though. Let's be honest. It was true. They rub it on the guy's face and you see, rub it on the guy's chest and rubbed it on the guys back. Just kidding. I know that's 100 percent illegal. And I love phil nurse. I think he's a great coach. I love gsp. Those to both of them. But you can't do that. I believe when they say that this fucking witch Dr. Guy tells them to do this thing because he explained it to me. He explained to me this weekend, it seems like total malarkey. It's like, you know, he's telling me that there's three minds. There's a mine here, mine here in a mind here, and there's pressure, builds up the chain and you have to release and you grab here and you press. You know why that works? It works if you believe it works.

Speaker 2:          00:19:42       That's why that works and there's a lot of shit like that. Like I know a dude who's a chiropractor slash healer and a lot of people swear by them and the reason why they swear by them is because if you believe that what he's doing is going to heal you. Your body has amazing ability to heal itself. Negative and positive thinking and negative and positive beliefs about your life are without a doubt, self fulfilling prophecies. You can decide that your life is awesome and your life becomes awesome. Now if you decide that your life sucks, you can decide that your healing and your heel, you can decide that you're not in pain and you won't be in pain and you can make pain happen, especially when it comes to like back shit and you know there's real injuries and people get in car accidents and fucking jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          00:20:24       You get your neck cranked. But there's also people that create back injuries to avoid their life, like they don't want to think about reality. So ah, my fucking back. And that keeps them from thinking about other shit. But anyway, that's why they do this thing where you press ahead and that's what that's all about. It's like some psychosomatic thing, but it's a placebo if, if, if you believe in it, man, it fucking works. So I would like anyone. I would like to talk to bj and find out how was he in shape because he didn't look as good as it usually looks. I mean he didn't look fat, but he didn't look as hard as he looked in the sanchez find the sessions feisty. He looked sculpted and this fight he had a little bit of a belly, like a little bit of fat on his way, so maybe he had an injury because he also didn't sit down and his stool in between rounds, which I thought was unusual. Was it him that had the thing you had a nice sleeve on and he didn't sit down in between rounds and which you rounds. He stood up and he put his leg up, put his leg up on the stool and they said that to him at one point in time. Bj, put your leg up, put your leg up. There you go. But I don't know what that means. It could be a cramp. It could be nothing. It could be.

Speaker 4:          00:21:26       It's that human and you just got done fighting. You're going to want to sit down and he can.

Speaker 2:          00:21:30       Yeah, I would think so. I would think so. I don't know what it is, but see he hasn't said a word about it, so I don't know. So I think I could easily see how someone could give that fight to frankie edgar. It totally makes sense to me. You know, and I said like when I saw it live I was like man, I don't know either way, but at the end of the fight edgar was winning the fight and like you said, that should count more. That's the way pride scores that the way to do it. They counted the fight as like one whole thing. That's how it should be. Totally. I totally agree with you. I think. I think fights are not like any other sport and that like there was a fight between rio shown and a brad blackburn once and brad blackburn was kicking his ass for two rounds and then the third and final round real children came on strong and he battered black is beat the fuck out of them.

Speaker 2:          00:22:20       Like really went after him and broke his nose and he had him running from him. Total domination. The third route. So it was so much difference between the first two rounds which are pretty close but blackburn was winning by, was getting his shots in but jonah and keep coming forward. But blackburn was kicking his ass but then the third real China just turned it on. But real lost the fight, he lost a decision because blackburn one the first two rounds and I said that's the first. See the clearest example to me of how someone won the fight but lost the fight at the same time. He wanted a decision, but he lost the fight. If it was a fight. That guy lost the fight.

Speaker 4:          00:22:58       Yeah. What's crazy about imagine two guys fighting and at the last second it got hits. A guy knocks him out right when the bell hits, you know. But in the other guy won because he was doing the rest of the fight better, you know? But if, you know what I mean? Like what if that were to happen, what if that knocks him out? He goes, no, no, no. Right at the bell though, like thing bam. Guy knocks out, you know the. Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:23:18       Oh, like after the break. Right. You know why you would say to the guy dropped his guard because he heard the bill.

Speaker 4:          00:23:24       No, no. If it was like full from that bank thing, bonk, you know, like

Speaker 2:          00:23:28       I think as long as he was already committed to the punch before the bell rang, right, it wouldn't be a problem. But you know, that would like some crazy last second buzzer shit. Right. Because it. Because liotta. But cheetah did that. He'd knocked out thiago silva at the, like after barbara and he put them out. It was like during the horn, I think going off or, or very close. Very close within.

Speaker 4:          00:23:54       Why don't. So has there been any talk about taking the pride rules? No, no, no.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       What? It's so hard to, uh, to reason with the people that are involved and just sanctioning. It's so hard to get things sanctioned. And the thing I've said before, people complained about elbows like this elbow, which is what they call the 12 to six elbow coming straight, straight down. The only reason why that was made illegal was because big John Mccarthy, this came straight from his mouth when he was educating the commission and they were trying to, you know, legislate mixed martial arts. The people in these athletic commissions were worried that downward elbows on espn at 2:00 in the morning can break bricks, you know, there's fucking karate demonstration. So they were like, well we can't have that because you can hit someone and killed them. Okay, so you can't do that, but you can still do this, which is more powerful. I think this is less powerful than this.

Speaker 2:          00:24:46       This right here. It seems to get more weight into it. It's a more natural motion. This is pretty strong, but I don't think it's as good as this. It's like hitting someone in the head like that is not as strong as hitting them a lot. That was like when you turn your body into something, you have more power and I think that makes more sense that this elbow, the elbow that jon jones broke brand and various eye socket with. That's the. That elbow. That's illegal elbow, but it's powerful as fuck. Like what? Why is the other one illegal? And this one's legal debts.

Speaker 4:          00:25:18       I kind of get it though because there is a big reason why the ufc used to be on an a vhs tape with faces of death in my. In my collection. That used to be shocking, like almost disturbing, like, oh, I don't want to watch because it was like this guy could die, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:25:33       No, I definitely agree that there should be rules and I definitely agree this should be sanctioning, but it should be rational shit. It should be. I don't think you should. Soccer kick people in the ground, right? I don't. I don't think, but I do think that if a guy's on his back, he should be able to kick you in the face. Right? If you're on your knees so loud, you should still be able to kick you in the face. You're punching him in the face. Why can't he kick you? That's ridiculous. If you are one nay, you can blast someone in the face with a punch. Why can't he kick you in the face? You're trying to hit him. Well, you can't move as good. Well, don't be there then. That's ridiculous. You're taking away a a, an important weapon for the guy in the bottom.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       You should be able to up kick the fuck out of someone when they're on their knees. If that guy's trying to punch you in the face and you're lying on your back, it's like your weight is on top of them like you're stomping him. You're kicking from your back at him. You should be able to kick his fucking head like a soccer ball when you're lying on your back and a guy's on his knees, on top of you trying to punch you, you should be able to kick the fuck out of him and it should be much more. Put yourself in much more jeopardy. You're in much more danger when you're on top of a guy then, and that's how it should be because that's how it is in real life. That's how it should be. It shouldn't be this unrealistic thing where the guy has to be standing up over you for you to kick in the face.

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       No, it should be. You could kick them as long as you're on the bottom. Is there the bottom you can kick them and if you're on the top you can kick everything except for his head and that's what it is. You can kick a guy in the body when he's on the ground, you know you can kick the guy in the legs, you can kick it down to opponent. So a downed opponents should be able to kick you anywhere from any, anywhere. Who wants? It's legal. There's a lot of rules. I need to be changed though. Like gracie's never tap. Come on that last fight. That fight that he wasn't going to tap that. That's one of those fights though that I was like this. All right, there should be a cut. Alright. Fights over because there were so many times where I'm like, why is this guy even bother?

Speaker 2:          00:27:20       Let's finish with the frankie edgar. Fight that fight though because I think like I said, scoring is a very subjective thing. You could say the frankie edgar outworked him because he threw more punches and he landed leg kicks. He didn't learn that many leg kicks. Frankie definitely landed more leg kicks. He mixed it up more. Take down attempts so I could definitely see him winning the fight. I could see it being an argument because no one can say that. Their opinion when something's that close, you can't really say that your opinions right or wrong, but the fifth round he won. He won the fifth round. I don't see how anybody could argue that he didn't. But doug, this crosby men 50 to 45 minutes. That's ridiculous. That doesn't make any sense. He must've been drunk. That's why the reference should be done by a 100 people.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       Yes. I think you're right. I think three is too little and you know another here's another problem. Maybe the referee and should be done in some sort of an online thing where people they get picked. Absolutely no, like they get picked the the like posters on message boards. Guys who are big fans, guys who really, really understand the sport and we do it electronically. What's the. What's the thing that's a measures, a tv ratings and stuff and get a nielsen box. Something like that. Pick only a certain amount. I don't think it should be like millions of people means like that though. Your paper idea, but you know what the problem is, they all have to be there live to really. Then there's that too. There's that argument. There's that live is actually not as good. Oh, you're not seeing the whole thing. Not seeing the whole angles and you don't get to see a monitors.

Speaker 2:          00:28:52       You know, like when you live. Like when I'm doing commentary, I've got two monitors to my to my right and one to my left. So there's, there's all sorts of angles. Like sometimes we're looking at a fight and we're watching it live through the cage and write some shit goes down, they'll move in front of a barrier or they're moving in front of one of the polls and I can't see shit for a second and then I have to turn to the monitor or they're on the ground and from the angle where I'm at, all I see is one the side of a person's body, like they're on the ground, but they're on the other side of the octagon. I can't say it. So I have to look to the monitor, the judges don't get that, they don't get monitors. So these guys are just watching the fight as it's happening from the angle that they get and ever. And you know, I argued with the fucking, the athletic commission guy about it and he's like, well, you know, um, the, this is the, you know, that's why we have three judges. So they all have different angles. No,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       because you're going to get shitty handles, give them fucking monitors that they should have it like, er style, where the doctors are all above looking down at the fight. And we are absolutely. But the problem is even if above you, what you would really have to do is be in there and we can't have that now above with a monitor. The cameras are better. Really watching it, watching it live is better for the excitement. Like there's nothing that beats that excitement. It's fucking nuts. You know, and when you're there and you know, fucking, you know, randy coture is stepping in to fight brock lesnar and the place is going bananas. You know, that's, that's pretty intense. You know that you can't recreate that at home, at home. It's fun, but when you're there live, you feel like you're a part of history, like you feel like you're a part of some wild ass shit.

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       You know when shogun and machita fight in montreal in may, that being in that arena, when those two guys step in there for the rematch, that's going to be everyone in the fucking place is going to have goosebumps. That's going to be nuts, man, because they're going to know this is history, man. These guys went at it for five fucking rounds. Everybody thought machida was totally untouchable and then most people thought shogun one of the decision and now they're going out again and live and it's happening right now. Here we go. Watch it at home. It's pretty dope. You know, you get the commentary, you get the replays, you get, you know, get all the information, but watching it live to some special crackle in the air or your front row in the middle. Most of the time when I watched live, I watched the monitors, like I watch it while they're standing up, but once it's down I'm looking at the monitor and the floor. You're like right there and I'm only like a couple rows, you know, but still I'm watching the monitor being right there. It's pretty dope to be able to look through the cage. It's almost worth keeping that ufc job just for that. Do you ever get like blood splat right on your hit this weekend? Oh, you hit on my arm. One of the prelims is licking out of it. I told him, give us a hot water, get in my dna. It was a um,

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       it was pretty intense. Yeah, there was a, there was a lot of, there was a lot of blood and a couple of fights. The, that was in the um, uh, Paul Kelley. Matt veech fight. Matt beach had a horrible cut. He had a couple of them and just splattered they were right in front of us and they're beating on each other and just the blood went flying. So that's my take on the controversy on the frankie edgar, bj penn fight. I think frankie edgar, frankie edgar flawed a hell of a fight. It was a tremendous performance. So super impressed with them. Um, but uh, I'm not exactly sure if I agree with the verdict. I definitely don't agree with 50 45, but I thought it was a very close fight and obviously I'm not a judge so who the fuck am I to judge? And I definitely could see an argument for frankie winning it.

Speaker 2:          00:32:31       And like I said, he put on a tremendous fight. I mean really impressive and definitely one the last round. So if you look at it in terms of like we said, you know, someone that's the way it should be that though the guy winds at last round wins the fight. I mean he's the, they've, they've, they've imposed their will upon each other and you know, the end result is after all this time this guy's dominating the other guy, but cafeteria rules. Then there's another school of thought where you have to take the champions title, which I don't really agree with. I think the decision should be clear, but I think you go in neutral. I think when a guy's a champion, you go in neutral, you know, you're both go in neutral. And if the champion, you know, if you win the decision, you're the new champion.

Speaker 2:          00:33:10       If he wins the decision, he's a new champion. It doesn't have to be some crazy domination, you know, because that's what leads to like shitty decisions where a guy really does beat the champion, but he only agism and then he never gets the. You never get. Those are frustrating as fuck because you think he did it. I think he did it. The other problem with the frankie edgar fight, this was, uh, an interesting point is that when you're watching a guy who you think is going to get his ass kicked, right, a lot of people did. A lot of people thought frankie edgar was going to get, you know, bj penn is the greatest lightweight of all time. Frankie edgar got beat by gray maynard and they're like, yeah, there's no way this guy's going to beat him. Right? So people think that because he's doing well, he's winning like wow, he's doing better than I thought it was.

Speaker 2:          00:33:52       So they say, holy shit, he's beating him, he's beating them. But when you go back and you watch it, that's why it's so much more with so much pressure to be a champion. So much pressure. I'll never forget this. When bj penn beat matt hughes, I interviewed matt after the fight and matt said that he was relieved. Yeah, just all the groups were honest. He said, you don't know what it's like to be a champion and everybody's gone in after you. He goes out. To be honest with you, I'm really relieved. And I was really like, first of all, I was very impressed with his honesty. You know, that's a very honest thing to say, you know, when you're, you just fought and you're standing there covered in sweat naked in front of the fucking whole world, you know, like, I'm relieved. I just lost right now I can catch a breath, relax.

Speaker 2:          00:34:33       And then it came back and won the title again. Know. So I think he learned from the experience, but I think it's a tremendous amount of pressure for guys to, to fight and defend the title and to always worry about defending the title, especially in something like mixed martial arts. I mean it's probably a tremendous amount of pressure if you're a fucking a basketball team, you know, defending their, their world championship. But a fighter would use always guys coming up, they're gunning for you and every time you watch a ufc there's some new murderer who's head kick and dudes into a fucking coma and he wants to do the same shit to you and he's talking shit about you calling you a faggot and a bitch. And I'm like, jesus christ, you know, these guys get that. That's why they're so god damn sensitive. Is that what's going on right now with tito and adele, isn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       It seems like it seems like a fighting, fighting chocolate dough. Oh really? Not five chuckled though. Chuck liddell is going to be fighting rich franklin. And I can only say this because it's officially been released and was on the ufc is website. I can't say why. And they've been going back and forth on twitter. I've been noticing it. It's kind of getting. Okay, well that all all come out. What happened in time. I can't talk about it though. It's um. Oh yeah, that's what it is. So, um, anyway, that's a, that's that. Um, but you know, when, when dudes are defending their title, I think there's a lot of emotions at state and I think that's one of the things that people have taken to consideration with this anderson silva fight. You know, anderson silva, everybody's angry at him and every. And it wasn't very disappointing fight, especially because the first two rounds he looked like, like fucking Bruce Lee.

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       I mean it was like ridiculous shit. He was eat that flying knee that he hit him with the first round. You're like, jesus christ, she's just going to steam roll this guy. He's just going to keep doing this until this guy just crumbles. It's just gonna keep attacking at will and he's breaking this dudes will. It was totally humiliating. But I think that the emotion of defending the title, the emotion and the pressure of being regarded as the best pound for pound fighter in the world, I think that's an insane amount of pressure. I think it's insane. And I think when damien maia said shit to him, like I'm like take one of his arms home with me. You know, henderson got fucking crazy. So then when he was in there after the first rain after is kicking his ass and the second round is just start just talking mad shit and yelling at them in portuguese. I wish I understood what the fuck you.

Speaker 4:          00:36:55       It's not been translated yet.

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       Well some people have given a rough translations of it on the internet, but I don't know how you could possibly hear. I've watched the fight and I've turned the volume of way up. It's so hard to discern what he's saying because there's no microphone on him. He's not miked. Headphones, man. And the crowd is screaming, cheering, and we're talking over him. Right. So me and mike were talking like, what is he saying? You know when he's going nuts, screaming and yelling at, even if you have headphones on, I think it would still be hard screaming and yelling at a damien maia and I guess he was calling them like a spoiled rich kid or something like that. Like does damien miles like kim's for a better upbringing? I don't know what it was. Where's your jujitsu now is another thing that people are speculating who saying like, where's your jujitsu? Where's it? Bam. Then kicks up. Where did you get to

Speaker 4:          00:37:41       see? I didn't have a problem with it. Like I'm not on the boat. That gain is on and everyone else's on with it because I don't care about like a respect thing to me. If he can play fucking air guitar in the ring, you're putting up against somebody that's not. That shouldn't be there like that. If you put him in with our caprock that's just attacking him where he doesn't have a chance to do all this fun shit in the ring, then that's different than that guy just go into his back every time because he wants to get do jujitsu. I mean, he, if he doesn't want to, you know, he was laying on his back. He kept on going to his back to me. I was like to his

Speaker 2:          00:38:11       back as he failed to take down and he has to do that. He asked to fall backwards because if he moves forwards is going to get punted. He doesn't really. That's really when, when you pull, when you shoot on a guy and you don't get to take down. What happens is like say say you shoot the, a guy who tried to get ahold of them, he sprawls you have to follow it. When a guy sprawls he kicks his legs back. When he kicks his legs back, you have to follow his legs with your legs to try to stay a hold of them. Right. But of course anderson knew this was gonna happen and anderson is so much more explosive and so much faster than him.

Speaker 4:          00:38:42       Like, like I've always said, I think he's in the matrix. Like I think he's just seeing this shit. Like he can see something going on five seconds before it happens and then I think, all right, you got to get somebody that's in the matrix. Okay, but how come he couldn't keep up

Speaker 2:          00:38:54       doing that because he didn't do that in the fourth round. Fourth round. He got fucking pumped. The fourth or the fifth you got hit with a big ass lefthand, right?

Speaker 4:          00:39:01       Yeah, because he got stopped doing it because he'd heard what all that people booing adam and probably dana minded like got up and left or something crazy like that. He probably is like, alright, I guess I have to get out of this matrix for awhile and be somebody that I'm not fucking you. If you look how smooth and calm he was up to about the fourth one, then it seems like something happened between the third and the fourth. He was yelled at or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:39:25       You got tired. That's what happened. He got tired. We're outside. It's super humid. It's hot as fuck. It's first time fighting outside. It's, you know, he's gotten two rounds of clowning in right now and you know, I think all that energy that he, he expended, he could not keep up that kind of pace. He was winning the fight based on sheer explosion and absolutely, totally avoiding any damage, which is his style. But then he got hit when he got hit in the third round, the fourth round rather, I think it was a fourth of the fifth. He got hit with a big left hand. I think he shut down. You haven't. He was like, fuck this. I think he really decided like, I forget my, I can get hurt here, you know, like, and he's tired. Right. You know, so he just decided to keep moving.

Speaker 2:          00:40:05       I really do think that's what happened because the fifth round he didn't do jack shit, you know, and there was, there was one segment where he was standing over maya and maya was throwing bombs that I'm from his knees. Mine was throwing punches from his knees and mine was just trying to fucking kill him. He just couldn't connect to them. And in that kind of exchange, normally anderson just lights dudes up, that kind of exchange of guys coming and attacking and bombing and he doesn't counter. Why isn't encountering he, he's not, he's tired. That's what happened, you know? And now I don't hear a lot of people saying this. I think in the fourth and fifth rounds, I think he was tired. I think he was too tired to fight at his normal pace, which is his explosion inside and outside his speed that he uses. He's lightening fast math really dives in like that. He's so much faster than everybody else. And that's one of the keys to his countering. But when he got tired, he wasn't as fast anymore. He just wasn't. He lost a lot of esteem. And I think he decided to just coast. It was like, fuck it, I want this. Right. I'm just gonna

Speaker 4:          00:41:07       do you think that's his fault for being able to coast? It's a good point because, I mean brocklin, unless somebody coast for two to three rounds, neither would um,

Speaker 2:          00:41:15       fader fader would put a guy out, he would, it would find the guy and put a put feta or you know, is not afraid to get hit. Anderson never gets hit or gets faced, bust it up. And then the brett rogers fight like right on, like first round, first minute, he got hit with a big jab and his nose broke open. He had a cut on his nose going into the fight. Anderson never gets caught. He gets hit. He got hit more on the damien mind either that I ever recall him. He definitely got hit harder when davy there's, there's one, a animated gif online that someone found of damien maia stepping in and, and cracking silver with a big fucking lefthand and it really hit them square and silver wobbled and moved away and started dancing. That's the guy who got hit. That's it.

Speaker 2:          00:41:59       I was tired and got hit. I think he fucked around too much in the beginning. He blew a ton of energy. We're outside. It's humid. And then I think psychologically he starts thinking, what the fuck am I doing? You know, I'm acting like an asshole and screaming and yelling at this guy, and then he stand in front of the dude clown, I'm going to get cracked. And then I think he just decided to move. Just fuck this. See, I'm a huge fan still. I don't, I don't care what happened. I think he, if anything, he learned his lesson and in this shit, but I don't like all these people are like, you know, blaming him for this and I, I just don't see it. I'm like, why isn't the other guy, the other guy let him. I'll do all of this. Here's the problem. Here's the problem.

Speaker 2:          00:42:36       First of all, it was a historic ufc. He was the headline fight. And one of the goals of course, besides winning, winning is the number one goal for a fighter. But the other goal is to entertain. You have to realize that you're in a partnership with the ufc and the ufc sales paper view. And what they say sell paper view on is based on how impressive and exciting your performance. Yeah, but when you see, when you play easy and you just run away, you know, an attack, he could have finished that guy off in a second round. He could've maybe finished him off even in the third round. He had just put himself in danger and he's not willing to put himself in any danger and he's a well calculated fighter. I don't see the argument for that. However, for what he did in the fourth round and the fifth round, adults see an argument for because he didn't do shit.

Speaker 2:          00:43:23       He didn't attack it all. He didn't fight. He literally didn't fight. Maybe he couldn't, you know, I mean, he definitely couldn't fight the way he fought in the first two rounds and he's not willing. I think at this point in time with all the pressure on him being widely regarded as the best pound for pound fighter in the world, he's not willing to get an exchange. You get cracked. You know, it's got a tremendous use for, you know, I see the entertainment thing, but I also say, hey, is this entertainment part going? Make me lose this fight? Because if it is, I'm not going to do that. I mean, look, I think there's definitely some worry about that. I think he definitely was worried about, you know, if he was tired and if he was going to those fourth and fifth rounds, the only thing that makes sense to me is that he moved around because he didn't feel like he could fight at the pace that he fought before.

Speaker 2:          00:44:07       And when that guy hit him, he said, you don't want it. This isn't a game. I could get hurt here. I could lose and I would look completely retarded. So let's just around. Fuck this guy. I'll throw some faint, I'll move around. And you guys that have attacked him. Yes. He couldn't. The bottom line with them in mind. My has tremendous heart, but his striking is so below what anderson's is, the only way it's gonna work is if anderson's really tired and wasn't willing to stand in front of him when he's really tired. So who do you think silver can fight? That would just change the game. The guy would come in there who won't let silva do any of this shit. Good question. Some people say vitor belfort, but the problem with vito belfort is vituro has had some very uneven performances. Like sometimes he just looks like unstoppable.

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       Like against rich franklin, you know, against vandelay silva. He comes charging out in the first round. But sometimes I forget sakharova things don't go his way and he kind of shuts down and guys wind up beating his ass. Like he broke his hand into sakharova fight early and you could see him like totally shut down. And soc robin just kicked his ass, you know, and the randy couture torrified, same thing. Randy coture just broke up and got on top of them. It's just beat him up. And his first fight with randy couture and it's third fight, the second fight, but stop really quickly because it. Randy had a cut on his eyelid. Is eyelid opened up? Like it was like split in the it like he got greg glanced with a punch and then vito became the champ for one fight. And then when randy beat him up in the rematch, randy gun on top of him just broke them, you know, if, if guys put a tremendous amount of pressure on him in the past, they've been able to break him.

Speaker 2:          00:45:40       But the other, the other argument to that as he was going through a tremendous amount of personal problems back then, he's a different guy now. His, his sister had been abducted and kidnapped and killed and he was really devastated for years, you know, and that he's over that now and it's very religious and more at peace with himself and more like in tune. And his last few performances has been staggering. Like the matt lindland destruction, he destroyed matt lindland. He looked outstanding and then he came to the ufc and destroyed rich franklin. I mean he looks scary as fuck. And anderson, you know, did not want that fight. They were talking mad shit to each other and they were at anderson's manager was trying to say that victoria doesn't deserve the title fight. Like what are you talking about? He's the scariest motherfucker. One 85 besides anderson.

Speaker 2:          00:46:21       Of course he deserves it. I don't think they wanted that fight. I think the, you know, you, they can talk all the shit they want about him being weak and you know, if he tours week and he breaks mentally, he comes at you in that first round. You have to fight him before you break them. Okay. And before you break them, he's throwing lightspeed fucking barrage of punches like no one else in the business. He's scary as fuck. And if he really is a better, more mature person, if it really is more centered now and he's not going to break and really is like at home with themselves and really his problems in the past where he was going through a lot of emotional and personal problems. But those have actually made him stronger. If that's the case, everybody's fucked because that guy's a freak.

Speaker 2:          00:47:01       He so fucking fast. He might be the only guy that's faster than anderson. He's a counter striker and he's not as long as anderson. So anderson would have a little bit of advantage and a reach advantage, but goddamn v towards fastest fuck athlete John Jones, a freak to to put John Jones is two. Oh five. John jones can't make one 80 foot gsp versus silicon that ever happen. He was going to happen. That's what happened. It was going, no, they'll never do that. Now they can't trust anderson. Now they can't trust him to perform. And this is what I was saying before, this is why this fight was so important. This is why they're so pissed. Okay? Because the last two rounds, you know, him just running away the ufc his own 10 percent of his own by flash entertainment, which is the royal family in abu dhabi.

Speaker 2:          00:47:44       And this was like a huge showcase for them. This was like their big acquisition, you know, they're partners now and they're going to help bring the ufc to all these world markets all over the world. So everyone's all excited about this. So then they have this huge event where it's like a $3 million dollar gate, okay. For ticket sales, they have fucking ferrari world. They put it inside for our first outside thing. The thing looks fantastic. The crowd is insane. The crowd was awesome. They were so pumped up. Everybody was super fucking rowdy. Every fight was chaos except the bj penn, frankie edgar fight. That was just very close, you know, but there was some wild ass flights before the black. Brad, brad, brad, brad blackburn and demarcus johnson got damn kendall grove and Mark Munoz. That fucking fight was awesome. It was just not. The crowd is height to the gills.

Speaker 2:          00:48:34       Anderson silva comes in, they go fucking crazy. The new sunshine. We're in shoes. The music plays. You see him dance dancing. They're going fucking bananas and he runs for the last two rounds and dude, it was a disaster. Everybody walked out of there with their head hung, shaking their head going, what the fuck? Everyone was disappointed. It wasn't like. There was two arguments. Some people were saying, wow, I see his point. Why take a chance? No, everyone was bummed out what the ufc cells is just wild shit. You're selling wild fucking chaos fights the most exciting sport in the world. What anderson silva is selling is he's the very best at the wild shit and meanwhile he didn't do it the last two rounds. He just ran away. That's terrible for the business. It's terrible for what the ufc is trying to accomplish in other countries.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       It's terrible for the new partnership with flash entertainment. It's terrible. But have a ufc outside and all the fighters be added their helmet to it is, you're right. But it's even, they're both out of their element. Yeah. But they're also. I mean, that's just different, you know, that's like one who has fun and he was, he was fighting though. It was cool down. It cooled down to like maybe a seventies, but the first guy's. Yeah, john madsen and uh, and staff. I'll turn those motherfuckers fought in a sauna. Which you think about that gracie fight though. I, I thought that was awful. Well, hanzo hadn't trained for two and a half years. Wow. That's a long time. I said it didn't train at all this what he said in the post fight interview. And then he, um, trained for six months for the fight and it just wasn't enough.

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       Matt hughes for him, he had been looking to knock somebody out forever. So for him it was, it was an awesome opportunity to finally get someone who's going to stand in front of them. Wow. You know, like legs and. Yeah, he like, kicked the shit out of them. I thought it was going to take them down. I thought he would beat him from the top because matthew is, even though a kenzo has really good jujitsu, jujitsu is very underrated and he's just very, very strong. And his wrestling, I'm like, okay. We did the hoist when he got him on the ground, he doesn't land through voice when he got him on the ground. Yeah, he's strong as fuck man. And I just think, uh, you know, it had been more exciting if they went to the ground now there were both would have been in their element instead. It was like a sloppy kickboxing. He was bad. Yeah. It looked like ultimate fighter. Like the first episode. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, like the tv show. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's so much. They're mean, they're both doing things they're not good at. It's like you and I were going to have a one on one game of basketball. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:51:00       We pulled that.

Speaker 2:          00:51:02       It's terrible, you know, but you know, if they both had a um, if they try to take each other down and you know, and, and how to ground battle, that would have been exciting as fuck for matthew's notes. It was a smart move. He had an advantage standing up and plus no one's going to take him down. It's very tough to take that guy. But you gotta be like gsp to take matt. He was down so he wasn't gonna take them down. And matt, he's felt like he had an advanced standing, so beat him up. So that's what he did. He beat him up with leg kicks, slow them down and then eventually planted them. You know, I think matthew is still has a lot of fights in them. If he wants to do, there's still a lot of good matchup for him if he really gets motivated. I don't think he's gonna fight like that with that many people though. I think his decision to stand up with him was purely based on that. He felt like he had an advantage in that position.

Speaker 5:          00:51:46       It needs to change his opening song already. I'm done with it. Oh goddamn class. Now, because you said that your mother fucker. I'm just saying that you know it's done with that. I think my favorite fights are the japanese do. That's not fighting anymore of the ufc because he lost the last one where he dresses up and he has fun with the opening. Like the japanese guy. He is my favorite man when he's a fuck. I wish they would. There's no chance he's ever coming back to usc. Right. I'll really go almost still pretty young man. I liked him. He's one of my kids. Loves this song. Motherfucker.

Speaker 5:          00:52:31       A great goddamn song. So you never wanted to live in the woods like this motherfucker. I liked it the first 500 times I'm hurting. I don't give a shit when he comes out to that bucket to come on. Son isn't the greatest walkout music ever, in my opinion. There's no better walk out music and this song. No better match. Doesn't, doesn't. What's better? Come on son. It's perfect for him. Mix it up a little. I'm always about mixing it up. One a million fucking fights with that song. Yeah. Fuck you. It's grace on it. Plus the ufc owns outside. That's perfect. They bought the rights to. That's really because of the med schools so they can use the. The time. Yeah, they're. The ufc is fucking crazy. Is there any new kimbo fight versus montreal?

Speaker 2:          00:53:28       Um, may May 9th, ninth in montreal. Nice. Go. If you want to go. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:53:36       It gets fucking floor seats to the ufc. You have all you people out there that are like, fuck man, I would love to go. You can't even.

Speaker 2:          00:53:42       No, that's bullshit.

Speaker 5:          00:53:46       So, uh, I actually prefer it. Dude. I'll watching on tv. Yeah, you were to tell you. I bet you would if you were with it. We go to barney's beanery now. There will come a time where I will be watching it on tv. I'm not going to do this forever. Yeah, we go to barney's beanery. There's a tv at our table, a plasma right in front of us. There was like movie theater, have tvs. We got waitresses bringing us the joke for worst food ever beer. There's like 20 of us. I mean it's like I'm already. That's better. Right? It's way better. It is better. God damn it. You got to call in sick soon. I know, right?

Speaker 2:          00:54:19       I'm responsible for part of the entertainment part of it though. The talking part, you know, I would like to. I like watching it with commentary men. Oh, I don't. I would way rather watch somebody else do commentary like michael chavela or like michael chavela and goldberg got together and then like put a fighter in there like pat military or something like that. I'd be happy as fuck to sit home and watch that.

Speaker 5:          00:54:39       You stick it. Can't do it from your home. Like you know how like xm radio stations that they could do their shipping alone now to many kids just sit there with a tv and whatnot to interview the fighters. Holograms, man with a monitor. Real doll. That's what we like. What we were talking about before,

Speaker 2:          00:54:59       that one, they could replicate people. The first thing to do is replicate celebrities so you could fuck them. Yeah. So no. I eventually though I'm just going to just stand up. I don't know when it's gonna happen, but maybe sooner than later I'm, I'm not. I don't like all this traveling, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:55:14       That's crazy. That was one of your health. There's one thing that everyone was talking about, the borrow is at, is that there's too many ufc is now. Yeah. They were all talking about that. Really? Yeah. Were like, that's why we're coming here because I can't afford to ufc a month. Meanwhile the paper view numbers are still. Yeah, absolutely. There always be awesome. You know, the point is though, the more they do it

Speaker 2:          00:55:33       more grows and the more it becomes a part of the culture and it's 12 months a year and it never stops. I mean it really is. Gonna take over everything. It's gonna. You know, what's gonna happen eventually? I'll probably just do the vegas ones eventually. Yeah, just do some of them, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:55:47       or the la to la. They won't come back

Speaker 2:          00:55:49       very often. They go to la once a year, every two years or something like that. Say we've got too many places to go. We gotta go to fucking Germany and Ireland and Australia.

Speaker 5:          00:55:58       I don't have to be crazy. Well, the wec went to Ohio this year. I know, but why do you have to go to Afghanistan and why don't you just go to Ohio because they want to take over the world, you know, they want to take over the world. Look, they have a product that was very, very undersold when they first came into the ufc. The ufc had insane potential but very little coverage. Very few people know about it. When, when I first started working for the ufc was in 1997

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       and that the company that I worked for was seg, a much smaller company than the ufc. Now zuph. Uh, it was, you know, it was a, we did a lot of the same guys are still there. A lot of the behind the scenes gas. We did shows in like little fucking high school auditoriums and like doeth in Alabama and shit, like really small ass shows and we always said, you know what, this sport needs this support needs some fucking crazy billionaires who just loved the sport to come in there and just shoving in front of people's faces, put it on tv, spend a fuckload of money and make it huge. But nobody ever thought that was really gonna happen. But that is what happened with zoo fa. What happened is these guys had owned 22 fucking casinos happened to be ufc fans and they decided to buy it for fun. You know, let's buy the ufc. That'll be fun. So they get dana to run it. I mean, you'd have to be crazy to get that fucking guy to run it. You know what I mean? Think about that are really intelligent, but he's the perfect guy. The perfect, the perfect guy for it, but what other corporation would have us as a president or a ceo like that I fighting,

Speaker 5:          00:57:27       there are no other ones. You know what I'm saying? It's like you would go, okay, what happened?

Speaker 2:          00:57:30       Businessman who would step in and do it, and meanwhile I'm dana is just a nut and a crazy fight. Phenome. He's the perfect guy for the job. Literally, you couldn't get a better guy for the job, but you know, then they took over. But they realized when they took over, once it started taking off, after the ultimate fighter tv show started airing, they realized that all the sport needed in America was exposure. And this is a sport that transcends cultural boundaries, languages, it, it transcends everything. Traditions. Everybody understands fighting. You know, nobody's going to watch fucking cricket in America. You're never going to sell that. You know, you can try to make people think they're sophisticated. If they enjoy soccer or maybe you know, your family's from latin America, so you like soccer, but no one is going to fucking buy cricket. They're not going to buy cricket. But fighting, fighting is everywhere you can. You can watch fighting in China, you can watch fighting in Germany. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you understand the language it. I'd like watching the old prides when the, uh, I used to get prides straight from Japan and the commentary would all be in japanese. It was fucking awesome. Yeah. I didn't even know what that was,

Speaker 5:          00:58:36       but I will get knocked up, will go crazy. Screaming to japanese. It was fucking awesome. I didn't have to know what they were saying. I love it. I loved everything about party. Even the opening walk, I thought it was great. I did

Speaker 2:          00:58:49       pageantry. How the other giant screens, the dude's face on it and shit. I thought that was pretty.

Speaker 5:          00:58:54       I think it's fun, man. It's ridiculous. They had pyrotechnics for awhile, but then uh, uh, Joe Hill, de oliveira got burned. He got barbecued during one of the pyrotechnics. Mma tried to do right? Yeah. They have like live music bands. I can't rock with talking about elite. That was so stupid. Yeah. They had a band play a song. Auto affliction. Did that affliction. Affliction? Yeah. Of. Yeah. Those

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       silly fox. They had a band play a song in the middle of the fucking fight, like in the mid, in the middle of the show. Was he in the middle show? Were fights, fights, go on and then the band play and that's what it was in the beginning. I think that's what it was in between fights or something like that. So dom and you don't want to mix that. It's like people have asked me before, it's like open up for bands, like do comedy for uh, you know, we're gonna have like four bands we'd like you to go on in the middle. Do comedy doesn't work like that man. Nobody wants to see your comedy, whether in the groove to see music and nobody wants to see your fucking band. If they're in the group to see fights, you know, it's just like you can't stop a rock concert, put on a fight. You can't do it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       It wouldn't be as good. You know, you couldn't have like some fucking awesome rolling stones concert and then stop it halfway through the middle and have like an nma fight. People will be like, what is this? This is bullshit. What am I following? You, you only. It's, it's better when you only have one thing. One thing is good. These extravaganzas with adjustable, I hate doing like award shows to comedy on award shows because they have like all these awards and little clips and then you do standup in the middle of it. It's like, oh, the last time I did that was the guy's towards the ward for spike. It was disastrous. It was terrible. Nobody wanted to hear anybody's comedy. It was like the whole thing was like they were sitting there for three hours, watch some boring ass award show, so they wanted to just get the fuck out of there by the time I got on was.

Speaker 2:          01:00:47       Did you hear about that? Conan gail? Yeah. He's got to do tvs right before lopez. That's good for him. Both of them. For both of them. Yeah. I don't know why. I think it's good for him too. It's because they'll let him do whatever the fuck you want. Yeah, exactly. Ubs is going to blow up, not blow up and by the way has already rich. Right. He made so much money from that. Just leaving be, you know, I think even like 35 million bucks he can do whatever the fuck he wants. Now. Is tbs the same company as spike? No, I don't think so. I don't know. Just comedy central is comedy central and spike or that's why my, my special first year and I was black and then are on comedy central. Um, and you can get my that dvds available now. So go, go buy the amazon link on your website.

Speaker 2:          01:01:27       Yeah, it's on my way on joe rogan.net and it's on a, it was the number two on itunes. I don't know if it still is. Yeah, robin williams. What the fuck's hilarious. Did you ever go ahead of beto? I don't know if I ever been, but god, how could I don't get that? I understand how some people think some things, some things are funny. You know, there's some guys that I get that people think they're funny, but I don't see it. The robin williams thing goes right over my head. I just, I go, what are you laughing at? I have never laughed at him once. Maybe in a movie, you know, like whenever, something like that, when I was a kid I listened to stand up because it was raunchy, like he was talking about this deck and I was like seven years old watching hbo, you know, so that's the only reason I ever liked him. He never did it for me. And then when I heard he was a giant thief, then he's forever tainted. Like even if he says something funny, I'm watching him. He says something funny. I'm like, where'd you get that from? Another steal that from you. Fuck right. Uh, so, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:02:23       crazy celebrities. Do you hear about steven seagal? Steven seagal got arrested. He did? Yes. Impossible. He's getting, he's getting. Oh, I'm sorry. Just getting sued. He didn't get arrested. Andy dick is dick got arrested? Yeah. And did you hear about that? Walked into someone's house? Well he was also the day before he was thrown out of a winery in santa barbara for being too drunk. How do you get thrown out of a winery? Dr. Drew. You don't. If you're out there, I blame you. Uh, why do you believe dr to have enabled dandy dick? Sir? He was on sober house with dr drew. Oh, that's fine. I don't know. It wasn't dr silver house. Was that it? I don't think. Whichever one it is. What does it? Celebrity rehab was young. I had one of them. He was on celebrity rehab or something. I dunno, he's practiced.

Speaker 5:          01:03:10       Maybe dick. Maybe. I'm just imagining how rude dr drew. We're just kidding. Just kidding. Oh, fucking celebrity rehab is spectacular. It's one of my favorite shows ever. If you ever wanted like motivation to not do drugs. Watch tom sizemore on. What about that chick that, that. Oh, annoying was the crazy sex attic check. I, I swear to god, she's one of those girls that, that they shouldn't even have her on the show because it's just disgusting to watch. She's pretty gross. I actually liked the. Ended up liking the girl from that day was that she used to be on that old sitcom a that has the dog that died during the show. Uh, that wrote the book about being molested. Mackenzie phillips liked her. She's a nice person. She seemed cool to her whole store is a horrible.

Speaker 2:          01:03:58       Yeah, it is horrible if you don't have those stories. Mackenzie phillips. Dad fucked her like her whole life. She had a sexual relationship with her dad like her whole life and her dad shot her up with heroin or with cocaine when she was 11. Jesus christ. What a 11. And her. Her dad shut her up with coke. I mean, the whole thing is just the most horrific thing you could ever possibly imagine that someone would do this to their kid and fuck their kid their whole life had a sexual relationship with their kid. It to the point where she told her like, hey, we could leave. When you go to countries where this is totally acceptable, what country is he going to go to? What country is it acceptable to fuck your kids? Is there one out there now that should be just death? Jesus christ.

Speaker 2:          01:04:44       Nice to be death. Yeah. Well, speaking of death, the catholic religion is fighting to. They're trying to impose a statute of limitations on sexual molestation cases because right now there's a statute of limitations on sexual molestation cases. That's like, I believe it's like 30 years. So they're trying to impose a, they're, they're trying to make sure that that sticks. They, they want to make sure that, um, they don't, they don't change it to no statute of limitations because then anytime someone has a case right now, if a case is more than 30 years old, I think it's 30 years. Pretty sure the case is more than 30 years old. You have to, if you're going to be a part of a case, you have to be joining with other people that are, that are also inside the case. So say if someone has a case that's 29 years old and yours is 30 and the same priest buck to you, then you can join in.

Speaker 2:          01:05:37       But if yours is the individual case there, they're saying you don't want you to be able to sue. And people are saying, no, this is crazy. Crazy. And meanwhile, the catholic church is urging people to vote against this because they're saying that it's an assault on the church. How is pedophiles? How is shielding pedophiles with a statute of limitations? How has that fucking helping the church and how would getting rid of any, any statute of limitations that would impose a timeline for when you can be prosecuted for a horrible crime against humanity? How could that be what god wants? That god wants you to

Speaker 5:          01:06:13       sick of it. Joe, you know, ridiculous. Joe. I was thinking about today. I just got in a huge fight with my sister. I unfaced book or your sister. Let's talk about. Well, you can't talk about it. I can't, but I can tell you that I unfaced bucked her and because I on facebook, teresa, she's about to have a baby and she said that I could no longer be an uncle because I on facebook, but there's only two times be an uncle anymore. She's not allowing me. Oh, let's all stand would be an uncle to my daughter. How sure I am. I'm the uncle, his uncle. So anyways, there was a two times that I've gotten into such a huge fight with my sister. Both of these times. It rooted from religion.

Speaker 2:          01:06:53       Well, you know, I met. People want to believe that there are some rules and regulations to the world because it makes them feel better. And when you come along and say that they're not, that they don't exist, then it makes them. We have to reevaluate their whole life and they fucking hate it and they get angry at you because you're fucking up their piece. You're fucking. They have developed a piece of mine from the idea that god is great, god is good, and you do the right things. You're going to go to heaven like that helps them get through the day, man. And for a lot of people it's a nice simple box to put the world at. And when you

Speaker 5:          01:07:23       go fuck, it's a fucking box look, fuck. They want that box back. Then it makes sense. So the real problem is when anybody tells you that they know, that's when the problem came over. Game over, man, you can't.

Speaker 2:          01:07:43       You know, you don't know man. You're not dead, you're not in heaven, you're not an alien, you're not from the future. You don't know. Shut the fuck up. Don't know. Fuck it all, fuck religion, fuck, fuck. Any ideologies, anybody telling you how you can live your life. You know what? What is good? When people offer advice and people say, this is what I've learned from my mistakes and this is what I've learned from my life and this could possibly benefit you if you come across the same situations. This is what I've learned. This has made my life easier. This made my life better. I learned to be nicer to people. I learned to suck it up. When this happens, I learned to look in the mirror. When you

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       got problems, I learned to evaluate, you know, look at my own life. Objectively. Forest are pointed the finger at other people. Those are all things that can help you. When you start talking about, you know, you kind of have pork and I love this number. Here's a photo of mohammed is available.

Speaker 3:          01:08:29       Well, you must miss that guy keeps on getting threatened. He don't. He almost got killed, murdered the other day. The guy that, the cartoonist that drew mohammed the other day, he almost got like, it was like last week or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:08:40       People have been killed for that. People have been killed for drawing. Muhammad.

Speaker 3:          01:08:42       Why is trey parker and matt stone not dead yet? They drama humble. They had a whole episode about muhammad. That's a good question. This guy just had a stupid family circus

Speaker 1:          01:08:51       comic when I went over to, uh, uh, abu dhabi. I was thinking, I hope none of these motherfuckers have a copy of shiny happy gi. No sticking. I us thinking that dude my fucking seat, my last cd, not this one, but the one before that was called shiny happy jihad. Or they probably know that I have a copy of it. I'm going to start giving them away because I just got a box of them. Right.

Speaker 3:          01:09:13       Did your one cd is out of print? I still think the idea of. I had an idea. He has this odd cdd, can't do it. Remixes, remixes, remix the bits into like, you know, because they're kids, but they're gone. They got to go, I need a new sheriff in town,

Speaker 1:          01:09:30       but this is, this was what I was worried. If you don't not familiar with any of my comedy, it's fucking, it's called shiny happy jihad. And it's me. Can you see that was the just. There we go. It's me with fucking dmt and it says g on it. I mean, that's probably one of my best cds. I think it's my favorite. Uh, the last one is really good too. The last one's a little heavier. This one's a little sillier, but I don't know. That's one of my favorites. But I was like, god, I hope none of these motherfuckers have this because like half of the bits are about suicide bombing and fucking making fun of osama bin ladin living in a cave. I mean, it's a lot of, a lot of them.

Speaker 1:          01:10:17       Gee, there's a lot of that in there. Some guy remix that jihad and made a terrible song out of it. I still think you need to work on your new song that you wrote in tempe. I think that's a great song that he has a song. That's. Where was the Arizona? That was number one. Girls. Oh, that song, that song? Yeah, that's what I was really popular. But panini was like number one for like. Yeah, it was number one for like a couple of months because these guys, tim and mark in, uh, in phoenix. I love this guys there. They don't work there anymore. Unfortunately. If they got fired up, you probably don't know them. You're thinking of something that, you know, the ones that we filmed the original a dvd for like three years ago, four years ago. Would they then. Yeah, I filmed something for later. Well anyway, these guys, they started playing it. It's this cycle about pussy by booty pussy. It's called nanny. But you can play

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       it on the radio. It's like, it's pretty clean. It's all about any guy knows what this is all about. Like there are, there are girls' vaginas are not created equal. They're just not, you know. And, and sex is not equal either. You, you could have sex with one person and it's boring as fuck. And then you can have sex with another chick and she's just a goddamn freak. And every now and then you'll come across a girl who's a freak and she's got a super pussy and there are pussies. They're super pussies. Yeah. Where you, you get into any like god damn. There was this one girl that I used to fuck and literally her, her pussy was like, it was like velvet. There was something going on in there. It was like, it just gripped your dick. It was, she wasn't a small girl.

Speaker 2:          01:11:54       She was tall, but her pussy was super tight and always wet. And it was. And she was a, just a total pervert, just a freak. And literally it was like a drug. And I see, I used to call it voodoo pussy. I'm like, this page has got food pussy. So I had to write a song about udo pussy. So I wrote the song voodoo nanny, which is one my 1999 and cd, which is called a. I'm going to be dead someday. So, um, you know, I've thought about writing another song. I might write something else if I found something.

Speaker 4:          01:12:26       I like the new one, the new one that you knew. It was pretty funny.

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       Girl's butthole were high one night. I just started singing that and they got stuck in everybody's head and all night we were just walking around going to assume senior girl's butthole. I can't tell you what the subjects. Why this came up is this dude that we know was dating this girl that does some things where you might be able to see her butthole, like the whole world can see it. It's funny. So I like that guy now. He's a good guy. He's a good dude. I like that. Dude.

Speaker 4:          01:13:01       So you've been using your high tab a, what's it called? Ipad a lot later. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, definitely. How has the battery life did you use it? Dominoes

Speaker 2:          01:13:09       the whole way. I didn't charge it once. I charged it right before I left, but I was reading like with it every day, like reading in bed and uh, I was a watch. I was surfing the web on it. I was doing all sorts of shit on it. Man.

Speaker 4:          01:13:20       I have a review I just did and I showed this new application that lets you take your iphone and it bluetooths connects it to your ipad. It's like a wireless webcam. I saw that, but that's just like a shitty programming. Can you imagine if apple releases a. Here's what. Here's my. Here's my rumor what I think it's going to be. I just made this up last night. All right, so they have the new iphone that comes out in june. They're going to next. There's all this room are going to have a front facing camera with it chat so you can do I chat live video on your phone. So what? I think they're waiting for that rumor and they're going to release a bluetooth hd camera that will snap on top of your eye tab and do the same thing. So you can have like a little wireless camera.

Speaker 2:          01:13:56       Why don't they just have a camera built this saturday? Well I have to hit some bluetooth thing that's gay because in the bluetooth going to run out of batteries and how's it going? I'm going to have to charge it. That's.

Speaker 4:          01:14:04       Well, there should be an iphone camera. Why don't you make a camera in there? I think they're going to happen. I think it's going to be like a $300 camera. I think it's gonna be like hd, like high quality.

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       Just making this up. Well, I am not going to sell it.

Speaker 5:          01:14:14       This is definitely those. Jesus, this is going to go back in time. Can go back in time with that and it'll suck your dick while you take a.

Speaker 4:          01:14:23       That was awesome. That program alone just kind of made me go, you know what? Something like this is coming.

Speaker 2:          01:14:28       That's what's gonna happen. Eventually, eventually it's going to be like a portal to another dimension. There'll be a mouth on the other dimension. You get a hard on and you put the ipad and your dick goes right through the ipad to someone's mouth.

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       Another know in another dimension to pull your ipad out.

Speaker 5:          01:14:44       What if it crashes? Halfway through dick is stuck in the fucking 11, just floating around with it.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       Special episode of oprah winfrey. Gods who lost half their dick into another dimension. Maybe one dude is like, I only lost the tip. I was just about to put it in. We had a power outage. It was just about, I guess it was some sort of a solar flare and so now, I mean had the top of my degree

Speaker 2:          01:15:08       is flat. It's kind of a novelty goes into like a beer can. He doesn't have a head. It doesn't have a curve to it. Just think flat. Yeah. Who knows what the fuck is coming up next man. There's gonna be some crazy shit though. It's gonna. It's gonna. Keep going. They're going to keep inventing more and more nutty shit and like I said before, I think that it's all it. Everything has to do with connectivity. Everything has to do with bringing people closer and closer together. That's what this whole tiger woods thing is all about. That this would not have happened 30, 40 years ago because there wouldn't be the kind of connectivity that people have now with the internet. The internet keeps.

Speaker 4:          01:15:42       It's getting worse and worse. Man, did you hear what else has came out the other day that a fucking oprah winfrey. Oprah winfrey? Yeah, it's Jesse James. It's going to consist jim carrey, a good a whole article on this whole thing on gizmodo or mondo or whatever it's called, dot com. Moan about celebrities ruined. Enter careers from twitter and all that stuff because there's too much information is getting out and you know, it's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       That is a good point because a lot of celebrities, really the illusion is way better than who they are. Oh yeah. You know, you get to know them. You know, like it's. It is a trick, you know, most other sports in niggers, a trick obviously you know how few actors would ever want to do something like this. Fuck if they did that because look, look at us. There's no makeup. We're just fucking hanging on my office. Look, I'm a fucking slob. That's all my shit. I'm cleaning out my office. This is my, my new desk is behind me. I bought this fucking desk a year ago and I still have not set it up yet. The desk did. Everything's on right now is too big, so this desk, I'm getting rid of a moving that desk in the place and that wall is going to be a green screen. I always buy things and it's always in plastics. You have so many things that you've never even know. Well, I am what, what you would be like if you were 12 years old and all of a sudden you had money to. Somebody just gave you free money. Just buy stupid shit. But this, I have this because um, I think that, um, I think a lot of things up in my car and I don't want to be fiddling around.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       I just want to push a button so I got a digital recorder when I drive, I come up. Do you drive? You come up with ideas where you drive? Yeah, I do.

Speaker 4:          01:17:17       But you know what's funny is I, we talked about this last week to the point where like I have to get my words out as quick as possible. It happened to me like two days after that I had thought of this hilarious thing about metallica. Pete, we're talking about metallica and I'm like, oh, I get my iphone out, got my iphone out, and somebody says, hey brian. I'm like, oh hey, fuck. Lost it. You don't even remember what it is. I've been trying to think about it all time. Was so fucking funny though. I can't even remember it.

Speaker 2:          01:17:39       Yeah, it's when someone's talking to you and you have an idea, you can totally lose it. Like I'll get ideas. Awesome. I will cover my ears and run away from like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Man? You're fucking rude. Then I have to come back and explain to them I'm so sorry. I had an idea and it was super important. But for me any idea like that is like, those are diamonds. Like there's ideas that have come up with like, you know, that became bits, you know, that those pits are so valuable to me, you know, like, like, like my Anna Nicole Smith bed or something like that. Like some of the classic bits that I had in the past. What if, as I was thinking that up, somebody came up to me and started talking about their stupid bullshit, right? Because some people are fucking brutal and they don't take the hint ever. Like they just want to say what they have to say to you. You can't say, can you hold on, hold on a second. They'll just keep talking.

Speaker 4:          01:18:27       Hold on a second dude, stop. Fuck, fuck. And then I was watching the ufc next to a guidance. I just met with a friend of a friend, but the whole fight, he sounded like a reporter from the 19 twenties talking to dick tracy. It's like that. Anything about that yet. So when you think about that, I'm like, even talk like that. He's, that's funny thing about his legs. I think as long as I can. And I'm just like, oh, shut the fuck. We're like, I hate when people don't have that quality of self evaluated. You know what I mean? That just drives me crazy when I meet somebody that does.

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       How important is that? Uh, we know a lot of people that don't have that quality. We know a lot of people, most people don't have that quality. It's a bad quality, but in the usually the people at this is another thing that people don't have that quality are usually not successful and it's one of the reasons why they're not successful is there. There's a. There's a disconnect between them and other people. Other people do not see them the way everybody else does or them the way rather they see themselves, they see themselves like completely distorted and that's why they haven't been successful. They're not being objective because objectivity requires pain. You know? No one's perfect. Okay. Especially when you're younger, if you're not making mistakes, you're not trying. If you're not trying, you're not going to get better at anything you do. You're gonna fuck up.

Speaker 2:          01:19:45       You're going to make horrible mistakes. I mean, one of the reasons I got good at standup is because being bad at standup is so fucking painful, you know, and the only way you got to find that out by getting in front of people and having them hate you, having them not laugh and believe, well a lot of people don't have an audience in their life. They don't have anything to evaluate themselves with so they don't evaluate themselves. So they have this distorted perception of how cool you are. That's with guys and drinking. That's the most painful.

Speaker 1:          01:20:11       The mouse drinking. Yeah. It's your worst. And I've been, I, I made it, I've done it before, but I've also like the next day slapped my forehead going, okay, next time I drink I got to remember that I do that. I need, you know, I've. But there's some people, it's supposed to guys get really close in your face when they're drunk. Some dude did that in and other job and he kept telling me that he was some prince's cousin and this and that. And then men, you come with me, all the bitches, man. Come on, man. We're going to do business together, you know, it was you and I are going to open up. I like to get the fuck away from me. You're, you're spitting in my ear, man, and telling me how we're going to go into business together in dubai and like get the fuck out of here man.

Speaker 1:          01:20:56       We're not going into business together. It's chicken. My Mike Young used to do a joke about that was one of my favorite bits about how everybody does coke wants to open up a business with you because it's totally true. When dudes do coke, they always have business plans because they have all kinds of plants. All kinds of, oh, coke is the worst drug in the world. Is the worst drugs ever been created? It is the number one retailer drug. There's no better when you're out and you're surrounded by a bunch of coke cans and they're just talking out. Know the worst is when you're high and they're cooked up. Is there ever a worse combination? There's no worse combination. Then when you're stoned and you're hanging around coke heads because stone is like you're timid and you're humble. You know, when you, when you smoke pot, you all, you start realizing like, god, I'm like this fleshy little thing. You know, like if there's a line in this room, that line can just eat me. There's nothing I can do about it. When you're coked up, you never think about a lion. If you do like a little fucking line to that line of something like grade math is the worst somebody put on there also. Yeah, I agree with math. I wonder how many people. Yeah, robin williams was a coke addict. I wonder how many people,

Speaker 2:          01:22:03       um, but that I've been around have been on methadone. I didn't know it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:08       I bet a lot. La man, there's a lot. Half the people that we think are fucking crazy or just on math. A lot of people

Speaker 2:          01:22:17       are messed up, man. That is definitely true. A lot of people that are like, when you see people that are real skinny and drawn out and they're fucking talking wacky. It's something. What is it? It's some sort of amphetamines, whether it's math or do you know that meth was invented during world war one and world war two, the japanese used it for the, um, for suicide bombers. That's how they talked to kamikaze. He's into fucking crashing planes into boats. Yeah, they would. They would hook them up with meth. Nice. Yeah. That's cool. Not only the government is not only experimented with that. I mean they've done. The japanese government gave them amphetamines and crystal meth and shit like that. But I'm also steroids. The United States government has done that in the past. Like soldiers have told, been told that they have to take certain pills, you have to take things. And when you take them finance, like anna bar, which is an oral steroid, super hyper

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       aggressive, which totally makes sense. Yeah. And when guys are juiced up, if guys were all juiced out there fucking, they feel like they're invincible. You're, your body's all flooded with testosterone. Like gorillas must feel completely invincible. You know, when you're just fucking, you know, you're living in the woods, you're covered in hair, you weigh 800 pounds. They don't worry about shit. Take a totally beat a fighter by the way. Gorilla is versus a person. Oh, crusher person. No, I mean a person who would be the gorilla beat eddie. Eddie was trying to make some crazy argument that it was people that could be the champion. A fight. I'm like, what the fuck it ship would just bite your fingers off. That's the first thing he would do. Now try fighting stupid. Oh, you're punching him in the head. Good. He's grabbing it and eating your fingers.

Speaker 1:          01:23:47       So once you all have your fingers are gone, then he's going to look at you and go, now what? Bitch? Now I'm going to eat your asshole and it'll dive onto your asshole. It was. Wait till it gets close to your bundle and you'll be fighting them off where he get. Keep getting in there. I thought eddie was joking the whole time, but I don't think he was drunk. Not drunk at ease. You know? Drunk getting drunk. Drunk. He was drunk. Yeah. Sees three drinks and three drinks and this drunk eddie. What? Support that Jack Daniels. The lights went out in Georgia, fucking drum started playing. The indian came out.

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       So what brock would destroy gorilla. Could you imagine what a girl would do to progress? You know, just come charging across. I'm just. He knows he can't fucking be extra long. You ever seen a gorilla Russia person? It's so goddamn terrifying. They rush you and they hope that you're just going to back off and get away and they just want to claim your territory, but if you do turn and run, they might just freak out. Just chase you and beat the fuck out of you so you have to turn away and yet, but you have to stand down, but you can't look like prey to chimps, chimps and gorillas and we there are so strong we couldn't even imagine. You couldn't even wrap your head around what they could do to you. They could literally grab you by the arm and throw you throw you. They would pull your arm literally right off your body like no problem. A pit bull and killed those people.

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       Hippo. That's a dog. You remember frank have frank. I always used to think that if this dog wanted to, he could kill me. He could kill anything. Fucking 90 pound pit bull with his big fire hydrant head. If he wanted to, he would kill me. You know, he doesn't know that. That's why, you know, I have no food. That's why I like being around animals that can't kill me. Make an only love. Yeah. Like little kitty cat, kitty cats. So what do you think about the steven seagal? Thanks. Steven seagal. Got arrested or didn't get arrested? He's getting sued. Let's find a story right here. Because what happened was apparently he had some chick that was working for him and she was his. She was his, um, he's sued for trafficking women and sexual assault trafficking women. The woman was a former model and she was hired the actor

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       as his executive assistant last february. This was on tmz. So you know, it's real. Mr. Seagal had been keeping to young female russian attendance on staff who were available for his sexual desires 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So apparently one of the assistants quit and seagal apparently only roles with threesomes. So he made his uh, he made his assistant, starts laughing. He's like, I need more than one. He had two hookers that were working for him. Twenty four slash seven and one of them probably met some rich dude somewhere and got a better job. Fuck a cigar. That much money tv show now. Yeah. But that's not shit. He's done a lot of, oh, he's making money off that show. It makes the star. I guarantee you it makes a few hundred thousand dollars a year for sure off that show. Maybe half a million, maybe more because he's a big star.

Speaker 2:          01:26:56       He might make a million a year off that show. They might've given them a big deal. It might make more than a million a year. So he's got that. Okay. Then he's got. How many movies did he do? He did a lot of goddamn movie. So you got divorced in 1996. So everything from 1996 until now. It's all his money. I bet he's got a lot of money. I bet he's got a ton of money. It's money doesn't seem smart with his money. It seems like it's spinosa money on ponytail, ponytail, juice, juice. What does that even mean? Conditioner. How much has conditioner and he's got good conditioning. He's um, I mean he's, he's still a big star in those foreign movies, like straight to video, dvd sales because he could still sell a steven seagal movie, you know, you make it for cheap money and you sell it fairly cheap and they, you know, the air it on cable at 3:00 in the morning and they sell them on dvds.

Speaker 2:          01:27:45       There's still some money in that. But like when I said was when I was in a, uh, abu dhabi, when you go to dubai, dubai's flooded with hookers and there's hookers, airways, russian hookers. So apparently there's a lot of them. So it's not outside the realm of possibility that some actor, we just hired two of them like to be on call 24 slash seven. Right. I think it's, I mean, look, if that's how you want to roll, I think that's a pimp move. I mean, the dude's not even fucking married, right? You use, you can't really criticize it. I mean, you can criticize the fact that he's a, you know, he's hiring prostitutes, but let's be honest, what the fuck is, you know, a lot of rich guys, wives, what, what are they, you know, are they really attracted to them? Is, I mean, it's tiger woods wife.

Speaker 2:          01:28:28       Does she really think he's hot, you know, or do you think he's hot because he's rich? You know, how many of them think he's hot because he's rich? How many super goofy looking dudes that are multibillionaires who have these model wives. He's super fucking hot wise. What's going on there? You know, Donald Trump, you ever see donald trump's wife hot as fuck. Yeah, he's a powerful man and all that good stuff and they're attracted to that and security and all that good stuff. But at the end of the day, he is rich. They're hot, he's ugly. What's going on there? I mean, this is a form of prostitution, right?

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       It really is. Yeah. I mean, what's the sexual prostitution is the whole difference? Is that in sexual prostitution? So apparently, you know, the idea is that it's not good because there's no love, there's no real emotions, no relationship, you know, it's just sex for money. But like what if you like data girl and you actually enjoy her company and need your time and you like her and you say, listen, you have a shitty job and I have a lot of money. How about you quit your job and I pay you a thousand dollars a week and this is what you have to do. You just have to suck my dick anytime I want. I mean, you already liked to do it anyway, right? Well let's just make it sort of a job. Okay. And you'll get a check every week. But I don't wanna hear any argument from me.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       I think that'd be cool for like a year. But I think after that, I don't know, man, it's just, I, I can see myself doing that if I had a lot of money. But women would think that it's demoralizing and it would be the exact opposite of a, you know, why? Uh, why pay for the cow when the milk is free? Right will be the exact opposite. It would be like, look, I know I'm getting free melt, but I would rather pay for the cow and have that fucking cow. Give me anytime I want with no argument. I don't want to get up at four in the morning. Go to milk you when you start complaining. Listen, I'm going to pay you right now. And this is what happens with our relationship now is we're still friends. I still love you were boyfriend, girlfriend, but I do whatever I want and you suck my dick whenever asked.

Speaker 1:          01:30:16       Now you got the bank. Does that process but yeah. That. Is that illegal? No. Is that illegal? I would say it's illegal, but I would say that's not illegal. If you say it is it, is it on your tax forms? I'm, you know, brian reichles paid hooker. You, you go to jail. Yeah, that's illegal. Yeah. Say if you had a check to do it right, you know, you'd have to write it down. Mean look if you had a girl and she was a multimillionaire and say if you were a carpenter. Okay. And uh, you know, this is your, you know, you, you've met her and you used to do some shit around her house when you first started dating her and you know, you do a little carpentry here and there, but he did it for free because you loved her. And then all of a sudden she said, listen, you don't like your job. Why don't you just come from me, work for me. You'll be my carpenter and you just do whatever I want to do whenever you want. But the only difference is now a pay you. What is the difference between that and sucking your dick is very, very little difference, right? If you have a chance and she's working for you and she just gets paid to blow you, but she used to blow you for free. But now she blows you because it's her job because you pair, right? Is that bad?

Speaker 3:          01:31:19       No. Especially if you make it. Let her just let her make her dress up an outfit.

Speaker 1:          01:31:27       The old girl only giving my only whore. You. I only have one. It's only you and I don't fucking the other girl. I would hate, I would hate that. I would hate, hate, hate, I, you know, because I think the purpose, my purpose was always finding somebody that would want to fuck me that much without any questions asked in that I would want to fuck that first that I didn't give you. This chick likes my logic eve pull. She likes the logic. That's a dude. Sexuality has been immoral. Uh, yeah. It might be a dude, right? Sexual has been a more or less, you know, I went to whack off last night. I'm like this hand smiling. It was like a 2:00 in the morning. My wife is super pregnant right now and I can't fuck her on her belly. I mean, I do if she asks, but I, I don't, I don't want to impose myself on her.

Speaker 1:          01:32:16       I felt rude. I mean she's all pregnant like she's ready to pop. And um, so anyway, I'm making excuses for why beat off, beat off. But that's the reality of it. I really do feel bad anyway. I go online to go, whoa, look at some porn and everything on one of my favorite sites is all fucking spitting in the mouth and gagging and girls getting their faces fucked with it, like halfway throw it up and ate that. Tears are coming out of their eyes and the guy smack it on the face with his dick and he said, you look like.

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       And he's like, fucking like spit and slobber she's coughing and spits, coming out. And I'm like, okay, I don't like this, this is not fun. And then in the same, uh, the same series, like there was another girl or the same girl rather than have like a bunch of videos by this girl named sasha gray, who was the girl, another one. These guys are just violently fucking her ass. And then shoving it in her mouth and finally fucking around and I'm looking at this and I'm like, what is going on? Like, who is liking all this? Like mad dog porn? It's like you've got a mad dog bitches in porn now. Nobody just fucks anymore. It used to be, you know, a guy who orders a pizza and the chick shows up delivering the pizza. She needs to get changed. Hate that. She drops a dollar and she picks it up and the guy says nice and the girl says, you think so?

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       We see the whole thing and then she pulls her pants down. Next thing you know their bone and that's the good old days. That's fun. That's good times. What does this mouth fucking tears rolling down people's face? Spitting in people's mouths to dixon assholes. Like what's hilarious is that I've never seen a porn website where it's just like it's people making love, just being patched in it and stuff like that. Yeah, there's no. There's no teasing. Just fuck my ass. One girl guys fucking her asshole. One guy was on top. He was squatting on top and the other guy was laying on his back and his dick was in and the other guy was in and it's like that joke that I say about like, you're not even having sex with a woman at that point, you're just using her vagina as a container so that you could rub dicks. That is really what they were doing. They were like, they're two dicks to her. Her butthole was a holder for dick's. Dick's while the plowing this girl's asshole. I mean, think about to dick's, even like two average sized dicks that's stretching your butthole out till like that big. That's ridiculous. Who wants to see them once and then the other guy spit in her mouth and they're fucking her mouth. I'm like, jesus, sasha. Greg, get smacked in the face a lot too, just

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       because I'm done with all that kind of thing. I just like. I like homemade stuff. I think we've talked about this. You liked thinking that that's really you and this girl is really blowing real. Like I want to see people having real sexy, really attracted to it. They're having real orgasms. They're, you know, there's really moaning because they're moaning, not definitely something to that man. It's painful

Speaker 1:          01:35:16       or you know, paint like, and you know, apparently the porn business is rough now because of the fact that all this shit's online. It's very difficult to, to like get money for porn. So these girls get tricked. It's just like, you know, how you hear about the, uh, the workers in dubai where they entice them to come to dubai by saying you're going to get all this money, you know, they take them from India and third world countries and they basically say you are going to make x amount of dollars per month, you'll be able to send money back home to your family. Everybody's going to be happy. We just, uh, you know, just get, come out here and you go get a passport and pay for this and pay for that. So they do all this. They get out there and then once they get out there, they take their passport and they give them a fraction of the money these girls do is they recruit.

Speaker 1:          01:35:56       These girls will say, listen, it's just gonna be you. And the guy, you'll get to pick the guy, it'll be so hot, no big deal, no one's going to see it pay you 1500 bucks. And for a chick who's fucking broken, desperate and probably, you know, not the best thinker in the world anyway, I'm not making the best decisions with their life, you know. And some guy offers are 1500 bucks to fuck some cute guy. She's like, whatever. All right, I'll do it. Fuck it. Who cares? Who's going to know? Who's going to know she figures. I'm just going to go there. I'm going to take care of to keep them from repossessed my car. I'm going to, you know, pay my rent off, you know, and I'll have a couple hundred bucks left over. Alright, let's do it. So she gets there and there was a whole series about this on television that they made her do double anal. Once she got there, they said, no, we don't want regular sex like this is. This is what happens to guys who have to fuck your ass hole and we'll give you 1500 bucks. Otherwise we don't have work for you. No condom, you know, so she was getting hiv

Speaker 5:          01:36:48       I. Yeah. So she does one

Speaker 1:          01:36:51       film. She comes from like Nebraska. She does one film. They make her do double anal fucking pigs nut inside her asshole who probably fucked 100 chicks that day, you know? Yeah. And they give her hiv. They're probably shooting heroin up in the bathroom together. So I'll get each other's cocks to get them hard and they stuffed it in her asshole.

Speaker 5:          01:37:08       By the way, I wanted to mention something you talked about last week in your secret podcast that I wanted to tell you that no, brokeback mountain was a huge success.

Speaker 1:          01:37:18       Yeah. Yeah. I think as a comedy, right? No, no. I mean moneywise. Yeah, but as a comedy. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'd say. I know people enjoyed it now. There was a lot of people. It was sad. I'll be honest. At the end of brokeback mountain, when the guy found out the other guy was beaten to death, it was sad. I never saw it. I will never watch that. You want them while it's just watch it and video put like little kittens over there

Speaker 5:          01:37:41       faces when they're kissing, just like you always do. There's some shit that I won't watch, but I won't watch anymore. Beheadings there's a new line. Have you seen the new one? I watched it for a second and they started cutting the dude's head off. I said, all right. What

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       the fuck am I doing? Why am I watching this? I'm done with that. Yeah. Yeah. There's, there's no need to be watching that shit. I never even watched it. Uh, Iraq shooting thing either. Oh, that's the other thing. I wanted to talk about this fake kung fu. Yeah. You need a rack shooting. Now you need to bring that back. Then I need to write it out with what I need to do. I don't even remember how I did it. I'll just redo it. But uh, the um, uh, the Iraq shooting thing, he didn't want us. The, I don't want to do. We're just talking about collateral murder, which is. We talked about this before. It was a date mistakenly thought that these reporters and civilians in Iraq were insurgents and they killed them and saw gun camera footage and it's very disturbing. It's disturbing how much they were into it. It's disturbing how easy it is to just think that anybody is your enemy when you're over there and the fucking war and the chaos, you know, it's, it's scary shit, man. It's scary shit that were there in the first place, but it's really scary shit to think that people could just be walking with cameras and they mistake those cameras for guns just from the sky with apache helicopters. Just fucking light them up with 50 cannon. I'm done. The caliber gun.

Speaker 3:          01:38:59       I'm done with that shit and anything that's based off three men and a baby, like three guys in a hammer in India. This was based on the baby. Two girls and a cup cup. Yeah, no, you're right man. You know

Speaker 1:          01:39:13       the problem is the internet really can not only desensitize you, but really change your world. There's 300 million fucking people in this country that is an insane amount of people and if you think about like every story that you hear about some priest who's fucking kids or some serial killer who's killing women or they're all horrible and terrible, but the reality is most people are pretty cool. There's $300 million of us. There's so much information that literally you find out every single fucking story anytime that they think goes down. That's never been the case in the 19 fifties. You had to be ed gain. You gotta be, you know, wearing women as fucking dresses. You have to be cutting them up and put in their skin on. They had a fight. You have to make the front fucking page of the New York times, like everyday for a week for everyone to know who you are and everyone would know your story.

Speaker 1:          01:40:04       The ted bundy case, that's another example. The night stalker, when he couldn't catch this guy and they don't know what he's doing, the zodiac killer, they never caught them. Those stories. That's the only way those stories became who they had to be so catastrophic really fucked up, but now we hear about all of them. We hear about every two teachers this week got arrested for fucking kids. Two teachers, two different teachers, both decent looking checks. One of them was fucking a 16 year old. She got arrested for a 16 year old. How the fuck can you arrested? Check for fucking a 16 year old.

Speaker 3:          01:40:33       Did you mention it happened to me though? You know, when I was a kid, a three of our teachers had sex. One was a guy and two were girls.

Speaker 1:          01:40:40       When I was in high school, my spanish teacher fucked one of my friends. Yeah, a female friend of mine.

Speaker 3:          01:40:46       You know what the funniest thing is? I remember my science teacher, sixth grade, I had my book underneath my desk. I was reading the book while she was teaching and she, brian, you have two heads. Only one can read, and I'm like, huh, okay. Well, whatever that means, but then now I look back at it. I'm like, oh my god. She's talking about my head like I'm in sixth grade. What the fuck is that? Crazy. Ms dot singleton, columbus, Ohio. Fucking what are, what are you were 12. How old were you then? Twelfth grade 12, right? Miss singleton and then mr philips, you were my gym teacher. You fucked half my friends. Really? Yeah. And he got a resident gym teacher fucked half your friends are girls mostly boys. And then, and then moving, moving closer. And then what was weird about it? Wait, I'm going to tell the whole goddamn story from springer in elementary.

Speaker 3:          01:41:36       Mr philips and he's in jail. Uh, no, no, check this out. He was. Everyone was always talking about it in elementary school. Like, oh don't let Mr. Phillips, you know, get near you. He fucked so and so. He fucked so and so before he even got caught this before. And there was times where like, he would come up behind you next spanking on the button like, oh, you just touched on. So he was fucking a bunch of kids before he ever got me all knew about it and he never got caught. And then one day he got caught and then we and then there was this one kid that we thought it was like the one at squealed or something like that, and then he was just gone. He was gone and it was so weird. It's like a, I don't know, like five years later I was working at toys r us and he came in with like a whole family and you're just wanting to say, hey, you fucked my friends.

Speaker 3:          01:42:19       What's up Mr. Phillips. He came into toys r us with his family, with his family, kids and family. And I just wanted it to be like, hey, you know your husband. How did he not go to jail? I don't know what ever happened. Like I barely remember seeing it in the papers and stuff like that. Gotta even if you went to jail, he got out. Yeah. Yeah. And he. So he fucked. How many kids do you think? I would say there was three that I thought for sure. Three that you thought for sure. I don't want to stay there. And everybody talks about it. Oh yeah. All of us knew about it. It was like a joke growing up. Even we would like other teachers knew like the word that we call him mr. Film, fill me up. Phillips know side, brookside, elementary school. Elementary school I remember was like fifth grade, maybe sixth grade, 11, 10.

Speaker 3:          01:43:02       So that your teacher was fucking 10 boys in the app and then we had a study hall. My god, we had a study hall monitor named Mrs. Hughes that used to just fuck everybody too. But she was hot. She was and I was like, oh, I was mad because I wouldn't fuck. How old was the middle school was like eighth grade. Seventh grade. She was fucking eighth grade. Yeah. Yeah. And I remember I was pissed because I was jealous of the other guys who I fucked her and I'm like, I want to fuck that girl saving up my lunch money and stuff. It's really funny how that works, isn't it? You know, like, like before the internet man, shit like that would happen and nobody would hear about it. You know? It had to be like they could, they could fire the person and stopped the scandal before it ever hit the school and no big deal. Nowadays, people just throw it up in their face face. Fuck you. I got fucked in the ass. But I, Mr. Phillips, he's a photo and video. Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43:55       Video and photo. While it's happening. If someone's crazy enough to let you know for a teacher who's crazy enough to fuck you, she's crazy enough to film it while she's fucking crazy. I'm 35 person asking, oh yeah, that's a, that's a crazy goddamn story. I didn't. Um, I never got molested by kid, but I came close twice on two separate occasions. I almost got molested one when I was eight years old. I was at the library and I used to like a monster books. I used to like reading like dracula and frankenstein shit. And so I'm in this library section and I'm reading all these books. I'm looking, looking for these books and this guy says, do you like books on monsters? And I said, yeah, that's my favorite. I'm like, you're fucking eight years old, right? I don't know that there's bad people yet.

Speaker 1:          01:44:36       I haven't really figured that out. And the guy says, I've got a bunch of monster books out in my car. Oh no. And I said, wow, really? He goes, yeah, come on with me. I'll show you some monster books. I go, oh, okay. That's why he had monsters. I started leaving. Still love monster movies, man. I start leaving and as I'm walking out the door with this guy, the fucking librarians starts screaming. She goes, joseph, joseph, you get older because she knew me because I'd go to the library all the time. She's like, joseph, get over here. Get over here. That man just got out of jail, and so the guy who runs the guy who wants to go, she goes, I'm going to call the police, and so I run over to the library and I'm fucking crying and freaking out. The crazy thing is my mom doesn't even remember this.

Speaker 1:          01:45:18       Yeah. My mom is kind of a knucklehead and when it comes to that, like my childhood, like I can't believe she doesn't remember this. Remember that. Not remember the most horrific moment of my childhood. Well, I feel like if that light. Brian wasn't there at that moment, if I didn't have a relationship with her where I talked to her every time I was there and she looked after me because she was a nice lady. If that didn't happen, if there was, she was some absent minded person or just wasn't looking or didn't know, didn't know who I was with. That guy was. I woulda got fucked in the ass for sure. I have got killed. He got killed because if this guy just got out of jail, he's probably tired of tattle tale on kids and their bullshit, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:45:57       it probably would have fucked me. Kill me. You know that company that has that thing that you like. Old people were like help. I've fallen and I can't get up. They should make that for kids like help. I'm getting fucked and I can't draw. They should. But kids are fucking liars, man. Be attached like boy scouts or something like, boy scouts will come rescue you instead. Police. There's those council. Fuck you quicker than anybody. Nobody was, you fucking knew like this because you lied about it. Yeah. You let dictionary rant. Come on. Yeah, maybe there will be like a little camera and microphones so that be like, oh, you aren't getting fucked. We'll send somebody right now. I think

Speaker 1:          01:46:36       gps tracking is a good idea. Yeah. You know, I mean that's like the slippery slope. The problem is you put a chip in your kids so you could find out where they are, where they already called them with phones, you know those. Yeah. They have those. Yeah. But phones is big. Devastating. And a chip in your skin mean like a dog, like a dog has a chip, you know, so I can if the, if he gets going, I think it's only if he goes to the vet, if they pick them up at the pound, the pound could scan them and the ship has like a number to call. But you know, there's people that want to put like gps chips in their kids so they could follow their kids. That's retarded. It don't matter if your kid's not retarded, but the slippery slope is who else has fallen you, the executive government.

Speaker 1:          01:47:15       Anybody else? Black helicopters you always hear about, um, a dudes who like attached gps to their chicks car because they're stocking them and they follow them. They follow them around. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's a slippery slope because the, the conductivity is unavoidable. It's unavoidable that eventually there will be no secrets. I really believe that we've talked about this before. I think that eventually we're going to be able to read each other's minds. We're going to be able to access all the information in the whole world, not just on your phone, not just a computer interface, but you're going to be able to normally access all this shit and that includes as other people's thoughts. You're going to have to share your thoughts into the wave. It sounds completely ridiculous. Just sounds like total stoner talk, but I don't think it sounds nearly as ridiculous as the things we already have, like the large hadron collider or cell phones or the ability to talk to somebody on the other side of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:48:08       That's just as ridiculous to me. I mean it's all ridiculous. Sending pictures to the air high speed video you can download. You know what I mean? I got wifi. I sit on my laptop. I can download like the ipad. You download a movie and a couple of minutes you could stream it. Stream a movie alive. What the fuck? You can just go to netflix, pick a movie and high definition loaded up. It plays. There it is. There's the movie. You're getting it from the ether. You're getting a fucking full movie. You put your headphones on, it's in stereo and you're getting it from the sky. That's insanity and that is just the beginning. It's gonna happen. It's gonna. The only. If you look at the trend, the number one trend is conductivity and the instant access to information or the more quicker access to information or more access to information.

Speaker 1:          01:48:56       That's the trend. It's like, you know, used to be libraries and then you know, then then it was the internet and now it's the internet on your phone and then what else is next? What's gonna come next? It's going to be quicker, easier, faster, more information like that, that search engine where you can just ask it questions and it comes up with the answer. What does that search engine called being? No, there's a new one that they're working on. I'll find it on here. I got it. I saved it on evernote, but they called it the google killer. Now know what's going to be the best we already talking about.

Speaker 3:          01:49:27       But the visual search. This I think what's going to be big visual search where you just take a picture of something and it will google search what it is. Everything about it, you know. So like if you see like a, I don't know if you see like a tennis shoe on the ground, you can take a picture of it and we'll tell you what model of tennis shoe that is, you know, where it's sold, how much it is, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:49:45       Yeah, this is. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:49:47       no, I think you're right. Yeah. That, that, that wolfram alpha is the new thing. W o l f r a m alpha and what it is, is this thing that these guys have been putting together for a while. It's not totally done yet, but the idea is that this is going to be able to answer any question you have and that you know, I mean that really is the future that they'll take the data, the entire database of science, the entire database of archeology, history, everything else. Mathematics and literally put it into some sort of a search engine where you'll be able to ask the question. You know, what year was the first car invented? What year was the first combustion engine created? You know, when did they figure out that you could turn the oil from the ground and the gasoline? How did they do it? Who was the guy that shits gonna happen? Man, you're gonna. You're gonna. Be able to get any, any answer to any question. You literally never have to go to school again.

Speaker 4:          01:50:43       I can't wait to the part where I can go through my old photos from when I was like five years old. Hold it up to my webcam. They go, here's their facebook. They now do this. They look at this because there's so many people that have lost touch with and I don't know their name. Babies. What if it's a baby? You can totally do it. You're going to totally be able to do that to the 100 percent. How the baby grows up hundred percent. Ten years or less. One hundred percent.

Speaker 2:          01:51:06       Yeah. I think you're probably right.

Speaker 1:          01:51:08       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:51:09       What's your fucking question? Who this guy named carlos when see it as a homo and needs to send his fans to space with the other monkeys.

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       All right buddy. Settle the fuck down. Settle down. You freak.

Speaker 2:          01:51:23       What is this guy saying? You hate men. Sia for stealing jokes, but you still don't. T rex joke. Hypocrite. I didn't sell steel shit. See rex job. Someone said that there was another guy who was a joke about trx not being able to jerk off this.

Speaker 4:          01:51:36       Wow. How obvious is this that he can check off?

Speaker 2:          01:51:39       Not the greatest connection in the world, but when you have small arms and you can't grab your own dick, I know anybody can come up with that conclusion, but what I had it in is a whole series of things about masturbation. Now masturbation is evolutionary and my joke was that's why the t rex didn't evolve because couldn't jerk off 100 percent my own. Okay. And there's a thing called parallel thinking. The difference between me and a guy like me or most comics I've got ligaments. Ia is most comics like dave attell is famous for. He comes up with a joke, he'll call like a bunch of people and say, hey, if you ever heard this before, you've heard this before, because sometimes guys come up with jokes and even though you came up with it on your own, you don't know whether or not anybody else has come up with it before.

Speaker 2:          01:52:23       It's very possible. It's called parallel thinking, but the difference between that and a guy like matt cea or robin williams or any of these other guys that have been accused of doing it over and over again is there so many fucking pieces of evidence. So many times people have said it. So many people know bits that they've ripped off and like with a guy like robin williams, they used to have it set up where there was special. When he would come to the room, people would flash lights to make sure that the comics onstage knew that he was in the room. When I was in boston, I'm at catch a rising star and cambridge robin williams came and I remember this because I was really raw. I was like an open mic or I'd only been doing comedy like not even a year. You got to piss and robin williams came into the club and there was all these comics that were like a big name.

Speaker 2:          01:53:07       Boston comics. I think one of them was, um, you know what? I don't want to say names because I'm just, I'm just guessing. But there was a bunch of a boston headliners in the room and none of them would go on stage. They wouldn't go on stage because they knew that he was in there and that if they did a good bit on that stage and they were local guys, there were local headliners, but they were just local guys. And this was before the internet. This is before anything. He would just go on the tonight show, the next night, do their bit. And that bit was dead. They could never do it again. So it was a totally different era back then. But there's parallel thinking. There's things that, uh, I've thought of before. There's things that other people have thought of before that I've already done.

Speaker 2:          01:53:42       Like I've had friends, you know, do a bit and uh, you know, there, I know they didn't steal it from me, but I have to tell them like, hey, that's on my first album. Like this. The same exact sort of connection that you just made. Bobby slayton and I who bobby's a buddy of mine, but we both had a joke. I mean, it's the same connection about blow jobs. It was, mine was on my 1999 cd. I don't know when his was, but uh, he said to me like, wow, we have like a similar joke. And the joke was about blowjobs that blow jobs or a job. That's why implies like jerking off. See, my joke was a drifting off. Sounds like it's no big deal. That's like, you just, you know, was just quit at any minute. Like, what are you doing? I was just dripping off like no big deal.

Speaker 2:          01:54:25       You want to eat? I'll just stop. But a blow job sounds like there's much more commitment. Like it's a job, like they're implies a work ethic, but that like jerking off is way more commitment involved the jerking off then blowjobs because chicks will quit blow jobs all the time. Girls will quit, their mouth gets tired. They don't want to do it anymore, but no dude quits while jerking off. And there's like, you know what I mean? It's true. Like just fucking finish that thing. I have had like a half hard dick and be like holding my breath and squeezing. My boss tried to do anything to to figure out a way to just get it over with and then once you calm you just feel so god damn pathetic. But there's a lot of commitment involved in jerking off for whatever reason. Like that's shit wants to get out of your body, but I never for a second thought that bobby stole a bit and he didn't think that I saw the bit. It's like it's kind of obvious blow job, you know? It's not the most clever connection between it being a job. You know what I mean? It's right there. It's in the fucking name.

Speaker 5:          01:55:17       The problem with [inaudible], like when like that t rex thing, that's just something that's a cartoon online that I saw after the fact that the story they haD jokes about, you know that I mean that's just the dumbest. It's just obvious. Troll and I think might know

Speaker 2:          01:55:34       probably just stupid or was just young and he doesn't know. I mean, it's, look, you know, people, people have questions about the way Comedy works and whenever someone is so about plagiarism, like I have been in, you have been with that whole men see a thing, uh, you know, not like we set out to do that. Not like we set out to be the guys that are speaking up against comedy plagiarism. But let me tell you how many fucking comedians were happy that, that happened. I mean, I can't tell. I've just got a text message from christopher titus today. Christopher titus was a friend of mine, just sent me a text today and christopher is a very funny comic. And uh, he sent me a text today saying that, um, he says, hey man, you were on npr today. They played the whole carlos thing and had two lawyers on talking about how convenience protect our material.

Speaker 2:          01:56:21       Great job changing the world, keep the flow. And you get a copy of that. Yeah. This is a comic. So, and it's not just him. I mean louis, c, k, so the same thing, you know, uh, brian posehn came up and hugged me and said, thank god for you joe rogan. I mean I came, todd glass came out to me and said it was the greatest thing you've ever seen in his life. Like I can't tell you how many comics have said this, like we had a real problem for a long time and the real problem is that these networks can make money from god's stealing if guys are good performers and they wound up stealing people's shit. They can make a lot of money. And for comIcs literally it takes a long ass time to create a bit like, a bit like my bit about the tigers killing the kid at the zoo in san francisco.

Speaker 2:          01:57:02       The one that made it onto my last special. THat bit took a long time to get right. There was a lot of shit involved in like it went back and forth. It changed, morphed, it got bigger, it got smaller. It took a long time before I came up with the version that got onto television. It was a lot of work. Somebody could have easily come in, jacked. My idea, jack, my premise jack, the whole way I structured it, set it up and just taking it for their own and literally it's stealing. They put it on television and now I can't do it anymore because now if I do it, you know, like when a minute cstl stuff, he steals it like word for word, you know, oftentimes. So like these poor folks, like there are bits gone. It's like it's got stole, they got stolen, somebody took their shit.

Speaker 2:          01:57:45       That's been a gigantic problem for us. You know, we didn't set out to be the ones to try to put a fork in that and stop it, but something had to happen and it did. And it just so happens that it was us and it's just, just synchronicity. Just the way the world works, you know. But um, I can understand why someone would want to like, scrutinize me extra carefully because of that. I mean, that only makes sense. Put red bands balls to your mouth, please. You know what, that is a fucking rude, rude request.

Speaker 4:          01:58:17       Uh, there's this kind of comic named Brian Jarvis, I don't know if you ever heard him. He has the best joke ever for some reason. Comics all like to show their dicks to each other, but he has this thing where he'll put his dick coming out of the top of his pants like right here. So just its head sticking out. And he'd be like, dude, I fucking slammed my belly button in my door. Look at it and your belly button and you look and you're like, whoa,

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       wait, do all the time. I love that shit. I mean I hate that shit, but I love how everyone's so comics are so committed to showing their dicks. It's hilarious.

Speaker 2:          01:58:55       George lopez deal a bit from our. no, I don't think he did. I think that thing that happened with the George Lopez thing was that it was a pretty obvious bit. The thing with the rap thing about the wall. That's it. That's a Fucking obvious job man. And these dudes who do like mexican material, you know, an illegal alien material like lopez, his actors. It's very funny, but a lot of is latino stuff. And that's thE kind of thing, I mean, he's got to think like that. George has never been accused of being a deep before that. Not that I'm aware of, but

Speaker 5:          01:59:26       he's not an obvIous joke. there was like five comics that dead that joe put them and see a thing meant not only did ari open for him and do that bit and he saw it and commented on how he thought it was funny. But that dumb fuck did the same mannerisms that are like windows. Excuse me. That's how he does it. And he's so dumb. He does it the exact same way in our video. He even said he never opened up for me. And then like three seconds later, he what? oh, he forgot he was. I mean, he just likes to read that whole video. He's got everything. he's still sometimes says he's mexican. Are we talking about ms? See if there's no poor guy. Poor guy. Some people people

Speaker 2:          02:00:04       still get. I still get caught up in it. You know, look, there's, there is, there's always gonna be retards. There's always gonna be dumb fucks. Oh, he's going to be choked faced. There's always goIng to be everything, man. There's, there's always, there's always gonna be people who enjoy stupid shit. There's always going to be people who, uh, think nancy is hilarious and I suck. That's all good, man. It's a fucking big world, you know, like what you like. Who gives a fuck son? Well, you know what, we're at five minutes and 13 seconds, which means we just ate through two hours. So that's more than enough. More than enough. I'll look. There's all this comedy stuff, you know, go, go. Let's you hear. So instead of all this negative stuff, crossman sia rules, that's what he rules your mother. This is, um, this is, uh, what I think there's, there's great comics right now.

Speaker 2:          02:00:52       This is one of the best times ever for standup comedy. There's so many good guys. There's bIll burr who is a hilarious comic. If you never heard his stuff before. I did that. I'm kevin and being april foolishness show with him a couple of weekends ago. Fucking dude is fantastic. He's hilarious. There's patton oswald, who's one of my favorites.
