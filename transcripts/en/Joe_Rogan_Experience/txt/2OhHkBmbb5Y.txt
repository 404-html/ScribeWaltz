Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Should I, should I do headphones? It doesn't matter. Yeah, like headphones. I kind of hate hearing myself that way. Sound good. Why did you hear yourself? Do you try to pull this sucker up like about a fist from your face? Good to see you again, man. It's been a long time. It has been. What? The guy like you. It's always nice to see you're still alive. Do you remember best to get tired of hearing shit like that? Oh, I don't care. I mean, do you get tired of the weirdness of like interviewing with people and they're like, you know, you know you could die. Is this scary? Yeah. Yeah. That's all right though. I mean, the thing. Yeah, it's funny. A tournament, the film we've been doing q and a's every night. You get the same questions from the audience all the time and part of that is tiring, but then part of it like people ask some questions because they're obvious because everybody wants to know the same things and I'm like, I understand that one of the weirdest parts of the film is when they're showing all the guys who have died from free soloing and they're actually.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       They didn't all die free soloing. Oh, that's actually one of the. That's probably the only thing that I take slight issue with a film, slightly hyperbolic [inaudible]. The two of them died base jumping and one of them died rope jumping. They were all were free solos, which is kind of what the film is saying that they're all free solis who have died, but they all died in the mountains doing mountain related extreme activities, you know, that's. That doesn't make the story is good. That's like poetic license. Yeah, he got sneaky. Well, you know, I mean they all were free solace, but yeah, that's not the same though. Yeah, no, exactly. I, I preferred it. The other way to look at it is the no free solis has ever died doing anything. Cutting edge. That's my favorite statistic that I'm like no free solos has ever died doing hard solar.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       Like basically free a few free solos have died falling off at easy turn or just falling off sort of routine or you know, I don't know, just falling off the mountain, but none of them have ever died while doing something, cutting edge. Something that had never been done before. Something that was you hardcore. Do you think that's because when you're doing something that's a little bit easier, you relax. I think that's probably part of it, but also I think part of it is just a numbers thing. You spend so much time doing easy stuff and so little time doing really hard stuff that, you know, it's just statistics. But um, how much, how important is it when, when you were free soloing to have that edge to be like really cognizant about how intense this is? Like if you got to calm to relaxed. No, I think that's.

Speaker 1:          00:02:24       I think that is kind of the concern for sure. And I, I've noticed that in for myself anyway, and I try not to do very much easy soloing anymore because there is a certain complacency that overtime, you know, you just do so much mileage on easy terrain and then you're like, this is so easy, this is so easy. And then you slip and you die. Well, you know, you know, fighters look at things that way too. Like they at a certain point in their life, they don't want easy fights because they need to get challenged, otherwise they won't train properly. And then they wind up losing to be. Yeah, you should take it seriously. Yeah. Well the difference between a fighter say

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       when they're not trained in not in camp and just their skill and what their body can do without, without going through a camp is probably only like 70 percent of what they are when they actually go through everything with full intensity, eight weeks, two times a day, you know, physical therapy, massage, visualization, conditioning, all the, all the things that make them who they are the day they step into the cage. Like when you free Solo.

Speaker 3:          00:03:31       It's funny that, so that's, yeah, I mean if you saw the film and that's all a exactly the level of preparation that went into it.

Speaker 2:          00:03:38       Do you take time off before a big free solo? Do you like, you just kind of the opposite. It's the. No, it's the opposite. It's sort of ramping up to it. Right. But do you, is there any concern that maybe you haven't given yourself enough recuperative time like that for the day of.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       No, so for me anyway, it was always sort of the opposite because the real challenge of free soloing is the psychological side of the mental side of it. It's not so much the physical, like I don't necessarily have to physically perform at the absolute limit of what I'm capable of, but I have to mentally perform at that level. And so, and the mental side of it comes so much from confidence and feeling, you know, feeling prepared. And so I don't know. So when I, when I freestyle it all cap, I kind of knew that I wasn't actually, um, like I'd probably already started to decline a little bit physically over the course of the season because the two months in the seventies just kind of grueling on her body, like it all the time I spent going up and down on the wall and preparing.

Speaker 3:          00:04:31       It's very, very tiring. And so I kind of realized that I was starting to get sort of deeply fatigued. I was sort of a week away from having started a slump, a black girl. I'm Kinda pooped. But the thing is I knew that that because of all that preparation, you know, psychologically I was as, as good as I was ever going to be. So even if I was physically starting to be a little bit tired, it's like time to, you know, it's kind of the different curves. You have to hit it right at the right moment.

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       No. Is your psychological preparation just you getting your mind into it or do you have like specific techniques you use or a form of meditation or anything that you specifically concentrate on? When you're visualizing success or

Speaker 3:          00:05:08       no, when it's not even necessarily visualizing success or it's visualizing, for me it's visualizing the experience, like sort of imagining what everything will feel like imagining what it would like to place my foot on a hold or what, you know, grabbing like the sensations of it and the exposure of it. Um, you know, thinking through what it'll feel like with so much air around me and no rope. Just that basically to make sure that nothing is surprising when I get there

Speaker 2:          00:05:31       to my hands are sweating. Just talking to you. I'm not kidding. Feel that, feel that. That's fucking gross. Right? As a clam. I realized it like when I'm talking to you, I'm thinking about you doing this and my hands started sweating. You start thinking about thousands of a or in your life. Start thinking about chalk and powder and that shit like that. God Damn Dude. Have you ever gone to like a sports psychologist

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       or have you ever actively tried to coordinate a program for mental training or anything like that? No, not really. I mean, so with, with reselling ocap I found that I needed to create enough space for, it's not so much mental training but um, but create enough empty time so that I had a so that I was able to sort of process so, um, I don't know, so I like stopped shooting an email. I raised my social media, like sort of freedom my life and then actually my girlfriend left for the sort of the week ahead of time, so that was just totally by myself and my van with nothing going on, like no distractions. And so that's not exactly, you know, mental training, but it was giving myself the free time that I could just sit around and think about things, you know, I can process it in my own terms in my own time.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       When was the last time we talked? How many years ago? It was so long. I feel like it was at least for right? Oh No, it was like six or seven. It wasn't I think so. I think it was like 2012 or something. During that time. How much has changed in your life in terms of the way people perceive what you do and the amount of attention that you get? I would imagine that having that alone time now you as much harder. Yeah. Yeah. No, totally. It's, it's funny. I mean I've tried to not let my life get busy over time, but it just sort of naturally happens. I mean, what would success? Yeah, exactly. Just some one more times. I'll be. When I was reached out to you, I reached out to you a couple of times, but I was like, this guy is probably getting fucked with all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       Like someone's probably always poking at you and you're just trying to get a foothold. Like literally just trying to hold on. No, I mean, no, I mean I, I appreciate all the opportunities that have now and you know, I mean I'm, I'm very happy with the way my life has changed over time, but certainly when I look back at 10 or 12 years ago when I was just a single 20 year old man living in a car, like I had nothing going on. You know, if, uh, if I had like one interview in a month, I'd be like, well, it's a big month for media, you know, and then now on the film tour, it's like completely outrageous. It's totally the other end of the spectrum. Now when you do in this film to uh, when, when does the film actually come out? Films like out.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       It's in theaters. So I couldn't go see right now. But you can't get it on itunes yet. Is that what it is? So yeah. So, so it did a month of festival circuit in, you know, earlier in the end of the summer and then it came out in theaters at the end of September. So right now I think this weekend is its widest release. It's like 400 theaters all over the country are now. Wow. But, and then in theory, um, it's through national geographic, so I think it'll be on television, on the channel at some point and then eventually it'll stream somewhere. I Dunno. Is it strange all this attention? Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know. It's in some ways it's a natural extension of all the stuff I've had over the years, you know, like having a 60 minutes piece and many years ago was a bit of a, it was a flurry of attention and so they're kind of sort of prepared me in some ways, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:08:49       But yeah, I mean, and well, you've dealt with this your whole life. I mean it's. Yeah, but I'm asking like an interesting. Yeah. But I feel like it comes with what I do. I'm in show business. That's, you know what I mean? That's fair. You're, you're a climber. Yeah. And the most radical kind of climber free solo you think when I think of what you do, I think of quiet tension. Yeah. That's, that's kind of fair. Yeah. Because it should be, it should be sort of meditative and relaxing and quiet, but then obviously you're also sometimes straining your entire body, you know, like trying very hard physically and. Yeah. Well I remember one of the things you said to me the last time we talked was that it's, it's very mellow because if it ever gets intense, something's gone wrong. Yeah, no, I still feel exactly the same way.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       I mean that's, yeah, that's always the challenge is to keep it, keep it relaxed, but for a guy like you, my perception of a guy like you, who's that? That person who's doing that activity than to sort of juxtapose that with this media tour type environment and dealing with all these people that, that, that seems to me like it would be really annoying. I mean, yeah, it's very different than my normal normal lifestyle I guess. But the thing is, you know, it's sort of an adventure and it's an experience in its own way. I've been, I've been kind of calling it a expedition film tour because a, I've done a lot of expeditions in my life. Like last winter I went to Antarctica for a month and, and it's not exactly the type of climate that normally do and I don't really like being cold, but you sort of like, oh it a once in a lifetime opportunity to go somewhere, you know, it was like going to Mars or something.

Speaker 1:          00:10:28       It was this totally outrageous experience. We're climbing big rock walls and in an article you're just living on the glacier and it's totally different. Totally crazy. He camped out on a glacier. Yeah. Yeah. We're just in a tent on a glacier for a month. When you do that, how thick a pad do you use? A really thick and a very, very thick sleeping bag. Do you ever get warm? Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. In Your Sleep Med. It's a negative 40 degree sleeping bag. I mean, it's pretty good job but. But anyway, I mean, so that kind of experience, you know, in some ways it's very comparable to a film to where I'm like, this is going to be a once in a lifetime thing. You just embrace it. You go with it, you know, it's different than the way you normally choose to live your life, but that kind of makes it understanding, you know, it's something new.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       Well, I can imagine it would be very interesting. The Antarctica thing sounds like a trip. Yeah. Like were you traveling on uh, uh, established corridor? It was. No, no. It's what. So some people had climbed in the region before, but um, but we actually did tons of first ascents like roots and summits that had never been climbed. Wow. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Now when you do something like that, do you map it out in advance? Like, I mean, well, not really because I mean they're photos of, of the formations and people, like I said, it climbed some of them. Um, some Norwegians had sort of pioneered the area and written a book about it, but um, but then it's not until you get there that you can really decide what you're going to climb and how it looks. I mean ultimately you have to look at the rock and see if it's climate bowling, so you basically just have to ski up and then touch it and see what you can do and then try to climate you ski up where you are because you're living on a glacier.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       I mean you have to ski everyone. Wow. It was cool. I did a, I did a month wearing only ski boots or climate shoes. Wow. Or, or my bedroom slippers are on camp. What'd you feet feel like? Oh No, we're in a really thick socks and then keeping everything as warm as possible, but, but yeah, I mean we're in climate. Jews in Antarctica goes pretty chilly. Yeah. Actually there's a film about that coming out in a couple of weeks I think as part of the real rocky or it's like a big climbing film festival thing or film tour that sort of shows around the world. But. So it's like a 40 minute short. They're 30 minutes short. I'm actually, I haven't seen it yet, but those shoes that you wear on a normal climb are very flexible with those last sportiva yeah, that's what I said.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       Our, yeah, they're very, they almost look like a sock with a rubber bottom to it where you could really kind of grip. It depends. So some are super soft like that. Um, it depends on what you're trying to climb that summer. Really rigid so that you can step on a really small holes and it supports your foot. So like what I was wearing, free soloing El cap is quite rigid actually. It's like a board, like a platform. So that you can put just the tip of your toe on something really small and you're focused to stay, stay flat, welcome mountaineering type of. Yeah, kind of, but still also very precise because mountaineering boot, you think clunky and big climbing shoes, like a ballet slipper, like precise and tight. But then also rigid sometimes. Yeah. And then also, I don't know, you know, when you're climbing cracks, you put your foot into the crack and then torque it sideways to like lock it into place.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       And so the stiffer the shoe is, the more it can, you know, the more that you can lock the shoe into place, it's pose your foot. You basically have to use fewer muscles. I, when are you starting a trend? Are there other people that are following you footsteps now? Actually, what do you think? I think probably. Yeah. You think, yeah, you honestly think though. Yeah, I think there's probably some people that look at what you're doing and the young kids that think it must be, you know, here's what I think most people look at the path that the average person takes in life, you know? Oh No, sell cars, I'm going to be an insurance guy, and they look, they look at it like it's death for. They look at a kid, a young kid who's like enjoying playing with his friends or doing sports or playing video games or reading comic books and then you look at what could be the average path that the average person takes in life and sitting in an office all day under fluorescent lights and it looks like death.

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       It looks like a slow aching death, but then I look at someone like you. I'm like, wow, this guy is living a special life. This is a special life was so ideally though somebody would look at it and see that this is somebody living a very intentional life or having chosen a certain path, not necessarily free selling. I mean I would love to inspire people to live an intentional life that they care about. I don't necessarily feel like people need to go free solar. Right. Well I think that's. That's a very good way of describing it. Very good way of putting. Because I think you most

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       certainly have influenced people in that regard, but I think also people must be influenced in the sense that they see where you're doing is man, there's moments that you must experience while you are climbing these incredible faces that are kind of magical. When you're up there, you're a thousand feet up there. The view is fucking spectacular and you're doing it and you get to the top of these things though the rush and the feeling of accomplishment and the euphoria and just the glory of nature

Speaker 3:          00:15:27       from the perspective yet, or like, look at this. You could fucking wash your clothes on the sweat. That's in my hands right now,

Speaker 2:          00:15:36       man. That's a stat. Fucking pictures insane. We're looking at, what is the name of this photo, Jamie?

Speaker 3:          00:15:44       It's a endura corner from cap. That's actually, that's a movie poster. Do Fuck. That man

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       is so, so that, that that is not sitting in a cubicle. That is

Speaker 3:          00:15:57       not fluorescent light. That is the end of a very long path that you have to choose and really cultivate. You know what I mean? That's, that's for me, 23 years of sort of going into or 22 years or something of going down a very specific path. Very specific, you know. And you're still. Do you have a different van? Are you still in the same van? I'm in a better man. The last time I was here. Moving on. Yeah, moved up. It was pretty exciting. And to have a house now that's actually a real person. I live in La. I live in Las Vegas now. Do you realize? Yeah. Yeah. Why Las Vegas? Uh, do the best, best four season climate in the country. We Love Las Vegas. Yeah, there's climbing everywhere and it's super accessible and it's easy and it's cheap. Cost of living easy. You no traffic like everything is easy, but I love Vegas.

Speaker 3:          00:16:42       That's cool. Yeah. Um, whenever I go to Vegas I was looking at the mountains outside of it and they're right there and nobody even looks at them from my driveway. You can see 2000 foot walls. I mean you, you can be climbing on a 2000 foot long, 25 minute drive, 20 minute drive. That's interesting. Yeah. A lot of people like to run those mountains to run those hills. There's a lot of trail runners that live in that area as well. Yeah, totally. Yeah. The west side of town and you're like in the mountains. I mean, I can go mountain biking. I can go hiking, I can go climbing on 20 minutes. You Vegas is kind of a misunderstood place really is. Everyone just thinks the strip, but it's like it's not really the strip. It's like the mountains all around it, but biggest is like in a bowl of mountains.

Speaker 3:          00:17:18       I mean all sides of it are surrounded by mountains. Will Nevada in general kind of gets weird because. Yeah, I know people think of the desert in Nevada, but really it's mountains. I mean it's like series of mountain ranges all the way across the state. Yeah, it really is. I have a buddy who lives in Reno. He lives outside of Reno and if you went near where he lives, he'd be like, where are we? Call Rato. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. No, I'm in Tahoe, like talk was right there and yeah, in truckee donner, I mean there's a bunch of commentary is right there. They're great and freaking skiing all winter. It's pretty cool. How old, you know, I'm a 33. Do you feel

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       any difference in the way your body responds to doing this on a regular basis now? Maybe a little bit. Um, I'm, I hate to say I'm getting old and everything but uh, but I think especially right now with the film to her, the amount of travel, I'm like, I'm more intentional about my diet and stuff now and trying to get enough sleep and things like that. So in the, you know, 10 years ago I could just eat a whole tray oreos and be like, all right, I feel great. Let's go climb in the gym. It'll be fun, you know, now I'm like, Oh man, I want my green smoothie, I want to get my night's sleep. And Yeah, I saw that you're, you're not eating meat anymore. And then you eat a lot of vegetables and do you get your blood work done or do you do work with nutritionists?

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good. Good. Um, yeah, and I mean I don't have cheese and stuff and I mean even meat. So I mean I gave up eating meat for environmental reasons mostly, um, like basically impact on the earth and so I'm not fundamentally pose, you know, like I'll eat meat from time to time certainly for, for cultural norms. Like uh, you know, I was in Japan earlier this year and I'm sorry fish, they're a bit just because I felt like it was part of the sort of Japanese travel experience. Um, if someone hunted it, would you eat it? Yeah, yeah, sometimes. But the thing is I just don't feel like I need to intentionally kill another creature for me to survive. And so if somebody was going to go hunting for me to eat, I'd be like, no, that's fine. We're going to need that. But then I'm like, on an expedition to Antarctica, I ate a bunch of random meat just because it's like, it's already there, you know, the other team members have already brought it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       I'm sort of like, well, I'm hungry or whatever, you know. Um, mollusks are actually a good thing for people to look into that are Vegan or vegetarian and they don't want to eat meat because they're actually more primitive even than vegetables. They're not like, like, um, clams and scallops. They're incredibly primitive. They, they have no feelings. They don't feel anything. They have no that there's an argument that could be made that plants communicate far more than mollusks lobster, oysters rather mussels. Barnacles. Yeah, crunchy. But there's a protein to them that's similar to an animal protein, but incredibly primitive to what I mean, insect protein. I think it's sort of a potential future of humanity today. Um, yeah, I'm not, I'm not fundamentally opposed to eating insects, but it's just, you know, they're rarely served. But I would just imagine that particularly as you get older, like nutrition would be a major factor.

Speaker 1:          00:20:23       Making sure you get the proper amount of essential fatty acids and making sure that because your brain must be like you have to fuel your brain in terms of like giving your brain the building blocks for neurotransmitters and all these different things that you're. You're using when you're. You've got this intense concentration for many, many hours at a time and you're not eating when you're doing these things. Sometimes you do stop and you eat something. I mean you have to. I mean if you're criminal or something like flowers, sometimes little bars or nut butter. Fairmount are. Yeah, those f bombs. Do you ever take those that has that? Oh, they're great. I have a whole box of them will give you some. They them, yeah. It's called a [inaudible]. It's called F bomb, like fat bomb, but it's all like nut butter and oils and it comes in a packet.

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       You just ripped the top of the package off and squeeze it in your mouth. I had three x morning. Oh Wow. That's really good. It's really healthy. If one sitting around, I'm curious. I want to do have them in the back. I finished it. Um, yes. That is it. Tell Jeff there's a box of them in my office over there. You know where the boxes just go. You can go run in and grab them. Go run into that door, run into the office door and like sitting right in the front to the right hand side. There's a box of them. I'll give you that. That's exactly what I'm talking about. The know butterflies. I eat the shit out of those things. I eat like three or four of them in the morning when I'm headed out the door with a cup of coffee. Like a lot of, a lot of that though.

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       It was just a lot of calories at there. I'm doing this sober October fitness challenge with my friends. I've been working out. I'm not now no bullshit as much as five hours in a day because I'm trying to win this. We have a wwe style championship belts. It says intercontinental champion. So rocktober or intergalactic champions. So the sober part though, does that mean you're not? No Pot, no booze, no nothing. Oh yeah. Here's your just clean living for all of October and training. Fricken brainer. Yeah. Well we were wearing these, uh, these belts that measure your heart rate and they also quantify your performance, like how much calories you've burned. And there it is. He could take that. That's tufts to shit. What flavors? That one, um, academia pecan with Cecil. Fantastic stuff. I liked the chocolate and sea salt one too. I'll look through in a sample of players are good.

Speaker 1:          00:22:49       That's cool. It's a real healthy. It's, you know, just watch it. It's really what you need. You actually list ingredients or. Yeah, yeah. No, it seems awesome. And you just tear, you smush them up and you tear the top and just squirt it in your mouth. Yeah, I do that climbing a lot. I kind of prefer that to, to um, you know, gels or Goo or whatever you want to call it because that's just pure sugar. I kind of prefer to have pure fat. Yeah. Certainly for climbing, um, it's just not like in, it's not like running or cycling or something where your engine is burning nonstop where you kind of need to just like pumps sugar into it. It's kind of a longer slow burn. You can, you can eat fat for sure. Do you ever, um, mess around with nootropics at all? I've never even heard that word. Nootropics are, are the building blocks for human neurotransmitters. It's like they're there. Their supplements that enhanced cognitive function is, some of them are like standard, what you'd get at like Gnc you wouldn't think of as a nootropic, but they're finding out they are

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       like creatine. They're finding out creatine is actually a pretty potent nootropic. It actually enhances cognitive performance. But, um, there's one called Alpha brain that my company has. I'll send a bunch of it to you. There's another company called neuro one that makes a great one. You know, Bill, Roman [inaudible] is a former NFL player who, uh, you know, took a lot of patriots. No, it mostly on the broncos. Yeah. Savage, crazy animals. And during his day, you know, obviously sustained a lot of head injuries and wanted to find some sort of a natural way to replenish his brain function. So He created this company called neuro one and that's. This is how I found out about nootropics is through his, his product. It's fantastic. Great stuff. It's just powder. You put it in water, shake it up. It actually has a protein and a bunch of different neurotransmitters in it, but it's really good for enhancing function.

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       Interesting. I wonder if it actually works. Yeah, it does. Well, Alpha brain, my company, we had two double blind placebo controlled studies with the Boston Center for memory that showed improvements in verbal memory and reaction time in peak alpha flow state. So what is peak out propose to? That's a good question. You have to start to dive into it. Yeah, they're all the. If you go to [inaudible] dot com, all of the tests are available. You can go over what it means, but what, what you find from these. Another one called true brain that. What is that guy's name? That when he was a guest to the podcast, Dr Andrew. No, that's Andy Galpin. There's my point is besides my company does a bunch of companies and make a really good ones and they are fantastic. If you have to give speeches or have you talked to one of the things that I do like

Speaker 3:          00:25:41       commentary, straight cocaine, you, you're all fired up and you just give a great talk or anything. You're like, methamphetamines, you just get all fired up. That's a question I had for you too. Like how many people that are doing what you do are on either adderall or they take things like Beta blockers, that sort of. Honestly I think nobody but I mean a lot of climbers smoke a lot of weed or you know, and nowadays I don't even know what you do with it because you don't even have to smoke. Just you drink it and stuff. I don't know. There's so many like cannabis things now, but um, but no, I don't know. So I, I've never really done drugs. I don't, I'm not totally interested center, they know anything about it. But um, I don't know. It's interesting because it's not like anyone's drug testing climbers and unless they're competing in the world cup level or it's actually gonna be in the Olympics in 2020, but yeah, climbing goes, it's like a demonstration.

Speaker 2:          00:26:30       So did they have um, an event like in terms of like a pathway that you have to go through?

Speaker 3:          00:26:35       So it's um, what's a world cup climbing breaks into three disciplines like lead climbing, which is like a same as the indoor wall and then bouldering, which is without a rope, you know, you just climbed 12 feet or whatever. And then speed climbing where it's like a preset course. Everyone does the exact same course where you just go as fast as you can and just against the time. And so normally those are three disciplines for the World Cup, but the Olympic format combines all three into one competition because they're limited by how many metals and whatever, because it's like a demonstration sport. They're just sort of, you know, it's smaller scale than, than some of the other sports in the Olympics. But. So, um, yeah, so basically common competitors just have to do all three disciplines. And See who wins. I was watching something on youtube where they had this climbing competition more.

Speaker 3:          00:27:17       They like ready, set, go. And then they like shot up. That's the speed coming. And this lady who's wearing a burka, she, she like famous or something. No, I don't know. But um, but there are a bunch of really strong Iranian speed climbers and so I wouldn't be surprised if, if, uh, it's part of that, ah, she ran up at like a spider was crazy to watch yet for whatever reason, speak something is really big in eastern Europe. And then there are a couple of really good Iranian speed commerce and um, yeah, they're just, it's like it's sort of, it's own little niche sport coming out of certain parts of the world that is. Well there's some strong genes over there and around like a lot of great wrestlers because, I dunno, I dunno if the woman you're talking about is from there. I'm thinking of one specific dude who's so much his portrait in speed, Iranian Foreign Nas.

Speaker 3:          00:28:05       Spell that as my. Is I there? I think you've pretty much got that. Yeah. What I want to see the video that I want to see you find the video of her because she's a fucking spider man. Runs up the side of that hill. He's going to browse the Internet. Yes. He could find her anyway. But so with the, uh, with the new Olympic style climate, I mean, obviously there'll be drug tested with world cup is drug testing, but it's funny with the. But nobody really uses performance enhancing drugs. I don't think they have legs one. Fear enough. I'm good. Thank you. One a one world cup climber had a metal taken away for having used a recreational cocaine. And he was like, Oh, I'm really sorry. Uh, you know, I'm sorry I did coke. But he was like, it was more for the partying and the performance, you know, she is.

Speaker 3:          00:28:52       Look at her place. I mean, for a guy like you, is that impressive? Like what? See that play that from the beginning, does it? That's, that's pretty fast. That's not as fast. I mean, if you watch some of the more lead times, it's, it's faster for sure. Um, women or men? Both, I think. I don't think that's true in that. I think so. I don't know. Wow. I don't know man. Well, you're, you're the guy who would know to me. That's damn impressive. Just look up a world record. I mean, I think the male record is like five point seven seconds, six seconds. It's like something really, really fast. Now. Do they know this path in advance? Yeah. So that's exactly the same route for everybody. Always same distance, same holds. Um, and so you basically memorize the sequence and then you just perform it as fast as you can. So here we go. Here's the world record as this.

Speaker 3:          00:29:45       So you stand on that thing and the timer starts when your one foot comes off the timer on the ground and then it ends. When you slap the thing on the top. Oh my God. Yeah. Look at that five point. Whatever seconds. Oh my God. That doesn't look real. It doesn't look like he's just running on the sidewalk. Just tilted the camera and they're, they're faking it. Yeah. For the camera. Yeah. No, it's totally. Now, do these guys free solo or they, they specifically concentrate on. Imagine if you were free, so like, like this, you would die for sure. Know that Beta blockers would be something that someone who free Solos would want to look into. I don't even know yet. I don't know that it was Beta blockers or something that blocks your, your brain's production of adrenaline. Oh, but I mean, I don't know if you'd want that though, because the thing is if you have an adrenaline spike it's because something weird went on and you probably want to.

Speaker 3:          00:30:38       Like I've had A. I've had a couple times where I broke a hold off or something. Like all of a sudden your whole drips off and then you have that like superhuman surgery and you grabbed back on. Yeah. You don't want to be mellow at that time. Yeah, exactly. You don't want to be like, I'm so relaxed as I fall all the way to the valley floor. You know? It's like you want to fricking hold on. One of the things in the film was one of the guys who fell and I guess eventually died. He was doing it. He fell and base jumped. Yeah. With a parachute. He called it freebasing. He sort of pioneered the sport as a word, but they're usually a good thing to have on your back. Well, not really. So yeah, I mean the idea makes sense that if you're going to fall off a cliff, have a parachute.

Speaker 3:          00:31:17       The thing is that you need to be on a very specific kind of cliff, like what he was on, where it was overhanging so that when he fell he cleared the wall and he floated out into space. But the thing is when you send money, all the walls are slightly less than vertical in general. And so it means that you just tumbled down the wall, you know? And the other thing is that even if you have a parachute, parachutes function as a. When you have a direction to them, like Eric comes into them and you fly in a direction which means that you have to be facing away from the wall. When you opened your parachute or else you just fly right into the wall and crash. Yeah. So it basically means that if you fall off unexpectedly, you then have to track away from the wall.

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       Write yourself in mid air, you know, correct for everything and then make sure you're facing the right way. And he was like, basically there's a lot of things that have to go right for the parachute to help you. But no, that's not good. Yeah, I mean it's one of, a lot of people ask that. They're like, oh, why don't you wear a parachute? And you're like, well it's basically this 10 pound training weight that doesn't really help you much with that guy. Just jumped on purpose. Yeah, this is. Oh, well, yeah. So it's good. So this is on the Uyghur though, it looks like, I think. Um, and you can. Yeah. So he's like jumping away. He's getting a nice controlled opening. He's like flying away from the cliff. It's like everything is going right for them. But imagine if one of his foot holes just broke and he started pinwheel and down the wall it's like you'd never get the separation from the wall.

Speaker 3:          00:32:32       Disaster like was just watch extreme sports videos and I'll just commentate on them because were like all, well this guy is surely going to have a disaster. Well, one of the things from the video when they were talking about all the people that have died, that every, essentially everyone from the past that was a free solar is dead and you're saying there's other things that they were doing, like base jumping, like base jumping and, and, and even, there are a couple of older soloists, I mean in the film, uh, Peter Croft, who's like a legendary soloist and he was a childhood hero of mine and he's, you know, I don't want to say pushing 66. I'm not sure how old Peter is, but he's, you know, he's an older, he's a distinguished gentleman and he's uh, he's living in the eastern Sierra. He's climbing all the time.

Speaker 3:          00:33:14       He's like loving life with his wife and actually he's in Greece on a sport climbing vacation right now. I'm just climbing for two months, just fun climbing with a rope, having a great time. And so, you know, I look at somebody like Peter and he, he was free soloing at, at the very cutting edge for 20 years basically. And it's still just a happy climate now, but does he free solo anymore? It just climbs well. So it's funny. I had dinner with him a couple of years ago and I was like, oh Peter, at what point did you quit soloing at sort of an elite level, you know, like when did you sort of back off the grids? And he was like, well actually I did want to technically by the numbers I did one of my hardest free solos couple of years ago. Um, but it was like a sport route at his local Craig.

Speaker 3:          00:33:49       So like a route that he routinely climb for fitness. They just happened to be a pretty hard number, you know, like climate grades are all sorted, categorized. And so you use like. Yeah, technically one of my hardest solos. It was just recently, but it's like a hard number but not nearly as much of an undertaking as some of the big solos that he'd done in the past. Like some of the walls that he had at any 70 back in the day, you know. And so he was like, oh, it's all just kind of how you define difficulty, you know. Now when, when you say that there's a number system that sort of rates what, like how difficult a free Solo Path is? Well, no, the rates climbing in general with a rope or without a rope is just, it just rates how hard our climate is.

Speaker 3:          00:34:26       What is El Cap was? So the route that I climbed is 5:12 d for whatever that means, or maybe it's 13, eight depending on how you, depending on what you want to call it. But um, what does that mean? Yeah, exactly. So the climbing, climbing grades are defined, I don't know. So in America it's by the, you many decimal system and it's a classification of terrain from one to one to six decibels decimal decimal system, you know? Yes. But it's, it's other parts of the world have different systems. And like I'm in Australia is just an open ended numbers from one to 38 or something. Whereas they get progressively harder. Oh, there it is right here, right there. Yeah. Climbing grade comparison. Oh, that's interesting to one. They all do it differently. It was because climbing culture grew up in all different parts of the world.

Speaker 3:          00:35:16       Right. And climbing culture I guess is a big part of Yosemite yet. Well, yeah. I mean climbing as a sport in the US is sort of birthed from you somebody, I mean the history of albinism or climate rock climbing anyway. Certainly comes from you. Somebody in the US. Is it just because the paths are so cool that it just drew people to it or. Yeah, partially. I mean, yeah, the summits are so striking and I think a lot of it also just had to do with, um, just culture because a big part of it was people from La and the bay area who probably had some sense of classical albinism from the Alps, you know, people who have traveled to some extent and then wanted to climb other mountains and then they happen to live near one of the most iconic areas in the world.

Speaker 3:          00:36:00       And so then, I don't know. But anyway, so it winds up being called the ascending decimal system. But um, but yeah, so basically it's the, the, it's categories of terrain, so one being walking on a normal trail to being like scrambling a little bit, three being like scrambling with your hands and feet up, you know, rocks and then fourth class being like sorta like climbing but easier and then fifth class being actual rock climbing. And so then it was five point one through nine depending on how hard things are, you know, so five point, one being pretty easy, five point nine being pretty hard, like you're rock climbing now and technical and then at a certain point that system wasn't adequate so they had to start adding, you know, fivepoint 10 and then they subdivided into Abcd and then five point 11 abcd and the five point 12.

Speaker 3:          00:36:43       And so now it's an open ended system that right now goes up to five slash 16 basically. Whoa. El Cap is really complicated. Yeah. But so el Cap is 12 d or five point 12 d or maybe five point 13 eight, which is the next grade up. Um, it's all sorted, but, so basically that means that it's, it's elite. Like that's very difficult and something that like a, obviously an average person can do, but it's definitely not close to the physical limit of what's been done in the world. Uh, but that's with a rope on and that's after you know, years of practice and what's the physical limit, like what is the peak of where right now the hardest grade in the world is 15 d, which is extremely hard. I mean, it's totally crazy, but so one guy, this guy has done one route that he called 15 d and so it hasn't been repeated so it's not like an established consensus, but there are several 15 seas in the world and there are many 15 bees in the world. Whereas this 15 d, it's in a cave in Norway.

Speaker 3:          00:37:39       I mean it's, um, yeah, that's the kind of the interesting thing about climbing grades and climbing difficulties that they're all spread around the world, the very specific clips because it requires just the right combination of, of angle and holds, you know, there have to be enough things to hold onto, but not too many else. It's easier. And so I for an elite climber and they're basically searching the world all the time, trying to find that right mixture of, of rock. Wow. What a strange existence. It's really, really nice. Yachts forgot. Unusual now when you hear about it, but it's also kind of elemental in a way, you know, because rocks are just out there and you're basically just going and exploring nature until you find the right kind of challenge. What? Yeah. There's. Got It. There's some sort of a primal satisfaction that comes from climbing something, right?

Speaker 3:          00:38:21       Yeah. Wow. There's a certain. Yeah, there's an elemental quality for sure. Where you're like, this is something that just exists in the world. And you just say you have this, this, this, this, this is Adam, Andrea, this check kid climbing, 15 odd commander coming out about it, I guess. No, it's already out. It's, it's a short online actually. Silence. Yeah. The route he put up, he called silence. But uh, if this is the film, just scrub all the way to the. Oh, that's the. Yeah. So you can see he's climbing feet first through some of it and it's totally extreme. It's so this Guy Adam, Andrea is, is for sure the strongest climber in the world right now. Like physical? Yeah. Physically. So He's, he put up the world's first 15 c and the first 15 d, so he's basically push the edge of difficulty for the last several grades and he's just freakishly strong.

Speaker 3:          00:39:05       Is that something that you would have to be to do what he's doing? Like A, a regular climber? Couldn't do what he's doing is almost like acrobatic involved. Yeah, we look at what he's doing right there. It's like, oh, that's. So this is the world's first 15. See? So slightly easier. He did this several years ago, but it's like, um, and then here I'm like, yeah, but that's where he has a rope, you know, and you trust that over and over and over. But yeah, he's, he's an amazing climber. He's really, he's like a polymath. He's like, he's graded every discipline. What else does he do? Well, so he. Have you heard at the dawn wall on Ocap? No, I'm so Tommy Caldwell. You know who he is. Another professional climber. Um, he's, he's, he was, I don't know. Yeah, he's basically one of America's best climbers. He did this route called the dawn wall, um, which is also a film in theaters or wasn't theaters last month is sort of random that to big con and films came out exactly the same time, but it was just one of those freak things.

Speaker 3:          00:40:02       But so the dawn wall was considered the hardest climb in the world to some extent. It's this thing, it was a seven year project for him up up the right side of El Cap. The thing I climbed on the left side. Oh Kathy, he comes something on the right side, which is much harder, but he was using a rope and put seven years of work into it. And um, anyway, years. Yeah. And then this Guy Adam, 100 who were watching a video of, he, uh, he did the second ascent and uh, he put like a month of work into it and repeated it and you're just like, whoa, he's really, really strong. Wow. So when you see a guy do something like that, does that make you think about doing it or do you go, well that's only something that someone can do with raw. With ropes. Oh yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:40:40       No, I mean there are whole categories of climate that can only be done with a rope because the moves are way too insecure. You fall off way too often. I mean anything that kind of fall off doing that. Oh, like hundreds or maybe even thousands of times. So for him to, for him to do something at the heart, I mean to, to climb at the very highest levels of, of human potential. I mean, so think about a gymnast or something that him right there. So He's free soloing? No, no, no. He has a harness on. He's got a rope right there. Yeah. No, I mean look at what he's holding his one finger. No, I think is the other one might be onto but, but it's basically like a tiny, tiny, tiny edge. This is the crux of one of the pitchers on the dawn wall.

Speaker 3:          00:41:20       That is so insane. That guy could probably crush your head by just grabbing it when certainly the, he has a certain ferocity, he has an intensity where you can try with like 115 percent just like, ah. So I'm pretty sure if he grabbed your head and I tried as hard as it would just pop like a little melon grip strength. He's holding on to such a tiny, tiny little things. Yeah, he's a, he's a very, very strong wow man. So a guy like that, when you see him do these paths, these paths or paths that you can only do with a rope? Yeah. Yeah. Does he free solo as well? I don't think he ever has, but it's not really his thing. And the thing that in some ways it's really hard to do both at a high level and um, I, I think or at least to some extent it's hard to do both at a high level because.

Speaker 3:          00:42:09       So for him, for him to climb something that hard, he needs that intensity. He needs a 115 percent effort. But if you're trying to free Solo, well you definitely should never be giving anything even remotely close to 115 percent effort or will die for sure. Yeah. Because you're so close to that razor edge of failure when you're trying that hard. But with freestyle and you have to always keep it sort of within your comfort zone because you don't want to die doing it. So I mean, I think that I've always sort of kept my personal, like you're on your personal barometer of effort. I sort of live between four and seven, let's say, or like three and a half and seven maybe. Where it's like you're never too relaxed but you're also never going to the absolute death or sort of like in the four to six is a sweet spot where you're like, I'm climbing, I'm having a good time.

Speaker 3:          00:42:51       But I'm not like trying too hard and I'm not relaxed. But. So somebody gotta monitor or Tommy Caldwell, like I've, I've climbed with Tommy a lot over the years. He's a great climber and I've really seen this because he had like, I've seen him just randomly fall off many times because he was, he just slept. He was like, Oh, I'm so relaxed. It's so easy. And then it's like, oh, I slipped and that's kind of like an effort of one where you're like, your body is so relaxed that if, if anything happens, then you fall and with, with a rope on, that's fine. In some ways that's the more efficient way to climb because you know, you're so relaxed most of the time that you're saving a lot of energy over all that every once in a while when you fall. It's like, who cares? The rope catches you.

Speaker 3:          00:43:25       It's no problem, but you have to trust those little things that you stick in the crowd. But that's all. So that's, I mean, that's. Yeah, that's, that's kind of like, what is he doing there? He's uh, he's counter pressure me his leg into this cracked arrest. He's basically like pushing his knee into the rock to, uh, in order to relax his arms from his whole body leaning backwards. Yes. So he's hanging upside down. Basically every muscle in his body is relaxed except for his calf and his calf is forcing his knee into the rock which holds them in place.

Speaker 3:          00:43:52       That is so insane. That photo is so insane that that's a really efficient way to rest, to rest, to rest. Your arms will be good. It's really hard to. Well, you know what I mean? For him it's like for him to be able to rest like that for one minute is an amazing way to rest your arms for a minute and then it sort of saps your core and it makes us cap really tired. Obviously. Now there's a guy like, does he lift weights or anything to prepare for these things? There's just no, he's doing it. He's, he's on his own program, but it's really climate specific. He's mostly doing things with his fingers and yeah, he's pretty jacked. Is that even him? That's crazy. That's a weird. Uh, yeah, it's the same. It's the same route. That's interesting. I've never seen that photo,

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       but I mean, I guess you just get jacked from doing that too though. Just constantly pulling yourself up. Yeah, for sure. There's a climbing wall just like local a kid's place and I told my daughter give her 100 bucks if she could make it all the way to the other side. It's pretty difficult and so she's become obsessed with trying to get over that to get 100 bucks. That's definitely Jack. I mean look at it. He's Jack. Your daughter's going to wind up super ripped. It's hard to do my like really? I tried to do it and I couldn't do it. I was like, wow, this is really hard. It's difficult to do. I bet. I bet if you. If you try it a bit. I mean just because you have such a background in movement and fitness and everything. I bet. I bet it wouldn't be that hard for, you know, instruction.

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       Yeah. I'm pretty heavy though. For someone who's short the that'd be an issue is hanging on $200. So in theory climbing should be more in your legs anyway. She'd be driving with your legs because no matter what, your legs are always bigger and stronger muscles in your arms. So that's always what drives you upward and then your arms should only be holding your weight in and keeping your, keeping you balanced over your feet basically. That's interesting. That's something that they figured out fairly recently with grappling over the last 10, 15 years with Jujitsu and things along those lines that your legs, you, it's really important to use mostly your legs when you're grappling. Totally. I can see that. I mean that's what's driving you forward and pushing the whole trolling your opponent and manipulating your opponent and doing stuff with your legs. Do you do anything to cross train?

Speaker 1:          00:45:58       Like not really, no other mountain sports, a little mountain biking or skiing or things like that. We do it for fun, for fun. And then um, the only real cross training and it was just sort of like a pushup and core type routine, you know, like opposition training just to maintain healthy, healthy body. Oh, because you're constantly pulling. Yeah, exactly. I'm always pulling for my sports. So then I tried to do a little bit of pushing and core just to make sure that things stay balanced out. Now, is that something you talk to a physical therapist about or. No, that's just. I mean that's just basic physiology. I mean if you only pull, you have to push sometimes throws you wind up all imbalanced and injured. Well, I saw the, one of the things in the film was when you were recovering from your ankle sprain and you know, you had said that you really hadn't been injured in years.

Speaker 1:          00:46:44       Then all of a sudden you have this girlfriend and she doesn't climb and you get injured. Yeah. Yeah. That actually is just free. Free timing. God luck. Yeah. It's just unfortunate because I think really it just shows that I've been really fortunate for 20 years that I've had very few injuries climbing and then, you know, at some point you just have a few in this. I mean that's just life to some extent, but when you do have something like that and you feel sort of the vulnerability of your tissue and your, do you think about like, Hey, what if this happened halfway up? Some fucking insane path? No, the, the bigger thing in the film, uh, I have a back injury earlier where I get lowered off the end of the rope and fall. I only fell maybe 10 or 12 feet, you know, sorta like the height of this, this room basically.

Speaker 1:          00:47:28       And, but I landed sort of like folded over this rock backward. It was like totally horrible, like these jagged good boulders and um, so I didn't go that far, but I was like, oh, you know, I got worked and it was really sobering because it made me realize that if I fell from 40 feet climbing, you know, you could, it could be. Yeah, I mean it'd be a disaster. You're basically are, it made me realize just how fragile my body is because I'm like, oh, I only fell a little tiny ways and it really hurt pretty bad. I was like, man, if you fell much further, you could, you could, anything could happen. Yeah. People step off stairs wrong and yeah. Yeah. It's very strange. The body's so fragile. It's really amazing. Well, it's funny, but it's so fragile. But then also so robust in some ways.

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       I mean, it's amazing what the human body can adapt to or withstand, but then yeah, and then some things just cannot. Yeah. That's why I was asking you about your age, like as you get older, are you seeing a difference in the way you recover? Are you seeing differences in the way you know, like what your body, what you feel like your potential is? I, yeah. It's hard to say. I think. Um, yeah. I don't know. I mean those are the tough questions. I mean, you know, I'm sure. Sure you think about this stuff too. Was a fighter a fighter at your age? Thirty three? He said. Yeah. That's when you start tailing off like winding down 34, 35 on a fighter, hits like 36. Like yikes. Is that, is that like old for fighter? That's pretty old. It's very rare. There's only a few guys who've been able to compete at a world class level past that.

Speaker 1:          00:49:02       And MMA. Randy coture stands out and boxing. Bernard Hopkins stands out. How old is the Floyd Mayweather? He's 40. Wow. Is he still considered like fighting an elite level? Well, you know, when he fought conor mcgregor, conor mcgregor was nowhere near his level because conor mcgregor wasn't really a box. He's on boxer and so floyd just kind of worked him. But uh, he hasn't really fought at a world class level for a couple of years because, you know, he beat Canelo Alvarez several years ago and made Canelo drop a ton of weight when he beat Manny Pacquiao. Manny Pacquiao was quite a bit past his prime and had a shoulder injury. So you probably dealing with like three years or so since he's fought like real world class competition. Huh? When you say you made them drop lunch, wait, does that mean like to. How does that work? Clever. You know, he, he wanted him to fight at a lower weight class, you know, because floyd really, floyd started off his career, I want to say at 1:30.

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       Then he fought at 1:45. Yeah. And you know, his real isn't any big. How big is it? At least a very small five, six, five, seven, maybe five, seven. Tiny little hands on. Very small hands. But certainly they hit very hard. Well, he's not a very fast, he's just a genius boxer. Probably one of the best defense, probably if not the best, definitely top two or three boxers of all time. It's only been really hit hard to the point where it's been wobbled like maybe like four, four times his entire career. It seems like that's the kind of box that you want to be. Exactly. You know what it'd be like the rocky Balboa styled, so that just gets beaten to death and then you want to be as boring really frigging watching NFL games with good defense and you're like, oh man. It's like not the team you want to watch, but it's probably the better team.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       Yeah, well especially with boxing because the consequences are so grave. If you hit a lot, there was a horrible video that I put up on youtube or on twitter rather than a retweeted. Someone sent me and it's boxers when they're young talking versus after injuries and you're watching, you're like, whoa. It's stunning. It's just like nfl stuff too. I mean, yeah, it's funny. I mean people talk about that with climbing. It's like, oh, that's such a dangerous sport, but the thing about rock climbing is that it's basically a completely safe sport right up until some kind of accident may happen and then then you potentially die. But so the thing is you can basically climb at a high level for 50 years and never have any issues or you could maybe die doing it, but it's kind of a fundamentally safe sport for the most part as opposed to what we're talking about, like fighting or a football or things like that were like, or even mountain biking where you're for sure going to get injured like no matter what, just by, just by playing the game, you know, like football and fighting, they creep up on you, like the injuries start to pile.

Speaker 1:          00:51:55       But basically just even in practice you are getting injured constantly, you know? And so it's, I mean that's Kinda messed up. It's just the price of entry is going to be freaking head injuries. Yeah. I went to a football game. You have the day high school football game. And um, when I was there, I, I had a really hard time watching it because everybody's cheering and um, and I was talking to my friend, I'm like, you're looking at brain damage. Yeah, no one's messed up here. These kids are getting brain damage and this is like a really nice private school where they pay a lot of money to get the kids into this program. And then the kids are playing football. I'm like, these are all getting brain damage. He goes, really? I go, oh, 100 percent. I go, do you see that collision? That's brain damage.

Speaker 1:          00:52:36       That's definitely brain damage. It might not be a lot. They might be okay, but how many of those do they do in a day? How many do they do? How many a month? How many are there? What are ways to human potential right there? I'm just like, well, it really is. I mean, the problem is it's such a grand part of our history and our culture, which doesn't really need to be. I mean, you know, football hasn't existed that alarm. Yeah. No, I agree. I mean, I'm not, I forgot. Shit, I watched a Rodeo from like very, very close basically like from the commentators box, like above the pens for the fourth of July Rodeo in Wyoming like two summers ago. And that was something I was like, this is messed up. I mean, and I'm not like huge animal rights guy but I'm vegetarian obviously and I sort of care. And I was like, Oh, you know, you're kind of abusing these animals for sport and that's like, that doesn't sit that well with me. But what was even worse,

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       I was like, all these young men are getting worked just like for the entertainment is totally like Roman gladiator type stuff. And I was just like. And it's weird because it's so cultural, you know, because, and, and you know, I mean I can, I can empathize because obviously I'm doing something that's also sort of bloodsport he to some extent and, and sort of for the same reason, you know, you're a teenage do look into do something interesting and engaging that's, that will hopefully get you laid, you know, like you just want to. I mean, if you're from small town Wyoming and you're like, oh, I'm good at riding bowls, like that's for sure going to be your path. And I'm like, oh, that's just too bad that that's your path. It's a path. I mean we watched this guy get fricking thrown off this bowl and um, and I think he was fine, you know, he landed on the ground, but then the bowl for Canada was charging him and the guy like, I've never seen human terror, like he basically just turned and ran as fast as he could, but he ran straight into this post, like headfirst into this frickin steel posts, like the edge of the.

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       Because he just didn't, you know, it was like the bolts coming at him. He like turns it around and you basically like knocks himself out against this post. And thankfully the clowns distracted the bowl. And then the paramedics, he believed there was a brigade ambulance basically parked on the other side of the fence from what you read do. And so they basically like lift him over and put them straight on the stretcher and take them away. You know what I was like dude, and you know the crowds all like, ah, and you're just like that guys like messed up like that, you know, everything about it made me like, feel kind of gross, you know? Yeah. It's not like I would never want to pay to watch somebody hurt themselves or just like, I dunno. Well it's weird that that's culturally acceptable, but like bullfighting is not. Yeah. When they're totally. Yeah. Bull riding. It's like they're fricking tasing the bowls that are like, aren't they tying off their balls and they're doing all kinds of things and some bad things too though. People argue that the polls have great lives, you know, they feed them well and they get a lot of exercise and they're very happy bowls and you're like, dude, I'm pretty sure they'd rather be roaming the open plains, like inseminating cows, you know? Yeah. That's weird. Justification. Yeah. We had a guy on fear factor

Speaker 2:          00:55:18       for once that was a professional rodeo guy and his shoulder was like a topographic map and he had so many scars in his shoulder and he told me, you show that would just pop out just like he could just pop it out left and right from just being destroyed like Ford by bolts falling and getting it ripped apart or riding bowls. Oh yeah. Yeah. I just, I just don't get that just wasn't working anymore. I mean he had a bunch of surgeries and they tried to screw it back together and tighten things down, but it was just destroyed.

Speaker 3:          00:55:49       So I'm sure. I'm sure a bull rider would look at free soloing. It'd be like, what a crazy dude. You know, everybody looks at another sport and they're like, that's great. And honestly I look at fighting and I'm like, that seems totally outrageous. I'm like, why would you want some other dude beat you to death in a cage? I'm like, that's great. He's outrageous. It is outrageous. But if you can get good enough where you can avoid getting damage. Yeah. And then the tool to land the damage, it's Kinda the same, but even landing the damage to a certain extent, you're like, oh, you're hurting somebody else for the pleasure of the crowd. You're like, that's Kinda messed up. You know, it's a weird feeling. Knocking someone is one of the

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       weirdest feelings because a part of you is happy that it's not you, but part of you is like looking down with that guy that's just got flatlined and you're like, Whoa, that could have been made. How much to fighters? Like, hold back, you know, because I feel like you kind of have to like go to the death. But then if you actually like punch somebody so hard, they died or something. I mean obviously you'd feel horrible or it will. You don't look back at all. But that's insane. But. So it's like you don't hold back at all, but then if you actually killed somebody when you feel horrible. It's very rare that someone dies in mixed martial arts, believe it or not. Well yeah. No, I mean I know that, but it's possible. Definitely possible. And it has happened and it's sort of like it has happened very, very rarely in mixed martial arts.

Speaker 1:          00:57:06       Never in the UFC. But in boxing it happens more often. And one of the reasons why it happens more often in boxing because you're only punching in, then you're taking people down. Yeah. People are tapping out cause they're paying them. Well. It's also there's more options to defend yourself. You're not just getting battered against the ropes. They're also nowadays much better at stopping a fight when a fighter's clearly compromised when they're. They're really fucked up. In the old days they used to let guys just get battered. They're just a box that doesn't sit well with me. I'm just like, ah, but that's what I'm not a fighter. Well that's the thing about climbing is there's this real elemental appeal to just you and the mountain and it's nature and it's beautiful and it's very peaceful and calm. It's like so different than having thousands of people screaming at you as you punch someone in the face over and over.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       Just like, dude, that's just not my scene. Well, did you see the economy? Mcgregor could be abnormal gromit off fight where there's the big fight outside the cage. Always. That's the thing where the guy vaults out of the cage and like starts bawling. I was like, yeah, it's like wwe or whatever it was. When did they start breaking tables over people crazier than that because it was real. Yeah, exactly. I was like, this is totally outrageous, but what's funny is it became chaos because a fight erupted outside of the parameters of the fight. It was just more fighting, fighting. You have like, this is what we paid for, this isn't okay. Right. Everybody's like fighting in the cage is fine. This is lovely, but because out of the cage, oh my God, he's out in the wild. That's like out in the world fighting. Isn't that kind of messed up?

Speaker 1:          00:58:40       Yeah. It's definitely like he's a professional fighter. He's fighting. That's what he does. It's weird though, the whole list and then this is coming from someone who's been involved in this my whole life. It's weird. It's. I, I absolutely see all the arguments against it and yet you still want to go to trader when people in the face. I don't punch anybody in the face anymore. I still choke people. But uh, I think that seems totally fun. The thing about the Jujitsu aspect of it is you, you really can tap out and stop and you don't really get hurt. You get hurt training. Jujitsu's accidental for the most part. Especially when you train, you're actually better off training with a black belt than you are with a white belt doorway because. Yeah, no, I get that blacks, they have more control on, so they'll be fine with you.

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       They'll just, they'll just tap you and yeah, it was a white ball accident and kicks you in the face and you're like, ah, spark really strong. Especially if you get a white belt is a crossfitter, is fucking jacked. Really strong guide. Just wants to. They probably were just grappling and then as a harm came out and I don't know what to do with it, so I threw it away. I don't know. Yeah. Really unskilled guy who's extremely strong, who's learning technique, and it's also like a spazz is very dangerous to roll. Uh, so yeah, you don't want to teach me to Jujitsu. It's not me telling you if you did it with me we'd be fine. But if you did it with someone who's a real beginner, who's, you know what I'm saying? I'm a strong beginner, strong grip and no idea what I'm doing. Just like, yeah, book. The real problem would be if we were both beginners yoga, that would be the real problem. Like a strong spazz is not really not going to work against the black belt. That's a go. That's the learning curve for climate and who you don't want to. Beginners going out and trying to climb a mountain together.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       I would worry about that. Like if you're climbing, do you ever climb? Like is there a chain like one person in front of you? Like when you. Yeah, when you climb up the rope, it's basically two people. One goes out first and then brings up the second because you're limited by the length of the rope. So basically one person, because at the end of the rope brings up the next person, that person that climbs through brings it up the second, so you dependent upon the holes that they put in when they put those bolts into the cracks and bolts, bolts and things are put in by the first essential list. So the very first person to have ever climbed the route, but then everybody thereafter is able to just clip there. Their equipment into the bolts are a use preestablished anchors, things like that. Oh. So all the, all the roots are already established and you can read a book that shows all the different routes.

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       So like El captain has something like 112 different roots of it and wow. And of those hundred and 12, only 15 or so of them can be free climbed, which is different than free soloing. Free climbing, meaning just using your hands and your feet and you're still using a rope. You're still clipping into protection as you go, but you're only using your hands and your feet to get you up as opposed to like putting gear in. And then pulling on the gear which would be considered cheating. So of the 100 routes on Ocap, something like 90 of them you have to pull on the hardware, you have to like clip little ladders into it and step on, you know, you have to hammer pecans in and then clip into them and stand on and then hammer another town and step on. That is no flip for.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       Yeah, there's just nothing to hold onto. It's too hard. So then, so then there, yeah, something like 10 or 15 free climbing routes where you can climate. And so with my big goal of trying to free Solo El cap to climbing without a rope, I was limited to just those 10 or 15 routes that are possible to climb. Just with your hands and feet. And how did you establish the one that you wanted to proceed on? Yeah, so basically I just wanted them doing the easiest one because I'm basically, it's really hard to free climb El cap by any means. And so the easiest one wound up being the most secure. The best one for me. How many people have done it? Will Free Solo or free climb free solo freestyle. I'm, I mean, nobody only web the only one. Yeah, I mean that's why there's

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       the film and everything. It's, it's a. and nobody's ever even thought about it, you know, nobody's considered. It's not like something that people are trying to do. Now that you've done it. Other, other people that are considering it. I really don't. I mean, I think it's almost more the opposite now that I've done it. People are like, Whoa, I don't need to do that every. I mean, there's nobody even playing this game right now. Really. There aren't that many high end free soloist right now. How many other um, to one or something really. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if there are any others really right now there's this guy brad go right. And then the American guy who's been freestyling at a pretty high level, but definitely he's a really good friend of mine, so I'm not slandering him. But, um, but definitely at a very different level than, than, uh, like he would never even dream of selling all cab.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       So he's sort of starting out was not that he's starting out, I mean he's a very good climber, he's been climbing with long time and he's done all kinds of very difficult things. But in terms of free soloing, I think he just doesn't need to push it as that hard. So he's almost like he dabbles in free soloing. Yeah. Well I mean I dabble on free soloing as well. I mean most of them I'm climbing with my friends doing other things, you know, I mean I think most almost all climbers only dabbling free. So free soloing is sort of like one discipline of climbing. Like when we were talking earlier about the Olympics, having multiple disciplines, um, you know there are many types of climbing and most climbers do all of them to some extent and free soloing always represents sort of this small specialty like extra style.

Speaker 3:          01:03:43       So you do free climbing and then you also do the kind of climbing where you have to put in those posts and stand on them. Our aid climbing, artificial climate. So I free climb, I aid climb. Sometimes I don't like to because it's too much work, it's too much like construction, you know, you're like nailing things and standing on. It's like engineering, but I do that because sometimes that's what it requires to get up big mountains and we do that. And you nail things and stand on them. Do you take them out as well? Yeah, the second person takes them out so the one person uses them to get up and then once the rope is security above, then the second person joins them and remove them all. And then you have all your gear back and then you're able to do it again for the next section.

Speaker 3:          01:04:17       How much weight is that stuff? Well, it depends where it can be a lot. And certainly back in the day when people were doing the first ascents of El Cap, I mean it's something like 40 pounds or 50 pounds of iron hanging off him. Jesus. Nowadays it's a lot lighter and you can use better gear. But um, but yeah, I mean it's a lot, but that's kind of the appeal of free climbing or even free soloing means that you have nothing on you. Now, how secure is that stuff that you're hammering in there? It depends. It depends. I mean there's certainly stories of people falling and ripping all this stuff back up, but, but, but sometimes that's okay because if you're, if you're thousands of feet off the ground, you can take that hundred foot fall and not touch anything and it's fun. Oh yeah. But still not really earlier this summer, a county on the thing.

Speaker 3:          01:04:58       Yeah, I mean it's all, it's all well founded. I mean, you just got to trust it. Now, earlier this summer I was talking about Tommy Caldwell, one of the best climbers in the country. So the two of us did the speed record on ocap cap earlier this year. And so that's the two of us are tied together. We're using a rope, we're using equipment, but we're anything goes, you're cheating as much as you can, as it trying to get from the bottom of the cap to the top as fast as possible. This is on a different route than the one that I presented in the film. And so, um, we were trying to go sub two hours and we ultimately did it and 1:58 and it was, it was pretty awesome and we were really psyched. But along the way Tommy took 100 foot fall at one point where he just, I was talking about him with the whole one to 10 effort.

Speaker 3:          01:05:36       He was climbing something that's really, really easy and he was probably giving an effort of like two and he just slipped, you know, and I was like, oh, but anyway, he freakin whipped. You felt like a hundred feet just straight down the wall. Didn't touch anything because I'll. Cap is like a very clean vertical sheet rock. How long does it take to fall? One hundred feet. That's like several. Yeah, several seconds. No, no, no, no, like four or five or something. But you accelerated very quickly to three long enough to be like, oh my God, I'm going to die. No, no, no. Long enough. So the reason he fell so far is because we were doing this sort of complicated maneuvers. Uh, normally I would have a blade advice on. I basically, it would be attached to the rope earlier to like catch him, but I'd taken my blade of ice off and I was just tied into the end.

Speaker 3:          01:06:18       So basically he fell on all the slack, whipped through until it hit me at the end of the rope. But so when he yelled, I basically had time to be like, oh my God, he's falling, like brace for impact. Like knowing that in a second the rope is going to come tight against the end that I'm tied into basically jerk me. But then thankfully there's enough drag and the system that it didn't jerk me off the stance that I was on or else I would have gotten pulled like 15 feet across the wall and it was all messed up. So when he's falling and you're, you're realizing that you're going to get yanked by his fault or you like digging into the, you know, basically I was like, oh my God, you know, it was like brace yourself. Like I was in this position. I was actually facing out away from the wall, like facing out towards the meadow because I was in an open corner.

Speaker 3:          01:07:01       Like if you look at the corner of the room, imagine one leg on each side facing outward, like pushed into this position because it's like I was about to have to untie my knot and retire and do some things. And so I was basically like already to do some things and all of a sudden I hear that he's falling and I was like, oh my God. And then like I was able to just sorta like stick in there Jesus. But my point is just that taking big fall. I mean if you trust your equipment and everything, it can be okay to take big falls like that. You obviously try to avoid them because you know, had he hit a ledge or something, then potentially he could have died, but because it was, it was clean there it was. Okay. So if he was in a situation where there was a slight angle and he fell that far, that's where it's really dangerous.

Speaker 3:          01:07:41       I mean worst case scenario would be if he fell 100 feet and 75 feet down there was alleged sticking out how half the width of this table because then you would just clip it, you'd break both your legs, everything would explode and then you'd still know what do you do if you fall and you break something and you're halfway up. We'll do so. Okay. Same route. The nose of El Cap, which we were trying to do the speed record on this friend of mine who I actually previously held the speed record with this older guy, Hans flooring, um, who actually wrote the book how to speed climb that. I learned how to speed come from many years ago. So he freaking exactly what I'm describing. Sort of worst case scenario. He took this 20, probably a 22 foot fall, but he was unlucky enough, which is totally fine.

Speaker 3:          01:08:21       He had a rope. You had gear. Everything worked exactly the way it's supposed to. He just fell always, which, which is normal, but the bummer was that there was a little ledge, probably twice the size of that box right there, like that little wooden box, just kind of this little thing sticking out from the wall about this far that basically he fell 20 feet hit that, broke both of his ankles and then and then went off in another two feet and so the rope caught him and you know, the fall was exactly as expected. All his gear held. Everything's totally normal except that he happened to hit that thing right at the apex of the full force of his fall. You know, I hid that legend two feet below. It wouldn't matter at all. He would just hidden, jumped off into space, but because you'd already fallen 20 feet, broke both his ankles and then he was kind of horrible.

Speaker 3:          01:09:02       I was actually up higher on the wall that day. I'd come in from above to repel in and work on something and I heard him yelling, but I thought he was just hooting and hollering like, hey, you know, how's it going type deal. And then I like it climbed out to the summit and then when I'd hiked halfway back down I got a voicemail from him saying that, um, you know, being like, oh, hey, it's Honda. I think I've just broken my, my tip fib. Um, you know, basically like, oh, can you, can you help her with her? He'd already called search and rescue and so rescue is already mobilized, but search and rescue in Yosemite, it's really lead. They're really fast but it's still sort of by the books, you know, it still takes kind of a lot of time. And so I was like, Oh man, like maybe I should run back up and repel down and like help my buddy repel down the wall again or something.

Speaker 3:          01:09:42       Try to like get them out of here faster just because when search and rescue mobilize, it's like a long time. And I was like, if he's in a lot of pain that, that sucks, you know, um, there as it, I really hesitated. I wound up calling search and rescue and talking to through them to see if there was anything I could do to help. But ultimately I want them just going down because there wasn't really anything for me to do. So he's essentially just suspending for awhile waiting for them to get them. Yeah. So he basically just sat on the ledge with two broken legs for, you know, six hours or 12 hours or something. And then eventually they managed to haul him up to the summit and then I think they helicoptered him off the next morning because it was already dark by then. Yeah, I know it was kind of horrible.

Speaker 3:          01:10:19       But he sort of recovered by now it's been, it's been five months or something. So he's back at it, always climbing. He's the manager of a climate. He's, you know. Yeah. Well, I mean it's two broken bones. I mean worse, it seems like. No, super grim. It was like. But that's an example of sort of worst case, you know, just bad luck. Well that's actually not worst case right now that. Yeah, that's not worst case. That's just bad luck. Yeah. That's like when you're sitting there, if you're sitting there hanging off a ledge like that with two broken ankles for six hours. I mean that must be grim, but I don't get to you the super groom swelling and yeah. So I think he and his partner actually repelled down 100 feet to a slightly bigger ledge so that he could lay on it and elevate his legs. And then I think there were some other climbers around that game, a jacket, you know, so he gets sort of bundle up and like lay there and sort of manage. But yeah, I mean it seems extremely character building the life you choose. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's really, I'm that, that actually kind of makes me feel really bad. You could just. Because the like that kind of thing is really close to home because he's a friend and it's just so bad. Yeah. Not can only imagine. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:11:27       When, when you think about your life and you think about this stuff that you do, do you do, is there a point where you feel like you won't do it anymore or a point where you feel like you want free solo anymore? Or do you look at like your friend who you were talking about who's older, who's still free soloing and doing difficult paths? Do you think this is just your life forever?

Speaker 3:          01:11:48       Um, no. I don't know. I honestly, I'm not sure. I don't think it's my path forever necessarily just because there just aren't always bigger and harder things to do. You know what I mean? El Cap represented sort of the end of this very long road for me. I mean I, I sold many, many things that we're all sort of leading towards El Cap and then I finally did that and that. And at least right now I can't really imagine anything more inspiring to me. Uh, in terms of reselling, I mean there are plenty of other climate challenges that I'm interested in. Like I was just saying, doing the speed record is something that I did this summer, but

Speaker 2:          01:12:23       is this like winning a big hand in Vegas where you're just like, okay, we got all the money

Speaker 3:          01:12:27       the fuck out of here? No, because that's that. That is too much luck. You know what I mean? It's like, it's more like realizing a life dream and you're sort of like, okay, yeah, boundary I've seen. But I mean, you know, it's, it's a similar idea where you're like, okay, I will. No, it's not even. I mean it's. Yeah. Yeah, it's a bad analogy just in terms of like, no, no more big crazy risks. Yeah. But that's the thing is that it's not even, I was never seen as a big crazy risk, you know, I wasn't what was or wasn't rolling the dice. I was sort of training for this thing and then I did it and I'm just not sure if there's a bigger thing that's worth more effort, you know? So I don't know. I mean, uh, you know, as you've seen the film, like our relationship with my girlfriend and she's great and we have this nice life together and there's so much else in climbing and um, you know, I mean maybe I'll never, never seek out big free soloing challenges again. I mean, we'll see

Speaker 2:          01:13:16       now you're still relatively young in terms of life itself. Do you, do you think maybe there could be something that you would enjoy as much as you enjoy climbing?

Speaker 3:          01:13:26       Well, I mean, so no matter what I'll climb my whole life. I mean, I forgetting, I love climbing. I mean even on the phone here, I'm climbing in the gym everyday and just for the movement of it just to enjoy climbing. But, um, I don't know, I'm, I, I have a foundation that I've worked with for the last five or six years supporting solar around the world. And so, um, I could see putting more and more effort into that. I mean, that's something that satisfying in a way that climbing sort of isn't because it actually has a real tangible impact on the world. You know, mean climbing is really fulfilling personally, but when it's all said and done, it's like it's just me going rock climbing, it doesn't really matter, but um, but at least working with the foundation, it's like actually doing something real.

Speaker 3:          01:14:03       What is your foundation? Just the foundation, but it's a, we've been supporting solar all this. I mean if you want the version is basically uh, you know, I was looking for some way to do something positive in the world. So I was looking to support environmental projects and then I was like, there's no real point in supporting environmental projects that don't also support in like increased standard of living that like help people in need. And that sort of led me to solar projects basically solar energy access. And so that's what we in sport in the last five, six years. And so what do you do with this project was so domestically it was, it mostly, it's just been my way of donating my money to two other projects that support solar. So I'm domestically in the US, I've been supporting this group, grid alternatives for example, I'm in.

Speaker 3:          01:14:48       So, I mean, I've done a few ins, installations with them in, in Sacramento, in my hometown were basically low income family, just gets a free home solar system on their house and so it saves them the energy bills, but then also in terms of carbon emissions is just, it's good for the planet, you know, slowly greening the grid. But um, and then the bigger potentially the bigger impacts have been projects we've been supporting in Africa, I'm just give access to solar lantern, solar lights, being able to charge cell phones basically like small scale systems that was just a panel, a battery and a few led lights and an iphone charger. But um, but those kinds of things can fundamentally change somebody's life because, you know, east Africa people can spend up to a quarter of their income on kerosene light just to light their home, which is totally outrageous.

Speaker 3:          01:15:32       I mean imagine spending that percentage of your income just to have light after dark, you know, and like an equatorial regions of the earth. It's dark for 12 hours a day. I mean, imagine if when the sun goes down, your productive hours are done, you're just like, I'm just going to sit in the dark for 12 hours. It's crazy, you know? Yeah. I mean there, there are a billion people on earth living without access to power and I mean it's hard not for. I mean I kind of see that as a waste of human potential to some extent. Like it's just an unfortunate thing to think there are so many people living without access to power. I mean, it's crazy. It is crazy. It's really crazy in California that there's not more solar. When you think about how often it's sunny here, he. Yeah, no, I mean it's, it's totally that.

Speaker 3:          01:16:12       I mean at least it's, it's growing very quickly in California at least. But I mean really solar should be powering the whole or I mean enough sunlight hits the earth every. I don't know the terms. It's every like 10 or 15 minutes basically to power the earth for like the year. If you're able to harness all that energy, just kind of like. It's just such a cleaner, simpler way of of powering the earth, you know? Yeah. It really is. And I mean one can only hope that that's going to. It's going to keep continue. It's gonna continue to evolve and the thing, the thing that drives me absolutely crazy is that it. It's totally obvious that in 100 years the earth will be run through solar and things like that because there's just so much energy spilling onto the earth and it's free. And so the technology is only improving.

Speaker 3:          01:16:58       Everybody's adopting it like in 100 years, no question. Everything will be run from the sun. The thing that drives me insane is that there's so much resistance to it from utilities, from, from consumer ignorance, from whatever else, but people just don't totally get it and sort of opposed to it. And so, you know, half the world will be dragged kicking and screaming into the future and you're sort of like, if you just embrace it and get there in 15 years instead of 100 years, all, all the arguments about climate change, all the arguments about, you know, environmental degradation, all those kinds of things will be mitigated to a large extent. And you sort of like, is there a downside to that? You know, like even if you don't believe in climate change, even if you know, you denial the science behind it, you think it's all bs. It's like, is there really a downside to just adopting the future sooner? For me it's like, yeah, it's like one of those things where you're sort of like, if it's going to happen eventually, let's just do it now and save all the fricken hassle again. There.

Speaker 2:          01:17:47       I think it's the momentum of the current system. It's very difficult for people to just abandoned established ways of doing things, especially down. We're so hooked on fossil fuels.

Speaker 3:          01:17:57       I know, but like it's just such a bummer that the status quo is such a thing. You know, people are like, oh, that's the way we do it. Let's just keep doing that. And it's just weird because there's so many things in life, the change so frequently, you know, like I mean the world is constantly changing and you're like, let's just embrace the changes that matter the most and just do them faster. Well, you're talking about was a guy who

Speaker 2:          01:18:14       he lives in a van and climbs rocks business people that have thousands and thousands of employees and millions if not billions of money of dollars invested in these things. Yeah. Well, yeah, that's the problem with parents system. I know it's just too bad. Yeah, but it's. It is, but it's inevitable. I agree with you. It's inevitable that we will embrace it and change. I think

Speaker 3:          01:18:37       that's almost more frustrating though, is because it's inevitable and yet it's going to be dragged out so long. You're sort of like, why can't people just embrace the inevitability of it and just

Speaker 2:          01:18:44       move forward? Well, I think they slowly are, but things like that take time. I think one, one big thing is going to be if they can ever figure out a way to solar power cars as you're driving them, so you never really have to concern yourself. I'll ever be a thing. Well, fisker figured out how to do it with your stereo. They figured out how to do it with your radio system and different kind of car. It is, it's like a lot less energy, but it's just the roof panel. The roof panel, isn't that, didn't we? Um, they, they are a weird company though. That's the company that, um, many years ago there was a big storm that hit the east coast and they had a bunch of cars parked at a dock and they all exploded when the water hit them and they realize, wait, wait, wait, wait. You can't get your things drenched in water. Like when the water hit a certain level, like they had a severe flaw and so they burst into flames and exploded. And there's this whole like doc filled with these fisker Karma Karmas that blew up. And they called them Karmas, which has even more hilarious. You watch it exploding. That's pretty bad. That's all bad all the way around. Yeah. I think they've since fixed that, but yeah, it was a big flaw.

Speaker 3:          01:19:56       So that's. I was just actually reading, I was reading this business management book, but um, if you're talking about the Ford Pinto with a freaking gas tanks too close to the back bumper is based in your gas tank, protected by nature

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       and you know, speaking of exploding cards, but that actually I think killed lots of people because they were actually put into production and then there are tons of accidents and the car's explode and you're just like, man, that's been a bad decisions that an auto manufacturing. Yeah, the Pinto was a disaster. It wasn't good. But yeah, I think what the, what they're capable of doing right now, I think you're right. I don't think you can power a car with solar panels completely. I mean, you certainly can from your house. That was their initial claim when they announced it, that it would power the whole car and everyone was like, that's bullshit. You know, that's definitely a bullshit. I mean, just. Yeah. Yeah. I have to go two years ago they said they could power the whole car with the roof. August of 2016. Huh? I'm trying to find a updates, but that seems.

Speaker 1:          01:20:54       That seems totally outrageous because also, I mean the future of cars is born like a smaller car with no, like a glass roof, like Tesla style where it's sort of a initial ad right here. So a roof create enough energy to power the car. No other vehicles sold in the US has ever offered this capability. What I mean, so that might be true if it just sat parked in the sun for 12 hours and then he drove home run. I mean the driveway. You worked at night charges all day and you and your commutes really short. Yeah. But the numbers don't really don't work well. You would know better than anybody if you're involved in solar. I don't know, but I mean there's solar panels of today. I mean, I have a buddy of mine that does a lot of backpacking and he carries around this, uh, it's like a foldable solar charger for his phone and he folds it up and lays it out and then puts a charger there and then he uses that charger to charge his phone, but he doesn't like he'll go 20 plus days with justice thing you want me to.

Speaker 1:          01:21:51       So I mentioned our expedition to Antarctica last winter, so that's 24 hours of sunlight because you're in Antarctica and in their summer and our entire expedition was run from solar and so we'd actually taken a generator and the other guys on the trip for oil, for the generator basically. And so it wasn't gonna work. And so we're like, oh, I guess we'll have to try to use the solar, which has sort of been our backup system. And uh, it actually, we ran the whole trip on solar and everything worked in, so they were filming. So there are a bunch of cameras, a bunch of batteries, laptops, backing up drives. And then, uh, they were flying a drone quite a bit for aerial footage. Is all kind of beautiful, so I mean they basically ran this whole operation off solar. One of the, one of the camera guys has got Pablo, he's a good friend.

Speaker 1:          01:22:29       Mine. I'm basically just had to wake up every two hours to move the panels around the tent as the sun tracks around this guy, you know, so that it's always in full sun. But um, and he had to sleep with the batteries and things to make sure things stay warm enough. But otherwise, I mean, but that's, I mean because it's really cold. Yeah. It's funny because you put your laptops and stuff into coolers, like in the ice chest to keep them insulated enough to stay warm as opposed to cold water because the outside temperature is so cold. But it was cool though because you know, that way we didn't have to run this like loud, stinky, annoying generator in like you just have your panels working fulltime. Yeah. That's one of the weird things about like Tesla's when you drive it in and they're like, yeah, no, it's awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       Yeah. So much more peaceful. Yeah. I mean, but that's the future. It's like if you imagine a city that's all silent electric cars, no emissions. I mean imagine how much more pleasant the pedestrian experiences when they, when it's not like diesel exhaust right next to you on the city streets. Yeah. You don't hear the car that runs you over or you know, but you still do though because uh, something like 30 percent of the noises, the tires. It's like you still hear cars. Yeah. But, but it's just so much more mellow. You don't hear like an engine like ripping right by you. Yeah. I think it's inevitable that we figured out a way that you can just power everything from solar and including cars as you're driving them. I mean, don't make sense as the technology improves mean. Yeah, we'll see. We'll see. I mean there's development in a solar film sort of in windows like so imagine an office building where the windows are all producing power.

Speaker 1:          01:23:54       So I mean if you think about that with a car, if it's just like a glass dome over you, but it's all sort of producing power. No, that'd be. I mean it's pretty amazing. I have a watch that was on solar power. That's not a lot of power, but still, I mean, you don't really need any batteries for Casio. Yeah, I do. When I was a kid, I'd want to. Yeah, that's pretty. That's pretty straightforward though. It's a small amount of power that it's drawing. When you got involved in this, um, how much preparation did you do? I mean, what, what was, what was the motivation for the foundation? Yeah. Um, I mean honestly, like I said, I was just looking to do something positive for the world and so exploring options you will and so I was going to start donating significant percentage of my income to, to environmental nonprofits and then I decided that I should do it in sort of a public facing way in, in the form of the foundation just because I felt like I'm never going to have nearly as much money as, as real philanthropic organization, you know, like the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Speaker 1:          01:24:49       Like I'll never have it. I'll never have real dollars like that, but I do sort of have this platform like some sort of public persona, whatever. And so I was like, well, at least if I donate things that I can sort of leverage that in the right way to contribute, I don't know, basically try and maximize the good that I'm doing. And so, um, yeah, so then I just started researching organizations that I felt like we're doing great work and that led me to solar basically does most of your income come from sponsors and from public appearances, like how it was mostly sponsors and then it sort of has shifted into sponsors and sort of one off things. So like, um, I published a book a few years ago and so there's an advanced from that and like the film has made a little money, um, the random little things in the now it's also sort of split with corporate speaking type commercial opportunities as well.

Speaker 1:          01:25:36       So sponsorship is still probably the biggest thing for me. So like the northface been my biggest sponsor, um, and most important sponsor for me. But then now it's sort of split between a bunch of different sources, just sort of public speaking things have these corporate appearances. You just go and get, just talk to them about free solo climbing and yeah, talk to them about climate. Talking about preparation or I mean depends on what somebody needs. Really. It depends what the organizations I've spoken to a bunch of a venture capital firms about risk taking and risk management or how that's interesting, you know, so they just look at you as like sort of an inspiration to mix things up for the company. Yeah, I mean I'd like to think that it's a slightly more interesting topic than the average business speaker, you know, I mean it's certainly more beautiful images, you know, like if I, if I give a nice slideshow and chat for a bit, it's um, you know, I mean it's beautiful, it's different and um, but I think that it still gets back to some of the same elemental issues, you know, talking about the.

Speaker 1:          01:26:29       Yeah, I mean how do you manage risk in your life and what's worth it and how do you choose it's, it's a smart move to for company to just kinda like very the kind of input that gets to the, the, the employees like give them something that's kind of spectacular and interesting and you know really well now when you look at the future, do you, do you have a map of what you would like to be doing? Do you, are you just sort of enjoying your experience here or do, do you have grand plans? I don't really have grand plans. I mean I've never really had a grand plan. It's always been that I love climbing. I want to do it well. I want to push myself and I think that's kind of my grand plan. I mean I'm a, I'm still trying to be a better climber.

Speaker 1:          01:27:13       I'm still trying to grow the foundation, do something more significant through it. I'm actually hired a full time executive director this year, this woman who's running a me, which is kind of awesome. So we're actually sort of ramping it all up a little bit. That was slightly in response to the film because I sort of figured that, you know, this is like a moment that I should try to take advantage of and use it to do something more positive and so, so that's sort of exciting for me and um, it's definitely not a grand plan, but it's, you know, it's just sort of all incremental incremental progress. So when you're doing all these climbs, you have a lot of time when you're, it takes time to do these things. So was this, when you start thinking about these ideas about thinking about like how much you enjoy being out here in nature and what I'm caring about the environment for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:27:56       Yeah, for sure. I mean I spend most of my time in the most beautiful places on earth. I mean, spending most of my time in national parks and public lands in general. And so I'm in all these beautiful places and it's like, yeah, I mean I care about them. I went to, you know, if I have a family someday, I want to be able to take my kids to the same places and have them appreciate the land in the same way. I mean, yeah, so like you send of the last five years for can the entire forest is basically died from pine beetles, will all the pine trees have basically died because pine beetles and so like just in the last five years, let's say the Yosemite Valley floor has sort of transformed from like a dense pine forest to sort of this open oak forest. It's like totally different character because all the pine trees have died and then they've been cutting them all down to reduce fuel load.

Speaker 1:          01:28:37       So they're basically logging trucks with pine trees, leaving the park nonstop, which you know, which I'm, which I totally support. I'm not like anti logging the dead trees because like you may as well use them if they're already dead. And I definitely don't want to see so many value all burst into flames. So it makes sense, but at the same time, I mean, you know, that's a real, that's a very direct result of climate. Gender mean it's 10 years of drought in California combined with, with shorter winters. It's like just have these beetles decimating the entire forest and I don't know, I mean that's, that sucks, you know, like I don't, I don't want to see the whole forest die and it's not an invasive beetle or is it a beetle invasive invasive in that, uh, I don't know specifically with you seminar, I could be wrong about this, but with a lot of the pine beetle problems in, in Colorado, it has more to do with shorter winter and warmer temperatures because normally the larva would die through the winter.

Speaker 1:          01:29:26       They would freeze. Um, but you know, basically they're not freezing in to the same extent. And so the population explodes and then you wind up with all the trees dying while we were there. And we were in big bear a few years back when they were having a real issue with it and they were having real significant fire scares young. It was, it was nerve wracking. No, I mean you, somebody who was like on fire for most of the summer. It was this crazy for the whole southern part of the park was like burning for months and that's, you know, I mean fire is a natural part of the ecosystem and that, you know, to some extent your life that's normal, but it's like it's not normal right now because the fuel load is so high. It's like so dry. It's just, it's too much, you know, and I just would love for my kids someday to be able to appreciate the park the way I have for so long and I just don't want to see you don't burn.

Speaker 1:          01:30:08       Yeah. When I was, when we were in big bear, that's my feeling. It was, it was, it was sad that you're seeing something that was probably this rich green, lush forest that's now really weird gray and drive. But it was also like you're around kindling, like you're basically in a big stack of dry wood before it gets lit on fire and you're surrounded by it and there's enough. It hits up there. It's, I mean I've, we've been evacuated where I live several times, twice, actually come close a couple of other times and it's, it's terrifying because southern California when it goes, it goes and there's just no stopping it. No, I mean that's. Yeah, no, that's. I mean that's like, yeah, this is why I'm like, this is why we transitioned to solar sooner, you know, because it's like if it helps at all with these kinds of issues, then it's like, worth, worth the effort, you know, it's going to happen anyway.

Speaker 1:          01:30:59       It's like you may as well just do it now, so I just think that you were doing an Antarctica, you're filming something there as well. Do you do a lot of that now? I'm well for a trip like that for an expedition. I mean that was the north face expedition and so that's where they get a lot of their brand content and so it makes sense to film a trip like that and we were somewhere where the nobody ever goes. We were doing first a sense of peaks, ended up never been climbed so it kind of makes sense to document that to some extent. But in general I think I try to balance my just pure climbing with filming. That's what I was going to ask you. Like you don't want to get, you don't want to film all the timing, everything that's on your head every week.

Speaker 1:          01:31:35       Now that stuff drives me crazy. I'm not into that. But when you're in the most beautiful place, sometimes it makes sense. Well where's something, especially for someone like north face, I mean their whole company is about really exploration. Yeah. Yeah. When, when you are in that sort of situation where you're filming these things, like is it difficult to be, to act normal, to be, to, to be yourself? We're not refuse if you saw free solar, you know, that I only have one mode and that's just, that's just me. Um, which I mean when, when I see the film, a lot of them like, oh, maybe I need to censor myself a little more. Like maybe think there should be a little more thoughtful about what I say, but, but um, no, I mean I'm pretty much always, I just, I just do. Me and the people are filming or not.

Speaker 1:          01:32:21       They just get. I mean, I'm more mindful of profanity and a few things like that. If I know that I'm being filmed right now, I'm being watched. Then I try to be slightly more respectful, especially if I see kids in an audience that definitely try not to curse. But um, but overall I'm like, no, I just, I just always stay in my mind, you know. Well, that's what I was talking about earlier when I was asking the difference between you when you're being your, your love of this is your love of nature and of being in these beautiful national forests and public lands and experiencing these amazing environments. But then sometimes that gets sort of perverted when you filming everything and you've got people just. Everything becomes this sort of presentation and everything becomes professional. And I mean I think that's the risk with filming.

Speaker 1:          01:33:08       I think with Free Solo. I think they did an amazing job of, of maintaining the character, you know, the nuance. Not perverting it in any way. No, I think so too. I think it was amazing. Yeah. I mean, I think, uh, I think they did a really good job of that, like, and it's still, it's still sort of understated, you know, even though it's like this spectacular feat, it's still sort of subdued and its own way. It's just sort of lays it out beautifully. Let's you just sort of judge for yourself and just, well, you know, it's impossible to be anything but spectacular so you don't really have to dress it up. Yeah, yeah, totally. Well that's the beauty of filming anything in Yosemite is that it's just, I mean it's, it's honestly just one of the most beautiful places on earth would be like putting a pretty dress on a Ferrari or like leave it alone.

Speaker 1:          01:33:47       It's done. You've already got it. Have you ever thought about doing some like live journal from the field or some sort of a podcast or something along those lines? Um, no, I mean, should I. yeah, that sounds, that sounds like too much work. A podcast would be easy. I don't know, but you have to be able to interview people proper way. No, you don't. No, you don't think. My friend bill burr has a podcast where he just talks. He does a fucking great, but he's a comedian. Oh yeah, yeah. Okay. With Monday morning podcast, but you just sitting down. I mean you could go off notes, you could go off of and just. I think people would love that if you just never thought about it. I mean in some ways I do have strong opinions about a lot of things, like if I just ranted about environmental issues and similar things that I care about, that actually would be kind of fun, but you'd have a significant impact to especially have such a large platform now. I Dunno, I dunno. I'll consider it. That's the first time that anyone's ever mentioned. I'm sort of like, I could think about that. I'm notorious for trying to talk people into podcast, but I really think in your case you'd be a great idea. I mean, you really feel like. I tell everyone to do it, but you should really do it well. People get mad

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       at me. You keep telling people to do it, but I think you, if you had a portable unit, like a fricking players, something you can just record a phone. Really? Oh yeah. A recording on your phone. It's very easy. Um, you could, I mean we've done a bunch of them were just the voice notes from the phone just talking to the voice notes from the phone and you can make a podcast off that and it's really easy to upload. But just saving. Maybe that's my future. Sitting in your van, you know, afterwards and just talking about things you're working on with your foundation, talking about spectacular moments during climbs where you're, you're seeing things and you know, talking about what it's been like doing this tour for free.

Speaker 3:          01:35:40       Yeah. No, I'm like, I'll, I'll, I'll think about it. I mean that's interesting. I understand where to put it out there. I mean, I think it's a great idea, man. Huh? Huh? You consider to get it out or send me a little MP. Three recorder. We can definitely do that, but we could also help you like pro. I can promote it for you, put it on twitter, let people, we'll see if uh, if I ever actually do anything like that. But um, but no, it's an interesting idea. I mean it's an interesting way to like share, share ideas better. Well,

Speaker 2:          01:36:09       well the reason why I'm saying this just because you have this very specific, very unusual life and you also have all these ideas about the environment and have all these ideas about using it for positive reasons and altruistic, hoping to freaking make the world a better place and having, making an impact with your foundation. I really think it could look the best thing with your foundation would be to make, make it expose to more people and it would most certainly do that.

Speaker 3:          01:36:41       Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to my executive director about that too. I mean that would be an interesting way to at least share the ideas that I care about. Yeah, exactly. The idea of just sitting in a recording, I'm like, oh yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:36:53       Kinda cool. You know, like, like you at the base of a mountain just talking about this and climbing and your personal thoughts in that

Speaker 3:          01:37:02       could be Douchey, but it'd have to be well done. You'd have to be a Douche bag for it to be douchey. Well that's the danger. That's the danger. You just never. I mean, nobody thinks that they're the Douche, you know, you think you'd become a Douche or you just never know. You never know when you're like, I'm just gonna record monologues of me rambling about ideas. That's when you start to trend towards do sheena's perhaps. Well, it's a slippery slope. You could always review it or have your girlfriend review it. Yeah, that's.

Speaker 2:          01:37:28       You don't have to do it live. Just, you know. And then she could say, okay, that part we use rant and rave about diesel might want to.

Speaker 3:          01:37:36       No, I mean why or maybe not. Yeah. No, I feel strongly about. I'll rant and rave about diesel forever. That's just not bros. Yeah man. Imagine when electric trucks, You know, like long haul trucking or mike. Oh well tesla's already on there. On the ball with that. Yeah. We'll hopefully, I kind of don't care who comes market first, that stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       I just want somebody to start selling a lot of them. She was lIke, I just wanted the change to happen quickly. It doesn't matter who does it or how. It's like, it just needs to happen. You've got a very significant voice right now. I really think that you could make a big impact with a lot of people. And the thing about these impacts, it's sorta like the butterfly effect, right? It's like you never know what it actually changes. I agree with how many people are going to hear you just from this podcast and the things you're saying about solar and about and people thinking about like, yeah, maybe, maybe I can do something and then boom, it just makes these little incremental steps and then they carry on momentum and you never know. Well that's the, that's the positive way of looking at it, you know, cool to like notes from wherever you are just.

Speaker 2:          01:38:40       I mean he doesn't, you don't have to have. The beautiful thing is too, it doesn't have to have any kind of structure. You don't have to have any time. You can do one for 15 minutes if you want and people will listen to it. You could do it for an hour, know that that might be a little micro hits like little rambles for sure. Do it as long as you want, and it looked. Like I said, the beautiful thing about things like this is that there's no. There's no real structure to it where you have to do something totally. Totally. You just decide in a lot of ways, that's the nature of climbing to where you never have to do anything. You just find what inspires you. You work towards it, you do it when you're excited about it. I'm totally into that kind of thing because it's actually, that's.

Speaker 2:          01:39:18       I've always cry, contrast to cliMbing from other mainstream sports like that because with climbing, it's like the objective is always there. YOu're always inspired by it. You do it whenever you're ready as opposed to having to perform on the right day at the right time. You know, it's like, I love that lifesTyle where you're like, you know, today is my day, or today's not my day, just like maybe like leading up to you free soloing el cap. If there was sort of a documented audio journal while I watch the film, this is, you're just wetting their appetite. I mean it's a beautiful film. It's fantastic, but there's people like to see more and more stuff. Interesting and it's entirely up to you what you want to share. Don't want to share it. Especially if yOu do it this way. You don't have an executive producer, you don't have directors, you know, totally would.

Speaker 2:          01:40:05       That. I definitely couldn't handle too much. Just you just, you just talking about stuff and your specific vision of the things that you'd like to talk about and your, your specific message because that's one of the things that people really, really enjoy about something like a podcast is that they know there's no one telling you what to say or what to do that, you know, following your heart, sitting in his van, you know, drinking a cup of tea just with the iphone talking. It's hard to imagine people would find that. Understand what I'm telling You. Oh, I'm really surprised. I bet though. Tell him jamie people, Would it be listening to it people to you for sure. Oh no. I appreciate that, but I'm slightly worried I'm going to be. I'm going to miss my plane. Okay. Yeah, we gotta get you outta here. Thank you very much. Thanks for being here. I really appreciate

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       it. Excellent. Yeah, it's fun. It's fun to chat again because I remember last time I was on the show with, it was a full experience for him. It's one of the first time that I'd done anything like that and it was like, It was pretty mega. I was like, whoa, I have no idea what I'm doing. This is so much. And like now I feel so much more comfortable and fun to chat. It was awesome. It was great. It was really great to see what I'm saying. It feels like coming of age to come back and shouted. Yeah, it's really nice. Beautiful. Alright, cool. I appreciate it. Thanks alex. Appreciate it. Yeah, that's what I remember last time.
