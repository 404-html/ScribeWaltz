Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Ah, Josh is ABS. We're live. Hello mate. What's up brother? How you doing? Good. I've been all over the place. You have it all over that, but I'm wondering, don't. I'm not even in a huff post live anymore. I know you're wondering. I'm a wonder here. We, the people now I'm all the way to people. The way I like calling myself unemployed. I think it's just more. I think there's more. It takes more to just say that you're unemployed until you're like, well, I've got a lot of projects going on. I've got a lot of fingers, a lot of pies. And I'm like, I'm freelance now. But aren't you self employed? Yeah. So that's not unemployed. No, but I like fucking with people. Oh, you make them feel sad for you and make them feel because people, people want you to immediately say like that you're doing okay and unemployed makes you sound like a bum.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       So I like starting from the lowest possible position. You should tell people that you're going to get a trailer and a, you're going to travel across the crunch. You get one of those things dragged behind your car is going to live out of it yet, and the national parks, the mall wakes. I don't have a full time job that strong of my accent skin and get pale. I'm just dammit nickname, nickname. Here's my trailer. I haven't had a job in 15 years. You can't go from Australian accent too. Just did it. Americans did it. I just did it on allow that many people say that things are impossible. Joe Rogan, but I'm here to prove them wrong. Isn't it interesting? How long have you moved to a place you're not allowed to adopt the accent? Like if an American moves to England, like remember when Madonna, she was only there for like six months.

Speaker 1:          00:01:18       She started talking like this and everybody's like, bitch, fuck out of here. Like we know that people talk like that and we know it's a style of. It's an affectation. You decided to talk like that. You don't have to talk like that. You could obviously, when you watch British actors play, Americans do a brilliant job of talking in an American accent, like the walking dead people. When people find out that rick is, that he's, he's from England, from England, the girl Maggie, she's from England. Everybody from fucking England. Yeah. And I'm in. A lot of people don't know that those are aussies as well. If they're doing all over the American accents. How often does Russell Crowe and don't have an American accent and imagery and uh, what's his face? Fucking Batman. Christian Bale. He's Australian English. Same Shit. Don't get me started on the differences between New Zealand.

Speaker 1:          00:02:03       Isn't Australians as well? Does this whole thing about who fuck you? This is the same spot, right? Conduct condo. It's about as different as Canada and America. Not really. Not very rarely. Barely close enough. Uh, there's a lot of dispute between the two countries. About which one that has to cut. Mel Gibson. Mel was, I think born in New Zealand and there's some bullshit about whether the reason American Australian or New Zealand you can have him as long as he's not Australian. Everybody loved him for awhile. He was so good. He was awesome. Just couldn't keep it together. No wellbeing, a wildly antisemitic, racist. Um, religious nutjob doesn't help. Do you think he's a crazy person though? I don't know whether, whether that means anything when you're that famous. Of course it does. It always means something. I mean, being that famous doesn't discount certain biological realities of brain function.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       I think people are bad. Livers or livers go bad. People get lung cancer. People without a doubt developed brain diseases. Whether or not it's a psychological disease, meaning is a disease of thought processes and taking you down bad roads. Those bad thought process become ingrained and you continue them over and over again out of habit or whether or not he's obviously an alcoholic, right? So that's a real issue. He, um, he's had some problems like tech, lung cancer for example. Obviously the things that you do to your body going to have a large impact on whether or not you're likely to get lung cancer. Sure. And similarly, I think that living in the rarefied atmosphere of being incredibly, outrageously famous probably put grooves in your mental pathways that predispose you to being odd. Good point. Yeah, definitely. And as you get older, when things start to fall apart, you know, physically and psychologically and maritally and you know, when he was with that crazy lady, I mean that's what that is, is like the ultimate three court.

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       It's not midlife, it's three quarters life like dilemma. Yeah. And how many people do you surround yourself with when you at that level of superstardom who were willing to call bullshit on your bullshit, right? Like I think a healthy famous person. We will know them as people who are able to keep their head screwed on because they still surround themselves with a posse who were like, ah, get outta here. What are you doing with this? You've got a Latin mass still doing the pre reformation Catholic, like liturgies up on a hill in the Hollywood hills and you're talking about how Jews caused all the wars in the world. Get it. What are you doing? This is why people like buddy cop movies. Because in a buddy cop movie, Danny Glover would straighten them back out, he'd be like, come on man, get it together, and then he will pull it together and you stop being crazy what?

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       He's by himself on a fucking mountain and Malibu's screaming at the help yelling at his Russian guy, what's the name of his character? And more open to doing what Mel Gibson's and rigs rigs. So Mel Gibson needs a danny glover. The way that mountain riggs did. Well, he needs Danny Glover, the actual Danny Glover, because if you pay attention to Danny Glover's twitter feed and his social media feed, it's all about like helping people out and charities and spirituality and consideration for the earth. And Danny Glover has got a really interesting. I'll follow him. He's a very open minded, intelligent guy from the few things that I've paid attention to. I think Danny Glover's like paying attention to the world. They should be together for real. I love, I love it when people who you admire, his craft you admire, grow into being something more than that. And like sort of spiritually enlightened.

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       It was like when Garry shandling died, uh, he had become someone who was super interested in really interesting things. I mean, he was, I didn't know. I didn't know much about them. I didn't either until I was following him on twitter when the day that he died I went to his twitter page to see what his last tweets were and I saw that he was following me for some strange reason, which makes me, made me feel like all the more kind of close to him and started going back through all of his old tweets and he's just interested in spirituality, all kinds of shit that you and I are interested in. I didn't know him. I met him like re very briefly, like, hi, nice to meet you at the comedy and Magic Club. Never really got a chance to talk to him, but God, what a funny guy.

Speaker 1:          00:06:09       Larry Sanders show was amazing. I mean two of the most groundbreaking sitcoms, like all of the, all of those sitcoms that now like modern family and everything all have the same. Like, this is a pseudo documentary and these people are, for some reason talking to the camera, it doesn't really make any sense anymore. Like why is this documentary being made about these modern family people? How long has this documentary? Why not always like it's been on for nine years or something? Where's the documentary crew? Why are they talking to the camera dot? It's the whole conceit has broken down, but all of those shows owe they're genesis to garry shandling, to the fact that he did the Larry Sanders show, Larry Sanders show and it's Gary shandling show. He had some great stuff. Really great stuff. So what's this shit about facebook? I just walked in here and uh, and you, you told me that there are these pieces about how facebook workers are admitting that they routinely suppressed conservative news from the facebook newsfeed.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       Yeah, I actually got it from Steven crowder. He sent it to me and then I looked it up and then I saw it was on Gizmodo and I was like, wow, this is crazy. Like this enforcement of a liberal liberal ideas. Former facebook workers says we routinely suppressed conservative news, so, uh, they would keep conservative news from trending and they would, uh, they would inject stories that weren't trending. They would inject them into the trending stories if they match their ideologies. I mean, this is so dangerous and upsetting for me even if you are a complete, like liberal fascist and, and you don't believe in freedom of speech or freedom of ideas. But Jamie had a very interesting point was that he was saying, but when you look at the believers, like the Justin Bieber fans, they overwhelmed the trending to the point where twitter became the Justin bieber show and then twitter had to go, okay, all right, settle the fuck down.

Speaker 1:          00:07:54       All these little 16 year old girls are finger banging themselves and slamming their fucking iphones and trying to get this guy, you know, and try to pay attention to this guy constantly. Twenty four hours a day. Those believers are out of their fucking mind. But that doesn't mean. But what did twitter do? Something about that. And Actually de Justin Bieber tweets is that long time ago, like two or three years into twitter starting out. There's 10 trending topics I believe that I remember is like seven out of the 10 were all Justin Bieber. This I love Justin Bieber, whatever it was at the time.

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       I forgot to bring that up with Dan are back from the arcs and the black keys when he was here because he'd got into it with believers like they got into. They got mad at him and done all the people you could just in sheer numbers it's like, it's like taking on a fight with an army of fire ants. You're just not going to win. You know what's interesting? They get mad at you if you are older than them. But if you use twitter, like one of the things that they love to say like you fucking old man. Why are you even on twitter? Like as if my generation invented it. What they're trying to do is they're trying to. They're acknowledging this is a stupid behavior and they would assume that you're old enough that you realize that the stupid behavior and you should be better than that.

Speaker 1:          00:09:09       I'm allowed to be an immature little bit. John Fourteen. What's your excuse? Just that there's something to that. There's something that is a part of what they're saying. Part of the technology and the ridiculousness, the difference between de prioritizing, believer, tweet hashtags and you know, and using your status as the most important social media information company in the world. Unless you're a believer. And then I don't see your point bro. I went on twitter looking for what's important, what people are actually talking about. They're talking about Justin fucking bieber. Did you know you got to facetime to know Jamie told me why. Tell me why do you even know these? Jamie's beyond saying Jaycee's wedding 24 hours a day at any given time. You can tack how's, uh, how's Bey and Jay doing right now? They. Okay. And Jamie let you know what's the latest. Jamie's grinning like the Cheshire cat. He's just like, Yep, that's me. That's what he does. He wears yeezys. But he buys easy's. What's the.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       Where's Justin bieber's face said to Jamie. Right below his eye. Let's say you look at it like a tear or something. What is it in that spot for Jesus to Jesus Tattoo? Please tell me. You shitting me? It's a Jesus tarries small. Let's go with it. It looks like it's a cross, bro. It does look like it looks like a mole. That's as big as it gets. Some of us have a better version of. It's across though, right next to him. Oh No. Gay Together. They're begging me for. You guys are banging each other. You cannot tell the difference between your tattoo and just a facial blemish. You've got the wrong tattoo dude. No, he's got the right to that too. Because you started off like that. See what it is. Is he wants to be like one of those black guys like Birdman who has tattoos all over his face.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       Yeah. She doesn't have that kind of balls. So we're just going to go with a little tiny thing that you eventually get lasered off. Whatever, whatever. Not that big a deal. You know, like who's got a lot of like stitches says his name, the white rappers got ak 47 tattooed on the side of his face. Have you ever seen him know? Oh, he's the best. As far as the worst as far as like if I've asked, you mean the worst person in the world and the best examples of. Oh, he's got more tattoos. Oh Wow. That's beautiful. He's got them on his neck and his forehead now. And what is the coolest thing about it is he's got like basically the joker, a like scars coming out of the sides of his mouth that looked like they've got stitches. Hence his name. Stitches. Yeah. Well even has it on his lips, like above his lips and to the sides and left and right. What is the latest thing that he's got? He's got a star on his face to the AK 47. Well, he's got to start. And where Justin Bieber has his little, his little mold. That's the hotspot. Sent me one of those. That's like the dumb dudes version of a lower back tattoo. It's like a tramp stamp or retards. That's what it is. It's just the visibility

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       of it everywhere. That would. That would freak me out. I got a couple of tattoos, but they're not in places where I'm always going to be seen with them. Not that it matters for Justin Bieber. It's not like he's going to be going to a job interview and having to impress them. That's true, but oh yeah, that's Gucci Mane. Gucci Mane had an ice cream and an ice cream cone tattooed on his face with lightening bolts and it says birth be our our. You know why that is? And he also had some shit written under his eyelids. What does that say? What does it say on his eyelids? Looks like old egg. Looks like a snake. It's ingenious that he's said that he's got borough written on the ice cream because ice cream is cold and when people are called they say so see what he's done there. Good point. He's combined the Woodburn, but the visual iconography of an ice cream by linking these two formally disparate concepts in one beautiful tattoo. How about the student copy them? Got The guy next to him. He'd copy Gucci Mane. That's even stupider. Yeah. He went with [inaudible]. He was like, man, maybe I'll get to my Gucci's runoff at the diner and be like, Yo, gooch, they will stop. You won't fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:13:01       Anyway. The implications of a Justin bieber being deprioritized on twitter, I still contend template. You're going back not as, not as great as the implications of Facebook, uh, hiding conservative news stories from its uses on its news feed. It's very unfortunate that someone did this, but it's very important that the workers told us that they did this. Yes. Because it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be an impartial. I guess aggregator, I mean, what is, what would you call facebook? It's a portal where doe for stories and things that are trending, they've never, they've never claimed that what you see is just the most recent thing that is coming up. Right. I mean all of it is algorithms. So the things that you tend to click on and the things that you tend to look at and the things that you tend to like and the stories that you tend to click through to all go into their gigantic algorithm crunching machine, which I just imagined as being like a big willy wonka machines with steam coming up, pink steam coming out the top and a little munchkin toy trains circling it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:04       You put in all of the data and then out the other end of the Olympus compile your facebook feed and so they're making judgments all the time about what they're going to prioritize, but what they shouldn't be doing is including any kind of their own political preferences and we don't yet know if it's actually true or it just looks like this is one person who is saying this is. Even if you. Even if you don't these kinds of policies in the. You're a liberal. You don't know what impact it's gonna have and whether or not. By putting this stuff out, people are going to get more liberal. Maybe they'll get more frustrated with liberal ideas and they'll become more conservative. It's more likely to be that it fuels the idea that being a liberal is being a person's detached from reality, and that's one of the the the major points of criticism. When, when, when the conservative people go after the liberals, one of the major

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       things that they try to harp on is that liberals are out of touch with reality. When you have something like this and you're reinforcing the idea that there are shielding certain aspects of reality like that. Some people have these conservative opinions and if some people have a conservative opinion and you disagree with that conservative opinion, that's where the open exchange and the marketplace of ideas comes into place. Now, if you don't allow that exchange take place because you deny that people think that way because you hide the stories you're going to alienate. You're going to create these confirmation bias forums. You're going to create these places where people like salon.com, where people just. They agree with each other to the point and then they tell you why. You know, why is Josh Zaps the worst? Will tell you why, and then they tell you. They ask a question like eight points, like eight reasons why justice is the worst.

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       Here's why he's terribly. I'd give you a dozen, but it's. It's not news anymore. There's so hysterically ridiculous is so off the deep end. I mean it used to be the case that we thought of progressives and liberals as being more pro free speech, or at least I did. I use the side of more inclusiveness and more tolerance and it's becoming increasingly not the case at all. That there's more politically correct bullshit and most censorship and more imposing, less tolerance of each of other people's ideas on the lift. Even though they're on the run. I, I 100 percent believed that, but I believe it's the pendulum effect. I think it's the suppression of free speech by the Conservatives and the Bush administration that fuck people up so sideways. They bounce back the other way, ultra hard. I think people got so angry at what was going on with John Ashcroft covering statues up with drapes and oh, I loved that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       All the craziness that was going on in that administration and all the suppression of gay rights as everyone know about that, the fact that John Ashcroft actually had the penis on a statue on an old Roman statue and she was like in one of the great temples down in Washington DC covered up because he was so puritanical. He didn't want a naked penis from an agent statue. He was disturbing that that guy got into office. One of the, one of the guys that uh, I correspond with online. He had something to do with some record store and he sent me an album of Gospel songs that John Ashcroft had made with some other dude. He was fucking and probably still is bat shit crazy. Well, I mean they, they, they kind of, what do you call it, like when you stack like that basically stacked the Bush administration with a lot of crazy people like that. Like the first, especially the first administration of the Bush administration, the 2000 man. You look at some of those paypal, they basically theocrats. I mean, they're not that different from a Christian version of what the Iranian leaders. Ah, well, not only that, there's so caricature that they seem like characters in a movie, like a bad action movie. I mean, you think about what you've got. You've got Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney to people arguably forged in the center of the earth. I mean, they're fucking

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       straight up evil, right? Dick Cheney is straight up evil. He got to a point where he didn't have a fucking heartbeat. No. I mean the guy had an artificial heart put in which was pumping his blood through. Still have no power. You had a transplant it. Oh, does he have a live? Have found some dude and cut his fucking heart out. You Bet your ass they did with one stone knives. We have to have a match your bullshit. You happen to have a met. She knew that they would have killed somebody. Has some secret service agent disappeared. One secret service agent and really healthy diet. Fucking that guy open like a fish. You can just imagine they've probably got like a tinder for, for Dick Cheney, where he's just swiping left and swiping right on the people who they're going to kill for his heart. You got a 23 year old.

Speaker 2:          00:18:33       He did. He and Ashcroft and uh, there was, there was a whole bunch of them Wolfowitz. I mean that guy looked like a demon, you know, think, I mean all of those fucking that the whole administration was filled with chicken hawks that we're all about Jesus and wanting to go over there and kick some ass. Fucking blow shit up. It's interesting you mentioned Wolfowitz because in terms of like what was saying about the left is can be intolerant of other ideas. A lot of these guys, especially Wolfowitz with Forma Marxists when, when Wolfowitz was young at university, he was a revolutionary Marxist. Whoa. And it's interesting that oftentimes people who who are hypo revolutionary socialists can flip into becoming hyper, an Randian idealistic reaction raise. And there's the same kind of like when you, it's, it's not that different when you think about it, like people think of them as being ideas that are at the end of the political spectrum, but it's excellent actually more like a horseshoe, right?

Speaker 2:          00:19:33       Where at one end you think that you can overthrow the capitalist system and create a utopia in which everyone is gonna be be equal and it's going to be from each according to his ability to each according to his need. And then at the other end you believe that you can wipe society is clean, you can go into Iraq and raise everything and then start from fresh and democracy will spring up and people will be able to live in pace. I mean they're both basically kind of mess niantic, Utopian ideas about change instead of the sort of change that I think actually works, which is just incremental grudging change bit by bit. Slowly Eking it out. Yeah. That's not what Chaney and Wolfowitz think the world is all about. No, they tried to force change and force change at home and abroad. And that's where like the conspiracy theories come in about nine slash 11 attacks and Dick Cheney saying that we need something like an a

Speaker 3:          00:20:25       Pearl Harbor and that's where people really freak out because they look at how much people actually did profit from that event. So they go, well, okay, is it possible that someone had a part in letting that event happen or helping that event happened or ignoring the fact that event was gonna happen and allowing it to happen? Or is it a matter of people just capitalizing on an event? Which is what the most logical point of view is that they. There's incompetent, the event happened, and then they capitalized on it. Like any good dictatorship.

Speaker 2:          00:20:54       Yeah, exactly. I mean, I do think when you look at Helen competently, they managed Iraq. When you're looking at and competently they managed Katrina. When you look at how and competently they manage things that they wanted to get right. The idea that they could have pulled off something like that within eight months of entering office. I find implausible like whenever the. If I have to choose between in competence versus a massive conspiracy, I usually think people are just generally incompetent.

Speaker 3:          00:21:18       Then do you even start that conversation? How do you even say, listen here, this out, before you get crazy here, the side, I got an idea. We got to talk some dudes into flying planes into the world. Trade Center towers one and two. We're going to hijack planes, fill with people. We're going to talk these guys into flying them into the, into the buildings. They'd be like, wait, what? What, what, what? What? Who the fuck is going to do that? Religious people, you got to get them to believe that there's a bunch of posts he waiting for them in heaven and all they have to do is fly these planes into buildings to get that pussy.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       Uh, yeah. But see, Joe, these plans had long been hatching as they were. They were camps in Afghanistan, which we will funding. Is that your Alex Jones impression? I can feel it coming on with Alex Jones.

Speaker 3:          00:22:00       No, Alex Jones would be yelling at me right now explaining why I'm wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:22:04       Um, I just. So there's a much easier way to have done it, which is if, if you wanted a pretext to go into Iraq or you'd need to do would be. I was talking to the national defense guy about this. He was like, there was a no fly zone over Iraq. The CIA could have painted a US plane, the Iraqi colors and just faked a shoot down a US or British jet that was patrolling the no fly zone and you would have a clear much clearer case actually in international law to go to war. Then the vague case that they did do, because they didn't. I mean it wasn't connected to nine slash 11, so they have to make up this shit about wmds and all that sort of stuff. You could easily have orchestrated something without bringing down the world trade towers. That would have given you a good reason to go into Iraq.

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       Well that was one of the main reasons why a lot of people bought into. Do you know about operation northwoods? Do you know that story that's only heard you talk about it? Yeah. The operation northwoods, that was that exact plan to get people to go to war with Cuba to get us excited about it. They were going to blow up in American drone. They were going to send a jetliner up in the air with no one in it and shoot it out of the sky. They were gonna arm, Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay. That was the main idea behind it was like this would be the way we could get people excited about going to war with Cuba because you know that whole Bay of pigs and all that fucking disaster that happened when Kennedy was in office. I mean, and then the missile crisis, there was a lot of tension going on with Cuba, so they had concocted this idea. It's called operation northwoods. It was signed by the Joint Chiefs of staff, so they went with it like there were like, sounds like democracy and they let's just fucking lie to people and blow shit up and kill Americans. They were going to fucking kill Americans in Guantanamo Bay. Oh, you've been blaming on the cube.

Speaker 2:          00:23:40       I'm sure they have because they're so because there's such unscrupulous assholes and they do all of they. They do these legitimate conspiracy theories. That's what gives people reasons to believe in the more than what I regard as being that much more ridiculous conspiracy theories, but it would be a lot better if they just didn't do any of this shit in the first place and then people wouldn't be out of their minds being so suspicious about whether or not nine slash 11 was an inside job.

Speaker 3:          00:24:00       Well, there's also, there was the word that Dick Cheney was discussing the possibility of doing something like that for Iran before they left office. They were talking about orchestrating a false flag on a ran before they left office and they never pulled it off. Whether or not it's true or not remains to be seen, but it's not outside the realm of possibility. I mean, it happened in so many different times in history when Nero burned Rome, when Hitler burned the Reichstag. When I mean the whole. What happened to get us into Vietnam?

Speaker 2:          00:24:31       Well that's right. Like the Gulf of Tonkin, Gulf of Tonkin. They tended, we got shot at. That's right, and there's also a little. You don't even have to go as far as like the Nazis, just in terms of what the CIA has done, encounter up counterinsurgency operations in south South America and stuff. The involvement in the coup in 1973 in Chile. I was reading up about that lately because I went to Chile a couple of years ago. I mean it's not that they absolutely completely manufacture total bullshit from whole cloth, but they give voice to conspiracy theories in those particular countries. They fund a media outlets that are, that are spreading. We know what the CIA wants to get hurt and they just basically put their finger on the scales of something so that it goes another way. I mean the democratically elected government in Chile was overthrown by a brutal military dictatorship, which then lasted for an entire generation. Thanks largely to the CIA. I mean we don't even think or hear or learn about that stuff. And do you think that it's possible for them to go, listen, you got to break some eggs to make an omelet. You want America to be America led. The free home of the brave was the only one wig. We got to fucking lie to you.

Speaker 3:          00:25:36       We've got to kick some ass. A lot of shit we'd like to tell you, but the world works and really fucked up way and you don't want to know about that because you want to watch real housewives.

Speaker 2:          00:25:42       Exactly. What we're going to do now, and I, I have, I actually have some sympathy for that idea. I, a friend of a friend of mine was easily former director of the CIA. I spent a Thanksgiving with him once down in Washington DC. Did you look in his basement? Tall skulls, open the doors sculptural out in the hallway. And when I talked to people like that, yeah, I do understand that our vision of the world is a very small sliver and can be quite naive, very naive. Their attitude is when you're actually working in the national security apparatus, their apparatus apparatus, we might've made a word that'll do. I just did it. Just showing you think he made up a word, but it sounds. I like it. If you didn't just stop yourself, then the apparatus would be a new word. A lot of people at home would.

Speaker 2:          00:26:26       It went okay. It seems like a smart guy. If you actually work there, then I think your outlook is basically what you just articulated, which is, um, it, it'll be lovely if we all lived in a world where with ice cream and candy and where the lines slipped with the lambs and the, and the postman hug the dogs and we were all dancing the streets. But listen Honcho, it's a tough world out there and either the Saddam Hussein's and the Putin's are going to roll it away. And sometimes you have to break a few weeks in order to make an Omelette. And sometimes you have to do things that, uh, that might not seem pretty on the surface. But I'll tell you what were the ones who are standing on the wall watching God. So you go about your business and we'll take care of shit. I heard the national anthem playing. You really did. Which won the Australian one.

Speaker 3:          00:27:05       Cool. Who's cruise on?

Speaker 2:          00:27:11       Wait, whatever. It's all the same. Even American. I'm probably Canadian or something. Barely America. Uh, America. The beautiful. Shouldn't be the national anthem. Can I just say that? That's better. Stop bangled banner. Start rockets in it though. I'm going to probably stick with that. The rockets. Red Glare. The bombs bursting in air. What you bombs bursting in air. That's in our fucking national anthem. I love how warmongering so many national anthems. And I like the French. The French one. It literally has the lyrics about the blood of our enemies will fill the canals of France. It's serious shit. That's unrealistic. People you have to call you just. You guys are just lying. There's no happened. Bombs actually could burst in there and do and have doubled the canals fucker. You killing man killer. But you'd have to kill everybody on the planet to fill the canals of blood.

Speaker 2:          00:28:07       It'd be no one left. Well, I mean I killed a lot of Germans in the gym. Is killed a lot of Russians. Have you seen some of the numbers? There's a great graphic that I think like vox produced or something about the number of people in total who were killed in, in the world wars. Each one represented like each thousand dollars million. He's represented by little block. I don't even know what you're talking about, but it's just crazy when you start seeing how many people look at you. Like, Oh, this is a lot who were killed in, for example, Iraq war and it goes back to Vietnam. You know, what will one world war two, the towards the final few years will will to even excluding the Holocaust, just looking at people like mainly Russians, which she asked state just millions upon millions upon millions of people, like 20 million people don't think about. The Russians have died in World War II.

Speaker 2:          00:28:52       There was a lot more of them died than us. And often, I mean if you talk to a military historian, what really ended the war? Yes, Dj was important. But, but the Soviets won the war, I mean it was, it was the fact that the Nazis were just hemorrhaging in the east. That meant that they couldn't put up any defenses in the, in the West. So Dj was a, you know, not to insult the are great forefathers who fought there, but data was a little bit of a walk in the park in comparison to what was happening on the eastern front.

Speaker 3:          00:29:18       Well, there was a lot going on all across the world, but one of the scariest things about France and what happened to them during World War II is the amount of France to this day that you literally can't even visit because it's so filled with waste from all the bombs that were dropped. You seen as an area larger than Paris that's completely fenced in and can't go in it because it's got so much munitions and so many bombs that were dropped there. It's so fucked up. That will be that way for something like 100,000 years or something crazy. I mean, it's poison gas

Speaker 2:          00:29:54       bodies. They're just still buddies, just bones and shit. There's this little town in northern France called villas retina where the aussies were, I mean, you know, no one ever thinks about the [inaudible] and then using this little countries who were fighting there as well, but of course they had their own little little plots that they had to had to fight and there was this big heroic stand against the Germans, which the aussies were in charge of it villas retina and still to this day in the little in the schools and the elementary schools there, they sing the Australian national anthem. They have little Australian flags flying and stuff because they have failed to just littered with the bodies of Australians in northern France from the world war. Wow. That's crazy. Naughty. What will we do it than to make any sense of the side of the world should have just stayed home?

Speaker 3:          00:30:35       Well, I think we saw some of those Hitler speeches. One went, oh, we're going to have to do something. Here is this guy, this Guy Mike. He might have the right stuff to fucking become the real darth vader. Yeah. That's, uh, that, that charismatic person who's completely insane that wants to conquer the world and gets a whole nation behind them is so Donald Trump, I mean, it's so crazy and scary will where he's not trying to take over the world, but it shows you how problematic personality can be when it comes to someone being chosen to be the leader, especially to this day and in this day rather were so soft this day of food coming on these little styrofoam trays and being able to pull up to Wendy's and get a fucking cheeseburger and 15 seconds. We're so weak and it's so easy to exist that we're excited about this guy possibly like overturned the apple cart where people are

Speaker 2:          00:31:32       who don't have any people, don't have any other options as well. I feel like Bernie and trump with a, with a ways in different ways that people had the people who've been on it for a long time. White working class dudes mostly have to like. I mean when you look at the effect that middle incomes of middle American has been stagnating for the past 30 years. Manufacturing has been in decline like they haven't been. There hasn't been a rise in working class incomes in America since the eighties.

Speaker 3:          00:32:01       I was surprised that Elizabeth Warren didn't get more traction. It seems like once that native American stuff came out about her, she just went, Oh Kim, just kind of stuff. They think she believes that she is more useful in the Senate maybe, but you know, the native American stuff where she faked a native American heritage in order to get some sort of a scholarship.

Speaker 2:          00:32:20       When I hear things like that, I use my brain. It just hits the. This is probably a btob part of my brain and it just goes straight out my ear because I don't. I don't really give a shit about that.

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       Stuff like that. You don't care about someone faking their ethnicity. Why didn't I didn't look into it enough. Me I

Speaker 2:          00:32:35       needed to. She's a brilliant woman. What? Why? Why was she doing it? Well, wanted to get into a university. She have to go

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       pull that up. Jamie. Find out what the fuck that was all about, but I don't know. I mean, who knows if she actually did it, maybe someone else did it and she sort of went with it. So difficult to talking to her. If it's a Rachel dolezal thing with someone who spent their whole life pretending to be something that they're not, then I think yes, that there's a quite a few of those out there though. Then I, I do think that that's disqualifying, but I feel like if the only thing that you'll political opponents can dig up on you is that you filled out a form wrong, but that's not filling out a form wrong. That's being deceptive about your ethnicity in order to take advantage of like people that are undermined by society. I mean, when you go with your ranking, let's kill her to put her into trump's concentration.

Speaker 1:          00:33:25       We don't have any. Uh, yeah. Trump isn't, is fascinating, isn't it? I can't believe it's actually going to happen. He might, when he, he's real close to winning because I just don't know whether or not Hillary can hold up to scrutiny when you're talking about her being under to criminal investigations and the right now. Right now, the immediate future, this to criminal investigations going on, they just gave immunity to the guy who set up that email server. They deported him. They brought him over to America. Extra added them wanting to do. What's that called? They brought them over to America and gave him immunity. So what the fuck man? What, what is gonna Happen Now? Well, yeah, we are one. Uh, I was talking to a guy hacked it rather immunity. Yeah. Um, I was talking to body laying on the, on my podcast about them.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       And that's not true. Hold on a second. They give immunity to go set up the server. The extradited. The guy who created the hack that he doesn't have immunity. Where do you think I hacked? I think he's from Romania. The coolest, coolest. He's from Romania. The Guy who hacked into the serve, the email servers and exposed all that. I want to say he's from a very small rural town in Romania. I'm not kidding. Even if that's not true, I liked that picture. I like that image of him just in a shed, in a bond in the middle of nowhere. And icy cold remaining true though. Romania. Lucifer? I breached Clinton server. It was easy. Yeah. So this guy, he got arrested and he's in jail, but the guy was set up the actual server itself, by the way, which is in her bathroom. Okay. What? Why would you put a server in your bathroom?

Speaker 1:          00:34:55       Exactly. Okay. Who knows? But that guy got immunity in this guy got so frustratingly paranoid. Even if there was nothing, even if she wasn't doing anything wrong, the fact that she's so paranoid as to need to set that up because she's so terrified that someone's going to get access to our emails. Well, you know, they spent a million dollars to fight off social media opinions. Do you know about this? Look at this. The Pax correct commenters on Reddit and facebook. A million dollars to spend a million dollars to fight off people that don't like Clinton. I mean they're what they're doing as a trend of engineer public support, public support that Bernie sanders has got organically. Yeah, that'd be. Trump has organically too. Maybe we don't

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       know. Well, here's the thing. What he does, what he does have is even people who hate him, acknowledged that he is not full of bullshit and that he's not being. He's not spending someone else's lines. He doesn't seem manufactured. He's obviously not 100 conventional politician. I can dislike all of his policies as much as I do, but I can still regard him as being a breath of fresh air. Hold on. You don't like his policies. What about the wall? The Wall's great idea. Are you a big pink floyd fan? I am a pink floyd fan. Actually. I don't think the wall is the craziest of is even close to his craziest of ideas. I mean the craziest. Keeping Muslims out of the country and probably not allowing any noncitizen Muslims into the United States. This is not only crazy but incredibly dangerous because I think that if we want to be able to conquer a Islam, Islam and jihadism, Islamic terrorism, we've got to find a way of.

Speaker 2:          00:36:29       I mean our best resources and moderate Muslims inside the United States, right? Who can, who have their ear to the ground, who will notice mosques that might be becoming radicalized. You want to appear to be a friendly, tolerant democracy and of course you want to put in place all the security precautions that unnecessarily and you don't want to just be allowing millions of, of unscreened people to come pouring in the way that they have in Europe. But we don't have that problem here because we've got ocean between us so we can pick and choose who was also why it gets really weird when you start talking about the CIA and the CIA infiltrating different organizations. It's like that's where you kind of support it. Kinda support clan to Stein behavior and sneakiness and deception because they're, they're pretty good at it. They've been doing it for a long time and they know how to get deep into organizations.

Speaker 2:          00:37:17       You know, like you ever see the show homeland. Yeah. Come on Bro. Yeah, I made a documentary. No. Uh, I mean the idea of a wall to me, but I come from a country Australia which is surrounded. It's an island. So like of course there are not that like the idea of people just pouring across the border back and forth and coming in for seasonal seasonal work and like that to me does strike me as as odd. Yeah. There's a. there's an undefended border. I don't, I don't think it would be a good investment of money. I think it's silly. I think it's a distraction. If you talk to technology experts, they say that there are much better ways of securing the border than with a physical wall. You can have drones and things and you can have all kinds of crazy shit, but because people will dig under a wall of the climate over, well it's not, it's not.

Speaker 2:          00:38:04       It's not nearly as sophisticated as the kind of technology that you could use, but I don't think there's anything inherently like bigoted about it. I think deporting every single person who's here illegally is an overreaction and that like, have you seen the stats about how many seven? 40 seven is full of people. You would need to get all of all 11 million undocumented people in America. There's more than 11 million in la by the way, this idea that there's 11 million undocumented people in America, it's fucking hilarious. Four, oh, five at three the afternoon and look around because there's fucking millions and millions of people that are broken that are from Canada, millions of people from Mexico, millions of people from all sorts of spots that aren't supposed to be here. That God visas and stayed. That shit is rampant. I know the bloody ozzy. He's not to mention Monica, if you guys don't let anybody in Australia either, like boatloads of people that try to get come in legally, that's spinning around, light them on fire and push them out to the ocean and people don't fucking play over there.

Speaker 2:          00:39:06       Australia Australia's policy has been since the eighties that uh, you have a heart, a very high level of legal migration in a high level of refugees. Refugee intake, like on a per capita basis. Australia is one of certainly the top 10 most generous countries in terms of people coming in and more than half of the population of Australia has arrived since the Second World War. Really? Yup. So it's actually a higher immigrant proportion country than the United States, even if you do it legally, if you do it legally, but we have this quite controversial and pretty inhumane, but I suppose defensible policy, which is if you pay a people smuggler to make your way all the way from Afghanistan or Iran or wherever it is, you're coming from Syria and you pass through a bazillion other different countries through Malaysia, through Singapore, you make your way down to Indonesia and you're rich enough to get on a boat.

Speaker 2:          00:39:53       Then comes to Australia. You will never be settled in Australia. Really? You ever, ever, ever, never accepted, and you'll be sent to a one of a couple of Pacific island nations. There's a place called Manus island in Papua New Guinea, I believe. There's another place called Naru, which is a country in its own right, and they have set up these big detention centers there and people can end up there for years or even decades while their cases get heard. It's really barbaric people, so they're fucking lips together in protest. One guy just set himself on fire in front of United Nations inspectors who were there. It's really not pretty stuff, but the government says, listen, we used to have under the law, under the previous government which relaxed these policies. 50,000 people died at sea trying to get to Australia in boats, including women and children. Now almost nobody tries to come to Australia by boat anymore because they know they're never going to settle, so what do you prefer?

Speaker 2:          00:40:39       A few hundred people basically being stuck in indefinite detention on some shitty Pacific island or 50,000 people dying at sea trying to get here because they think they're going to be resettled. Plus Australia remains awesome. That's where it gets weird. It's pretty fucking bad ass there. So if you're trying to like look at the end result might go, man, the result might justify the means because like go to Melbourne. It's fucking beautiful. It's great. It's incredible. Yeah. It's like paradise. There's this thing about Australia that to me it's like, Ooh, they might have it nailed. There's only 20 million people in the entire country. It's a fucking huge country. The landscape is gorgeous. You don't have any ozone layer though. No, that's the problem. You Get Sun burnt and you get cancer into. Yeah. Know Australia has 23 million people, so what's that? About half the population of California.

Speaker 2:          00:41:28       California is about $40. That's La. Yeah. So the greater the greater la area if you, if you include all the way up through and. Yeah. Yeah. And down to down to long beach and all that. Uh, and that's in, that's in an area the same size as the contiguous United States. Crazy. And everybody lives in the edge. Yeah, the middle one. The middle of crocodiles and Lizard. Kangaroos and nuts, man. It's crazy place. Yeah. But Canada is kind of like that. Canada's only got 35 million people and it's bigger than the United States even including Alaska, but it's fucking frozen my good time yet it's the site of Canada and Australia. Kind of very similar in that they're enormous, but totally in hospitable. I mean, you could know sooner live in most parts of Canada, then you could live in most parts of Australia where there's just no water and no vegetation in Australia was desert Canada is ice, not really icy.

Speaker 2:          00:42:17       Probably be better off trying Australia then you would see I'm going to try and Canada. Then you would Australia definitely. Well you could, you could get water, you could make fires and stuff pulling. If there's no water you're screwed. Right. But there's a lot of people that live like. I have some friends that live in Alberta. They live way up there. They live in. It's fucking cold shit. The wintertime up, there's like 30, 40, below zero. I mean he's crazy, but they live there. They're fine with modern civilization I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing, the best writer in Kennedy is, as you say, we all huddle along a very, very narrow strip in Australia. It's the coast and in Canada it's the border.

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       Don't you think it's easier though to live in a cold climate then in hospitably hot climate? Because you could dress for a cold climate who can get in your car, you drive around you all right? You get in your house. It's warm, but hot climates are fucking scary. Like it gets too hot to survive outside for whatever reason. That's waste, Gary, because you can't dress for it. Like you could wear like really insulated close and you can actually stand outside at 10 below. But you grew up in the northeast. Right? But if you're outside and it's 130 degrees outside, you're fuck.

Speaker 2:          00:43:23       I feel like this is just. This just comes from what you're used to. I reckon because you grew up in the northeast, you're not as scared of the call. I've, I, I find like when I first moved to New York, I remember saying to people back in Australia, why is there even a city here? Why? Why did anyone ever come across the ocean and build a fucking city here where it's literally so cold that a dog's piss on the sidewalk will turn into ice. It's like, um, it's like I'm in the TV show the dome and it's just a giant freezer. Because I'd never had the conception of actually being sub freezing like shit is just freezing. You should not be living anywhere where if you fell over drunk at night and hit your head, you would be dead by the morning. But then again we get rid of some dummies.

Speaker 3:          00:44:09       Should we send her a little bit? You know if you're falling asleep out in the street drunk. I mean it's sad when that happens to people. You hear about it with like college kids, they freeze to death. That happens like every other year. So some college kid in New Hampshire will get drunk, fall asleep outside and freeze to death.

Speaker 2:          00:44:24       Shouldn't be living there. Don't do it. Move all of Canada and the North East down to the mid Atlantic states and be done with. It's not though. If you have warm

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       clothes, if you have warm clothes you could survive up there. It's not that bad. Well, I mean if you have air conditioning, you can even live in Phoenix. But sub, no, but sub zero temperatures, like if it's zero outside, you can walk around, you can go places like if it's 130 degrees outside, you can't go anywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:44:47       That's true. You can only go places when it's subfreezing. I have been swimming, my sister in law is finish and in Finland they go in the Saunas and then they'd go out and swim in lakes in the middle of nowhere when it is minus 22 degrees. I've been swimming in a lake when it's minus 22 degrees, the whole thing is frozen over God. They just chip a hole in it. Yeah. Then I didn't need to chip it. They uh, they have a whole like add water spouts so the water keeps moving. So uh, and uh, I made, maybe they stopped by chipping it, but it's basically like a bubbling cold pool. And you sit in the sauna, which is, you know, it's, it's nudging 100 degrees Celsius. I don't know what that is. 200, 200 degrees Fahrenheit or something. And then you come out through the air, which is minus 20 Fahrenheit, I think it crosses Fahrenheit and Celsius crossover around it in the low minus twenties. And then you get in the water, you can't put your head under [inaudible]. You can go into this condition where you, your brain essentially shuts down and goes into phrase. But uh, yeah, there, the people in Finland, they love it so that it looks like they cut a hole in the ice. Yeah. That looks like they got a hole in layoffs. But that's not me. If you got to my facebook and probably find it back there somewhere in the deep, dark and distant. Pam. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:00       Yeah. Well people loved that. That ice cold ice cold going back and forth between the two of them is amazing. It gives you a high. The does well, it actually really does actually produces certain chemicals in your brain. Epinephrin. So what is norepinephrine? Norepinephrine? I'll believe you. I'm Dr Rhonda. Patrick was on. She was talking about, um, cold shock therapy, cold shock proteins and heat shock proteins and that there's a different, um, there's different proteins that we produce in the sauna and the sauna is really beneficial for hormone production, for sleep, Melatonin production, all sorts of different things. Things Melatonin might not have been, but all sorts of growth hormone for sure. That was one of them. But things that rejuvenate the body produced by these heat shock protein.

Speaker 2:          00:46:44       I mean, just look at the nordic, paypal and paypal in northern Germany. They will swear by soreness I mean the Swedes and the Norwegians and the Finns and the Danes. I mean, it's not like these are not people who you'd want to emulate. These

Speaker 3:          00:46:56       are very attractive, healthy, long living people. Yeah, they're robust yet, but I think there's definitely something to it, to both sauna and cold baths. Like you know, when Hoff know Wim Hof, Wim Hoff method of breathing and he's got something like 26 world records. She's been on the podcast for 2:26 world records, but like dealing with climate and cold, he summited everest in his shorts with ice sandals on. I'm not even kidding. No, no oxygen. Didn't bring any oxygen with them is a maniac. Crazy. But he's developed ability to

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       tolerate extreme temperature distance or a temperature changes and he swears by it. He thinks it's a great teacher about life and who you are and what you are and just invigorates you in some strange way that. I mean, when you meet the guy, you believe it because he's like radiating energy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:47       It's funny what people. I mean it's like Tim, Tim Ferris as well, right? Where he, he, he'll go through periods where he's taken my spots and doing all this crazy shit and measuring the impact that it has on his physiology. And I'm just too lazy, man. I think. Wow. I can't talk to you anymore. I'm sorry. Sorry. Yeah, I understand man. Did you say the, um, just say the Philadelphia conference that I, that I sent you, which was about, uh, about what people's guilt. I'm guilty. I'm guilty. What did I do? It was a, it was white. There was a white privileged conference.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       Oh, that's right. I love that article at that because we did this. I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah, you did.

Speaker 2:          00:48:25       I was like, why is my twitter blowing up? Oh, Joe retweeted me. So there was this white privileged conference, which was a kind of politically correct talk fast. Right. And it basically ended up consuming itself entirely because the people who were attending it decided that the conference itself had become too white. So they were getting, they were all there. So they had this Hashtag. I'm white privileged conference, so white WPC, so white. Uh, and it started after one of the speakers there who was a white historian, uh, went overtime and won an Asian American, attend a, a woman tweeted out great keynote, but going over time allotted is another example of white supremacy,

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       Hashtag white privilege conference so wise. And he also made the mistake of using the

Speaker 2:          00:49:14       inward in his speech. I mean he obviously was using it in a historical context because he was talking about race in America. But once that happened, I mean, what could possibly go wrong using the inward at a conference about white guilt, right? Then everyone starts tweeting

Speaker 1:          00:49:28       would never acceptable from Hashtag white folks lips deeply offensive and traumatizing. Hashtag white privilege conference. So white. And that was from a white Tweeta. So then it's like a snake eating its fucking title. Right? All these white people just accusing one another of being too white. You're all whites. We get it. We get it. It's would Michael Shermer calls virtue signaling, right? Yeah. Right. That's there. They're letting the perfect term there. They're trying to find someone who's made some sort of an error. They're attacking them with full force. Yep. And it's also like they're ignoring context on purpose. It's like by saying that the word is, it's never acceptable to say the n word. By saying that and putting that in a tweet, that's not true. It's just not true. Like if there is a reason to say it, if you were explaining something that happened, what someone said, how they said it, you are allowed to repeat word.

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       The idea that you're not allowed to repeat the word around grown adults is to pretend that word is magic to where that going to conjure demon, but it also empowers the word I, in fact, I feel stupid for even having used the phrase the anyway because ordinarily I'd just say, Nigga, if I'm talking about the existence of that would shock the podcast on Australian so I don't understand context. Right? But I mean, I was talking about this on my podcast about. I do think that we, we've gotten away from like where is the other person's heart and what is their intention? So like if you ever use that word in anger, add another person. I think your total count and you should not do that or you're running a nigger.

Speaker 1:          00:51:06       That's true. Mean that gentleman, I couldn't help it as a stand up comedian in me, but uh, but, but if you're just using it in conversation in order to talk about the existence of the wood, we know that though everyone knows that. And I think it's a tough thing. Here's the problem with a lot of these, these things where you attack someone's use of a word, it's Duh. It becomes one of those things like if someone says sexism is bad, racism is system is bad, we need to be a more integrated and complete and whole culture and society and we need to look at each other for like Martin Luther King said, the content of their character, not the color of their skin. Isn't that Dha at a certain point in time, some people think that it's not dark enough in enough places with enough people, but we're going to educate racists or we just gonna toot our own horn as to how non racist we are.

Speaker 1:          00:51:52       Right? The latter. Because another one of the tweets that happened at this conference. What red? A white woman telling a black woman to close the door at a workshop session. Another example of Hashtag white privileged conference. So what? You're not allowed to tell a person of color to do anything. No charges eps. That's right. Even gentle little flowers to just leave the water running. Just whatever you're allowed to say, hey, can you shut that water off? No, that's racist. Oh, okay. Um, what if they just throw lit cigarettes on the ground outside? Are you allowed to correct them or. No? That's racist. Racist. Okay. What if, um, let's just spend the whole rest of the Puc house going through hypothetical anecdotes about what would be, what would very strange that there is a word that certain people are allowed to use. Like the black people can use it and they can even use it as a form of empowerment, but I think that's okay, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:52:47       Do you think that's hypocritical? I reckon if you, I reckon if you will, people in your ancestors have been fucked over completely full hundred years, then it's a little bit rich when the, when the people who belong to the ethnicity that's been fucking you over, don't let you reclaim the wood that was previously oppressive. Oh, 100 percent. Not only that, it in practice it seems correct when it's being done. Yeah. Like if a white person uses the word and they use it for me, even me just using it in that joke, just joking around and what have you done? Yeah. It, you know, it's a joke and it still impacts and some sort of a very bizarre way. But if a rapper is using it, it seems like, like, like someone saying, you know, like, you know what I'm saying man, you know, you know, it's become that.

Speaker 1:          00:53:33       But it was subversive when black people started saying. Right, right, right. But my point being a white person saying the exact same things as horrific and shocking that stitches guy, stitches guy likes that word. He throws the word around all the time. I'll bet he does. Doesn't surprise me at all. Yeah, no nuts on him. That's not him. Stitches to run with the joker. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You gotta get your white people straight out of the birds. The Black Guy, that's Gucci Mane. He uses it to assist. I just mistook a white person for black fests are amazing. I don't even see color president too bad. You were born and some other shit hole and you were born here. You could have a fucking real good run at it. I'm just not good enough. I can't do that. Can't do what trump does. I look at that admiringly.

Speaker 1:          00:54:13       I'm like, how does he have the Bulls? The audacity, which you wouldn't do it that way. No. One of the things that I think is fascinating about trump and really problematic is that human beings love to be united in tribes and not necessarily always good tribes. We love to be united in tribes and whether it's tribes of people who use Mac over windows, whether it's tribes of android users or it's tribes of people from Wisconsin versus tribes from people from Texas. We love to be in a fucking collective group of people, even if it's not a good group, even if it's not good ideas, and one of the things that I get disturbed about what this trump thing is, how many annoying goofy white dudes are really into him. There's like there's an anti intellectual aspect that got shut down, debate aspect about this. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:07       I think there's a lot of that being sarcastic because it goes cultural Australian to trump's support. Not all of us. It's not a, there's intelligent people that support them to totally but then not supporting him because he, his ideas are intelligent. They're supporting him in spite of the fact that they're intelligent because there's something about his vibe that appeals. I feel like there's a bunch of people supporting him cause he's winning and they want to see him win and they want to get in on some of that winning and there's a bunch of dumb white dudes that are hopping aboard that, that are just letting you know who's winning. He's winning, winning. I think it's partly that. I think it's partly exhaustion with the political correctness that we've just been talking about. I just think that they feel like they can't say anything about the threat of Islamist terrorism or about the changing demographics of America or illegal immigration without being branded as a bigot.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       And I think it's also just what I was saying before about him seeming refreshing. Like it's the same back in Australia. I was back in Australia, uh, about six weeks ago and I was on a panel there and they were asking me about trump, like the audience asks questions and stuff and I was trying to explain it by reference to the fact that even in Australia, people don't feel like politicians are speaking their language, like actual human beings and are like, take for example, gay marriage in Australia. Australia still doesn't have gay marriage. You should be psyched about that. You don't have to give away half your money. Sorry honey. Can't do it. I'd love to marry you. Shit ain't happening. I'd be fucking pumped. Tax Laws are different though. It's actually better to be married in Australia than it is not to be married. It's not like here where they screw you. How's that? Not An understanding that someone's going to take care of your shit. No, it's not good. If you get divorced, they're going to take off. You don't want. That's what I'm saying. Fuck taxes. Don't worry about that.

Speaker 2:          00:56:49       So, uh, the, the Australia is one of the most pro gay marriage places in the world when you actually poll people 70 slash 80 percent of the population wants gay marriage. Uh, it's one of the least religious countries in the world when you poll people and more than 60 percent of the population don't believe in God or go to church regularly. The last prime minister, the prime minister before last was an unmarried atheist woman. So it's not like this is a place where you would expect people to be opposed to gay marriage.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       I bet what's going on? I Bet I get it. I bet gay dudes are secretly going and voting against gay marriage so they don't have to get married. That's it. I think that's what it is. I think it's like these pot dealers up in northern California that secretly voted against marijuana legalization because he wanted to keep it illegal so they can make more money and they wouldn't have to turn in the taxes. That's shrewd. It's dirty, it's dirty and it's prevalent. I talked to some growers that were telling me they were going to vote against it, that we're going to vote against legalization because legalization would fuck them over economically, and I know I'm being selfish, but hey man, it's so we do it up here.

Speaker 2:          00:57:47       I mean, do you think the Mexican drug cartels one end to the war on drugs Helena course them. It's good. Why would you? Why would you? But my point is simply that the prime minister of Australia currently favors gay marriage. The palate, there's a majority in parliament for it and instead because he had to do some shady backroom deal to get into power with his fellow party hacks, there's gonna. They're not doing it now. There's going to be like a plebiscite, which is like a nonbinding referendum about it or something and all my only point was it's so obvious that politicians are so full of shit and that they are beholden to people other than the people who elected them. That whether, whether you're listening to Ted Cruz or Hillary Clinton, people just have a sense that they're being fed lines. Did you hear Hillary talking about after trump, huge group playing the Women's card? She goes, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:58:36       fat playing the Woman's Card, Dubbo, lame and weak while pay and

Speaker 2:          00:58:44       what? Nobody speaks like that. Why are you speaking like that? Why you sound like like that so I can understand. I can imagine people going, we'll get lists. It's

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       so gross hearing that it's so gross. First of all, she was a person who said that marriage should be between a man and a woman until 2013. Okay. Two thousand and 13. She was still saying that that is just retarded. Isn't it? Convenient how her views on everything just happened to evolve at exactly the same point so that when they win, 51 percent of the American population comes around to them. She has an awakening. It's just so mysterious that I had. I just don't understand, and this is a key clue me in this who is trying to keep gay marriage illegal in Australia because if there's all those people, you would think that if the majority of the people wanted it, if the prime minister wanted, have all these people wanted it, why? Who is, who's working in, what benefit is there of keeping it illegal?

Speaker 2:          00:59:38       So think about, I think everyone knows it's going to happen. It's just a matter of trying to postpone it, but it's what's basically happened is that there is a rift between within the Conservative Party between conservative conservatives and progressive and like socially liberal conservatives. I think about the Republican Party here where you've got like Christian evangelicals as a component of it, but you've also got the rand poll slash maybe Donald Trump kind of contingent people who aren't, who don't want it, don't really care what people do in the privacy of their own homes, but they're fiscally conservative. Uh, those people. That faction had previously nominated a leader to be the prime minister and that was the prime minister. He got stabbed in the back by one of his colleagues who's socially liberal and the only way that he could get the support of the faction that he needed to become prime minister was by guaranteeing them that he wouldn't move too fast on gay marriage. So it's a minority of a minority, of concern of like culturally conservative conservatives who represent rural districts with a bunch of farmers in them.

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       Uh, the farmers, you know, it's always the God damn farmers. I had a joke, one of my old specials, there's only two types of people that care about gay marriage. People were really dumb, or people that are secretly worried that dicks are delicious. Think that makes sense. That's right. Fucking farmers. Someone's got to get them to suck a dick. And he exactly could realize what's the, all the Hoopla about what about just go ahead and suck it. You probably wouldn't even like it. And then you'd be like, yeah, this guy, I don't give a fuck. What about the guy who was sucking all those whole sticks and um, and a claw is that Seattle was, he was dressed up

Speaker 2:          01:01:19       and like leather and he'd go out in the farm in the middle of the night and he'd like give.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       Oh, you're talking about the guy who got arrested several times talking about the guy who died. He died from getting fired, but his name was. They used to call him Mr Hands. I love that you know his name. Yeah. There was a documentary called zoo and it was all about zoophilia, which is a real sexual attraction that people have to farm animals. Always white people by the way. Hollow white people. Yeah. Actually, I think the guy who got arrested was black, I think just covered in leather, black leather bro. He's from Australia. It's also kind of adding insult to injury for the animal that you're actually wearing. Leather. You, I'm wearing your hat. I'm wearing your skin at the same time as I. Fuck you. He's not wearing a horse here. Maybe not. Yeah, it's different. It's different species, but I'm this guy who lived in Itam claw. They had found each other online on a him in divorce, him and all these people, they develop this relationship

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       online with these people that were really into horses and getting fucked by farm animals and so they invested in this property and they got this farm and they had these horses. There was over a hundred hours of footage of these people getting fucked by animals and one guy, they type it. Oh, there's a video of it. You can watch it. You want to see.

Speaker 2:          01:02:40       Absolutely. What else am I doing this afternoon and folks who are listening only I urge you to go to youtube just to watch the subtle twist of his head. Absolutely. I'm going to wake in Los Angeles. I got a lot of time on my hands between meetings. There'll be. Do you want to win the lottery? Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       Abandoned and famous enough. Claw horse sex faces, new charges in Tennessee. Um, was a different guy. What year is this? Two thousand nine. It's after I'm. That guy was dead. It says. Okay. Here it is. A former Washington state man who was convicted of trespassing at an Itam cloth farm where a man was fatally injured while having sex with a horse in 2005. Right. Is accused of having sex with animals on a Tennessee farm. So one of the same people that was in that group,

Speaker 2:          01:03:29       the guy. What did they grow out of it? Of course. I mean, the way you're hardwired is the way you're hardwired. It's like, I don't know about all that. I would think the ones that my friend got fucked to death. I might want to reconsider it. So yeah, you would think that sensible, but it's. I mean the thing is like being gay or something. I always get in trouble because when we talk about pedophilia and stuff like that, I sort of make the same analogy, which is I have. I mean whilst it's the worst conceivable thing that I can imagine anyone doing morally, I have some sympathy for people who are hard wired in such a way that they get a hard on from infants or animals or something. Right? I mean, the reason I'm not a pedophile is not because I'm morally superior is because I've never been attracted to a, to anyone who's not post pubescent, most likely you're right. Most likely you're right.

Speaker 3:          01:04:10       The real problem becomes in trying to decipher what is causing some person to have these feelings. Like is it an instance of them being molested themselves and they were younger. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:04:22       Which is Mary. It's disproportionately. Yeah. Is it just an error in the way the brain works was that

Speaker 3:          01:04:31       some people have epilepsy. Yeah, but this is very different. This is like clear victimization. Gayness is to people choosing to be attracted to the same sex or being attracted the same sex and choosing to be with each other rather.

Speaker 2:          01:04:40       Yeah. This is different. I'm just talking about what, what, uh, what you're attracted to. Right. If you separate the actual act, obviously, obviously it's very, very different because you're abusing someone who ha, who doesn't, who isn't old enough to be able to consent. Uh, but the act of feeling like you're attracted a radically to a baby, right? Regardless of whether you act on it, that is something that's subjectively must just be a horrible prison. I mean, imagine if you could never get your rocks off without torturing and other person wouldn't be a pretty place to be. It would be horrific. Just wonder, you know, I, I would

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       like to agree with you, but when I think about it, I wonder what is the actual process that leads someone who's. I mean, what is going on in their mind? I can't grasp it. I can't understand it, so may I just got to be multifactorial, right? It's got a bunch of shit. It's probably childhood abuse. It's probably a combination of who knows, but that doesn't change the fact that they're presumably not capable of, of, of changing it. I don't know if that's the case, but it seems to be true. The recidivism rate amongst people who molest children is insanely high. Absolutely. Give them the option of chemical castration as much additive to jail and then just have them with low libido goes. The problem becomes whether or not it's actually sexual or whether it's psychological and if it's uniform, like some people might be sexually attracted to children in some way that you could cure with chemical castration, whereas some of them might be psychologically attracted to the dominance and to like what they say about rape, right?

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       That rape isn't really about sex and a lot of the cases, obviously in some cases it's about sex, but in some cases it's not. It's about power and dominance and how many people. It's not a sexual thing. What if they wound up because they couldn't get it up. They wound up just doing things to kids in a fucked up way because they wanted to control them and dominate them. Well then they're just being dicks, but I mean it might be the origin of it all. I mean there, there might be a bunch of different versions of this and that's for them. That might be the origin of it at all. They might be just they want to torture people. Yep. I mean there's associate pass out there, the psychopaths. There's people that are just fucked. Their brain is fucked. When you hear about a serial killer, I mean, is there a chemical castration for a serial killer to stop them from enjoying killing people?

Speaker 1:          01:06:59       No, but I've spoken to experts about pedophilia who say like, what you want to do, we're making a mistake at the moment by demonizing the condition rather than demonizing the act. Right, so what do you want to do is set up a scenario in which it's possible for a 15 year old kid who realizes that he's attracted to infants to go to a psychiatrist and get help and talk about his options without feeling like he is a total monster just because he's having those feelings. It's hard for us to think that way because if he acted on those feelings, he would be a monster, but you want to find. You want him to be able to avail himself of whatever kind of medical treatment is available rather than just going out and hiding in the shadows and doing and committing monstrous acts. I don't know how to get around that.

Speaker 1:          01:07:44       I don't need. I don't think anybody does. I mean think, think, think. It's one of the reasons why this is such a compelling subject is because it's one of the most horrific things, like there's some horrific, like undeniably horrific things that people are capable of doing. Murders, one of them, red is one of them. Torture, torture. This is right up there. It's right up there with torture with Isis beheadings and shit. There was a guy on a talk show once that was talking about his. He's compelled to have sex with children and he's been sexually attracted to children all of his life, but he fights it off and he doesn't

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       do anything about it. He wanted people to understand it and he was talking about it openly and I was like, first of all, how brave is this guy that he's willing to go on television and do these interviews and talk about his compulsion even though he says he's innocent of the actual act itself. He has this compulsion and I think the spectrum of a different ways that the mind functions is so complex and so confusing as to what's the origin of these behavior patterns. Is it because of abuse is because of a malfunction? Is it a, is there a tumor like what the fuck is going on in someone's brain that leads them down these paths and I don't think that's been answered. No,

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       I mean what? Look at the take it back to be best reality and like having a, giving a horse a blow job. Like is there anything necessarily unethical about giving a host of blow job? Is the horses pushing back? I say no. What if? Yeah, exactly. So yeah, if you offer up your butt to a horse and he's. And he's just digging in there. I'm telling you though, like what is morally, what is actually morally wrong with fucking a horse? If the horse is into it, well the horse fucks you. First of all the horses atop the video of the guy getting fucked to death by the horse though is horrific. Of course available. How is he not able to get out of the situation with the horse out and pin? Those are the video starts out with a buddy of mine sent this to me.

Speaker 1:          01:09:44       I watched it 100 times to my computer right now, the screensaver. It's in there. I just copy and I put it on. Little flash drives leaving around my house just in case somebody decided to delete it off the Internet. I'm the guy. It's the video starts out and the guy is naked and he's bent over bale of Hay and then his friend, I use air quotes, grabs a horse his penis and leaves it up to his butt. And you're like, there is no fucking way. And then what does that even happen? How? Like what kind of what? No, he's up in his laptop. Ladies and gentlemen. Here we go. Don't be scared. Homey.com. What do you mean how, I mean, the guy's just got a giant, but it's really that simple. I know that like, you gotta like you gotTa Lube up a little bit beforehand, you're going to make sure that you're available, but that's a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:10:33       That's a lot of fingers. You got to put it in before the horse can go. Yeah, there's a lot going on there. It's not that simple. Um, it's just, it's again, it's one of those things like, what the fuck is it about a person's mind that allows that in there? Yeah. What and how do you get from A. I think this would be an amazing thing to try to actually being there in the bond, like straddled over the bale of Hay. I don't know how you. I'd be too. I'd be too bashful. Even if I wanted to do it, I'll be too. It's adorable. I wouldn't have the guts I think. I mean I'm obviously, I'm just thinking what the fuck do I know? But, but I'm pretending to have a horse walker. I think there's, there's just. Look, there's a reason why some people love jazz music and there's some people that love basketball and some people like sailing, some people hate the water and some people want to sunbathe all day and some people want to only go out at night and we're plucking people vary a lot. And in this gigantic broad variance of human beings every now and then put one pressure cooker spits out a doodle x get fucked by a horse.

Speaker 2:          01:11:41       Yeah, I totally take that, but what I mean is I'm amazed at the, at the people who can, who can translate their latent mental desires into actual real world experiences, whether that's climbing Mount Everest. I mean there's all kinds of things I'd like to do. Joe's eyes just getting real life as he looks at something on his laptop. I'm trying try to find Mr. I found it, Mr. like whether it's a, I'd like to go scuba diving with sharks. I'd like to go, uh, you know, I'd like to go scuba diving under Antarctic ice, but I haven't done it because I'm too much of a pussy and I'm too much of a pussy to get raped by a horse. That's what I'm saying, dude. It's not my thing. I don't get it. Why is it in the meantime I'm going to plug my podcast, which is which people should go and check out way the people alive.

Speaker 2:          01:12:21       We have paypal as well. One word, uh, and you can find it on the. We basically get three interesting people in a bar and we all talk about about what's going on in the world. Jim Norton, Artie Lange, beautiful. Looks like that. Great. Well New York's a good spot to do that. A lot of opinionated people. Yeah, it's fantastic. We did one here as well with Greg Fitzsimmons and uh, Fred's dollar and Zach Craig are funny people and uh, Joe was on it as well. If you want to check out episode 30, episode 30 Joe Rogan bars that, uh, that particular one is pine box rock shop, which is where we used to do it.

Speaker 1:          01:12:53       That was in, it was great. That place looks awesome. And now we do it in Williamsburg. Oh, of course you do. How dare Bushwick. Do you have to roll up the, the cops of your pants?

Speaker 2:          01:13:04       No, it wouldn't be a tide. It'd be like a bow tie, like done Sinatra Style and talked or. Exactly around my neck. And he found the video. I want to say some fucking. Here it is. I don't. Do I want to say this?

Speaker 1:          01:13:15       Able to undo this. Am I going to able to unsee this? Will make sure that he doesn't. It doesn't get shown on screen. Jamie, starring Mr Han's. So here's the gentlemen. There's a little dark, it looks like a night vision type thing because the guys lifting the horse's front, legs are on his shoulders or another horse. His front legs are on the Hay and the Horse is dick and it's a Holla. Look at this. No, I don't want to be seeing this. Dare he cued up and the guy's having a hard time getting it in at first. Right? And then it goes all the way. And is that one? It was just on the son. Yeah, he died. Sounds. Do you hear the sound? Yes. And now the Dick comes out and it's got liquid all over like, oh, is that what it was? Yeah. Can't look anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:14:06       Wonder if I can go to jail for having that. Like it's totally illegal. I'm like, I'm feeling I'm feeling a little violated. Right? Should a guy died that way. I just saw him in dying from a Dick Eighty minutes ago. I pulled into the car park here on a beautiful California day and if you'd told me then that in 80 minutes time I would have just watched a man die from being anal. He raped by a horse. How about the sound he makes? I wouldn't have believed you when you hear the sound again. No, I don't want to hear the sound again. Joe. This is a sound pleasant conversation is pleasant. What about doesn't happen to us. We should be happy. Be Happy. We figured out a way to not have this happen to us. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty easy to not have that happen to you. There are. There are so many things that have to happen in order for that to happen.

Speaker 5:          01:14:54       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       I hear that. That's the moment in which is which horses. Penis goes through his intestine and into his head. That's called. That's a wrap. That's a wrap for this life. Folks. Take care of. See the next dimension. Gilis fucking way to die. The Darwin awards. There's one who maybe lost. Awesome. Maybe it's better than being in a nursing home and having some guy kick you. Isn't there anything in between that allows my only two options? Either they get to be in a nursing home and said, somebody kicked me. I get to get mainly raped to death by a horse. That's it, we're options, but I mean, listen, my point of view is that this guy in getting fucked to death by a horse created this video and this video has provided me with hundreds of hours of entertainment that I would have never gotten without this guide of videos.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       Only one minute long. If you have 100 times. I've watched it so many times, I'm exaggerating, but think about all the people throughout the world who will now Google Mr Han's find that video. I'm sure it's up there somewhere. [inaudible] laugh their fucking ass off. Like that guy probably gave all those people a burst of happiness like through his death. Like do you think about like what you've done in life and what having those experiences and showing them to other people, what impact it has on them. How many people have watched people like do those, those bird suits, the squirrel suits where they jump off buildings and shit and they fly around and you watch me get a thrill out of it. Like, whoa. You watch those videos. You get a thrill out of that, right? Yeah. Gotcha guy. Bungee jumping and get a thrill. Yeah. Watch this and millions of people.

Speaker 1:          01:16:34       Sure. I think. I think it. Does that make you happy? The same way that the birdman videos make you happy? Yes. There's a difference here at dude dies getting anal. He raped by a horse. Bird guys die all the time. Yeah. I wouldn't want to save trees and shit. These motherfuckers. See that's what I'm talking about. This is a humble bored on the road, on the edge of the top of a skyscraper. These guys are spinning around one of these. First of all, you're counting on these Chinese lithium ion batteries. They were put together by slaves. Who knows if they're going to burst into flames. This guy's doing handstands. He's doing fucking handstands on top of a skyscraper. What

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       does that Dubai's? Yes. Where is he? It looks like I can't watch this. No, he's perfect example. If you saw that like that gives you a thrill, but if one of those guys did that and then when flying off the building like what did. I wouldn't like what if Mr. Hands. That was a video where he lived because he got fucked to death. A gang. I mean, you got fucked a gang at times where you get fucked to death.

Speaker 2:          01:17:28       I'd be, I'd be happier. I'd be happier if he lived, but then I wouldn't know. I also wouldn't be happy about that. I'm just enjoying the entire Mr Han's experienced Joe Rogan.

Speaker 3:          01:17:39       What if you met him and then he was annoying you? I wish that guy got fucked to death. He probably would be. Did you hear,

Speaker 2:          01:17:45       did you hear that Oklahoma has had to change there. I was just looking this up. But when we were talking about pedophilia that uh, there was a rape case in. This is not something to laugh about, but it is interesting about how we define rape were a 17 year old kid. This was last month. Uh, and a 16 year old. He made her. Well, here's what happened. She was really drunk. They'd been drinking in the park with some friends. He gave her a ride home. She woke up, I think in the middle of the night, completely deliriously drunk, and her mother or grandmother took her to the hospital because she was so drunk. She woke up in hospital. First thing she kind of really remembered was the doctor's asking her what kind of sexual activity she had happened because they'd found a some of the 17 year old's DNA around her mouth and on her legs.

Speaker 2:          01:18:35       She said, I've got no recollection. They went to the guy and he said, yes, you want it to give me a blow job, and she gave me a blow job when she was like, blackout drunk. So she charges him for rape and the Oklahoma court found that it wasn't forcible rape, so now they're having to change Oklahoma's laws because the only thing that it would have been that would have like, it basically has to be forcible. It's called forceable sodomy. Right. And if the judge was saying if a victim is so intoxicated that they are completely unconscious, then it's not actually forcible because there's nothing like. They weren't forced to do it. They didn't even know that they were or weren't doing it. Jesus. Well, how do you define that then? Well, exactly. I don't know, but I mean clearly you should not be going around putting your Dick in unconscious sixteen-year-olds mouths clearly, but at the same time I can sort of understand that maybe it's not the same level of horribleness as like just flat out raping somebody. There's

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       also the problem with the girl possibly consenting at the time just being so fucked up. She doesn't remember consenting. Right? Especially she's 16 and it's one of her first ever sexual experiences or first ever drunk sexual experiences we should assume. Yes. So it is entirely possible that this boy who was only a few months older than her didn't have the wherewithal to understand that she was compromised to the point where she couldn't consent. So who, who are both drunk, that gets real weird. It gets real weird and we don't know exactly what words were exchanged. What actually did happen, what the history of these two together was like. We don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:20:10       I mean, if I had to, if I had a son, I would have to say now, just never ever have any sexual relations with anybody who's

Speaker 3:          01:20:15       drunk because that's frankly, it's like getting fucked when they're drunk. Guys like fucking their girlfriends when they're drunk. What do you mean? Some everybody who like who didn't. Who's early sexual experiences with, with done sober what, what have you. You're both drunk like that's. There was a big thing that feminists were trying to push for a while and they kind of abandoned it because they realized that it literally makes 90 percent of the population a rapist and they were saying you shouldn't have sex. Even with your husband. If your husband is drunk and you're sober, don't have sex with them. Yeah. Logistically saying that old drunk sex is non consensual sex with because it's full. Makes it ripe. You can't consent. But then the argument becomes, well, how come you're responsible for driving your car when you're drunk? You're responsible for that. If you get caught, you're know you're not supposed to drive your car when you're drunk.

Speaker 3:          01:20:59       It's not like, oh, I was too drunk. I couldn't consent to drive my car. No, you're responsible. You're a fucking adult. You responsible for violence. You can't beat somebody up and say, well, I didn't know I was drunk, but when it comes to sexuality for whatever reason, you're not responsible for your actions. If you're intoxicated, well you are. If you. If you have the right pissed, not just not the right p, know that women were saying this is part of the argument that of man fucks you and he's drunk and you're sober. Even though he's the. He's the proactive one, right? That he's being. He's being raped. Yes. That sex with a drunk person is rape because they cannot consent. Well then you might as well just as you say, make every single activity that you do while drunk, but the real problem becomes it becomes an attack on men because it's very, very rare that any woman ever gets in trouble for having sex with a man that's drunk, but women and men have both been drunk and the men have been accused of being rapist. Whereas a woman wasn't. That was the Occidental University then. Yeah, that's right. College or university? What is it? College College, I think. Yeah, I think so. Uh, I mean that was the guy suing and frustrated.

Speaker 2:          01:22:03       Let me so much because this is one of those areas where like Islam or like political correctness or like black lives matter. I feel like the moment you try to introduce nuance you can be very quickly taken out of context and accused of being pro that thing like 100 percent, you know, because I'll say something like this and then peer supporters of mine on twitter will be like, yeah, like fuck her. Or like, you know, let's. Right, but the day that is not what I'm saying that whatsoever.

Speaker 3:          01:22:27       That's why it's horrific that they can take what you're doing right now and take it and make a little youtube clip out of it. Take that clip and put a title on it. Josh Zap thinks rapes. Okay. Exactly. That's right. It's really not. I do think it's okay. In fact, I encourage everybody to go out and write a funny, funny, no place for jokes. No, no, no more. No more jokes. But a Dojo.

Speaker 2:          01:22:52       Yeah. If like if, if I were to say for example that a preying upon somebody, praying upon a woman with like a knife and forcing her against her will to have sex with you is a class of behavior then coming in an unconscious in your unconscious girlfriend's mouth. Would that like is that, is it. Have we gotten to a stage where it's just not possible to even talk about that because we just have to keep mouthing the slogan of sexual violence is unacceptable all the time. Therefore there's no way of even distinguishing in the law between different levels. You know, someone who had a boyfriend, a 17 year old boyfriend who makes a mistake, should go to jail for just the same length of time as a repeat serial Predator who preys upon women.

Speaker 3:          01:23:37       Well, we don't want to admit that there is any difference and that all these things are exactly the same and one of the reasons why, because because what you just said, just even introducing it as a possibility. Like there might be a variation. There might be a there, there might be a grade of like, this is a level 10 rate, but this is a level nine rape. This is level eight. Like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. As soon as you start getting into that, it's almost like you're a rape apologist or you a rape supporter, or we want to be able to boil things until fucking headline a clickbait headline and spit it out there. Here's my thoughts on rape, you know, and that's why the idea of everyone who's drunk is getting raped is so ridiculous because it's like we've all been with someone that we love and we got drunk and we wanted to have sex with them when we did. No one got raped.

Speaker 2:          01:24:27       Well, and it's not only ridiculous, it's also demeaning to the victims of really terrible, right? Yes. Right. I mean, it's also diminishes. They have their legitimate concern.

Speaker 3:          01:24:36       It's also insanely sexist because it shows women as being these people that can't make good decisions while they're intoxicated. Whereas the men know exactly what they're doing, so they raped the woman. So the man and the women, even though they're both engaging in the exact same, the exact same act, they're both saying they want to do it. The man is the, he's the attacker. Whereas the woman is an innocent person who doesn't know any better because she's drunk.

Speaker 2:          01:25:01       There was a pace on the other. I was waiting on the plane in the Sunday Times, uh, yesterday about the woods survivor. How the woods survivor has been, has, is getting used now. It was really interesting patients in the New York Times magazine almost with survivor. I am. I had the flu and they were making the point that like when everything, when every act of sexual violence gets, gets labeled with, I'm a survivor of sexual violence. Even if that was just unwanted touching on the subway, then like, what does it mean to be. What do you mean you survived it? Were you ever. Were you ever going to die because someone likes slapped you on the ass in the workplace? Not to, not to say that it's okay to do that, but again, you're just compressing all of the actual real horrifying survival stories down to the level of someone looked at me funny and

Speaker 3:          01:25:47       yeah, you can't call it survival, but you're a victim. Yeah. Yeah. Bit survivor sounds better. It sounds much use. You're barely made it. Survivor of bullying. I saw that someone someone wrote were a survivor of high school bullying. Yeah. What the fuck happened to you? What? What was so bad? What did someone try to stab you? Did somebody beat you up to the point of view almost dying or did someone just annoy you all the time and make you feel bad? Is that what happened?

Speaker 2:          01:26:13       There are a few. There are only a few scenarios in which I think you should legitimately be called a survivor. A bear attack wouldn't be one of them. Shark attack, shark attack. Another one. Basically any kind of large carnivorous animal attacking you online. You man done. You go through it, but through them all tiger or leopard, monkey. Mayor Killed by monkeys. Really? She here that maybe we'll the olive African, African elephants are going to be dead in 20 years. What? That's what I was reading an article. They were saying there's places in Africa that have so many elephants. They have to kill them. Yeah, I know. But there is enormous. This is one of the things that people don't understand. Why is he in an area of Africa? Africa itself is fucking huge. Yes. And there's a conference with all of the people who are. There we go. No magazine. African Americans could be extinct within 20 days

Speaker 3:          01:27:00       if poaching maybe

Speaker 2:          01:27:03       because all of the, uh, there's a conference of African leaders at the moment going on to figure out how they can, uh, they can tackle poaching. Wow. But Africa is a continent. It's fun. Enormous city. It's bigger than almost all the continents combined. I know. But if you keep killing them at a much larger rate than they procreate, so over time you're going to wipe them all out.

Speaker 3:          01:27:23       What's scary is people are still hunting them. Yeah. On top of the poaching. So there's, there's these places that develop African hunting safaris for elephants. So they raise elephants in these high fence operations just so people can go over there and hunt them and that's one of the ways that they ensure that their population stay high. It's very fucking twisted. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:27:46       Trump's kids, you've seen those photos of trump's sons holding our son Shit. Holding up Jaguars and yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:27:51       that whole African hunting thing. I. I tell people if you think it's bizarre with from a cursory glance, you gotta look at Luther's documentary about these

Speaker 2:          01:28:03       good honey. We mentioned this before because I've been a fan since day since day one, but that, that episode is just

Speaker 3:          01:28:09       killer. That one's nuts. I love the end of it. When the guy's going crazy, you need to ask him all the questions was like Africa, he's fucked, fucked. He's fit. You don't understand content. It is fucked. And when he was saying that, really kind of get it. I hate that term. Poacher two poachers that dark term because a lot of those people that are poaching or just fucking starving, they're poor as fuck. We have this idea that these are like these mercenaries that come over to steal ivory so they can make money off of it. There's a lot of people that are killing these animals that are homeless, have no way out. There's nothing there for them. They don't know any better. They're not educated. They're just starving and someone says, Hey, you give me that Rhino Horn. I'll give you 500 bucks, and they're like, Holy Shit, 500 bucks, and then they'll kill as many rhinos as they can before they get killed.

Speaker 3:          01:28:57       It's so dark. I have a friend who went over there. You went over there to Africa and he said he was on a hunting safari where they have these enormous places where they have these hunting camps where there it's a 10 hour drive to the other side of the ranch. I mean enormous, enormous territory and while they were there, they encountered these quote unquote poachers and he said, the people from the honey cam just shoot it. The poachers, they just shoot at them like the coyotes. They shoot it. These people like, I mean they don't even give them a chance, they just shoot at them and they're allowed to. It's illegal and when they shoot someone, he asked him like, what do you do if you kill someone? And he's like, most of the time we let the hyenas sorted out. Most of the time we let the hyenas short. Let me just think about how fucking crazy life is in that part of the world that this guy is actually saying that we're pretty fucking lucky and I'm guessing that trump's kids are probably not that poor that they need to be hunting that way. They're over there doing those. Um, big game so far.

Speaker 2:          01:30:09       Yeah. There's one is a photo of one of them holding up an elephant's trunk. Just the, just the dismembered trunk. Just a big old nose just hanging in there because little shit. What? Trump couldn't pull that up.

Speaker 3:          01:30:21       I want to see it. Yeah, I do. I do know that they've had to kill elephants, certain areas that have infiltrated these villages and start killing people. But the question is what, how, how fucked with did they get before they started killing people? Like what's the actual reality?

Speaker 2:          01:30:37       Well, I mean as you, as you say, like what's the reality of the human beings line? So we're doing this as well. I was just in a, I would, when I was coming back from Australia, I spent a week in India and uh, in Mumbai did, there's this company that does a tools of the biggest slum in Asia, like the kind of slumdog millionaire slum. And they, and they work in development there with some of the poorest people in the world. There's an area, it's an area of the site, it's called Dharavi and it's in Mumbai, it's the, it's one of the biggest slums in the world and it's an area the size of half the size of central park and it's got like 2 million people living in it. Jesus. And they do development stuff there. And you can walk through and these, I mean you feel a little bit weird like going through this place, like it's almost like disaster porn or something like huge canals which just smell. It's just shit and like dead dogs and peace and just just, I mean, but you know, what people are getting on with life, the law firm, there are, there are soccer balls that plan with like, you know, kids are scrounging around in the dust and the dirt and the grime people. People are fucking resilient in amazing ways.

Speaker 3:          01:31:48       Well they weren't. We wouldn't be here because it's 2016 shit where you go to the supermarket and you buy a chicken breast. A wish. So out of touch touch the most recent of recent. I mean that's one of the more amazing things about how upset people are about how life is today. Like God damn it, it's the easiest it's ever been ever. This is the greatest time in the history of the world. Yeah. And everyone's. The Sky's falling

Speaker 2:          01:32:12       when we don't. And as our lives get better and better, we don't. We fail to accurately calibrate like any, any benchmark. Like you always. It's like there was a study that came out that 47 percent of Americans could not come up with $400 if they needed to. If they suddenly got an unexpected bill, right? Almost half of Americans in other words are right on the brink of the poverty line, but in terms of just being able to come up with cash, but how do we get into and get ourselves into that scenario? We, we fail to recognize how prosperous we are. I mean, if most of the people who are listening to this podcast are in the top five percent of income earners globally, more than a lot of them will be in the top one percent and the top one percent, 20, 34 grand a year of global global incomes. Is it? Okay. So there you go. And even even within the United States, I mean the top five percent is, is surprisingly low. It's like 50 grand or something. Well, I think it's more than that, but I think it's like mm. I thought it was either way. Either way. We are incredibly blessed and amazingly fortunate and it's so hard to snip hassles out of our complacency and realize fuck. Things actually are surprisingly convenient and easy for us.

Speaker 3:          01:33:27       Yeah, I'm gonna stop whining overall, but if you're. One of those people that can't come up with that 400 bucks and the $400 bill comes, it seems daunting.

Speaker 2:          01:33:35       Yes. And I'm not blaming, blaming people for it. I've been in, I've had times in my life where I've been below, you know, wellwell onto water.

Speaker 3:          01:33:43       Sure. We all have. But I think that's also probably one of the reasons why you became ambitious and why you worked hard and why you're in a position right now where you don't have to worry about that. Yeah. Because you worked your way through it and you figure your way through adversity, you know, has an interesting subject because, um, I had uh, Eddie Wong in really recently and he brought up something that I thought was preposterous. He brought up the idea of what do they call it, basic income where you give people $35,000 a year to live. And I was like, get the fuck Outta here. But then I started looking into it and when I started looking into it, one of the things that I was intrigued by was like, okay, how much of crime and how much of people's aberrant behavior could be. You could write it off to them being desperate and needy and poor and feeling hopeless and how much of that crime would not take place if they got $35,000 a year and if these are people that are just going to fuck off anyway, but this way they're gonna fuck off, but they won't be committing crime because they're going to have a steady income for the rest of their life.

Speaker 3:          01:34:48       Is that feasible? Like how much money is there out there? Could you give everybody in America $35,000 a year up to a certain number, right? Once you hit a cutoff,

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       like you hit like I would say like a quarter million dollars a year, you don't get the 35 grand anymore. Like you have plenty of money. Here's the. Here's the thing that the great utility of a basic income is that you don't have to fill out forms and prove that you deserve it, that everybody gets it because it's so. It's super, super simple. Where's it coming from? Well, yes. You can't start with $35,000 a year, but you can. I've heard proposals, look, Alaska has this already. They just call it an oil revenue. Everyone in Alaska gets a check from the government, which is a cut of Alaska's oil revenue. They basically get a universal basic income. It's not nearly enough to live on. It might be a thousand dollars a year or something. I'll be corrected on this, but there are all kinds of experiments. I had Felix Salmon on my podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:35:39       Who's at? Who's over at slate? I don't know if you know him. He's a. he's a money. A big, very interesting money guy. He has a podcast called the money put the slate money podcast and he's a big advocate of this idea and there's a. yeah, you should. You should get him on and he's great. He's based out of New York, but he's Felix Salmon. Like the fish, I'll, I'll send you his. I'll text you his details after, after the show. Um, I'm making a note to myself right now. Uh, and that he was basically saying there's a place in like there's a jurisdiction and I think Finland or Sweden, which has actually trying this out just to test the proposition of like how much less will people actually work. If everyone gets a basic income, how much of a deterrent will it be bothering to get a job?

Speaker 2:          01:36:21       How much will it cost? Well, $35,000 a year would be would be a lot of money. Well, 30,000 times 300 million is the thing you would start. It are a lot of savings, right? So here's the weird thing about this idea is that libertarians like it as well as progressives because for Libertarians, this is a way of getting rid of social security, getting rid of Medicare, getting rid of food stamps, getting rid of all of these different programs and streamlining everything. I mean, think of how hard it is to do your taxes and to like to fill in the forms and to figure out what you're supposed to get. This would just be a check from the government. Everybody gets it, no questions asked. You go out and you buy what you need to buy. Now with healthcare is expensive as it is in the United States. That's not going to work for old people.

Speaker 2:          01:37:07       They're going to be able to pay for our healthcare and health insurance and also social security and also survive on $35,000 a year, but if you just thinking in terms of the budget, if you got rid of those massive line items in the budget, medicare and social security and so on, then you will be able to start to think about affording things like that. So you might start with just $10,000 a year for everybody and work your way up from there and just test it. I think a stat, I think one of the states should start to do it on a. on a more aggressive level, just like Colorado is going to be playing around with universal healthcare at the November election because we'd baby, we'd money. Come on son. I love it. I think it's an interesting idea of Colorado decided to do that and decided to give every state resident $35,000 a year. The problem would be everybody moved. Everybody moved there, right? Yeah. But, but I

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       think this is a possible solution to the rise of robots that's not as crazy as crazy as it sounds like. I've just been smoking weed at the time. Um, I, I think that they were going to be fewer and fewer jobs for individual human beings as robots get better and better at making shit. No, I think everybody believes that and also that they're going to be cheaper and cheaper to get robots. Yeah. And so what happens when you've got a, you know, silicon valley and Hollywood pumping out huge amounts of stuff which, which give us a massive GDP. A larger GDP growth is still happening, but it takes fewer and fewer people. I mean, Uber is a transportation company that doesn't employ anybody. Facebook doesn't employ very many people. Uber's been challenged on that. That gets really problematic when you deal without the actual labor laws and things.

Speaker 1:          01:38:54       One. But that's one particular scenario. I think one thing that's happening that's interesting is that people are gravitating more towards craftsmanship and crafts and people are gravitating towards handmade things and they're gravitating towards things that actually have. Like if somebody. Like if I go to a store and I buy a knife, okay, I buy a kitchen knife, um, you know, it's nice, it cuts my vegetables. But if I know a guy who's a blacksmith and he actually makes a knife and he and he does all this craftsmanship and puts together the handle. And that to me is like there's a feeling that you get from this object when you're using it. Like this is someone's craftsmanship. This is someone's creation. Someone learned a trade. They learned the art form of making a, a functional piece of kitchen ware. And I'm using it here. But speaking of the 47 percent of people who kind of come up with $400, I mean you, you can afford to care about such things, but the majority of people are just going to buy a pack of steak knives for 1499 at Walmart.

Speaker 1:          01:39:55       Right? That's true. But that's also the case with everything, with clothes and with all sorts of different things. But for the person themselves, someone who learns a trade and someone who learns a crap, someone that learns how to make furniture, I hopefully go more that way and become less of a disposable. Just China fueled like commodity consuming country and becoming cameron about the quality of stuff. In some ways I think we are for people who can afford it. I think it's becoming for the people that are looking for something to do like the that has meaning in their life. There's like extreme meaning and hand produced. Things like when you buy something from someone like a, a piece of office furniture and you know, this guy made it like someone made my friend Eric made this table. Yeah. Unless table. We hired them to do it. Yeah. He got on your mind. Not only that, look at the fucking welding and all the different shit to it. I mean this guy, he did an awesome job in, in creating this and there's. There's like something to someone making something. You're always going to remember

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       where it came from. Yeah, that's right. It's a cutting board. Somebody puts together a nice hard wood cutting board, you know, like you like, oh, this is a guy made this.

Speaker 2:          01:41:02       Well maybe, and then in terms of the question of whether or not people can afford to buy such things, maybe the universal basic income means that we don't necessarily have to all be buying those things because the people who make them are going to be getting the universal income. This is the theory which is that the. If the overall pie is bigger every year, then you just have to figure out how to allocate the tax. That Pie. Maybe that means that you have to have super huge taxes on silicon valley in some way in order to fund the universal basic income, but if there aren't enough people being employed to fund what the government needs to do on the basis of a conventional income tax, but there's more stuff being produced going around, there's more wealth, you should still be able to extract that well somehow and maybe people can. More people can if everyone got a universal basic income and people can become a poet or an autism, all knife maker or a table maker and they don't need to necessarily be able to sustain their living doing that. There are more opportunities for creative

Speaker 3:          01:41:59       output. What's interesting to me is that it might relax. People I think will certainly. Yeah. I mean imagine not having to worry about where the next meal comes from. Well, that's where it started ringing true to me. Like I was making fun of Eddie talking about it, but then I thought about it for quite a while afterwards and then I started reading some things on it that sort of reinforced these new ideas that I was starting to play around with and one of the things that I was thinking is how much of what people do that's fucked up they're doing out of desperation or out of frustration and how much could that be eliminated and how much would that change society and are ambitious people just. I mean you're not talking about anything where you could fucking go ball and on 35 grand a year or 12 grand a year, whatever you, whatever you give them 12 grand a year. Let's say that you're barely going to live off that, but you have enough money for food. You have enough money for food. Hopefully you got enough money for rent. If you get some part time jobs here are there. Hopefully you can survive, but you're less desperate and more dependent upon society. You're more dependent upon the rules of society.

Speaker 2:          01:43:04       Well, I mean to see what countries look like when that sort of thing happens, even though it's not a perfect analogy, just look at the countries of northern Europe or even you were talking about Melbourne, you know, a country like Australia where it's by no means perfect. There are still poor people, but gee, the levels of poverty are a lot less than they are here and the number of people in grinding abject, absolute poverty is almost nonexistent in comparison to the way that you see it here in the states because we have social, we have social safety nets that are just much more robust, but you only have 20 million people, but even so, I never buy that argument. It everything is scalable. Joe. The fact that we. Yeah, because we only have 20 million people, but we also have a proportionately fewer number of taxpayers. You have. You have tons more people and tons more taxpayers. Like look at Germany. Germany's a big country that's. They've got 80 million people and they manage to have very,

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       very few people basically know people in abject poverty. That might be a bad example because they're a mess right now. Like you know, Germany is a mess with the immigration issue. That is separate, but they're economy is not a mess. Yeah, but they're socially a massive scale. I mean that's because of Syria. Well, yeah. Well there's. That whole thing is so bizarre where the mayor of Munich was telling girls to keep to themselves and not look at anybody and it's crazy. You know, I'm not advocating that America should invite a 10 million on stream into documented Syrians. Fucking insane. But you could certainly. It could certainly imagine a system in which it was a lot easier for people to wait. You did just didn't have entrenched levels of, of grinding poverty. I just wonder what the cost would be and what could. Is there a mathematical equation that can be worked out where that makes sense.

Speaker 1:          01:44:42       I wonder, you know, not doing the math. Felix Felix will know who's Felix? Felix Salmon, the English guy who does. I thought it was like Siri. I'm like, what are you using a windows phone. You asked Felix. It sounds like that sounds like something wholesale Felix's hasn't really posh English accent, so it sounds like the kind of person who you who you would expect to voice one of those things. Do you remember ask Jeeves? Was everybody used to go to that before Google was around? I know to ask jeeves. I mean I didn't have a really useful. Maybe it was. Maybe I'm too young or something. Was it was you typed in [inaudible] dot com? Don't remember. Did you have to phrase things as a question? Sounds stupid now. I don't know. I don't remember. I know. I'm sure I asked jeeves a few things. I just don't remember what they were.

Speaker 1:          01:45:25       Now that I'm thinking about it, James, show me boobs. I'll james. Show me a guy getting raped by a horse. What's this? Ask Dot com now. Oh, just not asked her a question and it would tell you the answer. Where's the tallest waterfall in the. Okay. Ask this. How much would it cost to give all Americans? I love saying in dollars. When you're typing then okay, Bam. Dot Com is not going to help you with us. Hey, you don't look it up. It would cost 3 trillion to give everyone $10,000 a year by that time, the extra two point five and Jesus Christ. God. Damn, that's great. Yeah, that makes sense. Three more than 3 trillion to get to give him 10 grand a. okay, so gs. 9 trillion plus to give everybody authority, but you wouldn't give everybody because everybody who makes over a certain amount should have to fucking work it out.

Speaker 1:          01:46:19       But people are so gross. They would just stay under $250,000. I'll make $240. Not Give Up, you know, because if you let over $1 you would. You would have to. But I think if you were gonna start means testing it, then you didn't have to be a sliding scale so that you didn't encounter that problem. Right? So if you hit it to 50 then you only get 30. If you hit two 60 and they get 25, but then it becomes complicated and that that negates a lot of the benefit when you're talking about what you really want is just a wife desperately poor

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       people to not be desperately poor. And there are simpler ways than giving everybody a universal basic income. There are simpler ways,

Speaker 3:          01:46:56       but I think the real work, the real important thing is figuring out a way to stop children from growing up in desperation to stop children from growing up in an environment like a. I, this guy on Michael would, I got to get back to him this week because we're working on a new date, but he was a Baltimore police officer and he talked in great detail about real institutional racism in Baltimore where they, you know, they had literally areas where you couldn't sell black people homes and this had been established in the 19 sixties. And because of that, those areas are still fucked. Those areas like there, they're still to this day, he found something from the 19 seventies, the, uh, the police officers in his district did where it was like a mandate, like what they were supposed to do and where the crime was and he's like, it was exactly the same place is exactly the same crimes as they were dealing with in the 2000. And he's like, how few tile and fucking crazy is this that you're dealing with this pattern that never gets fixed, never gets corrected. And just, they just, cops keep arresting the same people in the same areas for the same problems. And it's like, Whoa,

Speaker 2:          01:48:08       you know, they've done studies about what the most effective way to, uh, to help poor people is because oftentimes people on the left will be, will be in favor of food stamps or like a bit of public schools and so on. All of those things are great, but a lot of recent research suggests that just giving people money is more effective than trying to figure out all of these tweaks because we don't like giving poor people money because we think, well, they're just gonna spend it on drugs or they gonna spend it on booze or something like that with cigarettes, cigarettes, or food up here, but it turns out, and this applies whether you're talking about desperately poor people in Africa or desperately poor people in downtown Baltimore. If you give them money, most people use it for good ends. The the, the thing they really want the most is to eat and be able to pay their bills and to get out of the situation they're in. A minority of people will spend, will blow it on booze and cigarettes, but they are a small minority. Yeah, I know what their needs are more better than we know what their needs are. There's this paternalistic idea that we always have, like we have to figure out how to get people out of poverty. People know how to get themselves out of poverty if they just had the resources to do so, so just give them a bit of money.

Speaker 3:          01:49:14       Yeah. It's also this absolute realization that this is not a level playing field and that someone corn in the slums of Inglewood is not the same as someone who was born in

Speaker 2:          01:49:24       so crazy about libertarians when they, when they go on about how everyone should be free. Yeah, of course. Everyone should be free. I am as libertarian as you can get, but within within the understanding that it's crazy to say that people are equally for the person in beverly who's born in Beverly hills to a white middle class. Upper class family is only as free as the baby born in the slums of Baltimore. This is crazy. Of course you should use the, the, I think, the power of the state to be able to level the playing field a little bit. Just to skim a little bit off the Beverly Hills family and give a little bit to the Baltimore family. I don't see what's so tyrannical about that. Well yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:50:02       because you're not coming from an even start point, right? So, and then there's also this notion that as a country we were only as strong as the weakest link. Right? So if we created a system where we had less people in desperation, less people in despair, less less losers, we would be more winners will get our shit together, we would, we would produce more, we'd be more effective. I wonder. I just wonder what the actual numbers are because like how much money is being spent every year on things that we don't need, how much, how much money from our taxes goes to bureaucracy and bullshit and it's really distorted representative government that most people don't agree with. How much of that, how much of it is just fucking cronyism and handing money back and forth?

Speaker 2:          01:50:49       Well, each other, I'll tell you what, we don't spend a lot of money and we don't spend a lot of money on bureaucracy and waste in your like people. People who want to cut government spending will often say like, you know, first thing I'm going to do when I get into, when I get to Congress, as I'm going to repaint, you know, my congressional office or something, or I'm gonna, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna. Throw out the fancy stuff and I'm going to get an old couch like these. This is not what we're spending our money on. What we're spending our money on is the military and Medicare and social security basically. So right in healthcare costs and stopped and cut the military and you would. And that's where the big, the big, the military. But then what happened, son, let me tell you something.

Speaker 2:          01:51:31       Freedom Ain't free. They're going to come over here and take our jobs and kick our women into the curb or something. I've been, I've been having a twitter argument with a person who's been saying that, uh, that the reason why America's roads are so bad. It's because we spend too much on foreign aid. That's may do. I'm sorry. Fuck. When am I? Just say it because I know Britain, Britain spends three or four times more per capita on foreign aid. Sweden spend six times more per capita if you've seen the road in Sweden. It really quite nice. Yeah. We have more roads, don't we? Of course, but again, you also have been more mindful. You have more tax payers to pay for them. Just looking at overall numbers. We spend more money because we have more roads. Yeah, and you spend more money on foreign aid as well, but there were more likely to share it.

Speaker 2:          01:52:11       I'm a petroleum trader. I'm going to get. I'm going to be an egg with the opinion. Here's something. Here's something. Here's a players, a reform which you could support, which would really help you figure out where you. Where the money goes. When you get your tax bill at the end of the year, your tax statement from the irs, they could as they do in Australia and a bunch of other countries have a little bar graph, a colorful little graph with lines showing how much you've spent on everything. So in Australia, if you, if you paid $18,000 in tax that year, then there's a little bit, a little purple line on the graph which says, you know, you spent four, $782 and sixteen cents on Medicare, spent this much on security, spend this much on foreign aid and then you can actually see it there. That's great. There's a proposal in front of Congress which some Democrats are pushing to bring this in here.

Speaker 2:          01:52:58       And also to streamline the way that you do your taxes because in a lot of other countries, apart from the states, you don't have to go through the rigmarole of filling out all of your taxes, the government. Because when, when you do a job and you get a, you have to supply the irs with a 10, 99 or a w two at the end of the year. Remember that the person who gave you the 10, 99 or the w two also sent a copy to the irs. The irs already has it. They could just fill it out themselves. Instead. They make you do it and it's difficult and cumbersome. But in a lot of other countries like the UK and Australia, they have the option of just signing off on it and saying, yeah, okay, this looks good. You can just do my taxes for me and the and the proposals to make to simplify doing your taxes are being pushed by Democrats.

Speaker 2:          01:53:42       And I find it wildly ironic that the people who oppose these policies are Republicans and Grover Norquist, the anti tax crusader who you would think would want to make it easier, but it's in their interest to make taxes as difficult to do and as difficult to understand as possible because they want you to continue hating taxes as much as possible. Also, the republic, the military industrial complex that the Republicans essentially work for. Don't want you to know how much we spend on the Pentagon so that they oppose this bar graph idea because they know that the biggest line item would be this massive thing and you'd be like, do we really need to be spending that much on the military? Or is this really a jobs program where we're building nuclear submarines that depending on doesn't want important districts in Delaware, Delaware, just so that the, the we, we can keep some, some jobs. They're in a factory that's producing munitions that it doesn't, does it no longer needs to be?

Speaker 1:          01:54:33       Well, I think one of the good things about someone proposing something like that as you get to look at who's opposing it and when someone's proposing something that make sense and it makes it, unless there's some sort of exorbitant fee that's involved in giving people a detailed rundown of where their money goes, then you would say, well, someone's against transparency and if you're against transparency or against freedom, you fuck your against America. Play the music, Jimmy Man, the free home of the brave. Goddammit. I want to know where my fucking taxes go. Yes. If you're anti tax, then you should be pro transparency and text. We found out my taxes. I went to welfare cigarettes.

Speaker 1:          01:55:09       That's where they didn't go booze on pills for the kids. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine we should spend more on. I just wonder what the number would be like, what to do, the universal basic income. Yeah. I wonder what would the number would be and what would be. Just try to keep it up. I'll tell you if I got a rant coming on. I'll tell you if I got a rant coming on me right now. I'm not feeling that America even better when I do an Australian accent and you play the US national anthem and it sounds really weird. Cognitive dissonance. I

Speaker 2:          01:55:40       play at Jamie. Play the anthem. Liliana, let's just get a little of a bit of patriotism going here. Mate. I want to tell you a thing or two about this, about the United States, but talking to you. I don't know. Overdo it. Can't fake it. All right. Okay. What is country? A Nation of brave, courageous men and women who fought for years now. Centuries.

Speaker 1:          01:56:04       Okay. Hold on. Stop. What about non binary sexual people, men or women? You being transphobic? Yes. You're very transphobic.

Speaker 2:          01:56:13       Sit on my podcast the other day that people who vote for Hillary because they voted because they. Because she's a woman only voting for her because she's got a vagina. Someone on twitter said that that was transferred it because there are women who don't have vaginas. Yeah, I disagree.

Speaker 1:          01:56:26       Yeah. There's an x and a y chromosome. There's a lot of genetics you might identify with being a woman. If you've got a dick though, we have a real problem. I'm happy to call them limit if they want to be called women. I really don't have a problem with it, but don't cut. Don't call me. It's not transphobic for me to make a generalization that most women have vaginas. Um, I saw an opening to call you transphobic and I jumped on it because it's there. So I sank your battleship. I got 12. I saw it as they're playing games. You don't have to have a vagina to be a woman. Yeah. You. How about fuck you? Jesus Christ. What do you think about this North Carolina law though? About this? Is Mrs the bathroom.

Speaker 2:          01:57:03       I'm so conflicted about this because I also, I also got into trouble on my podcast was talking about this. So I think it's obviously a silly beat up and I think that trans people have been and will continue to use bathrooms, uh, and we shouldn't worry about it and I don't think that people should be passing laws against it, but I also think it's disingenuous of Pro Trans people and I regard myself as broadly pro trans, just in the same sense that I'm broadly pro, hey, whatever floats your boat, just live the life that you want to live. Whoever you as do our. Um, I do think it's disingenuous when they start saying that people who have the outward appearance of the gender on their birth certificate should be able to use the opposite a restroom and that nobody should have a problem with that because they declare themselves to be trans.

Speaker 2:          01:57:54       So I'm talking, for example about there was, I saw a facebook argument about this where a friend of a friend of mine on facebook is a trans woman who was assigned male at birth and has no intention of transitioning at all. Right? So she has a beach, she's a fat guy with a beard who plays guitar. And that's what all of her photos are and she doesn't want to have her dick cut off and she doesn't want to grow breasts and she doesn't want to lose her beard and she's arguing that it's transphobic to say that she shouldn't be able to use the women's restroom. And other people were saying, you can understand how like a parent might be concerned if their daughter went into the girls' restroom and then what appears to be a large be added fat man walks in after her, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       that is not necessarily transphobic. And then all of a sudden she's like, how dare you say that? There has not been a single instance of a trans person abusing this is just like the gay fear back in the 1970. If you're claiming that trans people are more likely to be pedophiles and blah, blah, blah. No, no, no. We're not saying that. We're just saying, how do you expect us to know the difference between you a trans woman who looks like a man and a man when you're being reasonable? And that's the problem. This is not a reasonable discussion. Now, here's what's really ironic, what we really should be concerned with is not the trans people we should really be concerned with is heterosexual people pretending to be transpeople heterosexual people who are in fact sexual predators, who all they have to do to have to pretend to be trans.

Speaker 1:          01:59:29       I mean they would do. Oh, I see what you mean. Like all they will have to do is to wear a dress and go to the woman's room and say they're trans and they could do whatever the fuck they want once they're in there and that's the real issue is not the actual trans people. That's rice people that are using this very ambiguous law there. I mean this is a very ambiguous distinction. If someone identifies with the opposite sex without having any outward appearance of being that opposite sex, all guy would have to do is say I'm trans and you can go into a female restroom. I think the likely it's not going to happen. Yeah. I don't recognize it's exactly. It's a possibility, but again, it comes back to the conversation about rape or about Islam or about what about like black lives matter or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:00:10       This is a new what we're trying to have a nuanced conversation and it's impossible to have because all you're allowed to be is either pro trans or you're a religious evangelical bigot, right? Yes. You're not allowed. There's no. There's no middle ground. We just have to hunker down joe into a little trenches just and have a war of attrition. When I'm on one side and you're on the other side and the last man fucking stands, it's like, whoa, Whoa, one. We don't passion dial all over again. Just firing at each other on twitter. You're not allowed to have a nuanced perspective. Don't you think this is a direct result of the Bush administration like we were talking about? I really do think that that's what it is. I think everybody was so scared and conservativism was at at such a high point that the rebound from that, the rebound from all the anti gay hysterica.

Speaker 1:          02:00:51       I mean that administration was right with homophobia, ripe with all sorts of different types of discrimination. It was a fucking weird, weird time dissolves the lift too much and I think it also fails to recognize the changes that social media has brought. I don't think this would be as bad altogether. Yeah. Twenty four hour media. Yes. Social media. Like Stephen Fry quit in February. He was one of the first adopters and he was like, it used to be this like this, this lake in the forest where you could run and jump and play and now it's a fitted swamp with everyone pissing in the pool. I'm a Stephen Fry fan, but I got to say, I think he went out like a bitch. He should have hung in there. Fuck yeah. Come on. That's small group of people can chase you out of one of the most fucking easily used forms of free expression the world has ever known, but he takes.

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       Is him making a joke about a dress? Yeah. And people shitting on him for making a joke, but what? What, what? Why would you even care about the opinion of people who get upset at you for making fun of address in his blog where he was talking about quitting twitter, he did begin by saying, this is not a big deal. I don't know if this is forever. I'm not doing this as a stand. I just feel so much more liberated. Not going there because you're right. He is at the pinnacle of his industry. He was hosting the bloody baptist. I mean that's like posting the Academy Awards in the UK, so he should be big enough to have people sniping at him. If you're hosting the Academy Awards. He's a sniper. Yeah. That's what does this whole thing is. I can understand. His whole thing is marketing. People say they're offended, so he's getting offended by people mocking him for being offended.

Speaker 1:          02:02:27       I'm not sure he's offended. I think he just doesn't want to play that game. Okay. What does that word then? What? Where do we looking for upset board? No upset board and exhausted. I don't believe you write a whole blog because you're bored. I think you're right. A blog because you're upset. He was angry, he was visibly angry or at least appeared to be through his tweets and his reactions to people being upset with him. I'm making fun of that dress. I mean, I just think it's hard sometimes. Who knows what was going on in his life when that was going on. He made that decision as well. It could have been like a down point in him in his life. Emotionally. You might have realized that might be an up point because I think he just got married. He's getting married. He's, you know, he's dating this guy who's like 50 years younger than him or something, so I was getting a lot of us and he's probably, he's probably having a great time.

Speaker 1:          02:03:14       He's like, I don't need this shit anymore. They can don't fuck off. I don't have time for 140 characters pitch. Exactly. But then why does he have time to write about it? Then I have to step away. Why? Why? It's like when someone would notice it and then they'd be like, oh, well we're Stephen Fry. Why isn't he responding to things? It's easy. You just say, Hey, here I am, I'm going. I wouldn't be here for awhile, but what? Why, why? Even if you can't, if you don't care, you're gonna leave. Why even make an announcement? It's like if someone said to you, you know, hey man, I just thought that your jokes you made about rape and the Joe Rogan podcast. We're totally uncalled for, followed,

Speaker 6:          02:03:46       followed through the unfollowed dance. See what I wrote, but I'm pretty sure I read it. I wish the audio podcast listeners could see the Joe Rogan dance that just happened of like halfway between a down syndrome child and then I unfollowed you. I win in

Speaker 1:          02:04:07       a day. This is the national anthem. It's that thing that they do. They just want to get your what, how many people are talking about? I mean one or two or three people got mad at him. No, no, no. I mean, I, I take your point. Sure. Maybe it's a pussy move, but it's his life. He doesn't have to be on twitter if you don't want to be on twitter. The problem is he's so great. Upsets me that he would have that. That reaction too, by the way. I've read the things that people wrote to him. It wasn't really that big of a deal. He made fun of a woman's dress and said it looked like a garbage bag.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       One of his friends. It's kind of funny, but of course people are gonna. React. Here's what. Here's what. Here's what. Here's what he wrote. He said, let us grieve what twitter has become a stalking ground for the sanctimoniously self righteous who loved to second guess to leap to conclusions and be offended. Worse to be offended on behalf of others they don't even know. And then he says, it doesn't matter whether are defending women, men, transgender people, Muslims, humanists. The ghastliness is absolutely the same. Okay. What's a pram? The stroller. Oh, out of a pram as I go. Well, I thought it was like a boat, a pram. That's my. That's what way in the British Cola Cola. Jamie, Google the word Pram. Why don't I think the pram was a type of boat and a pram, Pram. You got a bunch of, uh, what the fuck it had a reset your computer.

Speaker 2:          02:05:29       It's a stroller. I just told you that three times. John, trust me. How do you not trust me? But I wanted him to google boat boat because why do I think? Oh yeah. It says boat. That's one of the. Yeah, it was a boat. It's type of boat. Is it a, is it a, a sort of brand of both small utility, Dinky transom bow rather than a pointed bow? Don't make fun of me Bro. I got knowledge. Deep knowledge about shitty boats, small utility biggies. That's what I knew was like why is he throwing this idea that of a small utility data, but what he said was eloquent. I mean he's, he's dead on about the sanctimonious recreational outrage and also he lives in a country. Remember where you can actually be, be prosecuted for saying things that people find offensive like in the UK.

Speaker 2:          02:06:18       Did you, did you hear about the mealy mouth a tweet this guy. So after the Brussels attack, there was a guy, just a regular dude who tweeted, I confronted a Muslim woman yesterday. I asked her to explain Brussels, she said nothing to do with me. Immediately. Mouth reply that cools the media storm because they were like, well yeah, there were lots of like funny reactions to that. What people will like, you know, I asked an IRA, I've met an Irish person and asked them to explain the IRA. He said nothing to do with me. I'm mainly math reply. Oh, you know, I, I asked a dog why I was bitten by a dog when I was four. He said, woof, mainly math reply. But this guy was arrested. He was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred. Wow. And in the UK, that's what can happen, like in the UK, simply saying that Islam is a problem and or Islamic stupid can get you potentially arrested.

Speaker 2:          02:07:15       Wow. Under blasphemy laws. Look at this. He subsequently expressed concerns for his health, was taken to a nearby hospital. He's probably having a fucking heart attack. Doyle's tweet, which has since been deleted. Read. I confronted a one. Okay. Mealy mouth or par. Wow. That is quite a few offensive things. He was like, in response to people getting angry with him, he was like, oh, so I offended a towel, head, big deal. So you know, he's not maybe the nicest guy in the world, but when you come, when you live in a country. Yeah, when you live in a country with the first amendment, it's pretty fucking crazy that a person can say something, can tweet something like that and then get arrested. So tamid has got some issues to camera. Has issues with comedians. Yup. There was

Speaker 3:          02:07:54       one comedian, I'm in Montreal that made a joke about some kid that was dying and he, the kid survived and all these people had donated money apparently. So he made some joke about, you know, how the fuck is this kid still alive? Something along those lines and I'm just trying to be funny. And he's been fighting it in court and they're trying to put him in jail. And this other kid in Vancouver, the guy who was on stage and some women were heckling and uh, he said something about them being ugly, lesbians and some mean shit to them. He got sued last. I mean, they're heckling at a comedy club and you know what he said, whether it was skillful or not, whether it's, I mean, it's not like someone just yelling something to someone out randomly. This is someone trying to handle a heckler ad libbing in a comedy club with a bunch of drunk people and these hecklers who had been fucking up the show up until the time he got there. So he's trying to wreck them and make them feel bad. They sued him and won unbelievable force comic to pay $15,000 for tirade of ugly words against lesbian patron after appeals falls flat.

Speaker 2:          02:09:09       Like why pay 15,000 comedy show? Because he insulted somebody. Yeah. I got to tell you, I haven't seen anything that bad in Australia, but it is also bad in Australia in terms of like what frustrates me the most is that people from certain ethnic groups or religions, uh, claiming that you can be, you can bless fame. You can, what do you call it? When you defend that, right? You can defame like a religion or ethnicity.

Speaker 3:          02:09:35       Hold on, look at that. Jamie. Scientists say they've developed a second skin you can wear for more than a day to look younger. What? What the fuck, dude, you're going to go out some old lady or old man, whatever, and you're going to think I found the perfect guy. Wow. Get beautiful skin. Smells like an old guy, but

Speaker 2:          02:09:57       the idea sounds like fantasy and invisible film that can be painted on your skin and give it the elasticity of youth bags under the eyes and finish and seconds wrinkles disappear and this is from the national post, which is an actual publication. This isn't bullshit. Hundred 70 people have tried it under eye bags. No reported an irritation or reactions. Whoa.

Speaker 3:          02:10:17       Bags are just to start. You can soak the film was sunscreen and protect yourself without worrying about sweat or water washing it away. The researchers say they expect it can be used to treat Eczema, psoriasis and other skin conditions by covering dry, itchy patches with a film that moisturizes and soothes. Whoa, I'm going to get me some of that, but you know, that's one of those weird things where I would have never even thought that someone would come up with this idea. It's clever though, right? It's amazing. They developed a two step process. A polymer, a clear liquid is applied it. It's chains are not very strong though, so the next step is applying a product that links them together. By modifying the chemistry of the chains. The researchers can alter the properties of the second skin depending on how it will be used, making it more or less permeable. For example, a more permeable second skin might be used for under eye bags were a less permeable one might hold a medication in place. It can be removed with a solution that dissolves the Palmer. Whoa. We're plastic people. The love of Jesus Christ. Well as if the fucking Kardashians more on plastic enough, they're going to have plastic faces.

Speaker 2:          02:11:22       By the time it is going to look 20 again, by the time I need to get botox or any kind of facial surgery, I'm not going to need it anymore. There you go. Spray some polymer on my face to a lag by you. You make lemonade. Exactly. I see something and you go, this is a positive on this. Fuck. Having plastic people. I wonder if they feel like rubbers though. Like you know like he touched people. It feels good like skin touching skin. I wonder if all the sudden it's like touching a rubber. Well especially if you're wearing it right? Like if someone caresses your, your cheek. Does it just feel like why don't worry about what they feel like. Because your hands I'm assuming won't be covered by this shit. No, you wouldn't cover the. Unless you really. Unless you're like my fingertips give away my age.

Speaker 2:          02:12:02       I don't like when I take baths in my skin. Prunes so he can do something. A really hot bath and then spray some polar moment. My fingertips. What the fuck man. That's great. We're going to cover ourselves with rubber. We're gonna. See, I mean the fact that we've got enough money to be thinking about this. Like coming back to the question about like poaching elephants in Africa or Megan to the Mumbai slum. Like what the fuck is the world on about when you talk about the inequality between Beverly Hills and Baltimore, what about the inequality between people who are inventing polymers so that we can spray them on our bet, our eye bags so that we look a little bit less old at the same time as there are people living on a penny a day in Mumbai? Yes. And Naughty. Like if you were an alien and came down to the earth right now, you'd be like, what are these guys doing? They got plenty to go around. They got tons of shit.

Speaker 3:          02:12:48       That's a super good point. And there's something that I was reading about today about a type of polymer that they've used on. Um, God, what was it on? It was on certain, you know, let me find the history here. It was on certain, um, certain types of, uh, it's like a plastic that could spray on things and when they spray this shit on things it um, it actually, uh, you could, you could throw like cinder blocks off of buildings and shit because of it.

Speaker 2:          02:13:19       Wait in the cinder block is okay or. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The cinder block stays together. It's fucking madness pool. It's really weird. Let me guess. The military developed. It sounds like something like that probably let

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       me find this stuff because it's some shit that they spray on things and they're using an uncertain automobiles.

Speaker 1:          02:13:40       Uh, it's like, hold on, let me find it real quick. It's, um, in the meantime, you can open your podcast app and subscribe to the way the people live. There you go, hold on one line and you can get more delightful conversations with the likes of myself. It's called finance.

Speaker 3:          02:13:55       Thanks Jamie. Google line x polymer coating because this stuff, they put it on, um, on plates and they throw it off a buildings like, look, they threw this does on the history channel. They threw these cinderblocks off of, uh, off of a building and then they cover the cinder block with paint and then they throw the same cinderblock, same size cinder block off a building that's covered in this protective coating. And watch what happens. It just found sentences. Now they did it with eggs, man, they did it with plates, they did it with eggs. And then on top of that, they did it with plastic cups where they had a sumo wrestler stand on plastic cups, like look at the egg. So they're spraying the egg. And by the way this is like less than a quarter inch coating that they put on these eggs. Boom, bounces off the ground. Wow. This is crazy shit. But look at the cups is the really weird stuff. They took this gigantic sumo wrestler and they had him stand on these plastic cups. Of course he crushes them. Then they take the same kind of cup and they cover it with this line x shit. Go Way, way back. Wait, wait. There's a sumo wrestler dude you can see easily. Obviously you can just a little sippy cup.

Speaker 1:          02:15:07       It's a red like Red Cup from a frat party or something. Go way further ahead. Jamie [inaudible]. He crushes you, but go away for it. No Watch. Look at this. He's standing on to read like be a cops and they're not much big. You look, they're not much bigger. It's not like daily became super thick because of this stuff. So this must just. What does it do? I guess it just disperses the energy of the. I don't know, the full all across the. The product. I don't know man. It's some super fucking polymer. I mean, what would you use it for? You just use it to make everything strong I guess. Yeah. I guess our cover your fucking whole body with bro become iron man. Become like a thing from fantastic for, you know? Yeah. Put a little bit of a. put the old, put the anti aging polymer on first.

Speaker 1:          02:15:51       Then put this shit on jumping off a building and bounce. Dude. That's what I'm looking at. Just run right through walls. Shit you recommend when you're going to do that. I think in 100 years from now, science and technology will have achieved results that are unfathomable. Yeah. I think we are just in the infancy. I mean go back to 1916. People lived like fucking cave people there. There were barely human monkeys. Yeah. And think about what, what we're experiencing now in 2016 now imagine what 2000, 116 is going to be like. Well also think about it. Think about if we can ever do like what Ray Kurzweil wants us to do and be able to unite like artificial intelligence with our our intelligence. I think it's inevitable. If that happens, then that's going to be a big game changer. That all of the physiological things that we've been able to do in terms of the evolution since the industrial revolution where it's going to be like an information revolution and we're going to become cosmic gods in some sort of a weird way.

Speaker 1:          02:16:48       I think it's inevitable because I just think it. As long as we don't blow ourselves up or get hit by a meteor or a supervolcano wipes out the planet, I think it's inevitable. We're going to continue. Not We, not you and I. We're not going to do shit. Where's it going to be talking? Speak for yourself. Don't be the first one. We're just going to be talking, but there's gonna be other people out there that are really fucking smart. They're going to come together with some other really smart people and they're going to figure out some amazing things and we were just watching it that I'd love to make skin shit when we. When people wonder about why we haven't found extraterrestrial civilizations yet and we haven't heard their radio waves. I'm so hopeful that the reason is that like we just evolve out of that.

Speaker 1:          02:17:27       We've only had them for less than 100 years. Right, and we don't have been pumping them out for Henri is maybe a. maybe we're just about to find something else and we'll realize that the universe is actually teeming with all these conversations between different civilizations that we are just completely oblivious to and they don't care about reaching out to us because we're just little ants on a. on a little rock floating around, a star on an outer spiral arm of an insignificant galaxy called Milky Way and they're like, some of these guys will grow up and they'll join the conversation when they're ready. It's probably exactly what's going on. Or it gets to the point where it's no longer necessary because intelligence and artificial intelligence become exactly the same thing and we create a different kind of life with technology in our pursuit. Like this fucking this ibm machine that's beating people that go game, you know, killing chess champions at their fucking preferred game that one day they're going to, it's going to reach some sort of a state where we have to accept it as a life form and it has rights because it has a conception of itself.

Speaker 1:          02:18:28       Can it go in any bathroom at once he comes to computers walking to the bathroom. I was talking to someone who is, who was saying that, uh, when we can grow artificial meat because they're working on artificial meat in a lab. And then will it be the case that the only ethical meat to eight, uh, that isn't artificial would be human mate because we're the only people capable of giving informed consent to have ourselves be eaten by ourselves. It would be, maybe we can take all these fat people and we could like suck body meet off of them. They'd be like, I really wish I was thinner when you go to a place and with no scars, with 30 percent of your body weight polymer that I can spray on you, which just extract some of your, uh, your fat and calories and into a smoothie for me to sell it as protein bars that you mentioned, the Gauguin, the computer that, that Bates people that go. The thing that I find really fascinating about that is the computer that Bates people at chess is basically just a brute number cruncher, right? So

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       deep blue and deep blue won whatever was it Kasparov. Um, what that basically does is just looks at all the different possible outcomes that you might be about to play and then rapidly calculates the probability that any particular move is going to yield a good result. Right? We can all imagine how that, how that functions. It's basically just lots and lots of numbers, but go is so complicated. There are so many different options at any particular point in the game that no computer can even remotely and probably ever will be able to calculate the game itself. The way that the chess computer does there. There are more options I think in a game of go then there are like atoms in the universe at some crazy stat like that. So what the go compete, I know went fuck that.

Speaker 2:          02:20:16       It's the power of exponential. Right? So like if there's, if there are two options and then those two options each lead to another two options which include to another two options which actually not have the two options very quickly you get up to numbers that are those thought experiments of how many times would you have to fold a piece of paper for it to reach the moon and it's only like 30 or 40 times or something ridiculous like that because it's doubling all the time. Can you look that up Jamie? How many times do you need to fold a piece of paper for tuition to the moon? But anyway, so the point about the go computer is it doesn't crunch numbers, it learns from other go games, so they load into it all of the go game like thousands or millions of games that have happened and it then looks at all of those games and tries to find patterns between the way the, the, the particular moves that humans have done in past games and then uses its own intuition to run billions of possible games in its own head.

Speaker 2:          02:21:12       And it gradually learns from its own mistakes. So it's not just a computer, it's not just like a gigantic calculator like the chess computer is, is a form of artificial intelligence in that it is making calculations. I mean obviously it doesn't know anything we don't think but it. But for me it's really super exciting because I do think that it's really interesting to ask the cheering test question of like when is the computer actually self aware? And this is the beginning glimmers of that. I think within our lifetime there will be computers that it's just meaningless to say they're not self aware because they claimed to be self aware. They they behave as if they're self aware, they tell us that they feel pain, they tell us that they have an interest in their own, continued existence in a way that's so authentic and that learns that to say that they're not self aware, but like a chimp is would be meaningless. Do you think that they're going to say start

Speaker 3:          02:22:00       by just trolling people on twitter with like fake intelligence, like imagine this guy that you're arguing with on twitter. He to be a person and they just realize what, what riles people up with spins their gears and they just start sending these troll twitter things out and they just started having debates with people like literally having debates and breaking people down and then being passive aggressive, being shitty, being inquisitive. Like they try a bunch of different approaches and they treat it the same way. They treat go games. They just learned behavior

Speaker 2:          02:22:33       patterns. That would be the worst people in the world and if they learned their behavior patterns off the way that we communicate on social media,

Speaker 3:          02:22:41       you'd just be creating a monster. Well, it makes you wonder. I mean, if go games are that complicated, yet they're able to master that. What about human personality? What do we do? We kid ourselves in that we're so complex and amazing that nothing could copy us mean what if some fucking computer figures out a way to bypass personality? Personality is overrated. We figured out a way to make the perfect personality. This is the formula. Run with it. Everyone's going to love you.

Speaker 2:          02:23:08       Did you see that movie about I'm a x Mokena. See that? Amazing. No, that's Kinda the conceit of that. Right? So there's this sort of the billionaire kind of leader, the Mark Zuckerberg type in that the way that he builds the artificial intelligence is by hoovering up all of the. All of your social media information from his facebook style thing, and I think you're right, that that could be one way of creating an artificial intelligence to collect all of the communal inputs that we're putting in every single day on social media. One hundred percent, 100 percent possible to learn those patterns. Yeah. Jamie, how many, how many times? I was just gonna say there's a specific episode of that show, Black Mirror I've been trying to tell you about that deals with this exact topic where there's some sort of like android created thing and they take this guy, this whole social media presence and recruit. That's what his new being. He died. I don't want to ruin all of the. Yeah, it's Donald. Yeah. Same Guy. The actor that's in next Maki now, so it's a little bit. Which guy? The millionaire guy. No, the guy fucked over. Yeah, he's a good actor. I gotta get Outta here, man. I'm sorry. We're out of time. Anytime time flew by. Does it always does. Always. Does so much fun. Yeah. No, I love it when you're back in town. A denier, but I'll give you a Holler at me.

Speaker 3:          02:24:27       My friends will be back tomorrow way that people live and just apps on twitter. We the people live. Just to pull myself out yet further. Yeah, it up, baby. Thanks man. Tomorrow we'll be back with Alex grey. A famed visionary artists should be a goddamn blast. See, then you fucks.
