Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:00:03       the Joe Rogan experience your podcast. First of all, thanks for doing this. I found out about you several years back. I had heard something about toxoplasmosis. Sandra and I had seen a speech that you'd given on it where you were talking about how many people have been infected by this campaign. I've had cats my whole life and I even had feral cats and I've always wondered like I should probably get tested and I'm worried about the result. Well, it was just fascinating to me that literally, I mean, what is the number that you estimate in Americans alone that might have been infected?

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       It's on the order of, well, I'm not sure what the Americans, but worldwide it's something like 50 percent of humans is the best guess. Fifty percent of humans wrote one thing on that scale.

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       Have for people they never heard of this. Would you mind explaining what this parasite is and how it affects rats and cats and then people?

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       Okay, totally bizarre. So it's this, this protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma Gondii, and it's got one of these weird parasitic lifestyles. The only place on earth where it could reproduce sexually is in the god of a cat. I don't know why there are people who know this, but so it reproduces their comes out in the cat feces, feces or eaten by rodents and now talks. Those evolutionary challenge is to get that road and it into a cat stomach. So what talkshow has evolved is this ability. It's slowly migrates to the brain of rodents and basically wipes out the innate fear that rodents have of cat. Smells like you take a lab rat who's been like the descendant of lab rats for like a thousand years, have never seen a cat and put like a Little Puddle of Cat pee in its cage and the rent's going to go on the other side of the case. Just hardwired instinctual aversion to cat pheromones and then put toxin in a rat and it loses that aversion and in fact it was sunset of rat. They liked the smell so out in the natural setting that you now go and approach a cat and certainly rutins inside the cat's stomach and toxin was completed its lifecycle.

Speaker 2:          00:02:24       Well, I had heard that it was a, so it's a subset of rats that, that actually are gravitated towards it because I've heard it actually rewires them sexually.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       Yes. That, that's actually work that we did in my lab, that it basically crosses some of the circuitry in the brain, the hypothalamus, so that cat pheromones that used to be activating every alarm circuit in Europe, like Olympic system, and these rodents now instead sort of taps into sexual arousal pathways. And in male rats when they smelled cat pheromones, they increase testosterone production. Um, so talk, so has just figured out the most brilliant way of doing it. It makes cat pee, smell sexy.

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       Do. Is there any understanding at all of the mechanism of how a parasite can figure out how to rewire an animals sexual reward system? The fear of predators? Like how does that work?

Speaker 1:          00:03:22       Well, that's something my lab spent a bunch of years on. I'm trying to figure out, when you look at some of these parasites, this taps into this whole world of behavioral manipulation of hosts by parasites. And turns out they've evolved unbelievably brilliant mechanisms for manipulating hosts for their own benefit. I mean, think about it. You get rabies, you hit a rabid dog. And what that's about is a virus that has affected the nervous system of that dog so that it's now rabbit and more likely to bite somebody with viral particles in it, saliva, which ad now passes onto the next individual like you take 10,000 neuroscientists and stick them in a convention on the neurobiology of aggression. And rabies knows more about the neuro watering of aggression than we do and talk. So knows quotation marks, uh, something about fear and aversion and the neurobiology of attraction.

Speaker 1:          00:04:25       Part of what it seems to involve his toxo somewhere along the way has picked up a gene that is pertinent to the dopamine system in mammals. Dopa Munis, this neurotransmitter, it's about pleasure. Um, there is no protozoan parasite for building years that's had any use for this stuff, except it's part of how toxo seems to be manipulating the reward system in rodents. And then couple of years ago there's paper showing that in chimpanzees toxo makes you less afraid of the smell of leopards. So this appears to be a parasite that just has evolved like this spectacular insight into fear circuitry and attraction circuitry and it's all for its own benefit to wind up in a casket.

Speaker 2:          00:05:15       So it's specifically cats, like do the chimpanzees still have aversions to snakes and other things that can kill them?

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       Yep. Yeah. And at one point in my lab was full of like all cat key and wolf pen because actually like accompany you could buy urine from um, I don't know why anyone would want it except for us. Um, but they, so urine from actually what they use it for is you can go spritz it around your garden to scare the deer away. You have stuff. So there's, I don't know where they get the urine from, but it's like from certified and all of that. Um, and yeah, it's remarkably specific. So like other, have they

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       ever done tests where they chest, like wolf urine or anything like that around chimps? Do they have any aversion to that? Um, as far as I know, the chimps study,

Speaker 1:          00:06:05       he's only been with big cafeteria, but the rubin studies exactly that, showing it's a fair specificity. The rodents lose a little bit of their general skittishness a, they get a little bit disinhibited behaviorally. So just in general, they're out more and more exploratory, more likely to get eaten. But the most selective lasering effect is they're not scared anymore of cat pheromones.

Speaker 2:          00:06:31       Now, what's fascinating to me is that I've also read that, um, there was a disproportionate amount of successful soccer teams that are in countries with high rates of infestation of Toxoplasma. Okay, that one's good.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       That one's new to me, but that, that sounds like exactly the sort of epidemiological studies that are popping up about humans, right? So worry about humans. Um, there's two branches of interesting stuff with toxin when humans. One is a literature that's been around for quite some time showing that talkshow seems to increase the risk of schizophrenia. There's a higher rate of schizophrenia, of individuals who have antibodies against toxo. In other words, sometime in the past and their body was dealing with it. Um, who had cats growing up, whose mother had cats during pregnancy, and like anybody who gets pregnant knows you immediately get all anxious about cat litter boxes because of possibility of toxoplasmosis. It can attack the field, nervous system, do all sorts of damage, and a subtle version of it seems to be a sleeper effect of increasing the risk of schizophrenia. Um, the other realm is toxo infected humans get subtle changes in personality, neuropsychology, sort of neuropsychological profiles.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       They get a little bit disinhibited if you're talk, so infected, your more likely to die in a car accident involving reckless speeding. If you're talking to infected and clinically depressed for the same severity of depression, you're more likely to impulsively kill yourself. Now the words talks. Who's doing something kind of similar? If you're a rat, one of the hardest wired, scary things in the universe out there as the smell of the cat. If you are human, it's hurdling through space really fast and jumping out of windows. And toxo seems to blunt a lot of those effects there

Speaker 2:          00:08:39       in this. Um, the, the speech that I saw you give, you were talking about your time working in a hospital and that there was a disproportionate amount of motorcycle victims. This was actually

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       something I heard from a clinician, a, a, uh, no hold sort of parasitology infectious disease doctor who sort of, when I was first telling him about this sort of the merchant toxic story, he had like one of these bolts of memory saying, my God, I remember back when I was a resident, there is this old doctor saying, you know, if you're ever harvesting organs from an accident victim, I don't know why. I don't know why, but if it's from somebody who was in a motorcycle accident, make sure you check to see if they have toxoplasmosis. I don't know why that there's a high rate of that that you find in Oregon's from people who were killed driving motorcycles recklessly. Totally anecdotal and equals one kind of thing. But nonetheless, this, this was a guy who like studies, infectious disease and toxoplasmosis and had not heard about sort of the behavioral findings before and that, uh, out of the recesses of his memory.

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       So what initially seemed like, okay, this is a parasite that's very selectively develop this lifecycle between cat stomachs and rodent brains and completing its lifecycle and weird when it gets into humans that have some behavioral effects. Also, this just kind of evolutionary spill over, but then you see if it's doing something similar between chimps and leopards suggesting that that lifecycle manipulation has been selected for in primates as well. Very strange. It's very strange and for me the strangest thing is the certainty with which there's a zillion viruses and bacteria and God knows what else out there that manipulate host behavior in ways we just haven't figured out yet or we just have this right. We haven't discovered that particular one. What does it do to women of a similar fact seems to have less severe effects on neuropsychological profiles of women. Again, the literature on this is pretty scanty and humans, but it seems to have some similar effects but not as extreme.

Speaker 1:          00:11:01       However, the story now gets a little bit more complicated and this is actually this fabulous scientist entree vs a WHO's my postdoc, who's now a professor in Singapore who's continued to study this. Okay, so normally one of the things animals have evolved to be really good at is picking up signals that somebody else's unhealthy, like a potential mate is unhealthy. There's sickness behavior, there's very olfactory cues. If you're a rodent, makes perfect sense. The last thing you want to do is to be meeting with somebody who's like Branson infectious, um, and rodent equivalence of stds. So normally sick animals, parasite infected animals and such are detected by other rodents and avoided toxo does something different. You get a so infected male and now he smells more attractive to female rodents and when mating talks and gets into the sperm and can be transmitted to the female.

Speaker 1:          00:12:08       So suddenly we've got a different story here. We started off with the parasites to rework. Toxo was just ruthlessly exploiting the poor rodents for its own reproductive benefit and its own evolutionary selfish gene wellbeing. The now instead, it's got elements of instead of parasitism symbiosis. So you're male rat infested with toxo downside, you're more likely to get eaten by a cat upside, you're more likely to pass on copies of your genes by the increased sexual selection. So it might be in fact more of a balance, the symbiotic relationship between male rats and talk. So you know, more research is needed, blah blah. It's just like cool sort of biology out there.

Speaker 2:          00:12:58       It's crazy. And is it, is it transferred sexually with men and women too, as well as with rats? I don't know. I don't think it's been looked at. Wow. That seems like something I would want to look at right away. What about organ donors?

Speaker 1:          00:13:13       Um, other than again, pure anecdotal ism that one elderly dock somewhere back when saying watch it when you're getting organized from like people killed in motorcycle accidents. Beyond that, I don't know. I mean people are looking at it, I'm sure even tasks like say if you got to liver and you know, like you needed a liver transplant, would suspect they do. And sort of in the clinical world of people who worry about Toxo toxo pregnancy, scary alarms going off. Toxo, anything else after an acute period of infection, you have a latent toxoplasma infection. In other words, the agreed upon sort of notion there is toxo has called latent. It's formed sort of these cysts that are in dirt and you've got nothing to worry about that, but the whole notion that meanwhile up in the nervous system, there's effects happening there. You know, infectious disease people are thinking about inflammation outside in the body. There are for them, chronic toxic infection is not something you worry about a whole lot, but if it's I'm having behavioral effects up there in the nervous system, maybe it is something to worry about.

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       Well, it's just, it's to me it's unfathomable how this little thing figures out how to hijack a whole a whole body, whole biological system and work it to its own desires. It's very. It's very hard for me to grasp. Well, if you think of it in terms of, I dunno, talk so has had

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       like 100,000 more generations to evolve its ways of exploiting mammals. Mammals have had ways of fighting it off. What's most remarkable is turns out this is like a whole world of parasites that do bizarre, manipulative things to their host. Most of it's not in the realm of mammals. Instead there's like some parasitic something or other that gets into barnacles and takes over their reproductive system so that the barnacle digs a hole for them. Them not the barnacle, but the parasite to lay eggs into theirs. You know,

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       the aquatic worms that infects the grasshopper makes a commit suicide. Exactly. That one's a bizarre, bizarre. There's this wasp that gets into cockroaches and takes him out to see you. I'm fascinated by parents sites. It'd be beyond that. It's just, it's so confusing to me how something. I mean, obviously you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of generations for it to get to this, this current state, but like how something evolves to be so effective. Yeah. It's just, it's so confusing.

Speaker 1:          00:16:03       It's remarkable. Um, you know, just to flip to the other end of the spectrum in terms of what like coevolution between two different species can be like over the last 20,000 years. Look at what we've done. We've taken wolves and turned them into these creatures. We put Halloween costumes on and like finding a couple of years ago which like floored make this hormone oxytocin, which is totally trendy. Oxytocin is completely cool. Mother infant bonding is mediated by oxytocin pair bonding in monogamous species. Oxytocin makes you more trusting and expressive and generous and economic games and oxytocin has all these pro social effects within a species, but then it turns out that this hormone that has spent the last, I I know 100 million years, having mothers and infants connect to each other emotionally. When you and your beloved dog sit there and stare into each other's eyes, you secrete oxytocin and if you pump up oxytocin levels and your dog, it will stare at you longer and you will stare longer back more oxytocin.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       This is like an ancient ancient hormone having to do with mother infant bonding and in 20,000 years, which is like a blink of an eye, evolutionarily suddenly we're doing this weird oxytocin tango thing than other species and other species too. We feed and take care of and they like manipulate as wildly and to like get in like good dessert, treat bones and stuff like that. And they in turn do all sorts of wonderful stuff for our self esteem because they like lick us unconditionally. And where'd that come from? Just 20,000 years and you've like hijack this ancient neuroendocrinology about like parental behavior and now it's got to do with this weird symbiotic thing we involve as worked out somewhere back going, what does it have any effect on friendship, like a human being staring at each other. Did that event anybody ever tested that? I would assume people have looked at that it, for example, it strengthens monogamous bonds and there's literature by now looking at oxytocin has its effects by binding to an oxytocin receptor.

Speaker 1:          00:18:34       There's a gene for the oxytocin receptor comes into number of variants and if you have one particular variant that's associated with oxytocin and having less effective women whom in your nervous system that's associated with less stable relationships. Um, so you know, none of this stuff is deterministic. Your, your, your sex life and your romantic life is not being determined by this one gene, like nothing remotely resembling that, but that's just part of the mix in there. I was just wonder if that makes, applies to like protonic friendships, like male bonding and stuff. I wonder if there's like when guys are out having a good time, if they're also getting a good juice of oxytocin might guess is when you have your basic like pathetic male associate associativity, which is like you talk about sports for five minutes with some guy and as a result you're willing to give up your life for him because like you know, this is male male, Bonnie.

Speaker 1:          00:19:30       I bet that's got something to do with oxytocin. Yeah. Made. It only makes sense. I mean, how many of these different factors are there in manipulating human behavior? I mean this is essentially your specialty, right? Yeah. Okay, so switching over to this part of the brain, the frontal cortex, which is just like the coolest part of the brand. It's the most recently evolved. We've got more of it or it's more complicated than us than any other species. What is the frontal cortex do? It makes you do the harder thing when it's the right thing to do. Selfcontrol, longterm planning, gratification, postponement, emotional regulation, all this sort of stuff. And Frontal Cortex, it's function is totally amazing how it does this. Okay, so another way of stating that is over and over in life, we come to splits in the road where we've got temptations and we've got impulses and we've got, yeah, go for it right now.

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       You know you want it. And the frontal cortex is critical at that juncture as to whether we like do the inane, impulsive, self indulgent thing that we may perhaps regret for the rest of our lives. Or if you tough it out and do the right and like what your frontal cortex does a critical junctures, like one of the most consequential pieces in neurobiology. We've got. So you asked what kind of things affect how well your frontal cortex is working in that one second where you have to decide if that person is holding a cell phone or a handgun and you pull a trigger or in that one second where you decide to you take this thing and run or those temptations get resisted, and so what sort of biological things affect what your frontal cortex is doing, how hungry you are, if you're hypoglycemic, how tired you are.

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       If you're in pain, all of those make the frontal cortex work not as well if you're a male, what your testosterone levels are at the time, no surprise testosterone makes your frontal cortex all sluggish and stupid, but your stress hormone levels were if you've been traumatized over the previous five months because sustained stress will atrophy. The frontal cortex. Uh, wait, what versions of the number of genes you've got, how much stress hormones you were exposed to from your mother when you were a fetus? How must lead there was in the water when you were a kid, if your ancestors were nomadic pastoralists and developed a culture of honor, what your nutritional status was when you were a kid and everything in between. All of this coming down to Whoa, there's just biological forces shaping what we're doing to an incredible extended. It's the exact same story about any other part of the brain, but this is just like one of the most dramatic ones.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       Oh, a moment of agency and free will and volition. Whether or not I'm going to be to resist this temptation or not by age five, for example, the kids socioeconomic status is already a predictor of how much frontal development there is in this part of the brain. Because if you've been foolish enough in this country to choose the wrong parents to get born into there and you're being raised in poverty on the average, your stress hormone levels are higher and as a result of that, on the average, your frontal cortex is fender and not developing this fast and on the average. Already at age five, you're not as good as on average. At the hold out, relieve me. You're going to be glad you held out for this longterm reward thing. Wow. Now is toxo have an effect on the frontal cortex? I'm almost certainly that's a hot area of research.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       Um, we were originally hoping to see that. Oh, talks who was just going to laser in on just some key parts of the brain that are absolutely essential to this behavioral effect. Seems to wind a more widespread. So that was sort of makes it a tougher story, but in some ways sort of impulsive behavior is either due to a stronger biology of impulsiveness, which has much to do with Olympic system. The image or a weaker biology of. Hold on a second. Are you sure? This is such a great idea. The hold on a second is this. Such a great idea is the realm of the frontal Cortex, so that could very readily be half of the equation right there.

Speaker 2:          00:23:59       Wow. Now the frontal cortex is not fully online until you're what? Twenty, 25. It's like, it's boggling thing. So you just live your life like an ape until you're. I mean, you're deep into your adulthood, you're responsible for yourself for over seven years and you're. Yep.

Speaker 1:          00:24:18       Which has some like stupefying implications and not just for explaining why your freshman roommate was the week that he was.

Speaker 2:          00:24:27       Is it uniform with male women? Yeah. I'm female development and maturation of the frontal cortex configures faster of course, and the males of course, but nonetheless, it's this very delayed maturation that has to do with, or you're talking about with testosterone impeding it, um, seems to be a different mechanism there, but just in general, so brain. So he wants it says that testosterone impedes it and then there's something that's as well. Sure does not help, but it's this completely.

Speaker 1:          00:24:59       Well, it's basically the explanation for why adolescents are adolescent. They have a brain that's going full blast, especially the dopamine system with reward and sensation seeking and novelty seeking anticipation and a frontal cortex that's like half baked at that point and is not very good at controlling impulses. That's why adolescents are the way they are. So to sort of really interesting implications with that. First one is sort of in the kind of big picture legal implications realm. This fact that the frontal cortex is not fully developed until you're in your mid twenties was implicitly the main driving force around the supreme court some years ago saying you can't execute somebody for a crime they did before age 18 and you can't put them behind bars for the rest of life without a chance of parole because their frontal cortex isn't quite there yet. Of course, the flaw with that thinking is the presumption that magically on the very morning of your 18th birthday, you suddenly have a spanking new frontal cortex that like as a memorized all those Sunday morning sermons and can get you to do the right thing, but at least the courts have implicitly recognized that brain maturation, parentheses, frontal cortex is such that adolescent impulse control is not what you see in adults.

Speaker 1:          00:26:26       It has to be judged differently. The other issue that sort of fascinates me on a neuro biological level, you know, most of your cortex is doing just fine by the time you're three, four, five years old, and there's the frontal cortex taking another 20 years to get there. So you say, so is the frontal cortex just a tougher construction project then the rest of the brain, does it have like fancy type neurons you don't see elsewhere that take amazing wiring or like unique neuro transmitters? Like what is it just like a tougher construction project? Is that why you get the delay and you look closely and. No, it's not. It's not implicitly a tougher project. You don't get delayed from maturation because it's so hard to wire up. You get the delay because we've been selected to have the delay. You want a frontal cortex that spends a long, long time and learning.

Speaker 1:          00:27:24       Okay. How come? Because by definition, if this is the last part of the brain to wire up, it's the part of the brain that's most sculpted by experience and environment and least constrained by genes, and this is the part of the brain that does social appropriate context learning and that's incredibly tough stuff like every society, every culture on earth. Do you think about it? Every culture on earth celebrates some types of murder and is horrified and punishes other types. Song get metals, some get damnation, some get like simply that one. Every culture has some sort of strictures against lying. Yet in some circumstances I expect you to have socially appropriate line in certain circumstances of protection or so on, and every culture does this differently. Every culture has culture specific mores and situational ethics and things like and that's like fancy, complicated stuff that takes a long time to learn.

Speaker 1:          00:28:29       That's what you're doing is an adolescent. As a young adult, you're learning all the subtleties of appropriate behavior that's here from the cortex. Learning not just how to get you to do the right thing, that there is a harder thing to do, but all of those complexities of what actually counts as the right thing and all of the things that make us human above all the other primates above all others because we're the species that in some cultures can say, we strongly believe in monogamy and build our theologies around that. Yet at the same time have incredibly high rates of people failing to remain monogamous. You have condemned that. We have cultures where like you're not supposed to lie yet. At some point you have to learn like, okay, it's okay to lie in a circumstance of so tell us, are you harboring those refugees in your attic?

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       No, no, of course not. Situational ethics like that. It takes a very strong frontal cortex to keep you for lying and certain tempting circumstances, but once you've decided you're going to lie, it takes it from a strong frontal cortex to do it right, to do it effectively because you got to regulate your voice and your facial expressions and where you're all his are looking. Whoa, so this is a part of the brain that's got to incorporate your society's rules as to when it's okay to lie and in fact the sort of thing that we view as heroic, but when it's not okay to lie, but once you decide you're going to lie how to do it effectively. This is like complicated neurobiology. It can't just come with a genetic program of wires it up. It's got to be totally sculpted body and learning all those subtleties. Wow, and

Speaker 2:          00:30:18       is there another animal other than humans that does delay? Reward?

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       Yeah, I'm mean the dopamine system, the reward system, the interactions with the frontal cortex. It's happening in a rodent. Like rodents could learn to master, okay, if I press this lever once, I get one reward, but if I do to lever press, if I work twice as hard to get three rewards, Whoa, that's the way to go. It could master that, monkeys can master that, but it's just implicitly a different thing. Like a monkey could do a delayed gratification task where it's got to wait a couple of minutes for the reward and it's the exact same neurobiology evolve as us doing delayed gratification, except we do delayed gratification, like you study hard to get a good sat score to get into a good college, to get into a good Grad school, to get a good job to get into the nursing home, have your choice of delayed gratification. That takes 60 years depending on your theology. We do delayed gratification where the rewards not gonna come supposedly until the afterlife. So like, yeah, a monkey can have it's frontal cortex, do delayed gratification for it. Wow. On a scale of the minutes. And we'd go and we'd like to do it for 70 years. It's, we're just in a different league in that regard.

Speaker 2:          00:31:39       Wow. So, uh, essentially maybe even some religious rules are some ethical guidelines that we follow. Could almost be like a scaffolding for the frontal quarter

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       techs to absolutely the rule of what counts as the right thing and what counts is the harder thing is very, very culture specific. And that's a tough neurobiological job to master.

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       Do we have any idea when this was do you said this is the most recent thing developed and humans are the most recent. We understand. Well, it's the,

Speaker 1:          00:32:11       it's the most recently evolved part of the brain, which is to say like lizards or texts I'm not much to write home about, but they've got like primitive cortex. It's not who you get to mammals that you start getting fancier cortex that does more abstract stuff and it's not true. You get to mammals that you start seeing the firsthand. So frontal cortex. So you know, recently evolved the last 50 to 100 years. So in other words, the frontal cortex is like spanking new and it's not until you get the primates that gave it a big frontal cortex and it's particularly large and apes and that proportionately, it's particularly larger complexity wired in us.

Speaker 2:          00:32:54       No, I know you spend a lot of time studying baboons. And I listened to that Radiolab podcast that you did, where this Bob Boone, did you call it a troop baboon troop that, uh, was next to the place that was dumping human ways or human garbage and that these baboons became accustomed to eating this human garbage and the unprecedented change in their behavior when the male is the dominant males got sick from tuberculosis.

Speaker 1:          00:33:22       Yep. Okay. So as you said, dive, I've been studying baboons. Are you study them by the way? Like how does that work? What do you do? Oh, it's been 33 summers I spent out there going back to a single every year. Um, it, it ended about eight years ago, but it had been essentially 33 street summers of like you go back to the same animals and you'd camp under the same tree and this isn't a national park in east Africa and you go back to the same animals. And sort of the particular area I've focused my work on over the years is stress and health and what stress does to the brain and, and with the baboons, it was trying to make sense of what does your social rank and your personality and your patterns of social affiliation have to do with which baboons have the cholesterol levels, which baboons have the high blood pressure, who's healthy, who's not.

Speaker 1:          00:34:19       Um, so these are animals where you go to your basic Jane Goodall scene of just like watching them endlessly and knowing all about their personal lives. And in addition, I would dart anesthetize the baboons using a blowgun system which was totally fun to do, but anesthetize them and when they're down to basically the same clinical workup. So you would do on a human sort of, okay, as these guys immune system working this year, how has it or you know, just working that. The last time I was out I had a portable electric cardiogram machine for looking at cardiovascular, cardiac function and these guys. So you keep them there for a day, you do various tests and then. Yeah, let him go back to their bodies and then you have a sense of how is their bodily function, their health or diseases. They're stress physiology, uh, related to aspects of behavior for the first 10 years out there.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       I thought when I had learned was if you want to be a healthy baboons with a minimal number of stress related diseases and you get a choice in the matter, you want to be high ranking. Um, took me about 25 years and almost certainly that had to do with my having to grow up a little bit on my own, uh, to realize that there's much more interesting stuff going on. If you got a choice between being a high ranking by wound or a bad thing with a lot of staple affiliative relationships translated into English. Friends, friends are gonna be even better for your health. I'm like, that's even more protective. How often do you sit and groom with somebody else? How often you're sitting in contact? How often are you playing with infants? Turns out that's much more of a buffer for good health and simply what your dominance rank is.

Speaker 2:          00:36:05       So these baboons, they started eating food from a resort and it changed their behavior to the point where they were no longer getting up very early in foraging. They knew when the food was coming so they just wander down to this dump and then they would basically essentially fight over dominance of the dump and a few strong, powerful males had control over that until they got sick. Great. Yep. So this was the truth.

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       Next word of mine that had this tourist lodge and their territory and thus had a garbage dump that like national parks everywhere have this issue with having a control, wild animals access to. So this garbage dump troop that you said to take him to basically just living in the trees above the dump. Waddled down each morning, just in time for the food, junk leftovers from the lodge to be dumped there. And you know, I did a few studies on this troop. They've got high cholesterol levels. They got borderline diabetes. They put on like subcutaneous fat.

Speaker 2:          00:37:03       They were exactly that tooth decay. Yeah. I

Speaker 1:          00:37:07       got different like parasites in their stomachs. So they're, they're just fine living off of the the good life they're like through now desserts, this tourist lodge and in my troop a couple of kilometers away, I don't know how this works, but in some baboons way, some of my males got word of this feasting going on up there, like they smelled it on a note, but it evolved that in the mornings, about half the males from my troop would pick up and run those couple of kilometers to go punch it out with the guys there to get access to some of this garbage. The key thing was that it wasn't random, which of my baboons would go over there. So you're a guy from like an outside troop and you show up at this garbage dump and there was 80 baboons like feasting there. And you're an outsider. No one from my troop would my dream of going near the garbage unless he's a big aggressive guy.

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       The other thing is morning is when baboons do most of their socializing stuff. They sit around and they groom and they gossip before they go out and they do two days foraging. So if you're willing to pick up and instead spend each morning fighting with strangers over garbage, that means you're not very socially affiliated. So in other words, the males from my troops who were going to eat the garbage were the most aggressive least socially affiliated guys. So this is going on for a couple of years and then your turns to be a tuberculosis outbreak among the baboons over there because there was tubercular meat and in the law and Shannon, a meat inspector who's being bribed and all sorts of par find things and you know, a human gets tuberculosis and they can sit around and write thousand page novel some out for the next 10 years while they slowly waste away.

Speaker 1:          00:38:58       TB kills other primates like over the course of weeks. It's like wildfire in nonhuman primates. So there's an outbreak of TB from the infected meat in this lodge dump. And it basically kills all the baboons and that troop and it kills all of my baboons who had been going over there every morning for food. So now what you have is half the number of males as usual. So you got a two to one female to male ratio, which is pretty atypical for a bag troop and the key thing is the baboons who are left are the nice guys. They're socially affiliated, they're the least aggressive. What's by aggression about you're having a bad day, you find somebody smaller and weaker to take it out on. They weren't dumping on weaker animals, they weren't having displaced aggression and it turned into just to be technical here, like a much nicer troop.

Speaker 1:          00:39:53       They were at much higher rates of grooming, less aggression, more sitting in contact. Male baboons would groom each other, which you don't see male baboons grooming each other in this troop. They would. So in and of itself, that's totally fascinating. So okay, you get rid of 50 percent of the males who the jerks and you have a commune that are going on. What was most interesting, the thing that just flattened me was 10 years later, the troop is still like that. Ten years later, all the males who were there during the TB outbreak, who survived it and ushered in sort of the commune there. They're long gone. So who the new males, male baboons, pick up the puberty, they leave their home troop and they go wandering and joined some adult trip somewhere else and spend the rest of their life. They're heading up the hierarchy. In other words, by 10 years later, all the males in this troop who were still being less aggressive and more socially affiliated, they had all grown up someplace else in some other true and transferred as adolescents into this true and somehow or other learned even though they grew up in the normal, big, bad world out there, somehow they learned, we don't do crap like that here.

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       Cut it out. Wow. And I did a ton of work, sort of seen what that was about. And it takes about six months. Once these new males show up for them, they're less subject to resident males dumping on them because there's less of this displacement aggression. Females who were getting dumped on less by males and thus are much more relaxed, lower stress hormone levels are more willing to be affiliated with them. You some new adolescent male and you show up in your typical baboons. True. And it's like 80 days on the average before some female to you in this troop, it was like three days every because everybody is much more relaxed because no one's being miserable to each other and it turns out you take a jerky adolescent male, because these guys were just as Jerky is any transfer males were to any of the neighboring troops and like you treat them nicer and they kind of calmed down over the next six months and literally what you had, what social anthropologists would be forced to define as cultural transmission non-genetic transmission of a style of behavior from one generation to the next. This was culture being transmitted, a culture of high affiliation and less aggression.

Speaker 2:          00:42:28       And these baboons are essentially living a natural life. They're not getting food from people. Yep. They're just living

Speaker 1:          00:42:33       out in the Serengeti in east Africa and just go about normal life. For me, what was most striking about this is like baboons are as high rates of aggression as you find in any nonhuman primates, a male dominance, highly hierarchical structured societies since the early sixties. They have not just metaphorically, but they've literally been the textbook example of primates evolved for aggression than male dominance and hierarchy and stratification and all it took was one generation of a radically unique circumstance. And you see a pattern of begging behavior that had never been seen before.

Speaker 2:          00:43:18       So in a sense, what we see in human beings, we see big differences in cultures in the way people are treated, the way women are treated, the way we, they cohabitate with each other, the way, uh, just whatever the community that they live in, there's differences in the way we behave. But with most primates, would you essentially say like, most chimpanzees are most Benobos, that you can kind of uniformly say Benobos, behave this way. Chimpanzees, behave this way. Is this the only time you've ever seen like a complete variation of the standard behavior of a primate?

Speaker 1:          00:43:51       Um, as far as I know, this is the only example of something like this that's been seen but other ecological extremes and you get some radical shifts. But in lots of ways, this is the biggest cultural shift that anyone has seen. And sort of the social model, you have a bathroom trip. Um, and for me, what the biggest take home message of that is exactly what you just honed in on who these guys are, textbook examples of the inevitability of stratification and aggression and all and know it turns out it's not inevitable that can suddenly flip with some like unique circumstances, be transmitted multi-generationally. Anyone who could look at humans and say that there are certain inevitabilities to some of the most unpalatable things we do. They don't have a leg to stand on if at Boone's have the behavioral sort of flexibility and plasticity built into them just lurking for a unique situation like this and suddenly six months of a different cultural style and you adopt it and pass it on a can. You don't have a leg to stand on to say that certain of the worst things about human culture and behavior is inevitable.

Speaker 2:          00:45:05       No. What we vary so wildly from continent to continent that we've kind of gotten used to it, but to see it in, in another kind of primate and to see that circumstances can change the way they behave. And, and literally change their entire community to the point where decades later and it's like 20 years later they're still the same. Right? Is that the case? They, the culture there went for about 20 years and is it, does it dissolve now? Did it involve back to normal baboons behavior?

Speaker 1:          00:45:36       Originally, it basically ended when the troops sort of moved into the vacuum created by the TB outbreak and moved into the lodge area and they kind of disintegrated as a true. A lot of them got habituated enough to the humans there to represent the danger game park rangers had to kill about half of them, so the troop basically does not exist anymore,

Speaker 2:          00:46:00       but for about 20 years. That's crazy. Well, does that give you hope when it comes to human beings because it seems like it's such a radical shift or the behavior of a primate without a language that to to see that that's possible, that just a shift of circumstance can change the entire behavior pattern. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       His troop. Yep. I mean sort of the, the, the take home messages to, to usher in rural piece with humans just like go give tb to males, but I guess that's not the sort of most obvious take home message, but I mean you look at humans change. Human cultures change the 17th century, like the most terrifying people in Europe or the Swedes. They spent the whole century rampaging through Europe and they've now gone more than 200 years since they've had a war. World War One, Christmas trees in 1914. All it took was about four hours of British and German troops fraternizing from across the lines while they were supposedly doing nothing more than retrieving dead bodies from no man's land between the trenches and before it was over with. They were praying together and having Christmas dinner together and playing soccer together and exchanging addresses to meet after the war and were they held out for days at some of those points until officers had to show up and threatened to shoot these guys unless they went back to trying to kill each other. Change can occur very dramatically. I mean these days there's an entire agencies that devote a are devoted to Vietnam veterans going to Vietnam, going back for reconciliation ceremonies are going back to, you know, foundations that literally build bridges across the rivers, helping schools, all of the what of that could have been conceived of like 1970. Yeah. Humans have an astonishing capacity to change.

Speaker 2:          00:47:58       It's just, it's so fascinating when you consider all of the variables that cause a person to be who they are, to behave who they are and then them interacting with all these other people who share variables and have unique variables and that there's just so many different factors in what makes a community a city, a country. It's pretty mindboggling would consider all the variables. It's utterly

Speaker 1:          00:48:25       boggling. And just to really get sort of provocative or at this point, um, what one does with all that complexity and with all the biology we haven't discovered yet, and all those gaping sort of holes of explanation as to where that behavior comes from. This thing we call a freewill. Yeah. All free will is the biology we haven't discovered yet.

Speaker 2:          00:48:53       Yeah. Sam Harris broke my brain talking about threewill once where I really believed it was real until he started explaining to me determinism and all the different variables and yeah, I mean do you do. There is a little bit of something that we have where you're talking about the frontal cortex that allows you to resist things, but like why is yours the way it is? Question,

Speaker 1:          00:49:11       right? Yeah, and if get some of it had to do with how stressed or mothered was when you were a fetus, like how are okay, like here's a just on the level of sort of sensory stuff going on. Just the sensory cues we're getting into the world and how that's influencing our behavior. Put up a pair of all his upholstered with just showing a pair of eyes on a bus stop and people litter less display a pair of eyes on a computer screen and people become more generous and online economic games because it's tapping into. I'm being watched. Stick somebody in a room with smelly garbage and they become more socially conservative on questionnaires. They're filling out because something just feels this really disgusting and that biases us towards deciding that something that's different is different than wrong. People don't become more conservative about economic issues or geopolitical stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:50:15       They're just more likely to decide that them's who do something different from you. It's not just different, it's wrong because something just feels kind of disgusting because they're smelly in a room. One very influential study looking at 5,000 judicial decisions over the course of a year and a parole board system and the single biggest predictor of what decision a judge who was going to make if they gave somebody parole or sent them back to the slammer was how many hours it had been since the judge had eaten a meal. Because when you got hired glucose levels in your bloodstream, your frontal cortex works better because it's a real expensive part of the brain and when you're hungry, you feel less sympathy. You feel less empathy. People become less generous and economic games and how much would you contribute to this and what sort of a judge has to do.

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       They're in a situation. Anytime we judge is do this difficult frontal task of trying to view the world from somebody else's perspective and they're hyperglycemic, you haven't eaten in four hours and it's more likely that your frontal cortex in effect is going to say, screw that, that's too hard. The guy's wrong, and send them back to jail. What's most amazing is if you had gotten one of those judges two seconds after they made that decision that could most be predicted by the effects of glucose on the brain metabolism and asked them, so why do you make that decision? And they're going to be quoting like enlightenment age philosophers or something. And that's just like rationalization running to catch up with the biology that's just rumbling underneath the surface there and influencing our behaviors.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       Wow. So like maybe one of the best ways we can enhance society is keep people well fed and lower stress.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       Yeah. Um, if nothing else, like what people have known for decades when we're stressed or like learning and memory doesn't work that well, then people learned were more likely to be anxious and learn to be afraid of things we don't need to be afraid of, and then we learned were more likely to have horrible judgment than have her frontal cortex not work very well and the newest realm of that is, and when you're stressed, you're less empathic because it takes a lot of work to try to view the world from somebody else's perspective and worry about their worries instead of your own problems.

Speaker 2:          00:52:42       And if you're in a defensive or worried position that you're most likely to lash out, you're most likely to protect yourself quickly. Yep. And quite literally a part of the brain that's involved in empathy doesn't work as well. When stress hormone levels are elevated. Now what about the frontal cortex and an actual damage like damaged from car accidents or head trauma?

Speaker 1:          00:53:06       One incredibly interesting, contentious area. You massively damaged somebody's frontal cortex and they will know the difference between right and wrong. Yet, they still cannot regulate their behavior on the most fundamental level famous neurological patients in the 1840 [inaudible] phineas gage, a, he had part of his frontal cortex destroyed in a. He was a foreman of a railroad construction line who have problems with some dynamite. Somebody did something wrong, the 13 foot metal raw shot of one of his eyes and at the top of his head and took his frontal cortex with landing about 50 feet away and gage who was the sobriety. This devout reliable, he was the foreman there turns into this dis-inhibited crass sexually abusive bully afterward who never was able to hold a job again for years afterward because you would take an outage, frontal cortex and you damage the frontal cortex and you get dysregulation of volitional behavior, which is once again we have saying people know what the optimal behavior is, the difference between right and wrong, and yet they can't regulate their behavior.

Speaker 1:          00:54:21       Something like, depending on which study you look at, something like 25 to 50 percent of the men on death row in this country have a history of concussion head trauma to the front of their heads, and that's a world of like volitional control is not that volitional because that seems to go contrary to the idea of a lobotomy then. Okay. Luvata bottomy was just. That's great that the law bottom, he was just like savaging about the front. Third of the brain is giving you the front photo is also getting limbic emotional. What did they do when they did the potteries? Well, by the time it really got developed, the guy like one of science's amazing irony is that guy, a Portuguese neurologist named a cosmo knees who developed Lucado. Amy's is what they were originally called about the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine for this wonderful technique, and then when it hit America as a sort of psychiatric intervention, good American knowhow and can do spirit, decided to get a sort of assembly line approach to it.

Speaker 1:          00:55:27       Finding Walter Freeman pioneered sort of rapid, like wham Bam, frontal lobotomies where you would insert in the high pick through some an ice pick rather behind somebody's eyeball, go up through the optical cavity there and go in there and just screw around and there, you know, I mean he had like instructional films in the fifties for having, you could do a frontal lobotomy and like one person every 10 minutes and just like go through an entire hospitals where the psychiatric patients in one like devoted afternoon of calvinist ethic, hard work. So they were just scrambling it and they were scrambling. So the neurobiology of like what you were disconnecting there was, it was like virtually random other than you were just making a mess in the front part of the brain. So frontal damage instead is a much more selective issue. Do you shutter when you think about the fact that that was just not even 100 years ago?

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       Yeah. Um, you know, Code Code Code on medical school library and go keep floors down to the sub sub basement and like go read some of these journals from like 19 or whatever. And like, yeah, you shutter her, my God, the things they didn't know them, my God, the damage they could have done. Then the damages to the causes of disease, the causes of psychiatric disorders. My God, some of the things they were doing that and if you've got a shred of capacity for self reflection, you then have to sit there and say, well, a hundred years from now they're going to be looking at our level of knowledge and they'll be saying the same exact thing.

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       What do you think would be the Big One? What do you think it would be? Antidepressants. Do you think it would be painkillers that they're handing out? What do you think we'd be the big one that people be freaking out about today?

Speaker 1:          00:57:19       I think about what we think what we're doing now. That's. I think it's overwhelmingly good at b, my God, that that quaint, medieval destructive belief they held onto them about human agency and freewill. Whoa. They punished people who had brains that couldn't regulate their own behavior. They punished people who because of toxin exposure or stress during adolescence, wound up with brains that couldn't control this or that a particular junctures and they used words like justice back then. Wow, I can't believe the stuff they did. It was practically like gangs and Gordy risk, peasants getting burning torches and going and burning down into whatever's around the medieval castle in terms of senses of the word justice, applying to what biology has to do with behavior.

Speaker 2:          00:58:14       There's so few people that share this idea that you're having. I mean obviously your sense of it is so much more educated than the average person and you understand all the mechanisms behind all of these particular behavioral problems that people have and all these different things can affect the way human beings operate, but most people are not aware of this. I mean literally most people like if you had to guess, if it's. It might be in the 90 percent of people haven't really considered all the factors that lead to someone having a brain that would put them in these impulsive decision, terrible decision making situations.

Speaker 1:          00:58:51       That's what gives me a little bit of sort of optimism is most people though, at least in the West, have done that in a couple of realms like 500 years ago, if you had an epileptic seizure for smartest, most reflective, most compassionate, like middle ages, bleeding heart liberals even would have had an explanation for what caused an epileptic seizure, which is you were demonically possessed and the therapeutic intervention done Bernie with the and now instead we're know a century or two into having a mindset where instead we make a biological statement, Oh, it's not him, it's his disease. Oh, he's not demonically possessed these cuts. Something screwy with this potassium channels in the brain unless he gets synchronized outburst and every now and then he has a seizure disorder. Like it's taken us about 500 years to do that one to go from. This is a, a blast room.

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       This behavior where we know the intervention, which is to burn somebody at the state the same, oh, it's a biological problem. And we even recognize constraints with that. If somebody has uncontrolled epilepsy that's treatment resistant, um, they may not be able to get a driver's license, but you don't sit there and say, yeah, let's have a burning of the driver's licenses and the epileptics it's about damn time they got. But they were. No, it's a realm where words like evil or soul or punishment or justice, it's totally irrelevant. Oh, it's a neurological disorder. So it's only taken us about 500 years to get to that point. So maybe you know, we've done that cognitive leap at least once. There's no victims there though. There's no yet. Well, I don't know,

Speaker 2:          01:00:37       but most of the time obviously if someone's behind the wheel and they have a seizure, then someone dies. Yeah. But we don't think of it as someone doing something. We think of it there, they lose. They lost control of their body, like literally piloting a car, unfortunately. And that's what happens if I ever versus someone committing a crime

Speaker 1:          01:00:53       500 years ago. If an epileptic during a seizure where their linens flailing struck someone that would have been assault and battery because told them to go like sleep with Satan, that's damn fault and it's like it's ridiculous mindset. Now there's large parts of the developing world that still has exactly that view of epilepsy, but at least in the west, like that's an unrecognizably different mindset. No, no, that was not. They didn't choose to do that. That was something screwy with their biology. Like we've gotten to that so I don't know, maybe another 500 years and we're going to be able to do that with maybe half the jury's in this country are capable of doing the same thing of saying it's not him, it's his disease. When you have somebody with paranoid schizophrenia who in a delusional state that something violent maybe, I don't know, half of teachers in the country are able to incorporate. No, this kid isn't lazy. That's not why they're not learning to read. They have this thing called dyslexia, meaning there's abnormalities micro or macro maladies in their cortex and the part having to do. It's not them. It's like, so we're making a little bit of progress.

Speaker 2:          01:02:06       You see, you seem optimistic, optimistic, and 500 year time span. We think it's kind of playing out in the right direction. Just very slowly. Like when you see these like political debates, people on television talking about crime and punishment and, and none of these factors being discussed is incredibly frustrated. It's incredible,

Speaker 1:          01:02:27       really frustrating. And they will look back at us and say, my God, the things they thought then the damage they did then and all we can do at this point, given that we'll know a whole lot of the biology and look at most of this stuff that we've learned about the frontal cortex or oxytocin or jeans. And we've learned all of that in the last 50 years, in the last 20 years, in the last five years. Like you look at the distribution when these papers were published, um, you know, all we could do in the meantime is have a hell of a lot of humility before we think we understand what the causes of the behavior, especially behavior that we judge harshly because the odds are we haven't a clue what the actual biology is at, what's going on there. And we fill in those attributional yawning vacuums with this invention that we call volition and free will, has anything

Speaker 2:          01:03:30       on every use toxo for an excuse or for defense, for crime. I don't because there was that in case you remember twinkie case Dan white blood sugar level,

Speaker 1:          01:03:42       both that's been used of severe Perry Menstrual Syndrome has been used successfully in courts of law to mitigate sentencing of women who committed violent crimes, uh, around the time of their period having certain variants on jeans. This one gene, which unfortunately this variant is government, the horrible term. The warrior gene has been used successful in a couple of courts of law to mitigate sentence saying what? How are they? Have they used that? It's this, it's this. It's a gene called Mao. Alpha model, amine oxidase Alpha, it's got something to do with neurochemistry and something to do with the neurochemistry of aggression. The gene comes in a couple of different versions and one particular variant is associated with high rates of antisocial aggression in humans. If and only if the human was abused during childhood. In other words, that gene is determining absolutely zero. You're getting a gene environment interaction. The absence of an abusive childhood. Having this gene variant has zero impact on this behavior. So like ridiculous. Lee Simplified pseudoscientific interpretations. Findings like these have sort of led you into courts of law saying, Oh wow, has that genetic variant that's inevitable.

Speaker 2:          01:05:03       So is this similar in a way to, um, I believe it was India. They used Mri to determine someone's knowledge of a murder and they convicted the woman that made her guilty of it. Yup. Yup.

Speaker 1:          01:05:14       No lie. Mri is the name of the company in the United States that purports to have the technology well enough that they can tell if you're lying or not,

Speaker 2:          01:05:22       but it's all. But from what I understand, it was just functional knowledge of the crime yet, which could have been imparted in defending or trying to put together, just because you're obviously have a lot invested in this crime because you might go to jail for the rest of your life for it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       Yep. Basically there's no science for that. The science is not there yet.

Speaker 2:          01:05:42       So it would never work in America that, that case or should not, I should say ship not and should not work in India. India was going, yeah. Yeah. That, that's the case. So what have they done with this warrior gene? How has someone been exonerated?

Speaker 1:          01:05:55       Oh, where was it? I think it wasn't a court in Italy. Um, we're just sentencing was decreased because the defense made an argument afterwards saying, well genetically predisposed. So like that's

Speaker 2:          01:06:11       isn't Italy the place where they charged scientists with not being able to register when an earthquake earthquake by assuring the public there wasn't an earthquake. Literally tried them for that. I think that's my people. I think the dust is still settling from that one. I think most of those convictions have been overturned. But but terrifying that those people had to go to court. You imagine if you're a seismologist and you have to go, hey, this is not how it works. You asked Jesus Christ, I can't tell you when it's coming. You don't think I would be out of the country also. The fuck is wrong with you. Oh No. My son, the scientist is like being convicted of murder. So it's essentially in these less informed areas where these things have passed, like the Fmr, I think in India and this in Italy, the warrior gene thing.

Speaker 2:          01:07:03       Well what? But it's dangerous, right? Yeah. I mean you see like be careful what you wish for in terms of creative people. Learn more about science, more to sign. I'm like, great. Yeah. It's a little bit mighty scary. Let's see. I'm just knowing. I need to know it's 6:15 or should we wrap it up? Thank you so much. Really, really appreciate. It was a pleasure. I've been a fan of yours for years. This is a real treat for me. I was looking forward to it. Alright everybody, this is a short one but an awesome on. Thank you.
