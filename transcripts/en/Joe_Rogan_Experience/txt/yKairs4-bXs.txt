Speaker 1:          00:00          Back Up, ladies and gentlemen. Powerful Frankie the answer. Edgar. Thank you. Who's got more heart than this motherfucker? How about nobody ever? I mean, you might have as much heart as him, but that's all that's available as a human is how it's all it's available. There's no room for anything else that you can get to the top. If you get to the top. He got Frankie Edgar Heart, but you don't ever get to more than Frankie Edgar Heart. That level doesn't exist on the game, but you Ryan favor man, you ride favors. Got Some fucking mad hard to dude that Aldo fight. That guy took bombs from all the leg kick after leg kick after leg kick, boom, boom, boom. Made it five rounds after it's over. His leg swells up like more than twice the size of the other leg. He took all these Twitter photos. Yeah, it was terrifying.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Man is a Gamer too. Everybody who trains with them says he's better in the, in the cage and he is in training. Uh, he's getting this fuck. He's gaming as fuck and he's an animal man. We ride favors and animal. But I was so impressed with Frankie against cub. I was like, Jesus Christ, he's so relentless. I mean, he would not stop, just wouldn't stop and you could see cub, but there was a certain point in the fight where he was just like, fuck. Like, what is this guy made out of? He just doesn't get tired. It doesn't get tired. Cardio for days. Nobody works harder and unstoppable heart. Yeah. You watched those gray Maynard fights. Did he get hit with balls of the best fights ever? Oh my God. The two first rounds of the, uh, the two second fights, the first fight was a loss, you know, so it was like he lost a decision, but that was like early, early back in the day. But the second two fights, man, we're just fucking wars. They were so crazy. Right. That's what they, they fought three times, right? Yeah. Mainers. There've been the same right after those. No. Yeah, he's, well, he's definitely taken some serious punishment. He got stopped in his last fight, right?

Speaker 1:          02:04          Yes. Who stopped him? Oh, who do you mean your fight? I'll pull it up. This is a smart move by the UFC because Frankie was just kind of chilling, sitting on the shelf until Al Mcgregor. Now he's got to fight to keep them fresh while it's good too, because it's not even in the weight class that exists. Normally competes. Yeah. So it's kind of, or what happens? He still has that fight available. [inaudible] well, they offered him a fight against Tj and he's like, nope, not happening dude. He says he's open for it though. Is He? But he didn't take it. That's a tough match cause he's not faster than Tj for sure. How was he open to it if he didn't take it? He did an interview saying he's not shutting the door on it. Like he's open to it after this. But he said, oh, after this he said no to a title fight at the time.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Yeah. But I guess he said he's open to it. That's what I read in an interview. I'm going to happen. I wonder what happened. What changed? So Alexander Yakka view is the, uh, the guy that, uh, be stopped him and stopped him in his last fight. That it's tough to watch. Ross Pearson stopped him before that. Okay. Actually it looks like it was decision Yaka Yaka view is a decision. Bras Pearson stopped him. Sorry. Oh, that was in the second round. Nate Diaz stopped him in the first round. The Nate Diaz one was bad. And at Tj Maxx one is the cage. Yeah, the TJ grant one was bad to elbow. Yeah. So he lost badly twice in a row. T J K Odom and the first round Nate k in the first round, then Ross Pearson, Klm and the second amount, so three ferocious knockout losses in a row to gray Maynard. It's tough to see. Right. And then he law. Yeah, it's very, he's a nice guy too. I really like gray. And then the F, this is the last fight he lost by decision to a guy that you know, we never heard of before. And uh, he's, I mean, not that the guy wasn't a good fighter, I'm sure, but me, you think about he was fighting for the title, fought for the title twice, went to a draw with Frankie. I mean, they had incredible, incredible fight. But then the battery got drained, man.

Speaker 2:          04:07          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Lights cold black. Frankie Edgar's about to step out.

Speaker 2:          04:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Oh Shit. Here we go. Biggie, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Every comes charging. Ryan Getting Ready. His coach behind a man, Mark Henry is a fucking ridiculous coach. Good, Huh? Dude lit. It's tough to hear it, but you can hear him yelling out. They switch up their signals every time. They have a whole language for each camp. Front combinations. You'll see. I'll nervous the coaches and he's sweating profusely because he's yelling out was in Frankie listens like a fucking video game. It's insane. Wow. That's cool. For wins by knock off four by submission. Three fight win streak. V Bj Penn three times Jesus fucking Christ. Did he beat Bj Penn three times? How crazy is that? And the last one was just a demolition. The last one was hard to watch. Remember his fights with the Hendo? Yeah, those were good too, man. They were great. Yeah, and he's so undersized compared to Henderson. I mean Benson's a big one. 55 are and Frankie makes one 45 pretty easy. I like Benson at one 70 man. He looked great against Dash. I agree. And I love how he's willing to fight other people. He's like, you know, I'll fight anybody. What we was trying to fight Tyron Woodley, he was calling Woodlea by well at least trying to get that Johnny Hendricks fight.

Speaker 2:          05:34          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Yeah. It's very interesting man. Very interesting and no, don't have a fight, right? I don't think he's thing right now whenever say you say Hindo though. I think Dan, my bat confuse the shit out of me. So there we go. Number two and number three. Well three at Bantam, Uriah

Speaker 3:          05:58          and number two at featherweight. Frankie, the motherfucking answer Edgar reach is about the same and the same height. Yep. Super Five. Anything else? Virtually identical. It's crazy that he's 36 cause to me I was 36 and Uriah Faber when I was working for the UFC, he was like the kid that was 2123 and now and even 36 pack. Then you were like 30 when when you were working for the key and the cage. Now I'm talking about when I worked for the UFC, always worked for the UFC five 36 saw when you first saw him fight those king of the cage. Right. Cause I remember you were telling me about him. He bought in the WEC Hosanna what it was. He found king in the cage too. Did he? Yeah. Yeah. He can king of the cage once. Yeah. And then he went to WC and that's right.

Speaker 3:          06:47          I am so curious about this fight. He fought and Abu Dhabi has a blue belt. He wrestled his whole life, but he was a blue belt when he fought uh, uh, battling bean from American top team. That was the first time I saw him. Powerful. Justin Buchholz shout out. Yeah, he's right there. Yeah. I'm really curious to see how this plays out. Predictions. Frankie decision, right. All the way from three. You guys bet on it. Double or not. Then it's going to have to double on you. We have APP to get you later. Yeah. We have to get half of it, bro. You're night having a half later. They're not getting that. You think? I think Frankie wins three to two. That would suck. Let me close by. Imagine the means if you lose. Oh I know I'm gonna go. It's gonna be tough to beat that Bruce Jenner one though. So it was pretty, God damn funny is I Instagram 15 seconds of that interview. The part where she asked him if he was gay, are you gay? Cause please know I'm not gay. So that was hysterical. So is the vocal, he's like, his eyes are fluttering and twitching all these Panama hives and he's like, no. I'm like, I only, I've only been with women even though it was so believable.

Speaker 3:          08:09          Would have something like that. Like if you're transgender, they immediately ignore all the other ridiculous aspects of your behavior. Like the fact that you fucking killed somebody a couple of weeks ago by pushing their fucking car in oncoming traffic in a Humvee weren't paying attention. Yeah. I mean that some talks about poor lady and they said he was dialed. No, he wasn't texting. Sure wasn't paying attention though. He wasn't paying attention when he's driving. Was it after or before? Was before. Before he came out. Maybe this is just a big distraction. No, no. He was already transitioning. He's been taking hormones forever. Here it goes. But if it's also the fact that he's living with attention whores his whole life, I mean it's like he lives in a ridiculous household. I mean all these things come into account, but he was the greatest athlete of all time. No, no, he's definitely, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          09:01          When you win, when you win the gold medal in the decathlon, you know why you are no real athletes were competing in that shit. Go. Is that the point? Michael Jordan was not in the fucking decathlon too. Any black guys compete? Kathlen okay, here we go. Here we go. Here he was the greatest shut up. Okay. How's this play out inside leg kick by? By Friday you got hit in the sack. Come on, come on. Oh, that would be nice, I think. I think you're right. It has the power advantage. Would you agree? A hundred so Eddie, you're, you're, you're free. You're right here, right? You know what? You taking your Ryan, I, I forget the Bat. Who's the bet? Ooh, I got your eye on this one. This is the bed double or nothing. Eddie Bravo has your, I got Frankie. I can't believe you made them take your ride a double or nothing. Even though you were, you were very strong coming into this. Is it me or does Frankie Edgar's like way bigger than your Rocky's big? Well there's the same height. It looks bigger. I think your eyelids thicker. Yeah, he's thick. I guess it's the camera angle. It's also way Tanner. It's interesting like they're moving like this is a five round fight. Like Frankie's like nice and paste slowly. Lot a lot of footwork and movement but nothing crazy as far as output.

Speaker 3:          10:19          It's going to be a really close fight man.

Speaker 3:          10:23          It's interesting seeing fracking not have a speed advantage. No, I agree. The rice fastest fuck man. And then one 45 you know he's used to fighting those one 30 fibers. I W I think I like the fact that it doesn't have to cut as much. Wait for this fight to again at 36 it's probably he goes hard and smart. Like I said, I think you're right. Has a power advantage in that he comes off of weigh ins and has a picnic on the ground like immediately does. It does. Yeah. He's soup eating salmon off the fucking spinning back. Kick [inaudible] tell you what your eyes are smart as far as business wise. It goes there. He's smart guy. Yeah. Well he owns a ton of businesses. Chino in Sacramento in cars homes. He's got a casino. You have like part of a casino. He torque. He sold. He sold a other companies. A case Swiss. Hey, tell you what man. Torque is a fucking great company. They make really good gloves, man. There their boxing gloves or my favorite boxing gloves ever. Really for working out. They made fight catch. No, they made shirts. Dude, when next time you over my place, I'll give you a pair of gloves. He gave me a few parents and they're really fucking good man. They're super comfortable. Like they're the most comfortable a bad gloves I've ever used him.

Speaker 2:          11:36          Okay.

Speaker 3:          11:36          Then you guys just always connected with the right people. A smart, yeah, we'll torque is a real good one. They, they make outstanding equipment. They were great. Hand wraps, great. Everything his other company was for. Oh, that didn't land as Duane Ludwig working with him for this fight. You're I in Dwayne. Don't see to, these weren't wearing masks and Martin. Ooh, rank you with the take down.

Speaker 3:          12:02          If this is going to be a long fight, it's going to be close. This one's going down. The judges that he, this is going to judge. You better not fuck me. I swear to God, man. I'm going to freak out. Freak out. They're just me. Just memes and $1,800. It's weird. You see these like these logos all over people. Shorts is the last time you going to see this. They got another month of this going to mess them. Me Too. Some companies are like high Bussa man. I mean they've been around a long ass fucking time. They're all just going to go to Bella Torque, right? Don't you think they want to be in this business? This should go over to bell toy. I mean they're already there and Bella [inaudible] it's just not anybody watched Beltre last night I did. Who won the Kendall girl fight. Kendall loss. He got beat up man. Bay To do, didn't meet Wade. Right. So the, the stripped him of his title. Kendell got finished yet round third round. Wow. Was it a five or four still cy fourth round by round. Five rounder. Yeah. Can he just kept taking Kendall down over and over? He's a big fucker. I heard he's muscular.

Speaker 3:          13:13          He get ate up in the UFC though. Good low, good Frankie going high with the kicks. I was really rooting for Kendall. He's a good dude. Great Guy. Great dark jokes. Yeah, he's been around a long time. Really has, he had a lot more experience than that guide foot. I was super Antwon when, whenever glories on, on spike up. Super into Oh yeah. You see those heavyweights? Paul? I'm a big fan of Laura Dude. Gloria's it shit. I don't miss them.

Speaker 4:          13:46          Okay.

Speaker 3:          13:50          Yeah. Niki holes can just one of my favorite fighters for sure. In any sport. Yeah. You fall on that last one, right? Oh, did you see the arts 11 Simon Marcus fight went to a draw. That's fucking amazing career. Uh, do you see those heavyweights? No. There's no girl in glory, but there's no famous girl fights. More time Ronda Rousey kickboxing. It would be cyborg seeing it. Dom beat Cyborg. Who's that? Italian client. Tiffany time bomb. She's a beast man. Tiffany time. Yeah. Know her last name but she's, she's easy on the eyes and she, she's a beast. Yeah. There's some pretty girls that fight Moyie Thai, but it's um, it just doesn't have the eyes that grappling that Gnarly's up your face. I'm curious to think. Elbows and the arms. So good for him either. Yeah. Moitai true. I'm curious just to see, to hear your critique of Kathy long striking and how she moves and all that. Cause I never really paid attention. Oh, she's bad ass. She's very high light rail man like maybe a year ago. And I work with her. We,

Speaker 1:          14:52          we train at the same gym, but I just never followed women's kickboxing. I knew she was famous. I just never seen any of her matches. And One night I put on a highlight reel. Kathy law, I'm on familiar. Holy Fuck Dude. Pull by law. She was Kathy Long, Howard's role dynamic and just so full of fire chief from walks, whoring walks or sheriffs like she comes out. Ah, fucking on fire. She got mad at that round two. So, uh, who won the first round? Frankie, you think so? Yeah. Down that takedown. He was barely a take down. Buddy can kick to the body when it's this close. Those takedowns and cage presence and the pressure. When's your rounds? Oh Frankie. Right the knee. Oh, your wire. Rather with a knee. You ride with a kick to the body and you ride with a kick to the knee. I think I said Frankie. Frankie barely won that. First of all in favor.

Speaker 1:          15:44          Yeah. If you're Ryan can make this more of a kicking contest. That's not like Frankie strong suit. Oh, but look at that. Frankie throws a spinning back. Pays for it though. Oh, we got out of it. Goddamn is quick. It's nose is bleeding. I think it's always bleeding. If he sneezes and starts bleeding, that's like me, man. Wow. It's just normal. You know, you get punched in the face all the time. Mine just dry enough to add no surgery. I blow my nose blood everywhere. When you had a nurse, no surgery, and you had your, uh, your pipes opened up, did you blow some insane boogers out of that? That was awesome. Oh my God. I felt the best thing in the world. I took photos of them and I put them on Instagram. I almost made Thompson Mura throw up and sounds terrible in the airport.

Speaker 1:          16:27          Oh, it wasn't Instagram. I don't think back then it was Twitter, but I almost made whoa head kicked by Frankie. I almost made Thompson gonna throw up, so I showed it to him. Anyway, that's a new Frankie Edgar man. He's still in some serious a kung fu kicks. Yeah, he's throwing some cakes. I like that. That's that Mark Henry and Phil nurse, man. I would blow some boogers that were bigger than a quarter. Like I couldn't, didn't sell big data. It's crazy ones. And they were bloody and it was like aliens when they, when they took the things out of your nose. Right. Like how many stitches? It's the best feeling in the world. Yeah. Because I had plastic splints in there for like two little stitches. It made my nose wider than the actual space open. The dude who did it, he was a wizard. He retired, but he knew his shit.

Speaker 1:          17:16          He cut out all the tr, I think they're called turbinates the inside of like the, the bump, the bone bump, cut those down and then like cut out all the scar tissue at a ton of scar tissue and put these fucking tubes in there. And then splints, he's plastic splints. The stitch it up and when it was over, like my nose is wider, like all this shit. Like he like opened it up like nine, change the shape. You break that down. Oh my God. It's amazing. My doctor sucked. I don't breathe. Great man. Well you still get punched in the face. I haven't been in the face tat much since

Speaker 3:          17:50          the surgery. Uh, the trash brown upper cut didn't help. That's life though, Dude. For most of my life. I couldn't breathe out of my nose. Oh, Frankie. With an overhand right. That was very nice. Yeah. What you call a mouth breather. Look at this. You get that? Say, hey, that's a nose, I'm jealous right now. Have to honk on your belly. Breathing efficient. I love it. I'm so happy with the surgery. I didn't even bother that much and I got two nostrils that are totally different. They're all fucked up inside. You like the ones really like the sliver and one's a whole. Yeah, I had three quarters blockage on one side and almost a hundred percent blockage on the other side. Yeah, my nose was useless at a quarter of a nostril. And that's it. You don't having where they, where they go in with the drill and just kinda get it out of like all the shit. Cause I used to, I used to not addicted, but I'd use it every damn day. Sprint. Yes. I'd use African like clogged everything man was addicted to that shit too.

Speaker 3:          18:51          You know? I'll just do it every loosens you up. Joey Diaz is addicted to it. He was joking around about it on stage. It's horrible for a man. It's like when I did coke I can fucking breathe. Perfect. It was, now I'm addicted is fucking Afrin. Can't breathe. Yeah. That African stuff, I don't know. I'm going to stand up. Makes the veins smaller so then you nose doesn't work as efficiently. Yeah. When you get addicted to it, when you don't have it, it literally will make your nose the inside of it. Swell. Yup. It's just so crazy. So I had to go in, they had like this little drill and just caved out. Polls. Oh yeah, like co quarter, right, where they taught cauterized. Yes. That's what they were doing. It was nice. Did it help? Helia and then he got punched in the nose again. Back to square one. Fuck. So many fighters talk with like nasal Uriah talks, nasal. Do I sound nasally a little bit. I can't stand when I listen to myself. Talk to see who's the most nasally. Vandelay was used to be, but then he changed his nose to mean van got a good, a nice soft side. You got a good family. So it's like face off Nicolas cage style. You will see, it's like a little article. That is how he sounds.

Speaker 3:          20:09          I supposed to do a podcast with him hitting nine full, showed up two hours late. Two hours late. It's very good. Got To food. He was two hours late and left. Really sent me text. Sorry. Cool man. Okay, thanks bro. Is this, oh, that vendor, they Silva. He was late to two hours to wise to what? Applying pursuit in Brazil. My friend in Brazil, there's is no time. Nah. For real though. He changed his entire face. Face off style. I'm thinking about doing that. I wouldn't mind a new microscopic Kathy long. Who? The highlight reel. Yeah, check out. Wait, is she old school? Oh yeah. I'm talking about right now. No, no, no, but she actually is 50 years old and wants to fight. She's in great shape. She looks good. She's in great shape still, man. She's the best female fighter I've ever seen. Says Chuck Norris. Chuck cut through all this shit and you had some actual fighting holds black belts in three styles. Her and Brian Cowen and she'd always have her hair up. She is bad ass though. Ooh, look at that girl. She's fighting. It looked like my mom.

Speaker 4:          21:17          Okay,

Speaker 3:          21:18          boom bitch. There's some high level shit. This is like in the eighties dude. Yeah, it was a PKA karate days. Okay, here we go. Polls. Come on. Don't show me that. Her fights, man. She's good. My mom, my mom, my mom would fuck her up. Come on. Put some on her son. It's so funny. His fight as good, super close man. These fucking ground, but I did not cost me 18 hundo. You imagine Uriah pulls it off if he wins the next three rounds. Well that is tough. That last round is a toss up, right? Well if Uriah wins three out of five, that's all he has to do. That's what I think. Slow three. Oh, who the fuck knows man? Who the fuck knows there and around three?

Speaker 3:          22:22          Yeah. Edgar is probably going to get the decision. This is a weird fight for Frankie to man, right? You can see rise not even ranked at one 45 he comes back to one 45 navy beats Edgar. He's right in the mix. It's about your legacy though. Ooh, good I to hand. It's about your legacy though. You know, beating a guy like your eye, the super fights. A split. Like what's left for you, Ryan? Frankie to do. Yeah. Title should be nice. They both been there. They've both been champs. Right? You know what's crazy here? WC was, but he didn't know. It's crazy seeing this fight man. Is that like thinking like man, your Riaa almost could've fought BJ Penn. That would have been saying throws a wheel kick that

Speaker 3:          23:02          Uriah fighting against Bj Penn would have been insane. How cool is super fights though with with these amazing legacy of these guys? This is what it's about. Yeah. Like I don't want to see Frankie fights on his weight class. I don't want to see your, I fight someone. They've been there. They've done that. I think this is your eyes weight class. What would be your all kind of look at that old liver for the canteen. Nope. No Man. Frankie got out. Shit. You don't think Frankie trail piss out of that every damn dead, but still impressive nonetheless

Speaker 3:          23:34          hard. Keep them down. Yeah. Right back up. It counts though. Those count the judges check one for the Frankie check one for big brown. Sorry Eddie. You could see how and see what this heavy super fight. Jon Jones rushed cane. Yeah, I think so too. I'm in John Jones or said Weidman. Come on son. Oh, I like that. I must do small. How dare you. Are you serious? How dare you Jon Jones came. I was asking square garden. Want to see that too, but I just, I don't know if king can get through a training camp. You know somebody who is like putting this out there. They were like, you really think about what Cain did as far as like cane make no mistake about it. The baddest motherfucker on the planet in the heavyweight division, the heavyweight division, but the guys kind of like all of his injuries have kind of left that whole division in turmoil. It's like he's only fought a few times and she's only defend title 19 months or some shit.

Speaker 3:          24:28          Yeah, the, the, the heavyweight division's wide open. I, it'd be nice to CBRE doom when I think, I think it'd be better for the sport for dooms a character. He speaks well. He speaks Portuguese, speaks English, she can speak Spanish. Flu. He's a funny guy. He's on TV. He's skillful as fuck to fuck Uriah looking for the year teen again. Canes like a robot. All he wants to do is wrestle and not talk. Wants to do this for us all and not talk. That doesn't work well when you're trying to make money in this game. You know what I'm saying? Man, Frankie heavyweight champ, son, you ain't gonna be no. You Know Muhammad Ali shirts like k. You know what I'm saying? Keynesian going have that. Never know I, it's just a matter of whether or not he can stay healthy. Frankie said, yeah, we can, man. We're seeing how great he is right now is another hens. Oh Guy Man and Ricardo Almeida. He's shown that cub, Swanson, relentless, and it's now Ooh, better get up. Side slipped.

Speaker 3:          25:29          I'll tell you what's a dope ass super fight. I mean, yeah, it's a little early, but I'm just saying, hear me out. Connor Pedis. That would be interesting. Cool fight right? Pat is going to be out for almost a year. I saw batty fucked his arm up. I liked left Tuck, man. I like medicine a lot. Yeah, I do too. Pedis got a new girls smoke show pays to be the champ. Man Pays championing more. Well, you know what I'm saying though. I hear you. I still has that bed. His house, docent belt. She walks in. She's seen that belts on. Well you got think don't let me get them better when he was at pitch. Being here right now over my shoulder. You walk through my house. It just be on a straight fucking display. Just with a highlight tape of my entire career as the belt spins just himself. He used to wear it. The clubs. That was always the joke. I, Tim Silvia was to show up at a bar with fucking belt on. I'd do the same shit.

Speaker 3:          26:25          Ah, dos Anjos man. Holy Shit. Is that guy good? Huh? Yeah, I fell. Dos Anjos versus pedes was an eye opening fight. What's next for Dose Angeles? I don't, does he have anything? No. Um, he's injured. They be cowboy. Maybe mean cowboy. You do. If he batters Mech Dessie that she wanted 100%. Well I think, and if he does give them a title shot, what's that? Seven in a row now you know who's fucking flourishing of this Reebok deal is cowboy. He's like, Damn, I fight 12 times a year. I'm about to get paid. So right Dj like that deal too. I talked to him about it. Worked out for him. Works for some people. Tim didn't like it very much. Yeah. I think Tim summit's Great Hymn was only getting 2,500 bucks. Yeah. So this is an interesting fight. Head into this fourth round. Thank you. Thought Frank Frankie's up at least two to one. You think so? Yes. These judges though, man, it makes me nervous. Eddie, you're super quiet over there. You piss. We made this bet. Are you guys, I tell you what, I'll give her the money right now. It doesn't look good. That look fine. Yeah, it did.

Speaker 4:          27:38          Okay.

Speaker 3:          27:39          Did we go wrong bro? How about that? Bet with are not the bet. But the matchup with Machida and your boy, Yo Romero. That's a fine, it's interesting. It's very interesting. You all were marrow though. He keeps getting hurt, right? Yeah, he gets hurt too. He's not young and all that wrestling is in catch up. He's 37 he had a significant neck surgery. Like when he gets on the scale, he's got a big scar on the back of his head. Like a where's back of his neck rather like where they get the discs fused. I Dunno if he had disectomy or I don't know where he got it done. Merrick or Cuba. But there's that. And then there's the last fight with Jacques Rey that he had to pull out of. Ooh, that's a good fight too, man. That was a great fight. But him Rockhold gets the next title shot and then he got fucking jock gray. I don't know what's next. But you can't beat Kamozi. He'd already beaten the nest for a title shot. There's so many fucking killers at one 85 85 what fucks sakes? It's so stacked. Frankie's Donald, a lot of spinning back kicks in this fight. It's crazy. Your eyes kicking more than usual to, well I expected that I that would be a rye would have like if he had an advantage it would be in a kicking but apparently Mark Henry thought that to Tony Man. Mark Henry writes novels on his fighters notes and shit. There's a nice leg kick I got. Ain't just pulls that thing out so quickly and easily as the second time you're, I had like a little play on a single Ooh, nice left hook. Right Frankie retract.

Speaker 3:          29:16          I love Frankie. So this is a very good fight though. This is a very religious man. This isn't like the Cub Swanson fight, which is just a Frankie Edgar show. This is a good fight and hope bro. This is the to the highest level athletes we have in the UFC. Frankie Edgar's footwork, he's so consistent. He just, he doesn't waver. He does the same shit. He doesn't slow down, never slows down. Saint Pace for five and never stands

Speaker 1:          29:42          right in front of you is constantly moved. Only fight. He stood in front of me. Where was the gray Maynard fight and his coach, when he comes back to the corner market goes, what the fuck did I tell you not do? What the fuck did we talk about my bat? And it goes out there and beats the breaks off and move that to the first round you like, how is he even going to fight? And he came back and won. The second round isn't saying that heroic slam and then everybody goes crazy. There's certain fights that they really need to stop in between rounds. And if you looked at the beating the gray Maynard put on him in the first round, you would go, man, I don't know if he's gonna be able to make it. I agree. But then like look at Machida versus Rockhold like did, they could have easily stopped that fight in between rounds.

Speaker 1:          30:23          They wanted to, the wool they should have. They didn't even fucking put his mouthpiece in. I know everyone thinks that Machida was tapping, verbally tapping, but he's saying, I don't have my mouthpiece. He's trying to get a break and get the mouthpiece. Granted he was getting his, he was getting crushed. He got, he got hit in the temple. He didn't know where it was. So he got beat up. Yeah. That one. Elbow to elbow. Yeah. Luke. I mean he landed a lot of ground and pound, but that one should go at the end of the round was so loud. It was like boom. Like you could hear it like coconut style one 85 man, there's not, there's not a better division. So fun right now. You're right. I think you're right. Between Shaka Ray, Luke Rocco, nice takedown. Frankie Edgar. Yeah. Jocker a yacht. Rock hold. Why man feet towards hard Belfort.

Speaker 1:          31:10          Why men and valproate? Man, man, I'm Vito has some very fucking sophisticated striking as one of the reasons why. That's an interesting fight. Wildcard striking for sure. If that shit lands are going to sleep. Yeah. Ice. His striking s very sophisticated. Very tricky. He's so explosive too. But will he be though? That's the thing that's post TRT. He looks good now. Have you seen him a little bit in it? The ride loco photography? Yeah. Well, Ryan said, you know the photography is obviously him in the middle of punching, but he said he looks good. He lost a little weight for sure. But I've seen, I've seen a lot of the video footage of him sparring a in one of the Nicky Holt's can videos use him spar in the background. He looks fucking good dude. This is the thing though, man. As good as we think he looks, if you're a guy who's been on TRT or whatever, it testosterone your entire career, now you're off of it and you're fighting the baddest one 85 on the planet.

Speaker 1:          32:06          Where's your mental state at? How are you going to go? That fight went to the second round and you've landed that spinning heel kick and you've landed that left hand and he's not going anywhere. That's a good point. It's a real good point. Yeah. The real could point. Where's he going to be at mentally? Yep. That's the difference. Cause Chris Weidman, Chris Weidman said he uh, got his blood checked and testosterone is low. He's like, fuck it. I feel fine. Say like we me man. Well, his testosterone was low, but I guarantee you a lot of that is due to hard training. Hundred percent hard training just jacks your levels. You know? If someone says like, oh, I got my levels tested and they're really low. Okay, how often we training? How often did you train the week? When did you test? Yeah, when you're in folk, like remember when DC and Jon Jones both tested like super low?

Speaker 1:          32:53          Yeah, I do. What do you think about that? Because a lot of people said that that was so low that it was indication or indicative rather have them doing something. Yeah, because, well, I don't know enough about it, but I ran all the experts stuff. Well, whoever they interviewed and they said for them to be that low, there would have to be some sort of abuse, right, of, yeah, but I don't believe that. I don't think they know because they both tested. It was low testosterone to epitestosterone ratio, which is the opposite of knowing someone took steroids. It's low is the opposite of that, but we don't know where they started because DC's older, he's been wrestling all his life. Jonathan competing all his life. So before camp, where were they at? We don't know. We don't know. For them to test it. Maybe that's normal for them because they've been compete all the life.

Speaker 1:          33:39          So to jump at those accusations is fucking crazy. I think it's this training camp. It's like we'll do, we know like what a really fucking hard ass training camp does to testosterone levels. Is it been like, is it consistent? Is it provable? I mean, is is a, is there a baseline that they measured before he went into camp and then in the middle of camp, if you just test him randomly in the middle of the camp, you're just getting whatever he is right now. We don't really know. Yeah. We don't know what's causing it. You don't know how they were sleeping. I mean, that was a stressful fucking leader. You know, a lot of time. A lot of shit. Yeah, lots of things. Fight press conference. If you take a guy like you test Herschel Walker, I bet his fucking levels are naturally really high and you tested them randomly.

Speaker 1:          34:24          People are like, oh dude, he's on Shit. No, he's just a freak. You don't know what this level that epitestosterone a testosterone ratios. Even if you're a freak, there's like a natural level that you never get over. True. That's how like when you see a guy like who has like a 10 to one testosterone to advertise Chaucer and he has to be on onsite, but they allow you like a two to one, three to one. I think four to one. Nevada you six to once you still out sex abuse. Do you see the new rules? Not what are the new Nevada test sponsor? Steroids. Three year suspension. Oh, well that's serious. Three or suspect. If you test for diuretics or weed, what? Three years for years for weed. Wow. That's what we're going to lose. He sure. Jamie, can you bring that up? I say you're not sure.

Speaker 1:          35:08          I'm positive. I just read it three years for weed. Pretty sure. Oh No, I don't. I don't think never moving away from shit like that. Yeah, but they changed it that a sudden they changed that. No, no. Nevada changed the requirements as far as like how, what's positive and what's not like what, how, what level the metabolites have to be. They essentially don't want people fighting. Hi. Ooh, that was a Nice Jab I Frankie now. Yeah. I'm pretty sure man. Okay. This is a fifth round already. Fuck man. How'd that happen? You this first offense, 18 months suspension. That's for muscle. Relax, sleep aids, opiates, cannabis, cannabis. That's 18 months. Ah, second offense. 30 to 40% of your purse. Third offense. You said, didn't you say three years? I did. You wrong, son will. Well you were right for third offense. If it's the third offense and a fine. How about a fine of 75% of the fighters purse. Why don't you steal money from him? Didn't the Guy Fight? Why are you stealing money from him? Cause he was on one weed. Diuretic time. Two Years Prank. He takes him down. Look at this. Cocaine, two years.

Speaker 1:          36:15          Damn. How good is your rock ramble? Three years. Good left hook. Their first offense. Steroids? Yeah. Three years. First six months. 75 up to 75% of the fighters purse. Wow. First offense, three years. Second offense, 48 months suspension. All Mike, if you run from the test, 48 months. This my thing though, so avoiding 36 months. How many years? First three years. So like a guy like Alistair Overeem, right? He's been caught. If he tests positive we get, does it start now? Like he gets caught? Is it 36 very good points. If he gets caught now, is it 48 or is it lifetime? Lifetime suspension? Fine of 100% if you run for the second time. Well, I'm just like, so what are they going to do with Vandelay then because Vandelay there, there's like a big court case that's going on with him where he's saying this wasn't in place.

Speaker 1:          37:10          Right, exactly. They were so hoping they were going to catch Floyd Mayweather on steroids. 75% of 120 million. Yeah. Right. No Shit. Built a new Vegas. What'd you guys think of that fight, by the way? I didn't rush you. I enjoyed it. Me Too. I'm one of the rare people. You and I are one of the rare people that enjoyed it. Everybody that I know. Oh Shit. Frankie almost fell. Everybody that I know that saw it thought it was boring as fuck. I didn't make it up. A few people loved it. Loved it. I enjoyed it. It's a fucking match. You watch it again from start to finish. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'd love to see. I don't think you, I'm not going to pay a Hundo. I'll, I usually stream that shit hung on my DVR. I might watch it. I'd like watching Floyd's movements. We too, man.

Speaker 1:          37:53          He's just so God damn slick and that's the best way to box. The best way to box is he that guy beat the game 48 fights and oh and he's fine. Oh, and 500 million in the bank. He ones hoodwinked us to David conney ticket. Dave Chappelle was so fucking funny. He was at the comedy store and he said that when he was at the fight, Whitney Cummings yelled out, I love that girl. She yelled out in the middle of fight. Floyd Mayweather beats women. Dave Chappelle goes men to bitch into, he said it in the fucking audience. Fell out, fell out two bits. The

Speaker 3:          38:35          way he say he's laughing and they might had a cigarette in his hand, and men too. What's wrong with Whitney? Which doing well, she's empowered woman, you know, once a letter, but he knows what they already know. Well, you came in support them at the fight that you pay for a ticket or somebody bought it for either way much. Floyd's Paki I don't even know if it really happened. That's it. There you go. Five rounds, two minutes y'all. You can't trust these judges and 100% I'll look at Frankie. You're actually, it's pretty sad. 100% powerful. Mark Henry, Ricardo, Meda. God dammit, you should honey. Get you into that Batman. I never really lost that much off. Hence this sets up. Give me one. Fuck. It gets back to sons. This sets up an opportunity though for a new, completely new, a fresh start. Fights next week. Yes.

Speaker 3:          39:33          Yeah. Vegas. We're going to be their son. I'm in Connecticut hosted Espn Sports Center. Breaking down the fights. You got to go to Connecticut, Connecticut, Bristol. Ooh, that's where do you want a Anthony Johnson and Cormier? He got DC. Wow, that's a good bet. That's a great bet. That's a good bet to take it. What do you think of that? We think of that. What about Weidman? Belfour I got Weidman. I got white men. Someone who's going to be gangster and take feed. Tour. What? Hey, what about, what about Travis Browne? Andre last dog Brown. I follow both of them. I beat one of them. What? Who Do you want? Travis fucking Brown. So you want our laps and I see what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          40:26          You're catching onto this honey take scheme. The next week's card man is so stacked. If you go over about that one for a little bit, think about that one thing about DC rumble of course, and you'll check the odds, but it's all good, but isn't isn't a rumble like in China or something? No, he's back. He was in town for a while, right? Yeah, he was doing some seminars. I'm going to try it. I don't know. That's a tough one. Look at this fucking car, dude. Here's the fight card. That joy Benevidez and Morag has a good fight. Fuck yeah, it is Mick desk. No love. No, right. Well it's just because they carry the car to just so stack. It's also those guys suck at Social Media Dotson versus Zach Makowsky. No one's talking about that. That's a great fucking fight. The good fight too. That's a great fucking fights. Too many heavy hitters were. We're not talking about it. Ooh, Frankie one. How about your Ryan crazy. How about your Ryan Hall versus Hofeld and a towel? That's a good fucking fight. The good fight. That's one that PP boy. Uriah Hall. Did we shake hands? Yeah, we did remember you were like pulling away and I grabbed your hand and shook it.

Speaker 3:          41:42          I shake hands. I remember that. We didn't shake hands I thought and the double or nothing. I thought you doubles or nothing. I think you double it. Nothing for sure. Definitely double check. Sorry. Frankie Edgar. Thank you though. I was stressed. Yeah. This some next week's cardies is fucking insane. Crazy stack. It is a really good card. Do you guys seen the jinx yet and HBO? We talked about this already. I wonder if there's more others. More fights. Oh ma'am. Piles at the bottom. Guilt. Then we see that Kim Berkman. It's a good fight bro and bro Rose, this is dope. Yeah, it's going to be awesome. Roses. A little superstar man. She, she had a lost that finale, but she's going to be a star. Don Young Kim versus Berkman. No one's talking about that. That's a great fight. But rose doesn't want to fight. Johana why raw? Johan is a savage.

Speaker 3:          42:37          I thought you were saying she like turned it down now. No. Was trying to fight that girl in that White Polo fighter. She turned off by that. I mean maybe she just saying she don't want a piece of it right now. Right. Probably most certainly would find him. Doug let her get one window. Honor is, she's bad ass. She's cursed. Strikings nasty. Yeah. She's just so crisp. How's Frankie Conor McGregor breakdown? That's a really good fucking question because we've never seen Conor McGregor getting taken down, taken down and a guy quicker. Right. I've seen a guy quicker than him. You know who really would be interesting is Mendez, Chad Mendez versus Conor McGregor would be very fucking interesting. His Chad Mendez can shut the lights out. Oh, he has the most power that the lights out when he hit llamas in llamas was like, oh, what was that all about?
