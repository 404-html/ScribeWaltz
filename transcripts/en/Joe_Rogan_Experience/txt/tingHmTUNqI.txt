Speaker 1:          00:00:03       I didn't realize how good your hair is. Thanks. I'm losing it, but it's what's left of it is still rolling. Right? And we're live. Gentlemen. Hello Sean. Hey, how are you? Hello Tom. Hello? Joseph. Let's go. You guys did a movie. Did you make a movie? We made a movie. Did you guys do movies? We do. We're both the guys. How many movies have you made? A one. Well, I bet you've made it. How many of you made before? Uh, I like six, but yeah, but we've made one. We've made one. What's your favorite one? Other than the one that's right now? Which is definitely a favorite because you're promoting it right now. A sex drive. Sex drive is the one that nobody knows about. This first one, nobody knows about it. I mean it just, it was one of those movies that just opened a.

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       nobody knew about it, but it was a, it was a really, really fun movie. Maybe we can change that. It's on itunes or Netflix. Yeah. Yeah. It's all. Are James Marston's in it? This is the one. Is this one that you like when you made it? You're like, and maybe I'll go back to work in fucking construction or whatever. Yeah. So I thought, uh, I thought it was over after that. Did you finance it or anything? No, no, we made it. We made it with summit pictures and it was, it was, it was amazing. They, they, uh, we were in town trying to get a career going, you know, trying to try and make things happen. We were making a TV pilot at the time which was living hell and uh, and we had gone out and pitch this idea to a bunch of places and nobody bought it.

Speaker 1:          00:01:21       So then in the middle of our, uh, editing our pilot summit pictures called and said, um, we really, we keep thinking about that pitch. Would you guys be willing to write it? And I said, you know what? I tell them I was really busy. I said, tell him I'll write it if I can direct it, but I figured that would make them go away. And they said, all right. And so we went in and we wrote it and we turned it in and they green lit it. It was this crazy, it was just this crazy process where we got this movie greenlit and I think we wrote the draft, you know, in like a month, and we turned it in and they loved it and they said about it's a, it's a, it's a teen road trip movie. It's about this, these kids that, uh, it was kind of in the early days of the, you know, facebook and all that stuff and it might've even been, I don't know, I can never track the, it might've even been like sort of my space into facebook that era, you know, um, but it was about a kid who meets a girl online and goes to lose his virginity on, on a road trip.

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       It's funny. It is funny. Yeah. Meyerson's in it. James Morrison and he was really funny, uh, Clark Duke and um, and I had a good cast and there it is. Yeah. Wow. Good. Um, but it was a really great experience. It was really fun. And then we, we, we tested it, we did the test screenings and it just murdered, like, it just in the studio got really excited. And I thought, oh my God, like I'm going to have a huge career. And then movie came out and do not do any business at all. I was like, okay, I'm going to go back to Wisconsin and, and uh, not have a career at all. So is it true that instant family you hired Tom Because Bert Kreischer wasn't available? Yes. God Damn it. Don't tell me that man, that's what I'd heard. Well, and he was asking, he was asking for a lot of money, a lot more within where it is lofty with. He's like, Mark's gets, I want double what they were like, we can't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       So this movie is based in, uh, in no small part on your own life experiences. It is adopting an actual, you adopted like a full family and three of them in children. But how wild. That's a, that's a bold maneuver, sir. What were the ages? Six. Three and a year and a half. And Wow, what was the process? Um, well it starts, and this is how it starts in the movie as well. My wife and I, for years, I didn't, I wasn't making any money including after I made sex drive and um, I, uh, so I didn't really feel like I could afford to have kids. So whenever we talk about it I just be like, no, not there yet. And uh, and then finally, um, when I felt like I was doing better, I was starting to get a career together. I just started to feel like I was going to be one of those old dads, you know, like by the time the kid was a teenager, I wasn't going to be able to play with the, you know, I'm 49 now.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       I was 41 at the time. And uh, so God, is that right? Oh man, it's depressing. Anyway, uh, so I, I, uh, I made this dumb joke to my wife. I said, look, why don't we just adopt a five-year-old? It'll be like I got started five years ago and I'm like, I'm right back in the game. And she was like, you know, that's actually a really interesting idea. And I was like, no, I'm totally kidding. Didn't mean anything by that. At all, and, and then she went to a website and she showed me the website and then when I saw the website I was like, Oh wow, you see these kids, you see their faces, you start to learn a little bit more about it. And we just started having conversations and it, it went from there. Now now I've got three kids and a movie.

Speaker 1:          00:04:41       And they're all siblings. Yes. So they're all came from one mom. And would the, what is, how did they get separated from the family? Um, I don't have a lot of details about that, you know, they don't really tell you, you know, you know, a little bit, but not much. I mean I know that there was, that, there were issues with drugs and, and I think there was some kind of a fire at some point, but it's all pretty, pretty sketchy as far as what you hear. So you've learned a lot about the kids themselves, but not that much about the situation. And what, what made you want to turn this into a film? Like I would imagine that's a very personal experience. Yeah. Um, it was actually my writing partner, John Morris, because I had been about three years into it at that point and the beginning of it was a nightmare, like, like epic, bad decision.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       Why did we ever do this? Yeah, it was, it was really a nightmare for a short time. And then when it came online and we became a family, it really became the best thing that ever happened to me. And you know, when John and I get together every day, we just talk about our lives a little bit. That's how we get started. So John had been hearing all these stories and one day he just said, I don't know why we're not doing a movie about this because nobody really knows how this works when you go into foster care to adopt kids. So we started talking about it and then there was the conversation of whether it could be a comedy or not because that's what we do. We make comedies. And John again was like, most of the stuff you've told me is really funny. So not all of it, of course, but that's.

Speaker 1:          00:06:10       And then we thought, wow, we could approach this as a comedy and we might be able to get, you know, a more general audience to get their, their interest in it that way because it'll feel less scary because that's the problem is that most movies that are made on this topic just frightened people and they make people think that these kids are all, are all damaged and reachable anything, you know? Do you worry that it'd be like that movie 101 Dalmatians at a bunch of people start getting foster kids now and screw them up? Yeah, we. Well we were talking about top gun about how, you know, remember when top gun came out and everybody joined the navy thinking they were going to fly the plane. Well when the color of money came out, pool halls boomed across the country. I made a giant impact on pool halls for that one tom cruise movie.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       And it's just really a lot of people just got scammed out of their fucking pocket money. Some of that going on. I think the crazy thing about this too was that like on the set, you realize like when you were doing this, you go like, Oh yeah, I always thought of people who do that. Like you know, they exist, but you're like, those are nameless, faceless angels. They're not real people like you or like do any of your friends at top. I'd be like, Oh, don't not friends like that. Those are other people you know. And then you start like on the set there was, you know, people visiting or consulting and there would be like, oh, you know, they adopted are they run some foster care thing? And then you're like, oh this is actually something that people really do. Well. Even like dudes on the crew that somebody would come up, you know, who's in the electrical department, be like, oh hey bro, I got, I adopted two kids by the way, if you're like really, you know, or hey, I got adopted when I was four years old.

Speaker 1:          00:07:47       He just would like, once you see it now, everywhere people are hitting me up. Someone hit me up yesterday like my sister is adopting four siblings this week. Wow. Yeah. This is nuts. I mean like it's like something I don't want to. It's almost like when your friend gets a car and then you start seeing it everywhere. There's exactly like that though. We talked about that video that went around online of this little girl that realize that she's opening up a box and there's something in it that tells her that she's been adopted by these two people that are with her and it's really. Yeah. It's impossible to not cry. Yeah. I mean if you have any heart at all and you watch that little girl freakout and it's breaks you up. I think that's almost the test as far as what you were talking about about how. Because believe me, I tested if you're a piece of shit or when you watch that, we should show that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:44       What's your reaction to. Oh, you're a piece of shit. Sociopath. Yeah. But no, I mean there that what you were just getting at as far as, believe me, I'm not that guy that like, I didn't feel special or like any one of those sort of heart of gold angels, you know, we have a line that's in the movie where mark just says that's the kind of people that volunteer when it's not even a holiday. And we don't do that. Yeah, you should probably tell the audience that I'm not staring in this movie right now for people who know those people are like. So Tom Starts. This is Mark Wahlberg movie for like four and a half minutes. There you go. Mark Wahlberg. Stars in the rest of it. That's true. That's a good way of breaking it down. It was only probably like 90 minutes. That's pretty good.

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       That's not bad. Probably like seven scenes. That's good scenes. Now you've got a solid presence. You didn't make the poster, the poster, the poster. You made the standee though. Did you know that there's a standee in movie theaters in your and that. Oh really? Alright, I'll take that one. Heard that word. Standee Sandy. Those are the big cardboard, those things where I didn't know that either. Cardboard cut out thing. That's what I always call it cardboard cutout. Standee is the real. The real term, is that the term in the industry? So yeah, that's an industry term. That's a real industry term. You learned something today. Wait, so you. Because you were telling me this and I was like, he was about to tell me before you came in. I was like, this sounds like this could be pretty good. Don't tell me save it for the podcast that because he's done this is the most press sean's done for a film that he's put out that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       Did you go under? They were like, let's give you some advice on media. Yeah. Well first of all, I'm terrible at it, so there's that because I don't do. This is the thing when you direct a movie, especially movies like the kind of movies that I make comedies and you know, big broad comedies, people don't really care who directed those movies and I'm good with that. Like I'm totally good with that. But what usually happens is the studio, the director usually wants to be kind of a part of the campaign so the studio will find, they'll sort of throw bones at u of a press that you can do and I always tell them, look, if I can be helpful in any way, let me know. I'll do whatever you need me to do, but don't throw many bones because I don't care. Like I don't need to do that to kind just pump up the ego of the director that certain directors just really want to be the next Quentin Terica.

Speaker 1:          00:10:56       Yeah. I can't imagine there's some directors they really have to do it for. I get it. They don't want you to feel left out or whatever. But by my first couple of movies I thought, Oh, I have to do this stuff. And then I realized I actually had this experience where I was in this red carpet thing and they brought me up to this reporter and they said, this is Shawn Andrews. He directed the movie and she had this big look on her face. And then she went and I was like, Nah, it's cool, you don't have to. So disappointed. So disappointed. And that's when it sunk into me where I was just like, oh, they don't care. They don't give it. So that's, that's fine with me. I'm good there. Well there's such fame whores and those days are those red carpet things. There are so weird. Yeah. Those things are so weird. And some people that is the highlight of their life walking the carpet. I can't over here Tom. You're posedown right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:48       It's a really weird thing. Also pop. See at the airport you have that where um, I've seen them where I'm at, baggage and they're looking around and then they're like, hey tom. And they'll ask me like, what are things? They're obviously not there for me, but they're like, they're like, we got time till fucking whatever. Seth rogen gets off the plane. So let me ask you something. And then they're like, oh, all right, nevermind. Here's everybody like, just blow you off and you're like, I happen only one time because this obviously doesn't happen to me. That was flying into lax and I was getting off a red eye and I was so just tired. I looked like shit and that, and this guy, these two guys come up and they just were so nice. They were like, Hey, you're Shawn Andrews. Right? And I was like, yeah, yes I am on editors.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       They nobody ever, you know, and so it takes me a second to realize and I thought it was so weird because they were, it was right after, it was shortly after daddy's home and that was like the biggest hit and they were asking me about horrible bosses too and I was like, why are they asking me about, of all things. And I thought, oh, because Jennifer Aniston's in it. So they want me to say something about Jennifer Aniston and just see if they can catch me saying something crazy and looking for a soundbite slip or something they're trying to do. Yeah, it's weird. And my wife is like, what was that? I'm like, I, I. It took me an hour to sort of trying to make you click bait. It's not.

Speaker 2:          00:13:05       Well, what's interesting too is it's sort of an impromptu interview that you have to do, right? Like if someone said, hey, this guy's name is Mike, he lives in studio city, wants you to go to his house and he's gonna film you, he's going to ask you a wacky questions. He was like, no, but if Mike shows up at the baggage claim and puts a camera in your face, hey sean, Jennifer Anniston, man, what's up with the Botox? You're like, what the fuck? You know what I mean? That's how they get. Like, you wouldn't do an interview with them under any other circumstances, which is one of like, one of the weird things that happened during the Roseanne Barr things. Roseanne Barr when her show was canceled and all the controversy was going on. She was supposed to do the podcast and it became a big news thing, but because she put it on her, uh, her twitter that I'm going to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:13:52       And we talked about it and then they tried to show up at the podcast studio. So they had all these news people standing outside the podcast studio with their microphones were out out in front of where Joe Rogan does his podcast and they thought for some reason just because they're there, people have to talk to them. I'm here, talk to me. The, the, they're made out of milk. They're barely human. The way they talk is the most boring version of an interview you'd ever get ever. It's a tiny, quick little soundbite where they feel like, because they're, they're like, the camera's on, I've got the microphone. Come on, do it. If they said, hey, you know, kw, fuck yourself once you to come in and sit down for an interview, you'd be like, no, I don't want to. I don't want to talk to them. I don't have anything to say. Like I'll do all my talking on the podcast. But.

Speaker 1:          00:14:43       Well, but, and also if you're, I mean I'm in the business, but again, I'm not somebody that does a tremendous amount of press or at least not until a couple weeks ago.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Um, and if you're not accustomed to that, it's terrifying. It's weird because somebody puts a camera in your face because immediately you're thinking like, well, if I just go, you know what man? Fuck you. Like I don't have time for that. Yeah. Then you're going to. So you just think like, I can't even walk away from this. So you just feel like you're all of a sudden somebody throw a cage over you. They're not even asking you, can I do this? They're just doing it. They're just, hey shawn. Yeah. Let me ask you a question, Shawn. It's forced. It's forced on you. It puts you in a weird spot. It's like all the sudden you're in your. You're on your, on your heels, because your instinct is to be defensive. If someone could say you're. You know what I mean? Your instinct is not going to be.

Speaker 2:          00:15:26       I'll give the most thoughtful answer to this because it's, it's, it's in the moment. Someone just dropped it on you, so now you're like, okay, and, and your, your emotions might be kind of all over the place and you're not, you're not stopping to like, like having a conversation. You're just sort of trying to figure your way out of it and how many people have ruined their careers or lives on those things just said, just fucked up and said one, they're just trying to be funny or just that's the thing, because they'll miss mutated and then they get ya, and then they put it up and you're like, fuck, why did I think through that? I was coming home from the airport. I was tired. I was jet lagged. Bordain got a shitload of death threats because he said they asked him if you had to serve dinner to Kim Jong Un and Donald trump, what would you serve?

Speaker 2:          00:16:11       You said Hemlock, it's trying to be funny, and then you all these mega fucking morons protestors were there. They were all sending these tweets like Potus, you know, he's threatening potus and it was so strange. Like, where, where is the NFL? You know, where's the secret service? They should lock this motherfucker up and like, you guys are crazy. It's a joke. And that's the thing right there is that click bait articles are they all make it so it'll say like so and so said this and they make it sound like somebody like called a press conference to say something ridiculous. And really it was like you said, it'll be some offhand remark and then people out there that are judging, they, they, they never have anybody walk up and put a camera in their face and they just think, well I would never say anything like that.

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       It's like you don't know what you would say. You're never in that situation. It's bizarre. It's very bizarre. Bizarre. So how many of these things did you have to do to promote this film? Because it, because of this film was based in large part of it. On your actual life experiences of adopting these kids. How many of these things did you have to wind up doing a lot? Because I did, we did our press junket in New York and I've done junkets and usually I do like six or seven or 15 or whatever I did in two days. I did like 90, 95 sort of the same questions keep coming back to over and over again. You start developing these canned responses. That's the thing you have to, and this is a mistake and this gets back to what you were getting at before, is that when I would do press on my movies in the past, I'd go to the junket and people would come in and they didn't ask you more or less the same questions. And I always felt weird because I just felt like, no, I just want to have a conversation with you. I don't want to be like

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       this disingenuous guy. And then I would be sort of changing up my answers and trying to kind of just essentially just made it boring and I wasn't really making any kind of a point whatsoever. So, uh, on this one they were like, look, you've got a message with this movie. You've got things you want to get out with this movie. You've got to learn how to do this. So I went, I went to like a day of media training and it was, I did, I did. And it was the worst part was I've done interviews and I've been fine before, but I got this guy sitting across from me who's, who's interviewing me doing this mock interview and then I've got the publicist and my writing partner and they're just staring at me and that will listen. I can't do it. Right. All the pressures there.

Speaker 1:          00:18:33       Who's teaching you? Who's teaching this training? Where they right away? Like, you kinda suck at this. Yeah, absolutely. I mean they were really nice about it. They were like, okay, well there's some, there's some room for improvement. Oh my God. Really? Oh yeah. No, it was the worst. It will seem like a natural. I mean there's what, what is there to teach you? Well now what? Well this, this is the thing that I'm really comfortable with this with, with us just hanging out here talking. But this is what I do is I yammer when I'm, I'm a nervous talker. So you asked me a question if I'm nervous, I just kind of go and go and go. And people are like, Geez us man, that guy talk.

Speaker 1:          00:19:14       So the thing is, I got this guy sent across me, really nice guy and he's The guy who's coaching me, but I know I'm going to give you like fake interviews. Well, he'd have a coach you first he gave me. He gave me a lot of really good insights and the funny thing is every rule that he's saying as he's saying it, I'm going, Oh yeah, I do that. Oh yeah, like everything he's saying that I shouldn't be doing. I'm like, oh yeah, that's. I always do. What is he saying you shouldn't be doing? I mean that the main thing, it's Kinda like what we were getting at before that when somebody is setting a trap for you, because so much of right now media training is just about don't go out and get yourself into trouble by going in and just talking about some ridiculous area that.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       Because that's what people, that's what everybody's trying to do now. Like just as a. for example, I did a Time magazine interview about adoption about a year before we even made the movie. Really? Yeah. And it was just because, uh, I was in the process of working on the movie and anyway, so the whole thing was just about adoption in my family and whatever. And it was right when the Harvey Weinstein stuff was blowing up. So the lady's really nice interviewing you. And then at the end she says, uh, hey, you know, since I'm talking to a Hollywood director, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff? And I was like, Nah. And I didn't even think about my answer because I don't know, I didn't know the guy was never around any of it. That's sort of like more like fancy movies.

Speaker 1:          00:20:34       And I was like, yeah, know I don't, I don't know, I never met the guy, whatever. I didn't think anything of it. I got off the phone and then I thought, oh, she didn't say, what do you think about this stuff? She said, did you know about that stuff? And it was like, and yeah, I knew, but I kept it a secret fuck those people. And I just thought right away, I, I just, you know, so yeah, it's, it's, it's sneaky. That's a sneaky way of asking to sneaky way to get you to, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Did you know what, if you don't enter his kept his secret for years. I'm such a dumb shit. I would have, like you said before, I think I think a year or two ago I might have made a joke, you know, and been like, oh yeah, I was there, you know, and just printing.

Speaker 1:          00:21:19       Yeah. Was there. And then I'd be like, what, you know. So uh, so you know, a lot of it is just just to kind of teach you how to just sort of stay on point so that you don't get dragged down these weird roads into these things that just, that people are looking to get you in on clickbait. So did you bring up that instance when you went through the training? Oh yeah. Did you say what should I have said? I think I did. I think and, and really what they, what they teach you. It was funny because believe it or not, he said, I'm going to show you some clips of, you know, sort of doing it right and doing it wrong. Oh, they have disaster clips. They say they do and one of them the file that you sent to Jim before the show, but you guys will probably all know this one, they showed me a clip of Quentin Tarantino, sort of like getting really angry with this reporter.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       Was that the violent thing? I thought it was kind of to kick some guys asked that lady was like, your films are disgusting and violent. And he was like, yeah, they're fucking movies dummy. Like he gets really upset about it. And where was this? Actually I ref it's the same one because the one that I saw was a guy. Oh, I saw him with a lady. Uh, but that was via sat, like, so this is a different one. Then there was one where the guy was threatening to kick the guy's ass. I don't. The one that I saw didn't go that far, but what? I actually kinda liked what he said because he was like, no, I'm not playing that game with you. I'm not doing any. Got Off. But I was sort of like, Eh, you know, I liked that he does that. I mean I, I liked the one with the lady. The lady is like, your movies are so violent and awful, and he was like a movie a make believe thing. It's not real violence. Like he really sas or it's funny as shit. And then I also, she, where was she? She was doing, you know, she was, she was like, good morning Pittsburgh, like the entertainment reporter and then he was actually probably doing like satellite stuff everywhere and he was just like, you're dumb.

Speaker 1:          00:23:07       But I also saw there's that guy, he's a Gotcha guy too. Did a Robert Downey Jr. It was promoting a movie too. I don't know if they showed you that one. Oh, that one. Right. And the guy said, now your drug addiction. He was like, wait, what? It was totally to try to get him to in a moment, robert downey jr is not having it. He's like, I'm here to promote a movie. Yeah. Um, this has nothing to do with that. Totally. But let's, let's get into your drug addiction during your darkest times. Like, what are you talking about? Man? Iron mans out. I'm not doing my hair for that. Well, it's just like the ends it too. They're so selfish. Like that thing is so doing shit like that is so selfish. It's such a sneaky little thing to do. Yeah. What did they teach you though?

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       Like in that moment of like when they're just like, don't, don't get emotional. It's like don't take the bait and, and more than anything for me, because I look, I'm from Wisconsin and I still have that kind of. everybody's nice. Everybody has good intentions to five, you know, so, and I had this experience on my very first movie where I, I talked to this reporter because it was a movie about a, it was a road trip, you know, this, this silly road trip comedy, you know, and I talked to this reporter and he says, and he was just being, he was being really cool. We were just kInda hanging out after this thing talking and he's like sit and gas prices were really high and he goes, so, uh, he's like, you feel weird about making a road trip movie when gas prices are so high.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       And I, and I said, eh, I don't know, I, I, you know, maybe if the movie tanks I can just blame it on that no one could afford to go to the theater because the prices were so high and I don't think. And then this article comes out that just the guy literally said I was swarthy looking and it just, he just painted me like an absolute piece of shit and I was like, that guy was so cool. Like he was like when we were talking and then he just destroyed me. I've been there. Yeah, I'm sure you guys have. Yeah, it's all new to me. I remember one too that like, who did it to me, like when I was just doing phone, like a phone interview for press before I was selling any tickets and the guy was just like a really nice guy and totally twisted things.

Speaker 1:          00:25:12       And made it seem like, just like he knOws what I was saying and he purposely twisted things around and then it had no impact, but I remember reading that and being like, oh fuck this guy. And, and be careful when you talk to these people because he totally, he knows what I was trying to say and I read this article. It's like he misRepresented everything. Yeah. Well that's the only way they can have fun. And that's the only. I mean if you're just a normal guy and you give a, you know, normal answers and you're thoughtful and considerate, that's not as good for them. Right. It's so twisted around, well it's not just, it's not as profitable. It's more profitable. And especially if it's an online thing with an online thing, you need to click bait title. You need a bunch of people clicking on that thing because otherwise you're not going to get any ad revenue for it.

Speaker 1:          00:25:58       Yes. It's a very bizarre model where it's encouraging people to be deceptive and to make these things inflammatory. And I got to say, look, I did, like I said, I did 90, 95 interviews and in the course of two days and virtually everybody was really cool, really asking really thoughtful, interesting question. So I don't want to make it sound like I'm ripping on tHe whole press over this. But yeah, there are these people. And that's the thing is that if it was every single person that came along, it would almost be easier because you could just kind of be like, okay, here we go. I got it. But you, but you get like 30, really good, you know, reporters with integrity and good people. And then somebody jumps in and you're like, oh, and then then, then they catch you not looking because you're not looking for that guy there. Also get super

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       jaded. You know, it's almost like cops that have arrested too many people. Everyone's a crook. Like they just think that everybody that we're interviewing is a piece of shit. And it's also like they're interviewing these hollywood people. They're thinking of you, you had a big mansion and driving a mercedes. You've got all this money. Fuck this guy, it's like this instant take on it. Oh, a hollywood director. Yeah. Right. How's your casting couch? Yeah. ShIt. Yeah, that's true. It's true. And it becomes the game. I think too, for them the game is like, let's see if I can get one and we should be really clear. This is not. Most people, most people are nice, but it's just like one. Even if it's only one out of 10, you run into that one. you're like, fuck these things. I don't want to do those things anymore.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       totally terrifying because you think about your family, your friends, like anybody who's going to cause now there, there is this. I know you guys talked about this a lot. There is this culture out there where people are completely reduced to like one moment or one statement or whatever it is and that's all you are. Is that whatever that thing that happened in that one moment and you know, you see it happening to people all the time and you think about so. So when you'Re there and you feel like you're just a regular guy, you don't feel like you know that it's really scary because you think about your kids and you think of it, you know, so it's a, it's a scary situation. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's a weirD time for these publications to be taken in consideration. No one's really buying magazines and newspapers like they used to.

Speaker 2:          00:28:12       It's hard to sell and so they're reduced to these online publications and they have to compete with a bunch of these click baity bullshit things and that's where the money is. I mean, even in New York times, man, the New York times is resulting to a lot of click baity shit now. And you're like, wow, well do you guys have that feeling? Like when you're online that you're on liquor clickbait diet where you see things where you're like, oh man, I totally want to eat that right now, but I'm not. I'm not gonna do that ingredient in a box. So sweet to navigate it. Now you read that title and you're like, I know this will have no substance. just the headline, I'm fascinated to see where this goes because this didn't exist, right? These online click baity things didn't exist 20 years ago and now they're everywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:28:59       it's like what? What's gonna happen in 10 years? Like, where's it going to be like, where's this going? Yeah. I'm very fascinated, you know, very, very fascinated to see. It feels like a transitional time. It doesn't feel like it can Hold out like this forever. That's true. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Because it hurts. I mean, and this is, this is the reason why I think podcasts, culture is coming on strong because it's a place where people just talk and have a conversation and I think that fear of slipping up and people always out there trying to get you to slip up or whatever, has people not havIng as much of a free exchange of ideas, but through these podcasts, one thing that does happen is people will take a very small clip out of context and then write a whole article about that small clip with a big click baity headline like thompson sigora shits all over people in Somalia and then you know, whatever it is, and then do that.

Speaker 2:          00:29:51       No, I mean it was a different city. I just made something up. But then you know, it could be completely out of context and over a giant overall discussion of a top of a topic that took place over 45 minutes and they'll take 30 seconds of that and put a youtube clip up and then you get a bunch of angry people at you. That's true. But the other flip side of it is that I feel like in this time we're developing more of an audience that is quick to call that shit out. So while there are going to be people that take the bait and be like, what is it? Get angry. There's a bunch of people who are like really quick to recognize that that's taken out of context. Well, it's because people like you and I and a lot of other people that do podcasts talk about that all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:30:39       So people hear it all the time, they see the examples of it and you go, wow, that's crazy. Some of it is so egregious. You're like, yeah, you're a piece of shit. Like someone should pull your license. Like if you were a doctor, they'd fully pull your fucking license as a journalist. He was a lot of wiggle room with p and a piece of shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But these are journalists, air quotes, these podcasts. This, this medium is just going to grow and people are embracing more this long form conversation and understanding things by talking about it for awhile. Well, and the other part of it that I think that gets lost sometimes is that, You know, like right now we're talking about like journalists, but the great journalists are just as hurt by this. This stUff is everyone because the people that are really out there being thoughtful, really researching their material, really talking to people, getting to the bottom of things.

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       That whole journalistic work ethic that we all grew up hearing about. The, those people are just as threatened by this cheap, the sort of attack journalism that happens because they can't even compete with it, with a, with a really thoughtful, well researched story. And then somebody like he touched a boob and then there's like the, they get all the clicks. You know, I was talking to matt taibbi who's a real journalist and matt taibbi was discussing the pieces that he wrote on wall street and uh, the, uh, the crash of 2008 and all the fucking shenanigans that went on with that and how much just crazy shit they're allowed to do and what they can, what a ponzi scheme. A loT of that 2008 crash was. And you went, I was talking to him, I realized he had put a year into research learning like he did not come from a background in finance, so he put a year into researching all the aspects of the savings and loan crisis, all the aspects of the mortgage crisis and how it took place and how they were, how they were making money off of this and how they were betting on things falling apart and moving money around and how fucking chaotic it is and how crazy it is.

Speaker 2:          00:32:47       And then you think of how much time put on that and then in proportion how few people actually read that and how little it affected the actual economy itself. Like how little things changed and how little people were outraged. Like his article, I don't know if you ever read the rolling stone piece on it. Fucking amazing, But you don't work on that for forever. Yeah, but you don't care that much about it. You know what I mean? It's like those people never went to jail. The billions of dollars just just disappeared. It all got moved around and everybody, abracadabra and they moved the cape data and then it moves on and you know, and he details it in this amazing way and you realize like, wow, how many of those guys are left? How many of those real journalists or are left? Right. And this is a, I mean it, you have to invest in something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       I mean, he's putting a year into just researching what this is all about. Yeah, it's fucking insane. I mean, and then instead, you know, it's like a kim kardashian got her butt done again, boom, boom. 50 times more. People are paying attention to that, that. Well, let me ask you this because I think in a weird way, this weird time that we're in right now could actually be the rebirth of that kind of journalism that you're talking about because I know that that when, when everything was getting kind of crazy and people were, you know, were talking about all this. I did a subscribe to some, you know, like the online version of some papers because I thought, oh, I do want to support people that are actually, you know, people with integrity that are out there chasing stories, do the, informing the world, you know, and helping us out.

Speaker 2:          00:34:31       Also they fuck you over if you don't do it, you can't read like 10 New York times article and they cut you off. Like, oh, you know, you have to subscribe. Yeah. Good for you though. You know what I mean? It kind of have to. I wish it was a little easier to do though is set it up with apple one click or some shit, you know, I think it is now. Yeah. It's kind of a pain. I don't get that. Why I subscribe to a few of them and if I go to the app, obviously everything's fine, but if I try to read it through another link, it's like, ah, you already subscribed. Know it's kind of annoying because then you got to jump into the app and then find the story again. And it's annoying. But I get it. I mean they have to figure out some way to generate a revenue and this whole, these last two years have been huge for the subscriptions on those. I mean Like grown by millions, you know, as, as print paper has gone down, those online subscriptions have gone way, way up. really? oh yeah, yeah. That's what they're profitable. Definitely. Definitely. I mean I just saw that whoever the editor in chief of a New York times

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       doing an art, an interview about their recent subscription model, it was impressive. I mean really went high. Well if you do good work, and I mean there's people out there that have a hunger for asheville, real journalism and also in depth intelligent, comprehensive understandings of what is happening. Like the real, real, a well researched take on a particular situation when somebody does it like that guy did about like the subprime mortgage, you know, and they spent all that time and they write that story. I mean it's like reading a good book. I just can't stop reading. I mean, did you read that dirty john story in the la times? What does that Man, and now they're making a, they have like a mini series coming out about it. I remember reading it and not being able to stop reading it and it was like an eight part series in the la times about this guy who was a sociopath who would go on dating sites and basically bait women who were like divorcees, who had some money.

Speaker 3:          00:36:44       He was posturing as a doctor and he would pretend to have this really successful life and just be a pariah that would like suck onto these people. And this story went really deep about how this guy found this woman. Her daughters were like grown daughters immediately suspected things were wrong. She didn't see it, but the story unravels the way, like a good book or like a thriller would, you know, would unravel and in the theater. So you're just like, like the guy, you know, he researched it, I forget his name, they turned it into a podcast and then now it's coming out as a, like a short series. That's the guy. That's the guy, that's the real guy. Wow. Christopher gafford and men. So it would be like part one in the series, you'd read this and you're like, all right, worst part. Like you're like scrambling to read the next.

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       That's freaking me out because he's moving images, moving slowly, slowly pulling away. Real guy. It's a fascinating read and I recommend reading it, man. I mean it is really good. So was this guy a career criminal criminal? He was a career crIminal that hit it well, but um, you know, it's interesting. I remember reading it and you're kind of fascinated how the daughters know, like they just know they keep going back to like, this doesn't add up, but she's kind of lost in the love and attention and exciteMent and this relationship and he's just praying on it. He Is preying on her. He empties her account. I didn't want to give it away, man. It's so good. It's so good. Yeah, you can get it right now. You just. Do you have a subscription or did you like it's a podcast, a bunch of articles about how big it got released and podcasts and la times. There's all sorts of stories about it. Well, there's still, I mean for all the people that are into just short attention span, clickbait nonsense, there's still

Speaker 1:          00:38:37       and there's some sort of a market for, for real, it's actually real real stories and real partners and I would say that that's what most of it is out there. It's just that we get the so much of. I mean there's such a stock pile of that stuff every day, but when it comes to the actual stories that you're reading, I don't know, maybe I'm pollyanna about it, but I feel like there's. There's a lot of great stuff out there. I think there's, there's plenty of great stuff. Can you think about the actual amount of content versus hoW much time you actually have to read? There is great stuff, but if you looked at the overwhelming appetite that people have for media, it's for nonsense. Like I was watching the wendy williams show. I've never watched that show before. She's christ. I of watching that show. First of all, there was a girl in the audience that had a crown on. It was hilarious. The audience alone, like he should have won. We should married herself. She wasn't done.

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       Tom and I were at a restaurant last night and the lady had just gotten married to herself. it was when we were both. We found out what's going on over there, and then someone was like, she's marrying yourself. this is your ceremony. Never seen guys doing that much in my. My oldest daughter went over and hugged her and grabbed my oldest daughter is the sweetest person in the world. Yeah. Yeah. She was like, she's so sweeT that the lady who married herself was like, your daughter is very sweet. She wanted to marry her. She was like, listen, I'm married to myself, but I'm you too. Let's marry everybody. Yeah. Um, but, uh, what were we just talking about? Um, what the wendy williams show. Oh my goodness. Was that when she fell down? Yeah, she had, she had a moment on the show. Have you seen them?

Speaker 1:          00:40:18       Have you seen the. What I saw when aretha died, that aretha had done an interview with wendy williams one time and it was fucking hilarious because aretha franklin was sassing her a bunch of like, oh gee, sassing. It was reaLly, really funny, man, I don't know if you've seen it, but she's just like, like a wendy's, like I have an idea for this project, whatever it was, and she was like, so you want to go in on it and a wreath is like, you're going to write a check? And she's like, I was thinking you coach. She was like, oh, you ain't got it. Huh? You ain't got the money. That's what I thought. She just turns around on her. it's so funny. Hilarious. Read the franklin just so just owns it, you know, she's been around. She was like not having it at all.

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       Well, all the show is wendy williams talking shit about people and all the girls in the audience and they're talking about people getting custody and all she breaking up with her and it's like, wow, that's what scares a lot of people out there that have an appetite for that. Uh, for sure. I mean, how long does me, obviously I sat there watching it, like who will look to help jerry springer state on the right look? Yeah. That was a fucking 30 plus year run or something. You know what's fucked up about that? Jerry sprInger is a smart guy. Yeah. He's a smart guy. I used to listen to them on the opiod anthony show. I was like, whoa, wait a minute. He was the mayor of cincinnati. Mayerson said he got busted paying for a prostitute with a check. So we all slip up from time to time. That's how he got caught. Yeah. We just hilarious. Like checking into county on that. Right. You wanted a lexus who's lexus?

Speaker 1:          00:41:56       Yeah. It's pretty crazy, man. It's a. I dunno. It's. I think there's plenty. What does that. Does that him? Wow. That's when he was the mayor. A young fellow. He's like 40 years old back then, but it's just bizarre how prevalent that stuff is online. I mean it's just, there's so much. There's so much click baity nonsense. It's hard, but there's, there's plenty of good journalism is plenty good writing. Yeah. Well, I mean, again, like I said, when when I was doing the, my, my limited experience in doing this, the vast, vast, vast majority of the people that I've been talking to have been really interested in just talking about adoption and really interested in foster care and all that kind of stuff and it's been great. It's been great talking, talking to everYbody and I think that when you have a topic like that too, it helps because they're not really trying to crush you as much when you're know when you're talking to them about kids who need families and homes and that kind of thing. Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah. They have to be careful With letting their piece of shit claws out.

Speaker 1:          00:42:58       Now you said that your experience with adopting three kids started out as a nightmare. yeah. How did it start out as it goes into it? You know, do you have friends that joined the military and where they, they're in high school, they think they're really tough and they were like, yeah, yeah, it's going to be awesome. And then they go to bootcamp and then they're like, oh shit, this is really hard. And then they get on top of it and then they're good again, you know. But they have to go through that transition of like, oh man, maybe I'm not as tough as I thought I was. And then they get tough. So you'd never had any kids. I never had any kids dog eat dog thing there. The dog thing. You to take care of a very small way. I had a friend who said that to me.

Speaker 1:          00:43:35       So I'm like, well I've had a dog. Oh yeah. Talking about having a kid. I'm gonna fucking kill you with a rock. Not compare the two. Yeah. And we know we, we went from, you know, zero kids and you kind of think, well I babysat my sister's kids and that kind of. How long that. Yeah, that's, that's the movie I went to a whole movie. Yeah. And even what happens is you go. So, so for us we had a really interesting experience where we went to an adoption fair and that's, that's in the movie. It's a real thing where they, because they, you know, their budgets are stretched so tight that they'll have these outdoor events, not every county has them, but la county has them where you, uh, where they'll bring a bunch of kids that are, that are in the system and a bunch of a prospective parents and they'll just have like games and stuff going on.

Speaker 1:          00:44:26       It's a really bizarre event. And we went, you know, and you're there to meet kids, you know, to meet your kids. And uh, so we went there and we didn't want to have anything to do with teenagers because that, you know, just because we were scared we thought were, were not ready for that. We just want to find like some little cute little kid, then we can, you know, help out. And uh, and then the teenagers are all off to the side because everybody is afraid of him and it's the most heartbreaking thing you've ever seen because they know why they're there. Like they chose to be there and they know that everybody's scared of him. So I was there and I was like, oh my god, this is the worst thing I've ever seen. And we ended up sort of inadvertently meeting this teenage girl and her brother and sister and just, they just seemed cool and they just seemed like really good kids and just scared, scared, scared.

Speaker 1:          00:45:13       But we wrote them down on our sheet and just again, not what we, what we had planned on when we did this, but we wrote them down on our sheet and we went home knowing they were going to match us with them because no one else was going to put them down. And we get home and we find out, yes, you've been matched with these kids. And we're like, okay, here we go. We're going to have, you know, we're going to have a temperature a, they were 16, 13 and 11. Yeah. So, so we're, we're kind of wrapping our heads around this over the next couple of weeks. And we got to a place where we were like, okay, you know, we can do this. And then we got a call from the social worker and she said, you know, um, it's not going to work out with them.

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       The, uh, they've been in the system for four years. The girl, she's really holding out hope that her mom is coming for. So she's refusing replacement. And so we tried to. And I was like, I was, you know, when you hear that, it's so, just the same reaction you guys just had. So my wife and I wrote a letter to send through the, the social workers just saying, hey look, we get it if you maybe you guys just want to come and just do the foster thing or you know however you want to do it. And we, we, we just sort of sent the letter off. We didn't hear anything. And then she came back and she just said, yeah, it's not gonna happen. And then she very matter of fact just said, but there's these other three kids. And that was kids are my kids now who I love more than anything in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       And that's, that's how just, there's these other three kids are like, oh, all right, and you, you want there to be, or I shouldn't say you. I mean, I wanted there to be a certain amount of randomness, like when you have biological kids, you don't know what you're going to get and go into that, that event where you're sort of like meeting kids and if it feels weird. And so when she said there's these other three kids, we said, okay. And then they turned out to be younger, you know, 63 and 18 months. Um, but I never forgot meeting that, that girl and her brother and sister. So when the, when the time came that we were going to make a movie about it, I really, that was the genesis of the lizzie character. I wanted to make sure there was a teenager in this movie because they're so misunderstood.

Speaker 1:          00:47:19       And in the process I went out and met with a bunch of families that had adopted teen girls and then met with a lot of those girls who, some of whom are grown up. And some of them are still, you know, uh, with their families and, and this is the thing, you know, the scariness that we're all talking about, everyone of these families that I met with just great stories, like amazing, great stories, like hard times, you know, try it, trying to make that connection and whatever. But, but everybody with the same story wouldn't have it any other way. Change our life for the better. Met these incredible kids. And uh, this is. Yeah. And now I'm yammering, but. Oh, how old are they now? How many years have you had them? Uh, aLmost seven years. So my son john, he just turned 13. My daughter's nine and my, my other son is eight.

Speaker 1:          00:48:08       And um, how, how long was it between the phone call? Like I had these other three kids. And you actually getting them in your house? Um, god, what was it? It was, it was a couple of weeks because there was weeks. That's it. Yeah. No, it wasn't long at all. But, uh, yeah, it was [inaudible] they called and they said we have these other three kids. And then, uh, and then there was going to be a meeting because they, they, they won't tell you much about the kids until, until they really sit down with you and then they kind of walk through like, here's, you know, whatever trauma, here's whatever, you know, kind of. And again, they don't fit in our case, they don't have all the information obviously on their past and they can kind of tell you like, here's how they came into the and that kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:48:50       So I wasn't able to go because I was, I was, I was at a work thing. And so my wife went to the meeting and I was like listening to it, you know, and that was on speakerphone in the meeting. And uh, and there was this one moment, you know, and she's telling us everything and there's this one moment where she slides the picture across to my wife says, here's a picture of them and there's this long pause. And my wife goes, oh, they're cute. But they didn't sound cute by the inflection in their voice. And you know, you're trying, you're trying not to be that guy, you know, what do they look like, you know, you don't want to be shallow about it. I'm sure kids are kids and you know, you're going to fall in love with them regardless. But you know, like you kinda everybody wants to think their own kids are cute, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       So it was funny. Then when I saw the picture, the picture was, it was just a weird bad picture of the kids. like my son who was six at the time, it looked like he was 11 and he looked like this. It was just the look on his face and whatever. Yeah. He looked hard at all and, and we go over to the house and these kids are adorable. So. Oh, so this is. Sorry I'm getting ahead of myself. So, so when you. So we have the meeting and we go, okay, we're going to go meet with them. And just to be clear, we didn't say okay because of the picture, because the picture was kind of like neither here nor there, you know, we were just like, all right, let's go meet these kids. So we go to the house and these kids are adorable and, and it's the weirdest thing ever because you go to this foster home where they live and you play with them for like two hours.

Speaker 1:          00:50:15       And when do you ever play with any kids for two straight hours? like actually actively play with kids, especially kids you've never met before. So It's exhausting and it's weird. And we touch on this in the movie that I was really scared when we were getting there because I wanted so much to walk in. See these kids well up with tears. No, it's for real. no, these are my kids. And just have that like cosmic connection moment. And that didn't happen at all. Like it's more weird. Right. So were you, I'm going to live with you. Yeah. And well the, the little kids are just kinda like this, you know, it's actually weird in the other direction. They're so used to kind of being passed around that they're just kinda like, oh, okay, who are these people, you know, and so we get in there and then the, the foster mom in our case was like a go to your mom and dad, and I was like, oh, don't do this, don't do that because it just felt so obtrusive to the kids, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       And so we would go there every day for five straight days. We would go there when the kids were off school and we'd, we'd go and play with them first in the backyard and then you take them to the park and then you take him to the park and he'd take them out for ice cream and you're just kinda like getting to know these kids that are strangers to try to change their names. Uh, yeah. first day, as soon as we walked in and I was like, no, we didn't do that. But a little one wouldn't even know though, dude. Yeah, that's true. That is true. That is true. No memory. A lot of people do. In fact, a lot of kids, a lot of older kids that sort of have that we'll want to change their name, not just a new fresh start. Yeah. That they'll just want to.

Speaker 1:          00:51:57       Yeah. Yeah. I don't have any experience with that, but I've heard that, that sometimes kids will choose to. Uh, there was uh, a young lady that was at the screenIng last night who was, who her picture is at the end of the movie and she's like, she's In Ireland getting her phd right now, this girl that was adopted out of foster care and she's, she's amazing. And, and she, she had chosen to change her name. Yeah. I mean, that seems like it would mean something now that I think about it, it just seems, you know, changing a name. Yeah. Especially as a teen, but I mean, I get it if you're saying like, I want to put everything in the past. Yeah. You want a fresh start. Really lock it down. This is the new me. My name's brian. I used to be number eight. I'm tWenty four now.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       Well, and that touches on something that is really difficult when you're doing this as an adoptive parent, is that you're trying to walk this line all the time where you know you, you need to claIm these kids for your own. You need to be the person who's like, you're with us like we're, we're, we're with you. We got your back. We're behind you like you, you, you need to do that. That's what these kids don't have. this thing that we all take for granted. We have these parents that love us no matter what knucklehead things we do, so you're trying to do that, but at the same time you're trying not to impose your world on them because they're coming into it with their own personality and their own culture or whatever it is that behind them. So you're always trying to kind of be careful and walk this line between just just completely

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       bring them in, but not trying to change them into who you are. Did thE six year old already have things he was really into or sports or activities or. Yeah, he was. Well, the funny thing is my son is really athletic and I'm, I'm really not so I know you guys are, but I'm, I'm so nomis and me especially, he's an acrobat. You saw what I was doing yesterday because an animal, but uh, but no, he's really athletic and he's just always been good with, with all of that stuff and it's funny for me because I wasn't that kid at all, but it's great for me because I'm like, he's able to do the stuff that I wanted so badly when I was little. I suckEd at sports and I so wanted to be good at sports and he's really good at it and it makes me.

Speaker 2:          00:54:07       What does he play? Well, he, whatever he plays, he's just tends to be pretty good at it. So he played flag football for awhile and he's playing lacrosse now and he's played soccer or lacrosse and football. We're just planning it with brendan schaub the other day. I had no idea how many people get knocked the fuck out. Playing lacrosse. Lacrosse is. Oh my god. Island man. Violent. We were saying like there's a difference between this, even in football, in that they're striking, each are allowed to. You're allowed to hit each other with the stick, but they're also striking each other with elbows to running in and they have the stick in their hand and they're elbowing each other in the face as the running. I mean, oh shit. It's a crazy amount of force that they generate. Oh yeah. And these kids are getting flatlined because I had dale earnhardt jr here that day on really nice guy.

Speaker 2:          00:54:55       Great guy. Suffered 12 concussions over a period of four years racing. Yes. And has some significant brain damage because of it that he had to go through therapy for to, to help them like to the point where he was walking and he had to hold onto things because his balance was so fucked up. He couldn't, couldn't just walk, couldn't get off the couch and walk to the bathroom. He had to hold onto like a table and a chair and hit him. Make his way through all of this from concussions. And you know what they're getting in lacrosse. So they're getting in football, it's all the same shit. Head trauma, head trauma. Yeah. So I'm a terrible parent.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       My kids go to a very nice school. It's a great school and we went to a football game the other day where the older kids are playing football and I'm just sitting there. All the other parents are having a good time and I'm like, brain damage, braIn damage. There's some brain damage. there's some brain. I'm like, jesus fucking christ. These are kids. They're kids running at each of the full clip, smashing it with Jordan falling to the ground and see the kid get up slow and hope put his hands on the ground. He's all fucked up. I'm like, this is crazy. Like I felt like people. I always felt like lacrosse because my, my high school had lacrosse too and I always felt like it was way crazier ones because I didn't know about it. And then I'm at the school and they have it. I'm like, this shit is. Because they have stiffness. Yeah. And they're just, oh yeah, of course. Yes. If you're a football player, you can become some herschel walker type character and become a baller. Yeah, that's true. But you got no shot if you're a lacrosse player. I love when they interview like all the guys, the nfl,

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       they're like, uh, the young guys to like, you know, all this evidence is that your lifespan is going to be way shorter and it's gonna be probably horrific at some point because of the impact of what you're going through playing football, you know, what did you think about that? The like, shit's worth it, man. This is awesome lifestyle. Nobody is like, you're getting some guys that you see retire early, which was unheard of 10 years ago. Guys. One guy came out, played his rookie year and retired, you know, you're getting guys early retirement. Um, some guys play, finish out a contractor up for a big contract and they're out. Yeah, that's happening. But there's still, you know, there's no shortage of guys were like, I'll take the guarantee whatever my signing bonuses and take some brain damage it. That's how our brains work. Our brains are designed to not have that kind of foresight and you get much older. Of course, young satisfy me now and I don't know what that is, but you can tell people, hey, whatever it is you're doing right now, this is really good at causing irreparable harm when like today. No. Well fuck it. You know?

Speaker 2:          00:57:28       Well, that's the same way we deal with climate change. Yeah. Literally the same thing. People were driving around with cars blowing smoke. I like, yeah, one day of every fucking fix it. There's going to be a real problem. You tell someone to be a real problem here on earth and like 300 years and they're like, that sucks. Whatever, whatever. I won't be here bro. Or even 40 years, sadly. Yeah. It will be like, there's also the issue is people that get a lot of head trauma that they get very impulsive and they, um, they don't make good decisions anyway. So even if you know, even if they could have the foresight, they probably would make good decisions. They're don't, they're not thinking rationally. And they did some study. What was that study jamie? We've referenced this before where they, um, they looked at kIds that play football literally from pop warner all the way through college and how many of them have ct? He really, oh, jesus chrIst. It's stunning.

Speaker 3:          00:58:24       See, I always felt like my, my point of view on it was always like, I played football fourth grade through high school, right. And I always just like men. That's why you're so fucked up. I know, I know, but I just feel like, you know, the, like you have definitely some big in a, in an amateur career, you have some, you can think back. Like, man, I got my bell rung a bell rung. I don't know. I mean probably, I mean here's the thing, in fourth grade and fifth grade you're like, that doesn't happen really. I mean kids were like, you know, walking up and wrapping up slowly. You, you're playing with kids who will eventually not play football even in sixth grade. So it starts to be, you might have like a stud on a team in middle school and still a bunch of guys that won't play in high school and in high school. Yeah, there's definitely some uh, athletes that stand out for sure. I mean those are the kids that will eventually go on, but you play teams are and there's weeks where you're just like, no one is

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       really good on this team, you know, and you'll have a game where you'll feel like, yeah, I mean there was a couple of, I've got a couple good hits and there was nothing really have impact and then something will stand out. Like you'll play a school that has like an allstate or all american player. You're like, holy shit, that guy fucking fucked me up bad. And, and you remember it. I mean I remember it to this day, some of those like really standout guys and you're like, that hit stuck with me, but that's once a year that you play that guy, right? Or that you remember a school that good and then if you don't go on to play in college really feels like kind of a, I don't know, a risk assessment where you're like, I didn't feel like that was, you know, do I have damage?

Speaker 2:          01:00:08       I don't know. But I mean, once you get into college, football is where I feel like that's where you're really playing with really good athletes. A friend of mine, a guy in his neighborhood, I'm a kid who was 21 committed suicide and he was a college player who was about to go into, into the pros. He was 21 years old really. And um, the uh, significant cte, like just really ravaged. He, every year a player played tackle football under the age, predicted the early onset of cognitive problems by two point four years in behavioral and mood problems by two point five years. Yeah. But there's a study. This is okay. Our study found that 211 players who diagnosed with cte after death, who played tackle football before age 12, suffered from cognitive behavioral and mood symptoms earlier than those players didn't start to play till after age 12.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       They're saying that, okay, study included 246 former players, 211 of whom were diagnosed with cte after death. That's insane. Blinn college, there's, there's definitely, there's no such thing as getting around real high impact hits. That's it. Those are all people that know how to play. They're all athletes getting rock. What they're realizing now is that subconcussive trauma is what's responsible for the majority of brain damage. What's subconcussive? You're not getting a concussion. Oh yeah. You just get rattled. Getting rattled where it's not even fucking you up, but over time, over time, that over and multiple hits that are just not. They're not knocking you out that just jostling you. You can always happen a lot. Yeah. Even get it from getting hit to the body. Right? When you get hit to the body and your head snaps back and you don't even get hit in the head and you're like throwing up and your head's all fucked up and you try and figure out what's going on.

Speaker 2:          01:01:58       It's because your brain's been moshing around inside of your head. Yeah. The thing that I remember too, the thing that stands out is when you. Because it's such thing as like bracing for a hit and then feeling it and you're like, fuck, but when you don't see someone coming. Oh yeah, that's like a fight. You know? You don't see a punch comIng. Oh yeah, 100 percent. Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's, it's dangerous. You guys are saving my child's life, right? I'm telling you right now. He's good. It's funny because I, I don't know that much about lacrosse. I had to actually like youtube lacrosse to be like, how did you some of the video? Because there's some videos of some fucking hits that we were watching the other day and brendan played lacrosse in college. He played lacrosse in college and football jesus, and then he fought in the ufc, so his brain looks like a walnut.

Speaker 2:          01:02:40       It's got to be man. You talked to him. You kind of know it's a, it's a crazy fucking sports. People would watch these guys just over and over again. These guys getting code, boom, boom. See that? I mean they're smashing each other. The impact is horrific. Oh look at that. Boom. This. These are strikes. This is like me kicking somebody in the head. This is, this is not much different than a kick in the head. You just bring them with an elbow, but the amount of force. so these guys getting kicked in the head with these helmets on and if you think the helmet is protecting your head, that shit ain't protecting anything. Boom. Look at that. Boom. All right, look, I don't know anything about this stuff, but I've thought for a long time. Hard helmets. Got to just make it worse, right? Well, it makes you more confident that you got slammed your head into somebody and then you don't realize how bad you're getting fucked up from that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:40       You know it's your head when you get hit in the head, even though you have a helmet on it, it's not going to crack your skull, your brain cells still subset. It's hitting you. You get serious punishment. Smashing around in there. You're all the connective tissue. It's like, oh, it's awful. It's awful. Boom. And this is coming from a guy who's probably seen. I probably see more people get fucked up than 99 point nine percent of the people that have ever lived in terms of like being there live. When someone got the fuck beat out of them, I probably see more people get the fuck beat out of him than almost anyone that's ever lived in history. It's probably a small handful of people that have seen more. Sure. So yeah. How many fights have you called? Hundreds. Thousands. Thousands. At least more than a thousand.

Speaker 2:          01:04:31       Probably 2,000. But then I've seen more. I've seen a bunch of live in. when I was competing I saw a bunch of people get fucked up. I mean it's just, I've seen it a lot. It's that when you can avoid that, avoid it, you know, especially something like lacrosse, you can't, can't make a career out of it, like, get out of there because they actually just started because right now I'm used to like kids soccer where they're just running around chasing the ball. It's cute. It's fun. It's fun to watch. And uh, and yeah, my son just got into lacrosse and we play catch with the lacrosse stick and it's great. We, we have a good time playing catch with it. But no, I haven't seen him getting about tennis, men's soccer, even soccer. Which you think you know like who? Who's getting hurt in soccer?

Speaker 2:          01:05:11       Soccer from heading the ball, just heading the ball. The ball flying at you, hit it with your head. Soccer are suffering from cte to the point where they're starting to minimize the amount of heading they do in practices. Really? Yes. This is what we're finding out about brains like this is, you know, there's a good friend of mine, Dr. Mark Gordon who specializes in cte. He deals with a lot of soldiers coming back and a lot of them that are like my friend andrew marr where they would blow open doors so they'd set up a charge on a door and step back and break the door. Blow these guys. I mean he didn't even get hit with anything or maybe I add like that are nearby. Those guys suffer significant brain damage and it's just from the impact of just getting shook by an explosion. Not even anything actually hitting them in the head.

Speaker 2:          01:06:02       Which high school sport as the most concussions. Is it soccer girls, soccer girls, soccer. Cheerleading had rates seen at boys football by 2015. Wow. I know when you stop and you look at those, uh, like when they're going to commercial and the college game and they throw that grew up in the air and you're like, man, to get that right. I saw a documentary, but it's one of the most dangerous sports. Sure. This is high school cheerleading because they do, these girls fall on a gym floor. I just smack their heads on the floor. It's crazy. There's a, there's a, um, breakdancing, instagram page called stance elements. Jamie pullups dance elements is a guy who looks like he's about 300 pounds and he break dances. He leaps forward and lands on the top of his head and keeps his feet up in the air. I don't know how the fuck this guy did this. This guy's bigger than burt. Really? Yeah. Maybe not as big. Bird committee is pretty big and he leaps forward and he's lands on his head. No hands lands on his head with his feet up there and holds the position for like a silent second is preposterous. And when you can do that trick, you look at this guy, whoa. Yeah. Well, the size of them, oh my gosh, this. Give me some via

Speaker 4:          01:07:19       that guy.

Speaker 2:          01:07:20       We'll need a disc replacement within the next month

Speaker 2:          01:07:27       is so much weight on your fucking head. He's probably so dizzy and he's playing it all. Yeah, no shit bro. Look at that. Oh, I got to tell you, you guys are making me feel so good about my mostly sedentary lifestyle that I've lived my whole life. It's safer. You're definitely don't. Don't hit your head at this is coming from somebody who watches people, get their head hit for a living. I'm feeling really good now. Usually I feel more ashamed for the way that I've been conducting myself. It's just when you can avoid it. I mean, look, it's not a bad way to make a living. If you want to be a fighter and you really want to do it and that's your drive, that you should do it, but you should really learn how to defend yourself correctly and learn the right technique, but when you're doing it for recreation and you're doing something like the cross where running at each other full clip and smashing into each other, and that's within the rules like I think we're operating on ancient information.

Speaker 2:          01:08:23       That's what I think. I think most of these systems that they're setting up most of these, these sports rules and a lot of the organizations, they're all operating on these old ideas of brain damage. That's why I'm freaking out when I'm going to this school football game and I'm watching this, I'm like, like this is just brain damage and brain damage and then watching it. That's promoted by a school and school pride. Yay. Everybody go, yeah, yeah, yeah. We're playing another team. Let's hope we beat them. How do you going to beat him? You're going to fucking slam into them, give them concussions and going to go to school and they can't count. Do you get blowback for talking about that stuff or from fans and that kind of thing? No, it's true. Yeah. I really, I mean, I'm sure there must be some blow back.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       I don't read it anyway, but it's got to be true. I mean, it's just too much evidence. I just think you choose wisely choose. They don't not take risks. I mean if you really want to be a bmx rider or a professional skateboarder, you're going to take some knocks. It's just part of the part of the program. Just don't, don't do it if you don't have to. Yeah, because it, it piles up and there's no coming back. You know, when you, when you go in, you have like significant brain damage. I mean, you can get therapy, they can help you. It can, but you're, you're gonna, you're gonna be a road, you're going down. It's your brain.

Speaker 3:          01:09:43       I know they see the, the. I mean hbo is actually tapped into it a lot with that real sports show for years now. They've been doing follow up pieces on cte and men. It is devastating to see some of those guests. Those guys are like in their fifties or sixties and they're not there at all.

Speaker 2:          01:10:04       Dude. I put a video up on instagram or on twitter or retweeted it and it's boxers where it shows the boxers when they're young and they're talking and then it shows them like at the end of their career they're retiring. And then In the interview them and you see them, like, just completely gone, like a shell

Speaker 3:          01:10:21       interview with riddIck bowe really bad. Oh, it's awful. And I remember even at this one was actually kind of funny. Was a james tony.

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       Hm.

Speaker 3:          01:10:35       Because he was, hE was, uh, It was towards the end of his fighting and he was definitely at least 40 pounds overweight, right? Like really out of shape but still throwing bombs and he was sparring and it was like that piece that they air right before the fighters go to the ring for the, on fight night. And I mean he's definitely taken some shots and given some shots, but he was sparring and they were throwing in fresh bodies for him to spar against. So it was like, you know, two mInutes with this guy. And then boom, fresh body and as he's lIke, he is like really hyperventilation spit and

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       he's still talking shit like at, as he's fighting, he's like blah blah. And just. And then they bring in the guys like your mom, he just, he's a mess. It looks like a total mess, but he's just like talking shit, calling guys shit. Like as he's barely making it through these, these sparring sessions and you know, I mean he, he needs. But he's one of those guys he had to fight. He had to fight. Well, especially towards the end of his career, he took a fight in the ufc. He did? Yeah. Yeah. He's the only like real world champ

Speaker 2:          01:11:53       peon boxer that ever fought in mixed martial arts and the ufc and randy couture ankle picked him, took him down, strangled them right away. Yeah. It was easy. Yeah. I mean there's just, you know, he, I don't even think he really bothered learning talking to tony. I think he just put the gloves on and got In there and just had no idea what to do. When randy got ahold of him, he was clearly untrained when it came to the gravity of this low ankle, low single. I mean this is the beginning of the fight. Randy just immediately mount some punches him in the head a bunch of times and then strangled them and you know, randy was just honestly being nice. Really? Yeah. He could have punished them a lot longer if you want it to. He just wanted to finish them up. It was sad because it was just, it, you know, he was talking about all these guys just don't know how to handle his hands and every fight starts standing up and which is true.

Speaker 2:          01:12:48       But randy coture will take you down all day anytime he wants. And then he got him in an arm triangle, just smushed them. I mean, even when he's punching him, he's not even hitting him that hard here. He's just trying to force them to give something up. That's what he wants. He wants his head tied down against the side of his arm and he's going to squish them. And as you tap, that's it. It's wrap. didn't take apart. It was pretty quick. That was pretty fast. And james, tony's one of the best that ever did it a phenomenal boxer, but just need.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       I talked to a lot of shit. It was shit talker. Yeah. So I don't want to discourage you, but. No, no, no. this is you show your son. So these videos, because we're out in the backyard playing catch, it's just like a slice of America. They're not even thinking about this. People operate not totally aware of consequences and they make choices that will affect them for the rest of their lives. Yes. That's what I mean. I love my job. I mean you guys are kind of like, I'm having that feeling right now because I love my kids so much. I think. Oh wow. Basketball? Yeah, he does. Yeah. Basketball's a great support. Yeah. There's no no contact and guaranteed contracts, man. if you mentioned the best, how tall is he? Not tom. Yeah. Okay. What about baseball? It's another one. Baseball. Baseball is the bomb. Diggity. As long as you only hit a bit of pitch,

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       you'd hit with a pitch that than that. That's the lifestyle, man. I don't know if I'm allowed to do this here, but while we're here I really wanted to talk about how tom got into this movie and we talk about that. What do you mean allowed to just like totally like, you know, jump, jump tracks like that and just throw in rules podcast. Yeah. How did he get into this? How did I get into this? So, so I, I saw stand up and I thought I thought it was really funny and we had already written a draft of the script and I was like, oh man, this guy would, would be a great russ. And I didn't really think too much about it because we were making another movie at the time. And then when it came back around we were talking about, you know, just talking about different people that you're going to cast and you get these boards up and see your picture was actually on a board for a while.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       Wow. I don't think you even knew that. I didn't know that picture was on a board. I did not know that. And uh, so then, um, so tell it from your angle when you got the call though, because I'll tell you this, so I didn't know if you, I don't even know if you know this, that I passed on the audition. I do, yeah. Yeah, a good. So when they, you know, for people like when you're, if you're a star, you get calls that like you have an offer, right? Like you want this off, do you want to do this movie? But if you're just working, trying to get booked, you get these emails. Usually it's an email followed by a call that says like a, for your consideration, um, movies called family. Uh, sean and there's, John Morris wrote it. It's uh, you know, the part is russ and it has like all the, you know, mark walberg agreed to play this in rose byrne is attached to play this and then here's the sides.

Speaker 3:          01:15:55       And it was like one of those things where it'll say, you know, so thursday at 11, 15:00 AM, you are confirmed for the audition and I get that email like on a monday. And I was like, I just got back from the road, I'll say I've got a podcast today. I was like, whatever. And then I just don't even read any of it. So then it's like, you know, tuesday and then something happens and we're busy at the house and then went and then they go here, we're just following up that you're good for the audition tomorrow. I get that like on wednesday, you know, just confirming that you'll be there. And I were like, nah, like that's a pass, like I'm not going to be there. And that was it. I just sent that off. Like I'm just not doing that this week. And then I get a call right away and it's my agent, he's like, hey, uh, I noticed that you trying to make money off.

Speaker 3:          01:16:41       I noticed that you're not going to, you said no. Is there a reason? Did the, uh, what did they say? There's always that phrase, did you respond to the site? Did you not respond to the material, the material? And I go, oh, I haven't even read it. And they go, well why aren't you reading it? I was like, because and I just kind of lay out my week. I'm like, I've had this, I've had this with my kid, I traveled, I'm doing this. I just got a lot going on. And they're like, he's like, okay, I go. So like, it's not personal. I think like he's taking it personal. I go, I'm not saying no to upset you, I just have these things. And he's like, okay, well the director specifically requested that you audition and like, as you know, that doesn't happen a lot with you.

Speaker 3:          01:17:27       So like do you want to reconsider? And I was like, yeah, hold on. I go. He asked me, he's asking for me to be like, yeah, and I go, did you believe him or did you think it was relating you? I did. I did believe him because I mean he's never said that. And um, you know, a lot of times I've done things with like the producers are in the room on this session or that stuff. And I go, okay, well here's the deal man. I'm not going to go in unprepared. So because now it's like the auditions in 24 hours, so I go, I'll do it, but you have to buy me a couple more days because I'm like, I have this the rest of today, like I'm not going to do it tomorrow morning. And he was like, okay, I'll see what I can do.

Speaker 3:          01:18:06       And then he called me back. He's like, they said they're good for monday or whatever, and I was like, great. So and then I, then I tried to prepare for that, like, you know, because they told me the director requests. I was like, I can't go into this thing half fast. So then I'm like really trying to prepare for that and then I go in there and it was you, you're on skype. well okay, so here's what happened from my end because you didn't show up. Show up. I had to go back to atlanta. And so then we had to do the audition via skype. What I see, I didn't know that. That's brutaL for it. Everybody else, because you didn't show up, but who organize it? What kind of nonsense agency are you with that they booked you something and don't tell you that they book?

Speaker 3:          01:18:50       well, they always do that where they'll just book it. No, they'll, they'll, they'll set up a time, right? Like it's very common. will they'll go 11:00 AM 11:00 AM your agency? Yes. Now they must have nothing to do with your podcast then nothing. That's the problem, right? Yeah. So they don't know what you're booking. So they just think that that takes precedent. They also will be like, hey, you have an audition friday and I'm like, when I'm in philadelphia and they're like, you're in philadelphia. Is there any way you can move that agency for your standup as well? Oh christ. Is there any way you can move that? They really fucking say that. Oh yeah. They had an agent tell you, let me call these 5,000 people that are waiting. I had an agent, I had an agent go, like, why don't you just, um, oh, it was about like bookings on booking.

Speaker 3:          01:19:33       And I was like, when does it shoot though? Like if I booked this, when does it shoot? And it was like this, you know, October 3rd or whatever. I'm like, oh, but I'm in sacramento. And he was like, just move that. And I was like, yeah, but it's to theater shows. It's like 5,000 people. And he was like, oh really? I'm like, yeah, like you think I just got to. Yeah, just move It aside. And he's like, I'm like, why don't you know that my calendar is public? Just look it up man. But yeah, they'll give you answers like that. So she quit acting. It's should make this movie, this movie is going to be awesome. Make it your

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       swan song, bro. A lot of people are saying it's the breakout performance of the year. I don't know if You've heard of crackle, their resume, If they do whatever they do. Well, so I'm in, I'm in atlanta, atlanta, thank you. And uh, I. And he, he additions via skype and what I saw his standup, I was like, this guy is perfect because we want this guy to just have this kind of swagger and this confidence. But he can kind of say these jackasses things, but just sort of own them. and I'm like, this guy, this guy's perfect for this. I keep saying this guy because I didn't know him at the time. And uh, so tom comes in and I watched the skype audition, now I'm going to shit talk you a little bit here and a. And he was not good. He was so not like, like who he is.

Speaker 1:          01:20:51       Like he came in and he kind of was like sort of putting us back into it a little bit. Like he was kind of like really just trying to be kind of like really sort of extra funny and it was just not at all what I had in mind, but I just was like, so I, so I'm watching it skype and I'm just. So I'm, I'm trying to give, you know, somebody that you weren't good and I have, I had no idea what, what, whether it. Here's the thing, everY audition, this is actually fascinating if you audition because you literally leave auditions and you go, sometimes you go, that was great and you'll never hear anything again. Sometimes you go, I bombed, and you get a call. Hey, guess what? They want to see you again. Are you like, you don't know what they want?

Speaker 1:          01:21:30       No idea. You have no idea. I don't really know what they want when you're going in. I did not know that. It sucked that bad. I didn't know that. It didn't know it wasn't that it that it sucked that bad it. It might've been. No, no it wasn't. No, it was just that you, you have this very specific thing that you do that I wanted to bring in and be a part of this character. And you left that out. See I. But I don't think. What's that thing? It's like he's got this, he's got this in his delivery. This kind of devil may care. Kind of like dead pan sort of, but it's this, but it's, it's, it's like a big part of your persona is this whole like, all right, whatever. I just said that. okay. And I, I wanted russ to have that thing. And when you came into to audition, you left that thing out. I think I did that in the movie. Not at all. No. You were great in the movie. No, I'm saying I feel like I did the movie exactly how I audition. No, you didn't at all really know. It was like night and day. Really. Night and day.

Speaker 1:          01:22:28       In my mind if you, if someone were to ask me, I'd be like 100 percent of the sentence. the second audition you did just like the movie. Really? Yeah. Because basically so, so then what happened is we got together and I thought and I was like, god, I don't want to meet him for the second audition. Well then what? We got together because I called them because I really wanted him to be at the movie and I called him and I said, would you be willing to come over to my house and we can just talk through it and work through it. A little desk. That's what harvey weinsteIn shit. I made jokes about that. I made jokes about that immediately to him on the phone. I was like, am I going to give you a bath? He was like, all right, can I tell you I got to go back.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       This is more embarrassing. I remember leaving that audition that now you're telling me this, the first one and tell my agent like there's no way I could've done better. I did tell him that. I was like, there's no. I could not. I don't, I can't imagine. Dude, I'm serious. That's the thing. I, I understand that because you have energy and you were funny, but you just didn't have that thing that I wanted so badly to be a part of this character. And, and so it was, there was this one thing that was missing and then you came over and we talked about it and then you did it. And then also we got the chance to. Because we didn't, when he read it, he's just reading dialogue that we wrote for anybody. But then once you, once you have somebody's voice in your head a little bit, you can adjust it and make it a little more comfortable.

Speaker 1:          01:23:49       So we, we, we made some adjustments to the dialogue and everything which made it more conducive to your style of speaking cadence. Yeah. Yeah. That was fun. And uh, yeah, it was. And so then he comes back and he does it again and he crushed it and he was really funny and we sent that to the studio and they were like, oh my god, this guy's great. And it was like such a no idea. I have no idea. That's kind of what I wanted to talk about this on the podcast because I knew you didn't know all. I definitely didn't know that. I definitely didn't know that. It's actually like, it's, it's the thing though, like if that's the big bummer about in general auditioning is you walk out and you go, sometimes you follow up with your agent and you're like, what? So what's the feedback?

Speaker 1:          01:24:29       And they're like, ah, they look, they always, they always tell you they loved you and you're like, is there anything else you don't know? Like was it good, was it bad? And you also don't know what they're looking for. And I don't know. I mean go into your place. I'm going over like, you know, in detail more is also like, I actually felt like I won a contest because you audition now I know I tanked. And then the directors like do you want to come work on it so that like possibly you can do it better? And I was like sure man. So I'm, I'm working with him on this thing and I don't know, we spent a lot of time working on it and then when I found out I booked the role, then I go there and I feel like it's a second part of the contest because like he has all great actors in the movie.

Speaker 1:          01:25:14       Like for all of the parts. I mean you know the stars, but like margo martindale from the american. You're watching americans know that shows. You've seen her though. She's amazing. She's amazing. She's one heard that shows awesome. That shows so good. I mean it just ended. But like if you ever want to go on a binge weekend, now you have like six seasons I think to go through and she, I, I became a big fan of hers on that. And then julie haggerty and you have like all these great actors. So every time spencer take notaro we had like really good. Every time we're shooting a scene with one of the, with one of them, I ended up just watching them like I'm in the scene and I'm just like, wow, she's a really good actor. That's weird, isn't it? Yeah, totally is. I did a scene with maura tierney once when I was on newsradio. Maura tierney is definitely one of the best actors I've ever worked with, but she was so good that she did the law. We're were rehearsing, doing all this things. She did the lion in the scene and I didn't realize that it was the lion from the scene. I realized she was just talking. I thought she was just talking because of how like she's so natural. I was like, that kind of creeped me out. I was like, oh, oh, that's the line.

Speaker 1:          01:26:24       That was weird. yeah, totally normal. Right? Because otherwise people like tom, where are we going to find a guy that's going to fix that? So forth. She had none of that because she was really an actor before she was. I would just say some of them don't like to be called actresses. Right? yeah. So it's safer to say actor, but it comics could see who the fuck uses comedian remember that? That went away. I didn't know that doesn't exist anymore. You know about the latin x thing. I didn't know that was the thing. We didn't know about that. What do you mean? I was reading this article and yeah, it's and latina are male and female. Gender specific. So the, And the word latin also get, gets it done as far as. Yeah, I dunno. Yeah. So it's supposed to be like that's how you latin x, you should say that you're supposed to say latinex because it's just new.

Speaker 1:          01:27:24       It's not, it's a couple years in the making and fuck off. We'll see in spanish. the masculinized version of these words just considered gender neutral, but that obviously doesn't work for some of us like myself. And so I think it's appropriate to assign a masculinity as gender neutral when it isn't. So I'm latinex well it's interesting because my kids are latin and this is another one of the things that we touch on to next. Yeah, there it is and we touch it. Oh, sorry, go ahead. No, go ahead, please. Well, we touch on this a little, not this pronunciation or you know, but we touch on that a little bit in the movie of there is that feeling, you know, when, when we went in to adopt our kids, we were just open. We were like, look, we're, we're, we're pretty general age wise, we didn't go in expecting three kids.

Speaker 1:          01:28:10       Just, you know, we thought one and it sort of turned into that. But uh, but you know, you're open to it and you're just there and they ask you, well, what about ethnIcity? You know, and just go, yeah, whatever, you know, wherever the need is, whoever needs parents let us know. And, but then when, when it happens and your kids in my, in my case, my kids turned out to be latin, then you have the, you know, you start to kind of think about like, oh, well, you know, uh, is that, is that okay? Is that gonna? Is that gonna look like the white savior thing? Is that going to look weird? Is that am I, am I saying things right? And whatever. And what ends up happening is this really wonderful thing where your family becomes this melting pot where, you know, at first, because of the, the, the times that we live in right now, it is, it's a little scary jumping into that because thinking about what you know, but you're, you know, but you ultimately are just going to think about who the kids are, what their need is and how wonderful they are and, but you.

Speaker 1:          01:29:11       But all of those things come up and that's the kind of thing that wouldn't even be, you know, why would that the, the latinex thing have anything to do with my house. Well now it does. Yeah. So I've got, I've got all that, you know, all the time. And, and uh, I actually find it really interesting latinex thing. No, no, not that specifically, but just that, that my family is now this little melting pot. Yeah, that part's cool. And it's cool. I reject latinex completely. Well, it is, it is cool. But it's also very strange that that is a. And it would be a real point of concern, like you would worry about how do I handle this new culture without cultural appropriation, how do I, how do I bring my kid and embrace the latino or latina culture? Like what do I, how do I handle that?

Speaker 1:          01:29:58       Yeah. Yeah. And how do we do it without getting called a racist? Right. And it gets back to what I was talking about before where you're trying to just put your kids' needs first and just deal with them as children, as individuals, as human beings, you know, and, but at the same time you're also, you're with other parents and there's in the adoption community and really in every direction, there's mixed race families and the adoption community and uh, and you're kind of learning from them. And it just, I don't know, it just, it opens up a lot of conversations with your own kids and, and just the movies. You watch the foods you eat sometimes. And I, I don't, I think it's great. No, it's great. I think it's really, you know, the, uh, the language thing, for me, it stands out more because my whole life I've said latIno, like my mother's latina and it's just funny to me to speak spanish.

Speaker 1:          01:30:46       He speaks fluently, which is hilarious because tom has some great stories about people not thinking he speaks spanish because when you look at them you're like, oh, this fucking american guy. It looks like a regular american guy. but he speaks perfect. I've been around him before when he asked people questions, like, oh, I forgot you could do that. Yeah, yeah. It's like someone who, you know, they could do backflips, right? Just do a backflip, be like, oh, I forgot you could do that. Yeah, it's true. And that throw it throws people off because you look so american. Yeah. And that, you mean you look like a guy. I mean if you have a guy who loves football, like it's still fucking american, a regular american, but he speaks perfect. He rOlls the. When you go. Even when I travel abroad to spanish speaking countries, even there, even though spanish speaking countries are also melting pot different, they still look at you like, oh shit, look at this motherfucker. It's really throws people at the most. The craziest one wasn't even with me and my sister who, one of my sisters who also speak spanish, uh, went to the naval academy's linguistics center, so in the navy and she was in the navy for awhile and she learned mandarin and it was really, really

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       intense. And we went to a restaurant together and the guy who was one of those, like a benihana tight where they chop stuff up and the guy was a, someone asked like where he's from and he said somewhere in China and she started speaking mandarin and he dropped the thing and he was like, he saw a ghost and she's spitting back to them and pretty fluent mandarin and he stops. And he was like, I've never seen this before. And he's like, I've never seen a white person do this. And we were like, yeah, pretty, pretty wild. And then he turned us. He goes, I don't think you understand how hard it is to speak this language, and I was like, I have a pretty good idea, I can't do it.

Speaker 3:          01:32:42       And then just watching it, he was just like, he couldn't even start cooking except your sister to learn. Um, well she was in. When you sign, when you get into like that naval institute program, they have you going, I think it was something like eight hours a day, five or six days a week. So it's really, it's super into, it's almost like learning mandarin. Yeah. And it overwhelms people. People drop out almost like in a physical stress way, you know, some people just can't handle the camp like bootcamp and I forget how long she was in and you know, she didn't reach the level of I'm super fluent, like we're speaking english, but she was able to communicate in mandarin. Can she read it? She was reading and writing. That's the thing is she was telling me one time about how many characters and you know, it was just unbelievable and like there's sounds for expressions like I'm going to screw up [inaudible] I don't remember it, but she was like, you can do something like, oh, and that means like means an actual phrase, you know, like there's so many and that, uh, that there's characters that mean entire expressions as well, that I was like, this is just, our brains are so married to our alphabet and way of speaking that it's a real jump to, to learn that, you know, it's just, it really is fascinating when you travel and you listen to people speaking their native tongue and you realize how strangely different languages are across the entire planet.

Speaker 3:          01:34:15       Just unbelievable. I was in Thailand thIs summer and you listen to people talk, tie and everything. Everything stretches. It's got like a stretch to it, you know, it's like a weird. It's very odd language. I'm like, compare that to like german or dutch, like the germans got those hard sounding really hard.

Speaker 3:          01:34:38       it's like this weird difference. Yeah. And the latin one, latin root word, like languages all do have a flowy singing sounds kind of nice to listen to the language. That's really nice. I've met like listening. I don't speak portuguese. I like listening to it. Yeah, brazilian portuguese is amazing. Sounds so cool. And I listened to. We listened to french music sometimes at home. Just in the kitchen. Yeah. Yeah. Like cooking or something. I don't know. What the hell are you saying? I like it when I write. I listen to spanish music when I write because I have no idea what they're saying. I did that to you listen to music in a foreign language so that it doesn't. It doesn't. It doesn't distract. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, it sounds good. It gives me a little something, something. But I can still think about the exact things that I'm thinking about.

Speaker 3:          01:35:19       Well, I recently had this interesting experience. I sent you one of them that, you know, the trailers for the movie get a. Oh yeah. The movie itself and the trailers get dubbed into all kinds of different languages. So you have this dialogue that, that I wrote or meeting town road or whatever, and you get to hear it in these different languages and I sent you the Spain spanish because that's different and I don't really, I'm not going to pretend that I understand that much. What the difference between the, between it is. But that's predominantlY what you speak, right? No, no it isn't. No, not mother What I speak predominantly it was just like specifically south american and more specifically a peruvian. Okay. All right, great. So, but I mean I did study, I studied in madrid for six months and once your, your ears are trained to it, you can listen to someone say a sentence and know that it's, oh, that's from Spain.

Speaker 3:          01:36:09       Like, that's, that's really interesting. Then there's the cuban version of it, which is crazy. Yeah. Version of the way they, all the island dialects sound dramatically different, you know, like if you listen to somebody from Cuba, puerto rico, is it a comparison like english speakers from America versus english speakers from Ireland? [inaudible]? It is, yeah. Um, and I would say, you know, I always think of Spain as like our britain, you know, in a way like the language properly english is from england. That's where the language, that is, how you speak it spanish and a guest to yet castilian that comes from Spain. They're speaking oji spanish and then it all kind of came over here and it's influenced and every country has different ways of saying things different. Obviously different slAng, um, all different curses, all different expressions, completely different. Even words like as simple as like to pick up, you know, go ahead, pick something up.

Speaker 3:          01:37:11       You know, you say that in Mexico or Argentina, it literally means to fuck. So really? Yeah. So if you're like know cuticle hair style, like you're trying to, you're saying like, I want to fuck this water? Yeah, but I'm going to fuck this bottle. yeah. My mom told me that she was In a, in Argentina, like when her youth and traveled there and was with a bell hop and she was like, go ahead man, I'm on. Which is like, pick up that suitcase. But he was like, okay, because she was basically in slang saying fuck my suitcase, you know, so it's just. But like, there's like, there's also like severity of words, like hold aid is the word, like there's so many ways to say fuck you, of course, in every language. But khaled in Spain is like saying fuck. It's like going like, oh fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:38:02       But like when you say it in Peru, nomi has, it's a, it's a softer. It's not taken as severely. So it's not, it's not read the same way. You're not saying you're saying, uh, uh, like you're complaining, but you're like, I don't. It's like, it's taken as like, oh, don't mess with me, you know? So like, even when I would say when I would go to Spain, they were like, damn, you curse a lot. And I was like, really? And then they, you know, we went over that one and then like six months later they were like, you actually do curse a lot all the time. And I was like, yeah, that's probably right. Do you do stand up in spanish when you. I've done bits and stories were like, I involve both english and spanish, but I haven't done theirs. There's a show now I'm here in la that they're doing a thing that even at the stores had it like once where, uh, some of the spanish speaking comics here, um, have done like a full show in spanish here in la.

Speaker 3:          01:39:01       Francisco ramos of felipe. I did it as far as uh, um, well, what's the other guy? Torres. joey do it. I don't know if joey did it. Joe used to do spanglish and in miami he would do cuban spanish plus english and it was impossible to follow because of the audiences were, there's so many cuban people in the audience and he would hit punch lines in spanish and people would literally just throw chairs through windows and jumped through the cla people where he would crush. So I middled once in miami. And did you know, you used every trick and to get through the sex. It's such a chaotic club because I wasn't saying it was totally insane and I was doing stuff and talking to this lady. I would, I would, you know, I would hit a punchline in spanish and then say something back to this guy's spanish, then go back to english, do like your best bit and then something else is spanish and it was so crazy for me at the time, like I never experienced a 20 minute set like that, that the guy, the headline or after we did 35 minutes and split like he was just like a good night because it was, he was a white guy and was like not know what's happening once they got that flavor.

Speaker 3:          01:40:13       Yeah. Because it was like, it's the most. I mean that, that room that didn't hold that many people had like 300 I think last I think probably less, maybe like 75 or something and it had like, you know, they were haitians in there, colombians, cubans, puerto rican. But I mean it was such a mix of people and they, if you start giving them a little bit of flavor. Yeah. And they let people in there that were like 18 to 18 people in with guns and all kinds of people. It was a the miami improv. It was the the worst club to work. They're reopening in a new location. Good luck. Yeah, too late. I dunno. I know. That was a.

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       What was it that was coconut grove and now they're opening I think in doral, in miami. Just so crazy. It's such an interesting place. It's so different than any other place. I did miami right before I did my netflix special and they were using those yonder bags. We had to put your cell phone into yonder bag so you couldn't use it while you were inside the store, so you know what they did. You could leave the room and use the yonder bag. Right. So these, the entire set, it was the only place where the entire set people just kept coming and going. They just kept leaving and coming back there was so many people doing it and it might've been like dozens of people at any point in time walking around, coming and going to, going outside to get to use their phone and then coming back in like it was chaos.

Speaker 2:          01:41:36       The phone thing. I don't know that there's a real good solution yet, but I did the yonder thing in new orleans and that place wasn't too big, but it was, it was still. You could tell like, you know, it's inconvenient for them. It's a, it's a long thing to go thRough that, but then you're like, then you have people coming and going in and out of the showroom because they want to use their phone. It's a fucking nightmare, but if they don't, if they just sit there and just tune into the show, it's great. It's like 10 percent better. I think so too. Yeah, but it's hard. It's hard to impose that on people too and a surprised when people don't know. They're like, I'm doing what with my phone man. Going to put it in a bag. It's still going to be on you and you can use it as long as you leave this room.

Speaker 2:          01:42:19       They're like, out of, no man, I need to check my phone every 18 seconds. Yeah. I had to let people know, but there's some people that just want to film everything to, you know when you get on stage, you see people just stand there while you're doing your set and they're holding a phone up you and you're like, this is. You're making this whole thing so much weirder. Yeah. Do you understand what you're doing? You're basically like a tmz guy at the airport, like they're watching a show, like holding it up in front of them like they're not even looking at for comedy too. I went to of all things a daddy daughter dance with my daughter and it was the weirdest thing. Every guy was dancing with their little kids like this and I realized, I realized that why they were doing it. It wasn't about the moment, I mean a little bit, but it was more about that that if you have that phone out and you're looking at that screen and you're doing that, it sort of keeps everything else out.

Speaker 2:          01:43:13       It makes you feel like you're having this little moment instead of having to be this awkward thing of like you're dancing in front of these other grown men. I think it's done. Honestly. I think you're just trying to capture these moments. You know, you're, you're painfully aware that they're only going to be six for a year. Yeah. but not all night. You know what I mean? Because that's the problem is that you wind up as a parent, you wind up with all this video that you, that you're never going to watch because it's. But you're thinking logicAlly. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe people aren't. They're just collecting video, you know, they're just collecting their, like hoarders. Well, the thing that made me think of it though is that I was more comfortable when I had the phone on. I was like, oh yeah, because I like, I'm doing something, like I'm not just dancing, like if I'm just doing this thing I'm doing like a, like a parental kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          01:43:58       I'm just documenting my cute kid. But then when I put the phone away I felt a lot more exposed. But like, okay, why? I thought it was painful for everybody that dance doing my ah, it's, oh, it's terrible. and every guy there had the same, had the same feeling, I'm sure. So. But I was just like, nope, I'm not going to do it. I'm putting my phone away. This is stupid. And tell you what though, man, you go back and look at those videos from when your kid was really little and it does freak you out. Like they're, they're really valuable. Powerful videos. Yeah. Videos of your kids when they're really young. They're so, there's a video of my daughter when she was, she was wearing a diaper, I think she was probably just a little over one and we're walking through the airport and I'm pulling a, uh, one of those little roller bags and she's, she's behind it, pushing it.

Speaker 2:          01:44:46       She liked to push it on her legs like that tall and a little diaper butt and me pushing this thing and we tell her, hey, we're going to go to a toy store. And she's like, oh. And she puts her hands together and she pushes the bag in. But it's like the most adorable. My watched that video hundred times easier. Yeah. It's like that video will forever be stained in my brain. That's crazy mode. We've got these videos too. There's an inch. There's a really interesting thing. We were starting to get there earlier in our conversation, but there's an interesting thing that happens when you adopt kids, particularly kids that are already walking and talking when they come into your life. You go through this really chaotic adjustment period because nobody knows each other and it's very. It's just. it's just so awkward for everybody involved and and there's.

Speaker 2:          01:45:30       There's a, there's so much to it, but it's a reallY difficult time for everybody, but then when you have that, when you get on the other side of it and he really falling in love with your kids and you could feel that they're falling in love with you and you're becoming this family. We have these videos. We went on this trip back to Wisconsin where I'm from and when we were just. Things were really starting to come together before this trip and then when we went on the trip, the kids like you're describing the kid pushing the suitcase, like they have to stay a little tighter with you because you're in airports and you're and you're driving and you're going to like a cabin and doing these things and by the time we got back we were a family. Like we knew my wife and I were like, wow, we're, we're, we're like a real family now.

Speaker 2:          01:46:08       Like we love these kids so much and we can tell they love us and it's an amazing thing. So we have videos from that trip and those videos like you're saying, or just like gold, you know, it's so amazing to see this phone number, the bonding. That's got to be such an intense feeling to, to realize that these kids could have gone in some terrible direction. I mean they could. When you're six years old, you're, you're, you're. So, anything can happen. Anything can go wrong. And instead they got so lucky and they found you. I mean, it's like what an incredibly positive thing that is, that you've done an incredibly

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       positive thing for their lives that they came in contact with you. And so fortunate, I mean, it's amazing, but for our lives too, and we didn't know it for a while, you know, we had that period where we were like, you really feel like for awhile they're like, okay, we've, we've done a good thing here and we're going to suffer for it for the rest of our lives. And then. But then as it comes online, I had this one more, I think I told you this, but I had this one moment that, and I'm not this kind of guy, I don't think of myself as this kind of guy, but after all of this, just frustration and craziness and, and uh, the kids would wake up really early every morning and they would be out in the hallway throwing things at each other and arguing and whatever.

Speaker 1:          01:47:28       And you, you're so sleep deprived and you're just. So like the overheads. And one morning I woke up, I think it was a sunday and it was quiet in the room, my wife was still asleep and it was like around the time where the kids are normally up and I woke up and I thought, oh wow, it's quiet in here. And then I had this just overwhelming feeling that I couldn't even identify it first. and then I thought, oh shit, I missed them right now. Like I'm actually waiting for them to come in the room and wake us up. And that was, that was really a big moment for me where I was like, wow, I've turned a big corner here and that what you get from them and that, those kinds of feelings is pretty incredible. Is this strange scene in the movie, like thinking that this is based on not just your life experience but also based on your interaction with some kids that you never wanted up adopting?

Speaker 1:          01:48:14       Yeah, it's. Well and also I met a, but like I said, I've met a bunch of families along the waY and some of the. There's this young girl named Maria Green who became a consultant on the movie because she grew up in foster care. She was adopted as a teenager. She's amazIng kid. She goes to ucla right now and uh, and so I know either my own stories or other people's stories. I can associate them with really specific kids. So the thing that's embarrassing is that I'm taking the movie all over the country and I've seen the movie like a thousand times now. And anytime I watch it with an audience, I get emotional watching the movie. I mean the movie is really funny, but it's got some really emotional moments and it's embarrassing because it looks like, oh good. So broken up by my, my own movie, but it's. But it's really because I'm thinking about my own kids or I'm thinking about these, these real kids that are, you know, that I've met along the way.

Speaker 3:          01:49:04       So it's, it's pretty good. I got to tell you this, that I know I'm in it and I'm amazing in it, but I'm saying I'm saying, uh, in the. We went to the screening like a month or two ago and christina and I, uh, get there and we run into mark right away. So he's like, he's like, you haven't seen this? And I go, no. He's like, it's really men. It's really good. And I was like, yeah, I keep hearing it's good. And he's like, no. Like he was like, he was prepping me for how emotional he gets in it. He goes, he's like, ah, you know, I, I've, I've been some violent stuff that's awesome, but this, I'm in and he's like, I couldn't help but like get emotional about it. And I was like, okay. I'm like, all right. and then I sit there and watch and then I look over seeing this crying and parts of the movie. I start getting emotional person. But I mean it's like he actually says you, you did a really good job of balancing those emotional moments with the comedy. So, I mean, I don't know how you do it, but like the, the back and forth of it was like a perfect balance. And I think it's, um, it's a great movie. I mean, everybody who's seen it has, you know that has said anything to me is just like blown away by the movie.

Speaker 1:          01:50:16       Yeah, that. Well, and that balance of comedy and drama was what we worked on. that was the number one thing we worked on through every draft of everything and it's great and it is really fun to watch with an audience because they do get emotionally caught up in it, but we're always coming back and giving them a laugh where they need it. You know, and this is a hit. Do you think they're going to want to dig down to other aspects of your personal life to pull out this is all I got. This is bluestar airlines for me, this is what does bluestar airlines in wall street when charlie sheen couldn't sell anything to gordon gekko and then he's like, well what about bluestar lines? Because he had the tip from his dad because his dad was a mechanic at blue star alliance. That's been kind of the running joke that this is the only interesting thing in my life.

Speaker 1:          01:50:55       I've Already gone there and It's just, you know, when this. When this happens, you know, and you, you become part of that adoption community as well, so it really becomes a big part of who you are and who your family is and that kind of thing. so you know, this is all I got. I got this. And then making movies. This must be a different movie for you though. I mean you, I'm sure you love your other movies, but this one's going to be a really different fits. It's really different because I, you know, I was talking about sex drive before and the reason why that one was a special place in my heart is because it was my first real hollywood movie and I was just, it, it's, it was just such an amazing experience to just be this bumpkin from out of nowhere making this movie with all this budget and it was great.

Speaker 1:          01:51:36       But I've had great experiences on all the movies that I've made, but this one is totally different. It's a different tone. It has more drama, it has more gravity to it. It's about something that is really, really important to me and it. And it's really funny and we have people like tom and the movIe and tom is, I mean, you know, we're joking, but he is really funny in the movie. I believe you. It was funny. He's a funny guy. Yeah, he's a fun. I really do. Thanks ben. Telling people that for years. But I haven't been lying.

Speaker 3:          01:52:05       It was fun to do men. It was really a thrill.

Speaker 1:          01:52:08       We just became one of those. No, but I'll tell you this though.

Speaker 3:          01:52:13       The comradery on that thing was another thing that was really fun because you go to a different. We went to atlanta and we have this great group every day where we have like, you know, you have the big stars. But then like people I mentioned like margo and then uh, and julie, michael, allen, brit, jodie. And we would just like, it was like, it is kind of like being in a camp or something, which for me was the first experience you

Speaker 1:          01:52:37       don't know is that. And what a lot of people who work in movies a lot of times that, that so much of the, the um, the comradery of the set is set by kind of number one, number two on the call sheet, like whoever the big movie stars are in your movie. Sometimes you know, you, you hear these stories, a lot of stories, steven seagal, but just people walking on eggshells around, you know, whoever the, you know, and when you have people like mark and rose were really cool and just really easy to deal with everybody. Everybody just is so much more relaxed and having a really good time when, you know. And then, I mean, you know, I'll take some credit for it myself too because john and I tried to run a really happy set and we just try to have definitely, man, definitely you guys are so like you guys are low maintenance types, you know, like you're like the type of people like it feels I took you for just to show you how unpretentious he is.

Speaker 1:          01:53:31       When I got the part I was like, I, we'd been speaking about the part and other things and then you know, I'll get an email about rehearsal at paramount and I would just call sean, like the director director. I'm like, hey, is rehearsal at 10? And he's like, uh, yeah. And I'm like, where do I park? And he's like, I think in the, there's a lot that they'll tell you they'll to go and I'm like, okay, and then hang up. And I'd be like, I'm just calling the director of like a major picture. Like where do I park? And he was never fucking figure it out, you know, he was just like, yeah, it's fine. Just call me if you need parking directions. It's really fun. When is this? Is it out right now? Comes out friday. Comes out just for our 16th. Yeah. Beautiful.

Speaker 1:          01:54:15       I think we can wrap this. That was great. Yeah. Thank you man. Thank you. Thanks for doing this. Thanks for making the movie. Thanks for everything. Thanks for hiring my friend. Thanks for by the way, I wanted to tell you before we, before we cut out that video that you did share that you were talking about before of the little girl. Got a little girl when that, when that went out, we were in this process of discussing, you know, the movie and and how to kind of get the message out on the movie and I got that video. I saw it on your thing and I immediately sent it to everybody associated with the movie and I was like, you guys, this is our movie. It's right here in this video. It's right here and that girls face. That's it. That's our movie. Wow. That was really helpful. I'm glad you sent that out. Oh, I could not. When I got ahold of that video was so intense. It was so amazing. I know. You were trying to. Oh no, no worries, man. No, I'm a instant family out friday. Go see it. You go see it. Bye everybody. Thanks.
