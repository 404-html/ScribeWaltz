Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Do we have enough left for tomorrow? We don't have tomorrow. I'll bring the sweet

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Ben Shapiro. We are live. The people have spoken.

Speaker 2:          00:00:10       Well, thank you for having me. Thanks for being here, man. I became a fan of yours when I watched you. Um, uh, with what the fuck is his name? The CNN asshole. Piers Morgan. That was glorious when you went after him with the sandy hook thing, like right away. Immediately, like a, it was just glorious and you could tell that he didn't know what to do with it and he literally said, how dare you, which is what I say to people all the time when I'm joking you was one of my friends had it looked like he was clutching his pearls. He was really pissed. He was really good. It was a two segment interview and during the break I said to him, thanks so much for having me on any kind of growled at me. He was not a happy camper. He. Yeah. Well you crushed him.

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       And the other, one of my other favorite ones was Chelsea handler crushing him where she was literally talking like, you don't even talk to me in the break and the break. You're checking your phone and checking twitter and, and he, you could tell he was like, oh no, he just came from that Weird British tabloid environment and you found out that the company that he worked for did really creepy shit. Like check people's voicemails. They hacked into people's people who are dead and they gave the family false hope because they had checked the voicemail and they found out that someone checked in, they thought, oh, maybe she's still alive. And then we made him a host on like the x factor. I brought him on. CNN is awesome. I just don't make any decisions on, around why CNN thought that we have this fascination with British people.

Speaker 2:          00:01:31       Yes. If you have a British accent, we automatically add 20 points here. Icu. Yeah. They're great for like selling mops, late night and nonstick cookware. And I enjoyed John Oliver. I think John Oliver's great. And apparently he has a, you know, a lot of people think of all British accents as being the same, but he has like a blue collar British accent. But I don't, I, I can't tell the difference too much except for when I'm watching my fair lady or something. Well, I could tell people from Manchester and stuff like that because they, they, you know, they have like the sort of way of talking so fast that all the words kind of pile into each other. But uh, yeah, Oliver's, his uh, his recent one. Eddie Bravo got really mad at it. The recent one about, uh, Alex Jones is fucking hilarious. I don't know if you've seen it. It's almost impossible to make something not funny about Alex Jones. You've got to meet Alex. have you met him?

Speaker 2:          00:02:22       I don't know that given how much I've made fun of him. Fine. He says strip off his shirt and he might be, they'd calm down. You're a good guy. We're basically on the same team. He would come around if you remember the piers Morgan thing happened two nights after Alex was on Piers Morgan said, Elena. So appears was like flying high because he had that whole debate with Alex and Alex did his shtick and it was really over the top and he thought I was going to be like Alex Jones prior to and who's going to be peers succeeds again and Alex and I could not be more different than our britches. No, you're very rational and very reasonable and we've been talking about some your debates.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       There's not a lot of guys like you out there, which is really interesting. It's like you're a fast thinking, fast talking. Very smart young guy who's also a conservative, like there's not a lot of those out there. And this is one of the things that we're encountering today is there, especially in college campuses, there's this very strange separation between the left and the right to the point where the right is like almost nonexistent or at least doesn't have any representation and they're actively shunning that representation. Like they're pushing people out. I know what's going on with you in Berkeley. Has that been written seven resolved?

Speaker 4:          00:03:35       Yeah, I think that uh, so, so Berkeley, after the publicity they said they're going to explain to people if they don't know the whole story. Yes. So UC Berkeley, if you recall, last year, I actually spoke there before any of this happened. I spoke to UC Berkeley and April 2016 and then Milo was supposed to speak there and he actually went there and there was a riot where antifa infiltrated the student community and there are all these pictures of them bombing things and blowing up cars and then understanding them in a fire at least in and throwing things at windows. And so Berkeley shut down that event for safety reasons. Then Ann Coulter wanted to speak there and they basically used what they called time, place and manner restrictions to stop her. They kept saying, well we have safety problems, we can't figure out how to do the event. And in the end they just canceled it because they didn't have security.

Speaker 4:          00:04:14       And then young Americans foundation which sponsors me to go to a lot of these campuses, they. So we want Shapiro to come and again I spoke to like a year and a half ago and they give them two and a half months advance and Berkeley said, well we have no venues available and so this seemed to be another cover for. We're not going to allow a conservative on campus because their security problems. So we made that public and then Berkeley said, no, no, no, no, we'll, we'll, we'll make, we'll make sure that you get in. They give us an alternative venue and do they even said they covered the security things? They didn't like the bad publicity. Oh, well that's nice. Yeah. So that should be good.

Speaker 3:          00:04:43       Well you know what happened with Jordan Peterson yesterday? Yes. Yeah, just yesterday, Jordan Peterson was banned from youtube and Youtube has a new policy that uh, it's very, it's very weirdly worded, but apparently they're allowed to block and restrict any kind of videos that are about religion or that could be deemed offensive, which is almost everything.

Speaker 4:          00:05:06       Yeah, that's right. And anything that's remotely, if I mean, anything that's interesting is, is going to be offensive to somebody.

Speaker 3:          00:05:12       So won't be monetize, it also won't be in the videos of interest or

Speaker 4:          00:05:16       I know they did this to a prager university as well. They had blocked like 10 of their videos a couple of months ago. So it's, it's. Yeah, I mean this is nasty stuff and listen, youtube as a private company, they have the right to do what they want but don't proclaim that are a free speech promoting institution. If you're going to block people like Jordan,

Speaker 3:          00:05:32       well the the problem is they're not blocking things that are offensive to other people there. They're not blocking certain things that are representing Islam in a positive light. There's, there's a lot of weirdness with this left wing choice of what to sensor and what not to censor and it's not just dangerous. It's also bad for the whole idea of being a progressive or being liberal cause it makes you look. It makes them look really petty and really weird and really resistant and hesitant to actually have real debate.

Speaker 4:          00:06:06       Yeah, for sure. And this is one of the reasons why I'm very meticulous in my terminology about people who are on the other side of the aisle, actually separate people who are liberal from people who are leftists. So when there are people who try to band speech, I call them leftist, and if they are not interested in banding speech, then their liberal, meaning they want bigger government, they disagree with me on politics, but they're still willing to have a conversation and they want an open forum. People who are on the hard left think that it's actually an insult to their identity to disagree with them. And this is what I experienced sometimes on, on campuses, you know, at cal state la where there's a near riot when I speak, or University of Wisconsin where people stormed the stage and stand in front of it and won't leave or state where we have, again, another near violence incident over at Penn state or depaul where they actually banned me outright. So sometimes you get this routine, uh, from people who think that they conflate their viewpoint with their identity. And then if you have a different viewpoint, you're denying them their humanity and it's like, no, I'm not the nine years. I just think what you're saying is dumb. Like

Speaker 3:          00:06:58       good point. That's a very good point is that they have their identity completely connected with their ideology. And when you oppose these people, when you have these debates or these people, what's really fascinating is the level of a stereo that gets reached while you're staying calm.

Speaker 4:          00:07:14       Yeah. That's what I've noticed is that there's a ton of. You know, I, I tend to keep relatively calm just as a human being and very often when I'm debating someone, you see them getting more and more and more emotional and people on the right love this because of course it's the triggering of the snowflakes are the easiest thing in the world to do is trigger some idiot college kid who doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground and what. What's. What's hard to do is actually discuss issues with somebody who is intelligent enough to make the, to make the point. But it's the level of hysteria on the campuses has really increased. I mean, I know you have to travel with two members of security to every campus just because you don't know which campus is going to go off. I never had to travel security before.

Speaker 4:          00:07:49       It's the weirdest thing in the world. How long ago did this start happening? Well, in February of Twenty 16 is when I started traveling with security, so I spoke at University of Missouri. They remember they had the big blow up a university of Missouri with black lives matter taking over campus offices and suggesting that there was some sort of big racism problem at Missou, which is just ridiculous. And so they flew me and I did a speech there and then the next time I spoke was cal state La and they brought in a couple of security guys and I was like, what do I need security for? But I'm just speaking on a campus who cares? We get to the campus and they had already tried to cancel my speech because of security and I said, I'm coming anyway. So tough. I had to be escorted in by 20 armed police officers.

Speaker 4:          00:08:25       I had to be escorted off campus by motorcycle cops flashing their lights. There were 300 students who had blocked. All of the entrances were physically assaulting people, trying to get into the theater. The police had to sneak the students in two by two into the theater. They told them that until I left the campus, they couldn't actually let the kids out of the theater because they were afraid that if they let the kids out of the theater, there'd be attacked as they got, as they were released. It was. That one was pretty well. It's after that. It was okay. Well, I guess the security is necessary.

Speaker 3:          00:08:49       Wow. What is shifting? Like what? What is, what is ramping things up?

Speaker 4:          00:08:54       I think the identity is ramping things

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       up, so I think there's a new mentality out there. It's this intersectionality politics on the left that says that there are a bunch of victim groups basically are there blacks and Hispanics and gays and Jews and Asians. They're all victim groups and we get those all those people together to attack the system because the system is keeping them down and if you. And, and there's a hierarchy among these victim groups, and if you are a straight white male, you're at the very, very bottom of the hierarchy in terms of viewpoints that should be acknowledged because you're the creators of this vast white supremacist system that keeps down everybody else. So if you're a black woman, you're near the top right? If you're LGBT, you're at the top. If you're a white guy and you challenged the viewpoint of a black woman, your viewpoint is an attack on her identity and therefore she has the right to shut you down.

Speaker 3:          00:09:37       And so the idea is that your words are violence to her identity and therefore she has the right to react. This is the term you hear on campus a lot is microaggressions as idea that my opinion microaggressive you know, even that terminology I think is really stupid because normally in regular life we would say that's insulting. And he said something, I don't like the terminology. Microaggression suggests aggression. Like I'm actually doing something aggressive to you. And the rational response to someone aggressing you is to use physical force in response. And so you start, you start to see a more violent response. I think that's. It's been growing in our politics. I think there's a reactionary side on the right that's, that's growing. And if there's an identity politics on the left that says now black identity politics, gay identity politics, female identity politics, I think you're starting to see in some areas of white identity politics that's almost formed in response.

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       Like, okay, well if everybody else gets to have their identity politics, why can't we defend ourselves on those same grounds? I hate that shit. It's terrible. I hate that shit too. And I would like to find the person who invented the term microaggression, that fucker, whoever it was, they. They created quite a mess. Now, I'm sure you saw what happened at Evergreen with Bret Weinstein. We're, we're literally left is eating itself and that's where it gets crazy. He's like, you're not progressive enough unless you're literally submitting to leaving your class because you're white. Like you can't be there because you're white. They want a day of absence, meaning the professors, the white people. And then when you don't do it, you're somehow in other racist and a Nazi. I mean, the whole thing is, the whole thing was very bizarre to watch, but, but not not surprising because you see it so much so often all over the country right now and it's almost like some new flower of ridiculous thinking and behavior has blossomed and it's in bloom everywhere.

Speaker 3:          00:11:23       And when people can point to it existing in other places, like in Missouri where that woman, what was her name? Who was that woman who got the click? Yeah, whatever her name was that when you see it in video, when you see her on video saying, can we get some muscle over here? Like this is fucking insane. Like you're, you're telling a photographer and by the way, a minority and Asian Asian man taking photos of a public place that you've created some safe space. But it's, it's, it's this weird thing where it's half of it is identity politics, but it's also wrapped up in this need to control people and control people's behavior. Control their vernacular, control the way they communicate. And how you know how much you give in to group think it's weird.

Speaker 4:          00:12:12       It's scary. And a Jonathan Heit who's a social psychologist over at Nyu, he did a really good piece for the Atlantic in 2015 about this phenomenon, this kind of safe space, trigger warning phenomenon. This idea that you must never be forced into a position where someone has an idea that opposes yours. And what he said is it basically makes people crazy. You know, it actually makes you crazy that the idea in psychology is that if you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome, if you're depressed or if you're an oppressive, then you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome. The way that psychologists deal with that is with cognitive behavioral therapy. They say, okay, we're in this chain of thoughts are going wrong. Are you attributing to somebody a motive they don't have? Or does your wife really being nasty?

Speaker 4:          00:12:47       Or is it you just attributing nasty to her and that's why you're getting depressed or spinning off, right? Try to control your own chain of thoughts. What the microaggression trigger warning culture does is it actually grants down. The more you are offended, the more value you are granted, and therefore you have actually an interest in being offended. We give you awards. If you're offended by your, your treasured. If you're offended because it demonstrates that you're woke, right, you're. The more you are offended, the more we can show that you are woke and because you are woke. Therefore your granted this virtue. You get to Lord it over everyone else. I mean, I say in my speeches, if we could somehow identify like the LGBT, half black, half Hispanic, one quarter native American little person, you know, then we would finally have the, the person who we could go to dance for all of our questions because their identity would be unquestionable. It'd be Yoda, right? If we could find yoga, we could just get rid of democracy and discussion altogether. He can just rule from on high. He, she and I don't want to put a gender on Yoda,

Speaker 3:          00:13:39       right? I don't think Yodas gender does Yoda. It's got to be a guy or deep voice. Maybe we're being rude by incidents. No, but yeah, you're absolutely right because no one is a no one's left enough.

Speaker 4:          00:13:52       Yeah, it's, it's. I don't know where the limit is and it's there so far left that they've actually made common cause with the people they hate. Right. So when they talk about safe spaces and saw it, you had misery and all these black students protesting and they actually said, we don't want white people who think like us and who want to help us in our safe spaces. We feel insulted by that. I just thought to myself, well, the KKK agrees, like if you want to do safe spaces for separate races, I can find some Jim Crow racist are totally up for that from like 1962.

Speaker 3:          00:14:20       Well, there's the really bizarre statement that I've heard over and over again that black people cannot be racist against white people because they don't have any power over white people.

Speaker 4:          00:14:28       Yes. Wow. Which is just insane. I mean, it's an an inane statement. This idea that you have to. You have to have power in the superstructure in order for you to even to be erased. I could understand the argument if they said, look, you being racist is not connected to racist action. If you don't have the capacity for action that affects people, then your personal racism is not as important as the of people in power. Then at least is an argument where the idea that you can't be racist at all if you're, if you're black because black people don't have enough pat. First of all, the idea that black people have no power in the United States is utterly crazy. I mean, it's utterly crazy. Well, especially when it was going on while Mama was president, the attorney general was the president. I always said this about Baltimore.

Speaker 4:          00:15:10       We kept hearing in Baltimore, right? Would they? The riots they'd bought, they'd riots and they were saying, well, Baltimore PD, you know, they're, they're cracking down on black people. I'll get the chief of police was black. The majority of the city council was black and Democrat. The entire, the, the deputy district attorney who was prosecuting the case was black. The majority of the police department was minority. The attorney general of the United States was black and the president of the United States was black, but apparently the majority of the city of Baltimore is black, but apparently it's the white guys felt like I just at some point, you're gonna have to make your ideas actually work in concert with reality. I can't. I can't do this with you.

Speaker 3:          00:15:43       Do you ever step back and look at this trend and look at what's going on in popular culture and looking what's going on with identity politics in this war between the left and the right and wonder where it's going. I mean, if it feels like the people on the left are completely emboldened by the fact that you have this guy in office who has said things like grabbing by the pussy and he lives all the time and makes fun of people's plastic surgery and you think that having this guy in in this position, I guess in some way emboldens them and makes them even more convinced the fact they're right. You know, fight, but put up the resistance and the hashtag resistance. Hashtag resist. It's all over the place. Where does this go?

Speaker 4:          00:16:30       I think. Well, no place. Good. I think what's happening, and it's one of the things that I personally am not a fan of, and this goes all the way back to the piers Morgan debate you mentioned. I mean I started off that debate with Piers Morgan saying to him, you don't get to attribute intent to me that I don't have. Right? You're standing on the grades, the kids at Sandy Hook in order to promote your political agenda implying I don't care enough about dead kids because I don't agree with you. That is the sweet spot where a lot of people like to live, which is if we disagree on politics, is because you're an asshole, right? It's not. It's not because we disagree on the best methods you get to the goal or we have different goals is because you're a bad person and I think that what you're seeing is with trump there an attempt to cast all of his voters as people who love all of the things that are bad that he does and says is that that they voted for him because they thought Hillary Clinton was the worst presidential candidate in the history of America, which is true.

Speaker 4:          00:17:16       Right? So they voted for him because they liked the. Grab them by the p word stuff, right? They voted for him because they liked it. He's vulgar and he lies a lot. They voted for him because they are bad people right there. This is why people misread. I think Hillary Clinton's deplorable speech it. The implication was, okay, everybody who voted for trump is a bad human being. They tried this with Rami too. I mean they tried to castigate Romney, who's whatever you can say about Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney was maybe the most honorable person ever to run for the presidency. They tried to cast him as Joe Biden's had a guy who wants to put y'all back in chains or he said that he. He straps dogs at the top of his car is an evil, nasty guy. Oh yeah. Yeah. This was a big issue in the campaign is dogs.

Speaker 4:          00:17:52       So there was, there was a, there was a story, I think it's in the Boston Globe about how like back in 1982, he went on a family vacation and when they're traveling he put the dog in a cage and put the dog on the top of his car. And this was. And this was like a big campaign issue, right? Do you remember binders full of women and you remember you remember 47 percent number. Exactly right. He's mean he hates the poor. He hates what the binders full of women thing was particularly stupid because the entire point he was making is that I was trying to recruit women to my administration, so they'd bring binders full of female resumes to me, second staff moral women, and they turned it into binders full of women. He's like Hugh hefner and Mitt Romney like, really? So this attempt to castigate the other side is really bad and I think that you see some of that on the right, but I think it's more reactionary. I think that that the unearned moral superiority that the left likes to kind of wallow in. I think that that's more on the left than on the right. Although I think that there is an attempt by some on the right now in response to it to do some of that.

Speaker 3:          00:18:42       Well, it becomes these sticking points that you use to win, you know, and it. And it becomes something that people repeat over and over again, you know, like the deplorable thing. Or is this sexist, bigot, homophobe. It's just what I was walking down New York City down the street. Uh, right after trump won when they were protesting and there was this guy right next to me fucking screaming. He wasn't even in the actual parade itself. He was like on the sidewalk, but he was screaming, Donald Trump KKK, racist, sexist, anti gay. Just boiled it down to this thing. But the best part about it was he saw a black guy coming towards him and he just started screaming black lives matter, black lives matter, and I just, I just, I saw him. I saw his soul like in that, in that one move shift to screaming black lives banner when he saw a black guy.

Speaker 4:          00:19:34       No, there's the intersectionality for you, right? You have to know how to appeal to every racial group on the basis of a stereotype. It could have been Thomas Sowell, they wouldn't have known.

Speaker 3:          00:19:41       Yeah. It's almost like the laziness in having the ability to communicate is one thing. But having the ability to express a complete thought that covers something as nuanced and as complex as American politics in 2017, that's too hard. So let's just yell out Donald Trump KKK and this, this ability to like boil down what's the difference between the left and the right to like a little statement is or you know, a bucket of deplorable basket of deplorables, whatever it is. You know, binders of women. It's so tempting because it's like, it's so powerful that it works. You could put it on the back of a bumper sticker.

Speaker 4:          00:20:19       I think we've also been shaped a little bit by a lot. We all. We all live in Hollywood. I mean you live in Hollywood. I live in Hollywood that that means that, and I think all of America lives in that milieu because everyone watches tv. Everybody watches movies, so when we do politics, we tend to see it through the prism of house of cards or or any of the other political movies you've ever seen. And that means there's a bad guy, right? Everybody. There's a bad guy. The villain and the villain has to. It can't just be the villain is somebody who's incompetent. Like usually in politics, if somebody is bad, sometimes they have a level point of view. That's pretty rare. Usually it's somebody who's misguided and it had some bad ideas. Usually they're just stupid or incompetent. Like this is what I keep saying to people who oppose trump.

Speaker 4:          00:20:55       Like why are you attributing to him malice when stupidity would do like you keep saying that everything trump is doing is out of some sort of malicious genius. Are we watching the same film? Like if you have a problem with trump, it seems to have a solution for the left. By the way, if they, if they really hate trump this much, it wasn't. I thought Obama was a crappy president. I have a deal. How about we just minimize the power of Washington DC and we don't have to give a crap whose the president of the United States. You think anybody in 18, 32 really cared who the president was. He had no impact on their lives. But now the presidency has this outsized impact. We care about Washington all the time. We treated them in. The truth is we watch it for fun. I mean, right now, the last week, particularly with Scaramucci, uh, you know, it's impossible not to watch it for fun, but it's actually kind of serious business. Like there are other world leaders who are actually looking at this. Like, this impacts my nation for us. We look at it and go, well, I wonder what's on TV on tonight's episode of trump the series.

Speaker 3:          00:21:45       Well, when you say reduce the power of the president, I think there's a lot of people that would think that would be a great idea because having one person has the authority over 300 plus million people. It is kind of ridiculous this point in time, but how would you go about doing that? Like what would be the best way to implement something like,

Speaker 4:          00:21:59       I mean it really isn't just the presidents that you'd have to reduce the power of Congress as well. I mean you'd have to. You'd have to go back to a federalist based system where localities and states have more power over over local issues and the federal government isn't that powerful because what's happened basically in the constitutional structure, the federal government was never supposed to be anywhere near this big right there. There are very certain delegated powers in the constitution of the United States that Congress has and they are very small things like building post offices and interstate roads and regulating interstate commerce, but the idea that they could regulate, you know, your toilet flushing is just silly. I mean the founders would have thought that was ridiculous. Yet you have a federal government that that's, that's that big, so congress regulates on that, but if you're in Congress, the last thing you want is to be answerable for that.

Speaker 4:          00:22:42       So what you do instead is you drop vague statutes, right? You say things like, we hope that we're passing a law that says that we should fix the environment, and then you kick it over to you executive branch and the executive branch, you know, run by president trump or president Obama has a bunch of executive branch agencies like the EPA and the EPA puts together all of these regulations that you've never seen, never heard of. You never elected these people. They put together all the regulations and then those are the ones that actually govern your lives. So if you're in Congress and things go bad, you say, well, that's not what I meant to do. I told them to do good stuff and the bureaucrats were not elected. Don't have to care. So basically we have everyone kicking the can to the other person for purposes of responsibility. The only way this is going to happen is if the American people just decide they're sick of the federal government running all this stuff and they start actively working to elect people who want to minimize their own power, which is difficult. I mean, most people in power don't want to minimize their own power.

Speaker 3:          00:23:32       Yeah. That seems almost impossible. It seems like the one who's worked so hard to get to the top of the game is going.

Speaker 4:          00:23:39       Yeah. The other way to do it is to elect people on the state level who are pretty zealous about their own authority. Right. You've seen from like Greg Abbott in Texas

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       that every so often he'll say to the federal government, listen, you're telling me to do something. Go screw yourselves. Like, what are you gonna do about it? Well, Texas is a weird one though. They're almost ready to leave, like at any point in time, it's related to put a fence up and go, fuck you. I mean, weren't there for the longest time? They were, uh, they were not really a state right now. They're still called the Republic of Texas. Right. You said that so yeah, I mean the people in Texas, I mean it didn't. Wonderful state. I love that. When you drive through Texas, every single store is called lone star, lone star brewery or Texas. This everything is named after the state. Like nothing is really named after the country. It's all named after the state. Like a lot of state pride in Texas. There's a lot of state pride maybe more than any place else I've ever been. Yeah, well not a lot of state pride in California because everybody's a transplant and it also like some, you know, people who got here and it represents something that they always wanted some sort of a liberal paradise where you could get famous for doing nothing.

Speaker 2:          00:24:45       There's some city pride, like there's Hollywood pride, San Jose Pride, but like California pride. I mean the people who run the state are idiots. Will California so confused? I mean we have a grizzly bear on our flag, but we don't have Chrisley bears. We have, we have a team called the Los Angeles Lakers, a lake in the state. Our lakes are all manmade. We have to keep pumping water in because they fucking dry up a river is just a giant concrete ravine over is hilarious. When I've shown people the La River, my fest, La River, they're like, shut up. Yeah. The Romantic river. No, no, no. The La River. It is la. It's a fucking concrete shitty slide for water and that the city is so dirty. I mean it's like I've grown up my entire life here. I mean I was born in Burbank, grew up in north Hollywood like this is that I've lived here my entire life.

Speaker 2:          00:25:36       The first time I realized I liked it is when I moved to Boston for law school because at least the weather here is good, but yeah, I mean it's gotten so shabby lately. It's such a shabby city. The weather's amazing, but. Have you ever been to Mexico City? No. I've been a couple times for UFC events. I'm not going back because I would get headaches from the pollution in Mexico City to me is like Ellie in the future, but with zero respect for the traffic lights. When I mean zero, I've never seen anything like it. It's crazy. They're very nice people like everybody's worried about getting kidnapped over there. I find Mexican people to be some of the nicest people and real friendly and easy to get along with, but they don't give a fuck about traffic lights. When we were stuck in traffic was bumper to bumper and it's a green light going this way. Cars just go in front of you and they just sort of make their way through and people hit the brakes and they make their way through the intersection. It's a straight up red light and they just go and it's not just one. One guy goes and another guy goes behind them and then he got like 20 cars and and it's just gridlock. It's actually indicative of why the United States works, that people actually follow traffic lights, like it's true in Italy. Also true in Israel,

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       like when I visited Israel with my wife when we got married, like no one pays attention to the traffic rules. Everyone's honking their horns at each other. I'm American. So like, why are these people so rude all the time? Mom honked the horn. She, but it is why in America, because we have a baseline, this is what I think is breaking down actually, so not to get too deep on a point about Mexican city traffic, but I think that, you know, the country was based on this idea. There's a social fabric. We all have respect for each other enough that we're going to follow the basic rules of the game and that's true as far as traffic lights, it's true as far as financial dealings with one another and when you lose that, when you lose the basic respect for the guy who lives next to you, you know, you need to get through the red light in a screw him.

Speaker 4:          00:27:22       It doesn't matter if it's red, then it's kind of indicative of a culture in collapse. Generally when small rules start to go broken, like in Italy, in Italy, is that 50 percent of their economies black market because they have high tax rates and no one pays them. You're starting to set in California to California is the highest taxes in the country by far. We also have the number one rate of deductions, so we pass all these high Texas so we can congratulate ourselves for social justice and then we avoid all the taxes as much as we possibly can for the accountants. Yeah, exactly. Hey, those people are making on a fricking fortune.

Speaker 5:          00:27:54       Well, I just also feel like when you get a giant number of people smashed into a small area and La, it's not even a small area includes Greater Orange County and it goes into the Conejo valley and it's just like there's so many of us, there's so many. It's almost like you get that sort of diffusion of responsibility thing where there's just too many people to care about and you lose this feeling of value that you have for fellow people. I lived in boulder for a little while and when I lived there, the People's Republic of Boulder. You want to talk about lefties? Oh yeah. Holy Shit. If you have a. If you had a right wing anything on your lawn, like a sign for someone running for, they would take it down. They literally take things down, but when I was there I was amazed at how many people are polite when they drive in. They wave and like there's only 100,000 people.

Speaker 4:          00:28:42       Exactly. So that, that. That's how I was gonna send me. I'm looking it up while we're sitting here. It's like 110,000 people in. The other population of La County is 10 million people. It's

Speaker 5:          00:28:50       plus Mexicans. You gotTa Count Mexicans and then you got account. Everybody's connected to all the other counties around it. It's not like there's some

Speaker 4:          00:28:57       border and we just drive around. That's exactly right. So it is in the first time I visited Oklahoma, I had this and I was in Oklahoma for doing radio show.

Speaker 5:          00:29:07       When you look at the 23 point seven, $7 million.

Speaker 4:          00:29:09       Yeah. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, I mean Oklahoma and I'm walking down the street and the first thing that and and just some lady and I catch eyes now in La, you're from La, you look away, right? You only got stabbed in others. If you catch eyes with somebody you meet, it's rude. You don't catch eyes with people at La and among that street we catch eyes. Lady Goes, how are you? I called my father. I was like, what? Where am I, what's going on here? Like this is not regular, but I do think that there is something to the idea that if you have too many people in too small a space, we're all up in each other's business so much that it's very hard to say to people, okay, liberty, stay away from one another, leave each other alone. It's like, yeah, but he lives next door and he's a jackass. Hate that guy because he's like, right next to you run Oklahoma. The guy next to you is three miles down the road.

Speaker 3:          00:29:51       There's that. And there's also, um, it's been replicated in rat population density studies that you get more mental illness, you get more weird aggressive behavior when they stack rats in these cubicles and then jam them closer and closer together. And that's exactly what's happening with people to what Manhattan is famous for it. I mean, I, I enjoy visiting Manhattan and every time I'm there I'm always like, no, I can't. I can't live here. Oh yeah. Too many

Speaker 4:          00:30:18       when I was there last week and I liked the sky. So you can't actually see the sky in Manhattan, right? I mean you just see the brick buildings and you know, 25 stories high. And I noticed that uh, we were walking past the store and there was a shirt on sale and the shirts entire tax was after you. You effing F and I thought only in New York could you sell this, right? I mean, you try to take this anywhere else and people would have been like, wait, what now? But New York, I'm sure that the best seller. That's why. Honestly I think it's one of the reasons why trump won is because he's basically just a guy from New York. He's like a taxi driver from New York is really, really wealthy and you know, he does what a taxi driver from New York we do if you're really, really wealthy.

Speaker 4:          00:30:54       He marries models and builds gold toilets and all this kind of stuff. And people in the rest of the country actually take that language seriously. So when he says stuff like you, we're going to bomb the shit out of him, you know, people in New York like, yes. So what we do, you know, and people in Oklahoma like, wow, he's serious. Like that's actually gonna happen and it's probably not probably that's just how people from New York we saw this last week, right? He's talking about the cops and he was saying this thing about covering their heads before he's talking like a long island or you know, he's talking about like, you know, the, you know, they throw him in the back of the paddy wagon and we do all the and, and you don't put your head on that it, you, they bumped their head, they just killed somebody.

Speaker 4:          00:31:28       And so the entire meeting went and how dare he. He's talking about how cops should rub people up. Listen, is it appropriate for the president of the United States to talk like that about treatment of suspects know is, are we supposed to take this super seriously? Like this is like trump is actually recommending a policy change with regard to it. That's what he does. He works the room, he's a, he's a New York real estate guy who works the room and more than anything else, if you understand New York and you understand La, you understand trump. He's not a giant mystery. Right? He's just any other reality TV star. He's a reality. He's a marketing image guy. I mean, that's, that's what he does. Like he's not even that great at real estate. He puts his name on the side. He brands himself, he puts his name on the side of buildings. They pay him not to be involved in the real estate business so they can put trump on the side of his hotels. Great. I mean, that's what he does. That's why I'm kind of shocked that he's Kinda crappy at the imaging. As far as being a president. You didn't. You'd imagine that you'd be better at this part of it. At least.

Speaker 3:          00:32:13       I just think he didn't understand the volume of hate that was going to come his way and I think he's such an EGOMANIAC. He has a hard time dealing with it. I guess a hard time separating and that's one of the things that I've read about him that he's getting better at getting away from the comments and not reading comments on twitter, but he fucking blocks people know about that. Too many sued him. Yeah. Well there's people at Book Group of people suing them and now they're actually starting to rule against public people

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       who are in the public light. Being able to block citizens and having their own opinion about what this person's doing or not doing. So then you have to say, well are you allowed to be vulgar towards the president? I mean, how far does that go? I mean, what are you allowed to say?

Speaker 4:          00:32:54       I mean maybe it usually be able to do whatever the hell you want about anybody, but if you can't threaten them, but it's. It does go more to the level of, of pettiness. He's the most powerful man on the planet is busy blocking people on twitter at 3:00 in the morning. Joe Scarborough and what is her name was facing.

Speaker 5:          00:33:13       He was saying that she should. This is the fucking president. He's saying she showed up with bloody scars or she was bleeding from her recent facelift.

Speaker 4:          00:33:22       Exactly, and it's first of all, it turns out that it probably wasn't true, but second it wasn't true. I mean, fuck goes out when you're bleeding it. I agree with you. I agree with you, but it's it. But this. I wrote a piece about it in national review about this. You know, you, you say that the level of hatred directed toward trump is warping trump. I think that it's also a warping some people on my side of the aisle who are, who are so interested in the fight that they're less interested in advancing the policies that I'd like to see achieved. So I think there's a whole group of people where, let's say that trump would just resign tomorrow. He'd say, you know what I've had at, screw it, I'm out and Mike Pence becomes president. And then Mike Pence proceeds to do all the things conservatives want them to do.

Speaker 4:          00:33:57       You know, we get tax reform and we limit immigration and we do all of these things. But, but he does not tweet about Mika Brzezinski bloody face. I think there's a whole group of people on the right will be pissed. That miss it. Yeah. I think that right now because it's fun. What exactly what they want is somebody who pisses off the left more than beats. The left pisses them off. If you piss off the left. I think Obama sort of trialed some of the right into insanity. I think there are a lot of people on our side. Whereas like this jerk, he just, he keeps saying things just to Piss us off. And Obama did do some of that and so pro trump is kind of a twitter troll and so he does the same thing. We're like, yeah, that's awesome. Like two days ago, trump or yesterday, there was a report that trump said that he thinks the White House's shabby.

Speaker 4:          00:34:38       Now I can say is somebody on the conservative right my entire life. If Obama said that, we would not let him forget that for 1000 years that the White House is shabby. I mean it's, it's an ass move to say the people's house is shit first of all to mansion, right? Like it. And second of all, this is the most iconic building on the face of the planet is, Oh, it's shabby. How is it chat? What was he saying? It was shabby. He said. He said they were asking him why he gets his visits, his golf courses so much. And he said, oh, because? Because, because my golf courses are nicer because the White House has shabby, but there are people in the right for like five and it's funny, like, you know, at least he's trolling the left. At least it's ticking them off and say guys ticking off the left is not a substitute for defeating the left if you actually care about the feeding the left. Like this is one of the things that drives me nuts because my, you know, my life goal has been to promulgate particular ideas, not just to piss off the left, but I think that in the fight there are a lot of people who have fallen into the trap of thinking these two things are identical. Right? You piss off the left, that means you're winning. It's like no pissing off the left. Maybe part of it, but that's not how you win. You win by saying things that are true and if they get pissed, I get

Speaker 3:          00:35:37       well. My good friend, Bill Byrd did this piece about Obama back when Obama was mocking trump and saying the one thing that I am that you'll never be the president of United States. The crowd went nuts. Remember when he did that and Obama was saying this on stage and you see trump in the audience. Boiling was big frog. Double Chin. Just sitting there eating it all and that fucking stuck in his craw.

Speaker 4:          00:36:02       There's, there's a whole story that came out from buzzfeed about his interaction with a guy named Mckay coppins, a reporter for buzzfeed in which was basically like saying to trump like, you're a joke. You're not going to run. I think trump ran just to just because he was sick of people telling him that he wasn't going to be president. I really think that's. That's half of what drives him. That doesn't mean that he can't do the things. I hope he does do good things. He's the president. I won't every president to do things I like, but you know he's going to have to get it under control a little bit because he was willing to keep the MOOC. I mean the Mooc, the MOOC was only ousted because. Oh, John Kelly and the MOOC is. Was it. What did the MOOC say? What was this was about? Yeah, that's exactly right. About him performing. It asks, why would he think that he could say that once he's in the office. I mean, first of all, I was thinking to see Ben and could even possibly do that. I mean, Ban is not that flexible. I know Steve That's not, that's not something repertoire, a giant

Speaker 3:          00:36:52       unit, but it doesn't matter. Just the idea that he would think he must be emboldened by the fact that trump has said

Speaker 4:          00:36:59       so many outrageous things. Well, I mean there were reports from the New York Post that, that he actually had. The trump liked it, that all that happened is that there was so much blow back that he had to replace Kelly Kelly in there and Kelly's like, you can't do this, and trump's like, okay, fine, but doesn't it seem more crazy to fire a guy after 10 days and it does to sit him down and say, hey man, don't say that again. You would think, right, let's move forward. That's what they should've done the next day. But the problem is he. He'd been doing it for a week at that point and he was out there like saying that Ryan priebus was leaking on the president and was an enemy of the president for a week and you're saying that he was gonna get him fired and at the same time, remember, this is the same week that trump himself is tweeting out that attorney general sessions who is his most loyal supporter for a year and a half, that that guy is like a trader.

Speaker 4:          00:37:39       Right? And that he wishes he would go away because he recused himself. First of all, trump can fire any of these people at any time. Like this is very passive aggressive for a guy who made his living saying you're fired on TV. It's amazing that all the people that trump has fired. I've been fired actually through surrogates. Yeah. But Mike Flynn resigned. Uh, James Comey was fired basically through Rod Rosenstein and sessions and then Rosenstein had to recuse himself, which is how you get the special counsel and Comi found out on television, TV, right. Emissary to go to La and, and give them a letter. And like everyone, he fires has to be fired in the most. Roundabout. I, I think that trump actually this, I think the dirty little secret is, I'm not sure trump actually looks firing people and the, I think, I think he, I think he kinda like toward, at any handling torturing people, but I'm not sure that he actually likes firing them.

Speaker 3:          00:38:22       Maybe he doesn't like people being mad at him face to face. I think he wants them to love him in front of his face. So like when he's not there, you know, you can make a phone call, firearm jetson and hang up the phone and you don't have to actually see the guy who wants

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       that guy to like him. Yeah, I don't recall me thing was really bizarre because it was like, oh, you can do that. Like there's this guy is looking into improprieties and you can just say, no, you can't do that anymore. You're fired. You can't look into the things I've done wrong. It was eight. Well, the way he did it was the stupid part. So I was calling for me to be fired since last year. I thought the way he handled the whole hillary thing from beginning to end was terrible. I thought that trump should have replaced him before he became basically day one. Here's my new cabinet. Call me. You did a great job. You know, usher him out the door, bringing somebody new. He kept him around and then the first thing he said to Komi you remember was when you met him, he said, you're more famous than I am.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       Well, when trump says that to you, that's the writing on the wall right there. First of all, it's not true, but second of all, I think maybe there was also a part of the problem was a comb is a giant. Yes. The trump. What is he? Six, eight, six, eight, six, 96. Get giant dude. Towered over. Crossing is such a comedy and call saying he was trying to hide in the curtains to avoid trump saying he just see Herman Munster over there hiding in the we're now. What did you enjoying the show? I mean it's wild. If I didn't think that nuclear war was a possibility, but if I see a fucking Korean missile headed our way, I'm going to be pissed. When colby was handling the email thing, what specifically did you not like about it? What I thought it was was crazy was when he restarted or reopen the case because of Houma, having used her cruiser with Anthony Wiener's, all that stuff was like, that's not enough.

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       Like that seems crazy. The deleting the emails to me seemed like I had Mike Baker on from the CIA and he said essentially anyone else would be in jail for what she did for sure. For sure. Sure. Right. Well, call me if this. So he screwed it up and then he really screwed it up. So when he originally said publicly, we're not going to prosecute Hillary Clinton. He was doing something he didn't have the authority to do. The FBI does not decide whether to prosecute people. They refer the information to the DOJ and then the DOJ decides whether to prosecute people. It was Attorney General, Loretta Lynch's decision whether to prosecute or not. The statute itself. Man, I'm a lawyer. The statute itself did not say, do you have intent to commit espionage? Do you have intent to to make classified secrets public or expose them to the possibility of being made.

Speaker 2:          00:40:55       Public intent is not an element of the crime. Right. If you do it, it's a crime. So my wife as a doctor, and that means that she is under hipaa requirements. There is no element under hippa that says that if she reveals somebody, you know, proprietary medical information by accident, well there's no intent, so she's okay. That's not part of the statute. If she brings some of these medical records out to her car and somebody steals the medical records, you know, if she's working at the va or something, that's a crime. It doesn't matter if she intended to do it and just left it in her purse. So Komi read the element of intense into the crime to get hillary off. And then he said, okay, we're not going to prosecute this. We're going to leave it alone. He shouldn't have intervened in the first place. Remember he made an entire case basically for why she should be prosecuted and then at the end he goes, but we're,

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       you know. But no, we're not gonna do that. He also said we're going to keep Congress updated on any future development. Well you get to October and there's a future development. They found this laptop with all sorts of information on it with new emails from Hillary Clinton that they haven't seen before, and now he has an obligation to inform Congress because he told them that he would and so he screwed the pooch again because he's afraid that if he doesn't reveal that information, Hillary goes on to win and then it comes out. There's something criminal. Then people are going to blame him for Hillary winning and putting a criminal and the White House since they say, oh, well, I'll be fully transparent. I have to honor my institution. I'm going to put this out there. Of course, then hillary loses and now he screwed up twice and then he gets into the White House and now he's supposed to be investigating the trump Russia stuff at the same time, so now he's investigating basically both candidates in the 2016 election.

Speaker 4:          00:42:20       He handled this the wrong way every step of the way because he was so focused on what will uphold the integrity of the FBI and the integrity of the investigation and the integrity of the DOJ. He was less worried about, okay, what do I actually have to do under the law? What's my obligation under the law is obligation under the law is to shut us pie hole and the information over to Lynch. If Lynch wanted to kill the investigation, let her do it. So in a sense trump was right and saying that he's a grandstander yeah, for sure. I mean, I think that part was right, but that the problem remember was not the firing of Comey. It was the two days after he fired comey, he went to Lester Holt on NBC and he said the reason I fired Columbia was not all the excuses I gave about the, the hillary stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:42:58       It's because of the Russia stuff. I was angry about how he was handling Russia. I mean, that's really stupid. That's intensely stupid. It's intensely stupid, but it's also strange that it didn't go anywhere. Right? Like that was it like that? That's against the law. Well, it's. So it's, you know, obstruction. So obstruction. Looking at the statutes obstruction is a little bit more than that. So you have to actually obstruct an ongoing investigation into criminal activity. There's a counter intelligence investigation going on, but not necessarily a criminal one. So not to get too specific about it, but you should get specific about it. I mean the obstruction laws, I mean I've looked into kind of the statutes that they've used to suggest obstruction and it's not clear that there is any statute that specifically governance, something like this. Plus it is true that trump does have the power as the chief executive to fire as the commander in chief to fire the FBI director for any reason he chooses.

Speaker 4:          00:43:47       Now, all that said, he can be impeached for any reason. Criminal or noncriminal, right? Impeachment is not a, you don't actually have to have committed a crime to be impeached. Right? Most people don't even understand what a peach means. They think that somehow or another impeach means that you kicked out of office, right? That's not rent. It is there. There's the house and they have to vote to impeach you. Uh, and then there's the senate and they have to vote by two thirds. Majority or a 68. Yeah, I think it's two thirds majority to actually convict. You have a set of crimes that they come up with, but these are all political definitions, right? When it says high crimes and misdemeanors, it doesn't mean they actually have to prosecute. You likely wouldn't have criminal court and you'd have to go to jail or any of that kind of stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:44:21       Like they could impeach anybody at anytime. Clinton didn't even have to commit perjury. If they didn't want. If they wanted to impeach him, they could. They could have impeached doubly. Every president you can impeach. It's just a vote. It's just about. So all the talk about what's criminal and what's not criminal. The problem for trump, there are two ways of reading trump's behavior in the whole Russia thing right? Way. One is he's got something to hide and that's the most obvious way he's got something to hide. That's why he gets rid of Flynn. We don't know why he got rid of Flynn. He gets rid of Comey. We don't really know why he got rid of Columbia and then brags to the Russians that it's a pressure off him on the Russia stuff. So it's a way one is, he's hiding something and now he's firing everybody who gets in the way and there's, you know, the chain of evidence does not fit that.

Speaker 4:          00:44:57       I mean, you know, he, he's the people he's angry at in order our attorney general sessions, the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, the former head of the FBI, James Comey, the acting head of the FBI, McCabe, uh, and uh, and the special prosecutor Robert Mueller. So those are all people involved with Russia. Those are the only people he's really angry at. So there's something to be said for the idea that maybe trying to hide something. On the other hand, we haven't actually seen any hard evidence of collusion itself. So we saw an attempt to collude by Donald Trump jr, but we haven't actually seen any evidence that the Russians were providing special information to the trump administration, which was then being weaponized for use in the campaign. We haven't seen any of that stuff. So here's the other plausible theory, and this goes to trump's personality. He's so petty and he wants to be loved so much that he is angry that people keep saying he run because he won because of the Russians.

Speaker 4:          00:45:44       And so now every time people say that, he just gets pissed and he fires people. So Comi, I mean this is totally plausible, right? Komi comes to him and he said privately that you are not under investigation. And trump says to him, well, why don't you just say that? And he says, well, I can't say that because if I say that I'm going to have to update congress. If you do fall under investigation and trump doesn't like that, he wants the public to know he's free and clear. So he fires call me and then he goes up public and he says, I didn't like how he was handling the Russia thing. I'm innocent. Why will these people leave me alone? Right? So yeah. So there's two ways to read this. Either he's totally innocent but stupid, or he's trying to hide something. Those are the only two plausible ways of reading the situation.

Speaker 4:          00:46:22       The Donald trump junior thing was really bizarre because he released all the emails, like I just, yeah, it's like, look, I've got nothing to hide. Like you aren't supposed to do any of these things you're saying in these emails. Yes. That was not a good moment for, for trump, jr. Do you think you'd go and then you hear that he was coached by his dad again, you know, this is. None of this is gooD stuff. I think that Donald Trump jr releasing the. First of all, it is imperative to note eight minutes later the New York times released basically the email chain. Right? So he was meeting, he was beating it out of the gate and so he puts that out there, which was a smart move. I mean, it would be smart if it would be smart if he had found a way to spin it, right?

Speaker 4:          00:46:59       Like if you'd done it, if this is the thing in politics, now the way politics works now is your smartest move. If there's dirt about you is to be the first person out the gate with it and you put a spin on it. Right? So like barack obama, imagine if obama hadn't said anything in 2008 and then we found out a week before the election that he did coke in high school. Now a lot of people wouldn't care. A lot of people would write in 2000 George W. Bush was hit with a dui charge from like 1973 and it probably last him a point in the polls. So what obama did is he wrote an entire memoir and he just kind of dismissed it right in the middle of the memoir. He goes, you know, when I was in high school, I did a little bloke, no problem.

Speaker 4:          00:47:32       Did a little blow everybody and everyone. Oh okay. Did low blow, alright, you know, cool. So if you're going to release this kind of stuff, you have to put a spin on it. Trump juNior, didn't he just put out the emails and the emails themselves contain the damning material, right? It says right in there, you know, there's a russian government lawyer, the russian government sees this as part of its effort to aid mr trump's campaign. And donald jr is like thumbs up guys like I love it. sounds awesome. And, and so that does not look good. it's not quite as much as you know. People on the left want to say it as meaning that there's no evidence yet that any information was actually exchanged with the russians or that anything came of the meeting. Most of the people in the meeting who said something and said nothing came of it, but we don't know whether trump knew about the meeting.

Speaker 4:          00:48:12       I find it kind of hard to believe he didn't, you know, considering every major campaign figure was there but, but then then they, then they just keep lying and this, this is the part that's, that's a problem. Are they lyIng because they just think they can get away with it anD they're stupid or they lying because they're actually being meticulous about their allies. And I Tend to think the former, because this isn't a professional administration. I think these, I think trump fibs a lot. He says things that are, I mean like on stupid things. He says things like, the leader of the boy scouts called me and told me that he loved my specialist, whichever, and then leader of the boy scouts, like, uh, what? So, so is that a calculated lie to hide something or is it just the trump lies by nature and so he does it a lot, but I think he's just so used to it

Speaker 3:          00:48:51       putting that spin on things that publicity span. Right. And the thing that he said about this was it, this is what politics is what happens in politics. You get dirt about your enemy and people exchange inFormation. It's just what happens. It's just you're seeing it now. So a lot of people like. Yeah, well that makes sense. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:49:09       And, and this is something that again, I think that were shaped by hollywood a little bit. Politics is dirty, but some of this stuff is not usual, right? It's actually not particularly usual to meet with a government that is really not friendly to the United States to receive information about your political opponents. But if you've watched house of cards, you think, well, I mean it's like two steps down from throwing somebody under the subway. So what's the big deal? Uh, I don't because I work in politics and when I go home at night, the last thing I want to do is watch entertainment about politics. Now watch game of thrones. That's his political. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:49:37       House of cards is a great show. But if it's half right? Like I always wonder the thiNg, the thing that gets me is when people suicide themselves that are on their waY to try out, I'm like, okay, I don'T want to be that fucking guy. I don't want to be that tin foil hat guy. But how many people are going to suicide themselves? I mean, for sure someone's been murdered somewhere along the line. Someone knew something, some powerful people got to them and they murder him. Oh, it's gonna happen. It has happened. It must've had.

Speaker 4:          00:50:06       I mean, I think it happens a lot in Russia. I don't think that. I don't believe what trump said. And again, I think this is why trump has a skewed vision of what politics is and because he thinks that the outer limit of politics is Russia. He thinks any thing inside that limit is now okay. But do you think it's ever happened in the United States or just in Russia? Like political assassinations? Uh, I can't name a specific example of where it has. I think that. Are you open to the possibility? I'm open to. I mean, if someone shows me man johnson, lyndon johnson. Did you pick somebody? And I don't think lyndon johnson whacked anybody about kennedy. I don't think that kennedy whacked anybody, but hillary, uh, I don't think hillary clinton

Speaker 3:          00:50:40       the fiat up. If I had my last thousand bucks, I'd be supeR tempted to bet on black. I'd be super tempted to go. You know what? I think She went dark. She's whacked a few people. Let's see what we've got here. Like I want to see white water. I'd want to see vince foster. I want to see that enron guy who shot himself in the head twice. If I could, if I could really, I could. You know, man, I think it's happened, I just don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:51:09       I'm sure at some point, but again, if I don't know if one, when I'm hesitant to, I think that we and I think that we tend to think things are regular when they are, they never really irregular, right? So we tend to think that this stuff is happening every day and that's why you see trump on tv saying, well putin, like America hasn't killed people. And it's like, well no, not quite like putin. I mean like putting legitimately murders. His, his journalistic enemies. I haven't seen you trying to double tap jake tapper, so I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure. no, it's not a regular thing around here. Even obama wasn't trying to like kill chris wallace.

Speaker 3:          00:51:38       Right. But maybe the, you know, maybe I don't know what boot is. Obviously the extreme example, right? Well obviously the extreme example is a North Korea, but putin is in that range of, it's like a totally feared, essentially a dictator who's a,

Speaker 4:          00:51:54       I mean there are a bunch of them, right? I mean airline in Turkey. Uh, sure. The maduro a song, a. Yeah. Assad now in Venezuela who's literally like a complete dictatorship, and this is very recently, but America is a. I mean, would you believe it if I said like leaders in France had people regularly whacked and find it a little bit hard to believe? I don't think we're significantly worse than France and the whacking people in politics business I don't think regularly, but I think every now and then the move is I'm open to the possibility that I'd have to see the evidence. The lawyer in me. Well I don't think we're a house of cards. I don't think it's gets that ridiculous, but the point I'm making is if you think that's a regular thing, if you think that it not like a rare thing and maybe once in a while, you know, once every 20 years somebody gets whacked quietly for political reasons. If you think that's like a regular thing, then fibbing is like way inside the line. Right? Right. Like you hiding documents is really. Or are you like writing your son's stupid statement about a stupid email exchange and then fitting about it publicly. Like that's really inside the line. So again, I don't think that, I think some of this, I have a rule about the trump administration. I never attribute to malevolence what I can attribute to stupidity because I think that that's more likely to be the case. It's like the outcomes razor of the trumpet.

Speaker 3:          00:53:04       I think that is a smart way to think. But I think sometimes malevolence is real. I remember the gary condit chandra levy thing. Yeah, that was weird. that was a weird one for people don't know the story. This guy was having an affair. The girl turned up dead and then nine slash 11 happened right away afterwards, so people kind of forgot about it, but they. They found her body, the park and everybody was like, jesus christ. Like this is a woman that was about to testify that she was having an affair with this guy and that one was a good one in terms of not a. Not a good one. Obviously a terrible

Speaker 4:          00:53:37       in terms of. So let me say this. I think that if there's murder and politics that will probably tend to fall more into the personal and the political. It'll probably fall less in terms of like, I have a political vendetta against this guy and I'm going to kill him. We haven't really done much of that since Alexander Hamilton and burr. Um, but it's. But there are. I mean, listen, teddy kennedy left a woman in the back of his car and a body of water, so.

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       Right. Drunk driving. Right. That was the thing with him. He just didn't want to be responsible for something horrible that he did. Right. Similar to dick cheney not meeting with the police for like something like 18 hours after he shot his friend in the face.

Speaker 4:          00:54:11       Yeah. I mean, I don't think he was trying to assassinate his friend is drunk hunting and that's it. Yeah. Yeah. I would imagine. I can't rule that one out, so. Yeah. But I mean, honestly, I'll fantastic kennedy a little more suspicious. You leave the woman in the back of the car, swim out of the car, go into a house, sleep, come back the next day and oh my god, she's dead. Well, yeah, it turns out when you leave somebody underwater for 12 hours, they tend to do that. It's weird how that works

Speaker 3:          00:54:36       well less. He was so drunk that he didn't know what he was doing, which can happen. You can get black out drunk or you wake up and you go, wait a minute. Did I crash my car

Speaker 4:          00:54:44       so I don't drink that heavily. Is that really a thing? Like he climbed out the window, the card, swim out to the river bank, go to somebodies house, come back like a day later you're like, oh shit. There was a girl in the backseat.

Speaker 3:          00:54:56       I've never had it happen, but I have had. I've had what I would call slide nights, know where I get hammered and then like a wake up in the morning with a pounding headache and is, have these flashes in my head like, who is that person? Like where was I? Where were we? Oh yeah, there was that. And then that you'll eat breakfast with your friends that go. You remember that thing? And you go, oh yeah, jesus, not necessarily blackout like I did something horrible and I completely forgot about it, but I forgot a lot of it. But some people, I have a friend and he goes, job allies, there's a switch that goes off three or four shots in and he, he's gone and he's not there anymore and you almost kinda like nerf the world around him and protect him and get him in his bed and he wakes up in the morning, he doesn't know a thing, doesn't know a thing about what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:55:44       And it's really bizarre. It's illegitimate, terrible things to him. Know I wasn't nice to him. But your instinct is to get the fuck away from him and he just let horrible things happen. But, uh, the stories are legendary, but he does, he gets sharp eyes. He gets these black, like soulless eyes where he's gone and you go, oh no, he's gone. Yeah, it's weird. But I'm wondering what that is. I feel like that's a neurological issue. I feel like if, if alcohol does that to you, there's probably some switches that aren't connected right in the head. I imagined a seven gun on, you know? Yeah. So teddy kennedy, who knows, I mean he was obviously a raging

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       and that could have been a part of the problem. I mean he literally might have gone home, not even knowing that he killed somebody. I mean I'd have to be as, and it's only defense. So you imagine. Well that was one of the things that they said that they would have used as a defense against with oj the oj with the cte, that he might not have even known what he was doing, that he might have flown into some blackout rage. That would be an amazing defense. Like I would like to hear that, like everyone who has cte now gets to like run around chopping up their ex wife and randos who end up at their house like that. That'd be a hell of a defense. Sort of like the twinkie defense, right? yeah. Well the twinkie defense was hilarious, but there are people that think that they're going to see more and more things like that at a former nfl players with massive brain trauma issues.

Speaker 2:          00:57:08       It's actually a serious legal question. You know, like there was a couple of weeks ago this kid doesn't even know he did this. Oh god. Oh wow. Former nfl player. Devonne hall accused of kIlling his mother. He doesn't remember. He's in jail right now. Doesn't recall. Oh yeah. Well that's real. It's mean. Yeah. I don't find that wildly implausible that the fact is that we have an insanity defense and what it means you don't know right from wrong. Well, if you don't know what you're doing, like this is something they teach in law school. If you're sleepwalking, he kill somebody and there's no motive sets. It's difficult to like you need mental treatment but it should. You be in jail for that. Not, not really. I mean they've had cases where people are like sleepwalking and they think that in their dreaming at the same time. So they think that their wife is actually like this defense has been used where they think they're the wife of some sort of monster in the room.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       So they clobbered to death and then they wake up and like, oh, that was my wife. It's a really creative defense or it's true. I mean, one of the toe so well, if we know that people can go crazy and we know that brain trauma is a real issue, the two of them together, I mean there's something about getting knocked around in the head where it's so completely unpredictable and then you add in this impulsive nature of their behavior that happens. There's something really weird about a brain trauma. It causes a lot of very strange, impulsive behavior in people with. They really can't understand even why they're behaving the way they're behaving. Just not good. Obviously this is way off track, but it's far from politics to brand trauma. You don't want a former nfl player being the fucking president. So that's. They did a cte study.

Speaker 2:          00:58:44       There was a hundred and 11 players and 110 of them had cte. I mean, then you tell me, I mean, you, you have more experience at this. I mean, I didn't find that shocking at all. I mean they've been calling people punch drunk since 1910 and so we'll see. The thing is, when you get to that, when you get to the slurring your words part, you're so gone, you're already gone. There's a lot of people that have cte that speak really well and they're very articulate and they're very reasonable and you wouldn't even understand that they're dealing with all these, this host of neurological issues. The by the time you avoid, obviously I'm not a neuRologist, but by the time this has been explained me, your voice

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       is slurring and you're dealing with like real heavy duty symptoms like you're fucked. Like you're so gone. Like you're, you're, you're, you're way off.

Speaker 4:          00:59:32       Here's a weird question for you. I mean, what, what would you do about like, I think the nfl is gonna start losing viewers because of us. I think they are. I think you're right and you know, I wonder about mma.

Speaker 3:          00:59:41       It's a factor. I think there's a, there's two things going on. There's the bucket factor where people like, I don't care. I want to watch people get their ass kicked. It's fun. It's exciting. People love it. It's consensual. It's primal. Yeah, and people know what they're signing up for when they do it, they know the consequences of it and it's worth the glory to be the guy who delivers it versus the guy who receives it. So I think there's that, but then there's also look the colin kaepernick thing, I think that

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       probably costs a lot of ratings for the nfl. Did that poll that came out that said, I think of the 12 percent of people who said that they were not watching nfl games last year, 28 percent of that, 12 percent said that the cabernet national anthem thing was the reason. Yeah, I mean it. Some small percentage probably emboldened them. They probably liked it and they wanted to watch it more. This is fascinating about the cultural breakdown of the country. Basically white people hated black people loved it. This is it. This is how the polls where it's like 72 percent of black people thought it was great and like an equal percentage of white people thought that it was just terrible, which is, which is a fascinating look at it. Sort of how race relations work in the country at large is it? It'S actually one of the reasons I think that espn has been losing ratings. Like I used to watch espn religiously and now I, I, all I want is to just watch my sports and not Be bothered with the politics because I say I do that during the day. It's a pet peeve of mine and every time I turn on espn I have to lecture about caitlyn jenner or about black lives matter. It's like shut up. Caitlin jenner hasn't even been athletically relevant fOr since before I was born. I was born in 1984.

Speaker 3:          01:01:04       Well the caitlyn jenner piece, when they did it for espn, and I don't know if this is true or not, but the word was that her getting athlete of the year or whatever the award was like the hero of the year award arrow a was directly tied to the exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer. That makes sense. They sold the two of them together as a package deal, which I buy a hundred percent and if you don't, if you don't, come on. Let's think about where he works, if that's the case. She came from. She's a fucking car dash 10. Okay. She's a giant kardashians. Right? That's what she is now known as. I'm saying she saying she, I would say very politically correct and I'm not. Um, but the video where they circled her house and she was like moving and the shadows behind the drapes. Did you ever see that? No, it was wonderful. It was wOnderful. She made, it was like the first time she was revealing herself as this woman. So they're circling her house. She's this gloria's house and looks like it's in malibu or somewhere where they're circling the house and it's in the hills with helicopter, like filming I guess like fucking high production values. Shit. This isn't just like, hey, you know, we've met with caitlin and home. Caitlin, tell us your troubles. You know, like kristen beck, the former navy

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       who just sits down very reasonably and says, this just feels better for me. This is who I am right now. Know that there was like curtains and shadows and it was mysterious. And then she starts talking. I was like, wow, are all. I'm like, oh god. And then there was a weird, the weirdest part where she said she got surgery, but it doesn't make me any. I was. It wasn't like I was any less of a man or less of a woman before the surgery. Well, this is the case is about gender, right? Well, why get the surgery? That was like this as well. There are a lot of questions as to the logic of all of this. I get you call it caitlyn jenner sheet. Caitlyn jenner is a biological man. Sorry. That triggered sat. Sorry to break this to some of the all the people who listened to your show.

Speaker 2:          01:03:03       Caitlyn jenner. Is it like. I had a tweet this week. All the people that listen to probably agree with you at least a good good amount to the number one retweet a tweet I have ever had. Had 100 and I tweeted I think a day ago and it has 120,000 lakes and it's. It was, there was a headline from cnn that said transgender man gives birth to a transient lesbians, transgender man, a signed the female sex at birth gives birth to a healthy baby boy, and so I tweeted, woman gives birth to a boy because it's a woman. I mean like that's not a headline. I'm sorry, like I'm just. Because the woman believes she's a man, doesn't make her a man. Like biology still exists. Sex still exists. If you want to say she's a woman who feels like a man, that's fine. If you want to say that and by that I don't even care if she gets the hormone treatments or if she wants to have surgery, like it's a free country, what the hell you want, but when you start insisting that I use that, I just throw biology out the window.

Speaker 2:          01:03:56       I don't understand why that's any better than it is a religious person saying every time you say something you have to mention god like, well, I don't have the right to do that to you. Like what the fuck? Are you fascinated by it? Are you fascinated by the transgender? The I'm fascinated by this obsession with it. Yes. That's a good way of saying it. There's not just a an obsession. It's, it's compulsory and it's rabid. So I think that there's a couple of things that are going on. One is that it's very dark, but I think that there is an element of like, this is different and we get to. We get to revel in the, in the weirdness of it, but we're going to pretend that it's all about the civil rights of it, right? We're going to feel special because we're, we're, we're.

Speaker 2:          01:04:35       Because we're on their side, right? When we're not watching caitlyn jenner because it's a curiosity and because it's weird and entertaining, we're doing it because we're on caitlyn jenner's side, but they're feeling really good about people forever. Right. I mean, renee richards was a trans person. It's happened throughout history. I mean there's, there's. What was I reading a couple of days ago about a roman, like there was something about reports of some trans soldier in the roman army born a thousand years ago. it's got to be. If it exists now and it's existed before. It was popular. Yeah, I mean there's got to be a lot of people that turn trans now just because it's exciting. Oh, there it is. Right there. A trans soldier in the ancient roman. Of course it wouldn't be. WouldN't be surprised. Not

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       shocked. I mean it's a condition. I mean the been called gender identity disorder and then they called it gender dysphoria. It's a condition. I mean like I'm not saying conditions for and but that in a lot of people's mind is labeling it somehow or a negative. Well, I mean it is highly linked to suicidality. There's a 40 percent lifetime suicide rate for people who have this particular gender disorder. That seems to me not to be like a great positive. Whether or not they transition whether or not the transition. Yeah. I don't care if you transition to what you want to do, but. But the ideA that, that we as an entire society, you have to redefine what sex is and we have to blind ourselves to a biology is this is something I'm not willing to do. I think that it's actually damaging to kids particularly more than willing to call her she and, but you can only change the name once.

Speaker 4:          01:06:02       I'm willing to call caitlyn jenner, caitlyn jenner. I'm not willing to call caitlyn jenner issue because you can't change your sex. Can change your name, you can change it into whatever you want. I don't care, but you can't. She caitlyn jenner is not a chicken. Caitlyn jenner is not a woman. Caitlin jenner is a man, a biological man, and if a man lost his penis and it and it, you know, in a, in a tragic accident, it wouldn't make them a woman. And if he were born with high doses of estrogen in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman. You are determined by your chromosomes and it's not even talking about intersex people like intersex is natural status. Intersex is a biological status, but this nonsense that if you joe rogan decide tomorrow that you are a woman, no surgeries nor homeowner and the homeowner, nothing.

Speaker 4:          01:06:41       You just, tomorrow you wake up and not, not the side, but you feel like a woman. Then you have always been a woman. We must treat you as a woman. You don't have to change anything about yourself for us to even determine whether you're a woman. We just like, no, I'm sorry. No, I mean like I had mental illness and I had a grandfather I got, I get so much shit for this, but I had. This is not me being unsympathetic to people who suffer from a condition that is really tragic and obviously harms people. You know? In terms of the. Again, the rates of suicide and depression are astoundinG. My, my grandfather was a, was a bipolar schizophrenia and it would have not been good for him or my family if people had said to him, nate, you're right, the radio is talking to you, nate.

Speaker 4:          01:07:20       You're right. The curtains are talking to you. He Went and they put them in a mental hospital. They gave them lithium and then he was Better and he could actually live a normal, relatively happy life. There's no good treatment for gender identity disorder, gender dysphoria, whatever you want to call it, but to suggest that it is a condition that doesn't require treatment there. Really, it's just that you're actually brain female. Again, this is a scientific. There's no scientific evidence to back this whatsoever. Even these studies that have been done talking about, there's a female brain and a male brain. First of all, if you say this to a feminist, you're a sexist, right? Right. If you say to a feminist, there's a female brand in the male brain and male brain works differently than the female brain. The feminists will look like, how dare you?

Speaker 4:          01:07:56       Well, it's also one of the rare times where you're allowed to celebrate classic definitions of female beauty. When a man embraces somebody becomes a woman lipstick, high heels, short skirt. This is like caitlyn jenner was. Caitlyn jenner was only a woman when caitlyn jenner was on the cover of vanity fair to boost da. Right? Right. But if he had just said, listen, I look exactly the same as I did yesterday, but I'm a woman. Yeah. If you've got a short haircut and dress like billie Jean King, right? It's the reason why the why the media loves laverne cox because laverne cox has had surgeries and looks a lot like a woman. So I don't know who the guy from. Uh, well, the transgender woman from orange is the new black. I never watched the show. I've never watched that show either, but she's on the cover of time magazine.

Speaker 4:          01:08:35       Oh. Or he's on the cover of time magazine. Well, there was the woman in that show. Isn't that the one where the girl who ruby rose. Is that the girl that's laverne cox? That's a woman or man, that's man. I used to be a man. It used to be a man and a woman now. Very tricky know still a man. But transgender tipping. So out of the loop. I'm not old man. I'm that old man was one that headline there, right? It says america's next civil rights frontier. And that's the case. Do you have a bunch of people in the United States who are suggesting that they want the next civil rights fight? Always the next civil rights fight, right? The civil rights fight. Does immigration or the civil rights fight is gay marriage or the civil rights fight is transgenders. Okay. How about this? How about there was only one real civil rights fight and it was about black people who had been historically oppressed in the United States for 200 years.

Speaker 4:          01:09:14       There had been slaves who had been slaves and the transgenders. This is correct. Okay. The worst that caitlyn jenner had experienced as being incredibly wealthy in a, in a, in a high net worth suburb. This transgender people don't, you know, aren't discriminated against in some, in some areas of american life. I'm sure that's true, but it's also like behavior is not the same as being born black or being born asian or being born with, you know, a disabled. If, if I'm a business owner and I hire you and you're a man and you come in the next day and you're dressed in a woman's clothing saying you're a woman, but you still have a full beard. Like I don't see why I as a business owner, I'm expected to eat the cost of that like that. It seems. That seems bizarre to me.

Speaker 3:          01:09:58       Eat the costs is a great way to phrase it. I didn't have a dog in this fight. I didn't. I, I was completely open and liberal about it until there was a case where a man who had been a man for 30 years became a woman for a little less than two years and then started mma fighting women. YeS, exactly. Exactly. Getting the fuck out of these women and shy and not prOclaiming that he or she used to be a man because what it in quotes, it was a medical condition that I did not need to disclose. Like that's not, I'm fucking medical conditions. Right. And if you ever watched the fights when Alan Fox, she wasn't winning because she was skillful. She was fucking manhandling handling these women. It was ugly horse. It was horrible.

Speaker 4:          01:10:42       It's like this is. But again, it's so funny how the transgender movement destroys the feminist movement by living off of the, the sort of lies that the feminist movement promulgated to the feminist movement said stupid things like women and men equally athletic, proficient with that

Speaker 3:          01:10:57       repeated very recently that there's no biological difference in the genders and it's all social. That's

Speaker 4:          01:11:02       absolute horseshit. I mean, I'm sorry. There is no scientific evidence to back that. And it's particularly true with regard to actual physical capacity. This is just nonsense that just no scientific evidence but a. Yeah. Yeah. I mean mountain of my favorite study on this, as you know, there was, remember there was that those commercials about like throwing like a girl running like a girl. Remember those feminist commercials saying what is it to be running like a girl named shown an adult woman and she'd be running on early and then they would show little girl and she's running and it's still a little girly, but she's running, you know, like normally it's only, it's only exactly fierce. It's the only society that has forced the little girl to run. Like when we. First of all, I have a three year old girl. She runs like a girl second of all and it's not because I'm teaching her that because her mom runs cause she doesn't write, but she played with dolls because you're a sexist pig.

Speaker 4:          01:11:45       It's because of that. My, my daughter started off liking trucks like in the first year and I didn't give a shit. Now she likes playing with dolls and dressing up in princess dresses. Like who cares? She's a girl, she's always been a girl. She will always be a girl, but that she likes trucks or whether she likes. It was an issue with one of my daughters too. My daughter was a little worried about argos, she's going to be a dyke. She was like, no, what's the big deal? You like lesbians, who cares? I don't care. I do not care. And she's like, and then she turned the corner and then she got. But we just let her be whatever she's in. But she was really into like batman for awhile, but my daughter is in a. And then she was into wonder woman like who cares?

Speaker 4:          01:12:16       But what's funny about this is that the left kept saying, even when I met my wife, right, who's, who's a conservative, and I made her more conservative when we got married, because that's what men tend to do to their lives, but she, but she, I remember early on we had a conversation about this and I said, women don't throw like men and she got like all offended and I said, but that's factually true. Said rigHt? But it's. But it's insulting. It's like, no, that's factually true. Like I'm sorry, like there've been studies out of a thousand, if you took a woman throwing a baseball and then a thousand men throwing a baseball, the woman will throw faster than out of those thousand men is in the book. The sports gene, the one who will throw faster than two of those men out of a thousand. And we're not talking about like goose gossage here.

Speaker 4:          01:12:58       We're talking about, we're talking about the accountant from down the block. We're talking about Paul Ryan flinging a baseball, right? I mean, that's not the way this stuff works. Well, that was the counter that found fox used was that she actually lost to a woman. She lost a woman named ashley evan smith. But what I said was, no, this proves my point is that you're not good. You're just a man. well, this was the john mcenroe got slapped all over the lot when he saId about serena williams. She's great. So one of them is great and all. But if serena williams were compete, he said she's the best female player ever. And they were like, well, why not just the best player ever? And he said, because she's a woman, like if you were a man, she'd get her ass kicked. And everyone was like, no, how dare you.

Speaker 4:          01:13:34       There is something called the universal tennis ranking should rank in the mid ranks of college male players. If you were a man and serena williams, It's like five years ago now. I never want to play with like andy roddick. He'd kill me. She actually did this. there was a 200th rank man in the world who she wanted to just warm up with and they played a like just a normal match for a one, six, one six, nothing right. And he was and he was like ranked 200th in the world and the only shock was that he dropped a, dropped a point to her. Well, there was the issue of renee richards, when renee richards started playing tennis against women and kicking their ass and he was a middling player at best as a woman or as a man rather. But as a woman, he was a fucking killer.

Speaker 4:          01:14:13       Hey, this is what you didn't solve. Feminists. It turns out the caitlyn jenner, when all these hero of the year awards and everything we met are so great that even when we decided to be women were better than women. I was a woman for six months. He's amazing and incredible addict. He's just using natural. He's a gold member. Better even at being women than women. They know wonder feminists are pissed and they should be. And, and this whole glossing over the difference between feminists who have been claiming that women are distinct from men and important and different and better in certain ways. Like I don't understand how you hold these two simultaneous thought. Hillary clinton needs to be president because we need a female president, but also Donald Trump, if he said he was a woman, tomorrow would be a woman. How Do you hold those two simultaneous thought? I always thought that in the last week of the election of trump thought he was gonna lose. He should have just declared himself a woman and then he too could have run the first female president. I would have been incredible trailer if he just showed up on the dress and the entire left

Speaker 5:          01:15:04       fires a woman. I'm the best looking woman ever. I've been. I've been voted as the best looking woman of all time. Great arguments that I got it online when wasn't even arguments and put it so many people were calling me a bigot because of this fallon fox thing. It was. It was stunning because it was so confusing to me. I'm like, I'm talking about defending a biological woman, like these biological women, at least two of them got the fuck beaten out of them by found fox before they found out that she used to be a man. I'm like, that's not an issue to these people, and so this one woman said, she's always been a woman, and I said, okay. She gave birth. She impregnated a woman and got her pregnant. I go, what about that? And she goes, even then he didn't. Then she was a woman.

Speaker 5:          01:15:47       She was a woman. She went and she was fucking a woman with her dick and getting that woman pregnant like we are in fantasy land. It's crazy town, but this doesn't mean this is what's crazy. Like yOu can't just because something's a logical. You can't just decide that someone's a bigot like you were in a weird area. We're talking about bone structure and here's the crazy thing. ToDay they are. Here's the crazy thing is that they always rely on these gender reassignment doctors to define the terms and it's really interesting because I got deep, deep, deep into the rabbit hole with this because I was really shocked at how many people were angry at me and there was one doctor who is a board certified endocrinologist who's sort of broke it down. She's like, not only is the science behind this crazy, but when you have gender reassignment surgery, one of the big issues with men transitioning to women as bone density. She's like, when you have gender reassignment surgery, you're taking estrogen, which actually preserves bone density. She's like, not only do they have less bone density, once they become a woman, they might have more. Well, because you're preserving it like it's. You're not going to automatically be just like a woman in a year or so.

Speaker 4:          01:16:56       Don't think surgeons. I know too much about doctoring from having spent 1000 years with my wife's medical education to believe that doctors have the capacity to magically change a man into a woman. No,

Speaker 5:          01:17:06       maybe it's going to happen one day with like crispr or something that when they start using genetic, literally genetic before birth.

Speaker 4:          01:17:13       Maybe if you actually read the chromoSome this before birth, but no, I mean like no once. Once your. Once your genes had been defined. What's your chromosomes like? This is fifth grade science people. it's fifth grade science.

Speaker 5:          01:17:24       What scares the shit out of me is when you hear these stories about people deciding that their child who's like eight or nine years old, that beyond belief, it's scary because you see nine year [inaudible], 17 year old doesn't know. That was the thing about the ruby rose girl. She was saying that when she was young, when she was a teenager, she wanted to be a man. She wanted to be transgender and that she had gone through that phase and now she's so happy that she didn't do anything.

Speaker 4:          01:17:47       Right. Well they did. They say that 80 percent of kids who experienced any sort of gender dysphoria as children grow out of it, so when you have a society that reinforces it and then in Canada they're now having their passing laws. Now that say that if a kid says, you know you have a girl and the girl says, I'm a boy and she's three, that the government can come into your house and take the kid because obviously if you. If you don't want to humor the kid and get the kid treatment or surgery or hormone blockers, then you're obviously doing something wrong to the kid. This is just. It's insane. First of all, if anyone tried to do that with my kid, I would meet them at the door with a gun. I mean that, that this is. This is the kind of stuff where you're talking legit civil war. Like when when you say that the government can take people's kids from them because the government knows better than you. How to parent your kids on basic things like are you a boy or a girl that's going to get violent pretty quickly? If you send someone to my door with a gun saying, I'm taking your daughter from you because your daughter says she's a boy at school and you and you're not going to take her to a psychiatrist to start her transitioning process.

Speaker 5:          01:18:43       No, buT how did we get so far down this rabbit hole of insanity and the, this is again, this is not taking away the personal choice of a 60 year old man like bruce jenner who decides he wants to be a woman free country, go have at it, have a good time, but how did we get so crazy that that becomes an option that people aren't paying attention to? The, the, the massive variables that a child encounters, psychological variables, stress variables, what's going on in the home, what's happening hormonally, what's happening psychologically, what is happening to you and how, how can you decide like this is it, you're good. You're going to allow this kid to make a, like a lockdown decision to begin gender transition surgery at like nine or 10 years old hormone blockers in there to an eight year old. Yeah. And you know, and then they'll show you like this girl who's like 13 who used to be a boy and you know, you see her act and talk and they go, how could you imagine that? This isn't a girl? Okay. I, I don't, you know, I don't know. I don't, I don't, I don't, I just don't know what happened.

Speaker 4:          01:19:49       I'm going to go with the fact that there's a y chromosome in every cell of that person's body, except ironically for some of his sperm cells to tell me that that's probably a boy. And, and yes, you can block the manifestation of some physical characteristics that does not change the chromosomes. And there are legitimately intersex people, right? I mean, there are people who legitimately have conditions like kleinfelter syndrome. They're like, these are, these are actual biological things, but if you're telling me any boy can be a girl, no, no. The answer is no. And it's, that's not biologically correct and you're not doing any sort of service to a child, especially evidence list. I mean, you know, you're doing no service to a child by bringing bye by humoring what is obviously a mental condition and a mental condition. By the way, again, linked 40 percent lifetime suicide rate is higher than any other population on planet earth by a whopping margin. I mean telling kids that we are going to force you into that. Like you express when you're five that you think you're the opposite sex and now at eight we're going to transition you into this and your suicide rate is exactly the same as somebody who didn't do that. Railroad is very similar to someone who didn't do that and, and like this is somehow supposed to benefit the person. Uh, it's just, it's beyond imagination. I think it's cruelty. What's very strange

Speaker 5:          01:20:59       for sure. And as someone who doesn't experience gender dysphoria, I like to, I mean when, when someone's got some sort of an issue, whatever it is, whether you call it an issue or a condition or whatever the fuck it is, and I don't have it. I try to be as, as standoffish. I tried to be as objective. I tried to be as kind as possible. This is a weird one though. This is a weird one because it's, it's become some sort of a fad and any criticism of it whatsoever, even discussion of it, you are labeled as a transphobic piece of shit. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:21:31       I think it's only weird honestly because it's run into the weird sexual politics that dominates in the country because if we're to talk about anorexia, which is a form of body dysphoria, yes, alright. Or if we were to talk about, I mean there actually is something body identity, integrity disorder, right? Where people want to lose an arm and we'd be saying, well the problem is in your brain, it's not in your arm, like chopping off your arm seems a little extreme, but if you want to do that, like go ahead. But if you were a kid and it's and year wouldn't say, oh well this kid's gonna suffer with this their entire life. Let's just chop off their arm. Now. Prevent them from developing like this is not an end to tell the entire society that this is a positive. Good is is a whole nother thing.

Speaker 4:          01:22:07       It's one thing to try and treat people who have a disorder humanely. It's another thing to redefine the terms of the entire civilization as well as biology in order to fit that. This is valuing the subject of over the objective. Science is objective. Your feelings about who you are is subjective. You can have those feelings, but once you are trying to translate those feelings into the objective standard, we almost told by now you're encroaching on my territory. It's not just, it's not just you doing what you want to do anymore, you're, you're telling me what I have to do, and that's a different thing. Right?

Speaker 5:          01:22:35       Right. Now, when people say that there is this 40 percent suicide rate amongst transgender people, I'm one of the arguments that I've heard is it's because they're not accepted. I've heard this too. It, yeah. Yeah. And that if they were accepted and then they felt themselves and they felt loved for their true self, then it would be just like everybody else

Speaker 4:          01:22:52       and I've seen no evidence to suggest that if, if there's. If there is a decrease based on treatment, then it's marginal at best.

Speaker 5:          01:23:01       Dysphoria, it's. Is it uniform like. I would like to know like is like gender dysphoria. Is it in a similar percentile as a anorexia or what bodybuilders get or what strippers get when they get triple f tits,

Speaker 4:          01:23:17       like the anorexic suicide rate. The dysphoria is a weird thing, you know, it's, it's it is that people. There's a girl that goes to my yoga class that's anorexic and it's so disturbing. It's so sad. It's horrifying. It's horrifying. And listen, I'm not, I'm not saying that we should mistreat people, but if again, you're talking about an entire society being forced to redefine basic biological terminology, then like it be an adult like live, like live with this. I'm happy to treat you with a. Listen what? I would hire a transgender person, but I'm not going to see. I'm not going to change what reality is in order to humor you. Like if you call yourself napoleon, I'm not gonna, call you napoleon napoleon. Like this is not something I'm up for. What'd you take

Speaker 5:          01:24:01       going into consideration though? I mean when you were looking at this, still goes, what if someone was really good at their job and someone else was equally good at their job but not transgender? Would you lean towards the not transgender person because you say, well, the transgender person, they're dealing with a host of psychological issues obviously.

Speaker 4:          01:24:16       Well, I mean, I, I think that you would have to think about, you know, typical aspects of reliability, just the same way you would with any other mental disorder if you knew somebody was, was manic depressive, which is super common and you have somebody who is equally qualified. He's not manic depRessive, you might think, well that might have an effect on, on how they do their job. Yeah. so maybe, I mean, I, you know, I've, I haven't had enough personal experience with transgender people to know whether it would impact a secretarial job or something. Probably not. Yeah, probably not. But again, to pretend that like transgenders in the military, this seems to me like in a decision that should be made my military people who actually have to determine how much does this impact the job and if you already have a group of people with a 40 percent suicide rate who have high levels of higher levels of instability, is a group not individually as a group and you're choosing which groups to pick from to be on the front lines in small units living under severe pressure for months at a time. Like is that something that, is that what you're going to go for or is that something where you, you'd have to overcome certain presumptions in order to get theRe? Yeah, I tweeted

Speaker 5:          01:25:17       something that kristen beck wrote the other day. uh, but when the military band, when trump apparently there was not a real.

Speaker 4:          01:25:24       I know it's bullshit. I mean based, just to distract from the sessions thing. Is that what it is? Yeah. Yeah. I get to 10 minutes later he was back to 20 minute sessions here. This was the part about that I didn't like. Like I actually agree that there is a question as to whether the military should be recruiting transgender people because I think that the military has certainly it. It creates a bunch of questions, not just questions about who showers with whom, but also questions like, okay, you have a transgender man. Does he have to fill the female standards of fitness or the male standards standards of fitness or like these are actual questions, does it? How does it work with troop cohesion? Right. You have a group of men and I have men. He's technically a man, but he's had you treat as a woman like does he have to carry the same amount of stuff?

Speaker 4:          01:26:00       Is the guy like how does that work? Exactly. It does this the cost of gender transition surgery and hormones and psychologists like, does that come into play at all here? Would you recruit from the anorexic community for the military? That's it. These are like real questions, but that said, that's why they commissioned a study from general mad as hell at department of defense. He was going to look into all of this and then give a report in six months and trump just sort of tweeted it out there. I agree that I think that trump's general, you know, his general attitude on it is probably correct in terMs of what the military is. They're doing what, what it's not there to do, but what I don't agree with is how he did it at all because it's disrespectful to the people in the military who are transgender.

Speaker 4:          01:26:37       I mean like I wouldn't want to find out in a tweet. I want a better rationale then to tweets and then we're back to. And then we're back to, you know, like, look, they're doing more than I am serving in the military. I didn't serve in the military. It seems like it would be pretty hypocritical of me to say, well, it's perfectly respectful to say in two tweets you're out because that's the way it is without any sort of supporting argumentation. And he didn't actually implement a policy. He didn't give the policy to the defense department so they could even implement it. The pentAgon says they're not implementing it because they don't have a policy, so as a pr thing, so this is a weirD pr thing, but it really stirred up people in the designed to do. Right. I'm sure. Well, either that or he just felt like tweeting.

Speaker 4:          01:27:15       I think that's what I. I think that's what it was. I mean he wanted to shift the conversation and it was the funniest thing about that is that he did it in two tweets in the first half of the tweet was in consultation with my generals in my military experts. We have decided that we will no longer accept ellipsis 10 minute gap transgender people in the military. So there was a, there was a, there was a story at buzzfeed that was kind of funny. They went and interviewed a bunch of people in the pentagon and a bunch of the people in the pentagon or like during that 10 minute cap, I didn't know whether we were going to nuclear war, what right. Because that first screen we will no longer could have been north korea's missile missile test program. So. Wow. Yeah, they, it, this again is evidence.

Speaker 4:          01:27:53       Uh, you know, I think it's an example of even if I think the policy is good, good policy done the wrong way is actually counterproductive for the policies that I want to see. None, like I want it laid out by madison. I want to lay it out by defense department. I want all the reasons laid out so we can have a good discussion over it. I don't really want Just like thought vomit on twitter. That's just not, I don't think it's effective. Well, it also seems that this issue is such a hot issue and it's also an issue that you're not really allowed to have an opinion on other than the standard opinion is always trapped in a man's body and this is the way it is. And by the way, this heart healthy this day. Cardia notion that it's like a man then the, the, the soul in the machine.

Speaker 4:          01:28:32       And there was a woman deep down for 40 years we had three children with a man's penis and now is now is escaping. Whereas like ghostbusters again goes faster. If you've seen the man in england, was it in england, knows Germany, the man identifies as a six year old girl. Yes. And so they turned them into a six year old girl. So there's this clip that clip with me that's going around the internet a fair bit when I'm talking to a college girl about this and she, she's saying like, men or men can be women and women can be men. And I said, well, how old are you? I love that clip. I mean, come on, why aren't your 60 actually six days. And she, she's like baffled lIke what? And then it finally hits her and it's like, well, you know. Yeah. So it's. I think this is what's kind of frightening about the age we live in is that we can't even come up with common definitions of basic things. How are we Supposed to have conversations with each other if we can't decide what a man is or what a woman is or, or whether a scientific fact ought to be relevant or not. At least we could decide what was the scientific fact or not before and now it's like the subjective has just eaten everything. If I don't think it's a scientific fact, it's no longer a scientific fact

Speaker 3:          01:29:36       and that's for amateurs of the argument. It's become About freedom, the freedom to be your authentic self versus biology.

Speaker 4:          01:29:43       Right, and again, be be be your authentic self. I don't give a shit. They will do whatever you want, like you know, more power to you, but it is no longer about your freedom to be your authentic self when you're talking about either the legislation that impacts how I run my business or how I raised my child or your suggesting that it is my duty to humor your authentic self. Like I think there are a lot of people who do stupid crap their entire life. It's not my job to humor their authentic self. I mean I'm, I'm pro drug legalization but I've never done drugs and I think the drugs are stupid. You know, don't tell me that I have to like cheer when somebody smokes a joint, like do what you want, but don't tell me that I have to redefine what I think is good and bad behavior. LIke that's silly.

Speaker 3:          01:30:19       Yeah. It doesn't make any sense. And the other thing that it became this weird political hot point where we're talking about bathrooms. Yeah. And then it become like the number one.

Speaker 4:          01:30:29       It was easy for people to sort of boil down the argument into that I think, right,

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       of course like this, what about my children? My children would you want a bathroom and a man with a dress is going to come in and he's going to claim that he's a identifying as a woman. And it got to the point where so many people were upset about it that people were boycotting South Carolina.

Speaker 4:          01:30:47       This one I thought was amazing was, was the ncaa saying they were going to remove the final four from North Carolina because they passed the bathroom bill in North Carolina and I, I asked online, okay, so when are you going to abolish the separate male and female divisions? Of the ncaa, like any you've said that we can't have separate male and female bathrooms were biological males play and biological males go to one bathroom and biological females go to another. So why do you have separate divisions? Why do you have a. Why do you have an ncaa women's division and an ncaa men's division? Yeah. Where does this go? I mean eventually it boiled down. I mean eventually it goes to one place or another. Like either we just say this is a step too far. It gives me a break, you know, science has no. Or we say anyone can be anything at anytime. A man is a woman and a woman as a man and you know, it's in just pick have you.

Speaker 3:          01:31:34       We're seeing the videos of people that are gender fluid. I have seen those videos. Those videos are fascinating. They wake up one day and there were a woman and the next day there are man. And so there was a guy on npr, on radio lab on the podcast who transitions at times of stress makes perfect sense to me in the middle of having a conversation. I just switched. I'm paul now. I'm amanda. When

Speaker 4:          01:31:58       he's more stressed, he switched into a woman because that'd be really sexist, right? I mean, I think that like if you're stressed at work and he switched into a woman and started crying, that seems kind of sexist to me. That's implying that women are the people who cry at work. So that is sex. So this raises a bunch of other weird questions like, okay, if you're like there's, there's been this. again you want to talk about weird. There's been this, this, this weird push in parts of the trans community to suggest that a male who doesn't want to have sex with a biological male who says he's a female, is a, is now a sexist against women? Is it trans folk? Right? you're a bad person if you're a man who doesn't want to have sex with a man, a biological man, and it doesn't make you gay to do that. Right? If you have sex with a biological man who says it's a woman that's straight sex, but if you were to have sex with a biological woman who says she's a man, you're gay.

Speaker 3:          01:32:42       Yeah, kind of weird. Definitely weird, but I have seen the arguments in the blog Posts and the tweets about men who discriminate against trans women who do not want to date trans women

Speaker 4:          01:32:53       and people keep saying, well, it's. It's culturally defined. It's like, no. That's called evolution. What? You have a baby together, correct? Correct. It turns out that evolution wants men to have sex with women. Like, I'm sorry to break it to everybody, but evolution really relies on human reproduction. Okay. If you put that thing in the wrong place, it ain't going to reproduce. Like that's just salary. I mean I don't. I don't know why I have to keep apologizing for science and, and then they say that my party is the party of non science. Like what? Like you're the ones who say that two minutes before my baby is born, it's not a baby and a man can be a woman, but I'm anti science. I'm just, I'm am wildly confused by this. Well, the whole thing is

Speaker 3:          01:33:30       wildly confusing. Um, but it's just such a strange subject. It's such a strange subject that's been brought to the fore. I think it's about more of the moral posturing than it is about people who actually think this is a major issue. I think you're absolutely right. And I think people love to be virtuous. They'd love to be on that side. They live to virtue signal. How dare you, how dare you with dick's or lack of fake dicks, but they don't really have a lot of fake dicks. they don't really go that far. They just sort of take testosterone and see what's up. But it's just, it's a, it's a weird facet of our society today that is unexpected. I mean you go back 20, 30 years and it was an oddity and you know, even during the renee richards thing, it was more of an oddity than anything

Speaker 4:          01:34:14       I think just sort of accepted that. This is why I say I think that it's a think that a lot of people who are virtue signaling are still treating it as an oddity. They just won't admit that. I think that they're watching it because it's a circus to them and I think that's actually cruel. I don't think that you should like put people who suffer from mental illness on the cover of magazines. I just don't. I think that that's bad strategy. What about bodybuilders? I mean, I don't know that. I'll be honest with you. I don't know that much about bodybuilding. I mean, well they don't. Do I look like I know that much about

Speaker 3:          01:34:39       the argument that I've heard of crossfit guy. I'm more of a marathon runner. What I've heard the argument about bodybuilders that they suffer from it as well is that in order to get that big, you almost have to have some sort of a body dysmorphia. You. You have to not understand how insanely huge

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       you are and they'll be really into it. Their argument is they're really into it and which makes sense to me, but I've heard people say that, that it's. It's like almost like a reverse anorexia. They never feel like they're big enough that people say that before. Yeah. Well, it's weird that the human mind is suspect or uh, subjects were really open to suggestion. Really open to suggestion, which is what scares people about children transitioning for sure, for sure. I mean, listen, you, you see it in everything including fashion. Like how many dudes wax their chest now 30 years ago. Nobody likes theiR chest or they waxing to waxing jeff chest, wax their chest whenever, whatever it is, questions about the youth are turned to young jamie. Yeah, it did. But you watch tv now and every dude on tv has a chest as bare as my young 14 month old son.

Speaker 2:          01:35:41       So I hear you. And it's like, where'd this come from? and this came from grades. We'll look chiseled. And it also came from tv and tv. It was going to be men are going to be hairless. Now this is, this is the new trend of men are going to be hairless and you don't, you don't get the burt reynolds like bare chest anymore. And so if people are susceptible to even that with regard to fashion like people have for for five years, people convince themselves that skinny jeans or thing like people are open to to virtually any sort of suggestion, bell bottoms that come in and come out member when they try to bring bell bottoms back. I did or did not a good call. They tried and people are like, nah, not this one. Platforms when they used to be our platform shoes that that's why I'm just keeping around all my dad's old clothes because eventually they're going to come back in again.

Speaker 2:          01:36:21       You never know. Yeah. The, the idea of fashion and culture also being like the saMe sort of mechanism that allows people to be variable when it comes to their gender. That's. I mean you actually see that there's a study. I thought this is fascinating. There was a study in britain or Poland, britain about sexual orientation and what I found was 95 percent of people over the age of 60 identified as exclusively heterosexual of people who are under the age of 30, only 42 percent identified as exclusively heterosexual. It was like, okay, well in two generations it's not that half the population became bisexual, right. That is not a scientific thing. That means that people are open to suggestion about their sexual behavior, which you would assume. Right. So, so assuming the culture has no impact, and this goes against the whole of born this way aspect of the homosexual rights movement and the gay rights movement that says, oh, you were born this way.

Speaker 2:          01:37:11       Like I agree that there's a genetic component to sexual behavior, but the idea that that's what, why 50 percent of the uk population has shifted toward, you know, I'm open to anything. culture has something to present at, as I say 95 percent people over the age of 60 and then 42 percent of people under the age of 30. So that's it. So that's 42 percent. Say that exclusively. No, no. Forty two percent of people say they're extremely, extremely, extremely, a heterosexual, extremely high forties, exclusively heterosexual. So 60 percent, nearly 60 percent, 78 percent say that they are on the spectrum, but not exclusively heterosexual. That's fascinating. I wonder if they only talk to women who are drunk, like young drunk girls. They get crazy, but I think also for perella thing, right? Where adam adam has a whole shtick about like in the future there's going to be a point where guys are considered gay if they won't kiss another dude.

Speaker 2:          01:38:06       Like, what are you gay, you afraid that your gay kiss another didn't show me you're not gay. It's, we've gone. We've gone around the bend a little bit. We have. There's also this thing that I think happens when you have to very clear sides, you know, were you have teams and you sort of a line in the sand not supposed to cross and there's the right side and there's the left side and we have that in this country. We really don't have a third party option. No third parties are kind of a joke. And whenever you have two opposing viewpoints, people dig in. Have you, have you seen this new documentary about, um, William F. Buckley, gore vidal. And the debate is any good. It's great. It's really interesting debates they had during the 1968 election. It's fascinating to watch some of those debates, but yeah, it's intense.

Speaker 2:          01:38:54       Yeah. Particularly the little buckley threatens to punch, fit all queer and says, I'll sock you in the face and you'll stay plastic flask. It's weird because it's a pastor. It's spectacular. And it's such a like, it's so in the, the speak of the day, you know, like 19, 68, the brahmin accent. It's, it's, it's great. Like it's almost british accent. Yeah, it's fantastic. It's really interesting. And then. But these, I mean, it's that thing, this my team versus that team and uh, I think the left is guilty of it as much as the writers guilty of it. It seems like it's, it's a real issue where there's a lot of people that have ideas and opinions. It's sort of cross party lines, but uh, they vote on one side or another and they vote for their team. And I think that's right. And I think that, especially in this last election, I think that was true.

Speaker 2:          01:39:45       I think that people felt so alienated by the other side, like to understand a lot of people who voted trump. You have to understand that there are a lot of people in the country who felt insulted by the left. They were just sick of being called a racist, sexist, homophobes. Every time someone wanting to advance a policy on the left, and so they said, okay, screw that, or at least trump's not calling me that, so I'll do that, and then there are a bunch of people on the left who now feel insulted by trump's even presence and they think all the people who voted for trump are those people until they're fighting racism, sexism, bigotry, and homophobia by voting against trump. Again, I would go back to this at the end there, there's a hardening of of it. There's not one bubble in the country. There's still, you know, the right likes to accuse the left of being in a bubble in the coast.

Speaker 2:          01:40:23       There's a bubble on the right to which is the idea that everybody on every piece of the media is lying to you. Right? Is fake news. Everything's fake news. Fake news. These bubbles are not healthy for the republic. I mean, what? We can't have conversations with each other. If we, if we do this 10, no deception is not healthy across the board and there's another thing that's going on where everybody's a nazi, like I've never heard people called a nazi more than i have over the last six months. I mean, it's been crazy. If you support trump, you're a nazi, you're a neo nazi or you're somehow

Speaker 5:          01:40:54       or another, you're a fascist. If you didn't vote for hillary, you're a nazi. Like some people have boiled it down to like the purest form.

Speaker 4:          01:41:02       Yeah, I, I agree. I mean, first of all, it demonstrates tremendous historical ignorance. Forget the holocaust. Like you just look at what, who hitler was in the policies. He promulgated, like he was basically. He was all over the place when he wanted to talk to socialist. He was a socialist. What do you wanted to talk to capitalist? He was a capitalist. He was. He was a top down government guy for sure, but he would speak the language of, of, you know, what would be considered the european far right today on a lot of, on a lot of issues. But then he would talk about redistribution of resources and universal healthcare and all this kind of stuff, and I'm moving guns, but he's just a convenient club. I mean that's just a convenient club because then and then did this part that scares me. Once you say that somebody is hitler, then it actually becomes obligatory to physically resist them. Then we can say, you can't have a conversation with hitler once you say somebody, hitler the kkk, what are you? What are you going to do? Let's have a conversation with them. At the very least you won't talk with them and at the most you might try to punch them.

Speaker 5:          01:41:54       That is really a problem with that. Those the nomenclature, right? That's really a problem with identifying someone in that way that they. They are someone that you have to resist and they are someone who cannot be reasoned with. The are someone who is absolutely evil. There's no like variables are variants in their behavior.

Speaker 4:          01:42:13       And, and listen, I like fiery political rhetoric. I find it fun, but I think once you label somebody, you know, completely evil, you have a responsibility not to debate with them. First one is really not to talk with them. Even the conversation legitimize islam. Yeah. I mean that like I'm listening. I'm sure you're gonna get a bunch of shit from people for even having me on because the idea is going to be, well, how could you have on somebody like superior legitimizing his point of view by having them on. I know a lot of people who I politically disagree with who've had that experience, what will have me on their show and it's like, how dare you have shapiro on because you're just granting him cover, you know, like, or we can just have a conversation and maybe we'll disagree. Maybe we'll agree.

Speaker 5:          01:42:49       Yeah. I really don't give a fuck about those people. I think that's a silly conversation. I feel like you should talk to everybody and if you disagree or agree. I have friends on that I owe my friend yesterday I had on eddie bravo. He believes in everything is a fucking conspiracy. I disagree with him wildly and I love him like a brother. I don't think you have to agree with people and I don't think you have to at the idea that you can't just have a conversation with someone about something and see if you can find middle ground or see if you could clearly define their point of view or find their perspective that's missing today in a weird way, and one of the weirdest things about the election was the ping pong match between the left and the right as played out on national television by the media. I would watch, especially cable news. I would watch fox news and then go to cnn and go back and forth flip channels. You know you have that previous channel button down the direct tv. I would just put it on both of them go, what, what? What's really happening? It's beautiful. The

Speaker 4:          01:43:42       worlds. My mom said this in 2012 with romney and obama. If you read the right wing media, there was no way romney was going to lose and if you read the left wing media, there was no way romney was going to win and she said, which one of these do I believe in it, so it's probably somewhere in the middle like I have a basic rule which is that if you have a New York times report and then you have a report from my site that daily wire and they share the facts, you can probably assume the facts are true, but the opinions that are embedded with the facts, those are opinions and that's what's so hard about. I think the modern mediA landscape is trying to separate the facts from the opinion and so this is why when trump says fake news, he's not wrong that cnn hates him in the New York times hates him. He's right about that, but just labeling it all fake news is inaccurate also because most of what they're reporting is true, right? It's just that it's biased against women can be both true and biased and I'm true and biased. Right? I say things that I think are factual, but I'm obviously conservative. That's my point of view, you know, tough shit. So that's. And you're

Speaker 3:          01:44:35       commentator, right? That's what you do. I mean, half of it is, you know, riling people up saying provocative things. I mean that's.

Speaker 4:          01:44:42       This is, and this is where I think the right is correct about cnn and the New York times and some of the other networks, like though, if you ask the right, what pisses you off more cnn or msnbc, most people in the right will say cnn, not msnbc because msnbc is honest enough to say we're on the left and cnn pretends we have no bias. We're above all that same thing with the New York times, know we're above all that and then they run the most egregiously bias headlines. So we'd go, well that if they're lying about that, they're lying about everything.

Speaker 3:          01:45:07       You know, one of my fast, my most fascinating characters of this whole play with Scott Adams, and particularly because Scott Adams, and when I had him on my podcast, he was saying he doesn't even vote. Yeah. just like what I am. What I am paying attention to, he goes, I'm a trained hypnotist and I'm paying attention to the powers of persuasion and I'm looking at trends and I'm making some predictions that turned out to be accurate. And he's like, he's looking at trump, but he's not talking about trump and in these glowing terms, he's talking about him as being an effective persuader and he lost millions of dollars because of that opinion. Talking about a guy that he's not even going to vote for. I mean, this is all leading up to the election where people were fucking furious at him and even more furious at him after trump won because he would do those coffee with scott. Things we does on periscope where he wakes up and he's just starts answering, asking questions and he's so measured and calm. And he had a podcast recently with sam harris where I think it was just like a little too far over the edge of apologizing for some, some, uh, trump's behavior and sort of attributing some of trump's behavior too, that you could say was in competence and attributed to the, like some, some, some sort of a master. yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:46:21       Smelly quarrel with scott I think is that he tends to believe that everything trump does is 987 degree underwater, upside down, hungry, hungry hippos. Like everything is. It's all just absolute genius and it's three steps down the road instead of like stumbling his way to victory. Okay. I knew everyone involved in the campaign, like every single person who is involved in the campaign. I knew this was a stumble their way to victory. It is amazing the minds, human beings are. We need to think it's sort of the joker says in the dark knight, we need to think there's a plan. We always need to think there's a plan. And so if trump won, it must be because there was some master plan that he unveiled over the course of the campaign three weeks before the election. He was caught on tape saying that he wanted to grab women by the p word.

Speaker 4:          01:47:03       No, there was no master plan. Right? It's just that hillary was an awful candidate and no one liked her. Okay. The, the, the idea that the trump was like, even the idea that there was a broad national movement for trump that wasn't there for other candidates. He won fewer votes in Wisconsin than mitt romney did. And he won the state. And that's because no one liked hillary. I mean, this is the untold story of the elections. This was not a referendum on Donald Trump. This is a referendum on hillary clinton, particularly in the heartland. And people hated her guts, right? barack obama won Ohio walking away. everyone talks about Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Nobody talks about Ohio. Trump won Ohio walking away. One of the reasons he won Ohio walking away is because in 2012, barack obama really drove out the black vote. The percentage of the black vote, typically in Ohio, it's like 10 percent of the general vote in 2012 was like 13 to 15 percent of the general board and that was the entire margin of victory for obama in the state of Ohio. Hillary got closer to sort of the traditional percentages and she lost in a whopping blowout in Ohio. No one likes hillary clinton and the left was so arrogant that they thought we can take the most unpopular, unlikable, unqualified, nasty, boring human being anyone has seen for 20 years and we'll run her. She's the one will run. But do you understand that the company would have to look helen competence. You have to be to lose to a celebrity game show host.

Speaker 2:          01:48:21       Like you hAve to suck at this in a royal manor. Where at one, I don't know. Now, now that thIng, the floodgates are open, but don't you think senator rock man, apparently he's like way ahead. Well the, so the. So he's going to win the primary. If he didn't win the primary, then he would have to run as an independent. Then he'd be indie rock. Right. Right kid rock is gonna win the primary. Oh, well we can only have one, two. Once he's in the office, he grows into it and it becomes adult rock. How's ted nugent not run for office yet? That's what I want to know. How does he not know jim rock given a conversation about running for president, you know, and that, you know, if the people really wanted it, he would do it. And I was like, oh jesus, I just can't wait for the rock.

Speaker 2:          01:49:05       Oprah, you know the rock my. When the rock might win. If oprah ran in 20, 20. Yeah. Is she the rock with oprah? It's a fucking dual take. Slam dunk man. The rock and oprah together. So I have this weird idea that we should actually reinstitute a monarchy and it shouldn't just be ceremonial and they can be a celebrity, right? I'll just make a celebrity monarch and that person will just be there to look pretty and queen of england, but don't really have anything. No power, no power because we keep conflating the presidency with like who actually has to do things right? But like people who would want to represent the country. Yeah. We have a popularity contest. So who gets to control the nukes? Which is insane. That's pretty wild. That's pretty wild.

Speaker 4:          01:49:42       And I think that, you know, this is, we all think in cinematic terms now and you know, hollywood is run by the dopiest jackass is like, I grew up with all these people. These are not people who you want controlling the narrative. And then we're like, you know what? Let's take. If tom hanks would only run if tommy,

Speaker 2:          01:49:59       what makes you think tom hanks would be a good president? Like did you look at trump and when god he's doing such a brilliant job, but we really need now is the guy from castaway and we need as an actor again, we did well with reagan. We need another act. We did great with swarts and anger is the governor late. At least. Reagan was governor for 20 years before he, before he was the president of the United States. I mean, let's, let's, let's put them, let's put them through the ringer. I mean, shorts and I got approved in eight years that he was not capable of doing anything except kind of sucking will you ever heard him talk about it? The way it. From his perspective, he's lIke, you don't really understand how much red tape and bullshit you have to go through. He goes, I would meet with people and they would agree with me that it's a good idea. However, they would say my voters are never going to agree with it, so I'm going to oppose it. So even though I know you're right, there's a bunch of farmers that are going to be mad at me for doing that, so I'm not going to do that. Well, this is the other thing in politics that really drives me nuts. So there are two promises that politicians make that are complete bullshit.

Speaker 4:          01:50:48       The first promise they make is I'm going to go to Washington dc and I'm going to get things done. No, you're not. Okay. The system, the system is built for gridlock. It's built for gridlock. It's why we have two separate houses of congress. It's why you have a president who can veto is why we have a supreme court that rules on cases is built for griddle. It's wHy we have states that are supposed to be able to check the federal government. All of a sudden the federalist papers, it was built for gridlock

Speaker 2:          01:51:08       and some people are happy with that because that's how trump is being like sideline that every time he tries to make something really important, I think

Speaker 4:          01:51:14       they all should be happy with that because the only way things were supposed to get pastors with wide public support, right, which she's probably a good thing. We don't want the government shifting wildly and veering on its access every four years or every two years. I liked the gridlock. My big problem is that the gridlock now protects a huge system that I don't like that's been built up over 100 years and in the case of growth of government, but I liked the gridlock, but that's one promise that's made and then people are disappointed, oh, if we get in there, we're going to repeal obamacare. It's like, no, you're not. You're not. I mean like you can promise it, but now you're not going to do it because you're full of crap wHen you said it and now you're not gonna do it, and the gridlock is there and it's hard to change things.

Speaker 4:          01:51:51       It takes a tremendous effort of will and electoral power to actually change things in a big way. So this idea will elect trump and trump, like trump would say, it's all going to be so easy. It's like, no, it's not. It's. It wasn't easy for obama. Obama passed obamacare and that was it for his presidency can do anything for the next six years. There were no major pieces of legislation. Nothing happened after that. He lost congress and that was it. Okay, so that's a promise. Number one, the other promise is your anger is justified, and this is the one I hate even more, and that is the idea that you know in, in regular life, when you have kids, I have kids. When you're a kid is angry. The first thing you have to teach your kid is maybe you're wrong to be angry sometimes, right?

Speaker 4:          01:52:25       Your anger is not justified. If you want to make good human beings, you have to determine whether they are right to be angry. Is he? Is your anger correct? Politicians are in the business of justifying people's anger. Oh, he heard this about the trump voter a lot, right? They're so angry. They're so angry. Okay, well I'm angry too about things, but are they angry about the right things? Right? Like, and trump would say, you're right to be angry because you've lost your job in podunk, Ohio because it's being stolen by the chinese or by the mexicans or something. And it's like, well, is that factually true or are you just are just pandering to the anger and on the left you hear people say this to to black folks in the inner city. It's the system that's keeping you down. It's a racist white supremacist system that's keeping you down.

Speaker 4:          01:53:03       Say, well, is that true? or I just pandering to the voter because it's hard to tell people hard truths like you're not right to be angry. Get off your ass and do something with your life. and it's true for it, regardless of race, you know, go out there. No one cares enough to stop you and your life. Your life is your own. No one in the United States cares about you, wants to stop you. Who wants to throw obstacles up in your own way? I'm not sure you can win an election on the basis of go live your own life. Even though everyone keeps claiming they want to live their own life. I think most people are full of it. I think most people don't want to live their own life. They want a politician to tell them that all of their complaints about life being unfair or justified and the politician is going to solve all that. We don't want people who stay out of our way. We want people to be mommy and and you know that's, that's attempting, attempting proposition for politics.

Speaker 3:          01:53:43       A lot of that when you talk to adults because you're dealing with people that have the momentum of all their failures in life and all the different things that are not going right. And then here they are this moment today, right now, and they want to figure out why and why they're not on track in the how to get on track. And the easiest way is to point the finger or blame someone else and everybody has their own hand. I'm not saying that people's hands or are fair and that person doesn't have it easy. A lot of people that have it easy, I have it easier than a lot of people for sure for sure. Absolutely. But the reality is there's a tremendous amount of psychological factors that go into why someone does or does not succeed and to placate them or to, you know, to, to play on those psychological factors as you know, not being their own fault. It's very tempting because it works with people. People love to hear that. They love to hear that it's not your fault.

Speaker 4:          01:54:38       Yep. And I think that's what politicians have become in the business of doing. And it's both right and left. It's just people saying that it's not your fault because you're being screwed by some foreign country. It's not your fault because the immigrants are doing it to you. It's not your fault. Well, as maybe some. Maybe some of that's true, but you have to show me why it's true. You have to show me what the actual like. Did you lose your job because of and because of China or did you lose your job because you're in an industry that is being crowded out because of technological change and because your union struck and created wages too high to be globally competitive. Like let's look at the actual logic here is to enhance and then how can we change it? How can we make it better? How can we.

Speaker 4:          01:55:13       Is it something we have to do or is it a matter of you need to broaden your skillset. Like you see a lot of people now who are stuck in the mindset of 30 years ago that you're going to work a job and stayed there for 20 years and then you're going to grow and then you're gonna leave with the gold watch and that's not the way the job market works anymore. I mean, if you're. If you're entering the job market right now as a college student, you can expect that in the next 10 years you'll probably work four jobs. You like the, the turnover is too great and you have to be constantly increasing your skill set. Also with

Speaker 3:          01:55:37       every new innovation, there's businesses that branch out become new,

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       and then there's also businesses that die and there's no bringing them back. You're not going to bring back the printing press, you know, there's a lot of stuff that I really got into printing press industry and tell them that try and get elected from the printing press guy. Well, I mean right now they're trying to stop automated cars. I mean those. I mean there was a, there was a vote, right? WaSn't there a vote like within the last day or two to try to block automated trucks. Yeah. Because there's a tremendous amount of people that are moving, but it's going to be a lot more efficient when it's not people. And you know, this is the great fallacy that's been. People have been trying to fight since the beginning of the industrial revolution as this idea of, okay, well the new technology is going to kill jobs and then no one will ever work again, so we've had the same unemployment rate in this country for the last hundred years and the technology is a little bit better.

Speaker 2:          01:56:31       Teamsters convinced congress to block driverless trucks. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. it seems crazy. It seems like you're fighting an inevitable tied. Well, I mean imagine that. Like how is that going to work for all the other industries that are affected? Let's say that you now have your artificially raising the prices of all the goods that now have to be brought in by the teamsters and now it's more expensive so it's more money out of your pocket and my pocket. That's money that I'm. Maybe I was willing to buy american, but now I'm going to buy chinese because I have to feed my family like this is. That's not how economics works. It's just not how economics was there. Any argument that they're not ready yet that these trucks aren't viable, so that that's one of the issues is that way with a lot of the.

Speaker 2:          01:57:07       So the automated trucks basically in order for them to work, you need dedicated lanes because otherwise human error is, is such that if like if there's a google car on the road and you're a bad driver, the google car is probably going to get into a crash or might be more likely to get in a crash then that if it were a human driving. Have you ever seen people freak out those tesla cars and seeing what they could do to them? I haven't. I haven't seen those tests. I actually saw somebody do it to the google car when you're, uh, when a car is on that automated thing, if you just swerve at it, they slam on the brakes and back up on you. Like people have done it to people and filmed it. When we see people using automated cars, it's a, it's, it's not done.

Speaker 2:          01:57:45       It's not ready. Yeah, it's in the mix. Again, it's sort of like a hell. There's a lot of fuel efficient, lighter cars on the road, but there are a lot more dangerous than the heavIer cars because they're heavier cars. The clunkers are still around from 1970 in their tanks. They just run through three prius's. How do you feel about universal basic income, because that's a subject that comes up a lot lately. When elon musk is talking about these driverless cars, one of the things he's saying is that one thing that we're going to need is universal basic income. He said, we're going to have to figure out some way to feed all these people that are going to get taken out of the job market because their jobs have become irrelevant. So I think that universal basic income is for when the technology gets so good that they're legitimately are no jobs. I don't think that we're there yet. So if you have a machine that can make everything basically for free, and then there's a bunch of people who you don't need anymore to do work, then you can talk about a universal basic income because there's no scarcity. Scarcity is what creates a need for labor. So if their scarcity in any, then there's

Speaker 4:          01:58:41       going to be a need for for labor, there's going to be need for new labour. People are going to still have to work on these trucks and deal with technology. And the computer industry didn't destroy jobs all over the United States on typewriters went out. So I think it's a little premature. I'm not sure there'll ever be a day when there's a machine that when the machines society is so well developed that it can take over all jobs. I do think you'Re seeing a bifurcation in the labor market. So think people who Are in jobs like yours and mine, like we're lucky this is a creative job. It's hard for machines to create. But for jobs that are single task jobs, a lot more of those are going to be technologically driven and so people are going to have to, you know, work the right side of their brain a little bit and we're going to have to train people in a different way.

Speaker 4:          01:59:18       But my perspective on universal basic income is when you have a four percent unemployment rate, it's very difficult to say you need a universal basic income. It's again, 96 percent of people in the labor market who can work are working. so that's not, that's not, that's not suggesting to me that there's this vast underclass of people who are totally incapable of working. And once you do that, you see what you've seen actually with the disability programs in the United States, right? where now everybody's on disability. Like the fastest growing government program in America is the disability program or people declare themselves disabled so they can get government pensions basically. Once you have a universal basic income, is there an incentive to work? And also I'm not sure that you've solved a lot of people's problems, like people still see need something to do with their day. Sixteen year olds. Do you see who retire and they're dead within three years.

Speaker 3:          02:00:01       The utopian ideas that somehow or another you're going to open up these people's inherent creativity and they'll find stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:00:07       Yeah, the actually enjoy the country. Julio, I mean, how many people say again?

Speaker 3:          02:00:12       You said who we like 30 2:33? Yeah. Thirty three to using the term holy. Yeah, I love it.

Speaker 4:          02:00:19       Yeah. Again, you know, I'm, I'm never, I hope I'd never retire because I just know too many people who retired and they're, oh, I'm going to retire and I'm going to golf there. Other paint I'm going to trY and six months later they're dead.

Speaker 3:          02:00:31       Yeah, well people enjoy doing things and feeling like they're valuable. You know, and I don't know if that necessarily has to be a job, but it's a very clear, definitive test of whether or not you're valuable. If somebody gives you money and you get that money, you're like, look, I'm valuable. I'm doing something. I'm contributing. I got a check for my.

Speaker 4:          02:00:49       We. Exactly. There's, there's a lot of hours in the day and it's going to be hard to fill that with watercolor painting and beat poetry classes.

Speaker 3:          02:00:55       I don't know, man. I'd find shit to do but I see. But I, I've been fairly self employed most of my life. I just have gotten in

Speaker 4:          02:01:04       driven. Like I would find stuff to do too, but there is a difference in, you know, not all human beings are the people who would actually go out and take classes and find things to do.

Speaker 3:          02:01:12       Do you have aspirations outside of commentary when it comes to politics? Maybe some point down the road. Do you think you run for president or something like that

Speaker 4:          02:01:19       and the. Apparently anyone can. And this is what I'm finding. Yeah. So, but you're a reasonable guy. I don't know. I mean I, I like what I'm doing in the sense that I get to work on what people believe, which I think is sort of the root of, of politics. I'm not sure implementing is the same thing as I said, I'm not sure that the president can get like I'm more focused getting people to

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       think in the terms that I'd like them to think, you know, about limited government and you taking control of your own life and it might be able to do more good. Promulgating that message using a growing media. I'm like, we're, we're very lucky. I mean, the podcast went from having 3000 listeners, you know, a 300 episodes ago to now we have 300,000 listeners a day, you know, so it's, it's, it continues to grow. So as that crowd continues to grow, it's actually harder for me to say I'd want to jump into politics. Not easier. I think the limited government thing to me has always been a fascinating subject because the people that don't want limited government, that is the utopian ideal in my mind that somehow or another the government's going to be effective if you give them more money, like, well this isn't an argument with a friend where he wanted people to be taxed more because he felt like that money could be distributed to people and you would get more funding for the arts was one of his arguments, but it, my, my thought was like first of all, the arts, like when they're valued, when people like them, they pay for them.

Speaker 2:          02:02:39       If that's not getting funding for the arts means you're going to have fucking lacma, la county museum of art. You have a fuckIng box on the ground. Let's someone's calling a piece of art that guy think he went to. It was either in san francisco or lack, but where he went there and he took off his glasses and he just put them on the floor and then he stood next to them going kind of standing there and kind of stroking his chin scene. There were 30 people all around and staring at the glasses on the floor. It's like, it's amazing. Yeah, it's fucking horseshit, right? That the modern art exhibits. Like there's. There was another one recently where someone like left behind a pineapple or something. Listen to the. I remember this. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. It really is crazy and it's also pretentious and it's also a stoking those fires of pretension and making something that's not legitimately creative.

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       Making it a celebrated because you don't really have the ability to create something that's legitimately creative as pointing this out today with regard to. It's funny how a lot of people who want bigger government, they embrace states that start to grow the government and then when things go to shit, they're like nowhere to be found. So Venezuela is the most obvious example, right? Venezuela has turned from what was the richest country in south America and had the best oil reserves of anywhere in the western hemisphere. Basically they've turned it into just a garbage heap. People waiting in lines have a friend named nami horwitz. Went down there, did some documentary stuff down there, and he was a, I think it's camera man got shot. He was, he was watching people like literally shooting dogs in the streets for food. And this is, I mean it's.

Speaker 2:          02:04:00       Caracas is the most violent city in the western hemisphere now. And all of this is because google chavez was a piece of garbage who centralized all power to himself, redistributed the wealth to all of his friends and cronies and then, and then supposedly uplifted the poor except that now everyone is poor. Wait a minute, wasn't even friends with sean penn. So I don't even know what you're saying. Yeah, exactly. So, so I might show today I played like sean penn and Jesse Jackson and, and uh, that freak, jeremy corbyn who's the head of the labor party in great britain and they're all just praising chavez, right? He's a great guy. He waS a hero to the poor and now Venezuela is going to shit. And where all these

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       people, like when someone's stick a camera in sean penn split face like now and just asking sean penn, so like five minutes ago you were saying this one

Speaker 3:          02:04:45       who's awesome. Well there's gotta be some sort of a left response for that. like what is, what is their take on why?

Speaker 4:          02:04:50       So the no true scotsman fallacy, right? They, oh well, you know, this is them living on and it's because they never really got rid of enough private industry. If theY just gone further, it would have been better. It's like, well the soviet union and it didn't work out that great either, but like I actually got a response. It was really funny. the today I tweeted out that according to the world bank, Venezuela has one of the least income unequal societies on earth. So it's actually pretty income equal, right? Cause nobody has anything right. And the end it's garbage. And so the, the socialist, the official socialist party tweeted me and they said this is because socialism has never truly been tried.

Speaker 3:          02:05:25       Okay dude. All right. sure. Why not? Well that was the wonderful idea of socialism is that it's going to even everything out and that you shouldn't get paid more for that no one should get paid more and then everyone should have some sort of a like a peak that you can reach, right? Like there's some sort of competition involved, but he's got to be some. TheRe's got to be some sort of incentive but only so much.

Speaker 4:          02:05:48       Right. Just like the bernie sanders's democratic socialism, like formal socialism is the state owns the whole thing. But democratic socialism is there's private industry but only to a certain point. And then we tell people no.

Speaker 3:          02:05:57       Did you find out about bernie and his wife and his wife's idea was to buy up a bunch of land and expand the college and then the fucking college went under and now they're being sued. Yeah. Come on man. It's awesome

Speaker 4:          02:06:10       based on, on a lot of mythmaking about like western europe in the Netherlands, right? So there's All this stuff. Democratic socialist countries. They're working great. First of all, a car in Denmark has a 60 percent import tax and costs literally twice what it would cost in the United States. Tax rates in Denmark are insane except for corporate taxes, which the left in the United States really, you know, they love corporate tax. They want those higher. Denmark has some of the lowest corporate taxes and regulations in the industrialized world. so everybody is coming in and investing in Denmark. It's only the citizens who are getting screwed by paying for this giant welfare state. Then their gdp tanked and now they've had to elect, right wing governments just lash back. The the level of government. I mean it turns out the capitalism is the great engine that drives like Singapore is. There's nothing on Singapore. Singapore is like a rock it. There's nothing there. Singapore has one, the most powerful economIes on earth because they basically have no business regulations, no taxes and no tariffs so that you can do whatever you want and when people can do whatever they want, they make a lot of mutually beneficial exchanges and of story. This is not that difficult, but. But it is difficult if you think that life is unfair. Right?

Speaker 3:          02:07:09       So what would you propose? Like what would you propose for the United States? Like the United States obviously would trump wants to do is reinvigorate manufacturing, make things in America again, bring back the labor force, make the take away the jobs that are going overseas and other countries in south America. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:07:28       So I think that that's a bunch of slogans from him and I don't think it means and it so, so number one, I don't think a manufacturing job is more than a tech job. A job is a job and in industries that are thriving, you actually need more jobs and industries tHat are not doing as well. If the jobs disappear, that's just the wages of a global economy. And that's. I know it sounds harsh to people who are in those industries, but it's not a referendum on you or your value. it's just saying that certain industries over time, always our outsource, like we used to make tee shirts in the United States. We don't make tee shirts here, make them in Vietnam and it costs us five bucks. Right? So, so the. So my view is I'm not going to Privilege one day. I understand a lot of this is politics.

Speaker 4:          02:08:03       You want to favor manufacturing basis because there are a lot of manufacturing hubs in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin. But then they vote since I don't care, right? Since I'm not a politician, my view is that if you want a thriving economy, you relieve as much regulation as possible. He lowered the taxes for everyone, personal and corporate. You attract as much foreign investment as possible and you allow people to build businesses with as little risk as possible and then you allow them to compete and if they succeed they succeed. And if they fail, they fail and you get rid of tariffs as well because I want cheap inputs for my products and I want you products on the shelves at the store so I don't have to pay a bajillion dollars for a pair of shoes. So I'm, I'm, my view of this is that economics is an element of freedom.

Speaker 4:          02:08:40       I am a free person. I get to do with my money. What I damn well please. And you don't get to stand in my way unless there is some sort of moral thing, right? LIke if you, if you want to say, well, let's put sanctions on. Let's put sanctions on Iran. let's put sanctions on China, right? China is funding North Korea right now. It hurts our national security. We want to put sanctions on China to try and pressure them into ending North Korea. That's a national security thing. But the idea that like today, trump rolled out this new plan on immigration and he says, I want to cut down on legal immigration, but the reason is because I want to raise wages of people in the United States. And I think, well that's not productive because what you're actually doing is you're restricting the supply of labor artificially increasing the wages, which artificially increases prices, which means it's not competitive on a global scale, which means the companies outsource, right? So it's the exact same thing as minimum wage. You create a minimum wage or artificially increasing wages that increases prices, that makes it noncompetitive. People outsource. So it actually achieves the opposite of what you're trying to achieve. All government intervention in the economy save for interventions that are designed to prevent externalities. You know, things that I do that hurt you. All of those are unjustified in my view.

Speaker 5:          02:09:43       What about our environmental?

Speaker 4:          02:09:44       So those are externalities, right? Right. So like if I were to pollute a river I, it's not my river, I don't get to pollute it. I get to throw my trash over my fence into your yard. Right. That's, that's, that's a different thing. That's it.

Speaker 5:          02:09:54       Yeah. That's one of the most distUrbing things about this administration is the cutting the funding for the environmental protection agency in the changing of their Standards are removing some of the funding for things like satellites that they using to track the climate change and things along those lines. And I that, that scares the shit out of me. Like it scares the shit out of me. They're going to ignore the environment in favor of the economy.

Speaker 4:          02:10:18       So I think that some of the environmental regulations are badly drawn and some of them are overwrought when it comes to, for example, fracking, you know, obama pushed a lot of environmental regulations on fracking or the keystone xl pipeline, that kind of thing. How do you feel about fracking? Uh, I'm, I'm very in favor of fracking.

Speaker 5:          02:10:33       But what do you think about, like when you hear stories about more earthquakes happening and the in stable.

Speaker 4:          02:10:41       So water supplies the water table, from what I've seen, the, the earthquake evidence is extraordinarily weak. Yeah. And it's, from what I've seen, you know, I'm, I'm, again, if you present me evidence that I find convincing, I'm happy to change my mind on this. Right. Um, and uh, as far as the, as far as water pollution, again, the evidence has Been pretty weak. So if that changes then I'm happy to regulate it. As far as when you say it's been weak, there's, there has been instances of fracking leading to pollution, right? Sure. But that's not every fracking leads to pollution. And so the question is coming on as the regulation or how many are you willing to accept? Right. Which is the truth for all business, right? I'm like how much we all drive cars, how much water bottles? Somewhere there's a seagull choking on a cap.

Speaker 4:          02:11:23       Correct. So like how much are you willing to accept? Like what I don't appreciate is when people kind of. What's the evidence when it's like, oh well I accept my set my water on fire because of fracking. It's like, no, that's not because of fracking. That's because of the ground water. But in any case, the, you know, the, as far as the satellites in, in global warming, um, listen, I think that it's pretty clear that the climate is warming, mean the greenhouse gas effect is a thing. The question to me is less whether it's happening and more, what are you going to do about it because even the left seems to have no real solutions as to what to do except for massively cutting economic growth. And it seems to me that if we're talking about an increase according the epcc, If something like seven degrees fahrenheit over the course of the next century, then on average, right, not, not universally on average, then it seems to me that it's easier to just say that the climate changes over time and maybe cities that are on the coast are going to have to pull back a little bit over time, like a 100 years, a long time, a 100 years ago you would've said that the pollution was the chief thing to worry about in the United States because we were all using smoke stacks and parts.

Speaker 4:          02:12:26       Intuit's. Yeah, exactly. And now, not relieving to regulation, but just through market competition, uh, you've gotten better environmental products. So I think that the market does take care of a lot of these things. People don't actually want to live in, in human waste, you know, like we actually don't want to do that. So that has been disturbed.

Speaker 5:          02:12:44       Remain recently is how many times I see bill nye on tv talking about climate change.

Speaker 4:          02:12:49       What did he say? Like again, he's, he has the same qualifications either. I mean, here's like a mechanical engineering degree. Yeah. Well it's kind of a comedian. Yeah. I mean I think he is from my childhood. Yes. I believe he was a comedian. Is a standup guy. Yeah. Yeah. And

Speaker 5:          02:13:03       he does. Did you ever see his, his thing with tucker carlson, which was great, tucker carlson kept saying, okay, but you're talking about science. So tell me how much of an effect do human beings have on climate change and what, what is, what's the science? Me. And all he wanted to say was that, you know, are you

Speaker 4:          02:13:21       consensus settle. Yeah, exactly. And like, what is, what is the difference is changing, right? Give me a range. Like it doesn't even have to be an exact number, but give me a range and then tell me, okay, what we have to do in order in your opinion, in order to stop the climate change where it stands or if we can't do that in order to minimize it. What's the actual risk? Also like people keep giving these catastrophic scenarios where it looks like the day after tomorrow and dennis quaid running into subways and shit. It'S like weirder ones. He said was that we were supposed to have an ice age. Now that's not gonna happen like jesus christ. Man. That's good. Yeah. You know, randall carlson has been on my podcast a few times and he's an expert in collisions and asteroid collisions and one of the things he said is he goes, global warming is not great.

Speaker 4:          02:14:02       He goes, but it's way better than global cooling. This is true. This is true in the middle. Cool. And kills everybody. Right? The little ice age was, was not a good thing for the world. The global warm period was actUally a pretty good thing for the world. So I mean this is, thIs is the other thing is that there are costs and benefits to the climate changing which had, which it has throughout time, what are we willing to sacrifice in order to prevent in order to make that seven degrees into six degrees. Right? And just losing some coastline is not. The real issue is far more devastating than losing coast. So I think that if you're going to worry about, if you're going to worry about, you know, the, the emissions problem to worry about the, the uh, the c absorption of emissions, like detoxification of the oceans like that seems to me to be a bigger problem than the climate changing over time.

Speaker 4:          02:14:44       We're pretty adaptable. Like there's a lot of land. Okay. So we move. We have historically in venice, the sea level rises in venice. Every year people are going to move. I mean like, that's just, that's the way It works. And there's this weird idea and it's true in economics. It's true with global warming that where you were born is where you must die, right? And that you can never move. And it's like, well, this is the most mobile society in human history. When you get on a plane and be on the other coast in six hours, it's easier to move than ever before. So if, if we, if you really think that the climate is that bad, first of all, I'd like to ask barbara streisand if she's that deeply concerned about global warming, why she doesn't sell the coastline to state, but it's like, am I going to lose a lot of sleep, have a bunch of hollywood stars lose, you know, five feet off their coastline because we dIdn't kill the industry of the United States and lose $4,000,000,000,000 a year.

Speaker 4:          02:15:31       Like, no. And I'm not really sure that that would have worked that way one way or another. It has been absolutely proven that human beings are having an effect on the carbon dioxide levels. Of course. Right? Of course. Yeah. And there's a greenhouse gas effect. Sure. One hundred percent. So the modeling's been so wrong that like I want it, there's no level of certitude and then there's no level of solution that I know for sure is going to do this. So you're talking about human being suffering in the now for the later and let's be real about this. Like yes, there are a lot of emissions from the United States, but the leading admItter is on the planet right now. We're trying to nydia and they're not going to stop this shit anytime soon like that. That's not gonna happen. Well, there's also this thing that happens where if you even discuss it, you become like a hitler or nazi. You become a climate change denier and once you get locked into one of those labels, you know you, you're a piece of shit. Well this is. Yeah. Nobody wants to be locked into those labels so that they don't really want to have the discussion or the debate. And that's one of the things that I felt like bill nye was not

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       prepared for because I felt like he's so lazy with this conversation because so many people just appease him and agree with it. Yeah. I think that's when tucker carlson was challenging him on it. He didn't have any data to support this argument. He just wanted to sort of like play word games and, and have this. We say, well, you know, you guys on cnn, there was one time when they had some guy on who was saying exactly what we were saying, that the models they have not been proven to be accurate. And that al gore's movie predicted that we'd be underwater in 2014. Mike, didn't it? Yeah. Mean his predictions and emily are not correct. They're not correct at all. And he's made some insane amount of money. He's going to seek out this week. Isn't he like the first billion dollar green guy, like he's made a shitload of money off of giving these speeches and catholic trade.

Speaker 3:          02:17:20       ANd the whole thing is very strange because it becomes this untouchable subject like what We're talking about before with transgender people or with many other subjects become. You can't discuss them. They're not even open to debate or scrutiny. They become locked down. And when tucker carlson was pressing bill now like what is, what are the numbers? Like what is happening? Tell me how much of an effect are we having. And bill nye had nothing on it and it just became stammered. And started getting angry. It was like, wow, this is weird. This is weird to see. I mean, if this is the cause of your life, you know, a little bit more about it than everyone who disagrees is a denier. And I Think the way tucker handler, that was brilliant. I thought it was tucker's best moment I think on a show. Yeah, I think so too.

Speaker 3:          02:18:03       Because he was saying essentially he was like, I'm not denying it. I'm not saying it's. I just want you to tell me how much of an effect tell me exactly. And he had nothing. It's like, so maybe bill nye is the wrong guy. Tend to have there, but I shouldn't be selling himself like you can't have me come on a fucking show and talk about global warming because I don't know anything about it. Or at the very least, bill nye should say, listen, the intergovernmental panel on climate change did this study, right? You can look up the numbers there. I dOn't have them off the top of my head or the numbers of the fucking numbers. You're going to be on one of those shows seven minutes, so everybody in the media is lazy. Nobody. Nobody actually does tHeir prep for a debate or for tv appearances like because the truth is you think you're going to be on for five having done a thousand tv heads at this point.

Speaker 3:          02:18:45       Most people think, okay, I'm beyond for five minutes. I can get through five minutes. Right? Like it would be that bad if I'm on for 10 minutes, how bad can it be? And the answer is you can get parents done nationally in five minutes. If the person knows what they're doing. Well you've done that many people. One of the things that I think is do you talk fast always is like, you're Born this way. My family, everyone in my family talks to the family. Just talks about it because I was wondering if this was a strategy to develop to be really good at those shows. No, no, it's, it's, it's been fortunate that it fits that way, but yeah, even even my kids talk this way. Even of the three year old. This was some people that are just really good at blah blah, blah blah and you, you, you get them in the podcast and you have to like peter shifts.

Speaker 3:          02:19:24       A great example though, after like 20 minutes, I'm like, you want a drink? Let's have some whiskey. We had a couple of glasses of clInk cheers. and we settled down and then he settled into like a normal way of talking, but he's just so used to like force feeding you facts and opinions and ah, it's just, it's such an ineffective way to communicate with those three heads and the one person who is the host throw the Megan Kelly throw in a question and then this person is talking over that person and it's such an ineffective way to communicate. It's one of the things that I do like about long form podcast, like this one or like mine, I, I just, I liked the ability to actually expand on a point on tv. It's like, okay, you have 30 seconds of a point. Excellent. We can make that work for us.

Speaker 3:          02:20:05       It's the only place left that you can do this unless you're making youtube videos and you know, Jordan Peterson is obviously finding out that that's a problem. Yeah. But unless you're doing something along those lines where no one's there but you and you get to expand and express yourself. There's no other form of conversation like podcast where you're not getting interrupted by a commercial. You're just talking and you know as well as I know that conversation sort of evolve and move and they, you know, when I get to know you better, I see how you're thinking better and I kind of have more questions to ask and you expand more and you get to know a person for real and that's just those, those television shows are so there. It's so divisive and that way it's hard for me to watch cable television because of that.

Speaker 3:          02:20:48       I don't feel like I'm getting tons of information that way. Well, cnn had nine fucking people on the other day and it's crazy. The candle on cnn. It's a. It's hollywood squares now. Yeah. Anderson cooper standing, sitting there in the middle and there's people and the people that had just made a diagonal cool and they're interrupting each other and said, excuse me while I talk. You might. You might not interrupting me for a moment. Like their grand standing and trying to have this point they think is going to be a zinger because they wrote it last night and it's just like, oh, the best you can hope for is that you have 30 seconds where you say something that goes viral. That's basically. That's, that's the extent of it. Yeah. well you've done a lot of those. I won't get good at it. I'm good. you're good at it.

Speaker 3:          02:21:26       But it's like we were talking about before that a lot of the people that have debated you that are real, they're really fuckIng lazy. Like, like they have this suppose had passion for something, but when it comes to preparing for this sort of interaction, they're not really doing that for sure. And I think that part of that is there. There are people who are experts on particular topics who could, I'm sure know more about their specialty than I do on a lot of topics to discuss climate change with the person who was like an expert on climate change. I would not know as much as that person. Sure. But you know, there are a lot of people who think they're generalists and have never read a book, you know, lIke I know one fact about one thing and it's that you're a denier and if I know too then I beat you.

Speaker 3:          02:22:06       So that's what. That's. So the climate denier thing seems to me one of the laziest things about the left, and this is not saying that there's not some sort of a real issue with human waste because I think there is, I think it's a, there's a giant issue with plastic in the ocean. There's a giant issue with pollutants in our water system and our air and there's a lot of issues with the side effects of being a person in the industrialized civilization. There's, we burn things, we create poisons and we've got to figure out a way to be sustainable. I don't think there's any denying that by anybody.

Speaker 4:          02:22:40       I think it's also worth noting the market makes these things better in many cases. I mean the fact is that if you look at the areas where, for example, everyone is down on carbon based fuels, okay, fair enough. But if you go to places that don't have carbon based fuels, they're burning animal dung and would there is nothing worse for particulate than, than animal dung and woods. So as we get, and If we, if we did even better than than this, we would get to nuclear power, right? Which unfortunately, a lot of people have been because of unbased fears, like most of france's electricity is provided by nuclear power. and that's about as clean as it gets. So, you know, I, I do think so. It goes dark well till it goes fukushima. Hey, even even in worst case scenario at fukushima, I mean, if you're talking about the, if you're talking about global warming and environmental damage, the amount of environmental damage supposedly done by carbon emissions is a lot larger than fukushima. Right? But the local damage. Oh yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:23:28       that's devastating. That's a disturbing thing that they don't have a way to stop that, that like they've figured out a way to like put a wall of ice around the containment area and that didn't work. It seems so fucking science fictiony and they really don't know what to do. And

Speaker 4:          02:23:44       uh, yeah, I don't know enough about nuclear containment to take off on that one, but let's just say that one disaster in basically there've been three major disaster, right? Chernobyl, three mile island and fukushima, the only one that's happened, the two of those three have happened in the first world, right? Fukushima and three mile island, three mile island basically ended up having no longterm impacts of cliquish. Shame is really the only major disaster in 40 years of industrialized countries using nuclear power.

Speaker 3:          02:24:09       Well, apparently they had some weird meltdowns here at rocket. Don really weren't really discussed. Yeah, don't tell aBout it. Well, they're there, you know, it was all during the sixties, fifties or the sixties when they're involved in the rocket program. But the rocket dyne stuff, um, my friend's dad is a scientist and he was explaining to me the half life of whatever was released in the atmosphere. It's nothing to concerned, but there's a bunch of rocket town was like right there on the street, there was a, a bunch of articles that were written about it, like worrying about people that have higher cancer rates in this area. And you know, but this also like, I think there's a website called the sins of rocketdyne. Really see if you could find that. I think there's a website dedicated to that that people. But there's a lot of cancer just living in cities, man. Like they say that one of the worst environments for a human being is living in a place that has a lot of brake dust. Like if you're living in manhattan and you get your window open, you just inhaling particulates from people there. it is the sins of rocketdyne. But the thing is like, I mean how much more cancer are these people? This is from

Speaker 4:          02:25:18       sometimes the statistics on cancer or hard to to correlate because you'll have groupings that are sort of weird. And that's just because random statistical grouping cabins. So how much of it is due to x factor or why factor. If we knew that then presumably the cancer rates will be going down a lot, but they haven't really in most cases. So it's pretty rare. You have like a lung cancer situation where smoking obviously causes lung cancer. Most cancers like breast cancer, we have no idea why it happens. It's also the value itself. Again, anything that happens in the valley, like when you drive from thousand oaks over the hill and you look down at the value like jesus, that can't be good. Yeah, I hear you. I've been flying into the valley my entire life and every time you fly into the brown gunk that is, that is the valley atmosphere.

Speaker 4:          02:26:01       You think that's not great mean. That is one area where obviously we have gotten better. I mean the smog alerts have gone down tremendously in the last 30 years. Yeah, it's gotten a lot better. It's gotten a lot better. And. But that's also one of the things that Donald Trump is a relaxed. Some of the, uh, the standards, the standard wasn't. I don't know if he really didn't. It wasn't an emission standards. He changed the car emission standards. Maybe a, it's again, I wonder how much of the car emission standards, like there's a, there's actually a pretty thriving debate in the libertarian community, particularly about what the standards are, what drove greater fuel efficiency or whether it was the price of gas that drove greater fuel efficiency. It has. The price of gas has, has risen and fallen. You see people change their buying habits, right?

Speaker 4:          02:26:40       In the nineties, everybody but an suv and then the prices went up and everybody would bought a prius. Well the prius thing is interesting too, particularly like the tesla thing because then you look at the environmental disasters of creating these batteries. Yes. And you're like, whoa, this is not totally green. Yeah. Like there's some weird gray area to it. It's pretty complex. And, and I think that the one thing we know is that there are millions of people all over the world for all of human history who have been living in absolute penury and misery and we now support 7 billion people on the planet and the rate of global poverty has dropped by 50 percent in the last 30 years. A lot of that is technological change, a lot of that is fossil fuel use and so before we, you know, we always have to ban, these are two things that are worth thinking about balancing like, and this is what's again a little frustrating is that sometimes you see people on the environmental left who will say, well this has to be done, or it's the end of the world.

Speaker 4:          02:27:29       It's like, well how about those people in developing countries? How many of those people you're going to say have to live in poverty in order for this to happen? And then on the right you'll see people say, well no environmental regulations at all, just let it all hang out and you know, sometimes the market hash it out and sometimes the market doesn't hash it out. And so, you know, I think a little caution is warranted. I think that's a very reasonable point of view and that's one of the things that I really like about your commentary. I know you're a right leaning guy, but you were very reasonable. You, you make argumentS that are sound and easy to trace. That makes sense. I think I appreciate it. I think we need more of that, you know, and I think it's rare that you find that in a 33 year old guy that's some strange sort of conservative character that travels around a clown sap. So the berkeley thing is going to happen. when is it going to happen? September 14th is the date it's supposed to happen. So good luck with all that and you know, if they cancel it, we'll still go. You got go on a bulletproof popemobile yeah. That, hey, he wears funny hat and said, oh, I said

Speaker 3:          02:28:30       yours is a little low profile though. Yeah, we keep, we keep it on the dl around here. What do you, uh, when you, when you do show up at these places and you see the antifa people and they're screaming and yelling and cheering and that's got to be a surreal thing and it's just you and your thoughts and your opinion. I mean, you're not selling babies. You're not there. Slaughter and dogs and this weekend festival. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          02:28:51       It's weird. I think that, uh, you know, I'm not, I'm not arrogant enough to think that a lot of those people know who I am. I think that what happens is that there's sort of a call that goes out from a select few saying this kkk members coming to campus, go stop him. That's what happened at cal state la. Like when I spoke there, there were actually a couple of professors were telling their students that I was a closeted member of the kkk anymore. Show up wearing a yarmulke. I'm their favorite person. I'm like a charter member. It's, my thing was I was literally in 26. It was hilarious that year I was 2016 was a wild year, so I was. So David Duke accused me of being a far leftist black lives matter accused me of being a member of the kkk and I was the number one recipient to the antisemitism from the, according to the anti defamation league. I was the number one recipient of twitter, antisemitism in the United States for journalists last year. So I do have a little trophy in my house. It's the most hated jews in America, which is a hell of a title that green frog. It is.

Speaker 4:          02:29:45       It's a green frog and then a little model of a gas chamber. It's perfect. Number one, I have by, by a huge margin, by the way, it was like 40 percent of all antisemitic tweets on the internet directly to journalists in 2016 were directed at me personally party. HOly shit. It was a good year. A good year. You know, some years are more productive than others. What did that feel like? Want me to felt like my twitter feed was just a, a dumpster fire. Anytime I recruited anybody I get somebody, I get people emailing me, please don't retweet me because as soon as I recruit someone, they just be hit by waves of these people died off. Yes. And since the election it's really gone down a fair bit, but you know, uh, there, there were some pretty serious death threats. Like I got people calling my cell phone.

Speaker 4:          02:30:27       I had to up my security. I had, I already had a shotgun, but it was, uh, well what, what started it off? probably me quitting breitbart. Uh, so, so when I was, uh, you know, I was not, I was not a trump supporter. I didn't vote for either candidate in this year's election or last year's launch support, uh, in the, in the primaries, cruz cruz. Um, I support him in his position. He was the closest to me politically. um, so, you know, I was not pro trump during the primaries. He didn't earn my vote during the general election. I thought like, there's two ways to look at your vote and this is what I always said to people. I said, vote for who you want to, but for me there's two ways to look at your vote. It's a coupon, expIres November 9th, right? And so either use it or lose it or it's just, it says something about what you are willing to accept and it's possible that there can be election where both candidates suck and you just don't want either of them.

Speaker 4:          02:31:14       So what did you do during the election? I voted down ticket. I skipped the top of the ticket. First time I've ever done that. so I didn't think either of these people was qualified to be president of the United States. Once tRump was elected, then it was like, okay, if he does good stuff, I'll praise him. And If he does bad stuff I'll, I'll hit him as I would any other presidents and uh, so I've been sort of calling balls and strikes with him and some of the stuff like gorsuch I love and some of the stuff like makeup brudzinski's bloody face. I'm not so hot. I'm so uh, that's uh, but yeah, so the, uh, I think what, what led off was, it was a combination of three things. One, I'm jewish too, and obviously so a two, I was working at breitbart and then I quit in the middle of the election cycle after there was that whole, you remember the Michelle Fields incident where a cory lewandowski grabbed the reporter from breitbart or the arm hurt after bruiser.

Speaker 4:          02:31:56       And then the actually bruiser bruiser. I mean he, like, she took pictures, she report it to the cops. It was, you know, unless you, unless you believe she bruised herself, didn't look much like a. I mean when I watched the videos it looked like he just kinda grabbed her arm and he looked like he did. Her body didn't like move, like she was being injured. Yeah, I mean she, lets put it this way, she, that was her account. That was also the accounts have been terrorist at the Washington post was that she was grabbed hard enough to bruise and then she had bruises. So you know whAt, let me as a fight commentator, there's a lot of things that I see live that look a lot worse than when you watch them on video. You know, when people get knocked out like that wasn't much of a punch.

Speaker 4:          02:32:30       I'm like, oh, you have to be there. The example that comes to mind is the, the ali listen punch, right? and find number two. Right? So that's probably, that's probably, It's probably a bad example. But bottom line is that the, that she. There were three, there were a bunch of different excuses that breitbart went through on that. One. One was that she was never grabbed it all and the second was that it was a secret service guy. And then the third was that, that from thought she was a security threat and quarterly he had to protect trump from this 90 pounds soaking wet girl. Uh, and so once breitbart did that, then the real question for me, it was not, you know, what a horrible thing had happened to her. It was much more about as a journalistic entity, do you stand by your reporters or do you stand by the candidate who you support?

Speaker 4:          02:33:11       And once breitbart made clear to me that it, like I already knew they supported trump. That wasn't any great shock, but I was kind of their token non trump guy. And once it became clear that they were willing to sort of sacrifice journalistic credibility on the altar of getting close to trump, then I was out. And then it's no longer a journalistic outlets. I quit, uh, and uh, and that sort of started the ball rolling as far as, well, I really didn't get an isometric responses on twitter before that, uh, not too much. Not too much. So I won't say that breitbart directed at amex. I don't think they did, but I think that there are a lot of people who, who follow breitbart and you know, milo yiannopoulos and they're pissed at me and I had seen me as like an ally and now they saw me as an enemy and this kind of thing.

Speaker 4:          02:33:51       So, and then, you know, this is the war for them, right? Oh yeah. I mean people enjoyed it. Obviously. That's a weird thing about the online hate is how much people enjoy it. It's anonymous. You never get. You never get tagged for it for now. That's fine for us for now, for now. I mean I've said this to a bunch of college students about, you know, the, the outright. First of all, I think it's important to mention a lot of people who say they're all right aren't actually outright just because you like a meme doesn't make you outright, but like there's a group of people who actually like Richard Spencer and jared taylor and the race based identity politics of white supremacy. uh, and those people are actually outright, uh, when the outright is a, is coming after you, then it's not a lot of fun, but there, there are a lot of, there are a lot of young students who will retweet things from like things that are obviously nasty and are going to hurt them in their future career, right?

Speaker 4:          02:34:38       Where the, they'll, they'll be joking around on facebook and using the n word and I'll say to them like, guys, you may think it's funny and 10 years from now your employer is going to find that and you're going to be toast in. There are a lot of people who start to fall into this idea that what you do online is not a mess and it is not, it is not going to remain anonymous. Just a matter of time for a blows. Yeah, I mean crap. Any anonymity in 10 years. I agree. I think that we're, we're moving in that direction and this is actually a thing that botheRs me in general. Like did you follow the entry to the donald sterling saga here? Yeah, sure. So it, it really bothered me that everybody was willing to take donald sterling's team away from him because you said something shitty to his girlfriend about magic johnson when there is no evidence that there's actual discrimination among clients at the clippers. And again, if tHere were actual evidence of discrimination, then sure boycott his team and do what the mba has to do. But like I'm pretty certain that every human beings has crappy things to their intimate loved ones about groups of people and other people. If this now becomes the standard, then I think that we're all toast.

Speaker 5:          02:35:37       Oh, for sure. In his defensive it was like very reasonable. He's like, I was trying to get laid. Like I was just. I was just saying he thought he was alone. He thought he was with her and no one was recording. I mean she was trying to say that she had recorded all of their conversations, that it was a part of her, her job.

Speaker 4:          02:35:55       He's like a senile old guy and he's obviously not with vista viano because she's a nobel prize winning physicist.

Speaker 5:          02:36:00       Like he bought her a condo and a bentley and a ferrari and uses his interview. His interview

Speaker 4:          02:36:06       with anderson cooper was one of the classic interviews of all time I ever saw. Oh my goodness. the moment where he says, because there's a moment where he turns to anderson. Cooper says, henderson, have you ever fallen in love with a woman, an anderson cooper who is, you know, super gay. Fuck yeah. Single request. He starts laughing. He goes, no, I've never had that experience. Well, henderson, when you do fall in love with a woman and he just, he's so unaware. It's like, I'm sorry, like I can't consider this guy. Like he's a kkk, threatening figure. Like the guy can't even find the toilet in the mornings. He's stumBling over his autumn. And like

Speaker 5:          02:36:35       I did, I did about. I'm defending him where I was like, because if you look at what he actually said, everyone's like, he's a racist, is a terrible person. He said, do me a favor. He goes, I don't. He goes, don't take pictures of black eyes. He goes, in the next sentence, he said, I don't care if you fuck them, just don't take pictures of them. I go, in my world, that's pretty reasonable. Like you gotta grow your buying or a ferrari. All always say, just don't take any pictures so you could fuck them. She should just leave well enough alone. You're getting a ferrari out of the deal.

Speaker 4:          02:37:06       No, I think that was. That whole thing was just like it was. It was our capacity to get ourselves outrage so we could show everybody how outraged we work while the president of the nba, whatever the fuck

Speaker 2:          02:37:15       his name is, what is adam starts now, adam silver, the guy that got on tv and was talking about it like it was the most horrific thing that's ever been said by being jim crow at at clipper, at the staples center. He shoUld have gotten on tv and said, look, this is obviously. We know what this was. This is a gold digger and an old man to Stories all the time. He said some stupid shit. Old people say, stupid shit. Old guy. Here's the thing. Don't take his advice. When it comes to race, and he probably should have said, look, but on the bright side he told her she can go fuck black guys, so hey, everybody's happy. What would have been better? Presser the ratings with self righteous and bullshit and let me know a lot of that again is I think that if you look at the nba statistics and who watches the nba, the outsides number of people who watched the nba are black and they spend an outsized amount of time watching it and so you know, donald sterling pissed off a lot of black folks with that, understandably until a lot of people were like ending the nba was like, we're not going to lose our fan base over there.

Speaker 2:          02:38:10       It was a money decision. In other words, I don't think it was a values decision as much as money. While I agree with you 100 percent, but I don't think they had to make that decision that way. I think it could have been in him. They could have been. It could have divested him and put him like put his kids or his wife in charge of the team. Like this idea that you're gonna force him to sell his team, it's going to disband the clippers because there was a tape of an old man saying stupid ass things to a gold digger is. It's pretty much so anyway. And he wound up making more money from that team that he ever would have. So much more valuable. jillion dollars. Yeah. It became much more valuable. Is the whole thing is bizaRre. Yeah, that's it, dude. We just said three hours. Well, that's crazy. I appreciate it. Flew by as great. Well listen, people have been asking for a long time for you to come on, so I'm glad we finally got together and let me do it. Thanks for having me. My pleasure. Let's do it again. Sounds good. Thank you. Thanks ben. See you guys. See you next week. Or girls to non binary folks to everybody all inclusive by.
