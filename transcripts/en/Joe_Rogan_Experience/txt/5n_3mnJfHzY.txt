Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I liked the art bill buildup because so everybody likes the art bell buildup, the art bell sound, you know what did, what did he say from the Kingdom of Nih and Nih? PAHRUMP, Nevada. I used to always love our bell because someone would call in and say, I'm aware wolf, and here we go. Ooh, my interesting. Tell me more. He didn't care. He never. He never called you out on it. Just let you let you ramble. Hit time. Traveler lines. Loved the people. Loved it. I never learned anything from it though. So you're obsessed with Ufo, right? Is that safe to say? It's safe to say, but it's not so much just the Ufo at its self. I mean there. I don't call them that anymore, that we call these advanced aerial threats. There are different threats. You were honed in our word. We weren't supposed to really get into here in the first part of the show.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Did you have a plan? I have a very. I have a very long plan. Detailed plan. We're going to start with my body. We're just going to talk about my body for a lot and. Okay. What do you want to talk about in terms of your body? Well, my body is interesting. It's unique. It changes shape and what I've noticed is it's just changing. It's getting larger and larger, getting wider pending upon what you put in it. But you're off. Can I cuss? Yeah, yeah, for sure. We're on the Internet. You're still fucking fit. You shook my hand. I think it would break my hand. I'm sorry. Yeah, just don't be strong. I didn't mean to. Don't be. You're shaking your hand. Just thought it was a handshake. I know. Well, it's one of those power moves you ever see when trump shakes people's hands and he pulls them in and he's like, yeah, he does do weird shit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       Does weird shit like that. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't mean to do that. It just meant to shake your hand like a man. Well, I, I took it as like know your place motherfucker. Oh this is my show. I didn't think that. No, I'm just joking. Interesting. Um, so how, when did you get obsessed with this aerial threat thing and why? Why do you, why do you call them threats? Uh, we'll get into that I guess. Um, but, uh, uh, I got into when I was in junior high, um, for some weird reason I had like some time off in, um, and I went to the school library and like seventh grade and I was like, damn, I gotta read some Boring Shit, what am I going to read? And I saw this one book and it had a picture of the lochness monster and like a, you have almost, that looks cool.

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       And I read that and I was like, holy cow, these are like real. It wasn't all science fiction. I mean the way the book was laid out, it's like these are like real event and so I'm all, there's no, no way really. And then, uh, when the band started doing it, staying in the back of the van, there were no smartphones. So as we were buying books and um, and I would just lay there, we'd have like 20 hour drives and, and so I started buying books on the Ufo phenomenon and I was, want you to do that. It's a black hole. You're done. Yeah, it's definitely a rabbit hole. You get sucked into it. I, uh, my house, I have a frame poster that's the cover of the Roswell Daily News shows the day after the Roswell crash where it says that the air force came and recovered the wreckage and, you know, the whole deal. I've been obsessed with this shit. I was a little kid.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Yeah. Uh, I think, I think that's a, I think that's by design. I think that this generation is a, was meant to have this stuff come out. Um, but, you know, I can't prove that. That's just my feeling. What would it makes you feel that like, um, because of exactly what you said, there was a lot of people. I don't believe that some of the, um, I don't believe that some of the events happened on accident. You know, I think that, uh, there's been a lot of events that are on purpose, some have been for show, some have been for um, human, there's a variety of, a variety of reasons, but I think a lot of it is a control system that's really pushing humanity in a very specific direction. And uh, so like they've got a timeframe where they had these events take place.

Speaker 2:          00:03:47       Is that what you think? Yeah. And they also time travel, which is different than what people think in like a movie where they sit in a machine and you often, you're in the 19 thirties and you got to go save humanity. Um, when you use the technology, you have a, there's a time a difference between where, what they're doing inside of an article artificially created bubble of gravity of sorts. And then what's on the outside. So if you're on the inside of one of those machines, everything would be skewed more black and white. There'd be like a red shift and everybody would look frozen. So you literally could fly around and grab a coke out of someone's hand and put it in someone else's hand. It's really, where are you getting this from? Will take a wild guess. Look at the people I'm surrounded by, you know, so, so the people you're surrounded by are telling you this is what it is a well, I don't want to get into that, but the people I'm surrounded with, um, and myself, uh, you know, are very close to this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       But the physics, you know, the physicist that's a Co founder of my company to the star, he's a Nobel nominee. He wrote the book on Plasma Physics. He, what's his name? Uh, Hal put off Dr Hal put off and he, he created remote viewing. Do you know what remote viewing is? He's the creator of the CIA psychics spy program. But he also has done like really exotic, advanced forefront propulsion work for the past decades and decades actually. I mean, he, he's deep into like quantum, this and that. So he's the one that actually told me about the red shift. Yeah. And so they have experienced this physically or is this just theoretical or they know that it exists? Like the technology? Yes. Uh, I, I believe that the technology, uh, not only exists, we've figured out how to play with it, but I'm not going to really get into that here.

Speaker 2:          00:05:41       I what, what that is what we're doing at my company though. That is the announcement. So Steve Justice was head of advanced programs that the skunk works and the skunkworks or who built, you know, the famous secret basis, you hear about skunk works, did you know the u two spy plane, the SR seven one blackbird, 1:17 style fighter and it's all groom lake out there, all that kind of stuff. And um, and he literally was in charge of all the advanced program. So, you know, you've got the boss and you got him and um, he came, uh, he just finished his career over there within the past two months. I think it is an. And he was on stage with me when we came out and said, we're going to be building one of these things. So when, when you save it, this, all this technology exists, have they explained this to you or have you seen it physically?

Speaker 2:          00:06:31       Oh, I haven't seen anything physically like that. I'm not, I wouldn't be allowed to go anywhere if that does or doesn't exist. So they've just explained to you that this exists and that this is in the hands of the US government. This I think. No, no, I see. I don't want to get into that kind of stuff. But um, if you don't mind, well why is it that you want to not get into certain things? Well, I don't want to speak act, you know, I represent more than myself these days. So, uh, I definitely have to watch what I say. Who Do you represent when you say represent more than yourself? The team that I'm with. So when you look at the people that are a part of my company, it's under secretary of defense's and defense and senior intelligence service. Is there a list of these people like that we could see?

Speaker 2:          00:07:09       Oh yeah. I thought you guys would have had that list where folks could see it online. Oh yeah, they can go to, um, to the Stars Academy Dot Com. Scroll down and you'll be able to see who they all are. So, so how did you get linked up with all these people? That story might be a better way to start because a lot of people don't know this part of the story and I think you're going to find it pretty funny. Odd as well. But uh, okay. So we'll back up a couple of years. So, um, I have, I was obviously, and you know, I started the band blink and blink went places and um, and then uh, but we always had a weird band relationship, like most bands and we also thought that we would never be big. So we started companies on the side and I had a company that incubated a lot of small startups like software and apparel and hardcore skate surf companies and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       Well, I learned a lot from that and I pulled out and entertainment startup called to the stars and I knew I was going to be doing kind of like science fiction, franchised stories just like Disney, but science fiction for adults. And what that means is, you know, I make a story, I title it, I brand it and I put out the book and I put up the merchandise and I go make a movie, you know, and it's, it's a, it's a vertically integrated kind of model. Well, one of the stories I knew I wanted to put out with secret machines, which was kind of a historical fiction, um, but based on real events about the UFO phenomenon, but I also knew that I knew shit that most people don't know because I've studied it for so long and I happened to put some pieces together that most people don't put together.

Speaker 2:          00:08:45       So before I came out with that book and before I came out with the plan to take that, make major motion pictures and all that kind of stuff, um, I, I knew I needed to ask permission. So I flew, I flew around to places it can't say who they were, but, and they, they listened to my pitch and um, and then I got a, I got a email out of nowhere that says meet us next to the Pentagon at this day and time. And I did that. And from mapping email from just, I just tend to person. No, no, no, I just can't tell you who it's from. And so then I go out the next to the Pentagon. So you just go to the Pentagon. I flew out depending on city. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, dude, this is freaking out. I'll tell you, when I started freaking out, there's more shit.

Speaker 2:          00:09:30       It gets way worse. This is nothing. Um, so that started me out in, out near DC, taking some other high level meetings and there was somebody at a very high level that, that, uh, close the door with many. I says, okay, I'm going to introduce you to somebody and that person comes to San Diego, puts me on the phone with a general. And the general is listening to my little stump speech about what I want to do with this franchise because it was, I definitely didn't want to, you know, I wasn't looking to like force disclosure and I wasn't looking to be rogue and break secrets. I was like, look, I know what's going on here and you guys are doing a kick ass job. And I would have done the exact same thing. Should I have been the guy at the top that had to make some really hardcore decisions 70 years ago.

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       So I'm, I want to support you. I think people are cynical because there's a vacuum. You guys can't say what you're doing. So all these people are just coming up with a bunch of bullshit to say, Oh, you know, they don't want us to know or we can't handle it. Or it's all about oil and money and all this weird shit. And you would put these pieces together and independently I did. And so based on books that you read, yet people think, you know, people think that places like the CIA and the dia, all these intelligence organizations have, um, you know, a monopoly on information. They don't, they get their information from the real world too, you know, uh, they do have access to, to, you know, archives of information. They do have access to some amazing satellite data and stuff like that. But if you're smart and you take your time, you know where to look and you find patterns, um, you can pretty much put together all the same shit.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       They can kind of, you know. And that's what I did. And so when I pitched what I wanted to do, he said, come up and meet me tomorrow. And so I flew up to NASA, actually a Nasa Ames and had a two hour meeting there. And after two hours, that person says, he looks me in the eyes, I'm going to introduce you to someone else. And he did. And so I got on the phone with this person and this person, you know, I'm a skeptic, I'm a skeptic. And then at the end of the conversation he goes, um, he goes, fly out and see me. And so I did and that's when things really started happening. So I mean now I fly out to this airport and I, I sit at a table in a restaurant at the airport, no one's in there and this gentleman sits down and the waiter comes up, he waves off the waiter and he

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       looks me in the eye and says it was the Cold War and we found a life form and that's when I started shitting my pants because I know a lot about this stuff. But you always wait to talk to somebody that is one of the inside people you always want to have sits down at a restaurant with you at the airport and tells you that they found a life form. Yes. And during the Cold War, during the Cold War and everything that they did in every decision they made at the time was because of the consciousness of the Cold War. Why's this guy decided to meet with you in an airport? Because the only way you meet with these people, the only way you ever would have anyone talk to you is if you can provide a service that they need. And my service was pretty interesting to them because I said, look, you guys, you know, you struggle with saying, disclosure, you want to tell everybody everything, which I don't think everyone should know everything.

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       Um, and then you say they can't handle it, so don't tell them anything, you know. And I'm like, there's, there's a middle road there and here's the way I would do the middle road. And it resonated with them, you know. And so we had a pretty epic conversation for two hours. Why you like, why, what is it about what your message was? You're idea was, um, the, made them something to tell you some top secret shit that they've tried to keep away from the American people. When you tell your guy who was like a big celebrity who's in a huge rock band like you and just say, Hey, meet me in an airport. I'm going to tell you about a life form that we found during the Cold War. Because you're famous or because you know things? No, because I have a service, so it's, it's not a, it sounds easy when you play it like that.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       But if service, a service, like what can you do for them that they need help with communication. They don't have a way to make a movie a book. They don't know. They don't have a way to make documentaries. They don't have a way to go on, on a big show like this and communicate with young people. They don't do that. And nor should they, they're, they look at you gotta. Look at what they're doing. Um, so they look to you for a spokesperson role. I wouldn't say spokesperson communication, role, communication, role. It makes sense. They would give some information to you and you would get it out to people. And now why wouldn't they do it themselves? Because they wouldn't have the same platform. They don't have the same platform. And the other reason is as people have tried to do movies and stuff like this, but none of none of them know.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       I was fortunate enough to, to know the core story. And most people don't explain that then if you don't mind going back, like you said, that you were able to put things together that other people weren't one of those things. Essentially it's the book secret machines where you have a lot of private finance, you have some world bankers and you have, um, a lot of people internationally working together to figure out a plan of how to, how to push back against something that's been coming here for a very long time. But using off the books, finances and using mechanisms that, that we're not totally aware exist. And what people have to realize is, you know, they,

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       the UFO phenomenon isn't a phenomenon. There's the universe is fucking gigantic and there's life everywhere, every fucking where and, and, and there's a lot of life that's way more advanced than we are. And just like voyager left our solar system, a little dinky satellite from the seventies there. And just like, my company's going to be building, you know, this, this electromagnetic craft that really can do the same thing. The time that I've been telling you about. Other civilizations have that too, which means you can traverse those distances of space and what you have to think about is what happened when we first discovered that and what did we do about it? And there's no, you know, you've got to look at 47 in a very peculiar way. Ninety days after the Roseville event with CIA was created, the air force was separated from the army. The National Security Act was created and all those things are mechanisms to start learning more and to start getting private industry off the ground.

Speaker 2:          00:15:48       So they're going to do with World War II. You think it had to do with aliens? Oh, I absolutely think it. Well, both because what, uh, what I believe crashed at Roswell was, um, I believe it was German from Argentina, but it had hallmarks and technology based on alien technology. So we put out a story saying it's alien and then we put out a story saying it's a weather balloon, but the real thing it was we didn't want anyone to guess and that's why we put those two things out there. And that's Kinda how they do it. I think they did that with the moon. It's like, you know, we went to the moon and then they put out this meme kind of thing, like we can't, we, we didn't go to the moon, but I didn't want people really going, well, what's on the moon that, you know, so these things are managed until they can figure it out because you've got a bunch of normal dudes in suits sitting at a big table like this and it's their fucking responsibility to figure this thing out and this shit is monumentally big.

Speaker 2:          00:16:48       Um, but back to how they manage this. Then how these regular dudes without access to communication like you have, how have they managed to disseminate this information and, and, and sort of confuse everybody. I think. Well, I can tell. I don't know how they did it. I do know that they infiltrated Ufo groups. That was the very first thing they did in the fifties, sort of like how FBI agents and undercover cops infiltrated occupy Wall Street yet pretended to be radical hippies and started fights. Yep. They did that. They get access to what the civilians are learning. How information transfers from one group to another and then they start deflecting all their knowledge and putting in leaks and this and that and getting them off the main track, not because of disdain for citizens and not because of any other reason than picture isis. We don't know what Isis is.

Speaker 2:          00:17:38       They got a nuclear bomb and we caught a guy trying to sneak in this mom. Right. Are they going to stop and come sit on your couch and tell you all about it? No. And if you're like on the radio and there's all these people going, oh my God, we're gonna die. Obama, Obama, Obama there. Hold up a second. You know, you're not going to fucking die, but we need to learn more about this and we've got to figure it out before we sit down and talk to you about it. So what was the connection though specifically that you had figured out that they knew, that you had figured out that people hadn't put together? Well, let me just. Okay, so let me go back to my story. So I put out this book and this book deals with a book called the secret machines and it deals with secret, you know, international finance, private industry.

Speaker 2:          00:18:22       I'm a secret space program, uh, and a bunch of other things that your research is both. What do you mean? How'd you get the information? I was just 25 years of reading shit and watching videos and studying physics and studying, you know, the secrecy acts and all that kind of weird shit, you know, you put it together and a lot of it's bad information. But, uh, after a long time I realized I just realized what was going on there. I just, I've studied enough of, of international finance, some mechanisms that happen after World War Two, what the Nazis were doing technologically that no one really talks about to this day. There were a hundred years ahead of us, uh, about what their guys did at the end of the war and South America that's in the paperclip. Paperclip was like, there's two levels of paperclip. Paperclip is, is the operation that brought over all these ex Nazis into NASA and into all of our aerospace programs.

Speaker 2:          00:19:18       Why did we do that? Well, because they knew some shit that was very important and we said there might be a bigger issue out there to deal with. So why don't we saw with the devil or side with someone bad because there might be a devil out there. It's that kind of thinking. So they come in and thought it was about competing with Russia to try to advance rocketry. The, I believe that there was, um, you know, I believe that there's a reason with the cold war never got hot is because we're working with Russia on this specific issue. You think the reason why the Cold War never turned into an actual war. So we were saying yeah. So it had nothing to do with the fact that Russia was a communist empire and essentially, no, it did spent them and they really did, went under and collapsed.

Speaker 2:          00:20:02       Yeah. But there's different, there's different levels. It's like when someone goes, you know, the US government did this. Well, what do you mean? What does that mean? Does that mean the CIA did it or the Dod did it? Or Homeland Security did it. You're dealing with the. It's a trillion dollar organization. It's like if somebody's in apple leaks and iphone, you know, are you going to say, oh my God at apple is doing. Apple is like, well shit, we're a $800,000,000,000 company. We have so many things going on worldwide. It's impossible to say. The entire organization believes one thing and the government's the same kind of the same kind of way. It's just like, that's just a word. The US government's two words, right? All right. Three years, four years. How do we want to count this in the United States government? Three. Three, yes. Okay. US has got a, you're going to find that you got to figure this shit out.

Speaker 2:          00:20:49       But um, and you have many, many layers of what's going on and you have some people worried on technology. Some people worrying about what's happening that happening to the civilian population. You have some people worrying about, um, you know, how to keep everything afloat, how to keep everything going. And you have a whole bunch of weird military excursions and they're bumping into each other and, and all these people aren't read in to what's going on with the UFO thing. So as all that shit. So who gets read in the. That's a good question. If I had to guess. I'm very, very senior technical bras and rockstars and Rhonda wasn't red in trust me. They didn't tell you anything? No. Uh, they possibly did, but I wasn't read and read and I wasn't brought into a skiff and they said this is what's going on even though I've been in a skiff a few times.

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       Okay. You want to skip this? A boat? A skift is a, is a special compart mentalized information facility. It's, um, it's, we're top secret shit can be discussed. I thought maybe they talk on boats because nobody can hear you. They do that too. They do that. They do that. They actually do. Because you can sweep for bugs on boats a lot easier than you can on a building. Make sense? Yeah. Yeah. So they tell you what. Okay. So I'm sitting at that restaurant and says he found a live forum where they found a life forum during the Cold War. And I, and I said, well, if find it, oh, I didn't ask him that question. Get many places. I did one time bring up. I said, you know, I'm thinking about talking about what the crash and the late forties and they go, why just that one?

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       That was the answer. So I had to figure out a language to talk to these guys. Do you ever think that maybe this guy is bullshitting you or he's crazy? No, fuck no, no, you got it. That's what you got to hear the whole story. So, um, okay. So I'm sitting with them, we talk about a lot of things. I bring up the incidents with our nuclear weapons. I bring up the incidences, a, a few other things that I want to get into. And um, and he goes, what do you need to do your project? What do you, what are you looking for? And I said, well, I need advisors, you know, uh, I need people that are from different areas. And the government, because everyone has their own perspective, you know, you have people at the National Reconnaissance Office that have a perspective based on the satellite feeds they're getting and these things are coming in and out of the atmosphere.

Speaker 2:          00:22:59       Then you also have people from the agency that are worried about in collecting information of what's going on with people in different countries and here, uh, but then you also have engineers that have a perspective on how the technology is made and what that might mean because there's a lot of consciousness stuff that, that falls into this category there. So there are satellites that track them coming in and out of the atmosphere. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. What kinds of satellites are these? Uh, how the fuck, I don't know, usually forward looking for red, but I don't know what spectrum of the infrared they're looking at. So there is some sort of a camera or some sort of a detection device that they have in the atmosphere just to check for Ufo. I don't know if it's just for you iphones, they can pick up very, very specific heat signatures and they have algorithms because what you have is a satellite is a device that can pick up what you, what you program it to pick up.

Speaker 2:          00:23:56       Now you know, you put a sensor on there but you got to tell the sensor what to do. So if the sensor says, look something traveling at this speed with this kind of heat, you know, you gotta record that you got to focus on it and that's what we call an icbm. But if something comes in and zigzag stops and turns left and traveling 10 times faster than that, we need you to record that and focusing on that as well. But if something just as moving low and it's only going 300 miles an hour and it has these big wings and Alo, whatever, they're all just a plain, you know. So the, what it captures is based on, you know, how it's programmed in the first place, but we can differentiate between media rights and. Absolutely, yes. Absolutely. So okay. So how often are these things coming into?

Speaker 2:          00:24:37       Our Atmosphere, oh shit, I don't know, but I, I've had quite a few discussions. I'm, one of the people I've been, I've been in contact with, one of my advisors for was from the national reconnaissance office, high up, high, high up and um, they call it episodic visits. That's all I know. Episodic have time periods where they, like, there was, I saw a paper where they semesters, I figured out, um, the department of fence figured out a physicist there, an algorithm of how to compute when the things fly in, in collect smaller ships like mothership small ships. What, what at what longitude and latitude in, in what essentially what orbit it would land at when it would collect these other machines. And um, so they tested that and in all I know is it was successful. They would think this is happening on a very frequent basis.

Speaker 2:          00:25:28       Well, let me tell you the rest of the story. So I, I, uh, and this is, it's important because you'll see 'em. So he goes, what do you need? I said, I need to advisors. And then, uh, so next thing you know, I leave and two weeks later, Bam, Bam, Bam, my email starts. I have all these admirals, all these generals, no, no intelligence people other than, other than bras that were connected with the national reconnaissance office. But, um, Nashville office has half air force and half CIA. Um, but they're all, they're all military. And so I start talking to them, I start meeting with them, I fly out to Colorado Springs and there's a general and a colonel and they look at me and they said, uh, they said, okay, do you need anything else? Are you good? And I said, well, I think you guys should talk to the defense intelligence agency.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       And they go, why? I'm all, I just don't want to upset them. I want to make sure everyone's kosher with what I'm about to do. And uh, the kernel looks at me and he goes, do you ask your dad for permission after your mom's already given it to you? And I go, no. And he's all, you've been given permission, shut the fuck up and get to work. And I was like, alright. So I did, so I go out and I put the book out there and I started doing national radio, like the art bill, so coast to coast. Ordinarily I do all that stuff. Next thing you know, I get approached by somebody with a, at a certain agency and that guy comes to San Diego and puts me in a small room, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       and I got a, what you would call interrogated for two days straight saying, um, we need to know who the fuck you are. You know, shit you shouldn't know. And uh, what like what specifically should you not have known? I don't know what the book, what's in the book, everything I've been telling you today when you're dealing with there, there is a, there is a concerted international effort to deal with this stuff. And that was in my book and that is, it's not like Roswell crashed and it was not like, you know, like all the typical Ufo Shit that people dwell on isn't the story. It's just that there's something crashed or someone saw got abducted and saw this or someone pulled a little piece of metal out of their body, but no one's put together what we're doing about it because our, our, our countrymen since World War Two aren't stupid, is what set them off there.

Speaker 1:          00:27:37       Like, what was the thing that you said that you should not have known the A in my book, it is my belief, uh, that we have an incredible, um, we've made incredible strides creating a assets to deal with this stuff. That's, that's my belief and I'm not speaking for my company. That's just nonsense. Yeah. I mean some sort of government agency that has been designed or other international international. Okay. So some sort of an international collaboration to deal with the threat of alien life and that was enough that they pulled you aside from wouldn't let you go for two days and just. Yeah. So it was the, it was more, it was an interrogation, but it was a pretty heavy, heavy debriefing of how I got to where I was. And it's not like they didn't let me go home. This took place at a hotel near my home, but they made you sit down and talk to them.

Speaker 1:          00:28:31       Oh fuck. Yeah, I had. There was a six of them I think six until they let you leave and go to sleep and then come back, get something. Came back, spent another eight hours because I wasn't rogue. I wasn't like trying to hide anything. I was trying to explain to the. How did you have all this free time though? What do you mean? I mean, have you ever like if somebody said, hey, we're going to have you in a room, we're going to talk to you for two days. I'm like, dude, I don't have two days or that's, that's well that's. Maybe you don't, but if you do, I'd fuck you out. When you have these people that want to get ahold of you, you don't run. I'm not saying run. I'm saying like, what are you guys looking for? Like you, they're going to just sit you down and ask you questions for two days because you put together this idea that somehow or another there's some sort of an international collaboration deal with the threat of million life.

Speaker 1:          00:29:11       No, they, they, they looked at it. They didn't know they thought I was at snowden. They thought I was. They thought there was a group of people leaking classified information. They didn't know that you're from blink one 82. They didn't know that you like a huge. They don't care about rockstar. That's what they don't understand. They don't care about who I am, they just care about the material. Right. But it should take them like three seconds to realize you're not Edward Snowden, you're a rockstar. But I, but I'm saying some pretty provocative shit. You got to realize no one else has

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       gone up there and talked about, you know. Once again, I, I'm in a tricky spot right now because a lot of what happened back then, you know, I can't really get into now because of the positions and the things I'm involved with, but read the book. And so it was just because you printed this stuff in the book that they wanted to pull you aside and talk to you about this for two days. And I was all over radio and talking about it and I was saying some other crazy shit that I can't repeat. So people listening, if they want to go back and look at those interviews, that's a better way to. Okay. So you had said something in those interviews that you can't say again because they told you to stop talking about it. Absolutely, yeah. They tell you to stop talking about the fact that you can't talk about it.

Speaker 2:          00:30:20       No, I mean, I don't think that's the issue. They, the more of the issue was what are you trying to achieve? And once they found out who I was working with, they were like, Holy Shit. And they only found that out when wikileaks broke into John Podesta's emails in my. I was having video conferences and conference calls with, uh, he was Obama's senior advisor at the time. So the Wall Street Journal broke the story. Like, what's this rock star talking about Ufos with Hillary. Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, no, he was Obama's senior advisor so I had nothing to do with Hillary, you know, so we were setting these up and when that broke I had to call up my partner from the CIA and I said, you know, I got to say, I know I got no, I can talk to you a little bit more about who these people are.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       And um, and that's where I gained a really large amount of credibility with them, but also where they realized that we got to figure out a better way to do this and what you see is me and some very important people coming together to do something that I think is really beneficial to society. But a lot we have a lot of work to do because a lot of people think they don't know what to think of it. At first they thought I was nuts when I was talking about my book. I'm all, Oh God, these advisors, you know. And then all of a sudden the Wall Street Journal broke this story and there's all these multi star generals and head of some really big aerospace companies. And then, then the big news organizations were like, Holy Shit, this is, this might be real. A lot of kids still don't know and they're having fun on the Internet.

Speaker 2:          00:31:53       Um, and then I came out a couple of weeks ago on stage with all these people. Now it's like now all the big huge. I'm dealing with some crazy big mainstream press that, that we're trying to keep at bay for a variety of reasons. Um, but yes, it's all true. And what to the stars is really after is how do we, how do we bring the public in on this and work together to, to communicate and educate this stuff. How do we bring the technology out of the shadows and build it for the world? Um, and how do we, uh, you know, tell the story in documentaries, nonfiction, fictional works over a period of years. And if we do that, the public owns it. The public has a say, they're a part of it. And then people will start to understand over time why they did what they did.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       They didn't lie to people, uh, just out of like ego. It's they are like, okay, there's this group called Isis and they're here and we need to understand them and we need to fucking figure it out quick. Uh, but the problem is these are extraordinarily advanced civilizations that have been coming here forever. That's why it's all in all the ancient fucking scripts and texts and carved into the rocks and all that shit. Um, but trying to figure it out, trying to connect the dots and trying to. I mean looking at debris that they probably still have in a warehouse going, we have no fucking clue how to, how to make this or back engineer this stuff. I mean there's a piece of metal from a crash that I've seen and I've seen the science on it and it's, it's so it's atomically aligned and it's layered and multi, like 80 layers within just a few microns of purities of metal that, that aren't even in our solar system.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       And they think it needs to be made in, in an area where there's no gravity. So number one, it has to be made in space. Number two, even if we were to create a machine that can potentially do some of this stuff, three d printing layers of different metals that have obscene purities, it would cost hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. We don't even have that. Why did they think it was made without gravity? Because, uh, I think it's the atomic structure. So what happens is, is when you radiate it with Terahertz, it loses mass, something weird, it resonates, some kind of harmonic and then it gets lighter and if you hit it with enough terahertz, it'll float. So we're going to be showing people this stuff. We're going to be bringing out the hardware. Some of the hard work will be bringing out implants that are going to be bringing up videos.

Speaker 2:          00:34:23       We're going to be bringing in showing people this actual physical piece of metal that was constructed in a zero gravity environment and space. And if you hit it with enough energy, it becomes weightless. Now, I wouldn't say wait list. I don't know if we can make enough energy to do that. But yes, that is our plan in not only show the experiment. So if you can't give it enough energy to make it weightless, can you give it enough energy to reduce the mass? Yes. So it weighs less. Yes. And you can prove this. Yes. And that's why I didn't have a scale. And you can put this piece of do scale. I'll do you better. It's not, it's not even that. It's warping the space time continuum around the objects. So you shoot. What you can do is you can shoot an electron over it.

Speaker 2:          00:35:04       Why? It's why it's not a single electron and you collect it in time that how do you shoot a single electron final? I'm not physicists. They just do this shit. That's what they do. So. And I was actually on a phone call today about it. I talked for about 45 minutes in the car on the way up here about some of the, some of the. How would they even be able to regulate whether or not they have a single electron will do. Fuck. They're doing crazier shit than that at cern. At cern, they're taking particles of atoms and they're speeding them up to light speed. Almost lights. Yeah. And slamming them into each other. So I'm not too worried about electron electrons and photons. Ms Dot building.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       That's, I think it's sirens like 10 miles in the lab. Have you seen an electron microscope? Right. It's like the size of half of this too, but I'm saying they're launching a single electron at this thing. I think that's what they do. Yeah, they do that with photons too, by the way. I read, I read a really cool study about single photons and consciousness was interacting with it. Just just by thinking it was changing the way the photon went. It's crazy. So what happens is, is you shoot this electron and you know how fast it is to travel over this piece of metal. Then you, then you radiate it with terahertz and then you shouldn't mean radiated with time. You're, you're your electrifying and charging the piece of material noted terahertz. It's, it's a, it's a high frequency wave. I don't want to pretend I know that much about it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       I just know that the earlier tests were with radio waves like rf and uh, and they need to do terahertz. So I, I don't know much more than that, so and so by radio, by shooting terahertz at it, the piece of metal can lose mass and then when you shoot an electron over it, it'll be a different time than the other one when it's not turned on. Does that make sense? No. The time it takes for an electron to go over the piece of metal. What's that? Jamie's been terahertz imaging, laser guided codes, advanced single pixel tele terahertz imagery, and this be the images sampled upon instructions from a laser, a the terahertz light passes through the object and then see the information is collected to reconstruct the image. Look at that. So with this stuff, just an imaging technique, you're timing how fast it takes an electron to move over the surface of the metal.

Speaker 1:          00:37:19       Then you charge the metal and then your timing the exact same thing and there will be different times and the positive result is that it lost mass so it traveled faster or slow or whatever the hell is supposed to happen. So, and so I would imagine that this, just this piece of metal, if it exists, would be kind of game over if you brought this piece of metal to the most advanced scientists and metallurgy or whatever they would be that would understand this kind of shit. Yeah. And it had already been there. But the problem is, is there anywhere online where people can read about this, there actually is. There's some, some of this stuff, not this piece in particular that came out as arts parts on arts bell a long time ago and there are different layers of business and magnesium. But I uh, but this one came from a crash in 48, not 47 and I know nothing more about it, but I don't think it's anything that can come in here with the chain of custody and say this came from air force or something like that. You know, I don't know who has this. So you're going to bring this and demonstrate this to people. Yeah. And the reason is, is because we need to. We're also going to show, um, videos that just got declassified from our most advanced systems, I think they call it the Aegis Aegis system. It's a radar system and forward looking for red of Ufo is have those in possession

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       actually already. And so we're going to show the videos that just, I mean the first time in history, by the way, that videos of Ufo iphones have been declassified. There's been leaks and there has been people catching shit on their phones, but I have all the chain of custody, all the documents and everything and we just got those a few weeks ago and there's a shitload more common. And so we'll release the videos and we'll show the experiment as a proof of concept. So everyone knows the shits all rail because right now they're just looking at a drawing and they're looking at this guy from the skunk works, you know, and just going, how the fuck are they going to build a machine that plays with time and plays with the fabric of space time. And so we have to kind of educate people and say it's possible. It's possible.

Speaker 2:          00:39:13       And yeah, that's it. They're advanced electro gravitt. Gravitic propulsion is that. I say that electrogravitics gravitic. So what that does, what the machine does that we're building is there's A. There's an electromagnetic wave that is the foundation of everything, of all mass, of everything. Like it's. Some people call it zero point energy, some people call it a the vacuum energy, but like one inch of air could power the United States for like hundreds of years kind of thing or maybe more. So what they got to do is isolate very specific atoms to where all the noise of all matter and cell phones and everything that's going on on earth can be, can be separated from this one Adam. And if you can do that with the right material, you can get access to that electromagnetic wave that's powering the atom, the, the, the invisible wave pattern that that's under everything of all existence.

Speaker 2:          00:40:09       And once you do that, it's not like splitting an atom. This is the power behind the atom. It's extraordinarily dangerous, but it's also what will turn that thing on and it'll turn into a ball of light and just disappear. And I could show you a video of, of something doing that that's actually on youtube, you know, told me what it is. Who Goal I would. I would have to, I could search it for a second. How about this? Well, there's no commercial breaks. Is there? No. Oh fuck. Just search it up. I'll just describe it. You know what, if you type in, um, Astra, uh, the tr three, be astro, tr three B and I'll walk over there and walk over there for a second show in which one is. Yes, go ahead.

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       Gone to so we can all talk to each other. So what you want to do is come down here and do your people get to a. there'll be able to see it. We'll put it up on the screen. So what, what? This is why I don't really want to tell you what it is. What I want you to watch it. I'll find it for you. Just takes me a second. There's a bunch of bullshit. This is the craft by the way. And if you spell it right, astro, that's why. Sorry. Astra Astra. Not Astro. You're typing in at home. He's got to get. We got to get me. Sure. It's the right one.

Speaker 1:          00:41:39       We're looking on youtube. Ladies and gentlemen, if you're in your car right now, going, what the fuck is going on in this show? Most the vast majority of the people just listened to this show. So for the people that are just listening and you want to go check it out, t are 38, Astra Aurora project through s a f o three b. sorry. This is the craft in secret machines, but that's all I'm going to say. This thing is floating in the air. It'll take a few seconds till they turn on the engine.

Speaker 1:          00:42:14       Well, it looks pretty bad ass. I don't wait. You can see little lights dancing around on the bottom, but I think this was leaked on purpose because the guy's making a just hard enough to see moving the camera around in and out of focus. It's got like he's barely focusing soy. That looks like a drone. Well, it looks small to. It's not. It's pretty big. I would think that one's about 40 feet. Really? Look, see the tail fins on the back. That's how you know it's not alien per se. It's built off. I think technology that came from there, but you know, they don't need vertical tail. Stabilize that big light. Okay. This is the engine they turn it on. So right now they're at. They're accessing that energy I told you about now and watch what happens.

Speaker 3:          00:42:57       It's gone.

Speaker 1:          00:42:58       There's a pilot in that. If that was in a movie, I'd want my money back. This movie can suck my Dick. Why? Why? Like so fake. Oh that don't look fate. What does that tr three beers. These ones, the other ones are the same one, but these ones are stacked and that's a drone that came out of one. That's a drone. The small one is have the little thing that came out the side. Yeah, but if you. You can look up black triangle Ufo and find hundreds of these videos. So these are a people look civilians that are getting this from the ground filming this. I don't know. I don't know where this one came. One came from. This is not the same account as the last video. Different video ended up next because it's probably a tr three wii video. How many views is out $474,000.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       Now there's sundry. There's so many people know now. There's hundreds of these out there, but what separates from the other one? But everyone thinks everyone thinks I'm it's alien and that's not my belief. So you think this is something along the lines, like when they had the stealth bomber program, they were experimenting with these things. What do you think of Robert Lazaro? Do you think that guy's real? I'm putting out his autobiography. So you do think he's legit and you should read his book? Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. He's a fascinating character, right? He is. He is. His story is really interesting to where he really fucked up though. So for the people that don't know that are listening, he's a guy that came out. He's the reason we know about area 51. He literally is, is, is the guy that broke the story of its existence. He got brought in for a job and that during the they said we have another

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       idea for you, and they put them in a, a place he claims had all these disks and he was on a back engineering team as a physicist. Um, but what happened was they rushed him in there because per his story, they tried to cut into one of the propulsion devices and it exploded and killed a bunch of scientists. So the Nevada test site, which is the area where area 51 and all that stuff is released a statement that they were just doing a small little nuke test, but it was really because of this thing. And so they rushed him in there without doing all of his background checks because it takes six months to a year. And, uh, during those background checks, he was already working on this stuff. They, um, they found that his wife was going a little haywire because he couldn't tell her what she was, what he was doing.

Speaker 2:          00:45:14       And he would leave in the middle of the night. He'd be gone for a week and she was getting fed up. And so she started having an affair and so they're listening in all the phone calls and checking them out and I kind of go on his home. Life is unstable, so they stopped calling him to come into work while they figure it out. He knows. I mean he's working next to a guy with a machine gun. He knows that, uh, that this is no fucking joke. It no one knows what he's been doing. And he thought he did something wrong. So as the nervous individual he is, he runs to his friends and says, this is what I've been doing. This is what I've been working on. There's alien craft. It's over here at groom lake. And the tests are every Wednesday night at 8:00. And his wife goes, Holy Shit.

Speaker 2:          00:45:52       And his friend goes, Holy Shit. And he goes, come on, I'll show you. It's, they drive three hours north of Vegas, outs on public land. And they videotape and watch these ufos come up and be tested and dart around and disappear. And he goes, that's the one I'm working on. And it's almost like, well, how did you know what time? Because I'm working on it, well, he does this three times. I think it was three times and on the third time they got caught because there's, I've been there, there's security that, that travels those mountains. You always hear about those guys out there and area 51, when they caught him, they were like, holy fuck. He's. He's like, what the fuck is he doing? You know, why is he telling everything? So he runs to the new station with George Knapp who another, another, um, he's a host on coast to coast and he tells him what he's doing and he just goes live on Las Vegas news and it caught like wildfire fire, uh, across the world.

Speaker 2:          00:46:40       And so then these guys grabbed him, put him in a room, put a gun to his head and said, when we told you not to say anything, we didn't mean say everything, you know. And uh, he got really scared. They started fucking with them. I was actually at a meeting two nights ago talking about some of the things they did. One of the things he did, he went to a gym he used to. He didn't have access to a lot of guns, but if for some fucking reason he had like an Uzi, it was in his glove compartment. He goes to a gym and he comes out and his car doors are open, the glove compartment is open, and the Uzi just sitting on his chair, he got a, he got shot out on the freeway and they erased a bunch of his records. Uh, and he still to this day really nervous about it. He, he always claimed he put for a while. He claimed he had, part of this is what I will say. He claimed the energy source was an element that was very heavy and it was like on a pentium or something like that. One 15 element and a 25 years ago he talked

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       all about it. He's. And then literally three years ago, maybe four, they added it to the periodic table. What is this stuff called again? I think it's called underpin am. It's one element. One 15. It's on. And that's the other thing is people don't realize, Holy Shit, 25 years ago, he says, this element comes from a binary star system and it's really heavy. There's a certain isotope that stable, they'll find it. And then all of a sudden, I remember one day I was driving my car and I heard it like on CNN new element added to the periodic table. I was like, Holy Shit, you know. But it's pretty interesting. Crazy story. Well, they erased his history. What is the claim that he had raised his educational record? Well, I think he might have people. I don't know if I think this is, I don't even, I don't know, I never researched it, but people that I know that have researched, I think he might have kind of upgraded his residence, his resume a little bit and maybe he didn't go to mit.

Speaker 4:          00:48:23       That was the claim. But they also said that he really did work for a. what's that

Speaker 1:          00:48:29       New Mexico? Uh, well, Lawrence livermore and jpl. Jpl, jpl in Pasadena. Yeah. But, well, whatever it was, it was in New Mexico that they had found that he actually did work in the building even though they tried to say that he didn't. Oh yeah. Maybe I did something with somebody and however much of his store was true, always gets fishy when you find one thing that's not true like that he didn't go to mit and Freedom Stanton, Stanton Friedman, who's a very famous UFO researcher. He's one of the main guys arguing that Bob was ours full of Shit. Yeah. You know, what's interesting is there is, there is a, um, I know that guy that did all the research on that and I know that guy that studied it for decades and uh, he's actually writing a forward on the book. It's the journalist has one like eight peabody awards and Emmys and shit. But uh, George Knapp, who I told you about and he's just got, like, he could speak for hours on that entire funds on the coast to coast show, right? He doesn't like a couple Sundays each month. And I find that element. What does it element 1:15, is that what it's called? Popular mechanics article about it.

Speaker 4:          00:49:43       Welcome element 1:15 now. What's your real name? Researchers create element 1:15, the lab for the second time over the first time over all in the first time in a decade, paving the way for its official status as a member of the periodic table. And so google, Bob Lasar element 1:15 because I would think that if he knew that like that long ago, like that alone would make people want to take them more seriously. All the stuff that he said. Well first of all, we know that there was a groom lake. We know that there is an area 51 we know they denied its existence and so they wanted to expand the perimeter to till they wanted to because people would sit on a ledge and they would watch all these test flights of whatever the fuck they had. Whatever it was they were doing, whether working on stealth bombers, whatever it was, people would film this and so they wanted to

Speaker 1:          00:50:27       expand the perimeter of prohibited area. And so in doing so, they had to admit the existence of the base itself. I believe that was in the nineties, right? Um, it was in the nineties. They expanded the perimeter. Something else that the government had to do is they had to admit you have photos are real because there was a um, some military people look at it. Yeah. He talks about 1:15 all through this year. This Jamie doesn't say the video on the bottom. What is it? When was this put out? This video? Well, this one is 2015, but the video is taken on vhs. Holy Fuck. This is 1990. Maybe it's on the Scifi channel. Back when it was spelled Saifai. Yeah. Everyone uses a lot. That's why f Y. Yeah. That's old as fuck. Yeah. Played some of that though, because that dude's a trip because he's one of those weird guys where if you're, even, if you're a skeptical guy, you listen to bibles are talking like sky is obviously smart as fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:51:25       Here we go in the top of the reactor, and the base of the reactor apparently is something similar to a cyclotron. If the particle accelerator a, a particle is accelerated the high speed and then deflect it up a small tube and it's aimed at the 1:15, this transmute the 1:15. Uh, similar to the way we do that in a normal particle accelerator, this causes a reaction or radiation emission that we really haven't seen before. Um, it produces annie matter. This Annie matter is guided down, attuned to, and reacts with a gap when matter in any matter, react, they convert to 100 percent energy. This energy is converted, heat energy is converted to electrical power, and the reactor itself. This was done through a thermoelectric converting. And this electrical power is used to power other subsystems on the craft. Though there is no wiring as we would know it also. That's almost a byproduct of the reactor. The reactor also sets up a gravitational wave from the 1:15 being bombarded this gravitational wave, it was present at the top of the reactor and it is essentially guided in the same way microwaves are guided through tune tubes and uh, this goes to and they're amplifying cavities and through the projectors that are in the bottom of the crap.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       God, I wish I was smart enough to know whether he's full of Shit. Well, so what he's saying is that there's a gravity wave that's accessible on, on a really large element that extends beyond the perimeter of the atom. And when you bombard that, that element with one particle Kinda like what we were talking about before, it goes through a tube, like a very tiny miniature cern cern's like a big magnet holds a particle in a very specific

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       spot at hovers. It shoots and it hits that. It decays, it becomes this matter anti matter reaction, uh, these generators can convert all that energy into power and then they can amplify that wave that's coming off and emanating from that element. And they amplify it like you would amplify or a radio wave. Now there's no wires in the craft because most likely it was three d printed. We didn't know about three d printing back then. I've talked to Bob about this, but not just three d, three d printing, you know, just the materials. But atomically aligning the elements. So. So consciousness and other types of things can move through those materials to operate the craft. It's really good

Speaker 4:          00:54:07       operating it without buttons. Right. Operating it. So that was theoretically he said theoretically, right? Yeah. Was that there was handprints and that, you know, they were much different shaped hands and ours in this craft that he had found inside one of these bays and area 51, he realized very quickly that it wasn't something that we had created and that it was somehow another powered through intention. Yep. That would go through like touch or feel or or put their hands would be on this thing and consciously you would somehow or another control all the various aspects of this machine. Exactly, exactly. Alright. Sounds good. Doesn't it?

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       I believe so hard. Well, I hope you do because was going to be, there's going to be a lot of stuff. I want to know what you've seen though. So you've seen this piece of metal. What else have you seen? I've seen many, many documents on the studies of these things and I've seen a lot of the science associated with what the technology is and what it does. Like a, I could show you if I fold up pieces of paper and stuff, what's going on with it, but basically, uh, you know, these craft know when they travel in a straight line, but they're folding space type in event horizon where they explain it by folding a piece of paper and punching a pencil through it. You ever see that moment? Yeah, it's kind of like that movie, but it's more like, um, you know, here I can draw it for you here.

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       Not that this is a, it's Kinda like when you have two points, um, you know, we're used to traveling in a direction like that. And so when we look up, we see a plane that goes straight, right? But these, these Ufos fold space time like this, uh, and so it looks like to them they're going in a straight line. So if you're in the ship you see that. But if you're on the ground you see that. That's why you see them blink off and on. A lot of those videos they're on the, it looks like they're jumping. It's just because of this. So having space time,

Speaker 4:          00:56:09       some way of interfacing with space itself, that's very different than our idea of traveling in a linear way from point a to point b

Speaker 2:          00:56:16       space. The fabric, they call it the fabric of space time because it's like a fabric. It's malleable. Now, let me ask you this. How often into a conversation do people look at you and think you are fucking crazy when you started talking about this and how long was the time? All the time. Right? But do you ever get to the point where like, I don't want to talk about this because it's you. I always tell me, you don't know what I know and there's a lot. No, no. I mean like, do you ever get to the point where you're like, I can't do this anymore. Now people think I'm fucking crazy now because I'm involved on the most important shit I've ever been in my life. So I think this is like the most important thing that you've ever done. Fuck yeah. Like I, I have meetings with senators coming up, like, oh fuck yeah, senator.

Speaker 2:          00:56:54       So I can't tell you Dan was all this. I can't tell you stuff. I know this is some fucking Trenton. When is all this going to come out? Like it seems like this is like a animate eminent rather disclosure type shit. Watch what my company does. That's what I'll say. So what is your company? What are you, what are you trying to do? Well, we created. So if you look at the people involved, uh, we have senior high. When you get to the senior levels of government, you're either called an sts or six senior intelligence service, senior executive service, or you're a brass. But either way the civilians have the same kind of ranking charter that the breast is. So scs three, ss three, one three would be the same thing as a three star general. So I, that's, that's who these people are around me.

Speaker 2:          00:57:34       So I had the head of the skunkworks engineering. Um, I got, you know, a to star from the clandestine director, head of operations. I have a guy under secretary of intelligence for the Senate Intelligence Committee and was. These guys are retired that croissants. Retard calls are recorded. Well, they all, they all left. They are currently life. They now are involved the way you're doing, the way they are current consultants to the Internet, the intelligence community. Okay. That's probably the men involved in this project with clearance. They all have their top secret SSC. I clearances. Yeah. I'm the only one that does it on my entire team. I'm the only one that does it. Actually, Lou that just came out, I hired him away. So he was head of all, uh, he was in charge of all classified, uh, operations for secretary of Defense Mattis. So he was what's called a gs 15 right underneath the one, two and three stars.

Speaker 2:          00:58:33       He ran the advanced aerial fet program. And it's still continuing to this day and he's with us now. So the advanced aerial threat program under the United States government is essentially a Ufo. That's one of the minimization gathering assessment, assessment of all of the, of what those machines are doing that gives off all these types of effects that people are witnessing. But there's also a very large group of people that have had within government that I've had close contact like hundreds and it's connected to my group and there's just more coming in that way. So that program is trying to figure out what those technologies did to those people and how those technologies work. Even though it's

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       more saddle, it's more about tasking, you know, our assets like satellites and other things to be able to find these things better. But this is different than the secret machines book, which is more of another thing also. Is there communication between the United States government and alien lifeforms? I, I personally, I mean, I don't know any of this stuff, uh, because I'm not invited to those types of meetings. But I personally wouldn't doubt it. Yeah, you wouldn't doubt it, but they've never alluded to it or discussed it with you in any way. Not the, not this group of people know. Is there any speculation as to what they're doing? Resource extraction, resource extraction, like are like minerals, empire building. I tell people that. Are the eggs the. No, I think it's changed. I think it's Tacos think, well, you know, they're here for the same reason I am, but uh, um, I tell people like a good way to look at this is like, look at Syria and Syria is in chaos because the United States and Russia are having a proxy war there.

Speaker 1:          01:00:21       Now look at the earth. It's the exact same thing. Different races are coming here and uh, and they're trying to win. And one the universe we're talking about. I don't know how many, I don't know, but there's a bunch of different creatures and they all have the same sort of technology on summer. Very human. Some are looked just like you and I really. Absolutely. Yeah. No. Is there any sort of speculation as to why life forms from other planets, other galaxies of the solar systems, different kind of gravity, different environments would create a life form that's exactly similar to us or are they imitating what we look like in order to infiltrate our world and hang with us? I think probably all knowing. I think all the above. I mean, look, if you look at, if you look at Syria or are you just going to say it's only Russia and America, they're trying is probably there, Francis probably there, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       Um, I, I personally think the little, the little aliens with the big black eyes, those are androids, their biological robots. They're just programmed. There's no different than us cloning sheep. They just clone a being that can travel through space because space is sort of artificial intelligence thing that doesn't have a life form. Right. I heard that idea before and it Kinda kinda makes sense a little bit, right? I mean, if, if you're a living thing and you're traveling through space, obviously a biological limitations in terms of the need for oxygen and gravitational interactions and all these different things that one of the scariest hallmarks of those ones, the room or is it in the back of their head as a transmitter? So you gotta wonder where it's sending shit, but at the same time, you know, I can tell you that when you look at the Bible, uh, the angels and the demons of the Bible would be the humans and the androids that I just told you about. So you think the grades of the Androids, right? So you think there like some sort of devil? No, I just think that that's how we characterized it because they come in and control your thoughts. Control your body. Take is in the middle of the night. Yeah. Demons, you know. Um, so

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       do you think these things are traveling from where? Do we have any idea? There's things that have been put out there, but I've never asked. Why would you not ask them what the fuck? He didn't tell me. Star system like four, eight, three, and I'll be know about element 1:15. I would want to know about star ship enterprise coordinate 1:15, nine, six, five polaris. Wherever the fuck it is. Um, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I do know that there's, there's connections to um, you know, you won't even fucking believe it. I'll tell you that. You want to please Atlantis, Atlantis, the sunken city. Yeah. There's a connection. There's a connection. What the connection that there is a very advanced group that left after a catastrophe and hung around in a small outpost here and throughout time would push civilization forward and not to the Greek gods were.

Speaker 2:          01:03:09       Whoa. Yep. And that's why it's very interesting when the Roswell records, there's Greek writing is there, there is, I've never seen any of the records from Roswell view. It's online. You just type in Roswell records. You can see it. We're seen as the dude standing in front of the bullshit, the weather balloon stuff, or they'll laugh and yucking it up. Roswell wreckage, Roswell, IBM, you'll see it. And, uh, and it's got these Greek markings and the witnesses that were there did, um, did, uh, what do you call it? A where they go on a site on earth until, so that actual IBM showing the word l love Fieri, uh, which means freedom in ancient Greek. So ism from Jamie. Let me tell you why he want me to. I don't know if popped up when it, when. Well, I'm going to tell you something else.

Speaker 2:          01:03:57       So I went and met. I'm a former director of CIA and NSA. He was director of both. I want to tell you his name and right when I sat down and told them about my book, pull the picture up again, literally his little hands. And right when I sat down and told him about my, you gotta this is a big deal. I wouldn't have everything. So I'm sitting with this guy. He was like not that long ago. Was Director of CIA and he went on to be director of NSA. Okay. Well, I think we can find his name maybe, but uh, right when I sat down and told them about the book, you know what he says to me, what he goes, I didn't read much science fiction as a kid, but I read a lot about Greek mythology and looked me in the. I said, well, you're going to love the last page of my book then he's all man.

Speaker 2:          01:04:37       And uh, uh, when my book was about ready to go to pressing, I had a very important person call me up. He says, can you stop that pressing and maybe insert something about Greek mythology? And I said, I sure can. So once, something you got to realize is, for example, the sixth biggest defense contractor in the world, at least they used to be six. There's a company called Science Applications International Corporation, let's say. I see their headquarters are actually in San Diego and in the front of the building you have a, um, an oblique coming out of a fake lake and two, um, Atlantean on thrones and they're both holding pyramids and one says the past and the future. It's in there.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       Eight foot tall statues. It's fucking nuts by the way. An essay. I see. They just, they went over to Leidos. Michael Hayden, the former director of NSA and the CIA. What about it? No, that's not him, but I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna. Tell you if you try and find out what. Can you guys just fishing around? I'll say a name. You Blink. I'll show you my. No Pun intended. That was cute. I'll show you my dick. Like, no way. Yeah, here we go. If you, if you are not sure what. Yeah, whatever you get. I'm going to show you my dick. What do you think about all that Zechariah? Search and stuff? I think he was close. I don't think he was exact, but it's interpretive. You know, if I was to show you some symbols for people who don't know what that is exactly what I is, a is a Palestinian scholar that decoded a lot of ancient Sumerian texts that were written in Acadian.

Speaker 1:          01:06:07       I'm Samira was like kind of the first civilization that was advanced that we even know of just out of nowhere here, like 3,500 years before Christ. There's mathematics, astronomy and all this different shit. They knew all the planets. They said there was an extra planet, but Zacharias was the. Was the one that really spent a lot of time doing that. And there's, there's a lot of other scholars that disagree now he can say, you know, in those texts is the, is the story of the garden of Eden, the flood of Noah, like all that shit. But his take on it was those who from heaven to earth came called the main jewels, but they were an advanced race. They fucked around with genetics. Well that was the, his take on the definition of Nephilim was the. Was the nephew. Yeah. What you find them. You find that in genesis, the Nephilim.

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       So, you know, he, he was able to tell a really interesting story based on these texts and um, but some people don't agree with them, but at the, at the end of the day, I think it's the closest thing we got. And in my early conversations when I was, when I was being given some interesting science fiction stuff for my book, uh, the Greek mythology part, I brought up the Sumerians and they showed me one particular king. They said this, we find this one very interesting and I can't remember his name, but it fired so quick when I asked the question. It came right back with this whole thing on this one, Sumerian king. Really interesting. Well, what's fascinating about them is that they really did know a lot about our solar system. Can you think about the fact that they were around 5,000 years ago, they had a detailed model of the solar system with all of the planets and they were all relatively close in size.

Speaker 1:          01:07:44       This is a clay, one of those clay cylinders that you would. What you would do is you would put out a flat piece of clay and you would roll this cylinder over it and that's how they would print things. Yep. And this and this really sort of kind of primitive way of doing this. Somehow or another, they knew a lot about astronomy. I mean, they knew about the structure of our solar system. They knew where the planets were, right? Well, you gotta remember Galileo was almost killed and confined to his house house arrest because he said that the

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       universe doesn't revolve around us. We revolve around the sun and that was way after. That's for 5,000 years after the seminarians that already knew that, you know, we weren't the center of the universe. So it's interesting. We were really smart and then we went backwards. You know, and there's probably a bit more to that story too, that hopefully one day we'll get into it. Well, it's just, it's really interesting when you look at these ancient civilizations and their attempts to decipher the world around them and you try to figure out what did they know? You know, how much did they know that the Sumerians or one of the more interesting cases to me, because of the fact that they had this really bizarre map of the solar system when we didn't, they, they found out about Pluto. They had a, an image of Pluto and I don't think we found out about Pluto until like the early 19 hundreds.

Speaker 4:          01:09:06       Yeah. The Pluto might've even been like 15 or 16. You can find that out. Pluto was found like, like not even that long ago. I don't know if it was as far back as the night to see if you could find that out and then find the image of the Annunaki when they show the solar system. Because the image is really fascinating because it is what it is. I mean, you look at it, there's a son. I mean it's clearly a son. It has like a, it's a large circle. It's in the sky and it has those little son sort of raise around this picture, right? Because yeah. That's the picture. There you go. So do you know they, they have an idea of where to look for this extra planet. They thought in the early nineties, jpl announced that they thought they found a companion to our son.

Speaker 4:          01:09:48       He'll look at that. I mean that's fucking radical right there. Yeah, it's crazy. They have pluto in there now. Go to the discovery of Pluto when we went to Pluto, get discovered. I think you're right. I think it wasn't the 19 fifties. I know it was sometime in the 19th. I'm talking about Disney's Pluto, which means 30, 19, 30. Crazy. Crazy shit. Yeah. So these people somehow or another new about Pluto fuck in way before us. And this is not something you could see with the naked eye. So somehow or another and ignore where there's other planets. I mean you could see a few of them. You could see Mars and sometimes you could see Jupiter, maybe Saturn, right? Saturn. What are the ones you can see Saturn and after that they had uranus. You can't see. It's just the other one. Time have, I don't know, every 25 years you can barely see it with the naked eye we were in last week or something like that.

Speaker 4:          01:10:39       You were at Griffith Observatory. It was like super crowded because of that. Or we're not gonna we're not gonna. Make jokes and shit about your anus, right? No, because it's so old. Yeah. And were they looking at it with the naked eye or with telescope? I feel like you could observed because everyone goes there. There's a bunch of telescopes already set up, but that makes sense for telescopes. But why would the naked eye. It's one of the best places closest to la or I don't. Yeah, La is weird because of the light pollution right now. It's so it's a big deal. That's why, you know when you go to the desert and it's beautiful and I'm like Whoa, that's you releasing. It was last week, October

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       19th. You could see with your naked eye that urine, the secret to a unit. You guys are talking about naked in Uranus. A lot here and I don't want to make any jokes. I'm not, but I'm just telling you what you're talking about. See your anus with your naked eye this week. Giggle if you must. What a goofy name too. Like what? All the different sounds you can make with your face and they chose your buddle. What if they just call it buddle? Yeah. Butthole planet butthole. It'd be just as weird. Fucking crazy. Fast be the first place I go. That would be the first place you've visited the planet buddle? Yeah. Do you think that there's life in our solar system? I do. Where do you think it is? Europa? Really? So you think there's some sort of a primitive life form that's under the ice?

Speaker 1:          01:11:52       I think there's life on Mars and I think it's a little start from. I think there's life on Mars. I think it's small little animals in microbial or or insects shit that's kind of learning how to live with it's radioactive environment, which by the way, a bunch of scientists from jpl found that there was some atomic weapons that went off on Mars because the, the, the radioactive signature is can only happen if you explode a nuclear weapon. That's artificially made, not like a, like something that happens naturally, like a moon exploding on the surface. So it's interesting. So you read that. Oh Shit. That's been all over the place. I forgot the guy's name. The doctor's name. Um, he's a, he actually was one of the lead scientists on a clementine mission which was mapping the moon with jpl. So he's a, he's a big time dude.

Speaker 1:          01:12:44       And he thinks there was nuclear war. Huge. Well, he doesn't say that. He just says that nuclear weapons. He just says we have this signature. He all peer reviewed science that the signature of the radioactive activity from this very specific isotope that only comes from artificial nuclear explosion or something. Shit, I don't want to mess with something along those lines. Well, I'd heard before that they thought that somehow or another Mars was impacted that something hit it like some sort of Rasta oil impact and it destroyed the environment. I think it's the new, if you type in nuclear weapon Mars or nukes on Mars or some shit, you'll find it. You go to Richard Hoagland site, Hoagland. He kind of disappeared though. Yeah. That guy was wacky as fuck, like he, he was one of the WHO's the one of the main proponents of the face on Mars and all the pyramids that they found on Mars.

Speaker 1:          01:13:33       They would find these weird connections chain one point to another point and somehow or another they made some arbitrary distinctions that those were indicative of intelligent design. Elon musk wanted to drop nukes up there too. Good move. Elan Musk elaborates proposal to nuke. Maurice, how's that? Picture is not. He's probably bored. He put on his instagram last night. He was a cooking hot dogs and marshmallows and singing along with Johnny cash drinking whiskey. That's what he should be fucking scientist. Yeah. That's Elon Musk for president. I'll vote for you buddy. Come on. Let's do it. Why don't you talk to him and he's already got space x once you guys collaborated. The second thing we're doing, he might really actually be interested

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       in. And so the two aerospace projects to the stars is doing. One is we're building something that will in effect be anti gravity, but it's actually, that's actually not the mechanism it does. Uh, and building a spacecraft, but the second thing that we're doing is called beamed energy propulsion, which is something I think musk will be very interested in. It's launching cubesats with lasers. So, uh, the air force research lab kind of broke the science back in the nineties and a bunch of people associated with that program got it declassified and they're working for us on building it. So it'll take a handful of years to do. But what you do is you use very strong, either microwaves or some other kind of wave and it ignites and explodes the air underneath a mechanism that carries a cube set. And so essentially what happens is, is you don't use any fossil fuels and it can bring the cost of launching a cube sat from like 50 grand down to five grand. It's like crazy. So that means colleges and neighbors and anyone else can launch cube sats quite easily.

Speaker 4:          01:15:10       Now, have you had any debates with people about this stuff? If you ever like, had someone who thinks that this is all nonsense and sat down with you, understands physics and understands rocket propulsion space and elements. And all that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:15:23       Um, no I haven't. I wouldn't be able to debate a physicist, but they can read all the papers.

Speaker 4:          01:15:29       Right. But I mean, is anybody been skeptical? Zara. But yeah, everyone's skeptical. Yeah. And what's your response to that? You don't know what I know, right? Well, do you know though? I don't know. I can't tell you some of the shit that I know and I can't tell you, but what could it be that so crazy if you, you'd know. I mean, what you've said, we'll think about what you've said. You said that there's some ridiculous sorta propulsion system that allows you to move through time that they, they visit this planet all the time and extract resources that there's people in the government that are trying to disseminate this information, but they don't know how to do it. They don't have the right vehicle to do it. They're doing it in these sort of controlled chunks. Think of all these things that you've said. What could possibly be crazier than that? Well, you're asking me how do I know and. No, no, no, no. I'm asking you, what do you know that could possibly be crazier than that? Well, like that's the Shit I can't tell you. It's not. Everything's Hunky Dory. Is it something where you worried about the fate of the human race? I think that's part of it. Where should I move? I was going to move. It's not existential. If your dick out. If I should go to Australia.

Speaker 2:          01:16:35       How about, how about I just get down in Australia. I mean where's the spot? I don't think there is one unfortunately. Spot they just get this. This is what I will say. They're not existential in the sense of they're not gonna come here like independence day in nuke the place. Um, but it, there, you know, there are things to worry about and that's why I think

Speaker 4:          01:16:56       anybody that's famous, that's an alien. Oh, I don't know. Do you think there's any influential figure that has been sort of shaping culture that might not be one of us? Oprah, for sure. It has to be Oprah. Yeah. If you go back to the early days

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       when Oprah says, do that stupid show, we should have like KKK members on and everybody sat on white plastic seats. Remember those days or that Geraldo? Is that Oprah, Oprah, or early days? Man, me and Al Magical. I'll never forget this. It was like when I first met owl, probably like late nineties, I think we were in San Francisco doing bong hits, watching TV and oprah was on and it was old oprah, Oprah, oprah might not have been the nineties, might have been early 2000 of aliens from men in black. They were watching at the beginning, remember? Oh yeah. You know, I don't know. I mean I, uh, again, there's elements of this subject that are, that are disturbing and you know, I don't think people need to know all that shit. So do you subscribe to the idea that human beings are the product of genetic engineering? I do.

Speaker 1:          01:17:58       You do? So you think that they took some lower hominids and that they did something to them to create human beings? That is a very popular theory among Ufo fanatics. Or she'll say fans, [inaudible] I, I don't want to speak again for my company, but one of the people on our board, a scientific, they call it a scientific advisory board, is a lead geneticists from Stanford who I think he was up for the Nobel this year. And what's his name? Dr Gary Nolan. And he will be the Jeanette. He would be the guy to ask about that at him in here. But he, but he's, he's only going to tell you what's, what, what he can prove with science. He's not going to speculate, you know? So what, what makes people think that? Like what's the science that makes people think that? Well, there's a lot of junk DNA.

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       There's certain parts of our DNA that seems to have been turned off. There's, there's a, a bunch of things in there that we don't understand and we don't have the leaps of humanity over the past 5,000 years to really show like where did, what happened in the past 5,000 years that wasn't happening for the hundreds of millions of years before that. They just found a footprint that was, um, like 100 million years old or something like that. That was just a human footprint. What they did, I just read the news, I don't know. I can't remember, but it's like a fossil and now they're like, fuck, this totally throws everything upside down. And talking to Sarah Pailin, there was something to sell a pale and said, remember that like there was a librarian that said that she, she didn't believe that, uh, she was a young Earth creationist and she thought that, uh, there was a picture online that showed a human footprint inside of dinosaur footprint that approved the people walked dinosaurs.

Speaker 1:          01:19:34       I wouldn't doubt it. I doubt that people walked with diamond. Oh, not at all. I think there's been cycles of civilizations and I think the people on the inside know that. And that's why at that defense contractor, multi, multi, multi, multibillion dollar defense, the ones that chose the government of Iraq after we took over Iraq and the ones that looked over after all of our nukes, hey, look it there. They have print inside of dinosaur footprints. She's right. But they have, um, but they have at that place, remember I told you they have the past and the future with big pyramids in their hands, which regions, you know, that they're trying. It's like, it's a spooky

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       when you look at that and you believe that the asteroid hit the Yucatan and caused the mass extinction that killed off most of the life on the planet. I don't know. I can't believe in it. I don't know. Fuck, I've never studied that shit and I wasn't there. But I mean there's physical evidence for that. It's more like, well, yeah, but I haven't read anything about it. But sure. I can believe in things. I can't prove a lot of things, you know? Right. But that's like the whole reason why we're supposedly here that it killed off the dinosaurs and allowed whatever they think there was some sort of a mole, mole type creature that evolved over 65 million years ago was bullshit. I think it's all bullshit. I think you think evolution bullshit? Um, no. I think that at some point in history, uh, they came.

Speaker 4:          01:20:47       Someone came here and tampered with existing creatures and made us an upgraded us at very specific intervals who tampered with them and what came first, the chicken or the egg. You know what I'm saying? Question. Yeah. I don't know. A single celled organism. We all kind of agree like that was like the beginning, right? Most scientists, not we, I'm too stupid for this, but obviously somehow or another that became a bird, right? Why couldn't it become a monkey? Why could that monkey become a person? I think it, yeah. I don't know. I mean look at evolution changes. I mean we can, we know that people that like beat their kids, their kids DNA changes based on getting beat, you know? So when you were fighting, you were changing people's DNA and you're a geneticist, you know, you went after it for science, you know, that's why we were doing the fighting for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:21:33       It's a lab coat on. So if you, if you think about it that way, if you think about that all life somehow or another continues to evolve and advanced and through natural selection, genetic mutation and random mutations that things move from one stage of existence to what they are today. Right? That when you look at, you know, a con or a hippopotamus that it used to be something different and now it's that. Sure, why wouldn't that be the case that people too. I think that is the case with people. I just think that the quantum leaps in our evolution, our symptoms or effects of being genetically upgraded. The way I've heard it explained to me though, is that those, the only leap that's really confusing is the doubling of the human brain. You got a big leap and so over the period of 2 million years apparently, obviously I'm too stupid to really understand this, but from what I've read, what I've heard people talk about, that's apparently one of the biggest misses mysteries, uh, when it comes to the human fossil record. But there's a pretty clear line apparently from Australia, [inaudible] to, you know, to the homeless Judaism zig words on me. Trying to pivot is not a big word like it. What the fuck is that stuff again? Penis, anus, whatever. That's called. One 15, 1:15. That's death on that stuff. So what is your company aiming to do and when are you trying to do it? So the next steps. So to the Stars Academy of Arts and Science wise we have an academy because people. Yeah, there's, there's teaching, there's science, there's art major know there's film

Speaker 2:          01:23:05       franchises. So what this doesn't say musicals, know musicals, right? It's only musicals. Musicals. It's like everything is cool but not really stupid art forum. It's a, it's a musical, but it's very salacious. Very, very sexual musicals. But okay. So what we did essentially is you have a senior engineer, chief engineer from the classified aerospace world building shit. And then you have a guy like me that's putting out some stories and making some movies about some things. And then you have my physicists. Can I stop you there? I'm sorry to interrupt, but why stories and why fiction, like why not just going to be both. There's maybe both, but why fiction? Why not just concentrate entirely on revealing the truth because it has to be managed in a certain way for people to understand and I think that someone's sitting down and watching a debate play out and having an idea of what, what went on over the past 70 years.

Speaker 2:          01:24:02       They'll come out of that with an emotional response and more of an understanding and then want to go watch the documentary and then want to buy some of the nonfiction works that we've done. I've already put out, um, uh, one of our nonfiction books with secret machines. Now the, uh, that movie. What is it? Arrival. Yeah. I was at the movie where there's like sort of weird time shit in that movie. Does that movie have any basis in reality? No. Secret people behind the scenes? No, I don't think so. But, uh, there's nothing in there that's familiar to me other than the fact that the dream sequences and the time stuff and her having flashes of that shit's absolutely on par. And, um, the idea of having a, an international group work together and figure something out that's absolutely on what's happening right now. And everybody's keeping their mouth shut.

Speaker 2:          01:24:49       Oh fuck you. Why are they doing that? Why aren't people spilling the beans? Um, well, it's not every. I mean, look at Lou Elizondo, the guy that works for me, they just came from the Pentagon, literally quit the Pentagon two weeks ago. I was the, I can't tell you where I'm at, but I know I'm sorry. But, um, but, uh, he's with me and he, he was onstage with me on the live event we did on the 11 saying I left the Pentagon days ago. I ran this particular Ufo program and this is what we know and they are real and we're gonna continue that program here at to the stars. Now what's your. So your goal is to release this information through documentaries, through films, and educate people, but the existence of this and is it to make a ship? What? No. So we're bringing. So this is once again, look there by putting together.

Speaker 2:          01:25:37       You can't attack this subject by just like if you make a movie that's a crazy movie. If you make a science paper on it and then no one's going to read it and the technology will never see the light of day because it's been modified as weaponry or whatever it is that the only way to get people to understand what the fuck is going on is by first present them the story so they have an understanding that it is real and it happening and laid in a way that's grounded and practical and uh, but still moves you and then follow up with the science and then show them that that thing you're watching in the movie can be engineered and created. So we're doing it all together. But there's a thing called a community of interest. So to the stars is also building a portal with the Department of Defense to share information, to educate people, to put some declassified now declassified videos of Ufo shows, some science, some documents, and have open forums, uh, and have current military people talk to young adults.

Speaker 2:          01:26:39       So you're gonna expose people to this narrative and uh, explained to them through stories what this could be that sets the stage. Then you start to introduce the actual real elements that actually exist yet. And then eventually what, what's the end game will the end game is to. The technology itself is like. So when, when you make a, when you, when you create this energy source to power the spacecraft, it's called an over unity machine. So it puts out more power than what's put into it. You can desalinate ocean water with it, you can get rid of a atomic power. So there's no radio, no more Fukushima xeno. It could do a lot of different things, but it also will rapidly, rapidly transform our entire transportation and communication network. So the end result with that is it, that'll get spun out into a accompany. That's probably partners with major aerospace organizations, which with whom I'm already talking and we partner on the madness.

Speaker 2:          01:27:41       You can't tell me who they are, no, fuck now I can't tell you and we bring that out to the world, but the only way that can be brought out to the world as if the public owns it and we build it from scratch. The public was the public have to own it because, well I guess you could be in a way a private person, but the technology, it probably has an element of what they call eminent domain. So we're going to get to a certain point where certain agencies will probably knock on our door and go, what the fuck are you doing? And we're going to say the public owns this. You can't take it from. And they're gonna say fuck yeah, we can take it and we're going to say we're going to work something out because it's like building a nuclear bomb in your basement kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          01:28:16       So, so when you say the public owns it, like how will that be possible? How would the, how will the public own it? The you can go to our, we've, we reserved a small amount of shares of the company that people can buy stock in the company right now. So a year ago, the success, not the public. That's private, that's private ownership, right? If people buy the company can go public, but no it didn't. No, it is public. So a year and a half ago, maybe 24 months ago, the sec wanted to democratize, um, uh, going public with companies just like an IPO but not have to spend millions of dollars and do it. So they launched what's called a regulation, a direct public offering. And we had a file with the SEC. So we had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to do this and we spent the last six months doing it and our live event

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       launch that. So you can go to tennis. Did this just so that you can tell the whoever the fuck it is that will come after you, that hey, the public owns this. You can't take that. That's one element of everything that we're doing. Yeah. That. So you're anticipate you're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to anticipate someone coming in and closing the doors and they yet you're talking about it in advance. We're like, you're essentially telling, strategizing that you know, but you're letting them know that you know, that they're going to come and get it. It'd be much harder to shut it down when the whole world has paid for it, invested in it, owns it. And uh, so he trying to get people to buy things. I'm trying. What do you mean you tried to get people to buy stock? Well, yeah. Right now we're a public.

Speaker 1:          01:29:42       You can buy shares of the company. You can only. We only put up. I'm a very limited amount that we only put it. I think we only put up $5 million shares or so. That seems like a lot of shares. How many shares are they're all others. Oh Lord is like a 100 million probably or something like 100. How does that, how does shares work? Shares late. You just don't work. Like say if we, uh, came up with young Jamie incorporated. Yeah. And we wanted to start selling shares. When you file as a corporation, you can issue shares and you can sell those shares to people in those shares. Have a price based on, you know, how you want to value your company, you know. Okay. So you could have like 100 million shares of young Jamie Incorporated. Yep. You sure can. Okay. And so then the government can shut you down, Bro.

Speaker 1:          01:30:21       Nah. Well you guys may be because you say a lot of bad words. No, no, no. Jamie doesn't. But I'm warming. We do a lot at the company. Right? So we're building essentially a science fiction version of Disney. Okay. So we have four film franchises. Not all of them, about Ufos. One is kind of this blade runner night, all about nightmares kind of thing. One is like an old amblin. Spielberg goes and making these things a. We are. Let me know who's writing them. I wrote the first one. I'm directing that a good directing too. I wrote this script and you're multi talented motherfucker. Look I'm, that's where I'm going with most of this stuff. But the company I had to get up and get going and set it up and we bring in a ceo and all that kind of shit. It's a bizarre formula, right?

Speaker 1:          01:31:03       An entertainment company that's also gonna do aerospace and science will. The heart of it is when we do what's called confirmation, not disclosure confirmation. A the heart of it is is how do we tell stories that galvanized the human race and let them know a little bit more about what's going on and how do we present them science so they understand the consciousness and a lot of other things are real. And how do we build a technology associated with those stories and with dos science that can change the world. And that's why it's an academy. So they have any pickled bodies anywhere. I go from Ohio. I believe they do believe they do. Nobody's ever told you that I believe to get. I believe they do. You believe they do? You can't say anymore than. I'm not gonna say anymore than that said so much what you can and can't say. Well, I can tell you other shit offline. Probably offline. I can't wait to end this podcast. Fucking kick me out. I tell anybody please. Some weird shit. Um, so now what, what's

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       the timeline for moving forward with all this stuff? Okay. So in the next few weeks we're going to be releasing the first declassified videos of these advanced aerial threat Ufos, um, and they are current videos that were just caught and with audio and everything of the people tracking and uh, and we're going to launch the Beta version of the community of interest, which is the partnered website that's going to be hosting all this declassified information where we're gonna be having the hardcore. I'm a conversations with people that want to understand this stuff. We're going to be also doing an experiment with that piece of metal to show the world that the technology is not only real, but it's, it's demonstrated and the videos are very much a proof of concept, you know, it was showing you look at works, you know, so we're going to build it. And um, do you think it's gonna be weird for people to take you seriously because you're a rockstar like me.

Speaker 2:          01:32:49       If you were like some sort of a physicist scientist that would listen to you more. Well, you know, I remember when Ellen came out years ago and he started space x and then he started test that. My, here's this dude saying all this ambitious shit. I didn't buy any of it. I think guys a 100 times smarter than the both of us combined. The he's fucking gnarly. I know, but I'm just saying he caught believable once a year maybe. And maybe I think he is. I mean, shit, he's bad ass. But look at the people. You know what's interesting to me is you haven't seen who are with. Have you looked at the bios on the shit? No. Yeah, you got to read the Bios of the people. I didn't want to be tainted. I wanted to talk to one of the, on my, on my sat. The Scientific Board Advisory Board is, you know, one of the guys that CIA that headed up the entire biowarfare program and the director of operations, the client desk nine divisions.

Speaker 2:          01:33:36       All these guys have found us how various ways. So they've come to you because they like the beacon. I did something as this is the way to go. I did something that no one thought was possible. What's that? Was tying together a mechanism that can perpetually fund itself and can communicate and can innovate all with people that sit at the seat. I created a round table with engineers, scientists until high ranking intelligence officials and uh, and some others I can't tell you about it, obviously in the, in the defense world, it's called stove piping. So when they, when they compartmentalize a secret, they put them into these vertical categories that can't talk to each other. I created a horizontal structure where all these people in these amazing accomplished positions in government were able to come together at the same table and they can discuss what we want to teach the world and how we want to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:34:39       And, but the but the way to do that is including the public and making it a public benefit corporation. And what that means is we're able to spend money and it's in our charter on things that can benefit the world and not just provide a return to the investors, but what we're doing happens to be extremely lucrative, lucrative, my, my engine, lucrative for investors or insure investors and the company. So it was it like saved young. Jamie wants to be a part of it. What does, what does he have to do? You just go to the Stars Academy Dot Com and you buy shares whatever you want to buy. And I will be lucrative for him because the first of all the technology, it sounds like a trillion dollar thing. If we can figure that out over the next eight years and they think we can. So they.

Speaker 2:          01:35:19       Who's they? The, the engineers that are building this thing. The guy. So Steve Justice that was head of advanced programs at the skunk works. We talked about that. They build all of our. They are the tip of the spear for the most advanced spacecraft and aircraft that the United States national security apparatus has period, period. Hands down. And he was the big boy there and their model, we think we have a s, you know, this is a, this is a guest, but I think there's a 60 percent chance within 36 months or so, we'll be able to demonstrate something pretty kick ass and as long as there's no major obstacle there, we think within eight years we'll be able to have something but it's expensive and we've got to work with the government and we're going to have to work with major aerospace. For example, this one meeting I have coming up with, with a big name aerospace company, is offering their material sciences division.

Speaker 2:          01:36:11       We need that. We need to be able to create certain metals that can resonate and circle certain frequencies, shit like that. The other way that the company makes money is when we build this, the satellite launching system. That's like exactly what [inaudible] doing now putting satellites in orbit, but we don't have to build rockets. We can launch them with lasers. That's a big deal. You point lasers at the bottom of a cube sat, which is like the size of a shoe box, and you can put it into low earth orbit and you can put it up even higher without using any fossil fuels with using light. That's a big deal. That's a multibillion dollar gimmick right there. It's just been proven. I told you, seeing the proof. There's this video of this accident. It's in our launch video. If you watch the video at the top of the to the Stars Academy Dot Com page, you'll see shots of it.

Speaker 2:          01:36:55       We're a little thing's glowing and is getting beamed up into the sky. That's the air force. Yeah. My guys were on that project. Little thing's glowing or. Yeah, like a mass though. Like a satellite? Yeah. Yeah. They're called cube to cube. Sat is a cube. Sat is a modular box that you put together as modules based on what you need. Okay. I need to thrust her. I need a sensor and I need a fucking rf signal thing to send the data back home. So now you've got three little boxes attached. That's a cube set. They call them cubes, so it's essentially, um, it, it's probably 80 percent of the satellite business, but now they got to put all these cube sats together on Musk's rocket that's also launching giant satellites for dod or whatever, but it's super expensive because you have a rocket and you have all that fossil fuels and all this stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:37:44       If he launched these cube sats with lasers because they're not that heavy and you can, like I said, it would take a cost of launching a cube, sat from 50 grand a pound down to five grand. That's huge. So there's the video of this actually happening. That's on your, what is the, to the Stars Academy Dot Com is. And you can watch the, you can watch the video and then you go to the entertainment division, which is my primary spot. Um, you know, making movies and selling millions of books and licensing this stuff out is the diff, is the reason why Disney's $300 billion in warner brothers is 5 billion warner brothers just makes movies. Disease makes they make franchises and they're vertically integrated. We put up the book, we put out the t shirts, we make the movie. So that's really where we're going. And we have, um, we have three television series that are probably one of which will be announced probably in the next couple of weeks.

Speaker 2:          01:38:36       The other two were a little further out on that. The first film, uh, our first film is first quarter of next year. I wrote that one and I'll be directing. That one's called strange times, which is like a hard, our version of the goonies but funny but scary and fucked up. But with 17 and 18 year old kids, um, and then, uh, and then secret machines, the motion picture, that's, these are all franchises. So strange times has an animated series that's coming out. We have wonderful writer from. Sorry, I live, that's show running the thing. We have an unscripted show coming out on the entire company just following us in a very national geographic way as we do all these things. And as we build lasers, as we're on the movie sets, as we're in the lab, you know, pinging that, those, uh, those pieces of metal I told you about.

Speaker 2:          01:39:22       So, uh, there's a lot of things like that going, um, so when you ask about how do we monetize all this shit, we have a full functioning entertainment division has been up for a few years. That's what I've been doing. And that's how I made the book. And we've put out seven novels already. Your end goal is ultimately to expose all of this information. My American, my end goal is not just that my end goal is to build a company that changes the world and by doing a traditional IPO in the next five to seven years. And to do that, I grabbed very, very high ranking people from various areas in the government to achieve all this stuff. And they, they don't need to come in on the movies. I have that on lock. That's my thing. But it can, it can function as a way to help people understand what the fuck is going on.

Speaker 2:          01:40:10       So some of the movies, some of the TV series, some of the nonfiction works that we do will all be about that subject, but the rest of it won't be all right dude. Well that's a very ambitious project and let us know when you're ready to go to the moon or Mars or wherever the fuck you're going to go. Yeah, you can go to your anus all those places. And uh, I hope it's all real. I'm excited. Cool. Thanks drew. Thanks for having me. Oh, thanks for coming on rather than. Yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye. Everybody.
