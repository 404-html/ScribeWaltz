Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Four, three, two, one.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Hello Barry. Hi. And that we're live. Thanks for doing this. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. It's a very fortuitous your timing comes right in the middle of this big hubbub about this native American elder in this young boy with one of those stupid fucking red hats on that. Would you have ever imagined that a slogan make America great again? Would be so divisive as somehow or another like that. That would be like make America great again. It sounds like they just want to make things great. Like all positive. No red hat with white letters. Has there ever been a time like that where an object like a red hat with white letters was so repulsive to half the country?

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       Yes. Well, I mean some people see it as the equivalent of a white hood.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       Wow. I don't know about that. I think, I believe.

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       Do they do what they believe that wearing it, wearing it that a 16 year old wearing that hat sort of carries intense moral weight that surely we know that a 16 year old is not aware of all the implications of wearing that hat. Yeah, but the problem with that is Kanye wears it, right? Fair enough. It doesn't really work. I agree. I'm just saying there are people who really make that argument. I get it. I know the people who are paid for their opinions.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       Well, yeah. Well, there's also people that are calling for this child's name and address or calling to docs him and publicly expose him. This is a child. He's 16. Is that what he is?

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       He's 16 years old and it was one of the things that was just so amazing about the whole brouhaha around. I mean it was even a way like this perfect encapsulation of our outrage culture. Right, because people saw a tiny clip of this video and it was like a Rorschach test you saw in it this morality play of what would it look to be, was a group of mostly white kids from Coventry Catholic school. I think it's in Kentucky and it looked like at first glance that they were smirking and smug and had these sort of shifting and grins on their faces and that they were surrounding this older native American man and I have to tell you, I had a visceral reaction to it. The second I saw it, like so many other people. I was like, this is, you know, where we are in our broken culture and they're bullying this guy and here's the rise of the.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       I had all of those reactions. The challenge of what it means to be a journalist is to not see people as signifiers or as stand ins just based on their identity. And that's what like 94, 95 percent of the press corps did. They sort of leapt to the leap to assume that, you know, are visceral reaction was accurate when in fact when you actually looked at like the two hour video of the whole interaction, which also included this group of black Israel lights or Hebrew Israelites, they called. It was not that at all. The native American man had walked up to this group, the four other guys had been heckling the group beforehand, calling them crackers, calling them Satan, calling the one black kid in the group, things that can't even be said. So it was just far more complicated. Um, and what, what was really, really disheartening is that the initial outrage was enough for the mainstream press to report on it. Like twitter has kind of become almost an assigning editor for places like the New York Times and the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. And then when the actual truth of the thing comes out, when we move past the outrage cycle, they have to sort of write the followup story to the fake outrage to begin with.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       I'm defending the fake outrage instead of backing up and saying we made a mistake.

Speaker 2:          00:03:51       Right. Well, some people said that they made a mistake. That's wonderful. That's a good sign. Yes, it really is. One of the things that was so horrifying was that people that are supposed to be adults, you know, people with blue check marks on twitter were saying things like, this is the face of white patriarchy. The 16 year old kid raise the US on set. Have you ever seen him more punchable face? Kathy Griffin was saying, I need names. Shame him. Docs him. How do these people not understand the implications of that? So what happened over the weekend was that the, you know, sleuthy detectives on twitter found a kid who they thought was the kid in the video, wasn't actually the kid. So there's the actual kid who was docs. The family was harassed. Everything that we now know happens in these outreach cycles. But then there was another kid who looks suspiciously like him who was not him at all, whose family.

Speaker 2:          00:04:47       There was an amazing and heartbreaking twitter thread about it, whose family was in the middle of a family wedding and they spend their whole weekend fighting off these mobs who were trying to destroy them. And it wasn't even the kid in the video. I mean, that is really horrifying to me that that's where we are and the fact that adults who should know better or fomenting this and don't see how thin like the v s sounds heavy, but like the veneer of civilization is like they're taking a pickax to it. It's just. I just found the whole thing to be terrifying. I don't know how you felt

Speaker 1:          00:05:26       exactly the same way and I think it's a very unique moment because it's so public and it's so. It's so prevalent in whether it's twitter or facebook, it's everywhere and it sort of embodies everything that's wrong with a lack of nuance and with people taking one side versus the other and sticking with it with not confronting their own personal biases with looking at these things through the eyes of this is the enemy. I'm on the good side. They're on the bad side. Let's get them. And also this, this distorted idea of what it takes to what it takes to be violent. Like this idea of this is a punchable person like calling for violence. You, you're, you're hearing a lot of this. Like, this is one of the things that troubles me so much about the left. My family, my parents were hippies. You know, I grew up when I was a little kid.

Speaker 1:          00:06:25       We lived from age of seven to 11 and San Francisco during the Vietnam War. While the Vietnam War was ending, I was living in the middle of the hippie world. I always felt that people on the left, we're like these well read kind, compassionate people, but somewhere along the line, within the last few years, people on the left are calling for violence. This is very. This is very confusing to me, and it's. It's this frivolous social media call for violence. It's not an in person, be their boots on the ground call for it. It's a very strange call for Violence Punch Nazis. I'm hearing this all the time because it's right, because it's. Sorry, go ahead. What I'm going to say is what does a Nazi okay? If you mean punch actual Nazis that are putting Jews in the concentration camps. I'm with you, but when you call a guy with a Maga hat on, he wears one of those red hats and he's just an asshole. He's a Nazi. Now, some guy who maybe is not that educated want to be a contrarian, sees all these liberals that are complaining all the time so it puts this red hat on and now he's a white supremacist and a Nazi and you want to punch him like, okay,

Speaker 2:          00:07:34       that's with a lot of people in very high positions of power in this country, at least in the culture actually believe and they don't understand the implications of hollowing out words like that. I know this personally, right? Because I'm called alt right. I'm called an apologist for rape culture. I've been called everything. I'm a centrist. Okay. I'm. I'm a Jewish center left on most things. Person who lives on the upper west side of Manhattan and you know it's super socially liberal, liberal on pretty much any issue you want to choose. If I'm alt right, what? What words do we have left for people that actually are that? Exactly what words do we have left for people who actually are part of a sort of racist blood and soil nativism that's rising in this country and around the world that should terrify people that are using that language in the sloppiest of ways. I really don't think they're seeing the implications of it. I also think that when, when you're just, you know, your keyboard warrior and you're just tossing this stuff out, so much of it is about signaling to your tribe that you know, that this thing is bad and I really don't think people are understanding the implications of this and I don't think it's a stretch to imagine something like this happening a week, two weeks, a month, two months from now and someone actually getting killed.

Speaker 1:          00:08:59       Right? Like Charlottesville mean. Very, very similar to what happened there. This, this, this kind of. I mean when that guy drove over those protesters, the ramping up of the dialogue on both sides, the rhetoric, the violent talk, it's so disturbing and so unnecessary. Especially when it's disingenuous. Like calling someone like you alright or me cry. I get called alt right adjacent. That's what I hear, that one all the time. I'd go left on everything basically except guns. There's a few things that I'm like repeal the second amendment. Yeah. But I, I do think that there should be some restrictions for gun use. Just like I think there should be restrictions for car use. I actually think there should be testing for guns and you should have to go look. You have to go through a fucking. You have to take driver's Ed to get a car license. How come you don't have to do any, you know, you don't have to do anything to get a gun like you once. If you're not a criminal, you just get a gun. Like you don't have to know how to take care of it and clean it and sit safely. Handle it. You don't have to know the ethics of use. You don't have to know anything.

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       No. It's insane. I mean, and I just spent six weeks in Australia where they had basically one major massacre 20 years ago and then I forget who it was. We could look it up, but you know, prime minister conservative got rid of guns. Yes. Everyone in the country, they think we're insane and psychotic the way that we live where we're definitely weird. The thing also, one other thing that, that jumped out to me about the Catholic school boy incident, it kind of signifies something broader that's happening, which is the eraser of the individual, which is just, I think a horrifying problem in our culture. Like what actually happened was one our incident on a random afternoon in January between a group of individuals. Right. But instead in our mind, why was everyone there? The boys were there for the march for life. Um, I don't know why the Hebrew Israelites were there, but it's DC, like they're crazy protesters all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:11:01       You know, at the Lincoln memorial and outside of the White House were there for a school event? Is that what we're there for the march for life as part of their school and they had like, been had free time I think. And then we're converging at the Lincoln Memorial. They didn't have a chaperone. There's no, no. I think the teachers, there was a teacher there and they had asked the teacher at one point in order to drown out the heckling of the Hebrew Israelites, I hope I'm getting the name of that group right. Could we do a school cheer to kind of ignore them? And they did that and I think they did that with permission from the teachers at one point early on it was rumored that they were chanting build the wall, but no one has surfaced any evidence of that whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       Well, that's what I heard from the native American elder when he was talking about innovation in the video. He said they were chanting out build

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       and maybe they were. I just haven't seen anything and I've watched every video.

Speaker 1:          00:11:49       It's totally possible there also 16. Right. Make your friends

Speaker 3:          00:11:54       laugh and they're assholes and they're just being silly and stupid. Right. And I have to say, as someone who was a total nerd in high school, I saw the face of the main kid in that still photograph and that video and like the 14 and 15 year old girl in me with like enraged, really like I was like I see the face of so many kids who said the nastiest things to me and who through friends of mine into garbage cans, like the, like disgusting bullying. Was it because the thing is you have to get to the next step if you're a jerk. No, we was. It was. Yeah. Oh, for sure. If he's just standing there, it's the hat face. Maybe even still if it's a group, but he put the. My thing is like your initial reaction to something is not the truth.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       It's your emotional reaction. And anyone who calls themselves a journalist like your job is to figure out the facts of the case. Not to make this into a kind of identitarian morality play. And the fact that so many people in so many publications did just that. And in fact, when the real facts surfaced, just sort of dug their heels in and were basically like, well, he's a stand in for the white patriarchy. What? That's crazy. That's crazy. Like there was an actual buzzfeed writer that said it. It's the look of white patriarchy, his face. You're really going to put that on a 16 year old, would we? Like, it's just nuts to me. Well, it's cruel. It's a denial of the individual. It's very cruel. When you're 16 years old, you're basically a baby. You don't know what the fuck you're doing. You're incredibly susceptible to the influence of your peers.

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       You're around a bunch of other boys. You're not around girls cause you don't go to school with girls because he goes some wacky religious school, right? That this is, you know, you want to really be a social justice warrior. You really want to save the world. How about you do something about the Catholic Church? Everyone wants to go after our Kelly, which is great. But how about the Catholic Church? How about the number one kid fucking organization of all times? That's what it is. And I, I was raised Catholic, I know what it is. Did anything happen? And nothing happened to me. I got lucky, but I know people. I know a bunch of people. I know a bunch of people with stories and this is all over the world. Oh yeah, but these kids come from that Colt. Imagine if that was not the Catholic church.

Speaker 3:          00:14:16       If it was insead, scientology, we will be going, oh, these kids are a part of a cult. They went there. They were part of this weird cult that suppresses sexuality amongst its priests and encourages the placement of these pedophile priests in new places in order to get away from whatever crime they've committed in the area where they were initially established. This is what the Catholic church is, right? But then they travel all over the place, but it also is good people. This is the. This is where the nuance comes into play. It's good people. There's a bunch of people that are Catholics because they want a better with God or the universe or love or whatever. They feel like it's a good moral framework for their children. They take them there, they believe in the 10 commandments, they believe in this moral structure for society that's laid down by what they believe is God.

Speaker 3:          00:15:05       There's great people that are involved in the Catholic church, but it's also the number one kid fucking organization the world. It's those two things, right? So these kids are a part of something that's way worse than smirking at a native American with a drum. And in my opinion, being A. I remember when I was 16, I was a fool. I was a dumb person, you know, I was bullied, I was little, small and I learned martial arts when I was 15. I mean, I'm sure it was a dick to some people just because I can get away with it. I don't, I don't really remember it, but I'm definitely girls differently. People are dicks. You're trying it out, you know, you don't even know how to talk yet. You basically just learning words and this kid with this guy beating the drum inches from his face.

Speaker 3:          00:15:52       He handled it, I believe way better than I was. I don't think I would have. I don't see. I mean, I don't think so. No, I don't think so. No one knows. 16 pop punk. When I was 16 to also I was competing. I was doing a lot of martial arts events, so maybe I would've kept it together better than I'm. I'm thinking I would have, but I definitely was a fucking idiot and I was 16. You know, you just don't. And who knows what's going on that day, who knows? Like if you have the anxiety about the future of your girlfriend broke up with you or you failed the test or what else that is like bouncing around inside your head. Overwhelming your ability to form reasonable thoughts by the way that everyone's initial. Not everyone's every liberal. I know. Okay. Everyone on the center and center left and even the center reits reaction to it was accurate that he was a little asshole and he's a racist, homophobic, transphobic hates immigrants in every single thing.

Speaker 3:          00:16:52       Does that deserve to be news that a 16 year old kid with those views smirked at a native American elder? Especially considering what he actually did? No, I don't think that's news. Not only that, I think it's strange that we're covering it like it is and because of the Internet, the fact that we're my timeline on twitter and on facebook and on everything. This was way bigger news than day, whatever it is, 30, 31 of the government shutdown where people are having to get on breadlines to feed their families. Then here's the thing, is it like it's people what it's what people want to talk about. I think there's this idea that there's things that are happening right now like the government shutdown and then there's things that are happening right now in terms of our culture shifting and when these things that come up in opposition to what many people believe is a beneficial shift to a more progressive, more responsible culture.

Speaker 3:          00:17:51       When these little hiccups, they get addressed and they get address rapidly and I think it's because people are aware that things are changing in this almost like unprecedented way. If you look back on pace. I agree with that. Yeah, like nothing we've ever. There's nothing that you could find in the historical record for human beings is ever been what we've experienced over just the past 10 plus years of social social networks and social media and the ability to spread information very quickly with a youtube video or a tweet or whatever, or I mean these, these, the way people are exchanging information is, is very different and because of that culture is shifting at a hyperspace speed. It's just turbo charged for sure. So I think when something comes up that we think is like, ah, there's one get it. Exactly. But it's not logical. It's like it's like road rage.

Speaker 3:          00:18:47       You know why you get road rage? One of the reasons because you're going fast. Okay, you're in a car and you're nervous. You're, you're heightened senses. So anything that happens, it gets magnified. Like someone's, you look motherfucker in my lane, Hong Kong because you already jacked up to eight because you're in a car going 60 miles an hour on twitter. Does that. Twitter's doing that 100 percent. Social media is doing that. Life is doing that. So when something like this comes up, this rapid pace of change, which is almost an impossible to keep up with, right? With the new cycle and this constant wave of change and information. So when something comes up, people were road raging on this kid. Totally. That's why we just have to. I mean there's, there's lots of things to say, but one thing has just continued to insist on truth and facts.

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       Yes. And not allowing people to be ins for a group. You're not a stand in for anyone. You're yourself. You answered for yourself. And I just, I find that trend on both sides really, really scary. It's because people are insecure and you know, I think for someone like Cathy who's experienced, Kathy Griffin, who's experienced that public shaming, that amazes me, right? Like she's been publicly shamed herself in the most horrific way. Has he basically had to live underground and now she's saying shame him, name him and docs. It reinforces, it reinforces people's idea that they should be more, more committed to their side, more committed to their team. The only way you're going to get any support if you have been attacked and isolated, not alone, is to get back deep, deep into the team again. Like how do you get back deep into the team again?

Speaker 3:          00:20:24       You've got to be fucking rabid, you know, and that's part of it. It's a, it's a natural reaction that people have to sort of signal to everyone else on the team. They're all in, they're fully committed. They don't even care about their fucking career. I'm an activist like that kind of shit happens and it's, it's people that want love. That's what a lot of it is. It's they. They do recognize that there's something wrong they'd, they are reacting to a real thing. Not denying that, but I am saying that the reason, the overwhelming reason, the motivation for this kind of overzealous reaction is often a signaling thing. So they want to let everybody know I'm on the fucking team, man. I'm all in. Let's go punch Nazis. And the people that I've talked to, people that have said that and in real life, and I'm like, man, you, you can't punch any, but you shouldn't punch anybody.

Speaker 3:          00:21:11       They're going to punch you back. What do you don't punch first of all? Who's your savior? Punch for a real, real, real one, you know, in Poland or in Hungary right now, right? Right. Know, not at, not a 16 year old kid who maybe has no idea what that had signifies. Well, I mean, and I mean there's a broader point which is like the very same people, like one of the sort of wisdoms of, of criminal justice reform, right, is which I believe in, is that we shouldn't try kids as adults and we should forgive. We should have greater generosity and mercy and forgiveness for the crimes of a child. Even if they're, they've committed them. Those same people are the ones saying him and shame him generally. Politically. Well, you're seeing that now. And this is again, there's never been a doxing before. There was no doxing.

Speaker 3:          00:22:05       Right? How long has [inaudible] been around? A decade. Well, thank you. Since Game Gamergate is when it got huge, right? Yeah. Maybe let's go crazy and say the first doxing was 20 years ago. That's a blip, right? That's so recent. So you know, this is not a thing that people have really had to balance out in their mind when to do it and when not to do it, they just do it. I think people have no idea of what that looks like. Right? And unless you've experienced it or watch someone, you know, experience it, it's like it's like an abstraction because these people are abstractions. They're two dimensional little puppets. That's exactly what it is. That's exactly what it is. And this extreme lack of empathy. The lack of empathy towards anyone who doesn't share your position. This is very strange. It's um, it's very, it's piss poor thinking and it's everywhere and in.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       Everyone wants to feel like not being a part of one of the tribes is that extremely lonely position and you get called all the bad names because people want you to be a part of their tribe and people don't want to be called that name is. And they want to feel like they're in an ingroup huddle, like emotionally. I totally got that kind of sucks being homeless. Well, it's just politically homeless. It's just when you got a president that's so polarizing and you have an opposition to him that's so there, there, there's so much momentum in opposing him. And I think this is a giant wedge in between these two sides. And then you have that hat and that hat. If that kid wasn't wearing that hat a guaranteed be like 20 percent less hate, it would be. It would be great. People would still get mad at him because he was staying like.

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       I've seen people say when a native elder walks up to you and he's banging his drums, get the fuck out of the way. I saw that. Like, come on, you can't expect that you what? You can't just beat your drum. First of all, he got right in the kids face like inches from the kid's face. Pretty amazing. The restraint this kid had to just smile. And the idea that you're going to judge this kid. Millions and millions and millions of people are going over this right now. That kid woke up that morning, he had no fucking idea. He was a kid in a cult. Okay? He's in a Catholic school and he's going to some weird thing, some march for life where people trying to kill babies. We've got to stop them from killing babies, right? And he goes there and there's this black Israelites calling them the faggots and there's all these people calling them names and then all of a sudden this guy's beating the drum in front of his face and we're supposed to.

Speaker 3:          00:24:36       We're supposed to dock this kid now because he smirked. That's crazy. An impossible lack of empathy. It's impossible to defend like unless you hate boys, unless you hate all boys because boys are dumb. Like 16 year old boys are almost universally dumb. They all, they all grow up to be men. Some of those men will be your best friend, so when those men will be amazing, some of those men would be so happy to see. When you see him, you give him a big hug. Okay, that's me. That's me. I was a stupid fucking 16 year old and I'm a man now and I try to be as nice as I can to everybody. I go way out of my way to be a kind person that could be that kid to like what you're doing is not good for anybody. It's not. It's not good for society to take this trend and run with it and this is, well, this is what people do now you know, you dock 16 year olds turbo charges the right, like think people are not quite understanding that dynamic.

Speaker 3:          00:25:33       If you're someone who you know is frustrated with trump and is maybe moving to the middle and you know, imagine that person, it's easy to imagine. Then you see this and you're like, I don't let those people being in charge of me. I don't want those people running the government. That's the visceral reaction. I just, I don't think they're understanding the implications of what they're doing. I don't think they understand that they do. Maybe they didn't know. There's no mastermind behind this. There's and there's no understanding. I think they do understand their implications that when you have a spectrum right, the far right and the far left, they have a very similar reaction as they drive a person to the other side, the person that sees the far right and sees repulsive racism and bigotry that, you know, build that wall. Fuck these Mexicans, fuck those little kids. They should have known better. They're all illegals. That kind of person that pushes people towards progressivism, it pushes people towards much more liberal, even socialist ideology. It's like fuck that gross snus. And the same thing can be said for someone like, I'm going to send you something, Jamie. This is a real poster that Antifa is sending. They

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       were putting on, um, on wall, on walls and fence posts and shit in the Pacific northwest. And it's actually kind of hilarious because it's so stupid. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Send it to Jamie and Jamie's going to put it up on the screen here, but, uh, it, it says, whoops, wrong one. Jamie, sorry. Jamie Kilstein. Here you go buddy. I just sent it. It says, when you date a white, it's not all right. And it's like, it's telling people to not date white people. Propagation of lights is propagation of hatred, oppression, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, racism, enablism. Now followers. So are we supposed to sterilize white people? There it is. We can see it up on the big screen. So it's even closer because it's large. But see, this is the thing. Racism is. Racism is terrible, right? So how do you stop racism? Racism is, can only be perpetrated by white people.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       Oh, well the problem is white people. We've got to stop white people. Well now you're racist. Like you're literally being racist to stop. Is this really? Well, there are people are finding it and posting it online and someone sent it to me. Um, I don't know if it's everywhere. It's probably just one asshole. Right? But the person exists, but that person exists and they think they're a progressive. Do you see the cold civil war that we're in in this country? No, I hope not. That's why I worried about this punch style. This go. No one knows. If we did, we could make a lot of money in the stock market. This is, this is why I'm concerned, especially because I understand violence a lot better than most people do. You can't just say go punch people when raise the Oslo and says, have you seen a more punchable face that is so fucking dangerous because you're almost saying, go punch this kid.

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       I saw someone else. I accidentally favored something. I didn't mean to favorite favorite it. I did. Someone pointed to me and I'm just lucky that I looked at it because I normally don't even read comments, but somebody pointed out that I favored a really preposterous tweet that said, honest. It said the reply from the school is pathetic and impotent. Name these kids. Oh, that's Kathy Griffin a. here's the one that said it. This guy said, God damn it, I can't find it. He was basically saying, no need to hear. It is a face like that never changes. This image will define his life. No need, no one need ever forgive him, and this is the person with the blue check mark by their name. No one need ever forgive him. A face like that defines his life. That is virtual signaling in the most toxic form, so, so dangerous to think like that. The idea of it just. I'm sorry. Trying to. No, it's okay. The idea that people cannot change to irredeemable, right is crazy. Cancel culture. I was talking about this with, with Kanye. Honestly.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       You're talking about cancel cultures here on the show. We're talking about a person on the phone. Okay. Just going to be on the show. Cool. Allegedly, he's a little nervous to see him with a Samurai sword posing and he would go with the Elon musk on that poster. It's been. It was first posted over two years ago and it's supposedly as a like a troll. Oh yeah, that makes sense. But this is the world where it's hard.

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       Define what's a troll was. What I was going to say that if I was cynical, I would say that if I was a person who is like far right, I wouldn't put that up. Of course, just to fuck with these people and sweet people. I mean it's basically like some CIA psyops type shit. You know what I mean? This is this worth so through the looking glass here. They'll like that post that I just read you. That's a real post about this guy is unredeemable. No one knew. Never forgive him. That's just as bad in my opinion. Is that poster saying, don't date white people. It's all crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:30:39       We pressing no, no. Here's the thing. You have to like fight. I have to fight this feeling of despair. You have to like, I find myself fighting it because the basic like some like basic virtues, right? That used to be normal, right? Like civility, civility has now become, for some people a code word for like complicity with Nazi-ism. Like if you're, if you're civil and you believe in civility and you believe in, you know, treating people decently and with giving them the benefit of the doubt like that, that word itself has become a code or a signal in a negative way. Empathy, like human doubt. Even saying it. I don't know. You know, I, I just, these basic virtues seemed to have been swept away and I don't know when they, when they got lost.

Speaker 1:          00:31:31       Well, a key ingredient for sure. The thing that hardened the epoxy was trump. I think these trends, these trends are going in that direction anyway, but he capitalized on that. You know, he's a very smart manipulator. He knew how to capitalize on that. I mean, this chant of build that wall, it's not an accident. That's something that he concentrates on and it's not just that it's there. We're in a political battle right now because if they get him to back down off the wall, then he looks like a loser when 20, 20 comes around, he looks less powerful to all those people. There's that for sure, but there's also this. He's so egregious like everything. He's so he sold that guy.

Speaker 2:          00:32:11       Well, he's gotten rid of all the guardrail, like he's broken the damn. My question, like thinking about how we're going to get beyond this is how do we build it back because he's broken something or he signifying the fact that it was broken. One or the other. I think that he was both a symptom of something that was broken that we didn't recognize and now he's further catalyze that, broken it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:31       Well, I think both sides have to recognize that the other side has some points. That's one thing, and then I think we also have to treat ourselves like all family. We're all in a big team because that's what we really are. If we really are the United States of American, I mean what? What is it? What is a country? I mean if anything, we're supposed to be a team. The idea that we're separated and were two teams in this one team. The real differences in terms of who gets elected, like how it's going to affect your life, involve business, involves some social policies, involve some things, but the way we interact with each other on a day to day, it doesn't involve that at all. That has to be fixed first. The way we think about each other on a day to day basis. They used to be a time where you could have a conservative friend and you can be a liberal and you could be a fucking long haired Hippie guy and as long as you're a good hardworking person who didn't let their long go crazy, your next door neighbor who was like a goldwater Republican would talk to you and you would go, how's it going, Mike?

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       What's going on with, oh, you know, guys at the forest or try to put together this case and this and that, and you know, a professor could live right next to a cop and they would be friends and one would be conservative and one would be liberal and they would make fun of each other a little bit and rib each other a little bit and that would be the end of it. That would be it. It wouldn't be this civil war that we're experiencing right now, right now, just verbal and hopefully it stays that way, but it's. It's, it's confusing. It's confusing because there's a lack of a frustrating lack of empathy that when I look at human beings and when I look at people that aren't seeing what everyone else was seeing or they're not seeing things objective, Lee and their rational and overly emotional, I always assume there's something else to running from.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       I always assume when I see someone lashing out and insulting everyone around them, I always assume it's not the people around that it's something internal. There's some something, maybe some existential angst. They're fighting against some realization of the futility of life. Whatever the bucket is mean. Finite organisms playing this game as if it lasts forever and accumulating stuff is if it's going somewhere with you like it's going to get in that wooden canoe and the God is going to take it with you in the afterlife. It's nonsense and somehow or another we know this and we as especially as people get older, they seem to push it further and further in the back of their mind and they get more and more ideologically based. They're less open minded. They're less open to nuance. It's very rare to see a 65 year old guy switched parties that's calcified. You become that guy, you know? Yeah. That fucking asshole uncle that has a couple of drinks in them and starts talking about the gays, you know, and this and that and all the things that are wrong with our culture, the sodomites, you know, people start talking crazy. Ever heard that at a Thanksgiving dinner? I haven't either.

Speaker 1:          00:35:24       But um, I think there's a few things that can help us. One I think is just time realizing that these stupid fucking blow ups over this kid and the discussion that comes afterwards, hopefully some of this will settle down. We're allowed to have disagreements. We're allowed to have opinions about how these kids should have behaved, were allowed to have ideas in there, in our minds about how, how you would behave if you were that kid, but I don't think you're allowed to dock some. I don't think you're allowed to even say that. I don't think you're allowed to say that you want to punch him. I think that needs to become socially unacceptable to do that. Yeah. You need, you need to be checked for that because that's, you know when, when someone says things like eyes him who's, who's punched him, he punched you buddy.

Speaker 1:          00:36:13       Who's ever punched you? Punched. Feels like he might. Georgia probably punch them. Jordan's more of a I'll punch you type of a guy. I don't think Sam would ever say you would punch somebody. I cannot. I have to say I can not imagine everything that's on that. I will punch you. Well, you know the feeling of I'm going to punch you, but I can never imagine it's. Yeah, I mean, unless you're protecting someone you care about or your own self. Although I did see this amazing video of Buzz Aldrin to. Do you see this? Oh, punching the guy who said that he didn't go to. I know that guy. That Guy Bart cerebral that he punched. I went to the moon landing tonight. Oh yeah. Alex Jones. I used to be a moon landing denier. I used to believe. I used to believe totally that we never went to the moon because there was a documentary that came on Fox.

Speaker 1:          00:36:56       Yes. Trust me. No, I didn't, I didn't go to number four in the 19 nineties in the 19 nineties, Fox had a show called conspiracy theory. Did we go to the moon and they aired it on television, prime time. They got me hook, line and sinker, and for years I believe that we didn't go to the Mon. What changed you? Mostly talking to neil degrasse tyson, but also critical thinking. Also realizing that I Was fully committed to that idea without really exploring the possibility whether that idea was incorrect and that I would take in everything that I saw in that documentary, which is incredibly convincing and with 100 percent confirmation bias, I only looked at that and I didn't look at all the contrary evidence. There's some fucked up stuff about the moon landing unfortunately. And the fucked up stuff is mostly people that were involved in publicity that we're doing stupid things with photographs.

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       Like they had taken a picture of, I'm going into unchartered territory or just say like, you're an expert on this. I've never gotten into landing. Denialism was buzz aldrin. Um, who was the guy that was Michael Collins? Michael collins in gemini 15 photographs. He seen it many times. Pulled up that photo. This is what I'm talking about. No, no, no. It has nothing to do with that. This is a photo that they, uh, they put out as an official photograph of Michael Collins doing a spacewalk, but what it actually is, is a photo of them testing equipment and they blacked out the backgrouNd. So he's in this suit that they were doing with testing and instead, because they really couldn't get good photos in space because no one's out there with him taking his pictures. Right. So they lied. They faked it. This is it. So the see the one on the left, you see the real photograph and this is him in a studio where they're working on him or warehouse rather or some sort of a testing environment working on how to control these harnesses that you would use when you're on a space walk because that thing propels him forward and back and he's learning how to use it.

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       What they did was they just blacked out the background and reversed it and then they sold that as him actually being in space. So this is probably an overzealous publicists and there's a bunch of these. There's a bunch of these when it comes to different backgrounds in areas of the moon, there are many, many miles apart from each other. It shouldn't be the same background and more likely than not what you're dealing with is overzealous publicist because photographs were incredibly difficult to get. I'm sure.

Speaker 2:          00:39:23       Well, the morAl of the story to me, thank god first of all that you're no longer a moon landing denier, but also the power of the media and the press and like you saw one documentary, right? There's a couple after I saw that. Quite a few, but that sent you down this rabbit hole and that, you know, I've been thinking about. Did you see that roku is, I think d platformed. Info wars,

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       yes. Instantly, like within a day. But I wanted to ask you a question before we get.

Speaker 2:          00:39:49       Okay. Because I have to say I feel. I think I support that because I don't want like in an age in which people don't know, okay, like a 15 year old clicking through their roku doesn't necessarily know the difference between cnn and info wars and the New York times and msnbc and whatever, and of course some of those other ones have biases obviously, but info wars promotes conspiracy theories and do I want a 15 year old kid stumbling into that and thinking that that information is on par on a level with actual facts

Speaker 1:          00:40:29       fix. The problem with conspiracy theories is that some of them are real. This is the real problem. The problem is you don't know which ones are real, but some of them are real. The gulf of tonkin that got us into the Vietnam war. You're aware of that? Okay, but sandy hook, sandy hook for sure happened. Bunch of kids died and these are horrible. These are horrible evil conspiracies. The problem is loaded by Alex Jones. Yes. It's horrible. Without a doubt, and I saw the media matters clip that I'd never seen before. I saw it recently. When you clip the one that shows every time he brought it up. Oh, amazing. How just one time. Oh, I know many, many, many tImes and was saying it was an absolutely fake thing. Has he ever apologize backed off of the position now? But I think because of the lawsuit or I'm sure it's a lot of things. I'm sure it's the pressure. It sorts. It has to be a realization that he knows that it really did happen, but there's a giant group of people out there that still believe it didn't happen and they still confront these parents even in court and they call them crisis.

Speaker 2:          00:41:29       No, I know that the time. it's done. Amazing reporting on this. Elizabeth Williamson. Mild sick.

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       It's sick. It's twisted. Um, we probably shouldn't. I mean we can go into conspiracy theories. I just don't know to go into. It's not a bad thing to go into because it's a thing. Okay. But it's, it's, you know. I'm curious what you think drove around. what do you think of roku taking info wars up? Oh, I think we have to decide what, what is twitter? What is facebook? What is youtube? The position that most people have is these are private companies. They can make their own rules. This is just like cbs deciding that if you use a, you know, if you drunkenly yell the n word out at a black police officer, that they don't want you as a newscaster anymore. What, you know, that's a public account or a private company that can make these distinctions. If you take a position, uh, an antisemitic position publicly, they can, they can decide, look, we don't want you on the air anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:42:27       And then there's other people that think freedom of speech in this form is so important and that the answer to bad ideas is not stopping those ideas. It's good ideas. It's good ideas confronting those ideas and you see it all work itself out. That's, that's the does the other side of the coin. That's the other side of the argument. The argument that we should treat, whether it's twitter or youtube or any of these social media platforms as a public utility and they, you should be able to distribute information. The real problem is with all of this, is that it's very messy. The, the, there's, this is a nuanced issue. There's a lot going on because when you do decide to deep platform someone for having an awful position and spreading a false conspiracy about that, most people are gonna agree with you, but the question is, does it stop there and does it move on to you are a person who believes in white nationalism.

Speaker 1:          00:43:25       What does that mean? Well, I believe that black pride is fine, but I also believe white pride is fine. What about those people? Where do we go with them? Then it gets slippery and then jason. Yeah, jason, I met people that have given the outright of platform, you know, what are they, are they a part of the problem now? Should we d platform them? I mean, this is one of the things that, there was a, uh, a paper that someone had put together an article that was hilarious where it's like everyone has this very bizarre connection. It's six degrees of kevin bacon. Yes, exactly. And but, but they're using yet in terms of the way the connections is almost, if it's scientific data, well they would basically say have you or something like. Well they did say to me, they said, have you, you're a gateway to the outright. Yes. So what I said is Barbara Walters interviewed castro. Does that make her a communist? What the fuck are you talking about? Exactly. pretty left. Like, just ask me questions. Like if you want to know I'm not going to hide my positions on things from you. I, I'm very open. Obviously. I've told people I used to believe the moon landing was fake. I'll tell you all the stupid shit I believed, but

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       the question with this is it, why do people want that? because it's simple and easy. Just get them, get rid of them, punch them, punch the nazis. It's lazy, stupid people thinking and they're thinking publicly and they, uh, they represent a progressive viewpoint with their lazy, stupid thinking. It's not that progressivism and progressive viewpoints or bad is that lazy, stupid thinking. And applying a progressive viewpoint is bad. It's not even that socialism is bad. I've been thinking a lot about socialism lately in terms of like what is the point if if we get to a certain point and then our our hot, our heart stops beating and we dye it and you, you left behind $18, billion dollars to your kids because you were the ultimate capitalist and you went hog wild. That sets a fool's path. That Is a nonsense path. Like why did you do that?

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       like why didn't you try to use that money, this insane amount of wealth and have this massive impact on, on the populous? Why? Why didn't you try to figure out some way? Right? It wouldn't be a choice to but what if bill gates right now, but what if this bill gates is doing that and a lot of ways with some of the money tomorrow if he throws a million here or there, it really ain't shit for him and he's gotten like $90,000,000,000, whatever it is. But the point is that things like the fire department, we agree this is a socialist thing, right? We were all chip in. We have public utilities, we have people that parks and recreation, people that are department of fish and wildlife and the sheriffs that patrol our national forest. We all chip in to pay for these things. We all agree these are important thIngs.

Speaker 3:          00:46:25       Well, one of the things that was so interesting about Australia is that in certain ways it's a more, you know, it's thought of as sort of a macho culture, maybe more masculine, a little bit more conservative than here generally, and yet the left has one. There are so many of the major issues that we're fighting. We're killing each other over now. They're very universal healthcare. Yeah. mandatory 401k $18 minimum wage pensions, four weeks of vacation a year. Like I think they get maternity leave as well. It's just like so many of the things that are up for grabs, they already solved. I think we have to take things into consideration. One that they have a small population, small in homogenous in its enormous place. You're dealing with a place as large as the contiguous United States of America, but there's only 20 million people on way because when they were like, it's crowded in that restaurant, and I was like, you mean I don't have to wait for an hour to get in? They, no, they've never seen a crowd of people. They don't know what a real crowd is. And also I think their culture

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       is less constrained by history because they came, they were essentially prisoners. I mean

Speaker 4:          00:47:37       several generations removed. Exactly. Yeah. But it's not, not only that they're not indigenous. No. I mean like the non indigenous population prisoners. Yes. Yeah, well they came from, they were sent there because england and warm and that's literally how the country got founded for like stealing a watch. Like they were low level. Then they sent them to the much better place. Oh yeah. Way better. It's, I'm a gold coast. You're like, holy shit. It just takes forever to get fewer manchester. It's raining everyday, like fuck this place

Speaker 1:          00:48:06       and you, you know, you stole a watch and they shipped you off to the gold coast. She be like,

Speaker 4:          00:48:11       what? What just happened? This is hilarious. Your fish out here. It's fucking beautiful. They're nice

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       people and I, I wonder if they're so nice. I feel like they are slightly less nice than canadians who are way more nice than us.

Speaker 4:          00:48:26       I think that's right. I also think that they have. They have it so good that they're a little complacent and that makes me concerned because China. Okay. Right. That's the big story there.

Speaker 1:          00:48:39       Yes. Yes. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Well, you know, that is to be considered, but I think the United States, first of all, we have this momentum of innovation and of ass kicking and, and, and getting things done and creating things that's so different than any other part of the world. If we took that shit down a notch, I think we'd be okay. You know, I mean I think we definitely do have to worry about China and know I've been really trying to closely follow all this walway stuff where these executives keep getting arrested and you know, It's the close relationship between some tech companies and this communist government is very confusing, but some people look it over. So if you talk to people that are chinese natives or who have been to China, they almost look at as a positive. There's less resistance. It's more. Even though the censorship is open, it's at least you know what you're dealing with over there as opposed to, you know, the nsa is spiraling up.

Speaker 4:          00:49:43       Oh, I don't buy It at all, but it's, I've seen some people make that argument. It's horrifying. It's weird. it's horrifying. So I agree. I agree with you. You do have to worry about China, but I think Australia is like, ah, it's fucking americans take care of it. So they think sorta, except like their situation is that they're enormously economic. They're enormously dependent on China economically and they love having that money, but they seem to be a little bit like sleep walking through history and not is at least some people that I spoke to it, but that's. That's the real story in Australia is China. Well, I think

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       when you're not a military might, you know, you're not like one of the big players. you're kind of like sitting back watching because what are we going to do? Like what if Australia decides to ramp up its defense budget by 5,000 percent over the next 10 years and develop a crazy arsenal of weapons and super soldiers and shoot them all off the steroids, give them exoskeletons and get ready to go to war, start building bunkers and freak the rest of the world out and take this like North Korea with money approach the world in North Korea with money. Well, norTh Korea is basically like this scary spot that nobody wants to invade even though we know that there's a military dictatorship there. They have their weapons, we have nuclear weapons, they have a madman who's in control. They have people that escaped with horrific stories and we have a president who talks about them as if they're sort of a normal country.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       Yeah. Well the weird thing is like he might be able to sit down with them and actually talked to them is his unconventional approach might actually lead to some sort of communication at least. Which is better than nothing I guess, but. But if. I don't mean like in North Korea, like they take over the country and in prison it's people. I mean like they're, they become kind of dangerous and sketchy and small. Like North Korea is not a military dick power. Like in terms of like the way the soviet union is where they could take over the world, but they're scared but they're untouchable. Yeah, exactly. If Australia became that, then I think we have a totally different attitude about Australia. Australia, Australia is just laid back and they're like, hey, americans take arabic and then we're over here building fucking walls and shooting missiles. Yeah. I would imagine it would be really weird to watch us from afar if you were paying attention to world politics

Speaker 4:          00:52:03       because they know everything. I mean, everyone I talked to there was like, let's talk about gerrymandering in Virginia, and I'm like, what are you saying? They have to follow what's going on here in ways that I found kind of amazing, like genuinely actually gerrymandering in Virginia. I was like, there, don't you have the news going on for a year? If the answer is sort of note. YeAh.

Speaker 1:          00:52:28       Comedians move over there. They move over there and become huge in Australia. Shout out to my friend, judge barker. He's out there. It's huge. Gigantic over there. Like a lot of people don't know him here in Australia. He's like jerry seinfeld, huge, enormous sells a huge auditoriums,

Speaker 4:          00:52:44       but that's because when a giant american celebrity comes over, they're just going to sell out everything because that's the only game in town. No, he's not a giant american celebrity. He's an australian celebratory seinfeld. No barker. I thought we're talking about jerry seinfeld. I'm like, oh yeah, I know you're into like alternative media platform that I think people know seinfeld. It's no arch barker. I'd never heard of him. There you go. There you go. He's here to Australia. When I talked to australians and they're like, oh, you stand up comedian, you know odg bucket. They're gonna be mad at me like Adam Green. She's gonna. Be pissed. Right. That fucking australian accents. Terrible brow. It is bad. It's not good. I don't even try. But have you been following the women's march stuff at all or no? Yes. Yes I have. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       the uh, antisemitic stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking groups. You know when you have a group, you have a group of people and then you have.

Speaker 2:          00:53:35       That was a little bit to me as related to the, what happened at the lincoln memorial, right? Where you had these, you know, the leadership of the women's march, which looked like a shepard fairey poster come to life. Like they were just perfect. You had linda sarsour and her hijab behind tamika mallory. what's going on is that back in August, 2017, I wrote a column called wouldn't progressive's embrace hate, and it was saying I was super moved by the women's march as so many other women. I know we're, but let's look at some of the very troubling ideas and associations that the people who are in charge of the leadership of the women's march have, namely the worst of the worst was tamika mallory, who'd been in gun rights activists beforehand. She called louis farrakhan the goat, the greatest of all time. She took lots of instagram pictures.

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       You should check this, but she praised him. It wasn't like a casual acquaintance. She praised him as the greatest of all time and yet she was treated to glowing profiles in every women's magazine, her and the rest of the leadership. And I basically said like, let's look past, you know, the benetton ad of these leaders and actually look at what they believe and what they believe. Some of them is extremely disturbing, especially when it comes to jews say, write this column. And I'm like pilloried for it. By the left. One of the leaders of the women's march, this woman bob bland, wrote this letter to the New York times where she calls me, um, it was amazing. I want to find what it was. Oh, she calls me an apologist for the status quo, racist ideology and the white nationalist patriarchy because you responded to someone because I said greatest of all time is a man who called judaism termites who calls juice termites, who calls judaism a gutter religion, who says that we should burn in ovens and who by the way is a massage and homophobe also the leaders of the women's march or associating with this guy and had the nation of islam security protecting them.

Speaker 2:          00:55:42       I mean this is Like the most sort of retro grade hate group and yet for calling them out, I was called all of these things

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       flies.

Speaker 2:          00:55:52       That's a deep question. I think that part of it is the fact that in intersectional leftwing politics, jews have been whitewashed. Jews are viewed as sort of the white privileged power and part of the white patriarchy and less. They genuflect and say, actually, no, we, you know, we have poor our privilege and all of the other things that you're supposed to say, and there's a blIndness to the fact great, and there's a blindness to the fact that first of all, not jews are white. Half of the jews in the state of Israel, for example, are arab and from arab countries that they were kicked out of a 19, 48. I mean the idea that jews are white is this canard. Although I'm an ashkenazi jew, I'm my family is from eastern europe. I have white skin but I don't think of, and I have white privilege, but I don't think of myself as white person.

Speaker 2:          00:56:43       I think of myself as a jew first and foremost, so it's a complicated identity, but I think that it's sort of a. It's whitewashed by these people and I think that antisemitism just isn't taken seriously and doesn't rate because people perceive jews as having privilege and power in this country, which largely they do. But the fact is is that the actual statistics show that more hate crimes were committed against jews in the past year than any other minority group. The fbi's like sounding the alarm every other day in crown heights and in other parts of brooklyn, random jews who looked jewish, right? Who were hasidic. Jews are just beaten up for being jewish. and yet everyone's ignoring that because they're the imperfect victim will. They're also very isolated. They're very. They have their own tribe. They stick with them, they look different, they dress different. Sure. But imagine if any other minority group, someone.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       I mean, we're outraged when we see at least i am. And you are. When we see a police officer assaulting someone, you know what I'm saying is the young black person, they don't make a big deal to go into the public about it. They keep it almost insulated inside their environment and their community. There's also, what I was going to say is that these people that are, that you do here saying antisemitic things, they're equating american jews living in America with the policies of Israel and what Israel is doing with palestine. And that somehow if you're an american jew, even if you're not even political, you're somehow or another complicit with atrocities that are going on between the jewish people and the palestinians, right? Conflict, any kind of conflict. And this makes it. It reinforces their idea about you being a part of this group. Yes, but they also straw men it and say, criticism of Israel is an antisemitic.

Speaker 2:          00:58:37       No one's saying that criticism isn't of Israel antisemitic. I criticize Israel at the time, but there's an obsession on the state of Israel. Like if you were an alien that landed from outer space, you would think that the greatest oppressor in the world is this tiny state that's the size of New Jersey. These people say nothing about the genet generally about the genocide of weger muslims in China. They say nothing about any number of even aware that, oh, there's a genocide going on, carried out by the government of China against weaker muslims. They're literally being put into concentration camps. This is literally a first. I've heard of this. So [inaudible] is spelled you I g, h, you are. Whereas a, what is a good thing to read about the New York times that we've reported on it, it's a, it's an enormous story and it's like the fact that that's getting know that you don't know about it and that people obsessive talk about the state of Israel is if it's the and by the way the state of Israel does lots of things wrong, but the idea that it's among the worst human rights tragedies of our time.

Speaker 2:          00:59:44       Are you kidding me? It's insanity.

Speaker 1:          00:59:47       I don't know the reality of what is going on in gaza. I don't know what is happening with Israel and palestine. I don't know, so I'm not going to be the person that talks about this, but what I do know some stuff to read, but I do know from people that have gone there like abby martin, who, who came back with some pretty horrific stories. I think there's a lot of terrible shit going on. There's a lot of awful violence and there's a lot of despair on the side of the palestinians and I don't. I don't know who's to blame for that, but many people blame the israelis. They blame the israelis for treating the palestinians as if they're in this one area of the world is essentially a large prison.

Speaker 2:          01:00:26       Well, lots to say about this, but I think one of the main problems that we have in the way that Israel is covered is that if you have a camera lens and you're only looking at a tiny piece of land, right, you're only looking at Israel proper. The west bank and gaza, Israel to some extent is the goliath in that situation, but if you zoom out your camera just a little, you see that Israel is literally surrounded on all sides by genocidal regimes like in the form of hamas in gaza, whose charter blamed the jews for fomenting that. The french revolutions, the russian revolutions, both world wars and says that it wants to kill all the jews. That's what. That's the government of gaza right now. I spoke to a mother who fled gaza recently. okay. And her family's house was just destroyed. Who was it destroyed by? Hamas, not Israel. You never hear those storIes. So I'm just saying it is a very complicated politics, but when you see people obsessively focusing on this one state and the crimes of this one state to the exclusion of actual dictatorships in the world who are killing their own people, you have to be suspicious of that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:45       You do have to be suspicious and you do have to be aware of their position in the world surrounded by arab states. When you do have to realize that they are there, they're alone out there. You also, I do wonder, what is the motivation for so many people focusing on jews? What is it like? What do you think it is as a jewish person? What do you think the motivation for this kind of racism and discrimination against jews and why is it tolerated? Why? Why can someone like louis farrakhan tweet that jews are in

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       his twitter account, stays up. It's the olDest hatred in the world, right? a lot of exam what it is. No, no, no. You're asking me why is it still with us? It's like the mystery of history like that is. That is deep. I mean, that is something that goes back to the new testament. Okay. The jews were blamed in the book of john and mark. I mean, we could go to matthew for the death of jesus. Their role in that story, at least according to some of the books, is that they convinced the most powerful empire at the time, the roman empire in the form of the governor of judea, punches pilot to kill the son of god. That becomes sort of the template for the antisemitic conspiracy theory. There's, there's a confusion about what antisemitism is, right? It's not just a hate. It's not just like this.

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       Hate of a group racist perceived themselves as punching down against a group that's lesser antisemites perceive themselves as punching up against the secret cabal of wildly operators who secretly controlled the leavers of power. That is the canard of antisemitism, and that begins with this group that's able somehow to get the roman empire to kill jesus. Now, the catholic church disavows this in 1965, which was an enormous historical event, but that template is still there and you see it play out right in who? Who led us into the war in Iraq, it was the jews of the bush administration. You can see it play itself out all over the place and right now in the demonology of current contemporary antisemitism, Israel has sort of been made into the jew among the nations. You're not allowed to say anymore. It's like the old school antisemitism, right? Like I grew up in a place where there was some country clubs where jews couldn't go into them.

Speaker 2:          01:04:05       That frankly, that's not dangerous. What's dangerous is the kind of antisemitism that says, you know, this one state in the world of all of the, almost 200 states, that's the one that doesn't have the right to exist. That's the one that should be dismantled. That's actually dangerous to jewish lives right now. It is. Um, it's an unusual group in that it is both a religion and a tribe. Yes. It makes us very hard to understand in the contemporary landscape because we are not just a religion. There's nothing else like it. Because most jews that I know do not practice judaism. Right. And yet they choose us because we were a people hood before we were a religion. Religion is a very contemporary, modern thing that jews are sort of slotted into and it makes us easier to understand. But then our, our sort of national identity or peoplehood, our tribalism is left out and that's an essential part of who the jews are.

Speaker 2:          01:04:59       My friend ari shaffir, who's a fantastic stand up comedian, he's a rabid atheists, but he's also very jewish and he has a new hour that he's working on right now that is going to film called jew. I want to see it, but he's, you know, he's a perfect example is a tribe. It's not just a religion, but it's also because the jewish religion itself, the emphasis, the emphasis is not on what you believe. The emphasis is on deeds. It almost doesn't matter what you believe. It matters that you follow, hahaha. Which is jewish law matters your deeds. It matters all these things. So it's possible to be a good jew and not really think about god that much, which is very strange. I understand. To christian ears or you go full ben shapiro where he's both a good jew and very much like follows the whole deal the whole deal, the whole deal.

Speaker 2:          01:05:56       Um. Why do you say that? I think. Sorry, can I say one more place? I just find it like kind of astonishing the blindness to this because imagine a leader of the women's march said something like, you know, I think louis ck is the greatest comedian of all time even though I disavow x, y, and z thing that he did. How fast to let person was kicked out of the leadership of the women's march. It would be like minutes hours. Yes. I think there are certain things that get people outraged and other much worse things that do not. And I'm fascinated by why that is. Do you think that if it was a white person that had this opinion about the jews, that it would be more scrutinized? I think thAt it is much easier to fight antisemitism when it comes in the form of Richard Spencer. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:06:46       Because then there's liberal consensus, right? About him. He's have a green light to criticize. It is much harder when, when an an. Exactly. it's much harder when someone like ilhan omar, the new freshman senator. Uh, sorry. Not senator, the new freshman congresswoman for Minnesota who's like this incredible american dream story comes here at 12 years old, refugee from Somalia, wears a hijab, is a mother, is the first woman of color representing Minnesota. Like obviously I want to cheer her. That's my reaction to her and yet she has this tweet that she refused to apologize is four where she says, Israel is hypnotize. The world may all awake in the world to the evil doings of Israel. I'm sorry. That's a classically antiseMitic trope. Even if she said it unwittingly and by this point she should have known she should eduCate herself. So it's very, it's much harder to criticize that, but it's, it's an untenable position to say that you can't criticize someone for their ideas because of their identity.

Speaker 2:          01:07:49       It also seems like a road to nowhere you're going to say that. That is a very vague thing to say. You should be incredibly specific. Have you want to say it's evil, you should say what's evil and then open that up to some sort of a discussion or debate, but as describing supernatural evil powers to a state is very much recalling classic antisemetic canards. Right. So with that I read, I wrote a piece about this today, trying to like explain that to people because she went on cnn saying, I don't know how jewish americans could be offended by this, which I think is incredible.

Speaker 1:          01:08:24       Cool. Yeah. What do you think if. I mean, if you want to be objective as I mean step outside of your jewish identity, what do you think is wrong with how Israel is dealing with the palestinian situation? Because this is the big criticisM of Israel. The only criticism really that's the big one. The big one is gaza and palestine. So what do you think they're doing wrong?

Speaker 2:          01:08:48       Palestine meaning the west bank? Yes. Well, I would say what the untenable position that they're in is that they are oCcupying another people. That is what is going on in the west bank and I've been there many times, met with many palestinians. I've really educated myself on this. The problem is is that, and by the way, it's not all of palestine. There's all the west bank, there's areas a, b and c. It's a really like we'd have to pull up a map. It's a pretty complicated thinG. There are places where it's much more autonomous and the pa's in charge and it, it really varies depending on the area, so the big criticism, right is that they're occupying and other people and that is corrosive to the state of Israel, sort of morally like to, to occupy and other people. On the other hand, what happens if they pull out of the west bank tomorrow?

Speaker 2:          01:09:37       Right. I'm for a two state solution ultimately ending the occupation, but if I'm real, I have to be honest about what that would look like. WHat would it look like in gaza? Is that now you have a terrorist state lit right at the border which is ruled by hamas. It is quite likely that that very same thing could happen in the west bank. Now let's say actually we actually should pull up a map. Let's say Israel does that. Then like the whole of Israel proper is something like we have to look two miles wide. We actually, yeah, we should look at the, the distance between like tool car, um, or like the end of the west bank and natanya or tel aviv and you see how small that is. I mean it's hard to even conceive of it if you were in charge of Protecting the security of the people who live in places, which by the way, 10 years ago when in the year after high school when I was living there, there were suicide bombings blowing up in cafes around the corner from where I lived. Or you going to subject those people to that risk. I mean that's the, that's the actual question facing the government of Israel, which by the way, I'm extremely critical of and if I lived in Israel, I'd be voting center left in Israel for sure, but that is what they're facing. And then if you zoom out and you pull up a map of all of the countries around it,

Speaker 2:          01:10:59       I just want to look.

Speaker 5:          01:11:02       Sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:11:02       No, iT's okay. Actually the one you were on was good because it showed if you zoomed out it had everything,

Speaker 2:          01:11:10       so you have Egypt there, then you have Jordan, which is teetering, then you Syria, then you of Lebanon and hIs bellows on the southern border of Lebanon, which is constantly, you know, so that's the real thing. So when people talk about this fantasy of why can't it just look like America, why can't there just be a democratic one state solution? First of all, no one wants it. They pull people constantly. But the second thing is like step really what that's gonna look like if we dismantle the state of Israel or is it going to look like enormous bloodshed? The likes of which we see in a lot of these countries surrounding it. Like someone once said to me that if you want to know the word for, you know, a jew without a military, it's the [inaudible]. Okay. It's these eds. It's the people. It's the minorities in the middle east who had been absolutely destroyed and overrun.

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       ANd this is like, it's. I don't think when americans talk about this part of the world, they fully appreciate this sort of absolutely painful and hard decisions and the grappling with violence really, you know, what happened to jamal [inaudible] shogi and that saudi embassy that's like normative for this part of the world. So the fact that Israel has somehow with all of its flaws, managed to eke out a western style liberal democracy, frankly the only place where you and I would feel happy and comfortable living. Like, why are we never talking about that? Well, I think it's very difficult for people to find the forum, to discuss it the way you just did and to to really lay it out in cold, stark reality. What is the solution? What is the solution? There is no magic. The solution right now is to do everything possible to build up the palestinian economy to for Israel to build relationships.

Speaker 2:          01:13:03       Like right now, it has a very, very positive relationships with Egypt, which gave back the sinai, which had had one in the six day, six day war, I believe, gave it back to Egypt for a cold piece, which it's had, it has a good relationship of all things. Who would have thought with Saudi Arabia because of their common enemy? Iran. I mean things shift. They're rapidly, um, but, but as for the palestinians, the solution is to build up the economy, make life better and support people and movements inside the west bank that are genuinely nonviolent. And those people exist. It's just frankly, oftentimes they're murdered by groups like hamas and their bodies are dragged through the streets. If you're accused of being an israeli collaborator in the west bank, you know what happens to you, your lynched? No one talks about that. No, no one does talk about that.

Speaker 2:          01:13:54       What would you be open to discussing this in this sort of a form with that woman from the women's march a. Sure. Do you think she would do something like that? I don't know. I'd be open to it. Do you think that people like her have ever had a conversation with someone like you who could lay it out? No, because I think that first of all, many people who talk about this issue have sort of exported aMerican domestic politics to a foreign region of the world. Like in a way that this is talked about a lot. It's like the oppressor, the oppressed, the white, the blaCk. No, that's not what's going on. I don't think people understand when they talk about israeli jews that half of them are middle eastern, like half of israeli jews are arab, you know, there's no appreciation of that reality.

Speaker 2:          01:14:44       They think that Israel was just founded, you know, to save the remnant of the jews who weren't destroyed in the holocaust and yeah, it helped for those who survived, but then once the state of Israel was established, there was a mass exodus of the jews from all of the arab countries where they had been living as second class citizens where they are either self deported because they were living at as second class citizens or they were expelled. again, that exodus, that deportation never talked about. I'd be happy to talk about this with someone from the women's march. What is the, what is the response currently like what, what? What is the current position that most people were taking about that woman and about the woman's march in general because of these things because of these analysts, antisemitic statements. I think a lot of people in the past few weeks, thanks in part to meghan mccain, had five minutes on the view with tamika mallory and bob land and she did an amazing job grilling them on the view.

Speaker 2:          01:15:43       The view is what's changed? It's amazing. I know, but she did an amazing job because, because frankly because their image was so powerful in the same way that the image of the lincoln memorial was so powerful, journalists just sort of accepted it and didn't interrogate that. Who doesn't want to support that? But it's our job to be skeptical and criticize. Right? So I think finally a lot of people woke up to it. Um, but again, I wrote that column in August, 2017 and it took until now everything in that column is the thing people are talking about. There was also an amazing 10,000 word expos and tablet magazine and jewish online magazine that did a lot of that work, so I think it did reach a tipping point. The thing that is, um, I see a lot of my friends on the left who are jewish grappling with is that they so desperately want to be a part of these movements that they're willing to sort of check their identity at the door in order to gain entry.

Speaker 2:          01:16:42       And my thing is any progressive movement that's asking you to check your jewish identity at the door, your full jewish identity, which is acknowledging that we're not just a faith, but we're at people. We're not just people that like have matzah ball soup or something bigger than that. That's not a space I want to be a part of. They would never ask that. If any other group. Why us? Why? Why do they ask that? That, that, that's what the real question. I really think. Well, no, I think a lot of it goes back to what I was saying before, which is this misunderstanding if you see the world in an intersectional way. Okay, not is intersectionality was originally meant to be, but how it functions in the world, it functions as a caste system and the higher you are on the victim scale, at least on the left and it's reversed on the right, right on the right.

Speaker 2:          01:17:30       It's like white, cis gendered men are at the top on the left there at the bottom and the jews or somewhere close down to there at least in the way that the left the left. I mean this part of the left, we're talking about the fringe at least for now. Perceive the jews to be the woke left. Yeah. The jews are not. The jews don't rate. The jews don't have a place in that victim scale because they have achieved so much success because they can pass as white because of any number of things and so I think that that's a huge reason for it, which is a huge reason why I think intersectionality is a dead end and why we need to be talking about ideas and not identity. Right. Like that. That is the thing about America that is so amazing and like, I know it sounds cheesy, but I really feel it. That makes us so special. We are not a country based on blood and soil. We are a country whose national common identity is based on ascribing to a common set of ideas. That is what we're about and so any politics that's insisting from the left or the right that no, actually what we are is this warring set of groups competing for scarce resources? Absolutely not. To me, those kinds of politics are unamerican.

Speaker 1:          01:18:45       I couldn't agree more in terms of identity. I think identity politics and the idea that you belong to a group is so intoxicating but so dangerous. It'S so important to treat people as individuals. It's so important to think of yourself as an individual and this, this need to become a part of this group in a signal to that group is a big part of the problem that we're having right now

Speaker 2:          01:19:06       and it doesn't mean that you can't have pride. Like I have tremendous pride the most in being a jew and like jonathan heit talks so brilliantly about good identity politics and bad identity politics that good identity politics says, walk with me in my shoes. It's like a big tent sort of thing. It says, come along with me while I explained to you my experience in the world that identity politics says you can never escape the gender of the racial, the economic lane you were born into and don't even try and understand me because you couldn't possibly. That's bad. Identity politics and I think that that's enforced and rising right now in the country. and I think that that's dangerous and I've been thinking about it a lot because it's martin luther king day and he said this unbelievable thing about. I think it's actually in the.

Speaker 2:          01:19:56       I had a dream speech, but where he talks about the, the promissory note of the constitution and the declaration of independence, right? That these people who wrote it, who were slave owners didn't even know that in writing it. That every american was going to fall heir to this promissory note. And it's like he saw himself even in documents that were written by people who would not have seen them as fully human as a way of sort of using that common set of values, those common documents to like write himself into the story. Like that is an example of, uh, of, of inclusive identity politics and like calling on the thing that we have in common too wide in the tent. And I just don't see a lot of that happening these days. I really butchered that. But everyone should look up to, you know, I did. If you look up, jonathan heit gave a speech, I think you can find the whole text of it at city journal. Um, but if you just look up jonathan heit, good identity politics, martin luther king, he does an amazing job. It's, it's really moving

Speaker 1:          01:21:00       his book, the happiness hypothesis. I'm, I'm in the middle of it right now. It's so good. It's so fantastic. It's so crucial for people that want to understand their own personal biases and what's coming and saying he's amazing. He was on here last week. I thought he was incredible. He is the, the, the, the idea of having pride in something is, is interesting, right? You know, there's a lot of people that have pride for their ethnicity, although they had nothing to do with, with choosing it. It's just something that they're born with. I think people get nervous about that kind of pride, but I think there should be a settling. It would be wonderful if we could keep all of these cultures and yet all appreciate each other as equals. It'd be wonderful if you could go and eat ethiopian food one day or cuban food the next day and they, these people exist in the small. That's the beauty of this. Now. You can right now you can, but as we get more and more homogenized, I wonder if you will be able to

Speaker 2:          01:21:56       wait more homogenized or more insistent on you have to stay in your lane.

Speaker 1:          01:22:00       There's both, both things. I think we're definitely cooking off the bacteria as well. Where we're wearing homogenization is where we're making things safer and easier for everybody and you know, there's some messiness, messiness to cultures exchanging with each other, but it is also fantastic. Very excited

Speaker 2:          01:22:21       to say I loved Australia, but when I get off that plane and I landed at like a shitty as they are at jfk or laguardia and I see like every kind of human being on the planet, you know, and like I walk everyday from I live, um, I live in manhattan and I walked to work. They are in bag everyday. It just helps me decompress and the kind of like the diversity of people on the sidewalk of midtown manhattan. It's amazing. I find it to be the most exciting thing in the world and the fact that we're able to live amongst such difference and not kill each other. Angeles is what drives, you know, you don't have that or you drive there. I love it heRe, but that's why I couldn't live here.

Speaker 1:          01:23:02       Well no one walks. Everyone's locked in together in their. They Stay in their neighborhood and they drive out to go somewhere else and they don't even interact with each other on the street. One of the things about the subway in, one of the things about walking on the street is everybody's together. Everyone's Together. And there's this, this interesting melting pot of human beings that exist in New York. It doesn't exist anywhere else in that form. Like boston is so much more white. It's so much more. I mean there's a lot of ethnicities and. But it's, it's not the same. New york is fucking flavorful. There's a lot of shit going on. It's a lot of great parts to it. It's also what concerns me is that people in New York are uniquely hostile. And then.

Speaker 4:          01:23:41       Yeah, for sure,

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       very nice. But a lot of people that I'm even friends with from New York, I'm like, you mother fuckers are stacked on top of each other too much. You like you, you don'T. People aren't unique.

Speaker 4:          01:23:54       Like would it be fair? I'm from pittsburgh. So you might be getting that like midwestern flavor. I bet that's exactly what it is,

Speaker 1:          01:23:59       is pittsburgh's different. Little more relaxed, leSs people have to count on each other more and fucking snow gets you. It gets rough out there. You know, it's not like you're, you're not in a city the same way. It's not. You got to drive places so different, you know. That is very midwest, pittsburgh, very midwest, nice place. I like pittsburgh, but New York, I love New York, but New York always makes me feel like when you have that many people slammed on top of each other, you're in this completely unnatural environment that literally has never existed in human nature up until a few hundred years ago. Never happened like that and now it's unprecedented because there's more and more people there that just buzzing and they're putting these buildings up. We've. You've got 100 floors. My friend jim norton talks about it all the time because he lives in a building because I don't know a fucking person in my building.

Speaker 4:          01:24:46       Thousand people in the spirit living in a building like that. I could never live in a high rise building. It freaks me out too. what do you live in? Like a small walk? Brownstone. that's a good move. That's a good move up. Sucks, but the. But knowing your neighbor like I. Yeah. I also think as an adolescent, freak me out

Speaker 1:          01:25:04       as an intellectual, as a person like yourself, I think it's incredible important to, to experience this. There's an exchange of cultures and a thought thought in New York that you just don't get. You don't get on the west coast. it's also not entertainment based. There's a frivolousness to the thought process out here that's flavored by the desire for fame.

Speaker 4:          01:25:26       Avoidable. But the one thing I'll say is that, yeah, it's important for that and I find it so energizing New York, all the reasons you said, but I also have to force myself to get out of the bubble. You know, like I go home to pittsburgh and I hear a lot more oftentimes political and intellectual diversity than I hear sometimes in a week in New York. Right? Because everyone's left. most people, everyone in the. Most of my friends are not everyone but everyone. Just conservative people in New York obviously, but it's certainly norman ever left leaning, leaning city, Oregon. Like it's like, oh, people

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       believe a lot of things. You know. My mom was the one who told me that trump was gonna win because she, for her business, we live in squirrel hill. My family, we went, I was bar mitzvahed in the synagogue. That was shot up, so that's where we live in squirrel hill and the jewish neighborhood, but my mom for her work has to drive like two or three hours out of the city and during the campaign she would see every. Everyone I knew thought hillary was gonna win, including me, and she called me and said, barry, you would not believe like the homemade signs, like they're giant homemade signs on this, on the side of people's houses and barns that are enormous. That took them many hours to make. There's a passion for him that I don't think people are fully appreciating. Like I didn't see that everyone I knew was voting for hillary clinton.

Speaker 1:          01:26:49       Right.

Speaker 2:          01:26:52       I don't know, like, I don't know what it's like for you out here

Speaker 1:          01:26:55       is the same. It's. I mean it's incredible. Not, not only is it incredibly left leaning, but is also the entertainment aspect of it where people have to signal the fact that they're left so they'd go out of their way to project this image of being progressive on top of being progressive. It's, it's almost critical to your job. You know, you have to. you have to show everybody you can out progressive with the people

Speaker 2:          01:27:19       in secret. did they tell you what they really think because you're like a safe person?

Speaker 1:          01:27:22       No, no, no. Not those people to people that are like, man, I don't like her, but he's such a piece of shit I'm going to vote for. Anyway. That was more common. The thing was we like socially. People appreciate the democrats and the left because they feel like socially in terms of like, here's a perfect example. When barack obama was the president and you know, people can criticize his policies and the whistle blower or the fact that he cracked down on whistle blowers and the fact that there was more innocent killed by drone strikes and they have all that stuff is. There's certainly some. No one's pr. It's an impossible job. No one's perfect as a president, but what he did do was he represented, first of all, he represented the fact that a minority or an african american who was born from a single mother can somehow or another rise to be the president of the United States and be incredibly well spoken and measured and calm and just seems to know how to carry himself and makes us feel like someone better than us is in a position of power and it also, I feel like there was a lot of racism from what from a horrible white people that looked at him in a terrible way and saw this black person trying to destroy America, but way more people that aren't racist go, huh?

Speaker 1:          01:28:39       Look at that. You can't have an african american president look at this like we're getting better. Like that's how I felt. I felt like we're getting better. Like culturally the way, the way we communicate, we don't have that right now and we didn't have that with her. What she didn't, what she represented was the same old thing. The thing that's been fucking

Speaker 3:          01:29:01       you and the reason why your family lost the farm and the reason why in this donald trump's going to come in here and he's going to clean up the swamp, and when he came out with that drain the swamp and lock her up, build that wall, he boiled it down so that the people that don't have the time or the inclination to really deep dive into their own personal biases to their own objective reasoning and find out what is it? Why do I think the way? I think the people that don't have that thought, all that build, that wall shit was perfect. Line it up and that's most folks. Most folks don't have the time. Most folks Work all day. They're tired. They have a family. they probably have a hobby. they don't have the fucking time. You are a person who thinks for living, you think and write for a living.

Speaker 3:          01:29:45       You're constantly involved. Well, one thing I'm seeing when I asked you about the people, people telling you their secret thought crimes, I am noticing and in a weird way this gives me kind of a hope. There is a big gap between people's public personas of the politics that they preach and then what they really think and what they'll say around the kitchen table and a lot of them are experiencing what I call, what I think about is like second woke, like they're seeing the poverty or the flaws in the wilk worldview and that there are holes with it, but they're kind of too scared to say that out loud because they know it'll be a loss of friends and social capital and everything else. But I, those people talk to me a lot. Those people send me emails a lot and oftentimes there are people with platforms who don't want to lose their audience and I find that somewhat hopeful.

Speaker 3:          01:30:40       I find it somewhat hopeful too, but I also got to nut nut up. Yes, like come out, come on rogan. I figured I'd say something like that met up. It's a good way, but you're right that the thought process behind nutting up is exactly what they need to do. Like what's more people did it. I think you'd realize like, wow, we're kind of surrounded. It's almost like, well, okay. What I think about like I am never the smartest person in any room. I'm not brilliant. I promise you, you're probably smarter than us in this room. Know. I don't know if jamie had to top trust me what makes me. The only reason I'm sitting here is that I have like slightly more courage than most people and that I'm willing to say what I think to hell with pissing some people off or losing some friends that weren't really my friends.

Speaker 3:          01:31:28       Most people aren't willing to do that actually. Well, what I like about your writing in a. What I like about talking to you today is that you represent reason and well thought out opinions and those two things are very rare. Well thought out. Opinions are way more rare in my opinion, than what you usually get, which you usually get is a conglomeration of opinions that seemed to make sense per peripherally or casually. They have a veneer of logic to them and you're like, I'll go with that because I don't have the time because most people don't have the time. Well, going back to Israel, I know we're probably. Are we wrapping up? Going back to Israel for one second. It's become like a pillar, right? It's like, okay, if you're on the left, I believe in criminal justice reform, like any number of things. Oh, and by the way, Israel is bad.

Speaker 3:          01:32:20       Like it became one of those things that most people don't really think about. Right. And like I think it's really important to think about things issue by issue and not just be like, yep, signing up for this whole slew of policies and views on things when actually some of those things don't go together at all. Well, one thing than the woke left, you're not allowed to do is criticize the more repressive aspects of islam. You're not allowed to. You don't do it. If you bring up anything becomes islamophobic in even if it's homophobic thought, if the ideas are homophobic or if women have to wear restrictive clothing, all any, any of the things that are incredibly commonplace, you are not allowed to criticize those because those fall into a protected category. I remember when I first ran into this in college when we were talking, I was in a conversation with other feminists and I definitely consider myself a feminist about female genital mutilation and I encountered for the first time a species that I've come to know well, which is feminist, who sorta defend female genital mutilation on the grounds of cultural relativism.

Speaker 3:          01:33:30       Who are we to judge? And I remember just like I did not get over the shock of that. you shouldn't. That is fucking terrifying. I mean, that is. Look, I'm an outspoken, rabid critic of circumcision. I think it's disgusting. I think it's ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense, but at least your dick still works. The idea that someone tried to equate circumcision and female genital mutilation, a person on the left did when I talked about it recently, some fucking asshole online. I don't remember who it was, but I didn't even. I didn't even exchange. I just, I just, I read it and I went there. Their vagina doesn't work the same way anymore. Do you understand that you can't have an orgasm anymore. You're cutting off a woman's cliteracy too. Not because of cleanliness or any fucking weird logic that they're using today to try to justify circumcision. Way worse, you're. You're doing it to try to eliminate pleasure because you don't want the woman to leave. It'S the same reason why you want to cover up with some crazy, but why barb? But the leaders of the women's march talk about say, I don't know, honor killings, female genital mutilation, forced marriage for, for, for girls, children, children. Instead they're talking about bds in Israel. I don't get it. I'd love to ask someone about that also. Have you been to Israel? No,

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       I have not. I want to take you say yes. I would go. I would go. I would go. I would certainly go. I've got to bring already though. He'll translate. Is that the guy? He's a good friend. Um, and he loves to travel too, so he'd be down in heartbeat. Um, what was I gonna say? Oh, why? Why is it that, do you think that here's, here's a better way for them. Do you think there's too many things to pay attention to? Not just worldwide, but even in terms of like left versus right in, in, in these positions, like I often talk to people about gun control and um, and when people find out that I own guns and the, that I'm not entirely in favor of second amendment being repealed. One thing that drives me crazy is they want to always bring up school shootings, mass shootings, all these different things which I agree are horrific, terrible occurrence in our culture and is happening in this insanely frequent way.

Speaker 1:          01:36:04       And it doesn't make sense, but people don't want to talk about is that almost all those people are on psych medication. Almost all of them right now, correlation does not equal causation. Them being on the psych medicine might be the same reason why they're shooting up schools in the first place. They're, they're incredibly mentally unwell and legally buy a gun. It's insane. It's insane. That's great. Yeah. One hundred percent. Not only do I think that you should then here's the question, who are, who is the person to decide, and this is the what the nra would say, and this is what a pro second amendment people would say. Who are you to decide whether or not someone is healthy enough or well enough to own a gun and does a person who is on antidepressants or person who has psychological problems not have the ability to defend themselves if they have never exhibited violence, so here's the problem.

Speaker 1:          01:36:54       A lot of these mother fuckers, they don't exhibit violence until they break until they pop and then they'd go shoot up a school. Sometimes there's threats like adam lanza or a couple other ones were the fbi comes and visits them and they talked to them or the guy in Colorado where they knew he was like hanging on by a string, but he was on that gap, which I think is like a far writer. It's definitely used by the fire, right? It's used by the far right. The problem is when you have no restriction whatsoever and you have restriction and all these other ones, right? If you say something antisemitic or racist on twitter, they will ban you. If you do it on facebook, they'll ban you and gab is committed 100 percent of free speech. I've. I've read things the owners of gab have said about this and that they're. They're very steadfast in their support for freedom of speech because they think what I said earlier that the best way to ensure that good ideas get through is to not suppress bad ideas, but to combat them with better ideas. I was going to say is that the guy who shot up

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       the synagogue in pittsburgh was saying the most horrific things about the cake infestation in your country

Speaker 1:          01:38:02       on gab and that's. That's where the question is, well, should someone like roku pull Alex Jones? Should they take off?

Speaker 2:          01:38:10       I think that this is a real question like as someone who's to myself on the free making the free speech argument a lot, I think it's something that we really, really have to grapple with. IT really. It's almost like we're dealing with crude tools, like we're trying to perform surgery with hatchets oh fuck man, how do you get to those people and have that discussion with all those people, but this is. I mean in terms of there being too much to talk about and cover, that's where I do think that things like the New York times can make a real contribution because we like there are adults in the room deciding what the important news is that you should pay attention to in theory at least. Well, no, I, I wholeheartedly agree. You know, you're going to learn about the genocide of the week muslims in the New York to and like if you really read the New York times every day, you're going to know a lot about the world and you're going to understand that the government shut down is a bigger deal than what happened on the steps of the lincoln memorial. If you're just trolling through twitter, which is how like every person I know, or twitter or snapchat or whatever, like my youngest sister, how she gets her news, you're not going to necessarily know that. That's a real problem is I don't know how to solve it other than tell people to subscribe to newspapers, which still have some standards and which still when they make a mistake, correct. The mistake.

Speaker 1:          01:39:33       How many of those are left? There's a few. Yeah, I work at one of them. One of them. You definitely do. I mean, look, I. I said something to someone from the New York times online after a, an article that they wrote about a fight. There was a boxing match economy. Mcgregor and floyd mayweather were congress. It was a great fight. Floyd made with school them, but at the end it said that conor mcgregor's face was swollen and bleeding and he was knocked through the ropes and I said, you can't say that because everybody saw the fight. That didn't happen in this crazy time where everybody is crying out for fake news. You can't say his face was covered in blood when there was no blood. You can't say that like don't do. That was corrected. It was corrected.

Speaker 2:          01:40:21       Which is so rare, but it's actually not. We correct things. Yes, all the time. Right, but how do you stop it from happening in the first place? How do you stop that one? Well, no, the first one is really high blood. No, no blood when it doesn't exist. I'm sorry, what I'm saying it's really hard. What I mean is journalists just shouldn't make mistakes like that, but we do the difference with the New York times and any number of these other places is that we say we made a mistake and we correct. Well, it's high part matters pros. It's like someone having getting ahead of themselves having a little too much fun. Don't remember that article.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Well, it wasn't necessarily think it's getting ahead and read some fiction. They applied fiction to an actual sport event, which I thought was bizarre, but. But they correct. They did correct it. Well, here's what's important. What's important is you can at least get a better version of the facts there than you can anywhere else.

Speaker 2:          01:41:11       Yes, and I, I guess there's some people in the new media landscape that I see and I don't know if it's because they want to sort of join up their own audiences are what like nihilistic getting like using trumpist language to describe the press. Would they don't see? Would they don't know? I think what they don't understand is that the loss of trust in the press is a symptom of the loss of trust in lots of public institutions. The who, the world health organization just came out with this terrifying report. We're like one of the top 10 threats to health in. I think the country you should, we should look this up, is people who aren't getting vaccines. People who think vaccines cause autism and are not getting vaccines. The stakes of like loss of trust in public institutions doesn't just mean like you're gonna like hurt the New York times, bottom line. It's like a threat to all of our health. Like quite literally, you know, I see these things as being very, very connected. So when I see people gleefully celebrating like the fake news of the New York times, I'm like juva better alternative right now, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:42:23       Right. That's what I'm thinking. Not you, but no. Yeah, no, I agree. I don't understand why anyone would celebrate that. Think it falls into what we were talking about before that it's an easily digestible ideology that you can just subscribe to. It's a conglomeration of preformed opinions and you lock in. You start saying fake news, and this is. It's also, it's exacerbated by this situation that we find ourselves in where people aren't really buying newspapers anymore. You have to get people to subscribe. I subscribe to several on my phone and on my computer and that's how I digest things now or an ipad. When you, you think about what they have to do to get those clicks and you see these weird look, it is not a knock on forbes. I think forbes is an excellent periodical. They're great. They, they, they write some really important stuff, but almost every month they will write this super click baity thing about cell phones.

Speaker 1:          01:43:21       Like it comes with a nasty surprise. The new galaxy s 10 has a nasty surprise and it's so unimaginative. Yes. Yes. Look, see if you can find how many nasty surprise articles about iphones and I've about video games and stuff a lot too. Did they have like a contributor network that people are just allowed to write articles on? Ah, they allow post used to have that too. Yeah. That fucking stuff is so dangerous because as soon as people lose trust that you are unbiased and you're giving them an objective perspective on exactly what's going on, as soon as that mean, it might be nothing when it comes to galaxy s tens or whatever the fuck they're talking about. This has a nasty surprise, but. But it, it flavors your perspective on news of course. And these people are fighting for their life. Journalists and people in contributors to these websites and news and newspapers are fighting for their life because everything is dropping off.

Speaker 1:          01:44:19       The revenues are down, the revenues are. And then like what's what takes their place? What took place? Bloggers, who's, who's looking at them? Are you sure that they have journalistic ethics and standards that are like what we would expect from? They don't. They know, right? They don't have to. And this brings you to the end from ars info wars thing, right? He, if he's a journalist, he's definitely not a journalist, but this is, but this is what people are fighting about. This is. This is the whole shebang. Like if, if some of that news that you're getting in these traditional venues is fake, it is dangerous. If any of it is click baity. If any of it is deceptive and agree with you more, it's fucking dangerous. Especially because we have a president who attacks the presses, the member like clinton. I forget the context we're operating.

Speaker 1:          01:45:09       Yes. You know, we have trump calling us the enemy of the people so crazy. The lack of understanding of views it insane. Yeah, for sure. There were easy to drive insane though. let's be honest. There's a lot of dummies out there that's part of the problem. It's just, it's so easy to prod a certain group and they're like, I'm done. I'm going to do something about this. This is, this is the danger, this is what you have to worry about. The people that they, and again, they're signaling to their signaling to the far right, they're signaling to those people. I know a lot of people like that. Not that would shoot people, but I know a lot of people that are signalers that like far right signaler, so like they'll see things and I've. I've talked to people that I hope trump wins because we've got to put a stop to all this nonsense with the nonsense.

Speaker 1:          01:45:53       It's progressive nonsense. The idea socialist like bernie sanders going to come along and take all your money. We're struggling hard working americans. We've got to put America first. Put America first. It's just lack of understanding about the complexity of the entire landscape, the entire landscape in terms of economics, entire landscape in terms of international politics, all of it. All the above the war machine into the, the, the lack of understanding about the military industrial complex and the influence that it has. The lack of understanding about the bankers, about how few people went to jail after the fucking crazy economic collapse that we just recovered. From what I mean, if you view, you've seen inside job, you seen that documentary. It's an amazing documentary, but it's all about the financial collapse. Pulled that up, find out, uh, I watched it. It's from 2000, I want to say 10:11. But it's so sobering

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       when you have this guy who's an economics of real, true economics expert questioning these people who in many cases they're a economics professors at major universities who give advice. Okay. Two thousand 10. I was right. Charles ferguson. That was a gentleman. He did a good job. I know. It's so sad. He's a good guy. I met him, but he's forever. Team America is one of the greatest movies of all time. That ideology should roll. Yes. Yeah. And you know what I love about it more than anything, the whole idea that actors have to save the world because I just think is so brilliant that I inadvertently saw that movie with my dad and my grandfather and I will never forget the puppet sex scene watching that today. That oh, rIght next to your desk and you know you should they ever make that movie. Do you know what I made a mistake of doing yesterday?

Speaker 3:          01:47:47       I watch ace ventura pet detective with my eight year old and my 10 year old since they came out with a good still. I didn't realize how transphobic that fucking movie is alert. The whole premise is that there was an ace ventura pet detective. I got a spoiler it myself because I forgot the Whole premise was wet. This guy steals a dolphin and when he steals a dolphin, ace ventura fines because he's a pet detective, finds a tiny ruby that's at the bottom of this dolphin tank that is missing from a miami dolphins ring. And he finds out through this exhaustive search that the one guy who he couldn't account for his ring was a kicker who fucked up the world series or the superbowl rather. So this suit, this guy, this guy that they found out is Sean Young in the movie who's gorgeous. And then in the movie can take that down please.

Speaker 3:          01:48:49       So in the movie at the end of it, the reveal is that Sean Young is really this football player who wants to get back at dan marino because dan murray, he's Go psycho because the world hates him because he blew the kick. So he's a guy pretending to be a woman and ace ventura made out with them. And just like everyone saw the cops are throwing up. Everyone's throwing up on or off. it's off the charts. At the end he pulls her top off and shows and she has breasts. He was like trying to show that she didn't really abreast and she did. and he's like, well, anybody can get those and an afternoon, but what about this? And he pulls her pants down and then he goes by and then everybody sees her and she's got her legs together so you can't see your penis. And then from behind you see her junk is pressed up against her butt cheeks because she's tucked her penis and her vagina.

Speaker 3:          01:49:38       So the cops all start throwing up. And then cops started cleaning cops that made out with her and start cleaning their mouth off. They start chewing giant wad there. That's her scene. So watch all the cops see that. And he points to the fact that sean, you look, they all start throwing up. Look, everyone's throwing up. This is dan marino's throwing up. See how he's cleaning his mouth because he, he made out with her tone loke the dolphins freaking out. Everyone's freaking out. It is so insanely transformed. So what the left would say is the reason that they're right is that a movie like this won't get made anymore. And isn't that a good thing? Maybe should they pull it? Shouldn't. Should it be illegal to have that on itunes? Of course not. Oh, maybe someone on the left might disagree with you right now.

Speaker 3:          01:50:24       You transphobic for defending this horrible cisgendered heteronormative shit movie that's horrible. And what's crazy, and I guess this is a great thing. I mean the remodelization project is working because when I saw that, I'm sure is. I don't know. What year did that come out? 90 five for. Okay. So when I saw that as a, I don't know, I was born in 84. I can't do math. I want to say [inaudible] 93. I want to say it was before I came to hollywood. When I saw that movie I was 10. Transphobia was not a thing. No, no, it is the thing. That's good. Well that's good about when things are changing so rapidly, but the question is where are the lines being drawn and is the overton window being shrunk too small? How do you feel about them pulling the dukes of hazzard off the air for the flag?

Speaker 3:          01:51:14       I don't know about that. You didn't know about that? No, they pulled the dukes of hazard. You understand? Do you understand how many of these there are so many. Yeah, so no, I don't know that one. What's that one? This one. They yanked the dukes of hazzard off television forever because the confederate flag was on the roof of the generally did not follow this. Didn't know that. You cannot watch the news a hazard anymore. You cannot watch it. It's not on television anymore. It used to be on tv land all the time. Can you just get it? Fuck no, no chance. They're not going to show that god damn awful flag. We have a poster in the bathroom over there of leonard skinner from like 1970 something and they have a giant janis joplin. I thought in the bathroom. The other bathroom. Who? Janis joplin.

Speaker 3:          01:51:58       Oh, That's the other bathroom. Yeah, there's different like. Yeah, that's great one. That's her mug shot. I love it. Yeah, that's right. Um, but the, the leonard scared one, they have a giant confederate flag on stage. Huge. Enormous in the background that was there like southern pride, this idea of southern pride. It was okay to have that flag. I'm basically for trying to, when it comes to the realm of art and movies and books, leave it alone. Try to leave It alone as much as possible. It's generally a very good strategy. I agree. I don't want to be in the book banning movie banning tv, banning business or editing. They tried to mobile. They, I think they did successfully at least in some venues, edit a tom sawyer and huck finn because the n word was used prolifically,

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       you know? I mean the guy's name was nigger jim. That was the name in the book because that's how people talk back then and I think we need to keep that stuff as a time capsule to show how racism.

Speaker 4:          01:53:04       Yes, yes. It's important to show the progress like ace ventura, like, like for trans people, keep him for history for trans people and it's amazing that no one's ever brought this up. I mean, I feel like this is something that's never been discussed from you. Joe rogan about the implant. I got shit to do. I got, I got jokes. Right, but this is. You got an Israel trip that I'm planning and are, what are you doing to me, mary, you're not dragging. You want to take you on an amazing trip and then we're going to go to the west bank and you're gonna see all this stuff and you're going to come away with loving certain parts of it and not liking certain parts of it and you're going to realize it's a country just like any other country, but it is a democracy and it's trying to do what's best in a really rough neighborhood and we'll go like, I want you to see what the occupation looks like. Like I think that's something that's really important to see to get a full picture of it.

Speaker 1:          01:53:59       I think you're probably right. I think it is an important thing for people to see. Um, I think there's a lot of parts of the world that I need to see to really get a grasp. Where do you want to go? Where you going next in the world? You travel a lot. Yes. I don't know. I mean, my family and I, we do a european vacation trip, but that doesn't really count. We just lounge. It's just fun. I went to Thailand last year. That was fascinating. Cool. Thailand was fascinating because that was kind of a vacation trip too, but that's such a uniQue culture because Thailand is run by the king or even criticize the king. You're, you're fucked. Like you're in real trouble. And his is everywhere. Everywhere. There's pictures of him in the throne like wearing like super nice clothes and look good, but the people are so kind.

Speaker 1:          01:54:45       they're so friendly and they're always smiling and they have, you know, there's a lot of people that you'll run into that have very little yet. They don't seem to be having a problem with that. They wear flip flops. You're on the highway. There's three people on a motorcycle is a baby in a basket and I'm not bullshitting. No helmet. and then friend that just went to Thailand, but the people are so nice. They're so nice. They're so kind. It's so unusual. And you know, me and my famIly, we had. We always, whenever we go somewhere, we always have this real long conversations about like what was interesting about it for you? Like what, what did you think, like your kids? Eight and 10, the young ones and I have a 22 year old to all girls holla and from for girls blue jeans, but the, the, the, what's fascinating to me about it is, well first of all I love exposing these little people to different parts of the world so they get to see like what this is like, you know, like here we are, show them on the map.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       This is America, we're over here. but when the fucking 15 hours to get here a plane that goes 500 plus miles an hour, it's crazy. And just to realize like human beings are the same but different. We're the same everywhere, but there's a different way. We choose to interact with each other and one of the things that happens is we fall into their way. When we go there. Like if we go to Italy, we say razzi, I try to, you try to start learning. We'll just start trying to learn. Some of the worDs that people use in their culture and then, oh, I forgot how you say it, cups, zoom crop. I think that's how you said it's like hello and good morning and but they all say that and eveRyone makes a lotus flower with their hands. It's so common. Everywhere you go, people greet you and they do thIs and it's such a warm, friendly, peaceful way of greeting each other.

Speaker 1:          01:56:39       And so one of the things that we talked about it, I was like, you know, everybody's like way more friendly and like greeting and this thing about clapping their hands together and they all agree to do it and everyone can sort of. It's like this unique pattern that people can fall into and people fall into all sorts of patterns. They fall into like really aggressive patterns of honking at people on the road and driving real fast and then they fall into these peaceful patterns and some of it's dictated by culture. Some of It's dictated by climate. Some of it is dictated by the economic situation in the world they're in, but it's such a weird trip to go to different places and see like, okay, yeah, if I lived over here, this is how I'd rocket, I'd be wearing flip flops and shorts and I'd get around this way and this is the kind of food that I would eat.

Speaker 1:          01:57:23       And real spicy because you know, you kind of have to have those spices actually protect against bacteria because they're there. They're actually antIbacterial. Was the food grade fucking amazing. We took some court, we took classes, we learned how to cook over there. Yeah, it was amazing. It was amazing. But my kid got lit up by bugs. Whew. There's a thing called tsetse flies. I think that's what they're called. I forget what they're called, but my youngest had a horrible allergic reaction to some of the bugs over there get. And you know, you think like, okay, like, what about, uh, you know, there's, there's fucking diseases that kill people. Malaria kills. Malaria has killed more people than anything ever. Like more people have died from malaria than anything. Oh, I know. Yeah, well that's why gates made its. Yeah, totally. Yeah, and so you go over there like we were going to go to africa is one of the things that we're going to go to, But I'm not giving my fucking eight year old malaria shots. Just know just like it's health, getting really bad dreams. I've had some friends that dave foley who was like the sweetest guy on the planet earth. He was from kids in the hall, was on news radio with me. Dave foley was on malaria medication because he was going to visit his kids in Egypt so we have to take this stuff and he was drinking, you're not supposed to drink on it. And

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       he. He was just going crazy. He doesn't even remember it. He was going crazy. Taking reporters a microphone or as a tape recorder away and put it in a drink. It was like losing his marbles. Like I had to protect him yelling at a guy like crowd. I'm like calm down. Meanwhile the sweetest, kindest, nicest guy you would ever meet. And meanwhile he was like super aggro, was crazy. It didn't make any sense. And it's the medication. He just had a horrible reaction. I have other friends that had just like horrific waking up, soaked in sweat, evil, nightmares, demons chasing them like fuck this medication. This is too much man. But. But my point is, yeah, I'd be down to go to Israel. I'd be good. I think I need to go to open to that part of the world. No, I want to go to giza too.

Speaker 3:          01:59:29       That's the other place I really need to go to. I've been obsessed with the pyramid since I was a little kid. Can be one trip. All right, I'm on it. All right, done. Let's do it. And you can set up a debate for me and I'm in for that to go. No, no. Go pee. Go pee. Go pee. I don't know if I'm setting up a few debates. I don't know if I can set that one up. That one seems problematic. No, she's hilarious. She's going to drag me to Israel. She's a powerful lady though, right? Scott? She's got some, some horsepower behind our opinions.

Speaker 6:          02:00:06       Are you going to come with us?

Speaker 3:          02:00:10       Got it. You got to take pictures, man. You're a professional photographer at this camera for. Yeah. Yeah. Um, would you feel nervous? Where would you feel more nervous going to giza are going to gaza.

Speaker 6:          02:00:23       Gaza, right? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:00:25       Oh, shit could pop off at any minute. You just don't want to be there when it all goes sour.

Speaker 6:          02:00:30       Yeah. A friend of my dad in the eighties, he was a, he was on this weird belief to beirut and he was being tracked. He found out once he got back, he met ronald reagan when he met president reagan. He said, it's nice to meet you. We've been following you. And he's like, excuse, excuse me, good following me. So yeah, we found out there was like a threat like after you take, but I think he fainted on the spot or something like that. There was a threat. Yeah. You're just going to deliver a hot dog. His name is hot dog hair. He was trying to help the troops and stuff. And what was the threat? They were trying to kill them. Jesus delivered hot dog at one point, uh, a car pull up next to him. And I guy with a gun, how to like rep to his head and that the cab got the cab driver. Thankfully. No, it was happening like took off and he didn't die. Why would they were gonna kill him just for delivering high. Don't remember the exact situation. Like they weren't happy. He was over there trying to help someone do shit. Yeah, I believe that's how it went down. Yeah. Fuck

Speaker 3:          02:01:28       yeah. There's spots in the world that are just so fucked up. Like you don't want to go because you, you, you hear and you're like, I don't want to get caught up in that. I don't want to get caught up in that one. I could just stay burbank.

Speaker 1:          02:01:42       Why would I go and get caught up in that? But then there's other parts. He goes, man, for your own edification, you should probably go just to understand what it's like. Did you hear about those ladies that were killed in Morocco? Hey, you're back. Um, you shut that door. That's okay. We're just talking about going to dangerous places and it's probably a good idea. But you get scared and you know for the most part you probably shouldn't be scared, but sometimes you should. And we were just talking about those women that were killed in Morocco, those norwegian hikers, they were from where they're from, Norway or Denmark, I forget. They were there hiking and morocco's to women and they were killed by these. But one was just kidding Australia, 20 year old israeli good. The one that killed people that were doing it because of the United States involvement in Syria and they cut their heads off and phone camera and they put it on the internet and I watched it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:34       You watched it. So why would you watch that? You don't want it. Because I was reading the story and the video was there and I just clicked it and I shouldn't have. And just to see it. It's just part of me wants to know that people like that exist. They exist. I know they exist, but I don't want it to be an abstract. You know what? I watched the danny pearl video. I've never watched another video like that again. Yeah, I saw that one too. I've seen quite a few of them now you need to know, I don't want to go there, you know, I mean, it's not worth it to go to a place where that's happening, but you need to know that that's happening, right? In order to have a realistic perspective on world events, you need to know what it is at the worst end of the spectrum. Like what is, what is the, what are the consequences for rabbit ideologies?

Speaker 2:          02:03:23       well, I've thought about that with like what we decide to show and not show after mass shootings here, you know, like um, I was in pittsburgh like right after and I was because I knew the rabbi who was doing some of the cleanup and

Speaker 1:          02:03:39       because of religious reasons and that you were, you, your bat mitzvah was there. That is sO crazy.

Speaker 2:          02:03:45       Yeah. My dad knew six of the people who were murdered and um, but like, it was really crazy to me how locked down. It wasn't like you couldn't take it. I was there with a photographer and you couldn't take any pictures at all of anything, you know? And there's a real lockdown on showing people Because you don't want to terrIfy people, but I've wondered would it prick people's consciousness about the reality of what gun violence looks like? You know, like the carnage, like the people that I know that saad said it looked like a war zone and would that change public policy and would that be a posItive thing or would we just become numb to it? Like we become numb to everything else?

Speaker 1:          02:04:29       No, no, it's a very good question. I, I'm never in favor of suppressing inflammation. even horrific information. Um, I was a big critic of that during the bush administration when they passed laws on whether or not you're allowed to show actual coffins, just coffins. You weren't allowed to show coffIns being flown back. I felt like that was, that's a disgrace. That's, I mean, you should, if you, if, if we're going to consider whether or not we want to go to war, we should be able to understand the real consequences. And one of the best ways is to not just get information in terms of text. Text is very difficult for you to conceptualize, but when you would, seeing american flags covering coffins, when you're seeing hundreds of them and you realize these are your neighbors, these are your neighbors children's, this is, this is people that you, you know, and they're dyIng over there and you can't really. You can't wrap your head around why they're doing it and whether or not it's right, whether or not we should have been there and then whether or not they're actually were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, whether or not we're in the business of nation building, whether or not ron paul is right, whether or not other people are right. Well who's right, like the only way we're really going to get a clear picture is to see a picture. To have an actual

Speaker 2:          02:05:49       picture. Yeah. Well that's why I've thought about this a lot because rIght now I think in most american's minds it's like the shooting happens. Then it becomes a hashtag, then it becomes a tee shirt. Then it becomes a memorial thing, a memorial concert. I mean it's like actually sickening like the the choreography of it and I think what's lost is what it looks like and this rabbi in pittsburgh who is really amazing, describe to me what he saw and I'll never forget just the description of what he told me and I wondered. I've wondered a lot in the wake of that and I'll think about it with the next shooting happens. Would that have made a difference at all in terms of waking people up?

Speaker 1:          02:06:28       What's fucked up as you said, when the shooting happens, that's what's fucked when we know it will happen. We know a lot, but yeah. Yeah. Why?

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       Why? Because because there are a lot of guns in this country and people have access to those guns who are not only mentally unwell. Sometimes they're just evil and they want to kill people and they want to be famous. I mean for a million reasons, but the fact that we're living in a culture that seems to worship people's freedom to own those weapons more than human life seems crazy to me. It really does.

Speaker 1:          02:07:09       I get what you're saying. The argument against that would be this, look, look, the real crazies believed that these things are happening and that they're happening because of the fact that government wants to take away our guns. This is the real crazies. Explain that. I'm not sure I followed that. They are making these people do these things. The government that the worst worst aspects of our society, whatever, fill the blank with whatever left wing conspiracy that you know, whatever person, whatever, boogeyman, george soros, whatever the fuck the boogie man is that the whatever boogeyman or book or cabal of boogie people that they are somehow or another either using like manchurian candidate type influence, whatever the fuck they're doing, they're getting people to do this and then even creating false flags where these things didn't happen so they can take away guns. This is the.

Speaker 1:          02:08:06       I mean this is exactly what it is. You're right. It is. It is. It is dumb, but it's real. It's real. In terms of the influence that it has, that people actually do believe that there are these false flag events that they're designing to to get your guns, that people are training people to go out and kill a bunch of people so that they can take away your guns, so it makes them more rabid about their support of the second amendment and they, they, they feel like they're being attacked on all sides. have you looked very recently? Last week? The mindset of the conspiracy thinker is totally fascinating to me. It is. A midwest is actually just as good or even better. he runs medibank. He's a fascinating guy. I used to do the show. I did the show for awhile on scifi. I called joe Rogan questions everything, and one of the things that we went into was a why people believe in chem trails, why people believe that the heat of jet engines, which causes these artificial clouds when it interacts with condensation, the atmosphere and creates, you know, creates artificial clouds.

Speaker 1:          02:09:10       You see called trails. Some people believe that these are, that someone's spraying something and that this weather control from these commercial jets that they're somehow though is this gigantic conspiracy of all these people involved and that this is in some way, uh, they're, they're either doing weather control or they're controlling us or mind control. It depends on who you ask. And that may kind of really interesting way of discussing it. And one of the things that he said is this is like the training wheels for conspiracy theory because you see it in the sky. Let's look. There it is. I don't remember that anymore. There's photographs from world war ii where you can see from the 19 forties, you could see contrails in the sky that looked just like the ones up here, but people will say, I don't remember those when we were kids people.

Speaker 1:          02:09:55       Oh yeah, yeah, I don't. And then it starts fueling this paranoid idea that there's this program going on. And then there are real programs that the government is CoNsideriNg to combat global warming. Where they talked about thIs in the, in the seventies and the eighties. They talked about reflective particles in the atmosphere. I think they were when they were concerned that the ozone layer was meant mammals the eighties probably probably later than that, but even more recently they've talked about suspending reflective particles in the atmosphere to protect it, but it'd be very differeNt, but why do people believe conspiracy theories? what is it in the nature of certain people that when I'm just so fascinated bY it. That's a good question. That's what I was going to ask you. What do you. When you see it from the outside, when you see something like a, like The most horrific ones, like sandy hook, sandy hook being a false flag, what would be the motivation for someone saying that? What would be the Motivation?

Speaker 2:          02:10:54       The only thing I can. I mean the most plausible I guess would be capturing an audience, like getting people to believe in you is some sier behind the veil.

Speaker 1:          02:11:07       Yeah, but that's only the people that are projecting this in terms of the media. Alex jones, like why does he say that was my question is why do other people think it? Why do they look for it? Not, not a person?

Speaker 2:          02:11:19       No, I think that's. I think the reason people look to conspiracy theories is that the world is deeply chaotic and seems to lack a logic and people are desperate for a system of understanding the world and conspiracy theories often seem to like offer a very, very actually like an incredibly simplistic explanation, which is there's this secret fit. Like if there's always a secret thing that is a plan that the public doesn't know about. General mills.

Speaker 1:          02:11:55       The thing is that no one really is at the wheel.

Speaker 2:          02:11:57       Yeah. Yeah. The real thing is that, I mean, haven't we learned that from the trump presidency? Right. Like institutions are just made up with people like they can fall apart if the people that take them over are irresponsible, crazy, venal, narcissistic. Everything that we're seeing in the trump administration will also like people. But isn't that kind of. It's weirdly. I mean it's both terrifying, but also comforting. I think like if it's people, if it's just people, people can also change it. It's not like there's a secret hand that we need to get to just, okay, what's the solution? Elect better people.

Speaker 1:          02:12:41       That's the hopeful part. We think that this such as it is, this constant conflict, this social conflict that we're involved in right now, the woke left and the outright and all this jazz, that there's the boiling of it right now will eventually boiled down to something more rational because if it seems like if you. If you read steven pinker's work and people that study violence and in danger and society over the course of history that we're. We're certainly on an upward trend. Even though data shows us all the data shows that no one's denying that there are some awful aspects to our culture today in society and crime and violence and fill in the blank disparity and yes, all those things exist, but there's more understanding of that is more awareness of that and there's certainly a safer, safer world today than was 100, 200 years ago. In terms of like your own.

Speaker 2:          02:13:34       Well, just think about my life like I am a woman who can walk down the street of almost any american city with all the privileges that I have granted, but unharmed. Yes. That's a miracle in human history. It is. Like there's one day I was at the beach and I was like, wow, I'm just sitting here in a bathing suit. No one's coming up to me. No one's harassing me. How many parts of the world could I do that in? you know, like I, I try and keep that in mind when I'm falling into despair about where we are as a country where I'm like, oh, actually in a lot of ways it's still like the best thing of the worst things. It's the best thing in history so far. It's certainly for women, so I try and kind of keep that in mind when I'm losing myself to feelings, to fears that things are going to get worse before they get better, which is what I think.

Speaker 1:          02:14:24       I, I have all daughters and I have friends that are women and I have a lot of friends that are women in the world of standup comedy and I oftentimes see misogynist shit online that shocks me and one of the things that shocked me was there's a guy that I follow and he was talking about how his wife a thread on twitter, well thought out, very smart guy. He's a lawyer and I was talking about how his wife's gas tank is always empty, so every time he gets into his wife's car, she's always out of gas. I was like, what the fuck? Why do I always have to get gas for you? And then she explained she doesn't to park to get gas because she gets harassed and it creeps her out and it was like a man will never think about that. Not only men never think about that. The messages he was getting from men calling him a cock making excuse. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, there is

Speaker 2:          02:15:22       I, I mean I, I'm an idiot that I didn't think darkly enough because of course it was going to go there. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:15:28       and he told me direct messages getting directly, it's just people saying all kinds of crazy shit to him because they not only are they in denial that this could be a situation where their mother was in or their wife or their daughter. Maybe they don't have a daughter. Maybe they have a bad relationship with her mother. Maybe they just, they've had so many bat, you know, if a guy has had so many bad interactions with women and he's not very smart and he's just decided that women are evil and you see anything that's like saying, hey guys, maybe we should look at it in terms of like how the woman looks at it. Fuck you. Like that's real. Those guys are real and they're out there. I was at a gas station the other night at 2:00 in the morning. I was coming home from the comedy store and I pulled into this gas station and there was this guy, yeah, that bulletproof thing where this thick glass, the guy's talking to.

Speaker 1:          02:16:15       I'm using my credit card and this guy's trying to use his debit card and I pull in. I get out of my car and I hear yelling and I hear him going, hey bro, relax. You're not a fucking bank teller. A right. He goes, you're taking this job so seriously. You make $10 an hour and the guy says something, there's no money on the cars. Like fuck you. there's $800 on this card. And his friend from the car saying something, he's an I am nervous. Okay, I'm there. Yes, it's 2:00 in the morning and I'm nervous and I'm like fuck. And I'm like, what if this guy turns any of this aggression on me? What if he decides? I mean he's a fucking asshole and he's probably drunk or high or something and it's 2:00 in the morning and it's him and there's another guy in the car and I'm so nervous humiliating the guy who works.

Speaker 1:          02:17:02       Yes, yes. And I'm so nervous that I'm thinking of cutting my pump short. I'm thinking I just don't get a full tank. Just get five bucks and get the fuck outta here. You know, don't run out of gas, but let's just get the fuck out here. We'll get the gas tomorrow during the daylight and I'm a man and I'm looking at these two guys and I'm saying, okay, if some shit goes down, if these guys don't have a weapon, if some shit goes down, I'm gonna. Beat the fuck out of these two guys. Did they look skinny? They look like they don't exercise, but they're aggressive. They're angry, they're stupid. I'm like, god damn it. Like all my spidey senses are going to get out of here. Go get out of here and like an asshole. I decided to stay and pump my gas, but when the the these guys are yelling at each other.

Speaker 1:          02:17:42       I literally went around the front of the car instead of the back way because it was a shorter path for me being exposed to their view. So I'm hiding behind my Truck while I'm filling my tank and I'm a man who could kill these two guys. I honestly thought where this story was going to go is that you were going to go over and tell them to stop. I was thinking of going over there, but I didn't want to get shot and I'm thinking, what if this, some people die now I'm saying no, but also where you can get hit in the head with a pipe thing that you have to worry that you're going to get shot at. Again, it is. It is, but it's not just shot. It's just violence in general and I'm and I'm a martial arts expert so I'm less worried than most men and certainly way less worried than a woman.

Speaker 1:          02:18:29       If I was a woman and I pulled up and I heard that guy go, fuck you make $10 an hour, bro. Fucking relaxed. I'd be like, oh, get me the fuck out of here. I was on fumes though. Raising two daughters made you so much more aware of this stuff? A hundred percent. Yeah, and also just raising babies. Even if there were boys, I realized that people were babies. Now I used to think of people as being in a static state. How old are you? Thirty four. I meet you. I go, oh, 34 year old person. this is a 34 year old person. I didn't meet you in think in the past I would have met you and only thought of you as a 34 year old person. Now I look at everyone as a baby. That's how I process things and it made me way more compassionate, way more understanding and way more patient with people because I now I say, okay, when I meet this asshole at the gas station to clock in the morning, that's berating that guy.

Speaker 1:          02:19:20       Well, why is he will? Because his dad's a fucking piece of shiT. his life probably sucks. He's probably dumb. He's probably been on drugs since he was young. He doesn't have any smart friends. They don't have any money to get gas at 2:00 in the morning. They're making poor life choices. There's a lot wrong here. He doesn't enemy discipline in his life. He's never gone through any sort of trials and tribulations that taught him about things he doesn't, doesn't or didn't receive life lessons. Probably didn't get a good education. Here we are and I might have to kick this guy's ass because it's 2:00 in the morning and he's threatening. He's loud and he's probably going To be allowed to. Other people look at them the wrong way. He's just fucking toxically stupid, but it was a baby. He was a baby at one point in time, so I don't want to go over there.

Speaker 1:          02:19:59       I don't want to. I don't. I don't want to create violence. I'm thinking he's just going to drive away and eventually he did and that poor guy who probably is probably making just a little bit more than $10 an hour is stuck in this fucking cubicle. This little glass box with this asshole berating him at 2:00 in the morning, but that's a baby that I was a baby. My, my, my except not acceptance, but my curiosity was socialism. My real curiosity with any socialist ideas is how do we recognize the fact that some people are dealt the shittiest of shitty hand of cards and that there's entire sections of cities where everyone has a shit hand of cards and some some make it out through basketball and football and sports and rap music and whatever, but that whole spot sucks. The whole spot sucks. The aberrations, the few that make it out.

Speaker 1:          02:20:55       That's not indicative of that. This is a good place and these people just need to pull themselves up by the bootstraps is that some salmon make it up. This crazy waterfall and the grizzly bears don't eat them. It doesn't mean that the waterfall is save for salmon and the salmon to get bitter bunch of pussies. It's, it's this, this is chaos. This the fact that we don't address that and that our civilization just plows on with the same stupid path that we've had for decades. Regardless of the fact that we have an absolute understanding of the complete inequality of the. The real ghettos of our country. Whether it's the south side of chicago or whether it's baltimore or wherever it is, we have a real understanding of this. This isn't, this isn't guesswork. We really know and we don't do a goddamn thing about it.

Speaker 1:          02:21:39       That's what makes me want to embrace some aspects of socialism. The fact that I know it's not fair, it's not fair. Look, I didn't have a Great childhood, but it wasn't bad. I got through. I'm fine. No, he shot me. Nobody raped me. I got through like it could have been way worse and it is way worse for many, many people. So all these pull yourself up by your booTstraps, assholes. The other thing I noticed about them is they're rarely really successful. Like they are rare. They really rarely are these pull yourself up by your bootstraps people. People who have accomplished anything extraordinary. It's just like an idea. It's like it's, it's, it's a, it's a simplistic ideology that they've subscribed to. You should have aoc on. I would love to. We. Her and I have gone back and on twitter. Yeah. That

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       would be really interesting to listen to us. She's so young. I'm so interested in, yeah, she's 28 years old. I mean, that's amazing. The whole thing is amazing. She's just fascinating. You should haVe her own. How about when she was getting a hard time because they found a video like they thought they were going to get her college dancing. Yeah, but you know what? Everyone loved that video, right? The whole narrative that like some random person on tWitter put that video out. right, and the point is they did it because they thought they were going to shame her. TheY're idiots, but how funny is that? They thought it was the most charming thing in the entire world. Anyone who did not love her already fell in love with you. That's what it accomplished. And then her response to that was her doing a little dance. She's a genius. She's a social media genius. The question is, does she do her ideas? Stand up at all will be interesting to hear.

Speaker 3:          02:23:15       Ideas can evolve, but what she has, it's unique and she's real and she seems to be a really good person. She seems to be a good person. Now whether or not I agree with her tax policy, I'm not an economist. I'm a fucking moron. Okay? I don't know anything about economics. I really don't. I mean, you should have her almost like now rather have her on per just. I just want to know about her as a person. For my. My thoughts on politicians is you can hire an economist. You could listen to them. You could talk to them. What we really need is people that have the right idea as far as we're human should go the way we should behave, the way we should treat each other. This, this overwhelming need for community that we all share. We have to. We have to pull this thing together and we have to be.

Speaker 3:          02:24:00       We have to look at each other as a community and that's lacking and the people that are polarizing both on the left and the right want, they don't want to look at it that way. Don't they want to look at people and say, hey, you will never get better like that 16 year old kid. No need to ever forgive him. This kind of crazy talk, whether it's from the right or from the left, is what we really need to stomp out. We need to stop, we need to be nicer to each other. We need to figure out where we don't have time. We're not going to live long. If you're 50 years old and this is your idea of the world, like, fuck man, you're halfway done and you're an. You're an idiot. You're looking at shit completely wrong and you're halfway done with this trip. If everything goes perfect.

Speaker 4:          02:24:40       I know we're like in an antireligious period of the world's history, but like ideas like grace and mercy.

Speaker 3:          02:24:48       Yeah. Would, would, would go a long way in the culture right now. Yes. No, I agree. And even even if it's just. Even if it's really wacky, you know, mindfulness and yoga, even if it's like comes from a sort of fake guru we place in the beginning, which a lot of times it does. It's just people have. I mean, people have deep

Speaker 4:          02:25:11       the religious impulses and that needs to go somewhere and so it's going to politics and doctrinaire politics or it's going to willfulness or it's going to self care and wellness. I mean, all these things are

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       astrology. It's like making a comeback isn't really. Yeah. Every. Are you kidding? Yes. Right? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. What's trOubling signs like? I mean it's like all religious expert like that energy inside of us I think is deeply human and goat needs to go somewhere are really smart guy who told me it doesn't do anything until he contacts his astrologer. Everyone in la has one. Yeah. No, that's not true. Jamie. Jamie does not have one. No. Jamie consults the weed leaves. Yeah. I don't know what that's about, but I do think that people do have thiS desire for a space daddy, a higher power of someone that knows something that knows more than you. Some grand pattern to follow. That leads to harmony. I mean, I tHink everybody sort of has that thing because again, what we're talking about before, we do realize if we are being honeSt that no one's at the wheel, that we wake up, we're almost like we're in a spaceship and we wake up and you know, we were in Hyper sleep and this thing has been flying for millions of years and we're like, who the fuck is flying this?

Speaker 3:          02:26:37       Do we know who's flying? Are you, you're not flying. I'm not flying them. Well, I'm going to, we're going to get together and with a form of group that flies it like, okay, okay, but it still moves. It's still moving while we're trying to figure out who flies it and there's no way to slow it down. There's no breaks in this thing. We, we are in an organic spaceship, we are, we are, and we're flying through infinity. We're spinning a thousand miles an hour and we're going through space and that's real and you're going to die. That's all those things are real. All those things sort of make everything else sort of pale in comparison. The reality of that is so Bizarre and while while we're avoiding those thoughts were concentrating on these very minor differences that we have that are really framed by our teams. You know the team, this team says, you gotta do this, this team says you got to do that.

Speaker 3:          02:27:24       I can tell almost to a. If you tell me you're pro life, I go, you vote republican. Feel everything else about that person. That's crazy. The idea also that you know that you're going to die and yet there are people who are spending their lives hurling pixels at other people and pixels like on twitter. hilarious though. Pixels. I never thought about it that way. That's crazy. This is your one life. Yup. That's how you want to spend it. being mean. Go outside. Seriously, like go outside, but it's so intoxicating and it's so new. That's also the problem with social media and phones in a world in which people live alone and stare down at their flashy screen and worship it like a god. This, these networks gives you, give you a sense of belonging and community. Yes, and it also gives you something to think about if you, uh, you know, I was talking about jamie kilstein earlier were accidental tweeted or

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       texted, jamie used to be but social justice and he was describing how he would go after people and then he would be locked onto his phone all day long, look at the responses and completely addicted to it no matter what he did throughout his day. He was checking his phone every couple minutes and couldn't help that compulsion. That's a lot of people out there that are locked into this. Yes, it is an addiction. I've had to get. I mean, like I had a small period of a few months where I had not really been on twitter. I joined the times. That sort of thing happened to me and then I was like, this is horrible. Like I hate the way this is physically making me feel like I'm nauseous and sweating like, I, I hate this, I can't do this. IT's to be a better way saying something mean to you, oh my god.

Speaker 4:          02:29:10       And then you look at it and you're like, I should say something back like this really intense. And then people, you see them like formulating and like, hey man, what are you doing? I'm in, I'm in the middle. I'm in mortal kombat here. Mortal online to know you, you catch yourself. Like I remember I was at a dinner party once and I was like ta describing some twitter fight I was at and I was like, oh my god, I've become one of those people and I'm, I'm not going to allow myself to be thAt person. But you have to fight it. You do have to fight it and you have to be aware of what it is, you know, like it feels like something you have to pay attention to. Right. But the beauty is that I get to write for the New York times. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:29:48       I'd like to put my energy into that. Yeah. And when you do get criticism from your articles, do you get it in the form of like, what is really scary email today? I get emails, I get tweets, I get everything, everything everyone gets. I get letters in the mail sometimes. Do you want to talk about it? Like what? No, I mean it's. Wait. No, I mean I can. I can. I don't think it's so unusual, like that's part of, you know, I write things that people find provocative. I expect to provoke a reaction. I'm okay with that. And when there are things that are scary, you know, the New York times is really good about monitoring that there's no way I don't like to be in a field that's got getting attacked as an enemy of the people by the president of the United States. We're super excited about that. It's so bizarre. The guy, he's so petty that he calls it like the failing needed, but it's so irresponsible like there. I'm shocked that there has not been more violence perpetrated on members of the press. I'm really, I really am. What do you think happens with him?

Speaker 4:          02:30:57       I don't know who can feed us. I don't know who can beat him. Who do you think can beat him? That's good question. Don't know. Hillary can't. I'm so worried. I'm so worried. She's going to run again. She's going to muscle her way to the top. I don't know who can beat him right now and I'm, I'm, I don't know. Why do you think that the question right? If things keep going further and further south. What

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       about someone who is a centrist democrat? Doesn't that make more sense that someone who's gonna who's a rational person who's on the right is going to look at this person who's maybe economically conservative but socially liberal and say this is really where I'm leaning towards one on the far left and like on, on an identity politics platform scares me. Yeah. That's not going to work well, could it? Because I don't know because trump's whole thing was screw the center. I Just need to make my base go ape shit crazy for me, but they're still apeshit crazy and no matter what he does and I'm worried that the left that the democrats are going to try and replicate that strategy and be like, we just need to make our base go ape shit crazy rather than running someone that can win the center. I see where You're going, but I think that this is maybe my liberal bias, but I think that people on the left wouldn't fall for that the same way people in the right word.

Speaker 3:          02:32:12       I don't think people on the left who saw someone who went ape shit full woke far left. I think there's a lot of people in the center and be like, well, I'm going to just get a vote. Libertarian man. I'm going to vote for Gary Johnson or some shit. but okay, so who's in right now? So we have kamala, kirsten gillibrand, whole month's dress, monster ds ideas. Well, when she was 22 she had. She's in a solid toady. What does that mean? She is toady. I think that I use that word correctly. Jamie, can you check with toady means like towing the line? Is that what it means? No, I think it's like a t o a d I e. What does that mean? I think it means, and I think it means

Speaker 7:          02:32:56       there you go.

Speaker 3:          02:32:59       Toady definition of tony's, a person, planners or defers to others. Can I kind of self serving reasons a sycophant. So she's in assad, sycophants that what you're saying? Yeah, that's true. That's

Speaker 3:          02:33:13       known about her. Like what did she say? That I don't. I don't remember the details I've read it should say that before we say that about or we should probably read it rather well. I have read it. Normally we should write. Oh, okay. Just so we know what she said. Look, I really enjoyed talking to her. I like her a lot. Are you serious? Yeah. Like talking to her. A lot of talking to her. I don't know about. I think she's like the mother lode of bad ideas. Whoa. I'm pretty positive about that. especially on the side, but maybe I'm wrong. I don't think I'm wrong. Well, my take on her was that I think as a person who's coming from the left who is also a veteran and is very articulate and sensible and a woman, and in talking to her and we didn't get into a sod or any of those things, but talking to her about what she feels is wrong with the current administration and the way things are running in a direction she thinks things could go in, sheds a very promising ideas. I don't. I didn't know about this, doesn't she? also. Did she ever apologize for believing in conversion therapy for? I didn't even know she believed in conversion therapy. Am I crazy? Is that real? I'm almost positive. This is real. I think her father ran a center therapy. You're talking about gay? Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:34:29       No. Oh, I didn't know that. I never heard that. I did hear something about when she was very young. She was like 22. She had said something about gay marriage and civil unions. If she apologized for it and said that she evolved. She reveals she met assad In Syria without informing top democrats. She's. She said she went on a fact finding mission in supportive piece for syrian people, but characterize us backed rebels' as terrorists.

Speaker 3:          02:34:57       yeah. She's.

Speaker 8:          02:35:00       I mean,

Speaker 3:          02:35:01       I can keep looking, but I just. I'm telling me it's time to research everything all at the same time. I can come back on When I do, but let's, let's. We can do this another time, but what, who do you think stands out for you as someone that would make a good president? She wants touted working for an anti gay group that, that conversion therapy. Anyway, she wants touted working for an anti. She worked for an anti gay group. She worked for them like she had a job there, you know, I'm worried as a person who's been called. All right adjacent worry about labels. No, I understand, but you know what I mean? Rep tulsi gabbard in the early two thousands touted working for her father's anti gay organization which mobilized to pass a measure against same sex marriage in Hawaii and perverted and promoted controversial conversion therapy. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:35:47       Fyi. Conversion therapies. The weirdest shit of all time. There was a an article that I read about, they were. They were manipulating pleasure. It turned out it's. I start, I started reading it from a study on rats. They did this thing with rats where they provided. They've figured out a way to give rats orgasms.

Speaker 3:          02:36:11       I figured out a way to jazz up the pleasure center of the brain and they would do anything to do it. They would, they would shock, they would run up, pass an area that shocked them, like they do do anything to get to this area where they could have these orgasms and they would have them up to 2000 times a day. They wOuld just not just all day long and in reading male and female rats, rats, just just, just, just rats trying to come. And so when I was a love that we're in our three talking about rat orgasms. Oh, it's amazing studies. Amazing. Well tHis. Sorry folks.

Speaker 1:          02:36:51       Mr. Mrs. Weiss time to turn away. They did it with a gay man while they were doing this. This is in the 19 seventies. There's a couple different studies that they did, but one of them they did with this gay guy where they tried to stimulate certain parts of his brain while they were showing him heterosexual porn and they were trying to convert him into being heterosexual and apparently they had some meager amount of success with this where he engaged in sexual relationships with women and and apparently even enjoyed it and they did something to the literally stimulate a part of his brain that would excite arousal and tried to connect that with with heterosexual porn and made him orgasm, made him masturbate to orgasm while they were doing this and showing him straight porn and the idea was they were going to reprogram his mind.

Speaker 1:          02:37:47       HOw'd that work out? It didn't, but It did. It did in terms of short term, but it didn't mean it must have been just massively confused. Obviously sexuality is not just about what makes you have an orgasm. No, it's not. It's also incredibly. It's incredibly complex and one of the things that happens is you get. You can have gay experiences when you're young. If someone does something to you in imprints upon you arousal at a young age with, with gay experiences, sometimes even heterosexual men will get aroused by certain gay images and gay things because of their past because of that, like chris,

Speaker 4:          02:38:27       but that we're all on a spectrum of sexuality and

Speaker 1:          02:38:33       yes, I think so for sure. We all certainly are, but it's also speculative. How much of that spectrum is influenced by your environment versus your jeans and you know, and this is very taboo for some people discuss even though it's really fascinating. Human sexuality is incredibly fascinating and there's, there's some major taboo areas of exploration and when you start looking at like what makes a person gay or straight, whether it's nature or nurture, whether it's a combination of those things where if someone's just radically gay from the room or whether someone's radically straight from the womb, these, these studies where they were trying to, they were trying to turn someone with science and they were trying to turn someone straight. It's, it's, uh, it's very. You couldn't do it today. You'd never be able to do it today in America. Yeah, I believe it was 71. They did it. I'll look it up. I'll send it to you. It's crazy. It's crazy. Widely criticized, but heavily studied. The woman, they did it to a woman to and they. They stuck these. This woman had a problem with pain killers and so they figured out a way to wire her brain. Is this like electric shock therapy? These fucking dental drills,

Speaker 4:          02:39:44       but only on their brains can do whatever they wanted to get high. WHen does this. Now's the time we break out the elan musk. We'd. OH my god. That was crazy. I watched every minute of it was stop thing. We drank whiskey for two hours for when I say crazy, I mean like an amazing get like journalistically. Yeah, it was awesome. No

Speaker 1:          02:40:07       is really cool and I have to thank some of his friends that I'm friends with that convinced him to do that. Yeah, that was a fascinating conversation. I thought it was nothing. I thought so. We smoked a little pot. I didn't. I literally didn't think of it. Amy thing he does. It's fascinating. That's what. Why aren't really wanted to talk to him about what his thought process like, like what's going on. I know something different is going on in his head. Right? You know, you ever talked to someone where you know, because I have children and I do like to think of people's babies that become, you know, what they are, see them in front of me right now and this constant state of evolution. But sometimes I'll run into someone that's depressingly stupid where I realized like, god damn, this guy's got a nine volt brain. They just do. Some people just do it. No one wants to admit that. And we're not talking about mental retardation or any sort of a disease down syndrome or something like that. We're talking about people that are just toxic, stupid and they do exist. Just like some people have big noses, some people have little noses.

Speaker 3:          02:41:09       So when you were talking to elon musk, did you get the sense that you were talking to like a genius? What did it feel like? I'm a chimp champion here. That firstly. Yeah. I'm not exactly what was going to say I am that toxically stupid person talking to this guy really wants to create gigantic power stations in Australia to fix their grid and wants to shoot fucking rockets into space and they literally let them drill under la. They're like, go ahead. What are you going to do? We're going to drill holes. God, people are completely fascinated by him and they would have watched you. They would have watched like a silent movie with you and him for two hours and millions of people would have watched that. I don't know about that. No, I didn't want to hear him talk for sure, but I'm saying like anything he does, it's completely fascinating to people. Well, he's

Speaker 1:          02:41:52       gitelman super genius. Legitimate, like when he's not full of shit is that. That is his thought process is extraordinary, but one of the things that was really clear from talking to him was that it's uncomfortable that his whole life it's been this tornado of ideas is going against his head and he's like, you wouldn't want to be me. She's like, what do you mean man? You know, he's like, it never shuts off, you know, like, oh, But he wasn't, he wasn't, woe Is me. He was being factual and he was probably, it's probably like, you know, some people have a ringing in their ears. They have tinnitus, rock concerts, too many. I think he's got a ringing of ideas. So while you and I are having this conversation, I don't have a fucking

Speaker 3:          02:42:39       anything else going on in my head. There's nothing, there's nothing else back there. It's just you and I talking and there's no fucking grand plans. I think he's like remapping civilization and trying to make a better yacht. I'm thinking I want a burger. That's what I'm thinking.

Speaker 1:          02:42:56       He's, he's just, you know, just like shaquille o'neal is eight feet tall and some people are four feet tall. You know, some people just have a brain. I mean there's no, there's no level playing field. It comes to

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       anything politik performance or, or mental performance. Parents are, like you were talking about before, like I won the lottery when it comes to that. I'm so aware of that and everything in my life that made everything possible. Well, that is the real, the only saving grace of the concept of white privilege is that we do have to recognize that some people got a really good deal and some people got a really terrible deal, but the only reason why white privileges even something to consider Is that racism is real. That white privilege is not if the world was barry weiss or kinds of privilege. Right? But what I was going to say is if the world was people like you or people like jamie, we would never have to worry about racism because it wouldn't even be a consideration. Jamie's on black twitter every day. Love jamie.

Speaker 3:          02:43:59       What are you doing over there? it's just been a producer working. Um, but you know what I'm saying? like if, if it was no racism, that concept would be totally irrelevant. And what we would be concentrating on is, you know, who's making the best buildings? Who's making the best music? What, what, what were the contributions to culture we wouldn't care about if they were coming from asian people or west indian people, we wouldn't care, but I think the contribution of the left to make people recognize dunno, privilege of all kinds, that's useful. It's actually useful to think about that. What is not useful is to say because you were x, y, or z thing, therefore you're out. Yes. Therefore you have no stake and therefore in fact you have sort of less of a claim on truth and morality. I'm sure you're aware of what happened recently with the woman from cnn who was on patriot

Speaker 1:          02:44:52       radio. She was amazing. She accused an african american gentleman who she didn't do her research. She instead of arguing the idea or discussing these ideas and she said, because of your white privilege, it's blinding you. And he was like, he, he, he gave her rope to, you know, to me like as a person does jujitsu. He lIke gave her a room. He gave her room and she went right into the choke. she has sank the choke in herself. She explained it even further and he said, I hate to break it to you, but I'm black and she must have just felt her whole life. All of our Intellectual credibility just go fucking blush flushed down the toilet like, oh my god, you just got exposed and this is what people love about preposterous thinking. It's preposterous thinking. If it's given enough time, it's eventually gonna slam into a wall and that's what we saw. We saw a truck with a fucking brick on the accelerator, just slammed right into the wall because she thought she had a path that you couldn't stop and this is the path. It's like if you're playing chess, but you have one super powerful move that it works. It's not like a rook or a queen. No, it has no rules. It just king. I just. That's what she did. Basically. She had this super

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       powerful thing and it didn't work and it didn't work because this guy was a part of the protected class that she was part of and she tried her thinking of just like shortcuts to dismissing people, but no one else could pull that off except a black man or black woman if, if, because of who he is. He had the checkmate and he's like, ha ha, and the whole world went, ha ha, because we've all seen that, but it you can't say anything. If I. If I was having this discussion with her and she said, because of your white privilege, I'd have to say, look, okay, let's go through the thing. Let's unpack that. A fucking hate that word unpack. I hate it because it's always brought. It's always brought out by people who really aren't on packing shit. They're just explaining to you how their ideology trumps your ideology and it's almost always like this preposterous way of describing things.

Speaker 3:          02:47:03       Let me unpack that for you. Oh fuck you. But he didn't have to. He didn't have to say that. He said, I'm black, and that was the ultimate unpacking. Boom, and whether he's right or she's right. It's like the those words white privileged. Oh, that's. That creates so many fucking headaches. It does, but you think it's real though? Yes, for sure. It's real. It's real because it's racist. Don't target me the way they would target a black person that's 100 percent real. It gets used in this sloppy way and it gets used to dismiss people and I don't think that's useful in the real problem is not white privilege. The real problem is racist. Actual racists. That's the real problem and if there was no racist, that white privilege wouldn't be a thing. It's only a thing because of racists and it's only a thing with racists without racist.

Speaker 3:          02:47:51       It doesn't exist. The problem with african americans or asians or asians as the real, like this is a weird one, right? Like the harvard thing where asians are denied entry into harvard with the same standards that white people have, like if because of racism, because they're good because they study so hard and they do too, but if you look at that law suit in the language that the school use to sort of describe them as antisocial and robotic and all of these stereotypes. So awful. It's crazy. It's so crazy. You should read wesley yang on this. He's a really interesting writer about this. We're saying you should have in mind, I would love to book a book of essays called. I think it's actually called the souls of yellow folk this year. I used to. I used to teach taekwondo for a living and it was around a lot of korean people and uh, one when I learned taekwondo from a korean man, when I learned and I was around so many korean people, I was stunned by the, the work ethic that exists in these, these families and the, the humbleness and the, the, the way it was almost expected

Speaker 1:          02:49:08       that you never brag and that you work harder than anybody. And I had a friend who was, he was on the u, s taekwondo team to compete in the olympic games. He was working on his school work. He was going through his residency, so he's probably working on schoolwork 10 to 12 hours a day in between classes. He would put his book bag on. He would fill his book bag up with with books and run the stairs at the university up and down. And then he would come to the gym at night and train and then he would travel to compete with the world team and all the. All the. Meanwhile he was in his college. He was, he was going to medical school. I mean he had bags under his eyes. You could stuff christmas trees. It was fucking insane. This guy was always tired, but the work ethic that he had was just.

Speaker 1:          02:49:56       I didn't have one 10th of that worth work ethic. It was. It was impossible to ignore and he was so spread then and so tired all the time. But he kept working and he would talk about his culture and he would talk about his family and what is expected of him. Like he's like, man in my house like that. You just fucking did it. Like you don't. You're just not. There's not like, oh, I feel tired today. Fuck you. Get up, go to work. And that attitude has allowed so many asian people that discipline and, and, and just this culture of performance and of achievement where it's so, it's so cherished that is allowed so many asian people to excel in, in academia. And the fact that harvard somehow or another steps in and says, warm, we're gonna. We're gonna. Make it more difficult for you because you work so hard. that is so crazy and so weird. It's so weird that they as this. I mean, if you think about, if you think about institutions of higher learning, harvard is the first one you think about this number one, it's number one, I call he graduated from harvard. Oh whoa, dun dun, right? Harvard. And to, to have them so blinded, it's, it's amazing that they will be racist against the best performance because they're performing too well and there's a disproportionate number of them in the university. So we're gonna make it harder. We're going to raise your standards.

Speaker 4:          02:51:19       Yeah. I just think that the actual, like the stereotypes and the way that they sort of fucking crazy. Yeah. It's crazy. It's crazy. You had them on. I would love to. Where's he out of? Do you know? Montreal? Montreal. Okay. I've actually never. I'm trying to think if I've ever met him. I've never met him, but he's, he's an interesting writer and he'd be really, really good on this. Better than me. Especially because I'm fading. Well, let's wrap it up. We're, we're three hours and 20 minutes. are you serious?

Speaker 1:          02:51:47       There's a time warp in this light in here. Oh, there's 3:25. Well, there's. Look, I'm so happy we finally got together and talked. It was wonderful to have this conversation with you. I really appreciate it. I was very impressed by you and thank you very much. We're going to trip. We're going to go to on trip. We're going to do it. Jamie's coming. It's gonna. Bring this camera. Thanks so much. Thanks everybody.
