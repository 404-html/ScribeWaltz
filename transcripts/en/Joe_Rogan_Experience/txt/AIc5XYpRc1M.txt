Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Three two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       Stir it up, nick. We're live. Hello everyone. Hello everyone. Put the uh, ear cups on and cheers, sir. Oh Man. Thank you joe. Thanks for being here, man. Yeah. Thank you for breaking me out here man. I know we meant to do this before, but I hope now with all this good energy between us, we can do this properly for the Indians. Yeah, for sure. Listen, man, to say that you've had a crazy experience in this life is one of the most understated things a person could ever say.

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       I mean,

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       where do we begin? Right? Let's tell everybody your store. So you were wrongfully committed of murder. You spent 22 years on death row before you were exonerated by DNA evidence.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:00:55       Hello everyone. My name is Nick Harris and I was X. Joe said, convicted and sentenced to die for rape and murder. I didn't commit at the age of 21 in 1981 of woman named Mrs. Craig was murdered in Delaware. I have never met the woman. I was in prison on unrelated charges and I stupidly made up a story to try and get out of those charges. The police soon feel realized that I was a liar and they fabricated the charges around me then so it's ironic than in a few days you're going to upper darby, Pennsylvania, and that's where the murder happened. Really. Basically, and Linda May, Craig was leaving her job at 4:05 PM on December 15th, 1981 she's going home. She gets abducted. I don't know any of this, but I tried in desperation to get out of a lie that this officer put on me. Fuck, I got pulled over in a stolen car.

Speaker 3:          00:01:51       The cop beats me up. He puts charges on me. I'm facing life imprisonment and I'm a junkie because all of my life I was destroyed by what happened to me. At the age of seven I had my head beaten him by a man with a rock in his hand after he sexually assaulted me and I did all the stupid things that people can do in the aftermath. I kept it a secret and I let it foster all the anger in me. I became very aggressive as a child and I ended up in trouble all the time. And when I was in prison on these unrelated charges to the murder, I stupidly fell into that mindset of desperation of trying to get out of it. So the police put a prisoner in the cell next to me. He said, I confess to him, I was given a three day trial.

Speaker 3:          00:02:36       I was sentenced to death and put on death row. And then stupidly I escaped from prison in 1985 and ended up on the FBI's most wanted list to get out. I was being transported to court and the sheriffs were being cool. We have, first they were talking about what was going on in Philly. They were two nice like sixties [inaudible] 68 67 and we drove five hours from one of the hardest prisons in America called Huntington. And I left there after spending two years of my first two years in silence. So if you opened your mouth, they would come in and beat your head. And so I was so glad to get in the car cause my mom was waiting in my lawyer's office cause they were gonna give me a review of my trial because they withheld so much evidence. So I was eager to go to court and it was the coldest day of 1985 February 15th we stop at a gas station and in Exton, Pennsylvania.

Speaker 3:          00:03:37       And as I got out of the car, the officer driving, pull past the cubicles. Now we all got out of the car and ran over to the cubicle together and I went in to start a peon and an is holding the door for me and my eyeglasses start fogging up. You know what I mean? Cause you go from the freezing cold to warm to the cold, your eyeglasses. So all I know is I turned around and I come out and he has the door like that and I put my head down, go under his arm and I turned left and go back to the car. And the dude smoking a cigarette, doesn't know that his partner, when the cubicle, the pis and as I'm running back to the duty, pulls his pistol out and point blank shoots at me, Joe like Paul. And as it went past my face, I was like, Oh shit, I hit the ground, I ran and he's following me with the gun.

Speaker 3:          00:04:26       I could feel it like, um, like I was waiting from the blast me, you know, cause he thought it overpowered his partner. Oh he doesn't know his testimony at trial was I turned around, Nick's running at me and my partners down are gone. I pulled my gun and he runs and I, I wasn't going to let a death row prisoner run. So I've tried to stop him. I shot. So I run around the corner, I hit the ground, I ripped all the skin off my hands. I've run around the corner and I fly towards this restaurant and there's all these people innocently eaten dinner and I'm running right towards the plate glass window cause he ain't going to blast me, you know. And I ran like I knew he couldn't shoot. And then I shot around the corner and I ran down to a gas station.

Speaker 3:          00:05:06       I tried to steal a car that didn't work. Then I ran like 400 yards, 400 yards, 400 yards, and I hid behind the car. I just escaped from and I was laying in the weeds behind the gas station, about 50 yards from a muddy road screaming, who was the bigger idiot for letting this happen? And I was thinking, oh my God, like what am I doing? What do I do, Joe? What? Like how do I just jump up and say, wait a minute, it was a mistake. You know that he already tried to shoot me in the face, right? So I go high behind the police station. Next four hours I'll have my God, I'm Jeanne paid, chased by a helicopter and he chases me and he pins me and he chases me. And I was so fit that I ran for four hours through the woods without care, with the branches did to my face or nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:05:48       Man, I blew out both quads. I did my, my hamstrings. I ripped my feet open. I ran so hard in terror that I didn't care, man. And I got away and I, I made it all way to Florida and I was going to lead the country, you notice? And I said, I got to go back. How did you get to Florida? I stole a dude's wallet, New York, and I got on an airplane and I went down to Florida and I tried to rob a drug dealer and I tried to do just, I was sitting there, I was so angry. I was going to kill myself. I was on, uh, I'll never forget this day.

Speaker 3:          00:06:21       I didn't want my folks to see me in prison. Handcuffs no more, you know, so I was going by a raft and it's going to go on the ocean and I was going to have one last party, but all the foods that I loved, then I was going to stab the raft, wait for the sharks, have to cut my wrist, you know, and then it was going to cap myself and go. Then I said, no, I'm going back. So I turned myself back in. They put me on death row in Florida and I went back and I faced it, you know, say beat me for four minutes, man. They broke my face, broke my back, crushed me, man, tortured me and I thought I'm to get you back, you know, for all the days you made me go in a cage and beat some other prisoner while you stood there with a club laughing at me, I'm going to get you back. I'm going to make sure I started being a loving person again.

Speaker 3:          00:07:11       So I'm sitting there in 1985 1986 with a 105 years plus the death penalty. And I decided, fuck this, I'm going to be a nice guy. So I started to learn, okay, I suffer from Aphasia. I had my head beaten him with a rock. So what is Aphasia? Aphasia can be identified simply in people who have stuttering disorder. Their brain and their of vernacular abilities are distorted by disruption in their brain. Either their brain is functioning too fast or their mouth is functioning too fast, or there's a combination of the two misfiring and Aphasia can be through trauma or through genetics. And Aphasia affected my life so much as a young person, I never had the respect to listen to people because I couldn't function. I couldn't articulate, I couldn't speak when I was at trial, people spoke words that I didn't understand and it frustrated me. And when I tried to speak and I stuttered, people would be like that. Uh, C'mon retard. When he got to say so after that beaton where they beat me for four minutes and he broke my face, I began practicing speaking to myself.

Speaker 3:          00:08:26       Every day I learn new words and I taught myself how to correctly articulate that word into a sentence beautifully from my own self and myself every day. And then I became very, very good at writing. I began helping other prisoners. I became the most dangerous prisoner that they held because I cared about other men. I wrote to their mothers. I wrote letters to their lawyers. I gave up opportunities for people to write books about me so I could help another innocent man. I did all those things because that's how I got back at him for night. They did to me. So in 1988 I'm sitting in my cell and I read about Dna and I knew right then I could prove my innocence. So I was the first man in America in February of 1988 to ask for DNA testing to prove my innocence. And he threw away out hot tubs and material.

Speaker 3:          00:09:23       And when I discover new evidence, they destroyed that. And his woman who came to meet me and start visiting me fell in love with me and she believed in me. So she stood by me and told me that she would be with me either to the gallows walk or to the Moma approved medicines. And for nine years she stood by me, you know. And finally we found some evidence that was testable in 1995 what? What was the evidence? It was sperm from the rape and it was being sent out here to California, to Dr. Edward Blake. And it broke open and transport and spilled. So Jackie left me, had nothing left, and then they put me in a special unit and it started torturing me. I keep this part quiet. I never told a story. It would ruin what happened if you're a 13 it's now out on Netflix, but they finally closed down the old prison I was in for 12 years, where the average rate of survival is only five and I was wanting hard as Jews there and I made it.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       They closed the prison down and open up green county, Super Max. And the courts ordered that every prisoner in Pennsylvania be loud out of their cell for eight hours. The administration looked at each other it fuck that. Not the crazy cannibals and not to serial killers, not the dudes that have been assault and rape and each other. So they picked 48 if it us out and they put us in Pittsburgh and a special penitentiary setting in which we were in a sealed unit and they put all these guards in there. They weren't allowed to touch other prisoners because they're so violent and told them that we're giving you the craziest of the crazy. You know, Buffalo Bill from silence of the land was a real man, right? His name was Gary Hide Nick. He abducted black women in Philadelphia and put them in a pit under his house and fed one of them to the other survivors because he was building a master race.

Speaker 3:          00:11:17       He was my neighbor man, like so they started torturing us and doing all this psychological crazy shit to his word. They were feeding us to each other like wolves. So I kept it all quiet until this year when, once again, misfortune fell on my life and I released monsters a madman, the new book that I was going to give you today, and I thought, you know, I got to tell that story, you know? But it's been so hard to come back from these moments, Joe. It's just like I look at what they did to me and how I went to that moment where the DNA is gone, Jackie leaves me. And so I find that I'm dying from Hepatitis C that they did learn. They infected me of it when they broke my teeth when they beat me. So I asked to be executed. I said, I studied all the world's religions. I read over 9,000 books. I did everything in piety. My mother asked me to do, I don't want a guy like they'll carter did with the cards, come into his cell and taunting them, you know, teasing him and listen to a man scream in agony because the pile in his belly is killing them. So I wrote to the courts and I asked to be executed. I said, fuck it man.

Speaker 3:          00:12:37       I want to die as a man. I love who can respect himself.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       The court intervened in order to DNA testing that was going to be done on evidence is spelled July of 2003 the DNA test come back and he proved innocent. How did so the, the dea evidence spilled and they just captured it. Once it spill, it was in a box with all this evidence. And Dr. Edward Blake who did the Oj Simpson trial DNA, said that there would be challenges to it if he did the DNA in 1999 1998 and 2003 they had advanced mitochondrial DNA separation so well that he felt confident in his results. So the federal court got involved and said, look, I don't want to have this man executed. I want the DNA done. So they did that and it was amazing that on the day that I called the lawyers, they revealed the truth to me. I called his lawyer and I'm like, what's up?

Speaker 3:          00:13:37       He goes, nick, we got DNA from three separate sources that prove you're innocent. I said, that's amazing, Mike. I, I'm, I'm really grateful. He goes, you know, we used to tell people you're crazy that we never believed in you. I'm really sorry for that. I'm like, man, really? You want to take away my joy now, man. So I was really downcast at the day. I called my mother, my brother, Mikey was having a seizure at her feet cause he was an alcoholic after he fell off a roof and he died shortly after. So he just went fucking crazy from there. They take me off death row and they put me in a psychological cell and they tell me they can't trust me, that no human being who has had done to them what we've done to. You cannot be angry that we open this door up and we let you out. You're going to get us. So we're going to leave you until the day they let you out. We're going to leave you in this cell because we don't trust you not to kill us for what we did to you. What did they do to you?

Speaker 3:          00:14:45       He to have the thing called gladiator day, so to lieutenant will be off on a Sunday. And the guards who started to come from the Philadelphia area were black. Nadian liked the guards up in the hillbillies, beaten on black prisoners. So a weird thing happened where this lieutenant came up with an idea, we'll look, let's let the prisoners get this frustration outta you guys buy you pick out the biggest guy and you pick out this guy. So one day I'm sitting there minding my own business and they open up my cell and there's four of them were clubs Europe. So I got to go in the cage and I got to go and hurt somebody while they stand outside. And if you don't fight, they're going to come in and they're going to be worse than you can beat a man or get beaten by one man.

Speaker 1:          00:15:30       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:32       So they did all this for their entertainment. Would they ever punished for this? Not until after the riot on one of them testified against the others for the murder and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:15:45       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:15:46       I've watched the 11 people commit suicide. I've been stabbed, strangled, beaten, senseless. The cards used to talk because I was a qs. If a psychological murder of going out and stock and his poor woman, because she looked like my girlfriend, they said I was never treated like a prisoner. I was treated with deference. The worst word I know in English dictionary do we I was treated was so harsh that it was cruel beyond cruel and yet all I wanted to do was have enough within me to learn to beautifully speaks. It didn't on a date at the executed me. I could tell them how much I cared about myself.

Speaker 1:          00:16:28       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16:29       I was more important to me than living because somehow when you suffer like I've suffered, your head cracks open and you have this hyper sensitivity to life so that when you touch the human beings, you never forget the 14 years no one was allowed to touch you. You know what? Fuck this. I ain't crying no more. It's all right, man. There's nothing wrong with crying. I just thought about it. You know what Joe? I do because I feel better for the whole shit you shouldn't feel because I look in your arms and your eyes and I see the hurt that I'm causing you for doing. No, no, no. Don't worry about that, man. All right, well this is what I know I'm doing is trying to imagine what your life has been like. Don't you worry about me at all? I'm harder than life and I'm kinder than love.

Speaker 3:          00:17:21       Secretly. I'm a saint. It never hurt no one. I try my best to be played every day and I've had misfortune and I return and a very sorry that I sit in this chair today after it came about. You see, I believe in good. I believe good is going to when Joe and uh, I believe that I had again and was three years again when years ago when I met my wife, current wife Laura. See, I had a woman in my life before that used me and left me here in Los Angeles. I ended up homeless on the streets here and I was actually living up in this area on the streets because my good friend Noah, lives around here. Him and Jason took care of me and my bad times I call it. So I go back to England, I meet this woman, fall in love.

Speaker 3:          00:18:19       We have a baby and she's born on your birthday. And I start to believe in hope again. I go do a podcast and England with my good friend Brian from Chew Jordy. And I start to spread my message again and I want to get all these young kids to believe in themselves. And then one day I put the baby down for a nap and I get Laura to lay in my arms because she's sick and we'd get up 20 minutes later and the baby's dead and I'm coming down the steps with the bed dead baby. And um, you know, all fucked up again. And then people are so cruel that in the village they started, you know, maybe the baby was killed by the guy on death row when all this shit. And I have a stalker ex wife, Karen, who just won't leave me alone, contacts to police and tells him that I put out a tweet that I, and it only happened because my good friend Anthony Simon Don, he was in the green room, told me the day before my daughter died about have good close friend of his, they lost a baby that day.

Speaker 3:          00:19:20       And so when our baby died, I put out a tweet to saying, you know, appreciate the people in your life cause they're so precious. And the police came to our house and humiliated me and wanted to know how I could tweet about something because my clock was nine hours off because I was living on the streets of Los Angeles and my time was still on la time. Cause the anthony and I are developing a major motion picture about my life. And I told the police, what are you crazy? Like why would I so I can't even get a break on the death of my daughter like the, that was the moment that the director of the film fear of 13 decided to rip me off for my rights to the film. Um, I decided to rip you off how he owed me 50,000 pounds from doing the film.

Speaker 3:          00:20:05       Fear of 30 decided to rip you off because he thought you killed your baby. Now he decided to rip me off and not pay me my money. When I asked him I needed money to bury my daughter. So I end up in a shouting match with authored the Moelis, the billionaire from Boston. I promised to get on his plane and come kick his ass over the money. We're arguing over cause I begged I, it was crazy. I ended up, I'm still confused. What? So your child dies, is it my child dies and everything goes badly on syndrome. Yes. And everybody that I counted on to have my back, including director David Sinkton who promised to pay me for my participation in the film all then tell me, well no, I'm not paying you. And I'm like, how can you do this when I need this money to bury my baby?

Speaker 3:          00:20:51       Why did he say it wasn't paying? Cause he said he didn't owe it to me and all this. I said, boy, are you crazy? You, you have a written contract. So it's the same thing. You know how that entertainment businesses, once they get what they get out of you, that's it. So he just said he wasn't going to pay you what the contract said. Right. So author demaurice invested in the film and he owns most of it. So I write to author, I call myself author. David's not paying me my money, can you help me? Cause he owned most of the film by that point. So author gets all annoyed at me. I said, look man, my daughter just died. I blew up at him. I told them, send me your private jet or come to Boston, we can have a fist fight. You love to fight and all that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:21:32       I just lose control. And then author out of His grace sends me some money so we could bury the baby. But it went through all this terrible shit. So I started, I said, now I'm going back to America. So I leave England, I come over here. I got two daughters with Laura. We go over here now and the Oregon and Anthony, my God, I meet this amazing man only because of Muhammad Ali dying. And now he's going to help me make a major motion picture about my life. So I get away from all that trauma of losing a baby and being humiliated by people thinking I would do some shit to a little girl. And I go back and rebuild everything and then I try to go to Canada and they won't let me in as crazy, so I can't go do my job there. I lose all.

Speaker 3:          00:22:17       Don't let you in because you were on death row for 22 years. Yeah, I know you're innocent. Not only that, I just came from speaking before the United Nations sitting next to the president and current former presidents of Switzerland and I have a security clearance from that. I worked in a high profile job in England going around speaking over to governments, but Canada holds it against me because I escaped from death row, so I can't enter the cat. The country of Canada, Robin Sharma tried to have me come up there and speak for him with his conference and I had the humiliating. They do it from my home via skype. It's like, I'll never stop being punished for what happened, you know what I mean? But I don't care about that. What really bothered me, it was that all those things started to fall me and I started losing hope again.

Speaker 3:          00:23:04       So I go and I even tried recently just to have a normal job and give up everything. I, I'm a beautiful speaker in schools and I go around and try and help people with their education. Right? So I was trying to do that the last year with a, a friend of mine named Wayne Sharp from New Zealand. He has a company called my verse and he wants to help children find the correct path. Education so important. We can't get that gone. I can't, I just decide I'm going to give up everything and just go get a normal job. But that doesn't work. So I'm sitting there and it's Jamie's birthday and I'm angry like, what the fuck? How could it fall apart again, sit in, you contact me after I tweeted and it all starts again. I'm back to believe in that. It doesn't matter how it got in his chair or it doesn't matter. That demand proceeding me has everything and I had nothing. I still believe in you this time and I told you now I messed. I sent, yes it fucking Hell Joe, you're going to change my life. Doing is, man, you could have to do this. You didn't have to be nice to me.

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       Yeah

Speaker 3:          00:24:14       you are. And for that man, I'm willing to keep going.

Speaker 1:          00:24:18       Cool.

Speaker 3:          00:24:22       I can't, I mean I don't think anybody can imagine what it's like to spend 22 years on death row for something you didn't do. I'm wanting you to go back to the night that you got arrested and tell us cause you, you kind of, there's some tissue right? Besides you if you want it. Yeah, I'm good. I'm daughter crying.

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:24:44       go ahead bro. It's just the night you were, how old were you were (202) 012-0120 I turned 21 before he sentenced me to death. I'm 20 years old. I'm a Philly kid and I'm high on meth and the music's blasting drive into chester, Pennsylvania and the stolen car and everything in my life is just chaos. I'm fighting with my two brothers all the time and no one has respect for me. I was ugly and it's two o'clock in the morning. I just came from a bar. I go through a stop sign and the next thing I know, I saw the lights, I pull over and beating and my head's out of control and I'm sitting there gripped with fear. I took a beat and Philly in December 4th of that same year in which they ripped all my teeth up. Oh. Would a blackjack. So I was really scared, you know, I was like, don't move. Don't run. Don't do nothing stupid. You took a beating from cops earlier? Yeah. You know, Philly cops put me in my place because I ran my mouth. So,

Speaker 1:          00:25:56       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:25:57       there I am sitting there and the next thing I know, bam on the window, Bam. And he rips open the door and uh, attract from bad company was playing really loud and he, I can't hear any or make focus of what he's saying, you know, and then exiting or no, boom, right up out of the car. And he's got me on the duckhorn and his name is Benny, right. And he's six foot four and he's gotten me pressed against the top of the car and he's holding me down and I can't breathe. So I start resisting. I popped his arm off and the adrenaline goes, boom, here comes the beast out of me cause it's six two and that age I was crazy tough man. I was like off the charts and so I pushed him back. I remembered that and he couldn't believe it.

Speaker 3:          00:26:39       He pulled out his stick and raised it up and I just snatched it out of his and chucked it away. I was looking at him like, I was like, that's Zombie guy. And he went furious many, pulled out the pistol and I seen it coming and I grabbed his hand and I pushed down and I had my arms out stretched and the gun whoop boom, down into the ground like that. I looked at him and he put the gun up there and he's dead. Motha fucking Wuss. He puts me in a car. I'm sitting in the backseat, I'm freaking out. You know, he gets in the car and he's, he's like jumping back and forth from the front seat. Then he waits and he looks at me in the mirror and he grabs the mic and he's going like shots fired officers. This shots fired. He looks at me one more last time he goes, help, help, help. It could still going on and like, um, I'm like, what? Like what? What's going on? Dude tells them when they get there, the backup officers get there. He's like, he tried to kill me. He's got my gun and I got it back from him. I'm like,

Speaker 3:          00:27:35       no, this is going south. They jacked me up, take me out of the car, beat me down, take me to jail. Now I'm charged with attempted murder and kidnapping of a police officer. I'm 20 years old and I meet skipped Dimatteo public defender who didn't tells me I'm facing life imprisonment and that's it, and they're going to put me into security wing because my bail is gonna be so high. I looked at him, I said, what do you mean man? I was just trying home a minister one car, like he said, no man, you ain't never going home. So I broke down and I went through detox with note no help, you know. So three days I'm in a cell with nothing but this newspaper. And as the headline on the newspaper, Mrs Craig's murder, and it starts taunting me, taunting me, it's hot. Somehow in my head, I came up with this crazy mantra. If I knew something about something that big up, you can let me go about this lie. I didn't try to kill nobody. I was sitting on my bed and the guard was walking by and he goes, what's wrong with you?

Speaker 3:          00:28:43       And I started telling him what was going through my head, the whole story. And that was it, Joe. Oh my God. He ran down the block. He rented a sergeant's office. They got me to the warden. The warden's now been told to say, you're telling them what's going on in your head. So I repeated it. You had, you had a plan to tell him a story, to tell them a lie. And when that officer responded because he heard the story, I didn't have any idea what the impact of my words were. I was so stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:29:13       Oh, you were also going through detox? Yeah. And so they take me to the awards office and he starts praising me. They take me out of solitary confinement. Tell me I'm doing a great job. What did you tell him? I told him that a man that I knew in the area had told me he had done the crime and that if they let me out, I would tell them all about it. And he told me I was helping the community. They were taking me out of solitary confinement and all that. They told that, uh, they spoke to officer, right and he was going to retract his charges and only charged me resisting arrest and they were going to drop the rest of the charges and everything was going to be good. And then three days later they came back and said, dude, you lied. And the only reason you lied is because you want to tell us that you did this. They put me in a room and start doing all this shot. They find out that you lied to do did I made the story up. A was no longer a drug addict. And he had an alibi.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       So you just tried to pin the story on, on some other drug addict they do to rob me a rolled me up in a rogue and tried to kill me with a three 57 magnum. So I figured, I heard the story that he was dead and figure out he won't even find him anyway, you know. But a 20 year old doesn't have any concept of, you know, complex stuff like this, especially in the 80s. Right. Dude, they came right back to me and they had me in a Delaware County district attorney's office and this detective Martin told me no certain terms. I was gone tell him why I killed that woman. I wasn't leaving that room. So for 13 hours they tortured me. Matt started bringing up my childhood and all that Shit. I told him, man, I just wanted to blow up my whole world like a Nasssa.

Speaker 3:          00:30:55       Oh, that's good. So this is my confession consists of, um, and I kill anyone. I never meant to kill anyone. That's good. That's good. You never meant to kill her. What are you talking about? So I went to trial and I was given a three day trial for the murder of Mrs. Craig after the jury found me not guilty of all my original charges. So I was really frustrated that a jury heard the testimony of officer right. He would later be fired from the force, uh, being caught up in a drug gang and chester, he was dirty. Uh, but they didn't know that at the time. But a jury found me not guilty. That prosecutor, my mental, when that happened and he decided to seek the death penalty. So a month after I was found guilty, not guilty of all my original charges that I made the stupid story up.

Speaker 3:          00:31:47       I, they gave me a three day murder trial. That in essence was a joke. And what they did was they prayed upon the poor jury and showed them pictures of the victim and stuff like that, man. And they had an inmate who burglarized the prosecutors home and was facing 20 years come into court and say, I confessed to him. That was it. So the inmates so that you confessed to him, Charles Catalina, they got to got to do that. Yup. So I'm sitting there and they dropped a bomb on me. I know it's coming. The jury was so crest at, they went out to the wagon wheel restaurant and put their dessert order on hold while they found me guilty. And then during the sentencing phase they had their dessert.

Speaker 1:          00:32:32       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:32:33       I was 20 years old, man. I'm like, this isn't real man. I never killed a this woman. How can this happen? You know? And then Yoni mistake I truly think I made was that I told the judge go to hell when he sentenced me to death because he couldn't look me in the face. Why do you think that's a mistake? Because he decided to send me to Huntington prison. The hardest prison in America at that time wasn't going to do before that, I don't know. But he made sure I went to the place that they broke. You see, Huntington was designed as the prison. If he raped another inmate, they sent you there. It was the first shoe program in America. It was the first really what does shoot program? A special housing unit or security housing unit were s level five supermax, you know, like Pelican Bay.

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       And uh, your punishment was that you weren't allowed to speak in yourself and if you got caught speaking in yourself, they came in with a nurse and they, after they beat you down, she jabbed you in the ass with thorazine and they knocked you off for a week and you lost your mind. So it was horrible. Like I told you the first two years of my sentence, every day I kept my mouth shut. I didn't care what was done around me. And you weren't allowed to say a God damn word and a minute and you know, a lot of talk to other inmates. Nothing. I day to sing happy birthday to yourself like I did. I paid for that one. They fucked me up, Joe. But I don't care about that. Look, I realized I was in a race.

Speaker 3:          00:34:10       I had to kill off the person that I was. The person that I initially was upon entering prison was a deceitful, lying, coward, but know fortitude because no self respect resided within me and in utter humbleness, I took everything that they did to me and I paid for every window. I broke everything I stole, rely at all, and then I started to love myself. I figured I ain't get nothing out of this but misery. So I'm going out like the dude. I'm a stand up and not misspeak beautifully on the daily to execute me. I'm a walk to that walk, man. I'm a Judas. I didn't kill that woman, but I damn sure ain't no coward. I'm going to find out everything I can about life and then I'm gonna face my death. I'm a do. It was [inaudible] man, like I had this beautiful, beautiful speech ready for him too.

Speaker 3:          00:35:11       I was going to lay it out and just be at peace because I realized there was nothing else to do. I could fight. I couldn't argue. It didn't matter because God's in control of my life and I really believed that I had a choice, either be a bitter pill and get sucked dry by all the misery of mountain me or get my shit right and start loving myself. So I taught myself how to speak and overcome this, uh, Aphasia. It affected me my whole life and I found out that I was giving myself neuro-plasticity healing and I became very graceful and calm and prison. I was so serene and so powerful. How'd you find out you were giving yourself neuroplasticity healing? I found that out from Robin Sharma, Robin Sharma's, the foremost authority on speaking about neuroplasticity healing. And when he found about what I speak about, he said, I am the living embodiment of his teachings.

Speaker 3:          00:36:10       That through grace and dignity and kindness, I've developed my own charisma that carries me with confidence. And that is the description of what he teaches professionals, beginners, everyone to explain neuroplasticity for people to neuroplasticity is a reward system within your brain where in your interactions, especially with other human beings, heals you. So people who suffer from PTSD, people who have had trauma in their lives can actually heal themselves by being meticulously polite. And I began all of this when I was released. My mother sat me down and she said, Nikki listened to me. For you to get out of prison and not be a nice man is a waste of everyone's time. Every prayer, every time someone called me to mother of monster, every time a woman's spit in my face, every thing that I went through is a waste of time for you not to be a nice man.

Speaker 3:          00:37:11       So I want you to promise me one thing every day I want you to go out and say, yes ma'am. Yes sir. And thank you because I want you to show respect for who you are and that way they hurt this family badly. It's the only thing I ask. I didn't notice. She handed me the tool to healing because neuroplasticity is the self contrived act of rewarding yourself for being a nice person. And my gift over the last 14 years is that I made myself so amazingly pliable and gifted at helping others find the good within them. That's the reason I'm truly here today. The thing that I've been able to accomplish through my writing and through my efforts is to show people that you take things personally in life, you'd be then a full, because what you've done is you've taken all the hurts and you've made them to justify reason why you have to be an asshole to somebody.

Speaker 3:          00:38:14       Whereas you keep forgetting that you've been given a break over and over just to be here, man. Dude, I've been shot, stabbed, strangled, run over by a car, hung myself in prison to drug overdoses and I had accountable trying to murder me for two solid years. I know that I could fall at any moment from my own hand, but God blessed me. I believe so much in my purpose in life that I won't kill myself. I won't give up and it's only because I've been tested that I know that it has to be for a reason. I had dreams about all this while I was in death row. I had the most amazing, intense dreams because of my suffering and they play out now. So what happened? Did I manage to touch something we're all chasing. Where am I in a delusional world? Because I, what do you mean by that?

Speaker 3:          00:39:09       I told people last June, last year, I told everybody on facebook something was going to bag was going to happen and it did when my daughter broke her elbow. So I told everybody before it happened two years ago, I told my wife Laura, I was coming back here to meet Anthony. So I'm on Donnie and go on the good news network and do a thing with Mei, Mei Ali, who's a good friend of mine and I told him how things would happen and sure enough, every time it's played out I, why did you think something was going to bad was going to happen when you said something bad was going to happen, your daughter broke her arm. Dude, I'm in a meeting with a guy named Kevin and John and I look at them and I say, I have to, and I'm on Melrose Boulevard. My daughter is playing in the playground a few blocks away and I'm in this meeting with these men about my film.

Speaker 3:          00:40:03       I stand up at the table and I say to them, I have to go right now. I run outside and I asked my wife, Laura, is she okay? My daughter fell and broke her elbow and had to have six pins put into it and Cedars Sinai, we have a $63,000 bill did. It is stuck us with, but I knew it was going to happen before it did and I even told people it was going to happen. How can I have that touch? Did you knew that was going to happen specifically? I saw the event, but not in real time so I could make sense of it, but I saw the greenery at the park when we pulled up, it was the same and I had the flash last night when I met Stedman Graham. I had all these moments, that woman last night pinned the thing on my collar and she looked just like my mother and I had this dream because my mom died on September 9th and 10 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:40:55       I was actually on a flight September 11 for her funeral and it's all crazy how I saw all these things in my dreams on death row and they play out and it keeps happening with witnesses to my life that are recognizing it with me so I can't make it up. Do you know what I mean? I wish my friend Jason was here. He's, he's been able to help me just put this in context and I'm doing this badly, but I just think that somehow I went through an experience so intense that it is truly cracked open. Something that has given me a hypersensitivity to things. I think that it is allowed me truly to be humble enough to really give my life for a purpose and not be ego driven. Like I have nothing at this moment where we sit here, but I am so proud of the fact that that doesn't never stop me from believing in good and you could beat me all day.

Speaker 3:          00:41:52       You could put in a cage, you could do whatever you want to me, but it's up to me that didn't make it misery. I'm choosing not to men. I don't care how much I got a struggle from this point on or what grace is, and granted, I just want one thing to stay true in my life that I don't lose who I am. I fought so hard to be this man through a childhood of a feeling so inadequate because another man raped me to the feelings that I was so low of being cast aside as a condemned human being that then rise up and go and speak before governments. To the point that Kofi Annan told me that I was one of the finest speakers in the world to then go and follow that and stand at the base of the Coliseum where human beings were put to death for entertainment and blow 20,000 people away and have it flawlessly done.

Speaker 3:          00:42:45       And to recognize that I had it all within me to do because of one thing that neuroplasticity came me. Charisma, the kind of charisma you exude. So I don't know where it is that you hit that point where you decided to really believe in yourself, but like you said, you didn't listen to that shit that people were telling you. And once you did that, you started to contrive all this beautiful charisma because I didn't even watch the fight Saturday when you were talking, I listened to you and I thought he so flawless. It's not even thought of, but people would never grant you that you dad to do something in your heart, something within you made you believe in this guy,

Speaker 2:          00:43:24       man was I, I have not had much resistance at all. I'm going to be honest with you, like what you're, what you're saying about me is very kind. I really appreciate it, but really haven't had much resistance.

Speaker 3:          00:43:35       Yeah. But what it is about you that makes you believe in yourself. Yeah. What happened? Where'd you hit that point?

Speaker 2:          00:43:43       Well, I'm pretty sure it came from martial arts, from martial arts competition when I was very young, pretty sure from the first, the first, when neither neither. Just, um, just how difficult it was. Just, um, um, doing it from 15 to, uh, uh, before I was 22, I stopped somewhere around 22, but there's just the fact that it was so difficult that it, uh, it taught me hard work, taught me focus and, and uh, I didn't have anything before that before that I thought it was a loser, like a really thought it was a loser. I don't know. My father, um, my Stepdad's a very nice guy, but there's something about growing up without a father that is still alive, that doesn't talk to you. And you know, my mom worked all day. My stepdad worked all day. There was no one around, you know, I just, uh, and we moved a lot of, didn't have any friends.

Speaker 2:          00:44:43       So I just, I just, um, I never felt like I was worthwhile, but that's what I wasn't anything like what you experienced? Nothing. But it was enough within you that it was the point where I needed to prove myself. That's what I need. I wanted to show, I, I, there was something inside me that I needed to show that it wasn't useless and the only way I could show that it wasn't useless was by being good at things. And initially it was art. And then after art it became, martial arts in the martial arts thing was more important than art because the martial arts tested me. Like art was beautiful because I could draw things and people would love them. And then it made me feel good that people liked my work. But it was, there's a big difference between that and the martial arts.

Speaker 2:          00:45:26       The martial arts was so difficult to do and to compete at a, you know, a national level, it was, um, every time I did it I was terrified. But after it was over, I felt better about myself and I understood that I could actually be good at things. So it was the first thing that I ever did that gave me a feeling of of value. So I went from being a loser to being an extreme winter. That's brilliant. But it was just, it is. But is your point though, but you're saying that people like held me back and that's not really the case. It wasn't, you know, I mean I'm sure people judged me one way or another because of fear factor, some of the other things. But the thing about going through the martial arts competition and everything, when I was young, I don't, I don't give a fuck how other people view me.

Speaker 2:          00:46:13       I don't, I just do what I like. I do what I like and I try to be nice. But that's where your charisma comes from and where you got that from, it's still yours, man. I admired it. A lot of people don't have the confidence to do that, to shut it off. That noise, that thing that makes us all react to every one else's opinion. Well I react to it. I mean, I, I'm, I'm most certainly feel it, but I just don't, don't, I don't let it change the way I, I go through life. And, uh, I think because of the lessons that I've learned, I try to express that as much as possible for people that haven't gone through those same lessons. So I can, I can, I can express that information and maybe people can absorb some of it without having to go through what I went through.

Speaker 2:          00:46:59       I think what you went through is infinitely more difficult, more trying. And I think that your message and your story can show people that in the worst possible scenario, the beginning of your life as a man, you're wrongfully committed to life in prison. You are going to spend the rest of your life until they execute you on death row and all the horrors that you've gone through to come out of that and to come out of that with a purpose of being a nice person and learning how to speak and learning how to speak clearly and confidently. Like there's a lesson in that that said, I mean, I mean this is almost like at a, at a religious level. I mean you talk about someone who's created a diamond from pressure. I mean that's what you've done well, you've done is you've, you've figured out a way to, despite all this raging hurricane of emotion that goes through your mind, that's caused you to cry when you think about these things, you can express yourself in a very clear way that lets people, it just at least peer through the window into what you've experienced in your life and it, it, it can give people a perspective that there just is very, very rare that someone gets fucked over in life as bad as you did.

Speaker 2:          00:48:31       Very, very rare and it's even more rare to come through at the end with a sense of purpose

Speaker 3:          00:48:37       everyday of my life. Someone writes me and tells me they didn't kill themselves today. Did you know that every day man, did he stop drugs? There's a young man living in my house named Zach curves is a really good friend of mine. He really changed his whole life since meeting me. Uh, even my close friends have told me I've changed their life and I appreciate it because I recognize a lot of times it's the good within then that's resonating and I'm proud of the fact that I have sat and listened to the words I kind of deserve for what I've tried and I'm going to learn in the future to accept the graces that you just did to me. Because in the past I always tried to, as you see, diminish it. I have worked very hard, Joe. I have worked very hard to craft, um, my work into writing and like your drawings.

Speaker 3:          00:49:37       I was so proud of having a number one bestseller in my first book and I was so proud of using my talent as a writer to then articulate what it's like to lose a baby and my journey through her eyes or to use, uh, this last effort in monsters, a med men too, to help people. It's okay to have a bigger secret than the one that people know you by and still live with it. And then when it's right, you can share it. Or I've made a point that I'm done writing because I've accomplished all my work as a writer and now I want to do one thing. Well, I want to help young students around the world take them so seriously with their education. I did over 500 of them in schools over England and Europe and stuff. I loved it, man. I got all these young lads and lasses to come back to me and show me degrees that they got when I showed him important are education was. And I, I really thrive in that. And Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:50:31       environment because I think that's where everything's still is for me. Somehow. Like I'm a kid, you know, who won't let go of needing to still chase the good in my life.

Speaker 3:          00:50:47       And I notice things in the woods and I know there's a billion things in the woods, but I'm still willing to walk that path and find something meaningful. And that's what I came here to really say is that I want to make an impact with my words, but not overdo it. So I don't want to do, uh, any other podcast after this one except for my friend Brian's. But I wanted to, the meaningful thing without it having to be attached to the social media draw that has hurt my life. So much

Speaker 2:          00:51:24       social media draw that has hurt your life. How has it hurt you live? Well, when my daughter broke her arm and we put up a go fund me page, I was viciously attack because people expect me to have funds but they don't know, you know, things need to have funds because of the movie and the book. And I'm not, I have nothing. I borrowed money to get here. Like people don't know that I'm wearing a shirt from my friend because he funded me to be here, you know, so I'd have food while I was here. It's like that real, you know, so people don't want me to not succeed. Like I hurt third image of me if I don't have wealth in addition to being this person before them. Well, I just think people just, they don't understand, you know, the people see someone else's life and they like to assume the worst and they like to criticize you whenever they have an opportunity.

Speaker 2:          00:52:13       So if they see any vulnerability, they pounce and you know what you've gone through is the opposite of what most people go through. People have difficult times in their life but more than difficult times. You know what they have. They have long periods where they don't have anything happen, where life is boring and life is just a dull gray and life is just work and coming home from work and the trials and tribulations of that and traffic and the kind of insane experiences that you had being wrongly convicted and spending 22 years confined in a cage forced to fight because of vicious psychopath guards that those kinds of experiences or the experiences that allowed you to come out of it. This very kind, very open minded person who's trying to better yourself and wants to see the best in other people, the people that go through their life and this dull state of jealousy and bitterness and resentment. And just constantly focused on themselves as self obsessive culture that we have. And one of the things about social media that's most fucked up is you're looking at all these other people's lives and shedding on them and comparing yourself to them and finding faults in them and attacking them in the comments section and attacking what the, and the people that are doing that, they're all doing that because they're in, they're in agony during a different kind of agony than you. But it's an agony of nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:53:56       I know. And I looked at it and I thought, I try to craft a beautiful message on the social medias so that I don't get caught up in arguments. And I always try to show the good dude in the world. And that's why I love like the good news network. I'll try and deliberately stay away from things that poisoned my mind cause I don't want to contribute. I don't want to get caught up in the trump era argument or the previous argument or the new argument. I want to post meaningful messages of good because that's my overall message. So I thought recently maybe I can contrive three beautiful messages for twitter, facebook, and Instagram, and I could leave out this wonderful message and then I can go about my business of going back into schools and talking to students because it gets too chaotic. Um, in addition to all the lovely messages of the, uh, wonderful human beings that listened to me speak, or they saw the film fear of 13, read one of my books, there's also a lot of women out there, men, and they'd been harassing me and bothering me. And it's put a lot of conflict in my life and I don't want that harass you and bothering you. How a lot of women fall in love because of the film. The film made me look very attractive. What is it about

Speaker 2:          00:55:08       women and men that are on death row?

Speaker 3:          00:55:10       There's the one too. Yeah, I know. So to it. Yeah. They'll contact me and tell me about their inmate. I'm not an inmate, I'm not a death row prisoner. I was on death row. That is a strange obsession that some women have it. And it goes to a psychological feature of women, uh, who can fix things with their loan. So they want me to deceive my wife, to be with them, but not be deceitful. They want me to ignore all the social chaos I could cause to go and leave a family to be with them, but they still want to harass me. And it was so bad recently, even on my anniversary, I had to cut off the people who were bothering me. I have a, uh, an act of stalker in my life. Uh, it's all kinds of crazy. Uh, I've gone through a lot of experiences where the social media is really tested me.

Speaker 3:          00:55:54       So I thought I'm going to try and be like the dude. All right, so they're going to execute me said that twice the day. The dude is the guy that knows art. So this is my last scene. You mean like from the Big Lebowski? Kind of like the dude man, like the dude so seriously. Jeff Bridges one of my heroes. What a moment. You know Chris Pine, Jeff Bridges, Ben Foster being interviewed about hell and high water and a asked Chris Pine, what do you watch? And he goes, oh my God, I got to tell you about fear of 13. I've got to tell you, Nikki Iris, man, this dude is the shit. You know what I mean? And my phone goes, yeah, I had dinner with him. He so really, really cool dude man. Wow. You need to have Chris on. He's a really cool dude. He really introspective and he's deep like he's a real good conversationalist.

Speaker 3:          00:56:39       I soak time. W w what else has he been in? All these bullies image up. Oh Dude, he just a blanket on him. He just did the one word oprah too. And he did the one before that with the Star Trek. Oh, that Guy Chris and wonder woman. Yeah. It's just as great on telling you, man, what are any a to invite me to dinner and hang out with him. And even Harvey Weinstein pops in for a minute. Holla. I'm like, no. And he's like, Harvey, you just produced that documentary. But the dude that was in jail or everything hit the fan. This is before things went tits up. I know. I had this real great blessing. So Alejandro Monte Verde, uh, who did the little boy with a Kevin James, he has an amazing life story himself. I mean his, his family was abducted by the kidnappers and executed. This is real drama.

Speaker 3:          00:57:33       The day I meet this man, I'm at a red carpet event in La and he goes home and watches fear of 13, and he comes back and he tells me, I'm going to make your movie. I'm going to help you. I don't know how, but God told me there's certain movies that have to make. And he's making one right now with Tim Ballard from the CIA about um, rescuing children from the sex trades and stuff. So he's doing really serious work. You know what I mean? So make a feature. Films that are going to make a feature film about me called conviction right now, it might be changed, but I got the script and it's fucking hard, man to read. But we have all these a list actors. And my dream of course was Chris Pine. Cause I think he's one of the best. Right? But I have no say.

Speaker 3:          00:58:12       But I get this amazing chance to come out here and meet all these people for the film being made. And I realize it's all meant to beam and like all this crazy stuff. So maybe if I craft my message right, I can step back and let people appreciate the message I had without distorting it. Cause I don't want to ruin it. I don't want to go too far and end up making a fool of myself when I thought the right thing to do was teach people about neuroplasticity and how to make yourself a really bad ass outside the ring by being a kind man and how to rarely make yourself a really nice person to the family and loved ones by having the self respect about yourself, to be patient in life and things like that. You know, and don't ruin it. So that's what I, you keep saying don't ruin it. You know, when you're talking about social media, I think one thing to take into consideration is when you do something like a go fund me or any, anytime there's anything controversial, those are magnets for hate and you might think that everyone hates you, but what you're dealing with is a very small amount of people from a very large amount of people that, sir, if you thinking about the whole

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       planet, right, and all the English speaking people, you're dealing with hundreds and hundreds of millions of people that can achieve so much in what you said. That's why I'm here now because on my website, [inaudible] dot org we organized so today's listeners can go there and download copies of my book. I can get out of destitute times. I can get my life together. We did everything we could knowing that this podcast is reaching a million people. So you're right. I do. I mean even you like your social media. What I mean is just the thing is to not get caught up in the numbers that come at you that are negative because it's just a sheer matter of volume, right? If you're reaching people through the Internet, you're reaching, who knows how many human beings. I think one out of a hundred is going to be the type of person that wants to send a hateful message because it's easy because they don't have to look you in the eyes when they do it.

Speaker 2:          01:00:13       They don't have to feel any social consequences. They don't have to feel your pain when they insult you or, or you know, say awful things, but you or your family, they're doing it because they want to affect you because they're hurting and they're hurting for a very different reason than the way you're hurting. But this is what's wrong with social media is because human beings are not meant to communicate that way. We lose our humanity in this very shallow form of interaction because all those parts, what's what's important about people's looking them in the eyes, talking to them, hugging them, shaking their hand, communicating honestly and anytime you you're missing any of those pieces. When you communicate dishonesty, when you don't want to shake someone's hand, when you don't want to look them in the eye, when you don't want to enter in your interact with them.

Speaker 2:          01:01:01       When you don't care about them as a person, all those things leave you feeling like shit and all those. That's true. You're right. The social media is the worst form of it because it's just text. You have to interpret it yourself. You don't know what the fuck is going on in their life. You don't know who they are, but you read that text and you absorb it personally. You absorb a personally, you take it in the worst possible form and you, you feel that critique in your chest, you feel it, you feel it in your head. And now I guess I got caught up in this notion that I could just copy a normal guy and have a normal job and people would leave me alone. Well, they would if you weren't on social media and uh, I, I've already entered that form so you don't have to stay in that form.

Speaker 2:          01:01:47       But it's true. But here's the thing. Even if you do use that form, you know what you can do. You just don't interact. You Sal is, that's the thing. That's what I said. I was on it too. It's hard for people to understand that are on the outside. They're like, well, you asked all, I love you. I want you to interact with me because I love you. You know, and I want you to recognize that I'm recognizing you and I appreciate that from people, but they have to understand the volume of people that someone like you is dealing with. That's what I tried to convey. And I try very sincerely, never to be ignorant to people. And you know, it's, it's fucking mind blowing joke.

Speaker 3:          01:02:19       Cause I had my mind made up and now I've realized that I do. And it all goes back to a conversation. What were boy Jason Daily? Me and him were driving along the four five one day in a film for it. Fear of 13 is about to come out. And I told him I didn't want it to come out and he said, you don't own that film. Every kid that's ever had a shitty childhood owns that film. Everybody who's got a broken marriage or a shitty lifers really struggling owns that film. If you fuck this up, I'll never be your friend again man. And he was right. I don't own the fear of 13 and I don't own really anything of it, but it's message is so beautiful. I did what I could to tell my story because we're all living our life as an experience, but we can only convey it as a memory.

Speaker 3:          01:03:08       And I did beautifully for myself and I'm so proud of the effort I made. I don't care that the director rob me, I'll make my way. I don't care what I went through to this moment because I truly appreciate the person who wrote me last night and said, two weeks ago I was released from a mental hospital after trying to kill myself. And my mom sat me down and made me watch film now, and the last two weeks I've been going to therapy and I'm getting my shit together. I don't film Joe and I don't own my message. I guess my message is taken on by the people who love me or not. You're right. I'm not going to be bothered by the negatives. I had a terrible experience with a Stalker for 12 years who won't leave me alone in it cost me and my daughter in a divorce, all kinds of crazy stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:03:52       So it was really affecting me and my current wife and I didn't like it, but I think I'm going to actually beat a dude and just hang around for a little bit longer and make you proud of me for what I do from heroin. Well, don't worry about me man. Now everyone that I love as though to always be on that list, man, I really, that's what you use for motivation and that's great and there's nothing wrong with that. Um, but I think that what you can do and what you are doing, it show that you can, you can overcome things. You can overcome horrible things. Some of the most horrible experiences a person could ever face. You can overcome them and you have. And those messages, they give people inspiration. And inspiration is one of the greatest things you can give a person and her that you inspiring me today.

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       I told you since this man ever since we started communicating, I told you I meanness. I even went out of my way today to matt. Matt rang me, your producer, and I wanted to make point right away. I said, dude, I know a lot of people climb right past you to go to Joe. I wanted to tell you, thank you for helping me and my family. Thank you for helping organize. I made sure that Jamie got my love when I came in the room because he organized my trip and it was so cool. He got me into the right airport and everything. Right. Because I know that is so important to that man because a lot of people make that effort Gel, and I don't want to be that guy that misses my chance. So I'm gonna thank you. And yes ma'am. And yes, sir, to everyone, like my mom asked me and make sure never to overlook people because that's truly my message.

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       My kindness makes me able to come back. My good heart is made better by the fact that I want to believe in good. And it's crazy how it's come back to reward me in so many ways. Like, do you remember when Muhammad Ali died? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I didn't know anthony some on Donnie. I didn't know his story, but one day I get contacted by a man who's seen the fear of 13 and I learned that he went to university out here and he became a lawyer because of a promise to his mother to be a good person. He goes to the mosque every Friday and becomes close friends with Mohamad a Neko to dinner every night with Mei Mei on Fridays, you know, and he become real close. And he tells me this story how at a young age, Mohammed looks him in the face and says, you're going to be one of the men that carries my message in life.

Speaker 3:          01:06:12       And he's like, I'm 22 what could I possibly have to offer anyone? So he goes through this experience and on the date of Muhammad Ali had approval from the government patent office for this bracelet that says within good there has god. He called me in England where I was the time, and he says, I have a question for you. I saw your film. I learned a lot about you since then. Why aren't you bitter, man? Why are you still willing to believe? And I said, my mother never prayed for anything but good. She always told me that only good there was was an was within God. He said, are you kidding me? Hold on. And he starts sending me this stuff. I didn't know that earlier that day. Muhammad Ali's bracelet would be, you know, approved by the Pat. I didn't know any of that, but it was those words.

Speaker 3:          01:07:05       You see what I mean about the synchronicity of all this craziness of my life. The next thing he know I'm and in Los Angeles, a meeting Alejandro, he wants to help me make the movie. I meet all these wonderful people like Adam and from bottle keeper. He's such a sweet guide. They came up with this company on the beach a couple of years ago and now it's doing very well for keeping drinks cold and he's done wonders for me and my wife. This man is such a lovely guy that I wouldn't be in this chair without him. We're anthony or any of these people. Right. And then anthony sets up may, may Ali, and he brings me out and we have a pod cast and he doesn't tell her word about me beforehand. Now. What's crazy was I'm doing this interview right behind where I used to sleep on the street and I think I kept a lot of quiet, did some of my best work when I was homeless, and I do this thing in May, May, looks at me and says, no disrespect to my father Muhammad Ali, but you're one of the most influential men I ever met my life.

Speaker 3:          01:08:08       And within five minutes of meeting you, I'm already changing things about my life. I decided right then, okay, then I have to own that man I have to live at for her man. Like I can never go back. I can't go back and be an average, retarded, mindless, angry person. I can't be caught up in the drama of everyday stupid shit. Like I got an owe it to that girl, you know? And I have ever since I met her, she's one of the nicest people in my life, man. I have some amazing friends, Joe. I really mean it manna. And there's so many connections to your life you wouldn't even know, dude, when people found out I was coming to meet you. Every one of them said the same. Pretty much the same thing. Joe. Such a nice duty. So intelligent. I love listening to them.

Speaker 3:          01:08:58       I work with educators on a platform code, netplus they love your stem procast I know people up in Waterbury, Connecticut that teach out of the self defense class codes. Practical set defense third right now going crazy. Cause you know they know Joe Jesse, I'm Kazak huskies on the first ballot tour card. You know it and they, these guys are really crazy like Alex core, Cortez and all them. They're like joe is so next level. I'm saying so are you psych joe showing you to believe in yourself because he didn't get there because he had like been handed this shit. Like I remember reading stories about you going to the MMA and just doing it so he could have drink money man. Like the get free tickets and go in. Right. Yeah, that's true in it. Yeah. When I first started working for the UFC, I did the first if not for money. Right. I did the first 15 shows for free. For free. Yeah. See what I mean?

Speaker 2:          01:09:53       Well, it was probably foolish financially. My manager didn't think it was a good idea. I just didn't care. I just, I was enjoying it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:00       That's what I love. Like I, it's what I want to do, man. I want to be the dude. Man

Speaker 2:          01:10:04       was also struggling company that I believed in and I wanted to help him. But what, what you're saying is interesting because you have one theme that you keep repeating, that you want to do things for other people. He keeps saying that like you wanted to do that from May. May you wanted to make me proud. This is a constant theme that you, you want, you want to do good for other people. That's an amazing, amazing mindset for someone who's been through everything that you've been through, that, that sentiment, that, that and then your gratitude. That's another very, very powerful thing. Gratitude, love and gratitude are two of the most incredible expressions and some of the most influential. Because when you showed true gratitude to people and true love to people, they feel that that affects the way they interact with the rest of the people that they're going to experience.

Speaker 2:          01:10:58       Like if they run into a new person, just moments after meeting you, they will be nicer and they will, they will feel that gratitude and feel that love. That's a real, and that's one thing that we all can do. You know, this thought that we're all a powerless and helpless. It's of the problems with there's this society is that the society is so overwhelming. We have so much information coming at us. And the message is that what's important is, you know, beautiful girls with short skirts and fast shiny cars and big giant houses and private jets and diamond rings and Expensive Watches and all this horse shit. And this is what people seek. They seek that instead of seeking love and gratitude because it doesn't seem that that's important, but that's way more important. It's everything because that literally changes the world. It changes. It's like, you know, I always thought that that expression, the wings of the butterfly eventually become a hurricane.

Speaker 2:          01:11:55       That's fucking stupid cause that doesn't work that way. A butterfly just generates a very small amount of wind and they're small and it doesn't really work that way, but the idea behind it, what what it, what it, what it represents as a metaphor is that you literally buy your one person that lives amongst 300 plus million people in this country, one person with love and gratitude and inspiration, especially the way you can express yourself that affects people you come in contact with and that in turn affects the people they come in contact with and that literally can change the world and actually could change the world. That's real necessity, man. That's what I'm good at. I know it. I've helped so many people heal their lives when I've interacted with them and tense time. I've made it. Let me stop you because this is one thing that you said to me before the podcast and you said it again during the podcast.

Speaker 2:          01:12:51       The only want to do this one podcast, you don't want to say anymore. And I want to ask you why. Because if you have this powerful message, the more people you reach and the more you express yourself with this message, you're not going to cheap. And your message, well you're going to do is you're going to get it out to more and more people. And the more people that you can get out your words and the way you express yourself, that's going to affect people. It's going to affect people in a very, very positive way. Okay? But the other side of that, and no one can appreciate is that I'm failed. I haven't been able to get anything going. I tried to start upon, no, no, no, no, no. Let me, let me stop you. Let me stop you. You're not failed. First of all, you've only been out of jail for 13 years.

Speaker 2:          01:13:35       That's fucking crazy. You were in jail for 22 years on death row. There's not a whole lot of people get through that experience and can tie their own fucking shoes after they're done. You know, you, you, you're, you have every right in the world to be shell shocked and incapacitated. You're not, it's hard to get things going that the world does not open its doors for you and success does not come easy. It doesn't work that way. Okay? So for you to say you failed, you haven't failed. You've already written books. You've already have a, a documentary made about you. You're in, in the process of making a feature length film about your life. That's not a failure. No, I just failed getting the platforms

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       together that I need and I guess

Speaker 2:          01:14:15       failing, it's just, it doesn't always work out right the first time. It's not, it's not a failure. You're not a failure.

Speaker 3:          01:14:21       Okay? Then here's the deal for you, sir. Prove your words right to me and come on when I get my shit together. You come on my podcast. When we finished the conversation,

Speaker 2:          01:14:30       later on, I would do that, but even if I didn't, doesn't matter. You can do anything, but wow, I just want to showed you, you yourself, this idea that you're, you've failed is crazy. It's you. You have not failed. If you've done things. First of all, everyone does things that don't succeed and then you recalibrate and you adjust and you try again. No one succeeds and wins the world championship in their first fight. No one writes a book and without learning English and without practicing essays, that becomes the greatest book the world's ever written, read, written, whatever you, you, you, you take time and you learn. This is what life is about. Life is about this process and through that process you find yourself through the difficult tasks that you undertake, maybe adjust and you become better. You said he started a podcast and you feel well, how long did you do it for?

Speaker 3:          01:15:30       I didn't never got off the ground. No one believes in me. And then I know, I'm just saying,

Speaker 2:          01:15:35       first of all, the podcasts are easy, man. What that phone you have right there? I'm sure that phone has a audio recorder I've done by living my $11 phone probably does. Oh, they all do. Every phone does. That's not $11 madness or regular android phone. Right? A good phone. It's one of these wafer these me. And look, if you had this phone fucking 10 years ago that people think you are a wizard. Yeah, man, if he were in the fifth century, of course. Yeah. Well that phone I'm sure has,

Speaker 3:          01:16:07       you know you're kicking me into this, right, and I'm going to have to respond because of the way I've always been wired. I'm going to do this. Then I can do anything. No, listen, I am all right. You need never again encouraged me, sir. Okay. If I go around doing that for others, I have been rough on myself because I thought I'd have a platform and accomplish the things that I wanted to and I felt really shitty that I wasn't able to take care and provide for my family. And that's the heart of it really was the struggle and that side. I wouldn't give a shit about fame. I've had the most amazing experiences of my life, man. One of my first interviews was the village voice and the woman learns me at the end, Jennifer Gonnerman's, she says, man, you know you're living one of the greatest stories ever told man, this ain't no joke.

Speaker 3:          01:16:49       And every time she's told me that words in my head, I realized comes with a hell of a ride in a price. So if I've got to own it, I got to own all of it. I keep telling people to own it when you do well. So maybe I needed to bounce back and this is the day I stepped forward and start kicking ass again. And maybe that will get me out of those tearful that I've had to go through. What do you have every right to have a struggle? I mean if anybody has any right to, to, to have difficult emotions and a difficulty expressing those emotions. It's you. I, and I understand how you could dwell on things not succeeding the way you anticipated one of them too. But he just kind of keep going, man. You know, I'm such a honest person.

Speaker 3:          01:17:32       I could never come on here and fake it. You know, I could never do that for you man. I thought that would be so insincere. So I just came down here and I decided I was, cause it was poured out. Honestly we did. And I feel like the best thing about it is like jelly. Like you're so like me in so many ways on the, on the download, like you just, he's just want good. Like you just want to have a purposeful message that you want to share and that's what I thought was really cool. I had a really cool experience last year. I went to East Germany to speak before company and I met all these Lebanese refugees after meeting navy seals. The dude's on the plane love me man. I built them up for being part of our military system. I made them really respect and honor themselves.

Speaker 3:          01:18:17       Then I was on the streets of Berlin hanging out with these Lebanese refugees and I made them feel so good about this fact that they still believed in each other. So I have some magical ability to go around and touch different groups and my message resonates with people who've been in the military or have been through trauma or not been through trauma. And I have a gift. I know it and I've spoken in some of the most prestigious places and one of them is still to this day, one of the highest honors. I spoke at St John's church in London where a ticket on the Vietnamese monk who marched with Martin Luther King in Selma, Alabama spoke, and he used to be my pen pal on death row. He was the first man that gave me respect when I was on death row and he questioned why I didn't have respect a lot like you're doing for me today.

Speaker 3:          01:19:09       And he taught me to look at myself differently. So I went through a whole one year period of my experiences before I could speak at that church. And when I did, I was absolutely flawless because I knew that my friend was there and he was guiding me. And somewhere within me I have some magical ability. I don't know where it comes from, but I have an order to skill. And once I'm past these dark days, I'm sure I can lay it down well so that I can carry a message beautifully to educational fields purposefully into the corporate fields or wherever I want to go and I love it that I do have a winning hand and I have a gift behind it that was earned, not control yourself. How to do this. I mean think about what you were saying earlier about learning how to speak so that you could speak at your own execution.

Speaker 3:          01:19:59       That's why it's a powerful motivating force. Yes sir. And to learn all of the world's religions so that you understood what it means to speak. Do you know in the Sanskrit religion, a lot of the words are used as descriptive forms of things. So chair isn't the object, it's the feeling of sitting. So you have a responsibility and not only in the words that you choose to speak, but in a manner that you deliver them and the vibrations within you that you carrying leash share with another person because there is a receptor within us all to the truth and it resonates and it rises within us. And so I found that powerful ability to talk to myself in that manner so that I could love myself and I would stand in the wouldn'to of my cell and talk to myself or quote beautiful texts and I loved reading the Prophet I Kahleel Goubran.

Speaker 3:          01:20:55       I read it over 20 times because I thought his message was so powerful because he lost his entire family while he wrote this book over a three year journey and although I might have come back from the ashes like pg Carnahan and the man who beat would be king from Roger Kipling, I still feel like I have a valid message motivating me to go forward. And my idea from this wine on is I want to go home to Laura and the kids and regroup, get myself together and I know a lot of people are going to contact me because of your grace to have me on your show and what I plan to do over the next couple of years, Joe, is I want to show myself not just user that I'm right. Being a kind man. Being a goodhearted man, being meticulously polite doesn't mean you're a loser. It doesn't mean you're a full and if people take advantage of you, it's down to you to take it as an insult or rise the fuck up about the insult and just move past it.

Speaker 3:          01:21:59       The reason I'm not bitter is because I didn't take it personal when they broke my teeth and put me in death row and tortured me. I didn't take it personal because right now there are 2 million people incarcerated in this country. I didn't take it personal because 150 other men got off of death row. That's why I'm able to function because I don't take life personally, but I'd take love personally. I take it so personally to, I'm willing to love myself. A lot of people can't do that. Do you know how hard it is to get a woman to look at herself without looking at a fall they can't stand? Do you know how hard it is to get a man? To be honest with his emotions, thinking that he's weak? If he does, I would rather have tears on my face walking down the street and frustration. Then just rip on somebody and hurt somebody. That's the kind of caliber of level of humanity I want to find them myself. And I think we all do. And I think the message, like you said, has been distorted by the social media so badly that we need more talking. And I would all, I would dream of having a late night talk and

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       play some of my calls, music and talk to people, just average people and just open it up. Like I want to just share what's good about me because my mother was right. Wouldn't have just been a terrible waste of time if I got out of jail and I was just another asshole on the street, it would, you know, one of the things that keeps coming up is you are longing for community. And this is something that I've been thinking about a lot lately because I think one of the things that people are constantly searching for in this world is happiness, right? So one thing that people don't have that they wish they had that comes up over and over again. It's a reoccurring theme and one of the things that's also a big part of this life that we are all are living right now is this very recent disconnect between our neighbors, our friends, by commuting to work and it's being stuck in this stuffy environment where you can express yourself normally and this is the majority of your life, the majority of your time.

Speaker 2:          01:24:13       And then we wonder why we're sad and we don't spend enough time together with friends. Here's, here's when you aren't sad. When you're having fun with your friends because that's what human beings are meant to do. There's some, they're meant to work together to do something together like something meaningful core of your healing. It's meant we're meant to have community or meant to have friends and we're meant to laugh. We'll meant to share experiences were meant to care for each other and when that's not happening in your life, you feel like shit. What you're doing is spreading the fingers of your community. You're spreading the branches of your community by, by expressing yourself and helping other people, by expressing yourself and inspiring other people by sending your message out there. This is a type of community for people that are longing for community. You're connecting with people, people that are longing to feel a connection.

Speaker 2:          01:25:05       And this is, this is something that's missing. Is this something that's greatly missing in our society? And you, you understand it more than most because your time that they forced you to be separate from community that they did. They gave you the opposite of community. If you communicated, they beat you up, they gave you the opposite of the community. They locked you in a cage, didn't let you mingle with other people, and then the people that were around you, you didn't want to mingle with them. Horrific people that are just the worst examples of a life gone wrong and you're surrounded with them. You still emerged. And that just, that alone gives people hope. And that hope is something that everybody needs is a good person on death row. To the point that, uh, a man named Tom Lowenstein wanted to write a book about me and I turned them on to water oh, Grad, who's still sitting on death row. And I asked them to write the book about Walter. And then CNN death row stories wanted to me and have Susan's

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       friend and narrate my story. Two and a half years ago, I told him again, water still on death row, man, do for him. Now what's Walter Store that Walter was? Walter, oh, grab was convicted of killing a little girl and put her in a TV box, but he didn't do it. And he had the misfortune of having his brother attacked in his house and nearly murdered and being brought in for that investigation. And then simply asked by detective, hey, there's a girl killed on your street. Did you know anything about it? He goes, yeah, I know about it. Next thing you know, he's facing death row. So a jury finds him not guilty, but before the sabotage of one juror, he ends up on death row. When the SEC sabotage of one juror, he voted not guilty. And then he'd products out during the vault. Dare, I lied, I lied.

Speaker 3:          01:26:48       He's a, he's guilty. So they declare a mistrial. Get the guy, they called him on senior to come in and say that now he confessed to him, they have a second trial. So they put all their on death row and I meet him and everybody's abusing shit out of him. So I did the unnatural thing. I stood up for him for all the bullies and I told the two men that were abusing them if they put their hands on him again, I was going to get involved. And I started helping Walter with his lawyers. And ever since I got out of prison, I kept my word to stick by them and fight for him. So I gave up opportunities, could have changed my life. And now death row stories is back and they're going to do my story. And Walter is still on death row right now.

Speaker 3:          01:27:30       Yeah. And he's innocent. And what can be done to help walter contact Tom Wolfe and ask him why the innocence projects and the and integrity units won't take up his case. There's no evidence. And uh, it was clearly, I mean when you see the show on a death row stories, it's just laid out so clear. I was a little disappointed they didn't mention me that I turned them on to Walter Myself. Selfless sac was overlooked but that was just my ego. But I always am like that and that's what I love. I know that they were despicable joe and the acts that a lot of men did word spectacle, but if I let that stop me from loving any of them than I was going to be nothing. So yeah, a lot of them were really messed up man. But the ones that needed it, I set aside everything and still cared about men.

Speaker 3:          01:28:17       So spell out Walter's name for [inaudible], g R. O D. O. Grodd Walter. Oh Greg was convicted of putting a little girl in a box and Philadelphia, we need to get Kim Kardashian on the case. Yeah man. Cause this is she's, she's getting people released from prison. Kim, if you want to get someone a, uh, a pardon. It's Walter. This man has suffered enormously. People prison. Is he in? He's in Greene County, Super Maxim and pence, Pennsylvania. I fought for my other friend Walt, Ernie Simmons. He got out here the trials of Walter Al Grod, shocking murder, so-called confessions and notorious snitch to send a man to death row. Tom Lowenstein came to me while I was still on death row in 2002 and he said, nick, my God, your story, I want to write a book about you. And I said, you, that's brilliant. But how about the guy sitting next to me? It doesn't have lawyers or DNA or anybody to help him.

Speaker 3:          01:29:12       How about helping him? He goes, are you crazy? You're given up an opportunity. I said, dude, it ain't like that. I love this man. He has no lawyers like I do. So that's the pattern. That's who I am. So I didn't take credit for it, but I really did try to help another man because I felt like I would be so disappointing if I just took and took and took for myself and you know, I'm actually grateful I didn't go on your podcast two years ago. I was a homeless person without a family and now I got the two amazing girls, Sara and Bethany and my wife Laura. These two English girls get the dream life change. They get to move from Somerset, England out here to Oregon and my little girl gets on a yellow school bus show. She goes the bus every day.

Speaker 3:          01:30:01       She's in school. They, they like, I'm in the community. I got all these wonderful friends up in Oregon, like Donnie Hobbs and these guys that are my personal friends now. I built my community again, like I got all these cool people up there that love me. I, my wife's right now in Salem with her friend carly, and they're opening up a new shop up there and all this stuff. So I really did it despite not having anything. I did exactly what you said. I went and overcame the debt probation and found community and built my tribe. Look, I know a lot of people s a struggle to have people in their life that aren't causing conflict. It's you is allowing it, man, go out and find new people to be around. Cause a lot of people want you if you're a nice person. It's just hard for me

Speaker 2:          01:30:45       people to find those people sometimes and that's where they lose hope. You know, people that don't and one of the things they did it, they don't know where to get started, right? They don't know how to, how to get their life going, how to get moving, how to feel good, how to get success. There's so many different things. And um, to those people I say just do something. The more things you do, the more things you can do. Do something, do anything. Whether it's commit to walking around the block 10 times a night with whether it's a committing to writing your life story

Speaker 3:          01:31:18       and you knew it stops a lot of people is their self imagery. Right? [inaudible] I, I was convicted of a rape and murder, and in everyone's eyes, I was a psychologically deranged person. I had to live with that stigma everyday. Right? Then when I got out, everybody thought I must be crazy as fuck because I spent 8,057 days in solitary confinement being tortured. So there's no way I could be saying, right, right. Their perspective had no effect on me because by that time I'd given myself enough education to know the difference between what was done to me and who I am. And this is the problem with a lot of people. They fail to stop doing this thing where I am this or I am that and this is the problem. So I really have never cared about the perspective of anyone in the negative except for when they got it wrong, from my intent to do good with them.

Speaker 3:          01:32:19       And then it just became a battle of my own ego. So I realized that the truth is, as long as I know I'm doing right and I'm doing good, it isn't going to matter about their perspective because the same person who thought I was a rapist, scumbag murderer now thinks I'm one of the most eloquent speakers they met in their life. Their perspective about me changed, but mine surely shouldn't, but it did. And that's what a lot of people suffer from. They let that negative comment make them feel like they have to overcome it or have to live with it. And I'll tell you what, Joe, I really never expected this, but for the first time in my life from conducting an interview throughout the whole process, I've been reevaluating who I am and what I'm saying. It's like a fucking slap in the face, man.

Speaker 3:          01:33:01       Like I came in here, the drag world with my emotions, carrying him on my sleeves and all the stress. I haven't slept well for days. I haven't taken care of us. That's bullshit. I didn't do well in articulating and you gave me a wake up call that I have never had before. In any experience, you can go back and look through the history of the many experiences of ahead of interviews and I've done some outstanding ones. I've never had a personal experience where throughout the course of speaking of another man, I started to reevaluate everything I held firmly to, and I promise you I'm going to go and think a whole lot about this and get my shit together because I do owe it to allow to people to be one bad ass motherfucker with a hell of a message to yourself. Damn straight, man.

Speaker 3:          01:33:47       I'm going to do that. I really am an so if you want me to come and speak before your corporate functions, if we're a high school or university, I do that better than anyone. In fact, I'm fine. One of the finest speakers on the planet, and I learned it because I watched Bruce springsteen. You remember that speech he gave at the Oscars for Philadelphia? No, I never watched the Oscars. Dude, get that up. My God. Bruce springsteen is one of the finest speakers. No, but just the image. But dude gave one of the most profound speeches I ever waste. Beautiful Girl. He made the nexus point between music and imagery. So poignant that I was blown away by it. So much so that when we made the documentary fear of 13, that's all I'd kept imagining when I spoke was the imagery we would be lended. And I love the fact that I worked very hard to bring the whole audience into my cell one time to spend with me my story in a way that no one ever did before and I fucking rocked it.

Speaker 3:          01:34:54       That's awesome. Yeah, I liked that. I liked the fact that I know I have talent in that field. I don't want to boast, but I have a gift and it King uh, light years ahead of me. When I watched, I had 400 students in ealing enraptured at a conference. My friend at educator named Emma Dopson set this whole thing up. So go there, you could hear a pin drop because all along, somewhere along the way, an energy clicks in and I can hold a room in palm of my hand. I've had some amazing experiences with it. I don't know how to stay at, but that cult of personality lure of being on the stage and talking to people is powerful man. And I can see why Tony Robbins and everybody gets up in nine eight Dudette I'm not a life coach. I can't coach no one's life.

Speaker 3:          01:35:54       But I can tell you about your life and ma in ways that would make you really invigorated to want to make a better life for yourself, but no one could truly be your life coach. You got to do that shit yourself. And I love it. I love it that I understood those moments because one of the coolest things was I used to go to the globe theater. Anybody did understand Shakespeare understands the globe. Theater is the center of the world for Shakespeare. They would perform titus andronicus and then after which Cleopatra would come out on stage and introduced me to the Carl. Now I had eight minutes, 10 minutes tops to do this thing and in eight to 10 minutes I had a crowd who had been spanning for three hours long play crying, putting money in a bucket for what I said to them and did it flawlessly every time.

Speaker 3:          01:36:48       And I did it for a whole summer in London. It was the most amazing experience to stand there and look out over this vista of London after you did this amazing thing where people never expect that you and you are nothing to do with the theater. You are just a human rights charity chosen by the theater to come out and speak. And I, I realized that that moment I had a gift. If I could get people who have been standing for three hours watching a play to have wet tears in her eyes, putting money, shoving it into a bucket for me than I knew I had some ability to finally speak. I was no longer an aphasia effected, destroyed, distorted mine, addled by drugs and used beyond belief to distortions of like I was so screwed up to come back to do that. I knew I was, do you know I wrote this whole book in only three days.

Speaker 3:          01:37:40       Wow. 200 and I have a gift Joe. Like seriously, like I wrote and I have witnesses. I wrote the whole book in two and a half days man. Cause it was in me. This story monsters med mum was so powerful that when I met Laura, my wife, I told her, I said, you know what? I'm a finally do it man. I'm gonna get this out. And it, it just came out for two and a half days. I barely slept, ate, did anything. All I did was make love to my wife on a break or right. And I mean poured it out and I poured out the whole book and I've realized that was needed to move on. And it's, it's the best book I ever wrote my life. And I'm so proud that it's my last one because I don't have to worry about no more stories.

Speaker 3:          01:38:27       I did the thing that was great. All right, so this one changed. This is really fear of 13 my countdown to execution, it went through hell. It got canceled. It's now fear of 13 then I wrote the kindness approach. I did one called my journey through her eyes. I didn't bring a copy as you, wait a minute. Do you not want to write? Like why? Why do you say that? I hope it doesn't because I crafted my series of books that create and captivate my whole entire message. Right? And I want to leave it pure. I don't want to then go on and make up a falsifications of things that didn't happen. So all these are nonfiction. All these are nonfiction. All these events are true and points in my life and I think that's the best thing to do. Stay true to who I am.

Speaker 3:          01:39:13       I was going to tell one story called, that's enough for me as a fictionalized writer just to show everybody my talent because people in the past that said, wow, you can write anything. So I was going to do that, but I've held back because I thought I want to leave it. Cool. I want to leave it like, this is my series of work. My work is I wrote to prison books and I wrote two books that will guide people in life, how not to be screwed up or bitter. And I want to leave that as my message. I want to go and do other things, but those are my books and I'm proud of the work I did. I got it out of my system. I'm a published author. I can go down in history. Is that right? I'm cool with that. I don't really want to then push it and think that I can then lower people into reading more works than I'd can try because that's not really fair to them.

Speaker 3:          01:40:02       Do you know what I mean? I, I want to keep it that way. I think that's one of the things I want to try and stay true to. Now, speaking as my love now, negative, someone wants to hire you to speak, where would they go? Nick Harris. Dot Org. So it's really simple. Um, everyone on the podcast can easily find me on the other social medias. But I have, like I said, my really close friends, Adam, uh, Callahan and his wife just had a baby so that everyone in my website, [inaudible] dot org and a lot of people can reach me for functions like that. But I really love the fact that I have a chance to also with this my vs. Dot com to go ahead and go into schools. And there's a really cool thing, you know, this x generation times three men, they're like so computer savvy, right?

Speaker 3:          01:40:48       So much so that you actually are starting a trend. There's no longer 15 minutes of fame. There's the five second video clip of fame now and has been reduced. It's just like everything's five seconds, you know what I mean? It's no longer, so everything in the education field is coming to us faster and faster. So we need to use the analytics of something like my verse to go ahead and get a child to figure out who they can go and be in their careers and then follow that correct path. You can't just throw it against the wall anymore, Joe. You have to really work hard to get children to feel good about being a taxi driver, a painter. You know, it's not no shame to be a a person who goes out and does a simple manual job, if that makes you happy as a human being, you should be able to do that without the stigma, right?

Speaker 3:          01:41:35       But the school's not going to tell you that. You know, they're going to tell you you could be anything, but why wouldn't you want to find out what would make you happy in life and be that right? That makes sense to me. So not going to learn that from school. Now learn that from people, from people, and you'll learn that from, from online more than anything today. And that's why I want to be involved in the educational field. I think that's my greatest gift of someone who went to prison, who hadn't ever read a book, who accomplished the things that he did. Then can share how the purpose of my education was. So did I, was able to process life enough to handle it. To give myself enough separation to realize who I was as a human being is not the sum total of my misery and that I could then help others structured their lives through politeness to go and get a good education.

Speaker 3:          01:42:27       And I love that fact that I worked so hard through all these different things to not lose that message. Men. And it really does work for a lot of young people. They find that there's self restrict, uh, respect really does grow when someone gives them just a small little bit of a break. Man, they're so honest. I love, I love it. I'll never tire of it in that one regard because I've touched so many young people's lives. Man. That's beautiful. That's a great message. And uh, thanks for being here man. I really appreciate it. I'm glad we did this. Yeah, me too. I really do. Can I give a quick shot at this? So I got some good friends of mine. I'd, I really messed up on Alex Ortiz and uh, I like these young dudes, these fighters joke, they're all mad about you. And I like it.

Speaker 3:          01:43:13       What do you think about the Bella tour anyway? I love it. Yeah, we'll need more. We need more organizations like that, but I think Bella tours doing a great job. Yeah. Jesse Casa Kosky. He's gonna fight this Mofo bear. And I like the fact that his father teaches that coon Tao with that prison style of martial arts. I don't know what that is. Oh, well it's the old style. It's like, um, it isn't like the martial arts that most people would know because it's derived from the Filipino prison systems. It's like really pure solves of quick attacks and stuff like that. So as soon as in the boxing, but now I like it that like dudes, I've got Mike Campbell and all these guys have been really supportive to me and everyone, like I said, that knew I was coming on here. I just want to tell them if I forgot who you are.

Speaker 3:          01:43:56       Thank you all for being so supportive. And I really want to say thank you to my wife for being so therefore me lately, and I'm really grateful that we've learned in this wonderful lesson that I might belong to you, sweetheart, but I also have some good left to do and I'm gonna try and do both well, and I'm very grateful to everyone. Listen, especially to you, Mister broken. You're really nice young man. Thanks man. I'm grateful to you as well. Now I'd mean that Joe and I know you're going to do, he said on a nice young man like you're my grandma. You're a nice young man. A even better. I'm your sexy granddad. Give me some love, boy. Thank you. Go and have a good day. Or we want to love your round the world by, by, by Martin Mooc. How man. Bye Bye. Bye Bye everybody.
