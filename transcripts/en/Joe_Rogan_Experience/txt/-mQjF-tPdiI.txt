Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       and we live. Yeah. What are you doing over there, Joey? Just looking at your book. I've been reading that book lately. This message one, which one I even talked about on the podcast, the war of art resistance. So now I catch myself every time I'm. I want to do something. I catch myself. I've been practicing for look at the resistance levels that comes up like different things I need to do. I want to see what excuse I get myself. Yeah, yeah. It's a normal thing, right? Normal Ms dot white brother. Very nice to meet you. Coming down here man. I hear the fantastic things about you from Joey, from other people. So Joey insisted. He's like, you've got to get this guy in. He had dog. He's a fucking wizard. What he did for my shoulders. What? What did he do for your shoulders? You know, I've been going to Alberto.

Speaker 2:          00:00:56       Alberto Alberto cranes is the man in Burbank for tactical fitness. Right? They do it in the mornings in the afternoon, but the one kid coach Robert, you know, after class he would say, Joe, what are you gonna do you gonna go home or you want to do this for a little while and at first or first two weeks the movements were difficult, but then, you know, level one stuff, man, any age could do it. If I could do it. Just laying on the back, lifting your hips and spending over on your toes and doing it back. And at first I couldn't even look Joe. I couldn't move my elbows like that. Nothing. My shoulders, my wrists, and I kept staying for the 30 minute thing. Five exercises, three minutes apiece. That's it. No drama. You could be big, heavy. It's all stuff I could do. Picking up your leg, putting it on body weight or body weight, stuff that I can handle.

Speaker 2:          00:01:51       If I can handle it on my risk being 300 pounds, anybody can handle it. Simple stuff. And one day I was getting caught and like, uh, the guy was pulling me into his guard and magically my hips flew up and I just mysteriously gotten to site control and I, something made me look up and Alberto cranes jaw dropped and he goes, that's from doing that stuff. You couldn't do that when you walked in here. But I kept going to these 30 minute things. Thirty minute five exercises, three minutes. You're out of there at 1:45. So it was this a, uh, like a. do you have like a system that you bring to a bunch of different places and you have a affiliates? Is that work? I'm going us right up to you. Alright, sorry. I suppose that for me. Have you ever done a podcast? You speak fantastic English for someone who's from Italy, right? Thanks. I believe in. I lived here years ago, years ago, got married years ago. Spent some time, be careful. Trump might kick you out now. You got to be super careful. I already been out back in Europe. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I'm representing this system has been by Asana.

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       Oh Scott. Simon. So it's like

Speaker 4:          00:03:03       cloud that CSD, uh, we meet each other a long time ago in [inaudible] 94 and then, um, I was doing contractor work that's worth my time of businesses design. I've always been involved in training martial art and any kind of training and that, you know, or the injury that got for competing and normal weight lifting and I'd been lost contact with him for a few years and then I saw him in 2000 and coming out with the clubbers club has really attracted me. It was a different tools and I say, okay, I want, I, I'll give you bake in concert with these guys. I want to understand how can they, can help it. So I went back to him and he blew my mind, blew my mind and helped me to get back into the best shape of my life. You know, I feel now in 47 feet I can move better and do better than I used to do it when I was 20.

Speaker 4:          00:03:53       So I promised him, you know, I'm going to make these things happen in Europe or you want me, my coach, you changed my fee, my way to see fitness and I got to do that. So between my job and security I was introducing this to my teams, to my teams and then I see changing on people, people being able even to just to go, moving easier, you know, and then transfer to whatever it was, our training and Ghana or wherever skiers and stop everything was easier. So I start to believe, start to believe basically, and I start to say, okay, I want to help more people that I can in my line of duty in the army because I still don't have a different contract as a consultant in the army. Back home has a physical trainer and some time out. So non combat training and I start to introduce these things from barely cry because the system is very complex as they were. Joe was talking about is all the mobility.

Speaker 3:          00:04:49       Yeah. Mobility is a big. It's a big factor because there's for so long, people have just been concentrating on getting stronger or getting in great shape, but I, you know, I know people that are in fantastic shape, they can run forever, but they could barely touch their toes and you, you, you developed these bodies that are severely limited in the amount of motion that you can actually get out of your body in certain motions. You're really good. You know, you could, you might be explosive with a bench press, you might, you might have a great run, but whatever else you're doing to your body, you're compromising all of your overall mobility. So over the last few years has been a tremendous amount of concentration and effort by a bunch of different trainers. Kelly start, he's a. he's done a lot. Kelly's done a lot of work and his book becoming a supple Leopard. Excellent book on that and Kelly has a great instagram you can follow to and what he's done is he's done an amazing job in highlighting mobility and how important mobility and just having a full range of motion, which seems so simple, but it's not something that most people really concentrate on. Most people are concentrating on getting stronger, more deadlift, more bench press, more this, more that, but you're compromising all of these different areas. Your body absolutely

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       agree with you. That's, that's from the right, right there. This ball, that ball right there is the um, it's, it's one of those, I think he calls it the Wad. Supernova. Supernovas. So I got that one too. It seems like nothing. But when you roll around and find this spot, release tension on your Fascia. Yeah, put that on the ground. And I do like bridges on it. I lie on my back on it and I put all my weight on that ball for people just listening. It's a rubber ball that's like the size of a softball and it's really hard and it's got like this textured outer surface. And Kelly developed this to, uh, to help you. He also uses lacrosse balls. That's what I start out with. But then I think that's a little bit better than a Lacrosse ball. I take one of those everywhere with me on the road.

Speaker 5:          00:06:43       Every time I go in a hotel room that goes in my bag period. Like there's no. Because if I work out I get stiff. If I got something locked up, I need that fucking thing. That's what I have to in my bag because it will to travel and flight flight. My deaf friends being back, my lower back have the same problem. I find those links. Went to St. Yeah. Like say Joe, what is the bodies were the things years ago to take a unit of my community, you know, working with the army or stuff like that. They say, oh, we're going to do mobility. They will look at you like, do we really need that? You know, the old tough guy, you know, the old thinking about need something to get myself stronger and faster. Yeah. But they don't get it. They don't get a few who don't allow yourself to regain their mobility.

Speaker 5:          00:07:28       Yes. They used to push to have. At one point you're going to be stuck. You're going to be reaching blood door, you're going to get injured and you're going to lose those guys in the field. That was my point and I think the system that this got created was smart enough to say, you know what? I got introduced this slowly underneath because they give you this amount of mobility that I w what you want when you want to have that intensity workout, okay, should I give you that I intend to do about that doctorate, I intensity, but you're going to teach you how to recover for the poor performance faster, and then I get introduced to Libya of Yoga, so you're gonna. Feel better. Loosen up when you live in and day by day, those guys, they on understood and they started telling me, you know what?

Speaker 5:          00:08:08       We like the workout, but what we feel we need to be able to move the shoot that again, to be able to carry a backpack again and now everybody wants to do mobility more than workout because you can kill yourself in the workout. You don't even need to kill. You just throw the days and decide to be a push up and that they don't need to really someone to drive you. Here. People are understanding now that it's a. it's a huge deal and yoga is huge. For me. That's one of the reasons why I still use that Supernova ball, but man, Yoga has had a tremendous effect on my back. Is that a tremendous effects on everything? My overall flexibility is better than it's been in a long time since I was a kid and I just feel better. Just feels like everything moves better, you know? But you say yoga to and they go, ah,

Speaker 6:          00:08:56       you fucking pussy. How come they're doing dead lifts? You need to do fucking hill sprints. You know, everybody wants to do something that looks like tough guy. Stuff that looks awesome on your instagram. You know, everybody wants to do dead lifts for fucking full of 50, but the reality is if your body has any weak links, yoga, we'll find those links, show it, show it right away. I was shocked like, you know what the big one for me was my feet and then this is something that nick curse onset as well. Nick [inaudible], who is a really well respected strength and conditioning coach, a speed of sport down in, uh, I think he's in Huntington beach somewhere in Orange County, but he trains a Joe Schilling Hoffeld dos Anjos, Fabrizio, Verdugo pick time, MMA fighters and kick boxers and works with Aaron Peko was a top level wrestler and just a long line of like real high level combat sports athletes.

Speaker 6:          00:09:49       And I asked him, I go, what do you think that the one thing that a lot of athletes have that is something they need to improve on? He said, feet strength. Nobody says that. Nobody says that. Everybody's like, work on your cardio, work on your explosiveness. You got to be able to, you know, fucking throw more kettle bells around. He was like, your feet, like you think about it, your emotion, like if you can't move out of the way or towards your opponent, you're useless. Right? If your foot's broken in a fight, you're severely limited and one of the things that I found out almost instantly when I started doing yoga and when I started skiing, my fucking feet would be killing me in the beginning. Skiing was because my boots were too small because I have really wide feet so my feet would be smashed in there and it sucked and I was like, well fuck skiing.

Speaker 6:          00:10:33       I can't do it. My feet are too wide. Then I got boots that are made for a wider feet and they fit, but my feet would still hurt. After awhile I was like, what the fuck is wrong with my damn feet? Maybe it's just because my feet are flat and I'm just going to have to deal with that. No. As soon as I started doing yoga, now I can ski all day. It doesn't bother me at all. As long as I'm doing yoga twice a week, all that foot problems are gone. They're out the window because a balance. It's pretty funny because I was watching you flow video the other night right before I came on because I didn't have. I wanted to be able to contribute in this conversation. You guys are to level genius for me, so if you want just flow video. The first thing he put on some shoes with toes with them and you're talking about the feet. That's before you do anything. He started stretching his feet and I could see him playing with his toes and I'm like, you know, I guess this is the. I think it was going to say and it's saying this, but this has got to be just pulled around and be great.

Speaker 4:          00:11:28       Is there anything. You know what I mean? Everything. Everybody don't think about it because we stand in our fit so we think we're connected to the earth. We are not. We just post this one on the table but he's not connected and move around, but it has no control. We're building the capability to grow, grabbing the ground, understand the stability of the food, the mobility of the tours, and the ankle mobility is mandatory because I'm going to transfer power through my fit engagement to the

Speaker 6:          00:11:54       ground, to my leg, drive to my hips to enter my core. So everything comes from the hurt. These shoes make everybody look gay. Uh, yeah man. There's no way around the shoes. I love them. They're very functional, but they're not sexy at all. I will never get married with us. Well, I always know the real weirdos when I catch them out at night and they're wearing them, you know, if you catch a guy like at a bar and he's wearing those shoes, that's a real weirdo. But there's people that do wear though. Is that your gym? What gym is that? My exec said Jim. Yeah. As the gym that I'm dealing with, I'm working with in Europe. That's the, that's my headquarters say in Europe. So it's a, it's my dream. So this is all what we're looking at here. What's the name of this video?

Speaker 6:          00:12:36       Jamie? Flow fit, flow, fit, tactic. Flow fit. Alberto. Gutsy. Vibram five fingers, so you sponsored by Vibram or I'm an. I'm an ambassador for them and I'm a and that's a very low profile one. It has a very small amount of tread at the bottom of it. Right. It's very thin. The one that you've got on because there are different, different type, different types. Some of them are for trail running. I tried to work with them to, to, to realize something specifically for flow because sometime when they have uber on the side. Yeah, so specifically flow. Especially if we want to focus on your knee and understanding of my knee and my hips work, they get too much friction. So why do you use that instead of a barefoot? I go, I have to donate it. Like you felt you wanted to really go freestyle and move around.

Speaker 6:          00:13:24       You know, I go freestyle go barefoot, but food, there's no traction but some. But it's, you know, if I train them like a Doosan time in the concrete, I need somebody to really protect them in dirt and rocks and stuff. Like that. Years ago you told me one of your biggest failures was getting old and feeling weak, you know, and then you and I traveled a lot together. A lot of places. We would go to Jujitsu places and we'd see the Jujitsu Guy, the main guy, and he'd be walking a little funny. Yeah, they're all fucked up or he be. And that always stuck out, stuck out in my mind like why love something so much in my sixties, I'm going to be limping or walking different and I think this is maybe the so help. That definitely helped that I think. Yeah, that's one of the reasons why it has gotten so into yoga too and he's doing yoga three times a week now and he realizes that after he had back surgery, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          00:14:18       Once you, when people get older in particular, you start realizing the limitations of some of the things that you're doing. You're putting tremendous stress on your body in very specific areas, especially Jujitsu. You're attacking the joints all the time. You're attacking the joints, you're attacking your neck and almost everybody that I know either has a back problem or some sort of a knee problem or a neck problem. It's just a constant issue when it comes to Jujitsu and I feel like the only way to mitigate that as first of all roll with people that you know, like people that you know, they're good people. They're not going to try to hurt you. They're not crazy. It's not even their fault, but young people in could get like some

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       young 20 year old kid is all full of fucking just come and just some little animal they want to kill. They want to kill a young guy. When they roll, they roll fucking full clip and you you could get a knee caught in a scramble and it gets ripped apart. It's a super common, so you gotta be real careful. The kind of people you work out with, make sure that people aren't gonna Yank on an arm bar, a knee bar, he'll hook or something like that. That's big, but also I think that improving your mobility, like dude, there's so many times. I would go to class and I would be stiff before I walked in the door right before I walked in the door. My back would be fucked up. I'd get more up in the morning. My back would be just be stiff and then it get in there and start warming up.

Speaker 3:          00:15:33       But Jujitsu, so fun. As soon as you get in there, you just do a little few movements. He started coming in on flammatory, so you ready to go? Next thing you know, you'll like slap hands and you fucking go into Oregon and then you got a worse back. Then you've got a worse name. That's how I fucked up my back. I didn't just fuck it up in one thing. If I had. That was one incident that had got injured in, I could have eventually healed it. What I did was I just kept doing it. Even when I was still hurt. I would keep God, God just go light. I never went light. Still go back in there and go hard again and then fucks it up more. It's. I think that we have to be super aware that our body is a precious resource and you got to treat it almost scientifically instead of looking at it like, you know, guys like to do curls and bench presses because I mean, how many times have you seen that where you see a guy with a meatball upper body with little toothpick at the bottom that's holding them up with his legs.

Speaker 3:          00:16:29       Like you see guys are certain guys you see at the gym and you go, you poor bastard. Like what are you doing to yourself? Like you think everything looks good. He's got these big biceps and big chest, but your lower body is virtually useless, you know, because they don't live. They don't live with their lower body. They don't do anything with it. You don't. She got to treat your body like, like it's a big old science project. You know, like the. You have to look at it scientifically. What I. When people ask me, what do you think? You know what I think, what is the project that I'm not going to train you? I'm thinking, oh, it was that everybody of us, we know what is our point b. So if I asked you when you come to the gym, what is Yoga? Most of the, especially young people, they know I want to be.

Speaker 3:          00:17:09       Nobody's my point be I want to become a foster, a stronger leaner, whatever you say, point b, point a to point B. Yeah. We don't really know what is our point a, we think we know what we don't know. We don't know what's going on inside our truck about estrogen and testosterone and cortisol, whatever. We don't know exactly over the Fascia has asked me to set up with us. If you don't think about that, we never going to reach point and oh probably we're going to reach it, but going zigzag instead to go straight line and we're going to face in what injury plateau. Back to the, you know, imbalances imbalances. So that's why I think the difficult. Something like yoga is very important. It highlights those

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       imbalances. It seems like this kind of particular motion, like your flow like that up there. That would also highlight those particular modules. I see. I see flow like for me at the beginning of everything. Why? Because you go through the lab or joint mobility and then you start to connect to exercise logically and connected to what challenges your breathing so you're breathing will tell you exactly when you're forcing your brain to some of the moment. You should start to understand the investigative. Why do I force through this range of motion? Probably something is stiff for me. Maybe my giant might be my Fascia. Whatever it does allow me to flow through one one to the other moment because I'm working six degree. I don't just work in their life, a yoga mat up and down, left and right and just to roll jumper score to wherever is my body she supposed to be doing.

Speaker 4:          00:18:35       I look like, like if you know the magic guys picture for me, the message guy, Peter, the one that you look and then you step back and the guy picture. For me, it's the body. You know when I see you standing or do a couple of moment, I can interpret that yourself a little bit, but when you move freestyle, now I can understand exactly what what's going on with you. Do you drop your knee when you score 10 and do a. You know you don't do. Your feet is not connected. You cannot talk your knee when you. You can know even understanding loading one side, you need lateral power in order to wildlife, to the other. So for information, that's for me as a coach, okay, I start to plan out what should be doing or kind of exercise. What kind of strength training maybe is neither for you more stability or more more yoga because until you are already, I wouldn't know like Chula lift to load your body if your body's not able to in your own way.

Speaker 3:          00:19:23       Well that's the thing. Most people don't know what their body's capable of doing like and there's a lot of people that walk into any kind of a classmate start working out and they might not even know what deficiencies they have because they've been overcompensating for that. Or compensating, you know, you might have something wrong with your hip and because of that it's putting extra pressures on your knee or you know, one side might be over. That's one thing that you see with a lot of people that have done very specific sports, like they're very strong on one side and then the other side of their body is weak and when you do that, you create these imbalances. You can get some serious injuries because

Speaker 4:          00:19:54       of that. So we take it for granted. The time you say, okay, I wish my shoulder is in pain, but when I, when I trade, no good, it's already the senior, you know, you're training what you're going to do. Are you going to release the adrenaline and cortisol and that. Those are painkiller that they are supposed to make you stronger. You know, fight in the freezer, fight situation. That's what is the endocrine system is doing to you. But after your training, you got even worse than you to understand that there's a coach. You should be saying, now what? We need to fix that because it's no good that you start training and working into the pain because you were going to create more raw material. There is no neither into your body and for me it's like holding this bottle doesn't wait nothing today, tomorrow, but if I order for one hour, this becoming heavy so we adapt to this kind of similar and they didn't change the level of the water in my butter, but day after day is going to kill me, but people don't understand because they say, oh, I'm used to.

Speaker 4:          00:20:46       I used to do, don't sleep.

Speaker 6:          00:20:48       Used to do, don't eat enough. I'm used to to, to work in this pain. That's not going to happen now. What do you think is the biggest injury that you deal with when you have clients or people that you're working out with? What's the most common as it shoulder, shoulder and the shoulder? More common those days, especially because we, we become, we all grew up in the era that we all want to, you know, pack and a stroller. Now press presses and I believe our shoulders are complex joint, but it's not strong at all because we were vertical animal, not like chimpanzees. The destructor is holding back. The horse can hold a lot of power in the shoulder, the human, be sure that it's just dropping on the ribcage, so awake and then simple question is, are many of us can even stand, just stand standing on the wall with the feet on the wall.

Speaker 6:          00:21:35       Some people that can even hold their weight, give me. You're saying to do handstands, just even simple like that and how many people, even with the fit and the world can do an instant press. Yeah. Not that many. And if you ask how many of you, 10 or 10 out of 10 got shoulder injury probably denied. They say, yeah, I've got an issue since I've been in school. So wic is very complex. A lot of tendons and ligaments, multiple joints. Do you incorporate a lot of hanging? Um, I think hanging is something that people have been really concentrating on over the last few years for shoulder mobility and alleviating impingements absolutely. And people listening to this, if you have anything going on with your shoulder, some talent, you grab a chin up bar and hanging from that thing and just relaxes your shoulder. It stretches out your joints and there's several doctors that stopped doing shoulder surgeries and to alleviate pain they've started doing hanging exercises and prescribing hanging exercises.

Speaker 6:          00:22:31       It's amazing. Just grab a chin up bar. Start hanging from that soccer history though. He has the with the class structure 12, but I got 11. It's not like a formula. The class I go back to the jump rope and just to get oxygen power so I don't pass out. But Alberto come back, they're like 11, 15 and give me homework assignments and they're always different. Joe, like some days it's a steel club. Sundays I'm just working on my hands and knees and we incorporate our hips, but some days he puts me on rings. He goes, you got rings at Your House, Wrangler mastics rings. I go, what wall is going to hold me? I mean, he's got the whole thing and he just taught me one thing too, because my biggest weakness is my breathing from the sleep apnea. Like I even got hypnotized. I mean, I got to go tomorrow, yet you got hypnotized, been going to get hypnotized. What's going on with the sleep apnea? You ever wake up with your pants down? No, no, no. I got it. Got So severe minds is such a bad case from my machine broke a couple of weeks ago. My wife had to go pick up the machine for me up in Logan. The guy was saying, how's Joey doing? You know? And he goes, you know, that til this day, Joe, he came in here as one of the worst cases like Joe, he was in bad shape. You

Speaker 2:          00:23:45       remember what I was going through the sleep on your steering wheel and, and uh, that sleep apnea, like whenever my heart gets going and Jujitsu like no other places, my heart, they're gone like that when I'm on the bottom. And that's all. At first when I joined Jujitsu, I overcame the panic attacks. So I had to just go stand on the bottom, like I forced myself to get on the bottom. I kept like a, whatever you call it, a bridge or whatever they call it a frame and I breathe and I overcame my fear. But the other fear I had was when I get to round up, I can't control my breathing. It's when I get up from their sleep apnea. So I just, I kept thinking about something you said about a couple of podcasts ago, but a sports, uh, sports, uh, psychiatry is something. Sports psychologist, some people have it and I did some reading and I said, let me just go alleviate this last fit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:39       I mean, how many feet you, I got the needle for you. But last week I got, you know, I still get that thing in my ear. She stuck a needle in my ear. Acupuncture, they take the fluid out because my ear is not letting my right, my left ear, the Florida. So either they've got to put fluids in there just from we're taking showers, you know me, I'm obsessed with showers and I got plenty of plugs in my ears when I go in the shower and I go in there for an hour when you know, when California had the drought, I go to Vegas, I got one of those king size pin shouts. I smoked a joint going there for an hour and a half. I read jokes. Oh yeah. I love taking long showers, shower material. Really your best material level, you can even practice it in that fluid stuck in my ear.

Speaker 2:          00:25:23       And last week I went to acupuncture and she stuck a needle in there and when she took it out, it relieved the pressure. Joe, I could feel the blood dripping down my face and I could hear it hitting the pillow and I didn't pass out. Oh, I want to get these fears a little way back to tactical fitness. The rings, he has rings and Alberto taught me emotion that it's all about my breathing. I don't leave my ass on the floor. So I basically pick up my hips as a hip escape and in the same. Then I hold that breath, but I pulled myself up. I stay there and then I as I leave my hips back is when I exhale and then my arms go down on that one. So it's a two point breathing thing, dog. I do three sets of 10 of those. I'm on fire after that. Yeah. I'm a big believer in that. Fire

Speaker 3:          00:26:15       breathing is gigantic. It's another thing that seems so simple, right? It's another thing you tell people, oh, you got to do some breathing exercises. People that I'm not doing that shit. I'm doing bench and bro going to build up my pecs, bro. Right? That's what people do. They don't. They don't think that breathing is difficult, but breathing exercises I. This is what I tell people. Breathe in for one minute and breathe out for one minute. Tell me that's not hard. Just take a one minute breath in, look at a clock and say ready, go. And then breathe in for one solid

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       minute, nice and slow, and then breathe out for one minute. Nice and slow. You'll be fucking dead. You're not going to be able to do it. Most people can hold their breath for a minute. If you tell them to breathe in for one solid minute, it's really hard to do, but then you go to like a yoga class and you take, you know, Yoga, deep breathing, Pranayama exercises. They're very difficult and one of the things that I. When I first started doing yoga, like about two years ago, I really started getting into it again. The, the, the breathing exercises after class when you like, when you're doing those breathing exercises. It was like my stomach felt soft. It felt like it was kind of weak. Like you would get tired doing those. I'm like, why is my. And I was like, I'm just tired from Yoga.

Speaker 5:          00:27:25       Like why is my stomach getting tired from breathing out? Like pushing air out. It's so simple. Like I do sit ups and leg lifts and all this different stuff. Like why is that difficult? Because it's a different kind of thing and you're breathing, you're pushing air out with your diaphragm and your abdominal muscles. But now I could do it pretty good and, but you get to like that Hicks and Gracie Point, I'm sure you've seen that pull in the muscles up in these weird ways and make them dance and it's so connected. Brain brain is connected to your breeding, the heart granted to your breathing and understanding what's important to regain access to proper breathing. Yeah. Even for people to think, okay, breeding for meditation. No into the olive. No pre written is good for everything. He's visualizing what she needed to do it. They know reset.

Speaker 5:          00:28:13       You can switch from your pressing. But that the theory of the sympathetic and parasympathetic. Yeah, never sees him. You know, it's like you breathe correctly, especially on the stress and the you need to regain access to your community president. Especially if you need to do something that is more complex and you think about it. Some people that just thinking, okay, under, under the gas response, you know when my, my father Fraser fight or flight and the tuition is on. Okay. I probably go to my gross motor skills. Yeah. But some people like an advanced fight that on a an operator, they need to go to access to gross motor skills and fine motor skills. Think about, I'm going to run across this room. I need to use my gross motor, skipped over on foster, but I need to understand what am I going to find covert and maybe shooting back to a target.

Speaker 5:          00:29:00       So now you have final the skates on and gross motor skills. Any to be able to get my product vertical view because I can't explain my tuna. So hold on. Let's let your English was tripping. That's okay. I see. What you're talking about is a big motor skills like running and sprinting and then being able to shoot a gun up and be very precise and very accurate, which is an the outfit interpret that enables the people shooting at me from so complex. Complex. So do you have guys do that? Do you have guys like lift weights and then go or do licks, strenuous physical exercises then go immediately to a range or honoring? We do that, but also, you know, when we will start with what is the importance

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       of, um, learning how to recover fast to using the breathing recovery Britain, like the tactical breathing in some feel like you were talking about some they never see, they used to do a lot for me and it's a 44 seconds in, four seconds, four seconds on a very basic way to learn how to get back from the intensities to above your Ra Max tool, let's say 85 percent something that you can bring you back to a cognitive presence so you can make the right decision. So that's what you tell people to do. Take a four second end and for second out. So you're like slow controlling of the breathing. That's the beginning of understanding because we're going to be, when it would be going to start going into my nose and maybe taking a post, go out to my mind. So the, my iris would be in through the nose, out through the mouth.

Speaker 4:          00:30:30       Yeah. That does seem to somehow or another slow down your heart rate for some reason. Exactly. And that's your slow down. He's going to give you a senior back to your brain. Okay. Now we switched our finances under control so you can make the right decision. You can get back to the the final discussion that if it's needed right then that obviously with when you're training soldiers, it's got to be one of the most important things to do to be able to operate under pressure and under physical pressure and make the right choice. Yes, that's different. You know, they're not panicking. The survival response would tell you do the things that maybe it's more logical to save your life, but sometimes like I always use this example, we're going to cross the street right now. You're going to cross, you see the car, you're going to freeze, and then you're deciding, jump back or jump forward, whatever is your response to see.

Speaker 4:          00:31:16       Don't get hit by the car. Right? But it may take like 12 milliseconds in. If you've been training more to that kind of alarm, you're going to see the car and you want to do before you jump in and out. You're going to look and see on the other side because maybe you see the car, you jump back, you didn't see the car coming from another part and you get killed for the Ellicott that take our response of 300 millisecond, so it's the Amiga will tell you to do whatever is needed to get out from the problem faster, but the long way of your brain response, if you've been training, you become resilient to the alarm and shock situation. You're going to make the right choice and for an operator, for a fight or whatever, it's a logical thing about Jujitsu, a chess game, chess game, even those guys to play chess.

Speaker 4:          00:32:06       So under stress, our brain is cooking and the guys make a move and maybe me, but they're not playing and just, you know, I see the move. I see I got moved this way. The other guy's planning with taking more time to plan whatever is going on because you start to understand why you did that move. So it's not a logical for me, I shouldn't be going that way. And in training regarding access to your breath, into your right, to your brain, control is fundamental. That's why I believe we need to be careful and understand fitness is so important. We can do a lot of things. It's not just changing our other way. They look.

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       We can add different people in different things. For some people it's life changing. You had the ability to be calm under pressure is something that very few people have and they just don't. They don't. It's not something that they exercise. They don't get to do it on a regular basis. They don't get severely stressed so that when they are in a severe stress situation and they have to make a critical decision or they have to use fine motor skills in a critical situation, most people are just completely incapable of handling that. That'll emotional and physiological load or what is it about. There's something interesting about breathing in through your mouth that creates like a panic feeling. Like when guys are tired. Yeah. Like what is. I don't understand. Like it's a shallow breathing thing that happens. Yeah. They took too much air in. I believe that's what it is in the brace, the province, they bring clamp up called the, we call it like a, like a fourth leg to into the fear reaction and so for your brain, while you bracing, bracing where you don't know, something you never expecting.

Speaker 3:          00:33:40       So for my brain, my data bases say he's been there before in your life, you'd be freezing for something and they will bring you back. Okay, this is a fierce situation, so your sympathetic system is on and you start to lose control. Hit that panic mode. I think it's so simple. You know how many time you let you touch your when when you're under stress or under the assumption you know you'll be losing control of your. Maybe you. We fight. We have a discussion, very intensive discussion and you can touch your lace. So breathing in. One of the things that you really learned that during yoga class in various particularly stressful situations, it's so hard to breathe smooth. It's one of the. One of the things that I've learned how to do is to try to concentrate only on my breath and it actually makes the exercise easier, which doesn't seem to make any sense because before I would just be concentrating on the exercise and what I realized somewhere along the line is my breath is not very smooth and I'm not doing a good job of controlling myself.

Speaker 3:          00:34:42       So now when I'm in a situation like a really difficult like standing bow pose or something like that, what I concentrated on more than anything more even than the posture is just my breathing concentrate on big, slow, deep breaths and I swear it makes it like 10 percent easier. Just concentrating on the breathing makes everything easier. And Chrome Gracie said that too. When he was in here. We were talking about Jujitsu and he's like, it's breath. Breath is everything. And once you can control your breath, when you understand how to control your breath, it makes those positions better, makes Jujitsu easier. It makes everything better. So your breath control your breath, Jolie, and you say that, I think you know what? I allowed all of us. We know how to brace. Are we talking for half an hour? We never stop it and do it while we're talking, but we're not under stress to do the problem is what people. They don't know how to excel. If you take amend and put it under the

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       water with the head, right, what is the last things is going to do before you die? When it gets to breathing, so the body. Exactly know when it's time to inhale. It doesn't know how to. When it's time to exhale. That's fear. That's where we didn't have to force people. Hyperventilate. Like my six year old gets upset about things. Sometimes she hyperventilates like she just can't get it out. Like she's upset. Like someone did this to me, you know, and you've got to go, okay, you got to calm down. I want you to take some big deep breaths, but it's hard to teach a six year old doesn't know what the fuck do we do on stage for breathing? Just talk about. I never thought about it like I started getting anxiety at the store. So now when I walk up to the original room, like on Tuesdays or when I did the wheelchair and I forced myself to breathe in and out of my nose, but for years we're excited at the store.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       Yeah. And the original launch I've been back. I don't know. It all started. I had a follow Morgan Murphy. I don't know. I went up there, she was on stage and I don't know what it is. I just get anxiety and the original room just a little bit, just a little bit. And at the wiltern theater I walked out and I looked that way and then I looked at the audience and it was like woo. And I had to breathe through my nose, but what did we do on stage? Are we breathing through our nose or are we breathing through our mouth? We fucking talk shit for 45, one hour. I looked at the special shot. I'm like, where am I breathing?

Speaker 2:          00:37:11       Yeah. How interesting that we got to watch that next time. What the fuck are we doing up there? Yeah. You're not thinking. You're just breathing. Yeah. Will you just concentrated so much on what you're trying to say that it all just comes natural. Just like right now while I'm talking to you right now. I like. I took a little breath right there, but I wasn't thinking about it. I just don't want any. I want to get a little bit of air. Right, right, right. Because it's so natural for you. Maybe take me on a conference the first time and wasn't going to be shaking and go around into my ward and then you see that from people that are given speeches and you do see that when they've not become comfortable with public speaking. Public speaking is one of the most stressful things for people. For some people like number two or number one in some people's world, like it's really bad. I had one. One time a judge asked me, he was about to sentence me and he goes, do you ever say these for yourself? And I had it written down. I had everything. Joe Rogan. I started tweaking. He was like, don't worry about it.

Speaker 2:          00:38:16       Pan. I couldn't talk. I went right into a panic when this little man looked at me, but people get nervous, you know, and when you get nervous your adrenaline kicks in and when your adrenaline kicks in, everything tightens it, you know, just you know, and physiological stress like yoga positions can kind of mimic that. Like when you were in a position like when you got your hands over

Speaker 3:          00:38:35       your head and you're leaning your whole body to the side, it's very hard to stay smooth with your breathing when you're in those spots. Like that's the number one thing that I concentrate on holding my body in that position is not nearly as hard as holding my body and breathing smoothly. Breathing smoothly is the most difficult part of that posture, like a lot of pasta,

Speaker 4:          00:38:55       and as soon as it's changed your breathing, you started to changing inside and then you change it outside. I see. I see that happening. A lot of you know I love was the first reaction when you're under stress, tension, tension, but for four, if you look back there or what happened when you were in the pre storia phrase, three prehistory, greatest thing about it, that you are a prey. What you're doing. Yeah, like any animal, like a cat in the road and the road they start to pump. This is hair hot, become bigger. Right? So that's what we doing. We growing our shapes so the product might look at as like, oh, we're too big. I'm going to attack a simple, simple prayer. We try to, you know, our, our skin start to trickle in Sanford, like nice pumps. We, yeah, we don't have hair, but we start to do the same. Maybe the same example. Goosebumps are. It's like your hair's figure.

Speaker 4:          00:39:49       That's interesting and if I look in how come it's like that when you hear a good song that's a different feeling. It's like a lot of people, they misinterpret it or the old thinking that we thought, okay, we go tactical training, we do this and we can control a fear reaction to different things. You can control when you are really under stress for the kind of situation, so our rate for years and other things, matter of fact, I I intensity workout. You become erad under fear. You become important, so it's different. Different physiological things going into your into your body, so they all things that people didn't want. Any misunderstanding that doing some kind of a high intensity workout we can control also the fear, real fear because real fears and other things.

Speaker 3:          00:40:36       Well, one of the things you see with fighters is they perform better when they're more active, when they fight more often. So if the fighter fights like three times a year, they're used to fighting every few months and they get that feeling of competition becomes a normal natural thing for them. And it's also something that happens when you see a fight or lose. When you see a fighter losing and they come back, they were very tense and they fight. A lot of times they fight different because they're. They're now worried and concerned about the consequences of failure and you see that that fear, that tension, it's in their system and then they their whole, their whole mode of operating as a. As a, as an athlete changes because of that tension. There's the dinner to Cobra for the shot, for this situation they'd been through. Sure, and that's all.

Speaker 3:          00:41:19       Also one of the biggest factors when you talk about the difference between the way someone performs in the gym versus the way someone performs in competition. We've all known these guys that were phenomenal in the gym, but for whatever reason they weren't able to win in competition. It's so common. It's with some guys. It's almost like like it's crazy. It's almost like there's a spell on them or something like you'll see them in the Jimmy, like this guy is a world beater, but they can't beat anybody in a. In a competition. It is psychological. It's all psychological. There they are imprisoned by their own fears and doubts. They don't have the confidence to rise to the occasion. They don't have the confidence to perform under pressure. They don't have the. They can't just accept the potential failure. They can't. They're so overwhelmed and imprisoned by their fear of failure that when they get out there, they can't perform at their best.

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       It's crazy because it forces failure. It's like a self fulfilling prophecy because they can't perform like they do in the gym. They can't just react. They can't flow. Like when you were fighting, when you're at your best, you're sort of just in this empty space like you're not. You're not thinking about the moves as much as they're just happening and you're just relying on your training and you're almost the best thing you do is stay calm because as soon as you get emotional, as soon as you get aggressive, you might win being emotional aggressive. You could catch someone and knock them out, but you also might get knocked out yourself. You might do something that's not smart like when you're talking earlier about playing chess. Martial arts is a lot of ways, like very much like chess, but way more complicated because your physical consequences are so severe, so there's all this fear. It's not just about losing. It's about getting hit and that punishment of physical consequences is so significant. It's so much different even than in Jujitsu. Jujitsu, the physical consequences are tapping and losing and those are terrible, but it's nothing like getting kicked in the face or getting one of those Yoel Romero flying knees to your head. You know, that kind of fear is, that's an overwhelming fear and for some people they get a throw up when they're in the locker room and they did panic me, they get so scared they just can't perform under pressure.

Speaker 5:          00:43:30       You know, you know, if you could trust for this. Also through some of the operator, you know, the, some of the operator that literally dump and when you say an operator, you're talking about special ops guys that the tough and didn't a super guys know. I'm amazed by those guys. They just chapeau but there's naturally, oh, they don't do it in the task. It might. I might be shitting in my pants, you know, it's not physiological, physiological and then you keep going, just keep going with shit. And that's the physiological reaction to the stress factor. Your body wants to get lighter, to fight back faster or run away or whatever. You can control, you know, there's nothing to be ashamed about it. You see it with animals as well. I mean, there's a famous video these two bears fighting and as the bears are fighting, they're, they're shitting all over the place as they're fighting, they're shitting. I, uh, I, I love watching movies like collateral or something. When people go into some place and they shoot the place up and people's reaction are they run.

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       That's not usually the case, bro. I've seen it. People dropped on the fucking floor. People dropped without even getting shot. They don't know what. You just freeze the sound of you being somewhere and being transferred to the sounds of gunfire. It's fucking overwhelming. And some people get it and react to it. And some people just think it's the fourth of July. Yeah. You know, it's really weird. But I've seen people fucking dropped from fear dropped from fear, something that I was as a child when I was two blocks away from just people dropping from fear, you know, it's so like I remember when I lived in Aspen, they have the Esi body guard academy and aspect. What does that stand for? I don't know. But the guy supposedly was in a room six by 12 room where they killed 12 Mexicans at knife point with his bands.

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       So he opens up this Esi thing and it's, you know, it's 20 g's, you know, it's, it's a summer long program and you learn how to adjust up or die out the tube and drive and evasive driving and shooting. Then they have a course on maritime, how to defend people out on the ocean and all that stuff. But uh, she asked for it and all that, those places like woody creek where you went to his home, to the baddest retired soldiers in the world and you don't know who they are. You just think that dude over there with the American flag is mowing the lawn that I killed. 80 people want to end them. Bad Guy. There's a guy endeavor that I know, I'm telling you, Colorado is where they put them. Why, why they put them in because the mountains to keep them away from civilization for these people just in case they get Chinese music somewhere.

Speaker 2:          00:46:14       They don't ever want that to happen. Break glass in case of war. And there was a guy that came in that was a marine that bro Joe, you know, anybody comes in with stories. I know one thing when I see it, I believe it. The motherfucker used to get picked up at Aspen and put him in the helicopter though. Like they sent like a helicopter with two guys jumping out for guys around them and he was just waiting. But uncle Joey, I was 19 and he would tell me stories about, you know, the green berets and all these guys were sitting around a thing cooking chili and they will all tell telling how many people they killed killed 18. I killed 22. Meanwhile he was stirring the soup with this big over the fire. You know what I'm saying? Like that's, that's the type of stories this guy would tell me.

Speaker 2:          00:47:00       He had me all fucked up in the head and I asked him once I go, should I go to that Esi? And he goes, listen, I go in there and smack them all with my left hand. If he goes, first of all, you can't teach what you need to learn over there because four years of Charlie and the Bush is a lot better than 12 weeks of you hanging out with some white dudes with suits, shooting people targets and it's not real. It's not until there's real consequences. So that's why he said it just wasn't. Don't you think

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       though it's better than nothing? I would think that it's better than nothing. I would think that the best thing would be actually being in bootcamp, actually going to bud's actually being in some sort of a situation. We realized this is life, this is real. Whereas if you're, if you're preparing like up in Colorado and you just go through that course, you might have some things in your mind, but that's one of the things like people say to me like, like, should I take a self defense class? Like when they show you how to kick somebody in the name, I go, listen to me. That shit is not going to like, there was, there was a guy on the fucking radio that was, he was always talking about, uh, um, it was on opiod anthony show back in the day and he was always talking about this difference between the street and a martial arts and martial arts tournaments.

Speaker 6:          00:48:14       There's no rules in the street. There's no rules. And I'm like, I fucking hate when people say that kind of Shit because listen to me, the stuff that works on trained killers is the real shit. And if you think that you're going to come in and you're going to throw some fucking karate, chop someone's balls and you're going to somehow or another be able to stop Anderson Silva from kicking you across the room. You're out of your fucking mind, you're out of your mind. You, first of all, you're not going to karate chop his balls. He's not going to let you get close enough to him, and if he does let you get close enough to him, he's going to strangle you and you're not gonna. Be able to do a goddamn thing about it. You're going to be a 100 percent helpless. So this, these ideas that there's a shortcut and the shortcut is like street defense. There's a certain pressure points around your neck. I could attack that and you will be helpless. No, no, no. You're not going to get my neck. You father, let me grab your finger. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:49:02       There was a guy at the store he used to pinch down on literally the, this is the biggest phony I've ever met in all my years of meeting phony martial arts guys. He used to pinch down on your thumbnail. He was like, there's a pressure point and your thumb, like motherfucker do lie on me with their knee on my neck. Like they'll put all their weight on your neck to try to get you to give up the arm bar. Like if you're in a situation where you're defending, it's an art bar and the guy's on top, you guys will put their fucking knee a tour and 30 pound man will put his knee on your neck while he's trying to and it'll put all his weight on it and you're not. You're not tapping from that. You think I'm going to tap from a thumbnail.

Speaker 6:          00:49:39       It's funny. I. So people try to get into the, especially for community and try to teach them pressure points. Do you realize this guy's wedding, waterproof jacket? The material, you're not going to even access to the body. It's crazy. There's so many stupid martial arts courses and it's so. It's so fucking dumb. It's so dumb. There's so many, these ridiculous ideas that you're going to be able to defend yourself with some tricks. But you know, you were saying the cod people, people that love these things, you know, like shit, I have six bucks. Yeah, I mean there's training day in six weeks or whatever. Late night infomercials that you only have 15 minutes, but 15 minutes is two minutes too much. Thirteen minutes. It's all you need. Thirteen minutes. All you need is 13 minutes and you're like, wow. That's what I've been waiting for. I want to be shredded.

Speaker 6:          00:50:33       Great. In the beach. Thirteen minutes. Fuck the fuck Outta here. You've had a civilization of just these big thick pills, which are just things that a quick fixes. You know, if you stay up past one, it's, it's all attacking men. Testosterone level. I don't know what it is about people after one. I'm fucking tired. We're all tired. Yeah. So with sleeping. Yeah, but those guys that are up late at night, they just look like half a half. Add resistance is down. Do you have more sex drive? I mean they just sell you some fucking bill of lading, whether it's the big dick pills or the six minute workout and then they keep beating each other like by one minute we have the sick, but we have the five minute workout and you know what man? Half of America buys into that. A lot of America buys into the sap pills.

Speaker 6:          00:51:20       That's the sad thing. And once again, if you want me to go back to what we discussed before, it's not about us. So you know, you're breathing out, comfortable. You on the situation. I always give because I believe I've been there. I don't know you guys, but sometime you want, you desire to date someone so badly and you get so excited when you get it and the first day that you go, you feel like you cannot even move, you know, panic. And if you remember that day, it doesn't work the way that you want to. You, you pray, they go to work, but after you pass the first shot. But the second, the third is become better. It's exercising and breathing control. These are the same, you know, once you get used to, everything's comfortable. It's just, that's a big thing with again, what we were talking about with fighting.

Speaker 6:          00:52:03       When I, when I, um, I had one time where I tore a muscle. I didn't compete for like six months. It was like the longest time I'd ever gone without competing because I tore the muscle that connects the groin to like, um, I think it's called a Satorius muscle. It's like at the top of the leg. It was real bad. I couldn't throw any kicks at all. I can only do my workouts in the pool was pretty bad. And so when I was recovering from that, when I got back in the, my first fight back, I was like, wow, it just feels so off. My timing feels off. Everything feels weird. But then I fought again less than a month later and I felt great like less than a month later. Everything was like, all right, I know this again, this is, this is my thing. I've been here before.

Speaker 6:          00:52:42       And then it felt normal again. It's like when you were, when you have a girlfriend, if you have a girlfriend for a long time, you don't get nervous about whether or not you're going to get it up. You don't panic. Like we hope she looked at me. She fucking likes you. She's naked, she's right there. She's been with you forever. You know, she likes you so it's not, it's not an issue, but if you know, if it is, like you said, a curl that you've been thinking about for the longest time and you're only going to grow and I hope those schools will whoop and then you finally get weather like this panic and the, the human penis is such a fucking odd thing in that regard. You know, that's what a bizarre thing. It's designed to make sure like, look dude, if you ain't come, you're not going to fuck. Okay. Because we don't want any weak ass nervous

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       bitches out there make it babies. So the system is built to make sure that you're an addict is not get hard if you fucking panicking. It's not like, it's not like a Rhino Horn were armed and ready at all times. No, it's not like a very specific physiological process has to be in place with the softest part of your body becomes hard, like a fucking rock like that. The process itself is crazy. When you look at your Dick, when you go into p and it's this soft little spongy thing, and then you grab your Dick when it's at full mast and it's like, how is it the same thing? Because it's this crazy physiological process that only works if you're ready to rock. Uh, you, you can't be faking it like you, you, your body knows if you're panicking, right? You, it, there's a book, there's a book, I don't know how you translate it in English, but this is a book of this plane.

Speaker 3:          00:54:17       So was so simple about those reactions with the body under stress. And he say, think about the Zebra on the savannah. You know, that's exactly. You know, when you have someone that's choosing you to hit you and when you are under stress, I stress your body stops. Stop producing hormones like testosterone. Why you don't the last thing you want to have sex and when some lions behind you. So that's exactly what he's doing is shutting down whatever is needed, shutting down everything under stress. You know, when you are freaking out, you can perform. We can portfolio. No, actually I'll, confidentially zebras are so bizarre because the you see the way their body looks like they're not camouflage at all like white with black stripes on and for the longest time they thought that the white with black stripes on would confuse and animals mind. Like there's a type of Cammo.

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       Have you ever heard of a sat cammo as a type of camouflage? It doesn't look like trees or anything. It's just a bunch of black and brown lines and those lines for animals because animals there, their eyes operate on edge detection. They operate on a lot of them, especially prey animals like deer and things along those lines. They're, they, they, they see movement. They don't necessarily see things the way you see things. They mostly just see movement and so for the longest time they thought, well maybe when you're looking like a lion is looking at a zebra, the lion is seeing the zebras body and there's all the lines confused so he can't see it. Then they realized, no, no, no. What it actually is is you can't pick out individually zebras. So like if an individual zebra like it looks different from the other zebras, that's the one that they get after, like if one's ears bleeding and as blood on his body and it looks different from all those other white and black lines.

Speaker 3:          00:56:07       That's the one they targeted, which is kind of fucked. And one of the ways they found out this, they tagged a zebra, they put like an ear tag on a zebra and they sent Jordan Peterson was talking about this recently in this video and uh, they put it back into the herd and the lines immediately killed at Zebra. That's the one they went right to because it had something different. Like did you see all this book? White and black lines? And then, oh, this motherfucker's got an ear tag, get them. And he just went right after that. So it's, it's really designed like, look, we know we're get, we're fucked, we're born fucked. But if we stay together, you know, maybe with like look when you see that. So when you see all those ears together, it's super confusing. While we will have this fucking TV fixed soon, I swear I'm this, this, this TV cuts in and out that one pack.

Speaker 3:          00:56:54       So when you see these zebras and we see these lines, what it's designed to do is confuse the lions so that they don't know which one to target, which is crazy, but if one of those motherfuckers had an ear tag, a big old yellow tag hanging off their ear, the lines would be like, there you are a bitch. I see you. That's kind of cool. It's fun though. I mean, what a, what a terrible situation. Nature has given these poor things. The lions are camouflaged. The lions look like that. The brown grasses, you know, and leopard or excuse me, a tiger's apparently that whole stripe thing with them is also to make them blend in with all their surroundings, all the trees and the sticks. You know, they live mostly in the jungle. So you were asking me before this about the fights this weekend. What do you think would be good context that occurred?

Speaker 3:          00:57:46       That's why they keep. Well, they'd know except that it's. This is what I think a lot of people were like pissed off. It was boring, but I think that's because they just want to see people beat the fuck out of each other, which I understand. That's why you tune into cage fighting. But to me, the way I always described martial arts is it's high level problem solving with dire physical consequences. And if you run in on Tyron Woodley, you got some dire physical consequences. He's a fucking powerhouse. And if Woodley charges at Thompson, this dire physical consequences because he was getting tagged when he would he need said it to me after the fight. He's like, he caught me a few times as I was charging towards him. So Woodley has a different style and Thompson Thompson has that wide stance, that karate style and he's excellent at moving in and moving out and almost like point fighting you.

Speaker 3:          00:58:37       He just jabbing you, hitting you with these, uh, clean, lefthand sliding out of the way. Occasionally throwing kicks. But mostly what he's doing is making you wonder what he's going to do. And when he's coming at you and woody had to pick his battles and figure out when he could launch himself, Adam. So at any moment something could have happened, but a lot of shit didn't happen. So the people watching at home like that was the most boring fight over. It's because those moments are so critical. Those moments are so dangerous. You can't just. They would like it to be like Frankie Edgar Gray Maynard, just fucking chaos or punches thrown wild. Not going to happen like that. You can't do that with wonderboy. You can't charge at him like that. He will fucking counter you and you look, you will be one of those people on his highlight reel.

Speaker 3:          00:59:23       So tyron Woodley was very smart and that he knew that he couldn't charge Adam and wonderboy. He's not going to charge a willy either. I mean he got almost knocked the fuck out. And the first fight he almost got knocked the fuck out. And in the fifth round of the second fight to Woodley's a powerhouse man, he hits so God damn hard. So everybody had to be on their toes. They both had to be minding their p's and q's and that translated for a boring fight to a lot of people, but not to me. To me, I was like, anything could happen at any moment in the fifth round or almost did when, when, when Woodley connected and Thompson's knees went out, I mean he slumped. He was out, man. He was out for at least a half, a second or a moment, you know, there was a moment where his legs gave out.

Speaker 3:          01:00:05       His body went limp and they could've stopped the fight right there. I'm glad they didn't. Glad they kept going. I talked to a big John McCarthy in the cage after the fight ago. How close we are to stop with that fight. He goes, he goes, I wasn't close to stopping that fight. I go, what? You were looking, right? He goes, I was looking go. You were looking to close. He goes, I'll never admitted it goes, but it was. I mean, he was almost out right. He goes, he was almost out. It might have been out for half a second, but he, I gave him a chance. I go, you did a great job. He did an amazing job. I mean that's why big John Mccarthy so important. That guy with that kind of experience and if he fucked that up everybody would be so mad at him.

Speaker 3:          01:00:39       But he did it perfect. It was perfect. He has the most difficult job in the sport other than the fighters. Fighters have the most difficult job. Second most difficult job is the referee. Third most difficult job is the judges really? So I think so. Yeah. I believe is going to interpret that trauma for the other people. Well he has to be. He has to look. He has to be at the right angle. Like they're moving around and they're fast and they could go to his left and he can be over here, but something could be happening. I'm there. Right. And he doesn't even see it. You know, you don't know, like sometimes sometimes guys don't see taps. Sometimes guys don't see a certain I pokes or groin shots. There's a lot of things that can happen. A referee's job is insanely difficult and they only get praised when they fuck up.

Speaker 3:          01:01:24       They only rather get attention when they fuck up. They don't get any praise when they do a great job and just just they need more. They need more. More people need to understand like how difficult that is, so that moment where tyron finally did connect on wonderboy and everybody's like, why didn't you do that earlier? Because you could have got knocked the fuck out. Like that was where the opening was. Woodley was so aggressive because he was down on the score cards at least in his corner of his eyes and in my eyes. He was as well and he had a charge forward and he had to connect and he did, but to make that happen, a lot of things have to be in place. You have to understand wonder boys timing. He had been fighting him for four rounds already. He was getting a sense of what wonder boy could and couldn't do.

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       He also knew the consequences. He'd been tagged a couple of times so he knew like I can't just rush at them because wonderboy was trying to tie them with that right hook. He was standing on the South Pole position with his right leg forward. He throws that front side kick to the body, throws it really well because he, he picks it up from the ground like low and and sort of scoops up so you don't see it coming until it's too late. It might not be the most powerful application of the front leg side kick, but it's very. It's very sneaky because he slides in with that foot low and then it comes up and stabs you and you don't know if it's going to come up as a sidekick or if it's going to go up and over your shoulders around kick. You don't know what he's doing.

Speaker 3:          01:02:45       He's so sneaky. So tyron had to be very cautious and for a lot of people it was very boring because of that, but I didn't think it was boring was happening. I was on the edge of my seat. I was just like, there are moments. There's going to be moments when the shit starts flying and in those moments, that's where the fight becomes amazing, but those guys are smart. They're not dumb in the belt is so God damn important. When you have the belt, you get to decide, you fight all the best fighters, you, you, you, you make the money, you know, you get the opportunities for the big money fights, like the conor mcgregor type fights. Those only happen if you have the belt. If you don't have the belt, nobody gives a fuck about you. So for a guy like Tyron, man, that belt is everything.

Speaker 3:          01:03:25       For a guy like woody or a guy like a wonderboy, rather, that belt is everything. If you don't have that belt, you make a fraction of what you make. Like think about that, fight that fight. It's insanely close. It was so close. Dominick Cruz afterwards. That's basically the same fight as the first fight, right? It's like you could call if you've called the first fight of draw, you could easily call this fight a draw and I agree with him in. So that means that wonderboy and Woodley are essentially like so closely matched stylistically that it's a wash. Right? But meanwhile, Woodley's the one who's the champion, will, he's the one who has the potential to fight. Conor McGregor Woodley is the one who has a potential to fight Michael Bisping or whoever who else he fights at whatever he fights at and that is where the money is. So he's the guy who's going to get the money.

Speaker 3:          01:04:07       Whereas wonderboy who essentially had a draw with him prove that he was at least close enough on one fight and just a hair under the second fight, he ma, he's gonna, make a fraction of what woodley mix likely so that those consequences have to be taken into consideration when you're watching these guys fight, is that they know there's a wind bonus and there's a loss. Like if you, if you lose, you get your show money, you don't get a bonus, but if you win, you get twice the money. Like a lot of guys have that way, their contract is structured, you know, they'll make x if they win and they'll make x plus x if they'll make x plus x if they win. But if they lose, they only make x. So they might have, they might be getting $200,000 for the flight, but another $200,000 if they win, that's a giant swing. That's a big deal. So they have to be really fucking careful. They don't make mistakes. I don't like when bonuses, man, I don't like it. I think those guys are trying to win anyway. They're trying to win. I just, I just think like especially in particular in situations like that, when fights are like that fucking clothes, like a judge can decide whether or not you make an extra 200 grand or don't like. That seems crazy to me to do training

Speaker 6:          01:05:19       boxing a few a few weeks ago. Right. Back doing Jujitsu again too. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah, that's cool. I was, but I wasn't walking back last night at the crane academy. I was night. I came back from Ventura, was teaching a workshop and I need some let go something. I didn't want to lift weights. The dojo empty. Why every bags, gloves, et cetera. Let's go. Yeah, that's cool as well. Heavy bag I think is everybody would do better if they had a heavy bag in the garage. Just go out there and hit that thing. It feels good. You don't even have to have great form. Just go out there and hit it. It's so good for your body to just explode and just release tension and stress. And for people of like joint issues, they have these water bags. It's essentially a thick layer of um, the outside is like a thick layer of padding, like a few inches of pad of foam.

Speaker 6:          01:06:10       And then inside of that as a water bladder, it's filled with water. So when you punch like your boss, your arm goes into it, but you could really dig in and hit it hard, but it doesn't have the same impact on your joints. You don't feel it so much in your elbows and your shoulders and stuff because it was given to a creativity once in Sicily, you know, ever been easily. That was the first time last year I went to Italy. Cool. Loved it. They're like, oh man. I went to Rome, went to the Vatican, saw the Vatican. We went to, um, what is the mountain area? Donate Dolomite? No, goddammit. Alpine. We, it was out near where the, um, where the volcano killed everybody. Vesuvius. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we went there and then we went to uh, the Mafia. Amalfi coast. Yeah. Beautiful. Oh Man.

Speaker 6:          01:07:01       Amazing. So beautiful. Didn't even seem real. It seems like you were in front of a green screen. You look out, you know you have to go on this mountain roads. Crazy. Joey. It's a road that should be one lane. Should we one lane, but it's too. And there's pluses on it. Fucking buses and motorcycles. Assholes and motorcycle weaving in and out of cars. People in Italy. Dr. Like fucking maniacs like you had never seen. We all know Italians are kinda crazy. I'm mostly Italian. And you're going to have the left hand steering wheel. It's regular. Like regular. Yeah. It's only lefthand in England and Japan. South Africa. Yeah. You got into the car with a left right here. Will Australia as well? Australia. It's fucking confusing as shit. You're like, where am I going on the wrong side. If you have a. If you didn't, never, never to driving.

Speaker 6:          01:07:52       Oh yeah. Because you have the shift with your left hand is. Oh yeah, but you, you still love the clutch is still on the lefthand side, right? And the pedal steel in the right to adjust. But it would be the opposite version. Yeah. So this is the what it's like on the mouth of coast. So you're driving on this road. This is what it's like. That's a two lane road jelly. There's a fucking bus coming and you've got to figure out how to get a car pass that bus. And we were going like, and I'm not exaggerating, half of a mile an hour

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       trying to get past cars and buses. Absolutely. It takes forever to get up there. It should take 10 minutes. That's the road. It should take 10 minutes. It takes 90, but once you get up to the top, look at that picture. Where you seeing the ocean? Jamie? Like up in the right hand corner. Upper right? Yeah. Like they're, that's what it looks like when you. Once you finally get updated, like wow, it's so pretty. So pretty man. Italy's amazing. The foods and the foods grow out of this world. Fuck your gluten. You Bet. All your gluten free bullshit. We've got to let that go. When you're in. A lot of people here say, Nah, you go at least nothing like that. That's Americanized one. It's more fish and stuff. There's a lot of. Well, they definitely did a lot of fish. Do they use, do they still use gravy?

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       Like red sauce? Not so much. Not so much. You could get it though and I think one of the reasons why you can get it is because probably people have come over there and wanted it, you know? Do you remember that episode was a prime. That was with the guy who it. He's like, I want gravy and the one way to look at the other one, he goes, he's east coast. The talent's there was classes with the Germans because he wanted spaghetti with gravy. Big Old. Would you say gravy? Like people are like, what is he talking great. Like people think of like gray. No kids. Yeah, it was spaghetti sauce. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can get Bolognese over there, but what it, it's just the Americans that came over, they developed a different sort of style of eating. Like a lot of meatballs.

Speaker 2:          01:09:48       I got afraid though. You don't like it when you come here as an immigrant. Like when I came from Cuba, like when you're a white kid. That's my, my, my daughter Likes Alfredo. That shit's going to get cut off the menu and like a month. But you know, my fucking world. That's what people in Iowa. That's the first Italian they eat. Like how afraid you. No, no, no, no. That's like a one month training thing. Like, like I even had it out a little fucking job. Like that's how Alfredo was. Yeah. When I was. When I came from Cuba and I've tasted Italian for my mind blew up, you know? Um, I was into all angles of it, but the red sauce was last. I'm afraid though with fucking those thick noodle sauce I'd like to give to a fucking horse. But what it looked like, chicken and Broccoli.

Speaker 2:          01:10:40       Mushrooms. Come on. Jamie's a good, good. You grow out of, out of that. It's not my first choice, but I liked it. I didn't ever heard about that since when I moved here in 91, 92, 93. Everybody was asking me, do you like 15 afraid of saying I don't even know. That's hilarious. No Italian. I said not for me that it's like going somewhere in another country. I can tell you just the cheeseburgers on American one of the meals. So you have bullet Asia, but Robbie Yada have pacifiers rule you about that, you know that the location that they call it. No real name. Like Pasta Fagioli yeah. They don't call it pasta pasta for little. But then what's in the like we can't get that stuff. He encountered Doug. What's that guy? But go with one the green stuff to stop and catch your Dick hard.

Speaker 2:          01:11:40       I thought it was a blue. What are you putting beans and um, that the green stuff. It's not pesto. That's the best. No, it's not spinach. What they call. It's two things. So you're talking about a type of vegetable x. got old and being a girl gets you deckard. Huh? I think you did was just getting harder to make that shit. November, you know, I ain't possible. When I first tasted it, I hated it every day for like 40 days. Like when I first went to my house, I went from one 60 to one 94, just eating pasta for me that's the only thing. They were lifting weights and possible. You get jokes Jack. It's like taking the ball, just pop those beans that's got old and that in the winter with all that garlic and stuff, you're off and running. I didn't have a lot of fish.

Speaker 2:          01:12:42       Like you had amazing drive by the Amalfi coast. They had amazing seafood, but the pasta was like a very light sauce. Like a, you know, you get like if you go to a good place and got like Linguini Vongole, they'll give you a link with a very light olive oil and garlic sauce with the linguine and like that is the kind of like. It's a very much more a delicate pasta. Yeah. Because you're going to taste the fish flavor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's why if you try to go to a real Italian restaurant, you ask for cheese, grated cheese on like Linguini vongole. They'll look at you like you're a fucking monster. Who are you? You're not going to put the cheese on the top of the fish. Yeah. They'll say it's not recommend or not recommend. They look at you like, don't do it, and you're like, Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah, come on, come on.

Speaker 2:          01:13:29       Hit me with it. Like Kevin James and I used to always get Linguini and clams and he would get pissed if they didn't come home with a cheese. Like where's the guy with the cheese? I've got to have the grated cheese. And you would try to put it on like at a good restaurant. They would get. They get upset with you. I don't want you putting that cheese on it. If you have like, like a spaghetti Bolognese or something like that, they'll, they'll ask you next cheese then that makes sense. But they don't even come near you. They'll try to stay away from your side of the table. If you've got linguine with clams, they don't want. They don't want to give it to you and even red wine, red wine with fish to get mad. They get mad. They get mad. You're supposed to drink white wine was really.

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       Yeah, they get that upset with it. I don't drink white wine. Dry white wine. I drink barely, but red wine is better than y for me. I mean I'll drink white, but I don't order it. Like if somebody pours me glad I'm not going to. It's not awful, but if I have a choice, it's always red. I like red red. To me it's like it's got a flavor that's compelling. It's interesting. It's like, it's like it's a lie and it's white wine is like chick drink. Sorry girls. I drank a fucking. My mom used to have a bar and she had night and we'd go home when I was real young, like four or five in New York City and my mom would have a little classroom red wine, the wine with the fucking Italian paperwork on it that.

Speaker 5:          01:14:47       Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:14:51       Like that shit. So I was, I was maybe four, maybe five, and I would watch her one night I watched it go to bed and I said, fuck it. And I took that bottle of wine. I fucking drank the whole thing. She woke up like six hours later. They couldn't find me. Call the police. I was missing. You were drunk as fuck and the closet shit. Pew. I never drank wine again three years ago. Smell. It's still get sick. I got sick. I remember she telling me all the time, you will never like one because you got so hammered. That time. We called the cops. We did everything. They couldn't fucking find you a burger. What's your martial arts background?

Speaker 5:          01:15:33       I started with boxing. Regular boxing. Then I find that that time it was like 82 a big things easily was full contact. Karate, those big named Ben. Ben. Ben, Ben of the Gender Akita is out here, man. He's from me. I used to train his gym when I first came here. When it first came to California, Jedi blank. De Blank was done in. And the palisade. I believe this guy though. Yeah, she blinky Rodriguez, he was out here as well. He's Benny's brother-in-law that's stuck with that and then we tie came and fell in love. That's why my voice is my big thing for that more type. Fucking change everybody's eyes. As soon as you realize how hard it is to get kicked in the leg. Well. Oh wait, what? Yeah, that was, I was like, everybody, you know, it never try know. The first time I went in to say, okay, what is it going to be?

Speaker 5:          01:16:23       Nothing different, you know, it's like being around that was kicking the legs and they hate me. I remember I couldn't walk for a couple of days and man fall in love. So like more dyes that are competing with karate style, with the Shin a, whether we're the instep rather you kicking with the top of the foot. Everybody had this idea like that was the way to do it. And then the moment you get kicked with a Shin you go, oh, that's a. and they got a lot of injury for kicking on the East App. Oh yeah. On my ankle was. Yeah, he was devastated. So need to recondition your mind like we discussed in the beginning of a Shin kick change. Then during the past, you know, for, for the skewer to investigate different style, different and

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       defend. The guy that changed my, my way to see things transferred, not to competition or to, to to my line of duty was a guy in Israel, but it's because it's been into for war three. A man is like, become like a second father for me. And he always told me, you know, it's the spirit. I don't care the way that you punch, the way you kicking in until your mindset is not on point, he's not going to be the not going to be ready to do something for real. You know, it's so that they can tell you, do carotid, do Jujitsu, do they do that? But if your mindset, real things, when you go to war, you do you need to apply these fins for change.

Speaker 6:          01:17:48       I think he's right, but he's also not right because I think he's right in the sense that your mindset must be correct in order for you to apply any, any sort of martial arts in international competition. Absolutely, but it's always important to have the right technique.

Speaker 4:          01:18:02       Oh yeah. No, no, no. I don't miss. Maybe I miss same. Israel was working on already on. He never believed in. Is there an Israeli guy he say introduced the Jujitsu a lot, introduce to do the Bj Bjj and his system to do the bottle or the box and we tie, so you need to have the full aspect of that. And then of course if you go into the Australian special forces there, the secret service and you need to have the right guy to do that. Some people are not ready to be a warrior. Can train like a warrior now warrior.

Speaker 6:          01:18:32       Yeah. Yeah. I can only imagine. Especially like Krav Maga in the United States, there's legit Krav Maga schools in the United States for sure. There's really good instruction is really good, but there's also a lot of fucking horseshit. Just like with karate, like there's a lot of mall karate where you go to these places and they might be fine for little kids. They're learning little martial arts, learning, little discipline, they have goals, you know, I want to get my orange belt and they get it and they get excited and it's good for them. It's good for their mind, but it's, it's, it's really critical when you're learning a martial art, one of the most important thing is to find a legitimate instructor. It's the most important thing because relearning things is so hard. Back when I was teaching, when I taught someone, they didn't know. If they didn't know anything, they came to me with no martial arts experience.

Speaker 6:          01:19:20       It was so much easier than if someone came to me with bad martial arts experience because if you have a. like if he took karate for a few years from some Bozo and you did everything all wrong, I would have to reteach you so when you would panic, if you would get nervous, you would go right back to that old way. Like as soon as someone puts the pressure on you, you would go right back to the old shitty technique. That's exactly what it's still about. What is your learning and the movement that is in your brain is the same position or whatever you will achieve a you put into the other way is wrong. You're under stress. Is gonna repeat the same face. That's where the everything man, even for pool, like there's certain techniques that people learn where they don't learn how to do pool correctly.

Speaker 6:          01:20:02       You only playing billiards, you stand the wrong way and you get used to it and when you're in a match and there's a lot on the line, you go right back to the old ways. Even if you take lessons like it's so important that when you learn things in life to learn them right the first time. That's why when you're growing up as a human being, I think it's been an issue with me. I think it's been an issue with you as well. When you. Your childhood is kind of fucking crazy. Like you develop these ways of thinking and acting as a child that are very difficult to break as you get older and you get as an adult, it's like you have this foundation that's a very faulty and you have to be cognizantly aware. You have to be consciously aware of that. Okay, this foundation is fucked up because I grew up with domestic violence and I grew up with no dad and so I have to make sure that I don't fall into these patterns that I had established in my head when I was eight, nine and 10 and 11.

Speaker 6:          01:20:56       You know, as you're growing up as a, as an adult, this is the way you're looking at life and then you have to kind of restructure. It almost sounds like you're starting over, but if you meet someone who has like a great father and a great mother and they grow up and they have like a great fundamental balance by this. Those people used to always make me nervous when I was a kid because I was always like, God, like these. I don't even know anybody like that. I got on. I don't like, I would feel like inferior to them, like when I was around people that had a good childhood, I would feel inferior. I still do. You sure? I feel. I feel weird if I like I have, I have friends that I think about them now when I go, I want to really interview their parents like what did they do to get this kid to be such a fucking?

Speaker 6:          01:21:44       What was the recipe to get this child to be fucking superhuman being, and I'm not talking about Julia servings, father or fucking gsps debt. I'm talking about people who you meet in life that I really fair, that are really kind. I look at those people and I go, I wondered what their parents did with that. Mike. Good to have that ability to want to help people and go out of that way. You know, I always think about that shit. Especially now as a parent, you're like, what is the fucking chemistry of love for them to understand? You know, we were talking on the way up there when my mother died, you know, it was the seventies and let's face it, we were still specs and that New Jersey neighborhood, you know, in Boston and those areas, you hear things, but I remember those Italian kids coming to my mom's wake and they couldn't make eye contact with me. The same ones that would say spic or whatever because I short circuited that. I broke them because the number one word, admittedly his mama, right. That's it. That's it. When you're in town and everything, his Mama, they would come to that wake and I would short circuit them because they never could think of that situation that happened to them and I'm still friends with those people today

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       and I always wondered why, you know, who raised him that that super great people and then you come here to a place like California and you meet people and they have nice parents or whatever, potentially the biggest scumbags in the fucking world. Do you follow them? That's what interest me in my life. I always feel like those people, the parents probably weren't around that much or I might be really nice people, but they didn't, they weren't around to really install the right ideals and values and morals in their system. You know, maybe the parents were off at fucking swinger parties or some shit. I always look at that, you know, with uh, even the kids I grew up like I have a friend that his dad was little but his mother was solid. And when you say his dad was a little, you mean gang?

Speaker 2:          01:23:55       I'll put a bullet in your fucking eye ball. I'll put a bullet in your eyeball at lunch, you know, I mean, when I would hang out with them, people's parents would come to me and go, I wouldn't be going over there if I was. You really see the article on his dad? Yeah. Oh, he's a psycho. No, no, no. He was a crazy. We're just a street guy. Okay. And you know, today the kid is one of my best friends. Never had a problem, never had a law problem. Never. No record, never check it. Married children. Well, you know, there's people that grow up with horrible environments and they come out amazing and then their brothers and sisters are all in jail. It's weird how a person makes choices in their life that really establishes their entire life and a lot of that, those choices, man, I hate to say it, but it could be luck.

Speaker 2:          01:24:41       They could've made a lucky choice early on and that lucky choice led them down a better road than someone who's made, made a poor choice. Like kids that get involved in the juvenile detention system when they're really young boy that fucks them up. So was a horrible, horrible and a good friends can know good people are on juveniles and again continued the right things. You know, even even if it's hard when he's telling you the truth and the of sounds like a smack be on their ads, but make you open your eyes. Make you say, you know what? A kid, once you put a kid in one of those gladiator, a prisons, the percentages, just like we were just talking about that movie that came out of sleepers, all four of them went away. Two of them came out to become westies. The other two came out to be decent.

Speaker 2:          01:25:28       The percentages, it's 50 fucking percent. Yeah, and that's, that's on the, that's on the conservative side, right into the higher you. Once you get that first tattoo and smoke that first cigarette, all those things, your percentages go deeper and deeper. You know, once you get the tattoo knuckles that say fuck good, Mike Tyson got the face tattoo at 40. Everything had already all the bad stuff out of his life. He had already come through, but it might Tyson with a cane with that face tattoo at 18. You know, it's so weird. Like how I saw it, I saw people on the bottom

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       that today, that successful in the police records don't matter, nothing matters. Yeah. And then I saw other people who were like sneaky people who now they're in trouble for tax evasion. You know what I'm saying? Like there's always. Yeah, my mother was a big things for me. Like I said, Mama, my mind had been burned. My mother, she always told me to give it more that you can do, you want him to receive the Dapa. And then it was a bit told me, you know, like be, you know, straight to people, you know, don't, don't, don't fort around yourself so you're not going to force it on people. And I believe that things, you know. Yeah. It also helps if, you know people that work hard. When I was a kid, um, my, my best friends had jobs and they worked hard. They were constantly working.

Speaker 6:          01:26:50       There were always working at a young age. Yeah. My friend Jimmy and Jimmy Law, I'm still buddies with them to this day, but we were in high school. I was fucking guys always worked in high school and high school. I always worked, always worked at construction jobs, always worked. I had construction jobs too because my dad was an architect. My Stepdad, um, uh, always set me up with these construction crews and stuff. So I did these jobs that we're in. So it gave me the understanding that you like, like if you've never worked hard and you don't know what the fuck hard work is, then all of a sudden you're 18 and then you're in college and then you got out of college, then you have to get a job. You have no real experience with actual difficult work. I just don't think you appreciate what it takes to get by and growing up, seeing people that had a strong work ethic and realizing that that wasn't something that I had, but maybe it was something that I need to consider as being like a very important skill, a very important trait.

Speaker 6:          01:27:47       The ability to just actually get shit done to get up in the morning when your alarm clock goes off and go, you're uncomfortable, you want to stay in bed, it's cold out. You don't want to do it. That, that ability to just do it, just get up and do it. You know that old Nike slogan, just do it. It's one of the best fucking slogan of all time. You know what I mean? People actually went out and worked out just because that just do it. That might've been like the most effective ad campaign in the history of ad campaigns when it came to actually getting people to do things that are uncomfortable and something that actually made sense. Just do it so fucking so important. It's so important. Just gotTa fucking get things done and for so many people, like you were talking about the beginning of the podcast, show me that book, the war of art where it talks about resistance.

Speaker 6:          01:28:33       There's so many people that just fuck off. They fuck off and they don't get the things done that need to get done and that haunts them. We know it as comics. We know so many guys that told write new material. They just don't. They just don't. They don't work. They don't work. You know why? Because when you have new material man, sometimes it doesn't go well. Sometimes you bomb. Sometimes you go up and it's clunky. It's not ready and when you do a special like will you just released a special. You know what it's like, you didn't need that materials

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       dead now and so now you have to write all new material and you have a bunch of people that are coming to pay to see you. Oh my God. It's always good. Yeah. I panicked every fucking week. Every week when I go on the road I panicked because I don't have a full 50 minutes of. Nope. I got a couple fucking minutes and I'm trying out new shit constantly. Constantly. But can it comes together slowly but surely together, but it's just like anything else. It's sticking with it. Right now I'm in a slump. So what do you do as a baseball player? Jamie? When you're in a slump, what do you do as a baseball player? You quit. No, you keep fucking hitting and you keep striking out. You keep fucking striking out and you keep it together. You cannot lose it. I Eka Tony Perez, 1976 slash 75 against the Boston red sox.

Speaker 2:          01:29:50       He went, oh, for 17 in the series and then game seven, he hit the single that chains. They won the world series really? So he could have just said, I don't want to do it. I know I'm going to comedian slump. Well, not anymore now, but like in December and January it was fucking heavy jack. But you just got to work yourself through it. There's no other way to get yourself through it. It's. There's no other way. There's no other. There's no other way you don't want. And for me, I could lie to you and say, well, I'm not going to get on stage. I'm going to stay home and write for the next three months. That's not good enough. Wrong answer, Jack. That's not going to work. It's not going to know. You've got to keep going to the well, like right now I have a problem.

Speaker 2:          01:30:27       You know, last year I have such a fear of being on my back and Jujitsu that it really fucking made me. I will not quit. I will not quit because what happens if I'm on with Joe, I'm with my family one day and I got kicked in the stomach and I'm on my back. Am I going to panic so I cannot fucking quit. So I kept going back to digital, but the weird thing was I was doing it wrong even though I was putting in the time I wasn't working on my breathing. I thought that by me going three times a week and doing what a fighter does, stay in the and that fighting three times a year that my breathing would come together. It will come together. But then little not, not good, not good delivery. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like the time I put in for what I get back wasn't rewarding enough.

Speaker 2:          01:31:14       Like I would think of going to a different approach. So. And then I started doing those little things with Alberto when the back when I get there, the breathing. You know what man? I'm a big boy now. You don't have to tell me Dick. I know I got something wrong with the back of my head with that fear Shit and it with the needles and what did I do with the needles? Dope. I could faint, faint. Walking into a doctor's office. I could smell cotton. I can't smell shit. I could smell fucking cotton. Like walk into a doctor's office. I could smell that. Associates with fear. Tremendous. When I walk into a doctor's office, my blood pressure is 190 over one 60 dogs. They look at me and go, how were you walking? I go, take a hike, come back in 10 minutes. And once my doctor comes back and

Speaker 3:          01:31:59       he starts talking to me and we talk about Chicago beef sandwiches, he goes, watch this. And it's 1:40 over 80. I figured, right? I know, I know. I lived through this. I lived through it.

Speaker 4:          01:32:12       It's a four. It's all about for me, when a train people, you know, I tried to say, okay, you're doing tempo shop and if you come to the eight, the number eight and you'll see that you start to struggle. Does that stop? I don't allow you to do a bad number, a number nine because I know number nine is going to be a bad push up. So. But for them. So what happened? When you got to be under stress, you're going to be repeating the best for them. So for me it's the constantly I try to remap you, like you said before, when you were teaching, remapping the way that you always try to achieve the best. So like you said, just do it. What I say. Okay. You need to repeat the things and to you never do it wrong. Don't do it right. You'll never do wrong. Right? Once you can come from blackness is a like shot, I want you to learn how to do it right every single time and that's when we can step forward to the next level.

Speaker 3:          01:33:00       Do you subscribe to that? Pavel Salini, you know he's got that strong first. Allow the ideology where you don't do, you don't do the failure ever. And I do that now. So that's how I do all my work. I don't, I don't lift to failure ever. Like say if I could do 10 reps or something, I do five and then I wait like 10 minutes and not do another five. Then I'll wait 10 minutes, I'll do another five. They don't like 10 minutes. I'll do another five. And the idea being that it's more important to do more workouts in the week with low repetition than it is to do a high repetition workout. Like you know where the guy's like, come on, spot me last one. That's not good. Your body's not designed to do that. Your body's not designed to be at failure ever. So what you're supposed to do is build yourself up.

Speaker 3:          01:33:45       So you're doing these exercises and he says that you should think of them as a skill. That strength strengthens a skill. So each exercise you're doing, you don't want to be tired when you're doing a skill, you don't want to be completely exhausted when you're trying to pull back a bow and Arrow or shoot a pool game or shoot a ball and pool. What you want to do is you want to have that cemented in your mind when he calls greasing the groove, like each time you do it, you'd do it perfect. You do it with perfect form and you just do low repetitions with heavyweights.

Speaker 4:          01:34:13       Absolutely. You know Pablo and trump first. But if it's another amazing, it's cool. Yes. And one of my coach of strength conditioning. Yeah. And yeah, that's what I do for myself. He didn't even because of those flights, you know, my jet lag, my cns machine, none of the assistant medical already what I do when I train, I never, I'd maybe I'll every four week I tried to do one or two reps and 95 percent. I never tried to do a personal record. I always liked to work like 85 percent few reps show. Even psychologically I know that I can enter the good form at that level and never got out

Speaker 3:          01:34:49       for people who are interested in this. Go go to a pavle has a lot of stuff online, but I think some of the best stuff online is him on the Tim Ferriss podcast. Really

Speaker 6:          01:34:57       excellent stuff and you know, he's got his own books out there and he's got books on tape and he's got videos and you could see a lot of his videos, but his method is so good. It's so. It's so smart and it's made big differences with me. First of all, it's cut my injuries down radically, like radically because I would be doing these, you know, 12, 15 repetitions with heavyweight and like barely getting the 13th one and then the 14th and then you know, your forum gets all fucking sloppy. Your back's bending in a weird way. It's terrible for you. It would be terrible. We've been totally that. Just, you know. Yeah, no pain, no gain. That was shit. No, that's not how you, it's so dumb. But now I'm lucky that I have weights at home so I have kettle bells at home so I can do it four days a week, five days a week and I'll work out for an hour.

Speaker 6:          01:35:44       I'll just go in there. It's 8:00 in the morning. I start lifting, I'm done in an hour and I'm not even exhausted. Not only am I not exhausted, I feel kind of pumped up and kind of charged, but I'm not like, oh, like I used to work out sometimes, like back in the day I would do lifts and uh, by the time the lift was over, my fault, I was light headed, my legs were shaking, I could barely walk and you don't have any energy left to do things and I've try to go to Jujitsu. Hilarious. I would just get mauled, just couldn't do it, you know, it'd be fucking wrecked for like two or three days. So I'd be really nervous to lift in the morning and then do Jujitsu at night because I would know that I was going to be operating at like 50 percent or 60 percent.

Speaker 6:          01:36:23       I'll just get my ass kicked. But if you do kettle bells with low repetitions, even with heavy weight, you could do a real good workout. And then that night you could work Jujitsu and you can be 100 percent close to a bluff. Pavel, Pavel Tatsumi will tattoo you in touch with Leni Habib. He also wanted like, he doesn't, he wants you to finish the Kettlebell workout energized. He doesn't want you to finish it. He doesn't want that at all. I read that. That's this whole thing. God wants you to finish. They're ready to go take on the world. And I tell you I was, I called Joe or they go joe, you to go, you gave me the kettle bells. I love doing cleans. I love doing the gun slings, but you know, I try to do 10 sets of 10, 12 swings and 10 minutes and I would do that and I've achieved my goal and I'd be very happy.

Speaker 6:          01:37:18       But then I couldn't go to Jujitsu for three days. Yeah. So what the fuck did I do? I'm 53, you know, but I would go, I did it, that had five sets of cleans with two fives and then a jump rope and then try to do setups and then for three days of dog shit, dog shit. And I called him up and he goes, go cut it in half. And then I said, you know what? I'm only going to do my weights now. On the road when I go to a hotel now, every two weeks I work every other week I'll hit the dumbbells and do the elliptical, but when I'm in town I'll just do the tactile, the beginning, a little it Jujitsu and then

Speaker 5:          01:37:55       I'd do attack with at the end. And you know what man, I don't want to walk around hunched up when I'm 60. I got a four year old. I got to be around and be. I liked it. I could touch my toes, you know, I like all this stuff. But one thing I noticed about tax fit that there's a couple movies that they put in there. I don't know if you did it or somebody did that, that Jujitsu friendly. Oh yeah. Like the moving movement to know if you look at when you look, even the kids rolling around when is a, his early stage. You go through something like, you know, double as they can transfer machine box or whatever. You can go into the rolling into the garden. So we got to talk to them like, oh sorry. So sorry. So again you can see moving his moment. So what we would start to do it start to analyze those moments and try to get a mechanical information about those moments. Yeah. But the APP, they apply very well on transition for some Jujitsu and that's another things that are bad. There was no, it was blowing his mind. Say if I get the guys to move better, it's easier for me to pass the technique because they, they, of course, they already know it.

Speaker 3:          01:39:03       One of the things that Eddie founders, that guys who are break dancers, yes, excelled in Jujitsu. And uh, there's a kid who fought this past weekend, landover Nada in Orlando. Vanana groovy. Lando fought this past weekend. He fought David Tamer. Crazy fight was a co main event. Lando has only been striking for six years and, but he's phenomenal. But what happened was he started with a BMX background. He was a pro bmx racer and was like apparently like a national champion and bmx and that pumping, pumping bike legs, you know, just be being able to like, like generate extreme speed off the line. He developed as explosive ability to use his legs. And so that like having cross training, whether it's through tack fit or whether it's through yoga or whether it's two kettlebells or break dancing or anything else. Shaka for Aldo. Oh yeah. Soccer for all those bridges, sprinting, sprinting, they do.

Speaker 3:          01:39:57       And all the kicking they do in soccer. The learning how to move your body. Like look at what's going on with conor mcgregor that ido parked out there. He's concentrating so much on movement and movement is just a huge factor in his success because his ability to dictate like where first of all its ability to move in and out is better than almost anybody's. His ability to get out of the way and his ability to move in close and move like a fucking snake like is on the outside and boom he's in and he's in before you know it. And these, these complicated sort of tricky moves to try to time and follow. Very, very difficult guy to time. And a lot of that comes from constant application of all this movement theory and movement training. And like the more you can move your body any way you want, the more you're going to be able to move your body any way you want. And competition.

Speaker 5:          01:40:49       Absolutely. And you know, at the end of the day, like you said at the beginning of this a,

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       you can call it Tashi, Sfg Ido, as long as the coach, the coach is in the coaching charge, it really smart.

Speaker 6:          01:41:02       They understand how to map you down. That's good. Yeah. And in the Alamo that curse on, we're talking about what he's into his all plyometrics man. He barely has these guys lifting weights. He's got guys jumping over hurdles and stuff and doing all these leap, leaping back and forth and back and forth and back and forth like he's all about movement and in a plyometric way, in an explosive way. And that's one of the reasons why he gets such great results out of his fighters is because they, they developed this extraordinary ability to close the distance, extraordinary ability to get out of the way, you know, the ability to move and then to stop what you're doing. And then counter quickly, you know, all that stuff is just so giant cross fit fit into everything we're discussing right now because every studio city is the fucking capital crossfit might know you can't go anywhere in studio city without seeing five guys my age rather than down the street with a 50 pound plate over the head. And I'm sitting there going, something's not right here. What do you think

Speaker 4:          01:42:02       I've done in my what I think, you know, I think crossfit at the beginning as brilliant idea, it was bringing back a lot of things. They were disappearing like Olympic weightlifting and gymnastic and stuff. So I think it was good. You started to ruin the things when the games came is when this become a really an official sport and people that just get crazy, you know, it's a competition. So they just training with that goal. I need to beat the time, I need to be depth things and they don't understand, you know, this is going to kill you at that speed, that, that timing. It's going to be too much. Yeah. But it needs 10. Those ligaments and muscles at times to adopt, and if you take an hour, a weightlifter, he spent an entire life to do devcon to learn that kind of moment perfectly.

Speaker 4:          01:42:49       Never, never screw the movement and how many reps he does in his competition. One can die. He can do that kind of a movement so fast, you know, even if you lose the weight because you can control one to three reps, then you might be using app. I was talking to Michael. Michael was one of the most successful crossfit coach, especially here in southern California. He used to have on as a big crossfit gym and in vanize so and it was telling me about he has more experience with me. Of course. Cross with that was his business told me, I believe that if you do, you do when you are 20 years old or something like this into the 30, you can speak a little bit. Then if you are smart enough, you understand that, then you need to slow down. If you train cross without thinking cap time, try to see online how much this guy did.

Speaker 4:          01:43:40       So I want to beat this guy and just training smartly. You do your weight lifting your rings and when it's got to be good it's going to be, but if you just to as a sport is just conditioning you for that part such as crossfit. You can conditioning Fujitsu, try to do at crossfit would with a cap time because like you say, you're going to be destroyed saying cup time. What does that mean? Now in our captain is like, okay, you're supposed to do this and let's say word Wod, workout of the day, kind of the entertainers. Let's say you're supposed to finish in 30 minutes. Really? You made me, for me, it take 25 minutes, about 25 minutes because I know that I can control my movement and not going to get an injury, but most of the people they go online because now there's want to see how much time and it was telling me is crazy.

Speaker 4:          01:44:32       They need to rebuild the site, the website, and put more, more, more power because people, they go when they wake up in the morning, you're going to see, okay, what is the word of the day this time? Then when they go, they go to work, they're going to go online again and see, okay, east coast is already probably did all right. That's the average time. Alright, so I'm going back the time and I finished work. They go online again to see, okay, now east coast, this time now I go to the gym, I try to do and put my time in the day. In the evening I go like to see if someone beat me. So they go into this loop thing that they want to compete, compete, compete for time, and you're going to kill yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:45:11       Well, Steve Maxwell said that he believes that when you're doing is when you're lifting and you're doing these Olympic lifts, you should be doing a live make lefts to get you stronger for another sport, for a competition. He doesn't believe that it should be a sport in itself. Right. And he also said that I don't, he doesn't believe in Olympic lifts for high repetition. He's like, you're. It's just a recipe for injury because if you're doing cleans and presses, he goes, you watch Olympic lifters, they do one wrap, right? Yeah. They're not doing it 30 times in a row and you know it. Can it be done? Yes. You know what else can happen? You could drop that weight on your head and die because your body's failing because you're, you know, you did 14 reps and everybody's going, come on, come on Alberto. One morning and your arms just literally give out. And that thing paralyzes you. That has happened. It has happened.

Speaker 4:          01:46:03       It's about, like you're saying, it's the sport. So if you want to do a game show competition, you need to train that way, need.

Speaker 3:          01:46:09       Well there's guys that can do it. And they do do it. You know, there's those rich froning guy that has the winds that every year there's guys that can do it and they do do it. But you, the person who's listening to this, the average human being, you are way better off following like a strong first method, you know, or like your method or Pavle teaches where you're, you know, you, you lift the weights, but you don't go to failure. Use great technique. And if you want to get endurance, run up a fucking hill. Okay, go do rounds on a heavy bag. You want endurance, do sprints and a heavy bag. You know what I do? I have a timer and it times, etc. For three minutes and every 30 seconds a buzzer goes off. So there's a bell and then every 30 seconds is a buzzer.

Speaker 3:          01:46:52       And when those 30 seconds hit eat Fucking sprint. So it's 30 seconds, boom, boom, boom, boom. Just go fucking crazy for 30 seconds and the next buzzer hits. So the next 30 seconds is so light and the next 30 seconds I'm just sorta going through the motions. I'm kicking and punching, but, and I'm waiting for that fucking buzzer and that buzzer goes off. And then I go off again. They just do that. If you want endurance, that'll give you phenomenal endurance, but strength I am of the opinion, and this is just from the last few years of me operating this way, that you should do low repetitions and he should do it more often.

Speaker 5:          01:47:27       Absolutely. I agree with you. That's what I do for me. And I got better. I got stronger than before and I, and I, I took my hormone truck, trucker and understand I took my cortisol level test and a lower lower just to train like that. Your stress lower wraps? No, no.

Speaker 3:          01:47:46       How do you schedule your own personal workouts? Do you, do you have someone do it for you or do you decide based on how your body's feeling,

Speaker 5:          01:47:53       do, uh, do to myself. I did to myself and it's dependable. I have my schedule about a much driving. I need to cover a specific topic, a lot of traveling, talking about that, that's an issue. For example, just for january, from january 10 now I've been in Australia and being back in Italy. Then I went back to Brazil, Brazil, back to Italy, Italy, Panama, Panama, Mexico, Mexico. Yet. Then I go back to it and then I go back to Korea. Oh jesus, it's happening this week. I'm here next week. I'm in maybe new in Australia. And so it's crazy for me. That's why I really very careful about the way they're trained and sleep too. I bet. Right. fucks with your sleep and all that traveling. So then like I was telling joy, uh, used a lot of melatonin, of course, melatonin, phosphatidylserine to reduce my cortisol level, you know, try to try to plan, okay, I'm going to land in this place. The time zone iS different and try to adjust my meals or the time zone, you know, tied to my training so I can set up. It's pretty complicated for me to stay in decent shape and debrief vitamins with you. Yeah, I guess I got vitamin c and vitamin d and he a lot. And uh. What about like as far as your diet, like what do you concentrate on? do you concentrate on eating a lot of vegetables? I actually try super green on greg because you take it with you.

Speaker 5:          01:49:27       I don't like greens someplace you go. It's crazy. Didn't you ask for veggies, they all the things that gave you? Yeah, it's a couple of things that's easy for me to put it in my shake or whatever. Water, vegetables, so god damn. Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:49:45       so important for people and so many people, they don't have it in

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       their diet. They mess up and your body just does not have those nutrients and it starts drawing them out of your body. It takes it out of your bones. It takes out of your muscle and also you're just not recovering correctly. You're not developing correctly. What do you get your produce? Trauma. I mean, that's the dumbest question. Tomatoes don't taste like tomatoes no more, joe. Well, that's because the tomatoes that you get in the grocery stores are designed to last longer. They're not designed to taste good. Oh, but I could if you do as much as I got up yesterday, early one kind of forum. I try as much as I can mean I can't. I crave tomatoes, heirloom tomatoes, joy, they look ugly. They taste amazing. No, I got it. They only last like a few days. A few days ago. That's the problem because they're real tomatoes, they're not these fucking franken tomatoes, tomatoes.

Speaker 6:          01:50:33       They're hard and they're pale. It cut into them like, what is this a tomato or is this an app? Like, what the fuck is this? It's weird and you know that they only do it so that they could keep them on those trucks longer and drive around the country with them and keep them on the shelves and the grocery store produce yet. Yeah, we grow our own vegetables, tomatoes, we grow tomatoes, we grow kale, squash, we grow cucumbers. We grow a lot of things. Yeah. I think, um, if you can, you should do it. It's, it's very satisfying to make a salad out of something that you grew yourself and just super healthy, you know, where it came from, you know, we buy real healthy fertilizer, good soil, you know, and I think good soil is really important to. Um, I hAve a friend who lived in brooklyn and he got a soil tested.

Speaker 6:          01:51:19       It turned out that the ground was contaminated with lead from back when they used to have lead gasoline when they had leaded gasoline. Like all that shit goes up in the air and it all comes down, it's in your soil and it was in his soil and there's different plants that you could plant that will draw it out of the soil. Or the best solution I think is if you have a yard, just get potted plants, just get those big wooden boxes and grow the plants in there. That's the best way because then you can completely control what soil they grow in. And then, you know, it's, it's just a very contained environment. So that's how we do it. We have these big potters and you know, we grow watermelons and all kinds of course, because that would be my world to become an old italian man.

Speaker 6:          01:52:04       Roll up your pants, get a synagogue and oh, I'd love it. I love it right now. Over right now everything's so green out here. It's so amazing. Beautiful. Because it's amazing. It's amazing. He's been around in there like crazy. Yeah. We had a drought for five years and then this year it's just been flooded. They had a giant break of a dam in sacramento. Oh yeah, that's true. I was in Panama. What happened? Yeah, it's fucking awesome. Awesome. There's this thing called the glory hole. The morning glory hole up northern California. It'S this crazy hole that's in this lake and it hadn't operated in 10 years. It hadn't been doing it because it's like this, like a vortex, like a, what do they call those when it spins like that? What do they call it? A textbook. So it's sucks this whole somehow or another when the water level gets to a certain point, it develops as whole.

Speaker 6:          01:52:59       And this lake and it wasn't there for 10 years and now it's finally back again for the first time. Oh yeah, there it is. Isn't that nuts? That's crazy. Yeah. So for 10 years the water level wasn't high enough for that actually to be happening and now it's finally happening again. People were all excited, so it's pretty much over all of the. The drought issues that we had here in California are pretty much all tell this fucking guy, I don't care what tv they get this get rid of this god that we were waiting on this other tv for so long. Tell him today, say, just get whatever the fuck you can get by saturday because we have a fight companion on saturday. We can't have this happening. Um, but anyway. Yeah. So you take a protein protein? Honestly, no, I very rarely to protein if I have to, like if I'm running and I'm low on food, I haven't eaten anything but I know I'm going to work out.

Speaker 6:          01:53:51       Um, I like hemp protein because I can take like a glass of hemp protein with coconut water and I could, I could work out in 30 minutes, like no problem because it digests so easily. It's Just goes right into your system. So easy. It's a nice light. It's only, you know, you're only dealing like 16 grams of protein. It's nothing too crazy. But most of my protein I get from meat or real food. That's what we were discussing in the car. Yeah, I do. If I'm on the plane and I didn't get the chance to cook my food and things of the plane, man, I got some product. But otherwise I like to get some old food. If I knew I was traveling and I couldn't get it, I bring a lot of bars with me. I bring these, um, there's a company called primal kitchen.

Speaker 6:          01:54:33       This guy mark sisson, and he makes these. Yeah, he makes these amazing bars because they're very low sugar. So when I called five grants sugar. Yup. He's got the coconut. He's got um, cashews and coconuts. He's got almonds and dark chocolate. This is there some back therapy, more trouble by god. He's got a coconut dog. He's got a vanilla coconut meal replacement. Oh yeah. It's very good. I could drink this at seven in the morning. Me smoke and eat till two. I don't need to have to jujitsu a drink. That protein powder because I mixed them up. I used to have, I use that, like if I have a long, like today I drank the cocoa because I'm not going to be out of here till two. You sent me hungry. You see me fidgeting? No, it's the real fucking deal. The key is low sugar.

Speaker 6:          01:55:24       That is the key to eliminate as much sugar in your diet. And by the way, folks, that includes fruit juices, if you thinking that you're drinking a big glass of orange juice in the morning and it's healthy. So worst thing ever. It's so crazy. We thought that was healthy for so long. For so long we thought, oh, I'm drinking a nice healthy orange juice. Squeezed through that whole scenario. they may see, oh, we got cereal. I don't need carbohydrateS. Sugar. The more sugar you can cut out of your diet, the better. And sunday is my cheat day. Yesterday I had pizza. I had a cuban sandwich. I had a q, a cuban sandwich that uh, um, it was a fucking delicious. What is, it wasn't the movie right in the cif chef? Yes. But I didn't see chef. But what a chef. They had a cuban restaurant in movies.

Speaker 6:          01:56:10       That was that movie with bradley cooper. Is that three people shot? Oh, he makes up a food truck, a soul food truck. I love with bradley cooper. Something else with him now. No one saw that movie. He didn't even see that movie. Somebody pulled the people that made the people that edited that movie fell asleep. That's a unique thing on my page. Joe, you got to show you. They put this thing about a restaurant in New York city. It's called. I've been there. I've been there. It's called like golly, that is the last cuban chinese restaurant and really excited states, cuban chinese. Joe, you got to. They have one last and his name is antonio wong and the guy joe, you got to put the thing. I'm pleased. So there's a. there's a chinese community is huge. The biggest chinatown before fidel chinatown on the outlets outside of China, but the people that were born there started talking chinese in Cuba.

Speaker 6:          01:57:07       So when I was growing up you had like, I'm fine. I cina which is the chinese bell on 57th and bergen line, but the real deal one was this last one called lacan either and yet somebody put it on my page yesterday and we will watch look at this, but they have. So they have a chinese eco bada [inaudible] yo yo, yo. Yo. Yo. Yo means what? They look at it fried bananas, fried rice. This is in New York? Yeah. See if you can find the video. Jim, and they put it on my facebook page. We need to go next time. We're in New York and we do all the time. When he was in New York, they're open killed too, but the restaurant already, by the way. You have Vietnam? Yeah, it was in Vietnam. They got photos of him, but before that I met him on the fucking beach somewhere before that he was entitled.

Speaker 6:          01:57:55       That was a month ago. He can't be somewhere else. Can anImal. He's crazy. His phone still off the hook. He was supposed to be back a month ago that nobody knows where he is. He's not coming back until may. May. May is one of the shoot. The shoot, is that what he said? He's not coming back to a man. I don't. I don't think. I don't. I don't think we'll see him next month or even hear from him next month. What a weirdo could you do that could you vanished for months and just not talk to anybody? None of this. He's not talking to any of his best friends were his best friends. He's not talking to us. Not talking to anybody. Maybe talking like one dude. Maybe he's got a confidant when duty calls up. Hey man, I'm only calling you see gabriel iglesias. Cool. What? What's he doing? Canceled this tour.

Speaker 6:          01:58:38       What? Why? Okay. This tool. But why do you cancel? Was trying to use. Looked at a headshot of myself. Ten years passed by don. That's what he said. So how about damon apolis app apple. this manager looked at me and said talk sense into him police. But what dId he say? What? What? What's this thought process? Just working too much. He worked. He needs to. He's joined a boxing class. He joined solstice classes. Really just wants to live. She just wants to live. They bought that new mustang. Joe. That that's a bad motherfucker. Which one? Which one did you go to? The one that they made 77 of them. Oh, the shelby gt. Three 50. How many horsepower? Pretty high. It's just too much shit that you don't really need. They only made 77 of them, so he's going to go, I'm writing this fucking cars and he's got a shit load of money.

Speaker 6:          01:59:27       Gabriel, he's got a shit load of cars so he's wants to do something with jay and they're got to drive cars and wave at people, goes out the window. You know, I've been thinking about this myself, man, because of my ufc contract is going to be up again. Uh, I only have, I do it one year at a time now. I used to sign these long ass contracts, like five years, but now I'm like, I'm not doing that anymore. I'm going year by year and I have to decide soon because my contract's up again in august. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I do too many things. I do too much. I work too much, you know, and the family really wears on it. And we were talking about date night on fridays. I got, I got the bill of lading sent that once they give you the bill of lading that makes sense over the, the act of the act of 2017 that the dea is household friday night.

Speaker 6:          02:00:17       His wives dog give a fuck about you. Stand up no more. I gotta get out here. I got a four year old that drives me crazy. So friday night's date, night to official. You know what man, you and I have been talking about this too, that in town it's maybe sometimes even best to not go out on the weekends and work because even though it's good to work and it's good to like get your standup and on the weekends everybody's there to see the big show. Right. But for us, especially now for me it's only a couple months. It's my special came out. And for you it's just a month and a half. Right. When did your special come out? Three months ago. December, right? Yeah. So for me it's three months to. Um, so when, when that happens, or four months when that happens, your shit comes out and then you're in this scramble mode where you're trying to create.

Speaker 6:          02:00:58       And what I like, what you're doing is you're going to these hole in the walls, goes weird places and show up and work your material out. And these joints, you go to the comedy store on a friday night, there's 400 fucking people. It's packed to the gills and everybody's doing their best 15 minutes over and over and over again. And one of the things that I noticed when I went there recently, a lot of these guys that aren't doing a specials, you know, there's a lot of young guys coming up in particular that they don't have any specials. They, they're not releasing any materials. So they're doing the same material every time. I see them for fucking years now, for two years when I've been coming there. There's certain comedians that have been doing the same act every time I work with them. So what they're doing is they're tightening up this hard 15 minutes and they're doing it all the time.

Speaker 6:          02:01:41       And you know how to do that 15 minutes. I don't think that's helping you. And I don't think it's a lot of ways is not helping me. They're like, what would really help? Because you do long sets on the road. If you go somewhere and you're doing an hour and you do have two shows on a friday, two shows on a saturday, that's what helps. That's where it's at. It's a the podcast. Because just the way my office building is, I don't, I can't go in there in the daytime and smoke a pound in the pot and played loud music. I just can't do it. And I don't want to do it. So I prefer to do it at night when I'm going to have a gun to my head. You know, if I come here at 1:00, joe, and we have to sit here till four, from three to four, I'm going to be fidgety or out of control because I'm thinking about that fucking traffic.

Speaker 6:          02:02:25       I want you to do podcast. I don't want you to think of nothing. I don't want you to think of nothing, bro. If you got a spot, don't do my podcast because we might go on a tangent. That's brilliant. Yeah, and you got to leave for a stupid fucking spot. I've no, don't do it that monday. Then I tried to do comedy two, three times a week, but now I'm doubling up. What do you do? You have a guest this wednesday for your podcast? Because I was supposed to do it. I'm supposed to do at one of these times. We'll figure it out. Tell me one so I could cancel whatever comedy I got you. Yeah. What days are you doing it? Mondays and wednesdays. So you got tonight? No, I'm not doing it tonight. How come? Because I did it last night. Uh, I did two yesterday.

Speaker 6:          02:03:03       Oh nice. Nice. Did the undercover cop finally. Oh, how was that joe fucking to be close to a killer for 18 months. We sprays sinai and your face. That's what he was doing. He was chasing this guy that was the ice man, right? He was chasing the ice man. So he had a medium and the iceman for the only reason why the ice made contact with him was because he heard he could get different guns and you know, he was atf. So when the ice man contacts me, he wanted sinai. So he kept saying bring me the sinai and then he was going to sell him arms. So for 18 months this guy had contact with this guy. I had met him, meet him at a diner, he said he would hold his gun, pointed right at him when he would meet with him under the table or under the table.

Speaker 6:          02:03:45       But you also had to sit outside. You always tell them to sit outside because he didn't want to be downwind of the sinai just in case he's because he just sprayed in your face, you're done. So he was always worrying this guy was going to ice them, like literally isom literally. Wow. And then he would kill it. You call me ice man. For people who don't know, he, uh, would kill somebody and then throw them in the freezer in his basement for like seven, eight months. So they disappear. And then he put them in this fucking basement and then he would toss the body somewhere so it confused the fuck out of people. They didn't know when the guy died because it would thaw out. And then they be like, why is this kind of frostbite on them? What the fuck is this guy's intestines? The fresh? Yeah, like his intestines were still fresh. Meanwhile the guy had disappeared six months ago, so they call them the ice man. And he kept these fucking people in his basement. You know how cold blooded you have to be the

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       you're going to sleep in your basement. You got to. Did he do in his basement? They have a warehouse where he has a warehouse in north bergen, New Jersey where I'm from right out newkirk. I got my dick sucked out their time by gabby. Right out there. I saw gabby driving on kennedy boulevard and I just stopped the and she goes, what do you need a ride like, gabby, can you suck my dick? She goes, get in good kid. And then, uh, he killed. Like is richard kuklinski right? He had killed the. I lived on, given that terrorists and on charles court there was a guy named mr. Softy. He had an ice cream truck and that was his partner until he killed him too. He killed all his fucking partners. He killed a lot of fucking people and he killed a lot of people for the gambino family.

Speaker 2:          02:05:25       Right. Wasn't that who? He worked for him, but he was doing shit that it just wasn't like. They asked them one time about he bought. He bought a bow and arrow. He bought a bow and arrow, one of the ones that you have like a gun across and the guy says, how do you know what was going to work? It was just go for a ride. There was a guy that light with a motorcycle helmet. He shot him right now, man just took off because it works. He was one of those dudes that just didn't care and that's what this guy was saying. Yes, it goes, you really don't know that this. He goes, that one day my kid was halloween and he had the horns on at the house and I had to tell the kit to take them off because in reality I was sitting across from this guy every day this guy would talk about murder, like the way you talk about lifting weights, like I shot him in the throat and he didn't really die. So I look at, you know, just shit that's just, you gave me that book, murder machine. You remember that book?

Speaker 2:          02:06:20       Jesus christ, that's a fucking scary book and it details this guy who was a um, a mob boss, was it in the seventies, in the seventies, and this, it details how he slowly started killing a bunch of people, like slowly but surely. And then they would cut them up in their fucking bathtub and then they had this one apartment where they would take these people to, that was above this bar that they would go to. They take these people upstairs and fucking kill him and they killed so many people. But you know, there were animals because it wasn't even for business anymore. It was like he disrespected me like it would listen to me called my sister fat. Really? You gotta walk them upstairs. They'd shoot them and stuff and they'd hang them and they'd cook. Yeah, and they'd wait for the body to drain. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:07:09       They would cut the neck and hang them and so that the blood would drain out of it. Go in and chop them up and put them around. Who does this shit fucking sleep at night. You know what I'm saying? I could see somebody calls you a motherfucking. You shoot them. Shit happens. You know somebody owe you $10,000. Somebody hits your sister with caught, but the just. They were just doing shit to prove that they were animals. That's animal shit. Well, I think what happens is you get used to doing it just like we were talking about fighting and the more you fight, the more you get comfortable with it. I think there's something that happens to people when they kill people. They get real comfortable with it and the more comfortable they get with it, the easier it is. And then they start getting a rush out of doing it and there's also this power to know that this guy walking around and you know, his wife thinks he's coming home and you're like, you know what, you're not coming home.

Speaker 2:          02:07:54       I'm going to just stop this right now. And that it's almost like they get a thrill out of playing god in a lot of ways. You know, he was, you know, I read the, before I spoke to him, he told me to read a different book. I had read a different book on the ice man. And he told me to read a different book. And again, this was our conversation earlier. What book did you read? Uh, it was, it was a different author. This one was by anthony, brutal called the iceman. The one I had read before, carl was by a different office. Something called up and they said he had, he had caught the iceman later when he had become more exaggerated, I killed kennedy because towards, do you have any killed everybody. He was dead when he found out that he was getting people's deckard.

Speaker 2:          02:08:39       So this guy wrote the early, when it's really weird, you know, his dad just beat the shit out of them, beat the shit out of the mother jersey city. Yeah. It just made him a monster, you know, there's no depth between jersey city and hoboken, new work, same animals. And he said that there was a kid that would always call them polk. He had to wear the same clothes to school every day. You had no money, you know, and uh, the kid caught, he described his first murder. You know how he got a stick and waited for the kid to come home. He was 14, you know, when you kill somebody at 14. I thought he killed a guy at a bar with a. I thought he killed a guy, strangled him. That was the member. He lit the one guy on fire like he wants.

Speaker 2:          02:09:19       But the first guy he got was this young guy and he wouldn't give his name. He beat him up with the two by four. And he went upstairs and the next morning the cops were outside. He thought he just drew a beating on him. He didn't know he killed him, so he was scared. He kept puking and he kept going to school and thinking that people would know and after that that's it. Once you get away with it, it's like a, what's the taste, the taste tastes in your mouth. And then he started going. He had an argument with a guy over pool and he beat him in the head with a pool cue 30 fucking times and then he got into another beef where he shot the guy outside, but we left the car on fire with the body in it. You know, the reason why there's so many unexplained.

Speaker 2:          02:10:00       That's because his first couple of years he was going out at night, you know, there was a time when I had four drinks and I go rob something you believe that just the drinks would get you feel loose. And like I was great until I had four drinks and then I'd be walking home, let's see, a store. And I kicked the door opening for some fucking reason, you know? Wow. He would go out and kill, can kill people at night, like go somewhere and let's see. He just insulted them for the weirdest thing, like, hey, get out of the way. He would wait for you outside and shoot you. So that's how he developed his things. Was that episode available now? Which one? The one with this dough. Put it up yet. When is that one going up this week I'm going to do a wraparound the router, because it was a phone call, right, so I just take the phone call was sunday and then we'll do a wrap around and compare it to the book.

Speaker 2:          02:10:47       He's a great guy. I really had a great guy. I mean I got to talk to him every day. He's like 70, but he's essex county. Went to the university of Nebraska, was a golden gloves champion, went back, became a state cop, then they became atf. Just a fucking great story. There was two guys that were talking about your podcast. It was fucking hilarious. They were talking about lee lee, cya, and they were like, what joey has done to that poor guy, and he's like, every time he sees him he's forcing them to eat mushrooms. He's got to take asset. He's given them pot. He's given them edibles. He's lied to them about the dosage. Lead. Loves it. He loves it. He does. He did the. We did that liquid acid with the ice cube with the sugar cubes. Jesus christ. But two weeks ago we did two nights in a row. Was hilarious on the show. He did it and then he called me the next day. He's like, that was fun. I went to cps at four in the morning. He wasn't like that before he met you though? No, but he's having a great to turn that kid into a freak. He's not a freak man. I turned them into a functioning savage,

Speaker 2:          02:11:52       but I love him. Like I love him with all my heart because he makes me. He makes me laugh so much joe. Like he just, you know, I'm 54. It's 28. He's half my age. Right. You know, I see life from his perspective, you know, and I'm like when you guys get along together, great. It's like a great dynamic. The two of you together, it works really well. Oh, I love it. I don't see him too much during the week so I keep the relationship fresh. We taught all the time. I torment them all. The dad called him. I go, what the fuck is wrong with you? It was, what are you talking to? My buddy just got a letter from the state. Why is your fucking phone tapped? I taught math them for 20 minutes about his phone, but why? Why? Why my boeing fleet that I go, do you work for the cia? Is that been made you come over and take my acid so you can report back?

Speaker 1:          02:12:38       What the fuck is wrong with you?

Speaker 2:          02:12:45       Don't worry about it must have been a mistake.

Speaker 2:          02:12:50       And the guy got me the liquid acid, right? I called him and I said, listen, I got a liquid ass. I mean you could hear him getting anxiety on the phone because I don't know. You could hear a little bit. And then he goes, how are we going to do it? I said, so we're going to get sugar cubes and put the acid on it. But I called them back. I a daily. I hadn't had no assets and I had no sugar cubes. I just made it up. I go, listen, I just put the acid on the cube sugar cubes and I put them in a tupperware and I put a lid on it and I left. And when I came back to lynn had blown up. So whenever that acid is going to be really fucking strong, I go, I put aluminum foil over.

Speaker 2:          02:13:26       It would hold so it could breathe. So the acid won't fucking go into. Oh my god. Had them gone for two weeks. I go to cleveland. Guess what? Some guy comes up to me, gives me a tube of this is the pharmaceutical grade shit. This will kill gaddafi. I go home, we put drops on his cue on need sugar cube. Oh my fucking god. Yeah. But see again, that's why I quit everything because my tolerance is too hot. Back in the deck of the two drops. Ipi for 12 hours, seeing things, unicorns. I seen something like two hours. But you, who knows what, how strong it really was to. And you're getting it from cleveland. You've got to get it from like northern California. Oh no, no. But then I lost. I lost the 10 sheet from a guy in england. A guy in england gave me some stuff. Pink floyd and I said this, the same one that syd barrett took when he quit pink floyd. So I took that. I saved that. So now I'm going to get the liquid acid. I'm going to put it on the blog or from pink floyd and we're going to go deep. I'm just saving that one for a good guest.

Speaker 2:          02:14:29       I like it. Well, let's wrap this up. Um,
