Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience.

Speaker 2:          00:03          And I think a lot of it comes down to that we shouldn't sort of protest what we shouldn't agree with, but we should build the things we should build a future that we do agree with. Um, so when you look at the past few hundred years of modernity and, and our civilization, what we see is dramatic positive trends in terms of health, wealth, education, violence, and we had steven pinker on your show, right? Yeah. Um, so I think that's really, um, yeah, really positive trends and we've done a good job in that and that all comes down to, uh, our ability to sort of imagine things that don't exist yet. So sort of technology and innovation and being able to work, uh, work together in an effective way, which is think about the corporation. Um, so, so I think those have been, um, yeah, sort of very good trends.

Speaker 2:          00:59          And I think what we should do is we should also think about how to apply those to the area outside of our own species and to the rest of the environment. Because when you look at all those positive trends over the past few hundred years, um, and then, yeah, that's all good, but there's one very big exception, which is the impact to the environment. It's almost like we've had all the success at the cost of the environment and, but I think that instead of it or some people that have sort of a more reactionary feel to this and they said, well, um, look at, uh, all these problems, it was created by businesses and by technology. So we should stay as far away from those things as possible. And I think that's sort of, um, you know, that's sort of stupid. I think that, um, it really just shows that these are very, um, powerful ways of getting things done.

Speaker 2:          01:51          And I think a much more effective way was to sort of apply that, what has worked in other areas and then also apply that to the area of the environment. So, so I don't think, you know, I, for example, think that the car problem is not going to be solved by banning cars, I think is going to be sold by electric cars. And I don't think the meat pollution problem is going to be solved by everyone becoming Vegan. I think it's going to be solved by things like lab grown meat and other kinds of alternatives. Um, so, and that's why I also think that, um, yeah, the ocean cleanup or the plastic pollution problem is not going to be solved by sort of people trying to do their own little bits and um, you know, trying to live without plastic or things like that I think is going to be solved by, um, you know, things like, uh, plastics that do not harm to the environment as well as technologies like the ocean cleanup to sort of clean up after herself. So, um, yeah. And I hope that the education can be a sort of a, as a symbol of that approach.

Speaker 1:          02:51          You had like one of the most spectacular fights with Jon Jones. I mean, down to the wire is as close as it gets. And when you get out of a fight like that, will, you almost won the title against the greatest of all time. Like, what is, what is that feeling like and where do you go from there? Uh, you know, it was tough. It was really tough because I know everybody was saying, are you winning this fight? Winning this fight? You have to be run this against him. Are you winning this fight? I, if it felt like, and like you said, it was something, it was just, it was just right there at the goal line. You know, I didn't really pass that goal nine at all. Um, I just felt like that it was tough. It was tough, but by, but like now I'm sitting here now talking to you.

Speaker 1:          03:40          It's a big, it's a really good experience for me. And, and in, I really, it's a good time for me. If I was, w is a highlight in my career for sure in my life, for sure. It was such a close fight when the, when the scorecards are being tagged and you, uh, you know, you're just sitting there waiting for the decision. Did you think you hadn't, you know, I didn't know. Right? I didn't know. I didn't know much chaos. Could you even remember what had happened over the last five rounds? I remember, I remember, I remember the, I remember the fight, uh, and I got, uh, I remember almost the whole fight, but it was just John. John's just such a basis. He, I'm telling you, just for me, John Jealous winning over John Jones is bigger than taking the belt. I'm telling him, that guy's the guy is such a beast and, and uh, yeah. What was the question?

Speaker 2:          04:34          No, it's okay to express yourself. That's fine. I mean, I agree with you. He is a beast. We had a little chalkboard sign out front that said Venison is the new Kale and you know, we get cute with our sign. We tease other restaurants around us like we have fun with the sign and it's fun. And uh, the cyclist Vegan rode by and took huge offense to our sign and all of a sudden one day these protesters just showed up. So, um, originally I was just kind of frustrated because they're totally misguided because, um, we take a lot of pride in where our food comes from. We have Vegan and vegetarian dishes on the menu. Uh, and I really respect that type of diet. So we were just totally floored with why this was happening. And, um, so this started to go on. They'd started come every week and they went from like two or three people being kind of peaceful to being like 10, 15 people, not so peaceful. So, uh, it's when it turned not so peaceful. They were shouting at our, at our guests and shouting in our door and really trying to harm our business. That, uh, I just kind of got fed up. Last resort went down, we get a hold dear a couple times a month and we, we butchered ourselves. And, uh, I just said, screw it. Screw it. I'm like, I'm going to get these people to get out of here. So I thought that that would make them go away.

Speaker 1:          05:54          How did you think that was gonna make it, make

Speaker 2:          05:55          them go away and not escalate it? Uh, I don't know. I was, it was just totally like last resort, a totally fed up. Um, I wanted to defend myself, defend our customers. You know, you could see people walking in visibly upset, um, you know, they're being shouted at being screamed at, called a murderer as they're walking in for dinner and like, you're going on a date, you want to hear this time and then people are screaming at you, uh, you know, just for eating. So, uh, I was just fed up and I just kinda thought like, you know, buzz off and why? So just one sign once I seen is the new Kale one sign set this whole thing off. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:33          I had those abilities. If I'm a kid growing up in this environment and I can't find refuge in my school, I can't find refuge at home because my mom's working three or four or five jobs. So she's never there. Where am I going to go find parents? I'm go, where am I going to find that pyramid to influence? I'm gonna find on the streets. So now I'm on the streets being led by people who grew up in exam tech conditions that I grew up in. And so now I'm like, okay, well I have to make money. What am I going to do for money? While then there's their knock old economy very conveniently, right? Therefore me, right? Sell drugs. So now I'm selling, now I'm standing on the corner selling drugs. I got to protect my product, right? If I don't, someone's gonna take it from me.

Speaker 1:          07:11          So what do I do? I get a gun, I carry a gun. Now I'm stuck in this situation. Now I'm just stuck in this violent loop, right? If that feeds on itself. And so now I'm stuck defending myself against the guy who's shooting at me, trying to take my stuff and I'm shooting back in him. Maybe not because I'm trying to take care of stuff, but because he's trying to take them on, right? So that's where you get that violence that comes from that, from those particular areas. Now, if we would've sat back and said, okay, we have hyper concentrated areas in this country. This is a widespread, it's hyper concentrated communities in this country that are dealing with this, that are also the result of the vast majority of our gun violence. And we sat back and thought about it from a socioeconomic standpoint.

Speaker 1:          07:52          How do we fix this? What do we do? How do we present opportunity? I'm not saying going in and just hand out stuff, but how do we fix this from the standpoint of improving our schools? How was I can drive five minutes, one direction and have a school that has everything you can name and then driving and the driving the opposite direction the school has can barely have textbooks to give to their kids. Think about that. So why, why aren't we focusing our energy on building that up versus talking about, oh we need to get the guns off the streets. You did that. You have that in Chicago. You have every gun law imaginable in Chicago, but yet southside Chicago still looks the way that it does still has a violence that it does, right? So if we would, if we provide, when you give people something lose or the lift for, they don't throw away life so easily.

Speaker 1:          08:39          Plain and simple. So if my social economic status is in the dirt, I don't have a problem looking at another kid down the street and shooting at him and taking his life. I don't have anything. I don't have anything to lose, but if we would focus our attention in fixing, same way we talk about the mental health issue with respective mass shootings and school shootings, we wouldn't have to worry about the guns because we won't have people wanting to do those things or have the capability to do those things. Right. So then that deals with that vast majority of the violence that we had. They're focusing that energy in fixing those communities. The point of the story was this, Isis came around and people were suddenly like, oh my God, where did this come from? Of course, those of us who had been monitoring the situation knew this was going to come back around very, very heavy.

Speaker 1:          09:26          Now that isis has been pushed back. And this is where this story is sort of the point of the story is we've got to resist the temptation to believe the problem has been solved because the, the organization known as Isis, which isn't a bureaucracy has been fought back, but the ideology upon which that organization was built, um, is still very much alive and it's still strong. Um, what al Qaeda did while the whole world was focused on Isis was exploit that opportunity to rebuild and regroup and they'd been rebuilding in Syria. Now they are stronger than they have ever been even under binladin because for the first time in the history of that organization, they are firmly embedded within the Syrian population as a genuinely kind of viewed by the people that they were fighting on behalf of as a grassroots resistance organization. Where's it before that, they were seen as a terrorist group that was like a, you know, just like a vanguard.

Speaker 1:          10:19          They've embedded themselves in the Syrian population, in the Yemeni, uh, civil war. They've embedded themselves in north Africa, east Africa, and in Pakistan. And they are resurgent and they are grooming a Hamza bin Laden who was been not in Sun. Um, and the grooming him for leadership and, and as an a time will come maybe in a couple of months, maybe in a couple of years where they announced Hamza bin Laden as a new leader of al Qaeda currently at Saint Monzo. Ari, when they do that, once they grooming has been complete and assuming Hamza isn't killed, uh, up until then, all of the fragments of what remains of Isis will probably rejoin al Qaeda under Hamza bin Laden. And you'll have a stronger than ever before Al Queida Organization. And we've got to, we've got to remember that we never expected isis to emerge. Hokkaido. We'll come back with a vengeance.

Speaker 3:          11:15          Okay.
