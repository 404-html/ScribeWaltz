Speaker 1:          00:00:07       The Joe Rogan experience podcast by night. I need a new song. It's time. 600 episodes. I think it's that you haven't had that for the first hundred. Yeah, whatever. 500 maybe. It's great. I love it. I used to like the, uh, tell Nick Diaz that if he doesn't win then you've got to get a new theme song because I will never take his, his voice off the theme song. We'll do a neat new theme song and incorporate his voice. That was the one of the coolest moments in my life. You kidding me? He's got his hands up in the air. It's like train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night. I was like, that's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me next to the birth of my children. It's right up there. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       So, uh, we're all here because we're friends and this is an intervention Dunkin. I know you thought this was a podcast masturbating. You're gonna. You're gonna. Have to tell them about the demons. Tell them what happens when. I don't know if we know those Jews. Know that when people masturbate, they're actually fucking beaman. That's on top of you that you can't even see when you come. It comes into her belly and you have demon babies. The only way to get the Jews out of my body as to jerk off Jews really bleeding and the only way to get the juice out of your body is a jerk off. Oh, you have to get possessed by demons and they swell up in my chest and they caused my penis to expand and to change shape. You know what I'm talking about? When inside of a shape, it's very strange. I've seen that comes like this. Tape up marshmallow guy so you get demons to sexy movie. The only thing that gets the demon out is if I jerk off a Semitic man, then when I do that, I see the demon come out of my penis in the form of this white, salty substance. Either it goes back to normal. Your penis stays like crazy, crazy aggressive. It's always screaming howling at night.

Speaker 1:          00:02:23       So we're here. This is not happening. The new show on comedy central or should fear officially a baller, just had his new comedy central hour special, paid regular and that was the coolest shit man. The comedy store was tweeting photos of the red band tweeted some to of the patio, the field. Everybody out there watching your special on tv while you were performing in the or. That was the craziest picture. Jeff Scott Show Shit onstage live at this store and on standby special was from that same stage and you know what's even cooler? People come to see you now. I think your new material now. Some of the best shit you've ever done. It's right up there with the best bits you've ever done. The new show that you're doing now. That stuff you did in Vegas. It's fucking great man. It's really funny. Shit without telling anybody to have it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:11       Say a good eight minutes. Eight minutes. That's all right dude. Keep swinging. I'm really good about 40 right now, but it's 40 that I don't. I don't know it that well. That was still a ever evolving like these, like Jarvis Jarvis, Jarvis. He's just say the bits where like, I'm like cooling metal or cooling honey, so it was like real fluid and then as it gets cooler it like more and more shape until it becomes like the same thing every time. It's cool. Yeah. I remember that. I never, I don't remember total talent coordinator. You told me that. That's an interesting way to look at it. I've always felt that they grow though always felt that there are living thing and it becomes sturdy. Like they started off as like little saplings and they're like, oh, sometimes they look impressive and sometimes they come. Sometimes they come out, they're fucking trees.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       There's certain bits that I've done that we're already a tree before they ever got to the stage, like the Vegan bit. That was just on my last special. I wrote that bit all after one conversation. Did you name that bit? Jamie Kilstein to Jv. Kelsey and Jamie Kilstein, believe it or not, even though he talks a lot about being a Vegan, he's not preachy about it and he also admits it. He ate a lot of meat. He's a bad example that Jamie Chelsea gets a bad rap and part of it's because the conversation that he and I had on the show, but he's not, he's not a bad conversation. I don't remember if he's out there listening.

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       Jamie Kilstein. I think you're a good dude. I really do. I think he's a, he's a genuinely like what he's trying to do. He genuinely thinks he's doing really good things and he's just, it was about the um, the Daniel Tosh rape thing. Daddy touched me that joke where he asked the audience what they wanted to talk about. Some guy yells out rape and Daniel Tosh start saying like, oh yeah, what a great subject. Like, what's so funny about rape is it, the humiliation is the violence. Some woman says, actually, nothing is funny about rape. And he goes, wouldn't it be funny if five guys just rape her right now? And it became this big, sent me. Well, first of all, that's the kind of shit that happens at a goddamn comedy club. No, we all know that. And the guy's just trying to be funny while he's on his toes. On a stage in the spur of the moment, that's what to me it's like a non issue, so jamie and I disagreed with it heavily because he felt like the lazy and he felt like your contributed to rape culture, which is a term that gets bandied about. It's a. it's a weird term. Some people think it's horse shit term, you know? There is no rape culture.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       The real thing. That's why if you say the Indian comics from India and stuff, they're super rape joke. He comes out and they're consistent gang rapes. No, that's all. That's pretty much all our comics just talk about rape and gang rape and then it

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       really in the ecommerce peters from Houston, they're Indians. They're brown is fuck barrier. Our Indian garment for sure, until they have a seat stay. There's giant movie industry. Their movie industry is bigger than our movie and Super Porny, right. It's not always long sex scenes and those considered juggling a fruit and singing in between a gun fighting movies still have a musical numbers where they will start in the middle of a real action movie. When I went to, we would take volume and go to this movie theater in New Delhi and just watch their movies because there's so trippy. But yeah, in the middle of like an action movie, uh, it'll stop and do a musical number that, like a real serious action movie. Why? It's just their culture did like it. They like it. They like that style of to will mean we used to like it.

Speaker 3:          00:07:03       And if you go back and try to watch those old Oklahoma, well all those, like gene Kelly movies, there was start dancing in the streets, but he would stand there and people would dance around them and they had music videos at broke out in the middle of a movie. So they have also applied to put it. Yeah. They have all these plots. They have real language. They're real dialogue. They have a real storyline. You see like why there wouldn't be singing about, well, it's someone's desire, the one person's desire in the middle of a gigantic performance where people are interacting with each other. It's one person's desire to totally steal the spotlight. And the best way to do that is by saying everybody has to stand around and listen while John, like we're all like support. We're in the back and John's in the century snapping.

Speaker 3:          00:07:53       Yeah. And he's got this great point and we're all like, wow, yeah, senior angle above live and everyone's letting him move around and nobody stops and go, what are you fucking doing man? Like why are you saying like nobody interacts with them. There's no interacting. It's just this one guy, which is what the theater to some folks. It's all about that moment on stage holding the stoll. Who Got Paul? Reminds me, man, I got a million dollar idea. What's a found footage musical like this found footage? Movies. But they find one where like people are actually real music. You know, music is playing. They just start saying, hey, like what? The flare. That will be great. Really bad songs. But Linda's choppy video, it's totally happening right now. I've got another. I've got a great idea to do with it of an improvised musical reality show, but they gotta

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       do it. That's a great idea. That's a great idea to bring them into a situation and the audience doesn't know, so they have to. They're are people going to interact with them to sing out to this restaurant or bar? Have you ever seen the video? There's a video with this bringing you back to a activists that get that. Sometimes ms dot point. There was a video of this lady, she steps into a chicken restaurant and she starts talking about this is not food, this is violence, you know, and there's a little girl and her saying and she just wants to live. She just wants to be happy and she just wants to live and this little girl was going to die just like all of her sisters and all of her brothers and her family chicken a chicken and she rescued this, this chicken. And so she just like videos of the same gal with her chicken at home, you know, it's like.

Speaker 2:          00:09:50       So she goes into a restaurant and disrupts all these people and like tells this whole story and then explains that it's hurt our chicken and then a whole crew of assholes come in behind her with signs. This is not food. It's violence. It's so weird. And they're like, we're just running a restaurant. Did it seems like a parody. It seems like someone is just bad ass. Some Tim and Eric type dude really just put together some bad ass parody that's so subtle. You like not sure like is this bitch really this crazy that she's referring to this chicken as her girl?

Speaker 4:          00:10:23       So it seems sometimes that like activists aren't aware of the fact that if they're stumped isn't pulled off in the right way. It seems like it could be more detrimental comes off course, you know, like people will, their response is going to be too rude to eat more chicken people. Yeah. Just because you're like, I don't want to be associated with this kind of behavior and if that means eating chicken, then I guess I'll eat more chicken. So it's like it's, it's dangerous to be an activist if you are not really subtle or if you're aren't skillful in what you're doing. Like being an activist is awesome. Just make sure that you're graceful when you do it

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       well. Not only that, you have to have a real objective sense of what actions you're putting out there and how those actions are going to be perceived. If you fake it, you can see through and it seems lame. Well, there's some people that have this idea that their idea, what they're protesting against is more important than anything that's going to disrupt anything that's going to involve that. Like Greenpeace Greenpeace did with the Nazca lines. Oh yeah. They fucked him up so fucking crazy. He's dumb ass holes. Went to the Nazca lines and they set up a graph, looks unethical, Nazca lines. So these, they don't even know how old they are. Okay? There are thousands of years old. These law. Meanwhile I'm like, because we know how old they are. You just revealed that you're an immortal. They've dated more than a thousand years. Whatever it is. They're all sorts

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       of geometric patterns, animals, all sorts of different things. Some of them are animals, some of them are spiders were all these weird patterns you can only see from the sky patterns. Okay, I'm sorry. So there are patterns that are in their patterns are made on these flat plains and some of them are just a bunch of rocks that are pieced together in these lines and people have left them undisturbed because they're so cool forever. So you can't just go there and walk around on them. You can't fuck these assholes went there and they use some of the stones as paperweights. They pick some of the rocks on the ground or they go to sign up this fucking stupid green peace sign. Oh, see that? Pull it. You got a photo of it, Jamie? Put up with Dick's. Yeah, but so douchey. And because a lot of what Greenpeace does is really good, which stop people from killing whales. Remember lines of just. There's photos. Jamie go to photos. Greenpeace Nazca lines the seal outside of a store. GRANDPA's. So look what these assholes did.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       See, see how cool that that design is, that pattern, that pattern has been there for. That just naturally happened in the time. Oh right. And they were, they were using stones from that to put their sign with the, with the foot thing. So they weren't disturbing people. I don't know what the fuck they think they're doing. They're still disturbing it by doing that. Like sometimes standing on that, look, you're fucking footprints are also in that paper. I could see the bottom of your tread. You know what that means. That means you stand. You stood on that shit. You stood on that shit somewhere and I'm supposed to believe that you're doing this all ethically. You're not fighting fire. They shouldn't have done that. It backfired. And that sucks because all the people who are doing good work look like assholes. Exactly. That sucks. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       So this is, this is the actual of those are the lines like that? Yeah. Yeah. What makes them. We don't know. They don't know who made them. They really don't know that shit. Wow. That kid. That's not, that's not just like movement, like a kinetic movement. Right? Oh No, no, no, no, no. These are mad that someone. Definitely. Definitely. Without a doubt. Is that in sand or is that in stone? This is so funny. Some people think that the geometric ones could be indicated flow of water that's connected to rituals to summon water. Spiders, birds, plants. Could be fertility symbols. Other possible explanations include a irrigation schemes or giant astronomical calendars. Why isn't everyone trying to figure it out? That looks like a bird. Yeah, well they're definitely trying to figure it out. There's a dog. There's a monkey. The monkey. No, pull up the monkey. Jeremy.

Speaker 1:          00:14:41       They're so good. There's a date. There's a sport. There's this binder that looks like. What's his name? If you, you'll find you'll find a monkey down there and there's a monkey and one of them. It's really cool. It's got like A. There's a, there's birds which bird feet and shit. There's a gang of. I didn't bill cosby and ecstasy get makes them like that. It's weird to see the images that people. Do you remember when they used to do that with a. whether they would code certain words in the websites. It's like a person that porn porn porn. Funny, funny. People think it's an alien. That thing, that person with the eyeball, so click on that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:19       Well, yeah, but I mean that's how my daughter draws people. You know, everybody says it's an alien. It's an alien. Well, maybe maybe somebody might be a giant two year old, might be really shitty artists for thousands of years. The shitty artists, the jetty. Like I had this conversation with this dude who was trying to tell me, but you know, these images on cave walls, we're, we're, you know, aliens, depictions, valence like Graham Hancock, who I love. But it was like, come on man, I might not be an alien. That can be a lot of shit. These people, if they want to believe in, and not only that, but it was thousands of years ago. Just what they saw back then was aliens. That's when they pull up the monkey, Jamie, and you just see this monkey see monkey because it's really cool. It's got a curly tail is go down a little bit, go down a little bit more and more and more and more and more and more.

Speaker 3:          00:16:18       Start up a little up.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       We got it. It's gone. It was a dog to the left. Do you see that? One of the far left, Jamie. About three down. Oh, it's okay. Just let's try to find a monkey.

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       Whereas that monkey. Where's the fucking monkey? The monkey from us? No. Well, if you go to the Wikipedia, you could see the month. Here's the cool. Here it is. So it's like it's puking or it's on the wikipedia. If you go to the Wikipedia, look at them like, oh, that'll look. You can see it there. It's enormous. How big is a person to toe? I don't know. That's a good question. That's a very good question, but they're really big. I mean you, you see when those people were walking around, I mean digitally, they were laying that out. It looks like it was drawn like with a finger on a tablet or something. It doesn't look like a shit ton of people spend a long time look. The tail kind of wore out. They've had some damage with mud slugs to apparently. Yeah, they. But they, they really. There's all sorts of explanations, but nobody goes there. They just look at it and then the Greenpeace people want. They're aliens came, visited these people, gave them like showed them some incredible shit. They left. The people want them to come back. So they draw these shapes on the ground and hoping that our attorney, it's classic cargo cult behavior. That's where it all is right in the same place in Peru. Yeah. Yeah. This one area,

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       it's really fascinating also because there's what looked like landing strips there as long parallel lines. They want them to come back. That's what it is. That's got to be. That's what it is. Doesn't have to be. It could be. They just know. They just figured out how to draw it in the ground that you can see from the sky. Maybe they just thought it was an interesting way to do something that they couldn't see your will. They could. They just couldn't see it really well, you know, you can only really truly see what it is when you're up above it, but I mean it's not impossible that they could measure it and do it all on the ground. I'm just proposing being the devil's advocate, like it's not impossible that they did those. You could see the ground. I mean, you're looking down at your feet.

Speaker 2:          00:18:32       It's not like you're invisible to you to help. You do like 12 mile wide monkey sabic. They're not that big. They're not that big. They're a few hundred feet wide. I think the really big ones, but there's not like 12 miles long or anything crazy. Maybe I do it the lines themselves or they're superficial. They're only 10 to 30 centimeters deep and could be washed away really. So that's why nobody goes there because I'll wear it down. It's only ever received a very small amount of rain, but there's issues also that the great changes that we're seeing to the climate that it might start raining. They're not fucked crops. Well, at least you know, everybody's like really hooked up crops ever, but everyone will be better than the stupid lines. Right. But everybody's really localized. They have it in their head that, you know, this, um, that this site is like, it's super important.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       But we have all the images, like once we have the images, if the water comes in, washed everything away, at least at least we've documented. We know these people made these things. We don't know why or when, where they think it's the nascar culture, which is like, I think it said here, 400 to 650 add. So they lived there and maybe carve those things they think. So that's over a thousand years ago. That's, you know, more than it as, as much as 1500 years ago. Go to work and show it could be longer. Crazy shit man. They don't really have any explanation for why. But there's a lot of. I mean, you could, it could be aliens, right? I mean if we can go to Mars, man, we can send a robot. Tomorrow's. It's so arrogant to think that we're the only ones that could do that. I've never seen any evidence whatsoever that's even remotely compelling that aliens have visited here.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       None of it. None of it. That's outside of other. There's not one thing that stands out. We say that had to be aliens. It couldn't have just been really smart people. Now one thing and why would any of them left anything? Well, it might've. It might've when, when we're looking at the pyramids, when we might be looking at is someone's knowledge and information from another culture. Well done. The pyramids somehow point to serious, serious sort of, sort of. Well it depends. He said there's a thing called the procession of the. So the earth spins. Yeah, right. You know, it's like, it's, there's like a wobble to the earth and so when you see this, the stars, it's not always the same and it, it wobbles like, you know, every x amount of thousands of years. So depending upon where you think these were constructed, you would have a different star line.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       You'd have a different thing that you would see. There is a guy named John Anthony West who's just amazing when it comes to this shit, his whole video series. It's called magical Egypt. So good if you've never been. I mean it's like if you're not even interested at all in Egypt, like, yeah, that's fucking boring. Bunch of people living in the sand like assholes if you want, if you want one of these videos. I would love it if I was high. I was just trying to be funny. I would say that. But um, his videos are super in depth about the construction methods and how big it is and like all the magical things about the way they built them, they think that it was a culture that lived a long fucking time before. We think not just like $2,500 per se, but like he's of uh, the, the, the notion that it's like 10,000 plus BC and if you go to 10,000 BC apparently where the lion is a sphinx, where it's pointing would be directly over the Constellation Leo.

Speaker 4:          00:22:07       Oh, I like the serious theory. Better the dog star. It's like Robert Anton Wilson. Crazy idea that, uh, that we are possibly currently existing in the serious star cluster in what we're having this experience of reality pumped into our consciousness as a form of training for something like Matrix pods, pods, and that there is like, so there's like clues left in the simulator pointing back home and just to just as a little cookie like you even video games, you know, or maybe people a long time ago or more aware of the fact that this is a inner interdimensional academy at kind of hogwarts for young God links who are trying to like, who have the potential to become like universe creators. But before they're elise to like create their own dimensions. They have to go through this infinite loop again and again and again until you learn that the most important thing is to love the people around you more than you love yourself. And then boom, and then you can be a god. Well, yeah, then you can then we can trust you to fuck around with like our black hole machine or whatever. I'm not going to put you in charge of black holes while you're a selfish shithead.

Speaker 2:          00:23:26       Yeah. That always seems to me like if that was really like a plot, if someone had designed like people with this sort of like puzzle in front of them, the plot is eventually they're going to get intelligent enough to figure out the plot. That seems to me to be like a really shitty way of doing things. There's God that's like various. Tell them how do it. It's very godlike.

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       Yeah. It's very good. Lord. Eventually just tell me that's the only way to teach kids in that sense. Eventually that confusion that people feel of the existential angst of being a person. We don't know what the fuck you are. Where are you going? What happens when I die? Like almost universally that needs to be plugged up. Whether it's plugged up with this alien story or whether it's plugged up with a, you know, a Mormon story. What happened? You just got to plug it up. Yes. That aching feeling of terror that like some people that's meant that. What are we doing here? What are we doing here though? I understand they, there's a, there's a great, uh, existentialist philosopher slash author Khumbu. You ever heard? Of course horse. I haven't heard of. You haven't? No strangers. One of my favorite books. I love them. Yeah, you'd love him.

Speaker 4:          00:24:42       But here's the thing. You just did it yesterday or was it the day before? I can't remember. That's the first line. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, it's really good. But he liked that thing that you're talking about that at aching fucking thing. His premise c, a m u s his premise in a lot of, uh, of his ilk, their premise is that, that, that is being human, like that awful feeling of like having a whole that you are constantly trying to. That's the name of his book. The Myth of sisyphus. The stranger illustrated is a novel. Let's try the myth of sisyphus. If you want to get into the philosophy Anglo, but uh, it's pretty, it's pretty cool stuff, but it will give you that chilling kind. Sufis s y s is there another wine there? Assistant s y s y p e h u s fuss as if it's beautiful. I don't really need to totally know that.

Speaker 4:          00:25:39       Google next to be on the kindle crack crack. This specificity was cursed. It's a Greek myth, was cursed by the gods to eternally push a boulder up to the very top of a hill and then to let it roll back down the hill. And when it gets to the top of that story, is that like the Colonel Turner? So the, so like the excess, some existentialists look at the human predicament and they point out the fact that you're going to die. No one will remember you in a few hundred years. All, most human achievements that have happened in the past are completely lost, gone, forgotten. Even though they're in history, it's still ultimately a meaningless thing in a sense that you have this inevitable personal extinction that's going to happen. Uh, and so the predicament and life is one of being sisyphus. Here we are. Anything we do, push it up the fucking hell.

Speaker 4:          00:26:33       It's gonna like roll back down. We got to start over, push it up the hill, roll back down. This is the kind of human archetype for how do we, in the midst of what appears to be meaninglessness and the infinite scale, find meaning in an in like human endeavors. When the whole thing's going to get wiped out by the star, the sun. Some of those philosophies have brought them to God. What's that? Some of those existentialist that brought them to God because there were like, this must be the answer. The access. There are weirdly, there are theological or theistic existentialists, Soren Kierkegaard. There's some of them are, and you believe in God. We're start. Yeah. Then they're the ones who are just like, no, it's just all nausea and confusion. My friends, it's just a lot. I don't buy that because I don't buy them knowing.

Speaker 4:          00:27:22       I don't know anyone that says no. It's nothing. Nope. There's nothing like, how do you know? There's nothing. You have no idea where. There's no examples. There's no price for something. You're right. Don't even bring it up, right? You don't bring it up, but you don't say no, but you don't. You don't say it's not something either, but are you land more in that camp, don't you? It's not even part of the conversation. Get out of here with that shit. What is what a fish were once there? Well, if you look at the fossil record, is there any reason to think that otherwise, what are you talking about? I think there is. I think there's reason to think that Fisher bears or whatever the fuck you want to think if it gets you in the zone because there's like a. that's like taking two dribbles worth a shot.

Speaker 4:          00:28:07       Like it's just like ritual, ritual. It makes you feel better. That's fun thing you just described. The two dribbles before the foul shot that the that's called chaos magic. That's the roots of a magical system that just that it's based on the idea that these symbols themselves, they lack any inherent meaning outside of the mind state that they place you in and so if they help you transform your will into reality, so if that ritual helps you score, if whatever the fucking thing is that you do prior to sitting down to write or prior to whatever it is that your job happens to be, if that actually puts your mind in a state where you are more likely to receive inspiration or you're going to be more graceful or athletic and that's all that fucking matters. Who Cares? Yeah. That's all that matters. Who the symbols themselves, do you.

Speaker 4:          00:28:58       I mean, are you really going to like worry over the actual existence of a elephant headed god? That right? It can shrink down and ride around family unit over at Rosewell and it's like, oh, they've fallen out of the issue is a belief system as much as the issue is getting caught up in an ideology that you can't question. That's because when you do that, if you want to go into thor camp or whatever camp you want to go to and you believe is the, you know the grand ruler of the fucking. Yeah, no matter who it is. In the name of God, Odin, Odin, renter, praise, Odin. Praise Odin. Yes. Anytime you can't question anything, you're fucks bill. If you have something you believe

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       that's probably empowering. It's not empowering is when you subscribe to an ideology because if you believe that there's some all eternal loving God that's looking over you and judging you everyday and that you have to do your best to make him proud. That is your divine father. He created you and you know, deepen your DNA. What the good things you're supposed to do is if that if you really go live your life like that, you'll probably live a pretty fucking cool life. Yup. You'll be really nice to people. You'd be super righteous. You would want to make your daddy God all proud of you and shit. The problem is when you subscribe to an ideology, and that doesn't let you question anything, the problem is not believing in a god. The problem is now what do you have to do? Because you believe that God, well, now you have to stop gay marriage. You have to stop masturbating. You have to stop people from doing this and stop. Yeah, you gotta. You have to listen to me because my way is the right way and the Lord is the true Islam is the truth. All of that stuff. It's all the same shit. It's all the same shit. The ideologies, the problem. It's not the believing in God. What does this motherfucker God want you to go? Do you want me to strap dynamite to your chest and walk into a cafe,

Speaker 4:          00:30:49       but God gets associated just like you're talking about the chicken lady. God gets associated with that, so you want to be like, no, fuck them and fuck the thing that they believe in. Exactly. Well, yeah, it's like a guy that. What happens is there's violent people in the world and they like to be violent. They enjoy it. It gets them off, but they can't rationalize the fact that they enjoy being violent because it's seems so monstrous and animalistic need. You need a reason. See, their religion is a fantastic way to justify every dark activity that humans engage with. Yes. You can fucking like. Did you see the thing that popped up on the Internet? Isis is guide to having child sex slaves. Did you see that? Like I have a guidebook which is like they have questions like there's important questions. If you have a slave that's under aged, that's a girl and you're wanting, or a, I guess a guy, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:31:38       I guess they don't like gay people. So if you have an underage sex slave that's a girl and you are an isis, you're going to have some questions. The number one being, when do I get to fuck her? Yeah. And this is a guidebook where they're like, well, can you fucker. Well, if she's able to have sex in this guidebook, it's as if she's able to have sex. Uh, yeah. But if she's not, then you can enjoy her in other ways, like just don't penetrate her. But that's a real thing, man. They put, they're putting that in there

Speaker 2:          00:32:06       quoting, how do we know this is real and how do we CIA plant? We

Speaker 4:          00:32:10       don't know that it could be an. I did think that this could be propaganda. I thought that this could be propaganda, but they do. There are taking slaves like it is a thing that they are taking slaves and some of those slaves are women and if you have a female slave that you've taken, that you've captured from your enemy, then you are going to have some questions about the role. Like as a religious person. Definitely. Absolutely. Yeah. What are you going to do with your. How do you ethically fuck this girl? Like when like when the dishwasher was invented, Jews had to go to the rabbis and said we allowed to put milk and meat dishes in here. What's the ruling here? That shit, that kind of logic. They use that based on, in a second.

Speaker 1:          00:32:47       Are you, uh, what is the answer to that? A lot of Jews have separate dishwashers. Dad, Syria, lariat conflation. Oh my goodness. If you want to be kosher. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:32:56       The main thing is the main thing is this, right? What the. I mean it's awful. It's like the sex slavery isn't as ridiculous as that as the structure is always the same, which is a very manipulative, charismatic power, hungry narcicisstic guy has convinced some dumb people that he has got the line end God and as long as they're coming to him to ask him what to do, it's great. That's the main structure. The structure needs to be that have certain amount of people believe that there is one person who has contact with an invisible guy and that that that person will tell them what's right and what's wrong. It's very comforting. We don't have to worry about it. You don't have to worry about it. Just go to the guy and ask him like you can feed her moral quantitative figure. Yeah, but it's so dark, but really when you see what's what, what's happening, there is this incredibly awful version of snm it sadomasochism you're going to your daddy to find out how the fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:33:55       It's like this dark say to mass. That's what it is. It's snm. You're going to your daddy to find out if you can put milk with whatever in your in your washing machine, you're going to daddy to find out if you can use birth control. It's always set. A lot of times it's sex related. Like the pope just said something like, didn't you just come out and say like you don't have to. He was talking about how to have sex. You know, they'll tell you you can't use birth control. You know that. They tell you things involving sex, like a man who is connected to an invisible being will tell you how to fuck on this planet. What I mean it is stupid. It is as dumb as it gets, but when you consider the fact that it is, not only is it real, but it is like these people doing this are behind businesses that are making billions of dollars every year and that money is going in the direction of paying for lobbyists to control government and politics. That's when it becomes minister government. Sinister.

Speaker 1:          00:34:57       If you look at it from a picture perspective, do you think it's possible for people to have gotten where we've gotten as quickly as we've gotten without religion, without some organizing ethical behavior was the big jump early on now? What's holding us back? We're back then it was really helping us like guys, guys don't kill. Well, we would be raping and pillaging. Still. There's a Judeo Christian way of living they say, which is just like the basic tenants like don't murder, don't steal, don't, don't, don't rape. Well, it's almost like an idea virus that is introduced into a system in order to force growth in a certain direction because I never would have gotten society without a doubt it. I doubt it. Dudes want to fuck the Greeks. People want to rape. Yeah, but they had a gang of different gods, but I think they were kind of like Greek gods.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       I think even back then they were. I think even back then. I don't know for sure. You know what? I'm not even going to that part of me that likes to chime in as though I know anything about Greek gods to come in, have no idea. I have no idea. I don't know. I'm not really sure about that man, but I do think that it's a. The predicament that regardless of that being, whether that was a kind of cast that needed to be placed on humanity as a whole to allow this growth or this thing to do. Now we're in a place where we've outgrown the cast time to take off the cast. It's starting to smell like a. like somebody sneezed into erotic vagina. Well, it's being replaced with a new one. It's being replaced with atheism. Atheism is very much a religion, but we take those tenants of like, yeah, we got killed.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       We lost that one. I don't mean it in a negative way. I mean it's like religion is the wrong word. It's an organized group. The people that are a part of it, they. They subscribed to the ideology of this organized group and or almost like for a large percentage at least, I shouldn't say almost the majority, but a large percentage or liberal, a large percentage of atheists are liberal people. They tend to lean left with their ideas. I would say if you had to gauge the difference between the Republican side and there were Democrats are like, which one has more atheist? It would clearly be Democrat. Right? Is that right? Am I guessing? I'm just guessing. I don't know. Let's see if we're right. I'm sure that's been done. That's. Yeah, that seems pretty logical to think that. You mean it does seem logical, but let's see if it's true.

Speaker 1:          00:37:25       Also the more into their super into God. The Republicans might have some atheists, but the ones that are super undergone, those are more Republicans. I don't really know. Could you be a single president? Is that even country? Nope. The candidates of the president. You can't be like. No, if you haven't figured that out. I hardly think. I was wondering what would happen like if Obama as a president allowed to have another job like in Obama start like working on comedy. Could he do stand up if he wanted to at night? If he wasn't working at better could. That would be amazing. I've done my job. It's 6:30 PM. I worked an extra hour. I'm clocked out president. A lot of the people in Congress are closeted that are atheist closet. That's hilarious. Wow. What a bunch of fucking fakers it's saying there's an article about this on a progress. Why all of the atheists in Congress are are closeted. That's. We'll say it had to pretend like you can't. It's not popular. Atheism is not unpopular. There's a certain thing that people want to do. They want to say something really stupid and have everybody else go you like, we're not going to think anymore than we already. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       When people say, well, I'll tell you what, I meet somebody and they're an atheist walk way because they're a damn fool. Who said a Steve Harvey. That's right. I did it in a white boy damn food and it gets silly. Silly, silly,

Speaker 4:          00:39:02       that's an argument, PJ Harvey or whatever it was, kind of moral compass. Do you operate on them? That's the idea. I can't trust you if you don't believe and assemble. That was created a long time ago by people trying to control other people. This is like silly, so forget it. There's a book I read in God dammit. I wish I could remember the name of it, but the very first chapter in the book was talking about how fascinating it is that in the old testament when God is asking for offerings, yeah, killed only want stuff that humans like. Like he only wants the best thing. Like God never tells priests to ask people for like a jar of wasps. It's only, it's only like goats. Like now the same system worked. Then the priest would come out and be like, God wants. They do money. That's what they do.

Speaker 4:          00:39:55       The fucking people, Jimmy or whatever his name is. Yeah. Yeah, but it's. The difference is money now it's this ambiguous thing, but back then what was kind of interesting is like you would actually ask for like the fatted calf or you'd ask her stuff was only stuff pad. God wants a new ipad. Technology. Yeah. God wants a. don't let your computers. Yeah, it's very. It's fascinating that way. But I still. I mean I do like. I don't know. I don't know. I think God's an overused word, but I do think there is definitely like I don't know what God wants. He didn't really tell us officially. How about, how about we just give him some of this shit. It's our favorite shit. Yeah. Just get on the ice, man. That's really fascinating stuff. I've been reading this book that I know it's a controversial book and some people say that it's like, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:40:40       I liked the book. It's well written. It's called a zealot by Reza as la land. It's the historical Christ and his premise is that Jesus, the regardless of its premise, what's really fascinating is he just talking about what it was like back then, which is that the Romans had, were occupying, um, that, that, that land and that the priests were actually people who were used to be used to be like a religious thing, but they were by their positions from the Romans. So everybody wanted the Romans gone. And so. Oh, right. So like, you know, in the story in the Bible, Jesus is crucified between two thieves. And so Reza Aslan says that if you look at the actual word for thief, it actually translates into bandit and bandit is the word that the Romans used to describe people who are trying to overthrow them. So Jesus, his premises was somebody who was pro violence and wanted to overthrow the Romans.

Speaker 4:          00:41:40       And there were a lot of other people I came to. And so when people were saying they were like the son of God or the Messiah, the Term Messiah actually meant like the King of the Jews. Somebody who is going to like lead the liberate the Jews from the Romans. It's a really great book. In the very first chapter, title, it'd be a cool fucking movie. It would be really cool, but the version of when they talk about the the same, well they weren't. No, I mean a lot of like what he says is like if you read in the, in, in the, in the Bible now they haven't scrubbed all of the violence. Debbie said one thing he said is like something about I will turn you away. I will turn, turn father against son. I will turn like, if you aren't able to leave your family then you'll never be able to follow me.

Speaker 4:          00:42:26       It's like all these things which are crazy to liberty is fucking Romans Outta here, man. That was the idea. These assholes are occupying our country. They've taken over our religion. We're going to fucking overthrow them. And they really couldn't understand why God let the Romans in there in the first place. So that was a real monkey wrench in their ideas were the chosen people. But it's like, no, you're not really that fucking chosen people because they're guys who are guarding your temples now wearing Roman outfits. And mine's got freedom from slavery that we're sorta half slaves again quickly and they couldn't tie. Didn't work, man. It was like the to the paradigm did not fit in with their idea that we're the chosen people. Suddenly there's these fucking Romans occupying everything. And so a lot of the, these messiahs and there are many besides before Jesus, by the way, John the Baptist executed. Why was he executed? He was executed because they looked at him as a threat to the Roman power structure. That was it. All these people getting crucified. And by the way, man, crucifixion was in back then, like they were throwing people on crosses every day. So it was like, it was like a constant attempt to like take down a rebellion. That's it. Silence the rebellion. Yeah. Yeah. I silenced the rebellion. It's really interesting. Great Book.

Speaker 2:          00:43:42       It's really crazy. But those sort of volatile moments in history, crazed insane violent moments of control and then the repercussions of that control, those are like the engines that fuel change and oftentimes fuel innovation and I know we'll look at them as being, yeah, we look at them as being as like horrible moments when they're happening because they are for everyone involved. But like for the future, like the, I think all these chaotic moments where these people struggling to get into a position for power in the fact that nobody could really hold it and it keeps and people have their complaints and the people that are rising up, they have the will of the people because the will of the people is we don't want any as fucking terror anymore. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, let's go get them. And then they get in and they become the person that we're fighting against.

Speaker 2:          00:44:25       Like this process repeats itself over and over again. And it seems like objectively, if you look at it, it's this process of cleansing or filtering, almost like water coming down from a glacier and going through all those rocks until it becomes pure. It's like, it's got to go through all these trials and tribulations. There's got to be all these fucking chaotic moments of horror. So we understand what har is. We never repeat her. You got to have a holocaust, understand where the sixties came from. You've got to have these bad moments that sort of make you like long for and accomplish the great height.

Speaker 4:          00:44:58       This is why I, I just had Alex Gray on my podcast and I'm not going to try to repeat what he said about the Jews, the chosen people because they're creating psychedelics, but he did one of his premises because Hoffman was a Jew. But when will, the idea is that we needed scientific materialism, atheism. We needed people to turn their backs on the ancient version of God so that we can understand the universe at a deep enough level to be able to, uh, create the, to synthesize lsd and all the various smart to figure that shit out. Yeah, it's really cool. But it's kind of what you're saying, which is like we needed like these phases in human evolution are really important because like if, if you, if you're constant, if you're caught up and are ridiculous version of the deity and then maybe you're not going to be so inclined to study molecular biology or maybe you're not gonna be able to study chemistry in the same way and without studying that stuff, then we wouldn't have some of the psychoactive compounds that I think a lot of people consider as being one of the potential ways that our species can evolve.

Speaker 4:          00:46:11       And so these, these, these psychedelics can actually be ways to connect with the thing that the ancient religions were talking about. And then the thing that ended up being like turning turned into like a painted clown, you know, that people will. Somebody had a vision, you know, Moses by that. What was the burning Bush Bush, what was that? What was it made of though? It was called a Acacia or something which has what in it? DMT. Tryptamine. So the premise here is godliness

Speaker 2:          00:46:42       fucking hurt. Well, the idea of what is, what would the story really big? Well, if you're translating something from ancient Hebrew and then you put into the Latin and then eventually the English, what when you're doing that, you're going to. The way they explain things is going to come off very different. Like if you ever read like Russian story's translated to English. There's. It's so bizarre. Yeah. Throw it through Google translate. It's so busy. It's so hard to understand what is their language works so much differently. So by saying that like God took the form of a burning Bush, they easily could be saying he was smoking dmt. That's right. Easily. Yeah, and that's the fucking answer. You dry the fucking that Bush out. Figure out a way to get the fucking dmt out of it. You smoke it. Like if you. And especially if that's how they did. Like what if they just lit

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       those bushes on fire and then just read it all in, some out of it. Just breathe in wholesale smoke. They did it like totally caveman style. Just take those bushes, hack them down, dry them out, make a fucking a tent, like one of those sweat lodges and let it fill up. Hot herself with dmt and then he saw God was like, dude, everybody down there. Hold on. I got. Oh my God, I got some stuff to tell you. Oh my God. Because God was telling you that not to covet your neighbor's wife, not because your neighbor's wife is like his leaves my life while was alone. The idea was that the guy owns that white. Hey. Yeah. That's crazy. Like this insane archaic way of thinking that's connected to that time. Yeah. So we don't even if Moses did say those things, we have no idea what the actual words that came out.

Speaker 1:          00:48:22       If Moses did have this psychedelic, ancient, he was not used anymore. And not only that, like who the fuck wrote it down? It wasn't Moses. Moses didn't write it down. If I told you some shit that happened to me when I was a child and then you were. It was your job to write a book after I died. Oh, you would butcher it. I would put your, your life, you would butcher Milo. We would butcher each other's lives if Moses wasn't writing it himself to Moses. Yeah. You know, if you're not getting his fucking notebook, like who knows what was actually said but jealous. Written the same way throughout history. Like they write every letter the same exact way. That's the written tour world tour or something crazy looking, by the way is a language that's cool. It's beautiful and it's so strange and psychedelic.

Speaker 1:          00:49:07       They have to have a musical notes on each one of the letters. You can really, you know what to go up and say it while you're reading at the Toro road or partial. Can you read Hebrew? Of course. Fucking crazy, man. I'd like to learn it. You lived in Israel, religious studies. Was it fun? Yeah, I can. I'm going to have. It was just like a given for awhile, but now that I look, step back and look at it, I was like, that's pretty fucking cool. Three weeks. I thought it was cool. I lived in Israel for two years. Wow. How old were you? 18. 18 to 20. So it was all that got drunk there for the first time. Pre, post, pre pussy. Wow. I haven't do anything back there. Wow. That's a fast. So slowly take the buses and stuff. What's it like there? Everything's made of stone. Jerusalem. The whole city made up stuff. The old all stone. But everywhere else is like stone outside, you know the buildings. It just looked really pretty. Did you go to that wall, climbed up in that movie, you know, security cameras. Why Monitor to the wall? Separating from a mass of zombies dancing and having a great time and then all of a sudden it's not fine. Yeah. He escaped to easily a lot in that movie. Like plane crash and then only the two of you survive.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       It's like Godzilla. Same sort of situation. But. So you were there from 18 to 20? Eighteen to 20. I really got drunk for the first time. I was like, what years was that? Well first I went. My high school does it half year for senior year. The second semester, second for six months we go to Israel and we all get tour groups. That was the foods. It's really two and a half years. So one year and calendar year was this [inaudible]? Ninety two, I think. January of [inaudible] 92. So this is like Clinton presidency, Bush. I voted absentee ballot for Clinton. That was the only time I ever go to the president.

Speaker 4:          00:51:08       Did you were religious garb while you were there? I mean Yamaka and the tassels man, one thing we love doing because there was no black people there, only Ethiopians and they were like in like a different part of the town.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       I'm of the country, um, who just yelled nigger already each other down the street. Oh no, because it doesn't mean anything. Doesn't mean anything to anybody. That's fascinating. Scariest word. Every. Yes. You'd have to do like a full three 60 sweep of your surroundings with a helicopter parachute down and yell it to feel super confident. Someone was like the only word that you can yell out and the group is allowed to punch you. If you yell at people. Women can't just run up to you and punch you, you know, but if you didn't yell out Nigger, they have a free pass. Just punch. You want people to know this. The only racial slur that that is a free pass to violence. Yeah. Chinese, if you yell out change now look at you like you motherfucker, you piece of shit. But there are certain dudes, not all of them, but there are certain dudes that if they catch you yelling out that word, they will fuck on Prophet Mohammed of words.

Speaker 1:          00:52:37       What? It's crazy. If you're in a place, I mean there's guaranteed. There's people that just heard you say that, that are going to be offended. They're like, you know, fuck that guy. You know who? Fuck he think he is yelling at shit out. Dropping bombs podcast 22 years ago. No, it doesn't even matter. Just the fact that you had just said it now, right? Just the fact that making fun, that how irresponsible. What's to say that you remember like the bit about the three magic words and that was one of them that like, you can't even say it, like you're not even allowed to say the word reference to if your weight. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:53:09       It is a really interesting thing because symbols are harmless, but it somehow they justified violence. Like whenever this ridiculous thing and image of the prophet, the word round, whenever it's there, it's like that thing itself is meaningless. Harmless.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       But it allows, it allows violent people an excuse to be violent and there is nothing I think more satisfying than some people, uh, to, to, to be violent and righteous at the same time. Like American sniper that guys like pegging like, oh, it's just some propaganda over from kills. Not One role. Even though every time it was like, I don't know what that is, is because man, fuck it. I'll tell you the shot. Never got it wrong. Oh, awesome. Oh Rah Rah movie. Yeah, it was, it was really exciting. Was horrible. And you seen it? No. Howard stern was raving about it this fuck you old man was a horrible job. There was no plot, it was just some scenes. The wife was only annoyed. I haven't seen entire time. She was just like, are you going out there? And again, he'll give. Never built a relationship.

Speaker 3:          00:54:24       There's no fucking move. You haven't written this fucking movie. Don't give a fuck at the very edge they go, they go that he, okay. So he comes home, he's all fucked in the head. He meets some, uh, some, some, his wife, he meets some veterans. It helps them fucking sniper and that's how he gets his life together, helps them sleep and shit. And then he picks one guy up and he's like, yeah, we're going to go snipe today. And then, uh, just at home on the range and the guy looks at his wife weird and then it cuts away. It goes, uh, he was killed by a veteran. Oh, is that guy? But they didn't even show what happened. They didn't even show up to our 20 minute movie show every tour fucking forward toward combine them, but they won't show. Forget that they failed to mentioned that your son or your daughter and they showed footage of the funeral procession. Also. The guys like Jesse Ventura sued that guy and one the guy who lied. Yeah, that's how ridiculous it was. There was no. It wasn't just dad.

Speaker 2:          00:55:18       Apparently a whole long laundry list of questions.

Speaker 3:          00:55:22       That was that guy. No wonder Carbon Jasper. They probably didn't take out the plot like A.

Speaker 2:          00:55:28       Well, there was a bunch of other things that he did that he said he did. Like one of them was, there was a car jacking or two people shot and killed it. Read like a fucking men talking about himself. Apparently that's how I saw no evidence of the car jacking. Took that guy to guy and there was another one where he killed a bunch of people in Katrina. He was a sniper and Katrina would shoot shooting looters and talked about, which is like, okay, like it's one thing if you're shooting terrorists who have rocket launchers, but you're shooting people that are poor people that are stealing shit because they're involved in chaos because the fucking water has come and surrounded the city and there's no resources and so you're shooting looters like it should be really fucking careful about who we celebrate. If you're shooting looters, yeah, you're a murderer. Yeah. We're not talking about war. We're not talking like even Michael Moore was talking about his pollutant though. That's not what you get for Luda. You

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       don't get that from God. Damn. It's not made for people who want an agnostic for a judge to say, well, it's not only that, it's not the fucking roof. It's going to be delivered because you go to a trial and you have a jury of your peers. That's what. That's what the government is supposed to be established for, like to be on a rooftop. Then you're just murdering. This movie was like a full liar. Crazy. Well, Jesse Ventura fucking navy seal. He was in. What's called the Udt before it was the navy seals, I believe that's the name of the organization. There was a predating name. The same. Jesse Ventura was one of them. Yeah. So apparently this guy told the story about knocking out Jesse Ventura and Jesse Ventura badmouthing the troops and bad mouth no more, which he said he would never do, never did, never argued with this guy that he never got hit.

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       And he gave the guy an opportunity to, uh, to tracked it. Otherwise he was [inaudible] he wrote about in his book he called them scruffy face or something like that. But then on radio shows he admitted that it was Jesse Ventura, so can do the math. I think he did it on Opie and Anthony. Actually, I think that's where it came out. So they realize that it's not true. So the guy got killed. Okay. Chris Kyle gets killed and now Jesse Ventura goes through with the lawsuit with the guy's wife, which that's. See? No, she's got all the profits from the. Yes, fuck her off the fucking lie about him her. Then she started saying, I give that money to charity and then it comes out later. She's a liar too. She kept 20 percent of it. I think as long as her look, if her why should life isn't.

Speaker 1:          00:58:00       I mean it's, he's suing the guy who lied. It just so happened to the guy who lied, died, let's stop selling the book, but that's the issue because you're dead, right? You're dead. I'm going to the issue on the book. Random guys like who owns the book? Who put but. But then the issue is does he represent them when he goes on radio stations and says something that's not even in the book. Does he name the guy in the story in the book, but does that make them responsible? I say it doesn't say it's not random house because he said scruffy face with a. But then when he says, now I've told you it was graffiti faces. Now what you've printed label or whatever is the thing man, if he wrote about all that other shit about shooting looters and all that other shit. Like if that turns out to be not true, which people are saying it's not true, you really got to take the whole book.

Speaker 1:          00:58:43       Took the book off like this is what's important to separate had that book, but the shattered a little pieces or whatever. A thousand little pieces. Yeah. Yes. He was like, no, it was all a lie and she was like, what? Because again, I'm a fucking kid. He just said he went to heaven and he's. He came out and said the whole thing was a lie. You know that? Yeah. They pulled that book too. They went to heaven. Well, no, there's this cheesy buck where a kid goes into a coma, flies around having for awhile, comes back right to this best seller. People are like, I knew everyone was real and I knew it was like this. I never read it, but it's funny. It's just the La area, but the kid got religion actually got religion was and felt

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       so guilty about wanting that. He came out and said the whole thing was alive, that I could get attention. It's not real great.

Speaker 2:          00:59:27       It's really, it's the Nicole that there's a great, there's a great blog that I read called a if you just google truth justice and the curious case of Chris Kyle. It's really, really well written. I wrote which explains all of the various stories and here's why they couldn't be true and here he's not casting a judgment, not using the inflammatory language. Just trying to explain like what may be or may not have been true said in the beginning of this movie that was just released. This is all a true story. Some of it I'm sure was. That's the thing, the guy that the shoot some kid and they go like, if you're wrong about this, you'll find that your spotter spotter is telling you you're going to go to jail forever if you take this wrong shot. Another thing you have to remember too is Clint Eastwood, Clint Eastwood, who used to be the baddest motherfucker and I'm done now. He's an old dude. Talk to the chair. Yeah. You are dressed. Obama.

Speaker 4:          01:00:24       Yeah. How do you direct a movie? When I saw the thing? No, seriously, when I saw the thing. Oh, I thought was, oh, this is just clearly wartime propaganda tweeted that he considered, he compared it to the sniper movie and I Tarantino's movie, I think Rogan backpedaled a little bit, but in Tarantino's movie inglorious bastards there watching this in Germany, they're watching a movie about a sniper and it's being celebrated propaganda. It's propaganda. American sniper is propaganda. There's no question about it, so we know that. Then I was thinking like, oh, let's make this shot of Clint Eastwood really direct this because when you see him at the Republican National Convention, he seemed kind of like out of it, so then I was thinking, how the fuck is this guy directing like this kind of hardcore action forum and the vase there because he's this manly, rugged, right wing Republican hero, and they knew that that would like get more people to watch this movie, which is essentially a lubricated water slide that leads to your nearest recruiting office. If you get hypnotized by the thing enough, that's what it is. Oh, you want to fight it? You want to fight for justice and I'll tell you this now. No,

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       you want to be noble. You know what, you don't want to work in the oil fields. You want to be noble straight to seal. It was 30. Think about a lot of people that are in this country that are. You got boring as shit town with no fucking opportunity and you're surrounded by a bunch of dummies and then you go see this movie and you're like, Holy Shit. But I think when you make a movie about someone's life story, and this is what I was pissed off at Fox catcher for the same reason, that movie foxcatcher about a John Dupont who was that crazy old man who shot a Dave Schultz who's an Olympic champion wrestler and it was based on his brother Mark Schultz in this one. They fucked with everything in that movie. They. He's so angry. He's been Mark Schultz have been tweeting like crazy because he's still alive.

Speaker 2:          01:02:15       He's an Olympic gold medalist. I mean that. It killed him in the movie. Well, no, no, no, no. John Dupont killed the, an Olympic gold medalist in the movie, but his brother, Mark Schultz, who the book the movie and the book is based on is still alive and they changed all these aspects of his life for this movie and he's like, I'm still alive, but this is me. Like this isn't like a Chris Kyle thing where they made the movie after he's dead and who knows what, you know, he let put in and not put. This is like mark was saying, this didn't happen. Like they messed with shit that didn't even make sense. Like they had the UFC in their movie, but it was in 1988. There was no fucking UFC until 1993. I didn't even exist. So they're watching an actual fight between big daddy goodrich who was the eventual opponent of Mark Schultz and a lot of people like, you're real good.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       You're all read true view. Nobody gives a shit. It's a both. The story. No, it's not dummy. It's about history because why would you make up any aspects of history when you're doing a true story and you don't need to change the timeline for the UFC. That's totally arbitrary. Like someone deciding to do that is their own creative flair. Just kissing, just comping their balls and jizzing over history. If you did that with that. How the fuck am I going to believe any of the aspects of the story because you lied about something. I know you lied about. This is weird shit where there's like there's like this weird relationship between the two and they're looking at each other weird and he's wearing shorts and now he's got frosted tips and people were saying that it seemed like it was gay and shoulds got really upset that they were insinuating there was some sort of a gay relationship.

Speaker 2:          01:03:46       They like fucked with the timeline of his achievements too because he had already won the world championships. I mean he was already the best wrestler in the world, in his weight class and they were making it look like, like he needed his brother and he was. He was sucking in, dupont was, his career was falling apart. He was the best wrestler in his weight class, in the word mark. Fucking show was an animal. If you watch him wrestle when he was at his peak form, he was a fucking animal and like the changed like the aspects of his achievements in this movie, like he was already a world champion, like the way they made it and the way they. It's like the guy was fucked and nothing was going right for him and then he needed this John Dupont situation and that's why he moved in, in a beautiful mind when, when, when the wife stuck with them, even though it was going crazy. Yeah. The real life. She just left. Of course, soon as you run the bath water in the kitchen, I was like, I'm out. I'm divorcing you. It's over. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:04:39       It was like, we're going to make it together. Baby is American snipers that were going to tell the whole story like what whole story. There was also a shitty father and husband. I thinking about the Ari Shaffir story. When it comes out, they're going to. They're going to show him like with a bag of mushrooms, but he's like weeping as he eats. I'm like, I can't stop calling him. Like Arya. Got To stop eating those mushrooms. No one is watching child porn. Fuck you. I don't even know why. Why should it be legal? I didn't fuck any kids. Why isn't the video themselves legal and put some words in your mouth. Someone could could totally see.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       Put it like on a newspaper quote or something. I have it come up. Did you ever see lenny with Dustin Hoffman? You know, I missed it. I can see. Look, I'm a huge fucking Lenny Bruce Fan, so I'm fascinated by. I'm not a huge fan of is this is a tricky way to say it because like I think if I'm not endorsing what right now, I'm saying like if you go like have lenny bruce is performing at the laugh factory. Knew what the comedy store. I would tell people to go see you. I would go because it wouldn't be freaky just to see him, but you're dealing with a completely different era. The world was just way different. But anyway. This is great. Dustin Hoffman movie, where Dustin Hoffman fucking nailed it. He sounds just like lenny bruce. I mean one of the few times where a guy's on stage and it seems like he's a real comic.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       Huh? It really, it's really good. But he says a bunch of Shit and you go, did he say that? How do I know? He said that guy. No, you know, I know you don't know exactly what came out of his mouth at any given moment. So a lot of this is just bullshit. You know? So like if you, there's a real person, you got to try your best to make everything as on the money as possible. Whatever you fill in has got to be directly related to everything that you absolutely know happen, but you're not going to have to fill in stuff. Like when he tells his wife he loves her for the first time, it's like, that's your, like I'm guessing this heart one. It's fine. Unless the wife's alive and she can tell you that could help. But I think what you're talking about is a controversial subject.

Speaker 1:          01:06:44       I think some people say that you got creative license when things, and you can say, based on a true story, it's. This is a true story would look he's Ra Ra all the way. He's a flag waving old man. He really is. All those old men stick together. We'll look. I think this is. I mean, does it look. I think Howard Stern, just saying he enjoyed it as a movie. It's supposed to be a very good movie. It was like well made as a movie. There was no story. The acting was horrible. There were some cool shit like fucking sleeping shots. This thing was cool and that was it, but it wasn't much labeled. He's not like a war, like the one victim of bad guy wants to get the whole time. It's like I don't understand. It's down to you, man. I think I've sat on the podcast called Atlanta.

Speaker 1:          01:07:33       Here's what it boils down to. You want to use military equipment, right? And a movie. You're not going to get your own fucking tanks and where are you going to get the military equipment from? You're going to get the military equipment from the military and the military and you can load that's over on this. They get to have script approval, so the military, they look through your script and they make sure that the staff that is in your script is going to get people down to their local recruiting office and that's why they let you use their machinery. Don't use it to send them to cooper that there's never been an antiwar movie that hasn't made an enlistment go up. Antiwar movie. Yeah. You feel like you literally cannot make an antiwar movie because every single depiction of war makes people go, oh, that's cool. Like platoon,

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       all of it, all of it. You can see the trend right afterwards. Enlistments shoots up after those big movies tell you see the same front of Ryan. The guy gets blown up the close night, but everyone's like, I want to be a sniper. You forget the fact they got blown up. His people like being violent and this is why Sebastian younger's book war is such an incredible book because it. It portrays war with no attempt to be like, this is right or this is wrong. It just says if you take it. I can't remember the exact wording, but it's like if you take a 22 year old and put them behind one of those giant fucking southern. Yeah, it feels good. It's fun to like. It feels like that's Bob. He pulled love violence. So if you can figure out a way to get people to be violent without the guilt that goes along with like you're killing other members of your species than what do you do.

Speaker 4:          01:09:06       You create an imaginary story. Right, and the imaginary story in Iraq was the weapons of mass destruction. Also, Saddam Hussein, what they said this movie like, Oh, if I don't do my job to come to San Diego and then knock on your door. Apparently another aspect of the book that has been the question is that the, the barrels of weapons of mass destruction that they found, like he said that they found like chemical weapons. Right? Really? Oh. He said we actually saw them laid eyes on them, but they're like, well then why don't you tell anybody what, what do you mean? Where's the enrichment? Google search, do a google search on birth defects in some of the parts of Iraq that we attack because we used a shells that had some kind of radioactive isotope in it and now the babies are being born with birth defects because the other thing people say is Saddam Hussein gas his own people, right?

Speaker 4:          01:09:56       He gets his own people. Well, what are we doing to them? And we're dropping all these bombs. Targeted strikes, man. They know exactly where they're heading. No, they don't. People, babies are being born with severe birth defects because of what we did there. So I think in a movie like that, you need to at least illustrate the fact that the reason that man was sitting on the tops of buildings in that area, killing them people was, he was, was because he was sent there based on bad information to say the least. And uh, the people he's killing, like in the very beginning, it's like anybody over the age of 18, this is anybody over the age of 18 in this area. This is an evacuation zone. So there's no one except people that are out to kill us. It's all open game. It's like, oh wait a minute.

Speaker 4:          01:10:44       So you're saying that because the first shot, so don't worry about this question, but morally know anyone who was there over 18, that's what they're there for. Monsters did not leave the city that we bombed, that they lived in when we told them to. So if they're still here, kill and then still like shows restraint. And then when he found the house, it was a kid, but he has a fucking grenade launcher. He waits until the kids running at the fuck is about to throw it. And then he shoots him. But it's totally just shooting kid.

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       And then the mom, what the fuck

Speaker 4:          01:11:15       and wait. But why would they be angry? I mean really? Why would you be angry? They only destroyed your city that you lived in. This is another thing of why we shouldn't marines. Why the Marines right there where they can get shot, remember thousands of miles away back to America.

Speaker 2:          01:11:32       Well we were saying earlier about ideologies are the problem and being a nationalistic person, subscribing and being a patriot, subscribing to one nation only regardless of what the actual act itself is. Looking at it like this. Okay. Because it's one of the books like that is an ideology. There you go. That is as much of an ideology as a religion. It's an unquestioning thing. Like, you know, one of the things that Michael Moore was saying was that he put it on his twitter, his twitter that a sniper as a coward and everybody got really pissed off. You know, like the, I think the logic behind is kind of silly. Like you have to look them in the eye when you shoot him. Like shooting someone in the back is a coward. Like well in that sense 90 percent of war is cowardly because you're, you're saying some kind of wars.

Speaker 2:          01:12:17       Okay. But some kind of what you have rules. Yeah. Yeah. Look at somebody with or the back or like what about a from 100 yards? How about rock, but that means no more rockets. That means a lot of them want to do is you're shooting people like you don't necessarily look them in the eye when you shoot them. Are you having a dual? Like what are you doing? Standing back to back and walking 10 paces like assholes, like what kind of is the reason to be there? Can you look at some of the negative effects that we want to pull those back? Like what if 30 percent of children the Yemen have ptsd now because of drones?

Speaker 4:          01:12:46       I can't say that's a negative. It's really important that that information gets out there when you are putting a movie out that's going to get people in the same way. Like when Beverly Hills Chihuahua came out, everybody bought a Chihuahua and the pounds filled up with your hours because they also have a sniper. Is gonna do the exact same thing for people who are a little confused on what to do in their lives and they're going to think, well, I guess the best thing I can do right now is kill people that my government tells me are evil. Even though if I study the facts, I find that it's a far more complex issue than that and maybe my decision should not be to become a hired killer for people who are telling me that actually killed people who more than likely are innocent or just trying to defend their home from an invading occupying force.

Speaker 4:          01:13:37       It's really important to realize that. Now. I'm not saying all war is bad because some people will be like, you naive son of a bitch. You don't even realize. Let me repeat the speech. At the beginning of American sniper, this is what the day the speech, so test. Here's the speech the dad gives at the dinner table after the American sniper. What's his name? Chris. What was his name? Chris. Because Chris Kyle is just defended his brother from a beating by a bully and they're sitting around the table. His brothers got bruised up a little bit. Chris Kyle's sitting there and his dad gives this. There's three

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       types of people. Hold on before you get the speech. He goes, I was just defending my brother and he looks at the little brother with a black guy and he goes, is that true? Like, what do you mean? Obviously he has a black guy. He just got beat up. That's right. That's right. What a shitty movie. Is that true? He goes, Yep. It is three tax people in the world. Three types. There's sheeps. Needs are the people who believe that there aren't evil people in the world, and by the way, I'm paraphrasing your own. These are the people who believe that there aren't even people in the world and that everything is safe, and then there's the wolfs and these are the people who try to use eval to overpower others, something like that. And then there's the sheep dogs and these are the people who defend the sheep.

Speaker 3:          01:14:59       Oh God, what are you going to be? It goes, if you're anything, if you're the sheep or the wolf, and he took his belt off and puts down, will be fucked us up. Your us. Watch it, man. It is from the very beginning. It's pure. It really is like the way were talking about how, how, uh, soldiers are on their dying breath will tell him. I'm just glad I got to tell that story. Telling that story. Story, story. He told me. I remember going around telling people like y'all. I met his, his, uh, his fucking buddies and arms when he was dying. He was like, you know, I got married and at least I got it. All right. I would imagine if that really did happen though, that's, that's Saturday than him lying.

Speaker 3:          01:16:05       Assuming it didn't happen, but people are definitely dumb enough to do that you don't understand about the punisher tour of was magical. Oh my God. Wow. That's fucking hilarious. Last words, you know, like I'll be like, but what about, what about him stealing jokes? His last words, but he did it better. Better, better, different in my country, man. Already I will give you $100,000 if on your death bed you say the least, I got $200,000. It would really give him 100,000 dollars. And how would he use it? He's dead. Oh No, you won't need this and I am one of your best friends. So aspiration. At least. Like I said, I got that back by the way, by storytelling show. This is not happy. Premieres this Thursday with Bobby Meibomian Keegan key and

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       Dunkin. We've done these extra stories that we're doing for the web only they'll be on youtube and Dunkin's premiering tomorrow. That's all right. That's all I can tell. A cool story about going to LSD trip. Grateful dead concert. Is there a reason they didn't want to put that on television? The to book another white male was nearly impossible and too many white males. Did you need diversity training? Yeah. There was like, who else can we get? That's a little knock that out of your way to look for non white males. Yeah, so it's a Jerry Seinfeld type situation. Yeah. They're like, look, we'll just going to get to attack. If you don't get some others to attack, it's just like bottom line. It was just fucking pissed about that. What is it? The Oscars, they don't have to get half, but they just got. You got to be representative.

Speaker 1:          01:17:54       That's so crazy about the Oscars. It's all like all white people. Black people are being excluded and less Asian people are being excluded. Joey does. Yeah. Those are both fucking ethnos, but you can't have affirmative action comedy. Your account, you're going to ruin the whole thing. You can't do that. You can't like you will. Whoever's funny you got to say, yeah, yeah, yeah, but you get what you can do it like this. Like show me the pool of people that are qualified and you show them 100 people, like two of those. There's only six blacks that are qualified of those hundreds, but pick two of them. I don't mind being on the Internet. I love the Internet. Yeah. That's where I live is on the flip side. It can be way longer to just like we did last year, completely, like don't worry about any. The one that you put that we did that was on the Internet.

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       It was great. It was fun. It was just actually before the show was even on TV. It's totally awesome to have something on the Internet. I was just confused as to the reasoning for it because it came later to Eric, the guy who runs it with me, he was like, Hey, let's do it. Also a web series, the web series and that way goes to. It's like if we show some short ones, we want to bump somebody up. We can. If they're a good short story Rothbart and with Ms Dot Pat. You know what though? It's fucking awesome about the web too. It doesn't get canceled. Doesn't get canceled. It's on anytime you want. It's actually a way better medium for distribution. Like a youtube channels. Way Better. Especially now you have youtube on apple tv so you can go right to youtube. Yeah, I mean you can get youtube on a lot of those little netflix.

Speaker 1:          01:19:22       You can watch tv, you can watch them on your phone. You can watch anywhere you want it. If it's on comedy central, you're going to be guaranteed a very large audience, you know, like million plus audience of people sitting there watching a lot of them that aren't even your fans. When you get good online, you're going to get all of your fans so they watch it more intently. See your name right there. It's way easier for them. Like to fan wise, we want to do it on TV. Like okay, that's a no weapons. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Also all those stories go on the web. Let's make a cool looking clip story about trying to buy acid in a parking lot on tv. Exactly. Like black, white one that's great. About some sex and a dog is involved and they're like, you're not doing beastiality on here. Put It on the web though. Like five golden. I don't care. As long as that area. I just think the way, like if

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       I get to choose. Yeah, doc had said that because I don't even want to say like I'd rather be the wet. You can say whatever the fuck you want. Yeah, I would. Yeah, for sure. Because they, cause he called me and he's like, can we go through what your story is? The idea being if we can, like maybe we can make it so it could possibly be on TV. And I said, oh no, I just rather not be on TV because I don't want to deal. I don't want to worry about that. I don't want to think about that because the story I'm telling is a story about being in high school, trying to buy drugs and uh, in just the worst slash best acid trip I ever had in my life. You don't even have to worry about someone going, can you make it sound a little less pro the we won't get into it because I am pro lsd and the moment they actually say that maybe could happen, you know, like my special Ed.

Speaker 4:          01:20:54       Go do more drugs. I do drugs. What drugs? Most rooms. Other sort of like a bill look like you'll never. There's nothing ever bad happened to you. Bush gets in office. That could be an issue. Well, yeah, I mean there's a statute. I mean, you could it. Could it be an issue? Is that really loud cry all both. You stop it. You're going to get ideas in their heads. For sure. She's talking about a schedule one drugs. Oh, comedy central's heads that what you're saying. You're not worried about the politicians. Oh No, don't be pussies. You guys are rebels. I think with mushrooms especially, I think mushrooms like, okay, remember when marijuana was deeply illegal, way back in the day, you'd fantasize with your friends about the idea of marijuana becoming legalized and you can see that it could be on the horizon maybe, but it was still kind of like, it's never going to be legal.

Speaker 4:          01:21:45       It's a ridiculous dream. I think mushrooms is the new marijuana. Mushrooms is gonna. Silicide. Ben is going to become a prescription medication that's given to people to stop smoking. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. That's going to happen. They'll wilson once, once they start realizing that there are medical benefits that they're looking like they're proving that. It's like they'll try to separate them again. Thank God for Doblin, right? Oh yeah. He's at. He's a champion hero. That guy is a, that guy deserves to be a, deserves a Nobel prize for the work he's doing for a second because he's doing stringent hardcore studies proving that many of these psychoactive compounds have medicinals up. Rick Doblin from the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic studies maps. It's just they do these like real stuff. They will hardcore studies where it's undeniable, oh look, what do you know silicide been helps longterm smokers quit and when you compare it to Chantix, it's like the silicide minutes a million times better because it'll help with my depression. Yeah, it does. It heals. You, changes the way your brain is functioning you the path that you're on. I think the past year on like someone tried to explain this to me once a voice try to remember the exact way it's explained, but that we want to think

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       of our moments as being moments individual unto themselves, but they're not. They're a chain of unique moments throughout your entire life. Your interpretations of those unique moments. I'm paraphrasing the shit out of this guy, said it, and then all of your associations with life itself that are connected to your interpretations of these moments and then boom, here you are today and you want to think that this is life, but it's only life because of all these pathways that you've carved in the way you view the world. As soon as you change those pathways, you open up a whole new world because now your associations are different, so now your brain's reaction to life changing your route to work and almost saying like, oh, look at these stores for your

Speaker 4:          01:23:53       in chemistry, and it's such a great feeling when ever any if that happens just slightly because a lot of people are in a cave in situation when it comes to their lives. They're literally buried under a series of antiquated, stale symbols that they're looking at the universe through and they feel trapped. It's like their shoes are too tight and if like a psychedelic or meditating too, and I really mean that. I'm not just saying that to because of that, because I'm. I really think meditation has a very similar effect, but any of these things, they reset those symbols, structures in your brain and if you just like if you're in a cave in and you get an extra inch compared to like being compressed against the wall, that's a big fucking deal man. So it's slightly percentage difference. Change change is like, oh thank God I'm 13 percent less frightened than I was for my entire life.

Speaker 2:          01:24:48       Have you ever heard Tony Robbins talk about changing paths in life is a really interesting analogy. He talks about like you're going to cars going the exactly saying or a boat or two boats going exactly the same direction, but one boat just takes a two degree turn, just two degrees here. As they go further down the one boat that took two degree turn is going to go wider and wider away from the original path and that each decision that you make, that's a good decision. Takes you closer. Like even though it's just like you're just steering your ship, just dirt as you go out. It's going to be a much different path, much different end than if you just stayed on the original path. That's incredible. The different and psychedelics makes you go right. Turn Clyde, looking at the. The, the, the currents. Try to bring you back though.

Speaker 2:          01:25:38       Yes. Well Ego tries to keep the current kind of bring it back to where you were gone so it's got to take them a good. Well, I've always said get off that current doing psychedelics. It's like pressing the reset button for your brain, like control all the, your, your desktop reboots and there's only one folder on the desktop that desktop says the folder says my old bullshit and you have two choices. Either you just like create a completely different desktop. Look at reality, a completely different or open up my old bullshit and fall back into these familiar patterns because they're very comforting, right? You know in those moments after the psychedelic experience are so important to grab and hang onto because it gives you this opportunity to make this new way of thinking like a part of your habit. Once you get into that habit, whether it's fucking, you know, the 30 days or 60 days or 90 days, like people say that once you like have a pattern ingrained in how you behave and think and do it just takes a consistent approach to that pattern and then it becomes like an like a part of you like that's why people quit smoking.

Speaker 2:          01:26:40       Like get past 90 days and you'll be all right.

Speaker 4:          01:26:43       Right. Jews say when you have, if you go sit in the same feed three times, he's just keep sitting there. That's your, that's your do all time. Suit. That's smart. Makes Sense. When you take a psychedelic, it's like if your life is a polluted city, like what are those polluted like what's Detroit? Detroit, right? And it's like the psychedelic all of a sudden takes you in a helicopter outside the pollution and so now you're seeing, Oh God, the air up here so fresh. It's so nice. But the thing is helicopters going to land, it's going to put you back out into your city and that's where the job starts, which is like, shit man. I don't remember if the city was wearing like how can I clean this fucking thing up and then that's, that's like the, that's when you start doing things like exercising, meditating, or that's where you like create just a very simple intention in everything you do, which is as much as possible.

Speaker 4:          01:27:31       I'm going to try to alleviate the suffering of people around me as much as I can, you know, not. That might not be a lot. It might just be call. It might just be those two. We got back from, from this last UFC just a little bit of mushrooms was enough. I saw a homeless guy and he was looking for. I was like, I open my wallet and I only have twenties, and I was like, no, fuck it. There you go. That's what it does. And those little moments, man, it shows you that you get those moments present themselves to you all day, fucking long, but if you are stuck in selfishness, you don't see it. Yeah. It's real simple little things, but it's fun. It's a very wonderful. That kind of simple intention can really deep pollute your, your subjective city that you've been sucking in shitty gas.

Speaker 4:          01:28:16       There was one time I saw that I was the only time I was looking for a guide to somebody, but it was Willie Hunter was on him and he was shitting on following. He was shitting on some like comic who would become like a vine star, you know, she was a shitty comment, but it became like a and he was like, I hate falling. We're like, just for fun. There's six second videos. I was like, no, I hate him. Like, what about a six second youtube video? Watch that. I don't, whatever. He was just big, shitty or like try to talk about it. He wouldn't stop that. We started with the mushrooms. He was like, I'm a bad person. I never was like, no, no, you're fine. And he kept doing it and eventually I was like, really? Listen, you're right. That was you. Being a bad person was like, I'm so sorry.

Speaker 4:          01:28:52       There was like, it's okay because here's the deal from now on, you don't have to be that anymore. You can just let that go and let people talk, and he's like, yeah, yeah, that's what it shows you like you can change, but that thing you're talking about where you realize, shit, I'm a bad person. That is there is, I can't remember. Name and Buddhism. There's an actual name for that and it's considered to be a very sweet moment where you need that moment. It's virtualizer where you need that moment where you look at your life and you feel this very specific kind of sadness because you look at all the times you could have been kinder all the times. You could have called that person back all the time. You could have made decisions that were pushing your boat in the direction of a better world and you didn't do it and you should feel sad about that, but you shouldn't spend your whole life feeling sad about it. Right? You should just spend some time there and look at it and think, okay, well that's gone. The past has been devoured by time. There's only this moment now and so from this point forward, as much as I can, my decisions are going to be based on reducing the suffering of my species and that means your trash before doesn't mean you have to let her keep going forever.

Speaker 2:          01:30:04       Yeah, yeah, yeah. The, the path of, of trying to figure out like what's the best way in life is obscured by law and going amazing. Like there's laws that they've created that make the best tools to find out who you really are illegal. That's like there's not a therapy in the fucking world that will get a crazy sociopathic ego, maniacal person to really look at themselves like a bag of mushrooms. Well, there's nothing, nothing. All those moments in film with like, Oh, I realize now that's all bullshit. Creating a mushroom trip. People that you know that are untrustworthy, that you can't. You can't. Like, you can't trust their stories. You can't trust. They're like, those are the people that we all agree could have like the best experience on psychedelics because it'll give them like the best view of themselves, but those are the same type of people that are going to argue against it.

Speaker 2:          01:31:01       Like if you ever talked to people that don't want mushrooms to be legal or don't want like, oh, but fuck that. You think that should be. You'll lose your fucking mind. What about people who have lost her fucking model now? It's like what? People have lost their mind. What are you talking about? Those 14? There's been some people that have blown their brains out with LSD for sure. There's definitely been some people that had some psychotic episodes and it can be argued that a lot of those are psychotic episodes are people who are control freaks, are egomaniacs that are struggling with the reality that's presented with them. Present it to them that you shouldn't try it. That's for sure. People with a history of schizophrenia, the family, bipolar, bipolar people, they probably shouldn't try it either. I mean, there's probably a whole slew of people who have abnormal human chemistry.

Speaker 4:          01:31:45       You know what else? Bipolar, people shouldn't try. Caffeine really shouldn't take caffeine pills. Yeah, you shouldn't do anything that's going to push you into a manic state. It's like we can't consider, you know, it's like, uh, the, the, the victim thing about the victims of psychedelics,

Speaker 1:          01:32:01       you know, and I know you think climbing up, what is it? That math? Yeah, I think it's ridiculous, but there is a valley there called the. I just read about this on Reddit, I think it's called. There's an area, I think it's called the valley of rainbows and they call it that because of the brightly colored jackets on the corpses that are all laying there dead. And I think psychedelics have the same kind of valley. I think that there is an undeniable valley that must be filled with people who have been pushed into psychotic episodes or who are under the influence of a psychedelic made bad decisions, car accidents, all the things that come from irresponsibly using toxic. You've got to admit that's real, but just because that is real doesn't therefore exclude all the people who are saying again and again and again and again.

Speaker 1:          01:32:53       Relationships are better, so the marriages, he even with alcohol or if there's some trump terms don't trump drawing, but it's pretty fun to get fucked up with your friends once in a while you got to look at the whole picture, look at the whole thing. Don't deny the fact that they're dangerous chemicals and that people have more than likely completely lost their shit because of them. Don't deny that, but then also don't deny the benefits and the same way with American sniper, much better movie if that character was actually dealing with the fact that he's blowing people away in a war that has been shown to be based on bad information. You think that when you get to be as old as clinics with us, don't you think to you or your faculties have been compromised? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's almost 100 percent nothing thinking the same way he was.

Speaker 1:          01:33:39       He's not as sharp. No. Honest million dollar baby was really good. Yeah, but this is not that. It's also, it's the subject matter that he's prone to go into these very right wing and also you probably get over. You can't separate your feelings. He didn't have any feeling about women boxers exactly. Has deep feelings about this, but it's got to be 100 percent raw Rah Rah, and it's like, all right man, now you're not. Even if you were younger, you're still wouldn't be able to see this. It's like when someone, when someone talks like in their own words and you get to hear them talk in their own words, you get a sense of like, oh, I see why you created this piece of art. I see why this is your perspective. And when you saw that the Republican national convention thing, whatever the fuck it was when he was talking to Obama, that's, that's Clint Eastwood.

Speaker 1:          01:34:21       That was, you know, he. So he's so fucking crazy that he thought that up like on the spot. That was ad libbed, but you didn't even have anything planned out. This fucking guy is giving this speech in front of this gigantic group of people. He's so confident in his ideas. Then he's going to ad Lib a conversation with Obama complete with punchlines. Oh yeah. He comes from a non video world to where he's like, man. So it was a group of a thousand people completely confident in his position in life and who he is and he's a movie star has been a movie star for fucking 100,000 years. Everybody's been kissing his ass long before the Internet came along. He's also a guy that agreed to do a fucking reality show. Do you know that? Where his wife was in a reality show. His wife was in some crazy reality show, man, his wife, I don't know if they're still together. I think they might've got divorced, but he wanted to be a star, so she married when she was young and hot and then she did a reality show.

Speaker 4:          01:35:17       Well, I didn't know it. Yeah, it didn't last. I'm not sure if he's still with her. Has No real, real cool. I will look at worth it. I looked up an interview with Eastwood about directing the movie because I didn't understand how the guy at the Republican National Committee by this. Oh, well, I mean I was just like, Oh wow, this is such blatant propaganda. They're not even trying to make it subtle. This is just like war, war, time movie out of it. Yeah. Yeah. That I was curious like, okay, I wonder how involved eastwood was in directing this just based on what I saw at the Republican national convention. Didn't know it was improvised. So now that kind of explains it. I thought maybe he was just suffering from senile dementia or something

Speaker 1:          01:35:54       called Mrs Eastwood and company. It was on 2012. It was a reality show. So what the interview say though?

Speaker 4:          01:36:01       Well, the interview was, you know, it was just him saying like, he had actually been reading the book when they called and he said, let me finish the book. I've got 40 pages left and so I read it the next day and decided, you know, I was just a basic basic interview, but I just, it was just so appalled by that.

Speaker 1:          01:36:20       That was her. It's pretty God damn hot that his wife, it was his wife divorced him. Of course he would marry a super hot person. She's hot as fuck. Should compounds a wowza son. Yeah. Movie Star Yachty is what each expect. Yeah. You can't really say. You also have some that. Oh yeah. I also have a story that's out on youtube now. My first story, they put it out. Beautiful smuggling we did in Australia. Oh Shit. Cool. Don't talk about that on online. What are you doing? The beginning of it, I should say, this is all a lie you just got done talking about. Truthfully, you should be our reality. I don't do it anymore because the results of this story, but even then you could be like admitting to an Interpol related crime. I don't find any of that. You're going to fucking have every bag of garbage time and they have them like locked up by date labeled so that if you talk about something, they can go back to the house and they go, we found it. We found the bag. We got the rappers, best fucking kids on the pot and that you brought those. They'll find your DNA from the rapper, from your sweat though, isolate it, and they'll bring you up into some sort of tribunal. The next time you try to go to Sydney. Here's a little like care about that. Just youtube search. This is not happening already. Smuggles weeding into Australia. You can see it right now. You are gangster sir.

Speaker 4:          01:37:39       You know man, that makes me think it is a movie that's coming out. I'm really excited about. Timothy leary's kid is releasing this movie about his dad and and and Richard Alpert, but it's got all this like Bradley Cooper Place Timothy Leary. I heard. What's that documentary? Oh, I see. I missed it. God

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       Damn it. Sorry. Totally. That's such a slow ball too and I just thought he was going to give you acid to this kid and he wasn't going to. But then the kid picked up a Bible so he gave the kid acid. Now this the real movies of this sniper moment, the kid is about to pick up the Bible. I can't do it. Gets the eyedropper and squirts in the kid's mouth and you see the kids eyeballs dilate, falls back into a kaleidoscope and Sufjan Jesus. We hope you do to do something. Probably worse. Some of the more ridiculous than that. What smart people will see through this. Yeah. That's not as watching this though. Yeah. Those sniper movies aren't really for smart people, but it's cool to watch clinches. Timothy leary at the Senate hearings apologized to my data. Cool. Watching him like having to talk to Senate about lsd. It's bad ass. So he just, you apologize to your date while we were talking. I was like, ah. So I thought that'd be better. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:39:00       Just a poor pick. Um, uh, you get to pick the next one. That's hilarious. That's hilarious. Um, there's a lot of stories about this and I'm getting a shitload of tweets of people asking me, like to substantiate. But there's a lot of stories. It's all over online. What are the Himalayan? Yeah, the weld. The concerns are, I can't say I don't know who the fuck is. Right. And who's wrong? I didn't do any research. Clipped a jury to the jury, decided that Ventura was right, and then nothing else has been. They owe him. They, oh, I'm Jesse Ventura. One point $8 million dollars. Apparently one point eight, one point 9 million. Say one point seven, one point seven feet with the fight. So it's also crazy that that's how it's never like one point eight, one, three, seven, 4 million. Like it's not exact amount is the pain.

Speaker 1:          01:39:49       How do they come up with it? That narrowed it down to the close 800,000. That's so weird. Thousand to weird thing, man, to make a movie about a guy who might have been a liar and put those lines in a movie. And that gets all miracle. All frothy. I mean, well that means that, you know what that means? That means another fucking attacks coming. Does that what it means? So we had to get salt orchestrated because we've got to get people ready to join up. I don't think it's better than a draft. I guess if you got to pick between that draft and a, uh, that means for like ridiculous propaganda movies coming out every year. You know what I think? I think you shouldn't have no wars. We should fight no wars with anyone under 50. I think everybody who goes to war should be over 50 lps. Let's see. Let's see how quick we fucking settle this thing. I bet it would be pretty God damn quick. Oh, a bunch of old people that just don't want any trouble. I mean he was like, how can we, is there a way to solve this without shooting them? It's like those feet on the ground. He was coming at me and it's like, okay, but shooting him to death is the only way to stop a guy because you think about the consequences of the decisions or think

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       about the consequences of a decision to fly in a plane to a place where you've never been and shoot someone he never known based on the directions by some people who you don't know. We're making you march. They're making you go, shoo. Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. They're making you do all this shit preparing you for. You have to listen to them. Unquestionably known. Imagine that with 50 year old. Yeah, never going to happen. We're going to go wait a minute. Wait and why? We're shooting these guys winning and winning. We're breaking down. What door? Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you? And where'd you go to school? What's your degree in? And you're going to tell me about international politics. Do you even know these fucking Sunni's? What's the difference between the Sunni and Shia? Sir? Tell me what the difference is. Do you know?

Speaker 2:          01:41:36       Do you know why these people were at war with each other? Do you know why they hate each other? Do you know how to hate us? Do you know this is Holy Land. Do you know how long this has been? Holy Land. Do you know when they're in? If you had a group of 50 year old people there and slug it. I'm talking to you. Oh, you're allowed. So I have to listen. Is that what's going on? Oh, you don't have anything to say, but you're going to get my face in spit is that gonna make me intimidated and so I'll listen, so I'll just go and kill some people that you say are bad. If we did that, if we just had only 50 year olds and above go to war, the whole fucking thing would change. The whole thing. It's just it's easy to send fucking kids.

Speaker 2:          01:42:14       They don't know any better detail. Your cerebral cortex, your frontal lobe. They're saying like for young males, especially because fucking influx, the rowdy or not making rational decisions like when you're a 16 year old kid, your balls are filled with testosterone. There's a completely new experience. By the time you've got to be 40 years old, you've had a lifetime of wanting to come. A lifetime of like knowing what that is and knowing how to mitigate it. When you're 17, 18, you don't know what the fuck is happening to your body. You add into that masturbation guilt like people who were actually avoiding masturbation. Most of us don't, but there are some who so they try it as little as top of the white gloves on the guns when they get comments, when they put Megan where a white glove around something. Wasn't that a thing with white gloves and someone who's not matched with that going to blow this shit.

Speaker 2:          01:43:08       Every fucking one of those gopros under over your bunk and if they don't see you beaten off under the sheets, I can fucking asked you questions. Doctor, do you want to come in here and talk to us real quick? You got anything on your mind like maybe putting pussy or booties or something on your mind. You're trying to keep boys as social. I'm just thinking about killing right now was Duncan. This is not the type of soldier will good for and this here, army, we want well balanced individuals that make rational choices based on the evidence at hand, not based on lust, not based on a ball full of cum. Just waiting. A fucking g is all over some new part of the world to spread your fucking seed. My gun is my cock bullets. Serum Ige is and the brains of my job

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       are my pussy. Oh my God. And best moving to either go jim's dead bro Bro Bro, when you get up and leave, but like are you going to call me on American if I just think the filmmaking of this as bad. Manipulative. It is like you want to walk out, but simultaneously you feel like you're being. You want to go to 18 on this. This is kind of done this in an hour. I our 26 to 18

Speaker 1:          01:44:27       embarrassing. If this turns out that this guy really did make up all this shit because there's another article I'm looking at right now about the criticism of the Post Katrina in New Orleans story. Like how it's all total horseshit. How they can prove it tore shit cause he wasn't even there at that time. Oh yeah. It's like there's a lot of horseshit. You mean there's, there's, there's facebook and in the movie it's all. He's just trying to downplay all of his legend even though he's now. It's like he's the one who was saying it. Don't fall for this if you're wrong, good luck. Good luck her. I'm not supposed to. I'm not going to do out here, but for all of you, for it, they'll fry you, put you in life. And why aren't you looking at the spotter? Look, you an Iud. Will you just crouching behind a wall? I just fucking up his shot looking at extra pressure on this. There's a facebook page not endorsing this. I'm just letting you know this dedicated entirely to the subject and it's Chris. Kyle was a murderous liar. It's a community on facebook and it's all a bunch of different posts saying that, you know, saying how much it was bullshit. This is crazy, man.

Speaker 4:          01:45:32       Yeah, I guess people don't want to. It's really hard for people to digest the simple fact that Pete, that war makes a lot of money for a small amount of people. It's a profitable endeavor. And uh, if you want to make money in that industry, then you've got to convince heroes because that is the heroic ends. It's a really sweet mpulse the idea that I will give my life for you to protect you, to protect people. I don't know. That's the one of the highest human aspirations. It's like an incredible thing, but so you take those people who have this incredible aspiration to give their life to protect people and you lie to them and brainwash them and send them to a place to kill people based on this very incredible thing and leave the nfl and fucking give us. And by the way, well no, Pat Tillman did it on his own. We need you to do this. But Pat Tillman was a huge critic once he got over there, the, you know, he was killed by friendly fire and there's many people that have speculated they murdered him, that murdered him because he wouldn't shut the fuck up. Organize. Everything was about what a dog and pony show and everything was fucked up. The people that are to listen to, we're all assholes. Who was like, this is crazy. Like this is not what I signed up for. This is not what I wanted to

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       be in total chaos, which led to this fucking crossfire situation. It killed fucking talent to stop shooting and then they shot him. They shot his whole troop up. Though, I mean, look, when you start shooting things, that's the other thing. It'd become target and then say we've become targets. They don't comment on drone mistakes. They don't comment on the times when it's. It blows up a fucking wedding convention, which is most of the time that's why there's more mistake, the innocence and that our policy is not the comment on that. Like, wait, why is that an allowable policy? Yeah, the percentage is terrifying. If you look at the percentage of people that are actually killed by drones that are their intended targets, it's terrible. It shouldn't be terrorists, but they're not surgical strikes. How close is it? You're not. It's not a scalpel on the end of a fishing pole, you know?

Speaker 2:          01:47:33       It's just the idea that surgical is retarded. If we had drones going overhead and then I found out who's responsible for it yet, and I'm a little kid, I'm like, this is fucking Yemen drone that's over here. Killed my kids. Like, Goddamn right, I'm going to want attack Yemen. Stop fucking set of that shit over here. It killed my father. Yeah. Well, not only that, but why wouldn't they want to know? If you look at the, like we were talking earlier about what you were saying about this, these invading armies in Iraq and the other people that have ptsd and the birth defects. You've got to go way back to the original Gulf War. They were using fucking depleted uranium and everybody forgets about this. Everybody completely sweep this under the rug. It was proven. They use depleted uranium shells that blew right through fucking tanks.

Speaker 2:          01:48:17       This incredibly dense nuclear waste that poisons everything around it for 100,000 years and that was 25 years ago. We're expecting those 15 year olds who were the 40 year olds now to go, oh well I don't care anymore. No big deal, but not just forget about that time. You killed my entire family. Oh, and you're right here. Someone representing your governments right here. Totally cool, but it's something that we're not supposed to talk about. Just like the ideologies that we just discussed earlier, just like religion, it falls into a religion. Got To talk about Elysium falls into a religion. Don't all start talking about it, but you can't talk about it. Well, it's also because there are bad people keep talking about the weed. It's like that's why it's all lead because I've got another deal, right? Everyone talks about becomes normalized. You got to just talk about it all time.

Speaker 2:          01:49:01       Exactly. You're friends with whatever and it doesn't mean that you're done. This is where people get confused. It doesn't mean that there aren't heroes and doesn't mean you don't need a defense. You don't need to be able to protect yourself from some fucking North Korean asshole. That guy decides to start taking over the world. Like what if they had massive resources. We're lucky they're in a resource starved environment, so you have this communist dictator with nuclear weapons that a resource starved environment where they have to shut the lights off at night because they can't afford to keep them on, but if that guy had oil or gold or something crazy and like Saudi Arabia type money, if like one of those guys became some sort of a fucking world spreading villain, you need heroes. You need real soldiers that are willing to fight against bad people. That's what happened in World War Two, World War II when you had the Nazis and all that.

Speaker 2:          01:49:49       I mean, I'm sure there's all sorts of flexes. They use the justified war, uh, argument as proof to get us into sort of less way less justified war. We're sending them to the best thing to happen to the US army. When we're saying, look, now we can do anything. We just say we're doing the right thing. Exactly what is exactly the same thing we were saying about religion is that it's not that these people are bad people and it's not that God is bad. No one's saying that. But what we're saying is like, look what's being done in the name of this and look how there's no thinking. Whenever there's no thinking and horrific acts are being done, there's no thing. If you're ever in a situation where a fucking little kid has a rocket launcher, everybody should stop what they're doing. Get the fuck out of there and try to figure out a how.

Speaker 2:          01:50:35       How did this happen? Or B, how do you fix it and the way you don't fix this, but shooting kids that doesn't fix shit that just like the mother is doing now. Oakland PD is starting up like Youth Basketball Leagues and they're coaching and stuff to so the youth grow up. Not going fuck the police, but like, no, the police were cool there. Help sell it and stuff. That's like, you can't solve it right now, but 20 years from now it'll be better than it is now. Will also. What's happened in New York when they did the police slow down where they just wouldn't arrest anybody for anything. After those two kids got, oh, there's two cops got shocked by that one guy, that one guy who by the way also shot his fucking ex girlfriend, like the guy was a piece of shit to people to think he's a hero.

Speaker 2:          01:51:16       Like Jesus Christ. He shot his girlfriend first and then he went and shot those cops. He was a psychotic murderous person, but because of that act, the cops backed up. The cups finally started. Stopped fucking with people they need to stay where they're at right there. Yeah, exactly. What? Where they are right there. Cameras. Are you finding this camera's not saying that they should be scared all the time of being murdered, but I'm saying the attitude that they devote like, okay, we're not going to arrest anybody for anything. That's not important. That's all you should have ever been doing. Exactly. New Collector. It's illegal to sell cigarettes outside, so tell them to get lost or don't. You'll shake them down. How about you hire a fucking lawyer to go sue that guy and then you find out he doesn't have any money. He's not gonna pay anyway.

Speaker 2:          01:51:59       There's your problem. You got a problem with tax collecting. You don't have a pr. If that guy rob somebody, then you bring it up, Jay walking and he comes in and he breaks into your house and steals your TV. Then you have the cops, but anything, any use of that other than protecting people. Fucking choking a guy because he's not paying cigarette tax. What the fuck are the cops? It's not like New York plunged into chaos, but as they started enforcing, write him a ticket. You don't much nicer. The world would be if cops only acted in that slow down manner, but they don't act like that with big black man. There's a huge racism. It would be incredible. Don't act though where you've been there over the last few months. You moved there like half the uh. What is your experience like at the difference racism out here as opposed to erase all joined in here. We're wastes more separated, but

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       it's like, I don't think we see shit like why people don't even see the. Like they're constantly getting like, you don't want resisting. Arrest is, was this the residence after the first time someone's like, Hey, let me see your Id. And they grab you and they push you. The second time the same shit happens. A cop pushes you the fourth time out of your car and they grab your wrist and go, c'mon man. If you pull back, you've resisted arrest. Wow. Come on mom. I'm late for a movie. What? Let's just talk about this first. You've resisted arrest, right? It's up to their discretion whether or not they choose to arrest you or known restaurant people. Some people get off on the exact same charge and they skate. Whereas other people get arrested like a year old white guy with a suit and you do a certain thing to stop and Frisk was based on stop and Frisk people, Latinos and blacks who looked like they might have some shit.

Speaker 3:          01:53:29       Right. You didn't see it on Wall Street. You didn't see them. Of course, to getting stopped and frisked on Wall Street on Wall Street weren't as outraged about it. Stop and Frisk for shit that shouldn't be illegal in the first place. So that's like illegal search. It's like saying we're going to just search you, but we have no reason to search it and well, he could have been weapons, right? We shouldn't say we're looking for weapons they're looking for. I mean it's dope, man. They want to get you for that. Arrested you for dope or something that grows out of the earth that help scans. I'll be honest, if I. Yeah, if I'm a cop and I don't like you and I see something, even if I don't think it's wrong, if I'm a 23 year old, I'm like, well, I'm going to put you in jail now.

Speaker 3:          01:54:06       Meanwhile you don't even think it's wrong. Wall Street guy with a leather bound briefcase, it has your in your engraved with your initials and your family crest on it. They pull you over, they stop and Frisk, you pop open, you see a bottle of pills, heroin, heroin, pills, but on that bottle has your name on it. They will see heroin, but I've registered. You've registered, you've paid your taxes. The king got his price up. This doctor as well, you know, I know that people would abuse their privileges based on stuff they don't believe in. We have a comedian's basketball league and role playing and if it's directly they call technicals on curses and stuff and so if you hear somebody. Yup. Well they don't know what the comedians league. There's. We just made her own comedians league, but if we hear somebody cursing some other committee, if I hear fucking Jeff Dye curse, I'm cars, the cars and we all try to get a technical shit.

Speaker 3:          01:54:57       No comment believes they should be not allowed. Right? But isn't that just for fun? Like, but we want the fucking benefit. We're going to use our power so we don't believe in 23, somebody goes, fuck you cop. Like, well I'll look at anything I can to put you in jail right now. That would be like if we were playing pool and I go, oh, it's fucking shot. Oh, give me Paul enhance. Exactly because I cursed and you actually ask for it. No, no, no. Dude, you gotta give me a bond in. Be a decline. That rule. Douchey came. You guys do that playing basketball. You need to stop. You need to get on mushrooms and think about that call and technicals like that or not having your jersey. I'm like, we're comics. Nobody remembers to wash the Jersey and it's only comics playing against comics. We made our own league. So you know, it's an open mic at least to get on that thing. Hilarious.

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       We have one team, we call them the, the corporate sellouts and that's all the agents and managers. That's funny. Yeah. You know what you should do. You should recruit really fucking good players and just get them to do an open mic. Glassman shit. That's what he does. And he gets them to do one of the mic. Like No. The point is the play, the game of comics while having fun playing games with will used to have a comics, have a softball league back in Boston. Really? Oh my God. He would get so competitive. It was so crazy. It was like competitive people screaming at people over fucking fouls or, or were ball was in the ball was out, you know? I was like, oh my God. Yeah. I remember like people in each other's face throwing the gloves down, screaming at each other. A comics bat baseball game.

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       But that's Boston Davey babies without their bottles. I was back at Boston that they fixed that club, that laugh. Boston sound system is awesome. Okay. You don't have to worry about it anymore on the automation because everybody had that rumor that was out at the sound system. Sucked is loud as fuck it did feedback once when I got like on top of the, the, the actual speaker was talking about. But that happens almost everywhere, you know, unless it's perfect. It's something the Improv does you. There's never a fuck up if you're working in Improv. Like if the sound system's always perfect, the seeding is always perfect. There's never sight line issues. They don't ever fuck around. Like you know, some clubs that your work out there kind of funky. Like if you stand on one medium so you can't even see flyballs yeah. But it was worse because there's often pillars in the room and if you're behind that pillar and you will go to the right side, like the people that are behind that pillar literally can't even see you. Like they're there, but unless they're, they have to watch monitors in a club. The improv has that nailed. They always say like, nap. You got to set this up like that. Like all of them are like, nope, set it up like that, but this way it's got todd glass level approval. Tagless, helium, helium. He helped them design a place with helium in Philly. Listen, I got to go.
