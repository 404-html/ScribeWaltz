Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience sands process. Awkward moment ever is when they see like in Vegas, about five dudes hanging out together and there's no girls near him. And then they're getting a couple of drinks in them and they start sorta like half dance and they can't like totally commit to dancing, you know, so like little go through like half the moves. Like I'm not really an advocate of this music. It doesn't make me move that much. But you know, I'll give a little move, we'll get up a little move here and there, you know, but they can't like dance with each other. They can only move just a minimal amount. You can't get crazy gyrating hips. This is a, you're not allowed to do that to dude's girls can get together and dance all they want. But with dudes you can only sort of half dance. I said, God, just by myself.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes you should go out by yourself to clubs. Um, when I first moved to La I did, but I would go on the dance floor by myself. Oh my God, there's something wrong with your brain. You need to go to a doctor first. It's a little bad at first you didn't get to get the guys that are like, look, what's this guy doing? You kind of do it, but then you get the girls that come over to you because they liked the guy who, who's then we've done a lot of work. Yeah. It's a little gutsy. It was a very gutsy move. Got You. Moved. Not, not always worked. How many times is it failed on you? Oh, I don't even know. Probably more times than but that, but it just takes that one time. You know? Just that one time. Some dudes can take criticism and rejection rather.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Some dudes are fine with that. I have a friend, he would, he would hit on every girl that he was an ugly guy. It was. I was fat, but he didn't give a fuck. He would swing. He would swing at every pitch. I know a couple of Evernote that way that I know that he's a comic. I don't want to give him up on the air. I've owned you. Do you mind? Either, but you can't go to bars with that guy because it's too much to my, and then those are always the guys who let people know you're a comic. Like there's a whole bunch of comics that are that way. So they go up to the boundary like, Hey, we're the comics had to chuckle, hut. And then the bonds are usually like, I don't care what you want, free tickets or the want the girls to be impressed.

Speaker 1:          02:02          It's bad. It's brutal when you were, the dude will, you know, there's no way. If you go somewhere and there's a chick that he's not going to hit on her and it's not going to get annoying and it's not going to get embarrassing. Yeah, those guys are brutal. Or you know, it's like, okay, I can't hang out with you anymore because if I hang out with you and we go somewhere, you look and immediately just everything that moves the first fucking the waitress comes over. I think she's kind of, Oh man, look at that. And just talking to him. And then next thing you know all, it's all about this fucking waitress and him getting this, which was his number. I'm like, Whoa, I can't, you just have lunch, fucking Weirdo. And then they don't come to your table anymore cause they don't want to deal with Ya.

Speaker 1:          02:38          And then, yeah, exactly. And it, cause it works every 30th time. They fucking just want to put in those numbers, man. Yeah. Those crazy dudes, they just want to put in those numbers and if you're around them and be like, oh great, no, that's a person. Yeah, it's fucking disastrous, man. It's a shitty feeling. I would add, well they either move, when I was on by myself, I would go up to girls and say, my friends left me, can I dance by you? So I don't look like I'm dancing by myself. Then you dance. But here's, here's the trick, young guys, here's the thing. You have to commit to that and you don't talk to those girls. You don't go, can I Bebo and then, hey, what's up ladies? Then you ignore them. Ooh, okay. And then the cooler, one of the group will then kind of come over and go, you can then, then they'll let you into the circle if you're not completely hideous in and embarrassing them. Key is, is not to give him attention. After you do that little move. Wow, and then now you're the hurt animal in the forest. You're the bird with a broken wing and there'd be one nurturing girl in that group that will bring you in.

Speaker 2:          03:38          I just go up to him and go, Hey, I'm a producer like her

I started, I stopped for a second and think of how gross men are and how fucking, how much effort you put into creating the perfect environment where they think you're a nice guy or interesting or mysterious or cute or whatever the fuck you're doing. How much of most, most guys, every day focus is just to try to get girls to like him. 44 4% of the day. Yeah. That's Brian. Brian gets off for Brian's like Brian has no loads left. How much masturbation and girls he's got no loads left. He's got no time for your bullshit. Yeah,

Could you just need to hit out the fat? You spend too much time with that dancing clan. And what is your dancing plant, Brian? Just go up to and go, hey

And I go, Hey, let me or refragmented your iPod for you. She goes, what is it running slow? And I'm like, yeah, let me re fragment for you.
