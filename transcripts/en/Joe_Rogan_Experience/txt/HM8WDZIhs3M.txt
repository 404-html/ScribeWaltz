Speaker 1:          00:00:01       I try so hard. Boom. And we're live Hamilton Morris sober as fuck. How about you? Absolutely. Say yes this time. So we did a podcast seven years ago and most people apparently didn't know how fucked up we were, but uh, I figured, damn, we're here with Hamilton Morris. We should go deep. And we just kept hitting that joint until I lost most of my grasp on reality while we're talking. It's just a very slippery conversation. I was just too high to form coherent thoughts. It was just whatever I pieced together was just a, you know, it was almost like miming a conversation, but now seven years later and you have a new place. Yeah. That's beautiful. Yeah. Well you were at the early days. We did it at my house. Yeah, that was way, way, way back in the day. I had no idea really. I knew you were of course, but I didn't know about your podcast entirely.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       I'd seen clips of you on youtube and it wasn't until I was driving home from that recording and my phone just filled with hundreds of emails that I realized, Oh wow, this is a serious phenomenon that I was not aware of and now I see. It's just become huge. It's a weird thing, dude. It, it's a, it's got the wheel. I just sort of have to show up. It's a very strange and it sounds like, um, false modesty or something like that, but I'm just being totally honest, like this thing does itself. I think a lot of it might have to do with the long form because people are so used to seeing people's opinions condensed and filtered into these soundbites and snippets and to hear an extended conversation with someone where they can actually tell stories and articulate their opinions and a nuanced careful ways.

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       So rare. I agree. It's one of the reasons why I don't do those shows anymore, like panel shows and things like that. It's just so frustrated. It's insane. I have very little experience with that sort of thing, but I did Dr Oz last year. Yes. And I don't know how any normal person could function and that sort of environment. I mean, I have a TV show, so arguably I'm well trained for that sort of thing, but unless you're an actor who's prepared a line to say, as soon as they point at you, there's no way that you could function because it's not a genuine conversation. It's just an opportunity to launch one sentence, sound bites and an audience applause. And also the audience is such a strange element to add to a conversation. I mean, if you and I were having this conversation exactly in this room, but to the left of us is an enormous group of people.

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       We've feel weird. We'd have to address them, we'd have to turn to them. It would be odd following illuminated applause and laughter signs. God. Those are the weirdest. When there's always the warmup guys like, okay, we're ready. We're coming back from break coming back from Craig and they hold up the sign and applause, applause, applause. And everybody goes crazy. And the create the worst environment. I was on this, uh, discussion about [inaudible]. Are you familiar with this? I'm on it right now. Oh Wow. Yeah. I just took some. I, I fucked my knee up the other day. I did something and it's been stiff and painful. So I used it before I came here and then I just took, took six of them. See what happens. Wow. 10 ones. 10. One gram. I don't know how much. I don't know. Can you grab that bag? There's a bag that's sitting right on the sink.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       I'll tell you exactly what's in it. But uh, now I get why people might think it's a drug. What is the drug? Yeah, for sure. But when I took four, I was like, well, I took two for the first time I took it. I took two and a couple of times I took to him. Look, this is like a mild stimulant, but then when you get into the range of eight to 10 pills, it's like, oh, this, this will fuck you up. This stuff. The stuff I take is urban ice organics and um, see it says, it says take two. It doesn't say the amount of material in the capsule was say 750 milligrams. Okay, so not quite a gram, not quite a gram. All right. It seems like a reasonable amount, but they always construct these things in these ridiculous dramatic oppositions. Like it was me versus a woman whose son had died of some Creton associated overdose, and it turns into a thing like, well, what do you have to say to this woman whose son died?

Speaker 1:          00:04:32       And it's like, I don't know. You know, there are people that die from caffeine overdoses as well. It's tragic that this happened. How people died from this. Yes. They have to have to take an enormous amount. I mean, I think a lot of people set up these unrealistic expectations with these drugs where they, if they'd like a drug, they want to say it's impossible for it to kill anyone. It's impossible. There's no possible way. If you set that as your standard, you'll always fail because people will die doing absolutely everything. Running, having sex deprecating aspirin, aspirin. Absolutely. There's nothing in this world that can't find its way into a human death. So if people want to say, and even you know, cannabis, obviously people say you can't overdose on cannabis and essentially you can't. But if you look in the medical literature, there are a number of these cannabis associated fatalities.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       You know, you can debate them endlessly, but the point is, once a drug enters a large enough population, there'll be a number of sensitive individuals and someone will die. It doesn't mean that the drug is dangerous. It means that it's unrealistic to set a standard where if anything bad happens to anyone, we have to decide that the drug is dangerous and should be banned. Yeah, I agree. I mean, look, water kills people. There's a lot of these hazing things where the fraternity kids will be asked to drink a shit ton of water and Oh yeah, people have died from it. A woman died in San Jose a few years back from a, a contest to drink water, get her son like an xbox or something like that. Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's a lot of things that are lethal, but the ld 50 for cannabis, I mean, you literally have to smoke your body weight or something.

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       Right. It's something crazy would be very difficult, you know, but it doesn't mean that you couldn't get so high that you did something really stupid wind up dying. Right? Yeah. Especially dependent upon the person and the biological variability. Right, right. Exactly. And it's just. I think it's also just as sort of a bad road to go down. People always want to emphasize the safety of things, but in my opinion, safety isn't the point. It doesn't ultimately matter to me whether or not something is safe. I think we should have the freedom to do dangerous things if we choose. We're allowed to ride. Motorcycles were allowed to shoot guns. You're allowed to go skydiving and bungee jumping. All those things carry risks, but it's assumed that any adult that does them is aware of those risks. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I mean it's, it's also who is.

Speaker 1:          00:06:53       If the society that we live in was just you and I was, we were the only two people alive who are you to tell me what I can do or me to tell you what you can do. It's ridiculous. And so when you have grown adults telling a grown adult who's informed what they can and can't do, then it becomes a question of children. Well then it becomes an education issue and it becomes a parental issue. I mean it's just, you can't lie to your children about the effects of certain drugs because then they're not going to believe you about the really actual, the actual dangerous ones. Right? And this is of course reflected in the so called opioid epidemic. Yes. Right now, yes. There's endless finger pointing. Everyone wants to find a culprit that's behind all of it. And the easiest person to blame, of course our pharmaceutical companies because everybody hates pharmaceutical companies, so why not blame them?

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       But you know, and I'm not pro pharmaceutical by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm also not anti pharmaceutical either. And when you look at the way, for example, the New York Times is covering the opioid epidemic, it's always in this tone of like documents were uncovered, the show that executives at Purdue Pharma, we're aware that morphine was addictive as early as 1999. And it's like, well, of course, of course they were aware of. People have known that morphine is addictive for hundreds of years. This is old news and this whole idea that doctors were convinced by some letter in the New England Journal of Medicine that said that Oxycontin isn't addictive, is absurd. These are all morphine derivatives. Any adult, especially a medically trained adults, should know that no matter what little variation you make on that molecule, if it's structurally and pharmacologically and qualitatively similar to morphine, of course it's going to be addictive. And that in of itself isn't even a bad thing. It should be okay to give people addictive drugs as well. As long as everyone's aware of the risks, as long as they understand the protocol to get off of it. You, you know, there's so many people that get on these things and then wind up taking them far longer than they're supposed to because it's easy to get hooked. I mean we need to at least have some sort of responsible

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       direction of these people need to go to, to get off of them once they're on them because people that get back operations, any anything where they prescribe you high doses of opiates, it's a huge problem. I know many, many people that have gotten hooked because of, and in fact I should tell you that my good friend Justin wren, his wife found out about Kratom because of you, because of your show, he had a problem with his shoulder, got shoulder shoulder surgery, they put them on Oxycontin's. He was fucked up on them and he was having a really hard time getting off and having the shakes really bad. And Kratom is the only thing that got them off it.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       Right. And that's not surprising. I mean this has been known for a very long time in Thailand and that was actually the reason that it was originally prohibited. I don't know if you're aware of that, but because the government taxed opium and people started using Creton, then they made Creton Elisa the right way to say it because people say Kratom, you're the only one I've heard say Krypton people in. It's a Thai word. People in Thailand call it people in the US called Kratom. It's, I, it's also, they have, you know, is maybe it's like Crikey, dom, something that we're not going to go to that forever. Tom is closer. If you did, it would be weird, but I feel as you know, like American people that say Ecuador, Argentina, but it is Creton Creton. Okay. So we'll try to call it quits or something close to that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       It's closer to that thing. Kratom. And so the reason why I was made illegal was because of the fact that it was pinching some of the profits off of the opium trade. Yes. Wow. Yeah. That's fucked up. And so this has been known for a long time that it helps people get off more addictive opioids. And how does it do that? Well, it's an opioid itself and a lot of people don't want to admit or acknowledge that, but I think we need to get beyond this idea that drugs are inherently bad or opioids are inherently bad just because the ones that we're aware of have a lot of problems, you know, in some sense, medicinal chemistry and pharmacology and all of this are still in a very primitive state and there's so much to be learned. So we're mostly giving people these derivatives of morphine that have been around for a hundred years and there are better things.

Speaker 1:          00:11:05       We're going to continuously discover less addictive treatments for pain and I think that the alkaloids in Kratom are a step in that direction and which is so tragic that they're trying to now make it illegal because this is something that as far as I can tell, has genuinely helped an enormous number of people reduce their intake of more addictive and more dangerous opioids. Well, one of the things that I've felt, I mean, and again, my dose was not extremely high, but when I was on it, I was very coherent. I was clear. It was clear to me that was affected by something, but it felt kinda good. It didn't feel bad. It felt a little, a little uneasy, like a little like, whoa, this world feels a little weird right now, but it not feel like A. I was impaired. Like I know a lot of people who take it an exercise, like a, I have a friend, he'll take 10 pills and exercise just just seems kind of fucking crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:12:07       But he says he has a great workout. Right. We're taking that stuff before he works out. Yeah. I mean it seems to lend itself to a lot of different applications in Thailand. It's used almost exclusively for that sort of purpose. In the south, it's a drug that Labor is used so they can collect the latex foam, rubber trees and just get their job done. That's what it's about. I mean, that's what opioids are about for a lot of the world, both in the United States and in Africa and in Thailand is, you know, people live hard lives and, and manual labor is painful and repetitive and difficult and anything that makes that a little bit more manageable is very important tool for humans. I always felt like people that did heroin or opiates or something like that, we're on a very short road to death that, that was my perception when I was a kid.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       And then I had a friend who was a longshoreman. They worked on the docks bring. They would bring fish in and fillet the fish for the market. And um, he worked with a guy that everyday at lunch the guy would go cop, he would get his heroin, who would shoot it up in his car and then he'd go back to work and I was like, he'd go back to work and you're like, Yup. He worked everyday, like everyday shot up and everyday he worked like, yeah, it was never late. Nope, just did his work. Wow. I didn't think you could do that. I thought you did heroin, the next thing you know, you'd just be on the floor in a fetal position, in your own urine and you would fall apart and die. Right? Yet there's this idea that people sometimes refer to as pharmacological determinism that a certain drug has to do a certain thing, so alcohol has to sedate and disinhibit you.

Speaker 1:          00:13:45       Heroine has to addict you and make you a slave to it and kill you. Cocaine has to be a euphoric thing that's done at parties. That's also very addictive. PCP has to make you strip nude and run around a fighting, constantly fighting cops and punching holes and wooden fences. Um, but when you look at this, you know, anthropologists have looked at certain drugs that are used cross culturally like alcohol. And what you find is this whole idea of pharmacological determinism is fundamentally flawed. Drugs behave differently in different cultures depending on the set and setting of the user. And so you find all sorts of instances that are major exceptions to these rules that we've set up for these various drugs. For example, PCP, which is arguably one of the most ubiquitously maligned drugs in the world, I mean no one can imagine that PCP is medicinal, but even to this day, pcps and schedule to not schedule one like cannabis and LSD schedule to it can still be prescribed actually. And that's because it had a history of medicinal

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       use. There was even PCP psychotherapy in the UK, in the, in the fifties. So this is a something that most people wouldn't believe, but to those patients that were taking it, then there was none of this cultural association with PCP being a drug that causes psychosis or makes you strip nude, who is simply another tool for a psychiatrist to use and help people release repressed memories or traumas that they were afraid to talk about when sober.

Speaker 4:          00:15:21       Well, we're seeing that now with Mtma, right? I mean, and also ketamine, ketamine, you being used as an actual tool for psychotherapy, particularly for people with depression. So having really good results. My, um, my friend, excuse me, Neil Brennan, who is a hilarious comedian. He's had struggles with depression. He, he got great relief from, uh, from

Speaker 3:          00:15:44       taking ketamine. Right. And what I think is really interesting is, you know, this is often packaged as a sort of psychedelic renaissance, but I think in a larger context, it's a drug facilitated psychotherapy renaissance because this was not just limited to psychedelics. People did something called narco analysis where they would give people sedatives like propofol. The drug that killed Michael Jackson or um, various barbiturates or various other drugs and the relaxing effect would allow people to talk more openly to a therapist. And it was considered very effective. Now this idea of a psychiatrist injecting you with a drug in order to help you talk about your problems is it's unheard of. I don't think anyone does it anymore, but it used to be very common and I think a return to that is going to be really beneficial.

Speaker 4:          00:16:32       Yeah, I, I agree with you. I think the right drugs with the right cases and the right people, and I think we've got to get past these schedules that when you have things like marijuana and silicide been and especially DMT, which your own body produces is a schedule one drug and the famous Terence Mckenna line. We're all holding. You know, when it comes to Dmt, it's just stupid. It's just stupid that these things are scheduled one. When you're saying there's no medical benefit whatsoever, a medical application for cannabis is fucking crazy. When something that you want to have something that really actively promotes a distrust in law enforcement, the scheduling of drugs is one of the best ones because when you look at something like marijuana and you see that that's a schedule one drug that, that that's infuriating to people that gain huge benefits from cannabis.

Speaker 4:          00:17:25       I mean people that have going through chemotherapy, people that have, you know, a interocular pressure from Glaucoma. I mean you can go down the list over and over and over again. The kids that have epilepsy, there's so many people that have had great benefit, particularly from edible cannabis. People that have seizures, I mean you could keep going on and on and on. It's just, it's an amazing plant and to have that demonized because of some ridiculous propaganda from the 19 thirties that still somehow or another clung on in 2018. We think about all the information we have now with the Internet and the fact that cannabis is still scheduled. One, you have assholes like jeff sessions still saying things like, good people don't smoke marijuana like this is crazy talk.

Speaker 3:          00:18:13       It's crazy, but keep in mind it was just about a 100 years ago that alcohol was prohibited in the United States and it took 13 years to reverse that and that was alcohol. There's no drug more integrated into our culture than alcohol and that took 13 years to reverse.

Speaker 4:          00:18:29       What was that like back then? That must have been madness when alcohol was illegal. When the cops would come in and jackbooted thugs would knock over jen mills and bust open kegs of whiskey and spill it all out. Like, what the fuck was that like?

Speaker 3:          00:18:43       It was. It was disastrous. But I think what's interesting about that is it was a worthwhile experiment to give them the benefit of the doubt. It was worthwhile to see because on some sense you could say the prohibition has a certain logic to it. You could say drugs caused problems. So if we just make all the drugs illegal, then maybe those problems will disappear, but it didn't work. The experiment failed. And there's nothing wrong with a failed experiment, but it's a problem if you keep repeating it over and over and over again for 100 years looking for a different result.

Speaker 4:          00:19:15       Right? And then go to other drugs and go, well, this one, let's try this one. Let's make this one illegal. And it's a terrible

Speaker 3:          00:19:22       pr situation for the police as well. If I were a police officer, I'd be the biggest opponent of the war on drugs and have anyone in the government. Because when you think about why does the average person in New York City love of firefighter, they love firefighters, but they hate cops. Why is that? It's because of the drug war. Because a firefighter isn't going to hurt you for something that wasn't really a crime to begin with, for some kind of victimless crime. A firefighter is just there to help you to save you if you're in trouble, and the same would be true of police officers if it weren't for the drug war. Ideally

Speaker 4:          00:19:55       there's a little more complexity to it. There's certainly certainly more complexity when it comes to shootings and things along those lines, but I mean the stop and frisks. I've read something about stop and Frisk in New York when they had, when they had that instituted that most of it was drugs. Most of it was like catching people with marijuana.

Speaker 3:          00:20:14       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:20:15       Which is just fucking insane. You just stay. You look like you might be street. Get over here

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       and that's the way these laws have functioned from the very beginning. I mean, if you look at drug law in the UK, it tends to be very black and white. Something is legal or illegal. If it's legal, it can be sold in stores because it's legal. If it's illegal, it can't be sold anywhere in the US. They've instead created this nebulous far reaching gray area where there's all sorts of things that are maybe illegal, kind of illegal, do it, but don't get caught and uh, and it's created and ability for the government to selectively prosecuted people whenever they want, if they want. Mm. Yeah. Well that seems to be lessening.

Speaker 4:          00:21:00       I mean, when you have someone like Jeff sessions in office, it's very disturbing, but then trump says things like he's very strong on states rights to past marijuana laws and things along those lines.

Speaker 3:          00:21:15       You're very incredulous. No, no. I mean, I, I suppose I am a bit incredulous when it comes to trump doing anything good. But, uh, I think if you told him that people love him more, if he did things good, he would do things good. That's probably true. I think of someone that he trusted said, yeah, I think that's as I think we've got to get somebody in deep. We've got to get them all in there. Got To get somebody who's good at back rubs get, gets back on the podcast and I think that'll help. I doubt it will help. I mean, it just, I don't know, what is the thing that'll help.

Speaker 4:          00:21:48       There's also the separation between the drug users and the policymakers.

Speaker 3:          00:21:53       Yes, and one thing that I am certain will help, and it's sort of tragic that this is the case, but it's capitalism. It's the corporatization of these drugs because with cannabis, um, you know, when it was hippies and the counterculture having marches down the streets of New York holding up for 20 signs, it doesn't, I suppose have all that much clout in the eyes of lawmakers, but when you have some guy from Yale business school who's never smoked weed, who says, you know, this is a serious business opportunity, we're going to make it big and gets investors, invest millions and millions of dollars into it. Hires lobbyists, plays the game like a capitalist. Then the laws do change and I wish that weren't the case, but it is. And it's tragic for the people that did fight and did go to prison and did sacrifice that. Then these, these business school guys come along and reap all the benefits, but that's the way it works. Yeah. That is the way it is

Speaker 4:          00:22:54       and that's okay. I mean it's just a weird path. It's a weird path, but as long as we can get to legalization, I'm 100 percent for that path. I just think that might be the only way in this weird country, this country is so enamored with money. I mean we're, we're so enamored with money and profits and even for dying people, even old people like Warren Buffet invested shit. Tons of money in warehouses to sell to, to grow cannabis in Colorado when the laws were passed. I mean that guy has 150,000 years old. He's worth billions of dollars and he's like, who gives a shit? I'm making more money now and more and more and more. I mean even when they're really old, they're massively motivated by profit.

Speaker 3:          00:23:37       Yes, and I think the same will be true for psychedelics and we'll probably be true for all of these things because you need to have lobbyists need to have this sort of typical white collar support to push things forward.

Speaker 2:          00:23:51       I agree. I just, I don't see any other way around it right now. I mean, the real hope is that cannabis, not that it will get rid of capitalism, but that we'll figure it out. It's hard to wear those things with glasses on, right? Yes. They are always talking about it. The glasses digging your head that cannabis will. W did not just cannabis, but Campbell's will open the door to all these different substances that will allow people to have to gain a greater perspective. This is the ultimate goal, in my opinion, is to give people the opportunity to step outside of the momentum of their lives and look at things with fresh eyes and make clear decisions. This is one of the best things that I think that drugs provide is that these psychedelic drugs in particular provide an escape from the momentum of this life that you've created or that you found yourself a part of. It's very difficult for people to stop behavior patterns to stop and just look at themselves objectively and sort of rethink, regroup and reassess and this is one of the best things about cannabis and about suicide, but in a lot of these other psychedelic drugs is that it gives you this newfound perspective that allows you to reconsider things.

Speaker 3:          00:25:07       Yes, absolutely. And I think with Ketamine in the treatment of depression, it's a similar idea because depressed people become used to these very ingrained patterns of thinking and anything that can break you out of that, that can shake it up for a minute and maybe give you a different perspective I think is inherently therapeutic. Yeah, I think so as well. And I think

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       I'm hoping that what I see, and this is what I believe I see, is that we're changing our perceptions of it. I had a conversation with a friend of mine the other day about marijuana where, uh, we were talking about, um, how you used to hide whether or not you did it from certain people and now that group of people that you have to hide it from a smaller and smaller and that it seems like everyone casually smokes marijuana now in, in our circles, there's so many people that do. There's a few that don't sober people in whatever, but it's way more common. Whereas 10, 15 years ago, this was something you hid if you had a good job, if you had a family. This is not something you want people to know about

Speaker 3:          00:26:14       in. What I think is really interesting is that in and of itself changes the nature of the cannabis experience. So I think if somebody uses cannabis in a culture that supports it, that approves of it, their experience will be better by virtue of that fact. So there's a certain shame that a lot of people feel when using any drug I, for whatever crazy reason, feel it a little bit with cannabis. It's a little just a hair of I should be, you know, I should be studying, should be reading. They should be you more focused. This is a little hedonistic. It's little comfort oriented. I should be working harder, but that's I think just the vestiges of this propaganda that I've been fed or something like that. Or maybe it's true, but I understand from one perspective why the cannabis culture, drums, the benefits of cannabis so hard.

Speaker 3:          00:27:05       You know that it cures all disease, that it's good for you, that it cures cancer, all this stuff. Because if you have that in your mind, at the very least, it's going to reduce that sort of internal shame that you might feel it makes the entire experience healthier and more beneficial because we do construct these limitations. We construct these experiences to some extent. So if you decide that cannabis is a dissociative drug that's hedonistic and comfort oriented and will take you away from your responsibilities and that's what it will become, but if you decide like Terence Mckenna did, that it's an intellectual catalyst that it will facilitate your ability to read and learn and think and write, then it will become that as well.

Speaker 4:          00:27:41       Yeah, it's, it's a weird one, right? Because people that are people that take it, that are prone to paranoia or that are dealing with some difficult issues in their life right now that they're perhaps trying to avoid, it becomes an uncomfortable experience. Whereas people that are happy and having a good time and in a good place, the marijuana will sort of enhance that. He was loving, warm feeling of, of comfort and have like sort of acceptance of your existence and it's going to be okay.

Speaker 3:          00:28:14       Right? But I think even the paranoia is like a sort of sort of, um, meme you could say a sort of vestige of this propaganda that makes people afraid in the same vein as the bad trip. I think the concept of a bad trip is a very damaging concept because, and I know from personal experience, I never really used psychedelics in high school with the exception of Salvia, um, because I was terrified of a bad trip. Talk to friends who'd described bad trips and they say, oh, it's bad. It's bad trip. It's really bad. It's scary. And I would think, oh, that's terrible. I could, I would never want a bad trip. I'm never going to touch these things because a bad trip would be too much for me to tolerate. And then I started using psychedelics and I realized there's no such thing as a bad trip anymore than there's a bad meal or a bad relationship or a bad day.

Speaker 3:          00:29:04       I mean, having an occasional bad thing in life doesn't stop you from doing things like eating or having relationships or living typically. So what do you mean by this? Are you saying there's no such thing as a bad trip saying there's no such thing as a bad meal? I'm saying that there is such thing as a bad meal but. But it wouldn't prevent you from tripping. And I think that even the bad or wouldn't prevent you from eating rather sorry about that, but uh, but I think even these bad trips, although they can be difficult, are beneficial and our learning experience in the same way that a bad meal could be. You learned not to go to that restaurant or maybe you learned something about what makes you sick or what to be careful of in the future. You, if you are approaching life from a non fearful perspective where your intention is to learn, then you can extract benefit from almost any experience and these difficult psychedelic experiences.

Speaker 3:          00:29:53       I genuinely believe, and this is what is maybe the hardest thing to communicate about psychedelics, is that it's the difficult ones that are often the best. Those are the ones that really teach you something. And when you're trying to talk about psychedelics with people who've never used them, it's not a great selling point to say, oh, you know, the best thing that can happen is you're going to think you're going to die. But that is arguably the best thing that can happen. To think that you're going to die because that's a confrontation with the overarching fear, the fear of that generates all other fears and if you conquer that fear, then

Speaker 4:          00:30:27       your life will almost certainly improved. Well, what is one thing that's sort of genuine, genuinely universally accepted as a beneficial experience is a near death experience, sort of universally accepted as a transformative moment in people's lives. Like I had this near death experience and I realized, wow, I gotta get my shit together. After that heart attack, I realized that life is a gift and I changed the way I think about things and I started calling people that I loved and telling them that I loved them. This is the same. You can get a near death experience from cannabis. You just don't ever tie, but you really do. I mean, it's the death of so many perceptions and so many things about your life, especially from edible cannabis, which I think is probably one of the least understood and most potent things that people are consuming on a daily basis. I, I can't tell you how many times I've given someone edible marijuana in their fucking convinced that it's been laced with something awful and that they're going to die, but then afterwards they come out of it and they're like, oh, so I got some work to do. The only way I would disagree with you is people that are prone to psychotic breaks because that there, there is an absolute genuine connection between people who have a slippery hold on reality and some experiences with psychedelics that lead them down a bad road.

Speaker 3:          00:31:50       That's true. It can. It's a stressor and like all stressors, it can precipitate a psychotic break. A, they've done pretty large scale epidemiological analyses of psychedelic drug users versus the non psychedelic drug using population and the incidence of mental illness isn't any higher. So I don't think you can argue that psychedelics cause mental illness, but you can add it in some measures. It seems to actually reduce it in terms of things like alcoholism, substance abuse disorders. But, um, but it can be a stressor that would precipitate such an episode in a susceptible individual. And I had a very traumatic and formative experience myself for my best friend had a psychotic break while I was with him tripping. So I've seen this firsthand. I know exactly what it looks like. Yeah. I've had friends.

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       I have real

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       bad experiences too where they're screaming and yelling and then disassociative and then afterwards become very strange and have a really hard time with reality for a bit. Yeah. I've never seen someone have a complete psychotic break promise that he never recovered. He never, he never recovered. He was my best friend at the time and he never recovered. So he was fine before the psychedelic. Yes. Jesus Christ light again. You know, it's. And that happened early. So now he's still fucked. Yes. But again, you know, I, I typically don't tell that story in public because it's could be misinterpreted as a scare story. You know, I don't. It's impossible to prove the counterfactual. Would it have happened without psychedelics? Almost certainly. I can't say. All I know is that he took a very high dose of a Silicon Ester and um, had this episode, he was hospitalized and he was not the same afterwards. So I'm aware that this is something that happens, but it also typically happens in the early twenties, late teens, the same time that people typically have psychotic breaks and develop schizophrenia. Yeah. The incident.

Speaker 4:          00:33:51       This is of schizophrenia in people who use cannabis are a cannabis in particular, but I don't know about other psychedelics, but I would imagine they're very similar. They're exactly the same as the incidences of schizophrenia and non using populations. It's like one percent, one percent across the board seemed to have issues with schizophrenia. And the real question is how many of those people could mean isn't avoidable if your friend had never done that and instead had become a marathon runner or something and know, found some other outlets for his energy, would he have never gone down that road? We don't know. It's impossible. It's impossible. So I think it's very important to talk about that though. And with further research, perhaps we could isolate jeans they have for cte now they have, they can do an analysis of your genes and then determine whether or not something like football and be a dangerous path for you because you have a higher probability of developing cte. It would be wonderful if they figured out a way to do that with psilocybin or with cannabis or with anything else and be able to recognize the potential links to psychotic breaks and to, you know, a host of different mental disorders that could possibly be triggered by high doses.

Speaker 3:          00:35:13       Yes. I mean this is one of so many things that needs to be done and that's, you know, everyone's very excited about all of this clinical research that's happening right now. I'm excited about it as well. But on one level it is very politically oriented research, you know, the things that they're looking at have actually typically been done before. Not all of it, but the aim is to firmly establish these things that have been known for a long time. Silicide been occasions, mystical type experience or Mtma is useful for treating ptsd or psilocybin has an anti addictive effect. These are things that people have known for a little while, but now it's about proving it, but I'm really looking forward to getting deeper into these serious questions about, you know exactly how these drugs interact with various subtypes of serotonin receptors because I think that they're going to be very important tools for understanding consciousness as a whole.

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       Yeah. It would also be interesting knowing how they react to different diets. You know, when people are, you know, when you're eating certain types of foods that are bad for your body, I would really be curious to see what kind of effect that has. I mean when, when you have real large scale research that goes over really important variables in terms of human health and then you add in these different substances, whether it's silicide or cannabis or whatever it is. It's, it's gonna be interesting to see how the body reacts to these various preturbances, these various changes of your state.

Speaker 3:          00:36:52       Yeah, and that's, you know, traditionally in a lot of these indigenous groups, the Diet plays a big role in the way that the drug is administered and I think we're slowly rediscovering a lot of things that have been known for tens, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands of years, and some of these indigenous groups. Have you had a chance to see any of my new show? No, no, I haven't. Oh, I think you'd like it. I'm sure I'd liked it. I liked her old show. This is, I think it's a lot better than the old show. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, but I, you know, I had the opportunity to look at the way Salvia is used in the mountains of Wahaca and you know, native American peyote use and all these different things and yeah, there's so much to be learned from all of these traditions that are not reflected in the current clinical climate because they can't be.

Speaker 3:          00:37:42       But I think that that's going to be a part of it is slowly integrating these other alkaloids that are present in the plants to see what role they play in the same way that, you know, the initial medicalization of cannabis was Marinol, which is just phc and sesame oil, but now there's increased understanding of the way these accessory cannabinoids modulate the thc experience or whether thc is even the primary therapeutic agent for certain disorders. And I imagine the same thing will be true for Peo Odi and for the Iboga alkaloids and probably even for some of the chemicals found in mushrooms.

Speaker 2:          00:38:17       So when you're doing this show, have you had any problems? Have you had any, uh, push back against what you're doing or any, any issues with it? Being on vice?

Speaker 3:          00:38:31       I've had an enormous amount of freedom, you know, ultimately I have very little to complain about when it comes to censorship. There was, um, it, the way the show got started, the actual TV show is sort of an interesting story where they were starting up vice land and a producer who's now gone a gave me this deck of drug stories they were going to do and there are all kinds of terrible scare stories like the new drug Bromo Dragon flying. It's killing teens and new drug Bromo driving. Yeah. Yeah. What does that, it's a really fascinating compound developed by this chemist David Nichols, who, um, found that, that these confirmation, highly constrained Benzo fear in a amphetamine derivatives are like very high potency dob derivatives. Anyway, it's just a, it's a super potent psychedelic amphetamine that has a cool tryciclics structure. Huh? Then it looks like a dragon fly.

Speaker 3:          00:39:24       The molecule looks like a dragon fly kind of. And it's got a very high, isn't it? It's super, super potent and very, very long lasting. So it lent itself to scare stories. Um, you know, people, it is a potent vasoconstrictor so people will take very high doses of it and occasionally they would have to amputate a finger or something like that. But again, you know, this isn't because the drug is bad, it's because people used it irresponsibly and this is something that people have so much difficulty understanding. We're so eager to blame drugs for all of our problems. Drugs have never heard anyone. They're just inanimate constellations of carbon and hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. They don't jump out of their bags and vials and attack your serotonin receptors for dopamine transport or anything like that. So this is just a weird pattern that we've done repeatedly over time.

Speaker 3:          00:40:18       And I don't know if you read the new Michael Paulin book. I know he was on the podcast I'm in right now. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, it is great. But, um, one thing that I thought was interesting about it is that he put a lot of the emphasis on the prohibition of psychedelics on leary and leary almost certainly played a role, but I think it's slightly ironic that he's a journalist and didn't really go that deep into the role that journalists played in all of this, which was humongous. You know, journalists are sculptors of public opinion and it became the standard way of reporting on any of these things to say that they're bad, to sensationalize it and to not have any consideration for what that would do because anytime a journalist writes him scare story, they can really mess with drug policy in a serious way.

Speaker 3:          00:41:06       It might seem like nothing like, oh, there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn and they overdosed on some obscure synthetic cannabinoid amb food minuka who cares about amb food Venica no big deal. Say that it turns people into zombies and if it gets thrown into schedule one, who cares? Not a big deal. Well, that's a very short sighted way of thinking about all of this because that's exactly what happened with psychedelics and then we're not learning from the mistakes of the past that just because something it's fun to sensationalize and talk about how dangerous it is at this moment doesn't mean that 10 years from now we're going to recognize it as serious therapeutic potential and we made a big mistake outlawing it and I think a lot of that also comes from this sort of us versus them mentality that people have where it's cannabis is good.

Speaker 3:          00:41:52       Synthetic cannabinoids are bad. Well synthetic cannabinoids don't have to be bad for cannabis to be good. Cannabis can be good without something else being bad. To counterbalance that you don't need to hate something to justify your love of cannabis and this whole hatred of synthetic cannabinoids I think is totally misdirected because these are products of prohibition that most people wouldn't even want to use in the first place and when they do use them, they don't know what they're taking. They don't know what dose they're consuming and so of course they're having bad experiences. That would happen with almost any drug, caffeine included if people just consumed enormous unmeasured doses without having any idea what they were getting into and so they're thrown into schedule one or what happens if 30 years from now, once the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids as being really seriously explored, we find out that that Ambi Food Venica that everyone was saying turned homeless people into zombies in Brooklyn in 2017 turns out to activate a certain subtype of the CB one receptor that's especially useful for Parkinson's disease or something like that. Then we're going to regret having done that. So I think people have to be very careful. Anytime you say anything negative about a drug, you have to be very, very careful because the implications can be enormous. I think that the best stance and all of this is to not speak ill of drug

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       drug. The drugs are true drug enthusiastic, but it's not a problem. Also with just what journalism is. It's like asking a comedian to talk about something but not make fun of it. That's what their job in a certain sense is to get people excited about things. And I don't know whether you'd say the lazy way out or the common approach is to say something that scares people. I mean that's. That's what clickbait is mostly about either outrage or fear. That's true, but there's a lot of richness in truth. I agree, but it's hard to sell. It's hard to settle that rich and hard to sell. I think the people are

Speaker 3:          00:43:42       lazy, you know, is this idea that a lot of people have that, you know, journalism is organized by some malevolent Rupert Murdoch type puppeteer who's telling everyone to. You go off and you say that cannabis causes car accidents. When you go off and you say this evil thing about this and say that again.

Speaker 2:          00:44:00       Alcohol is good. Did you see when a Alex Jones was on my podcast and got high with me when I'm drunk and I. and when it came up in his trial for his divorce, he said that George Soros puts a. He tests marijuana every year to see how much George Soros is influencing the levels of thc was his excuse that people love these ideas. They love the ideas of the, the malevolent

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       puppeteer. Because it denies individual agency, but the reality, and I say this as a journalist who's worked at many different publications, not just vice is, and this is a difficult reality to swallow, is that people are free to say whatever they want. Most of the time journalists choose to report on things this way.

Speaker 2:          00:44:50       It's true, but it's also true that they like. I've been a part of stories that I've talked to the author of it and they said, well, this was manipulated by the editor. The editor manipulated the title, the chain. It's a great excuse the perspective, but it's true. Like the rolling stone did an article about me and they called me as psychedelic warrior and I said to the guy who wrote down, what the fuck is that? I was laughing and he goes, dude, I did not write that. Yeah. The editor gets a hold of it, tries to make it more salacious. It becomes something that's

Speaker 3:          00:45:20       more. It's more likely for people to buy or click. Right. Especially with headlines that that is true and the real problem is that the sort of outrage culture and comment culture that has emerged provides no incentive for truth because suppose someone were to write an article about this conversation we're having right now and it could say Hamilton Morris says Creton should be illegal, or something like that. Then that will get so much more engagement because then you'll have all these people saying, fuck Hamilton. He, he's a, he's a trader. How dare he say that? It should be illegal that it didn't watch it and then you'll have other people arguing with those people saying, well, listen to the interview. Hey, he actually never said anything about that and listened carefully to what you saying and then you create this whole engagement, a bigger engagement for doing the wrong thing. Then you'd get for doing the right thing. True, but. But

Speaker 2:          00:46:10       the initial statement is much stickier. The initial statement of Hamilton Morris is a bad guy because he thinks kratom should be illegal or Katam should be illegal. That is what more people are going to pay attention to. Far less people read the retraction than read the initial worries. This is one of the more insidious things about printing things that are patently untrue, purposely that people do do things that are untrue with the caveat that they could just print a retraction that maybe 30 percent of the people that read the original article, we're going to read that. The initial imprint is what's going to stick with people. Even if you. Someone calls you a rapist, okay, and then it turns out that the person who called you a rapist was lying. The people heard you were a rapist first. They still have that in their head. Oh, he's a rapist rapist, right? It's just, it's very difficult to get slippery ideas out of people's heads. So if somebody writes some articles saying that you're against the legalization of certain drugs and they start looking at you as being compromised, it's the influence that people have today can't be understated because the reach is so powerful. The reach of any article, any video, any. It's so significantly greater than any other sort of distribution of information in the history of human beings. They have the

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       potential for it impacting large groups of people is so huge now. Yes, and this is the result of that is also that the viewers have a lot of power and I think that in some sense they don't quite recognize the nature of that power. It's like voting with your dollar. If you spend all of your time commenting hatefully on things you don't like, you are actively encouraging the production of more of that thing that you don't like. If you like something, you need to engage with what you approve of more because every time you engage with something you dislike, advertisements are sold and it has been incentivized to do that bad thing and that's a really sticky thing when we have this culture where everyone loves to out show their outrage and virtue signal and show that they're on the right side and all this stuff constantly to say, hey, step back.

Speaker 1:          00:48:20       You're just feeding the problem. Yeah. I think there's also a problem with a lot of what people are doing during the day is something they don't want to do. A lot of what people are doing is some job that they don't enjoy and during that job they have freedom to go online and in this state of feeling like shit about what they're doing, they enjoy complaining about stuff and so the they'll read things and type things and get engaged in things and there's some sort of a sport getting pissed off about stuff. Instead of just spending your time doing things you actually enjoy. It seems so simple. It sounds like a simple solution, but if you could figure out a way to actively ignore things that are going to piss you off and seek out things that are going to excite you and intrigue you, you're going to be a healthier, happier person and it doesn't.

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       That is that ultimately what everybody wants. I want to be happier. Don't you want to be happier? Of course, but why do we seek out shit that pisses us off? Because it becomes a sort of addiction. It's drug like in and of itself. I mean, I see it. These arguments, these people are frittering away, finite time on earth, engage in these endless common battles that no one reads and uh, and it's a very dark reality, but it is also something that's driving the current culture of journalism that we're. Truth doesn't matter as much. All that matters is engagement, right? It's just clicks. It's just clicks and money. It's interesting that you were saying something about drugs being inanimate objects and drugs don't actually kill people. It's so funny how drug enthusiast parallel gun enthusiasts with their arguments. It's really the same freedom argument and it's, it's really, I'm in an interesting perspective because I live in New York. I'm like a whatever, just a nerdy guy that doesn't let me guess. You live in Williamsburg. I do a big surprise. So that's where the office, I live close to the office that I work at, but uh, but you know, I have no interest in guns. I'm not, so it's really easy for me to say, well look, there was this shooting and

Speaker 3:          00:50:27       all these people died and uh, and this other guy got shot and these things are really causing a lot of problems. Let's get rid of them because it doesn't impact me and that's where you have to be the most careful because the worst thing you can possibly do is make judgments about how other people should conduct their lives based on your own preferences which people do all the time. So you hear someone say, well, I don't like cannabis. I don't like him. I don't smoke it. Why should it be legal? Because people go to prison for it because it ruins people's lives who aren't your own. And you have to think about people that aren't you. And so it's very difficult when it comes to gun control issues because this, I'm faced with that exact same issue where it would be so easy for me to say, get rid of them all. It doesn't impact me. I don't like guns, but I don't want to fall into that same trap. Yeah, it is a trap

Speaker 2:          00:51:14       and it's, it also sort of highlights how slippery life is in general that these absolutes that we look for, these ones and Zeros, they don't necessarily exist in a lot of subjects. You know, there's, there's a lot of people that have done bad things that have also done great things and that gets weird to, you know, just human beings in general. We're, we're not, we're, we're complex preachers, you know, and to just categorize something as negative or positive, it's, there's a lot of positive things that you could find with drugs. There's a lot of negative things you could find the drugs too, and they, mere human behavior does a lot of positive and negatives and humans

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       behavior. Yes. And back to this, this journalistic issue in the coverage of drugs, I mean, one thing that worries me about the way cannabis and Creton and psychedelics are presented is that it's always couched in their safe. They're therapeutic, they're spiritual, they're historical, but that isn't the point. Even if all those things are true and there's some debate, eventually someone will find a chink in that armor. Someone will die. Maybe they're not, haven't been used as long as you thought they were used. Maybe they don't always work therapeutically, so then what do you go back to? Prohibition? No, that's why I think you need to emphasize cognitive liberty. You need to emphasize people to write, to explore these alternate states of consciousness regardless of whether or not they're therapeutic or safe or traditional or spiritual. The point isn't that it's safe or any of these other things. The point is that if you want to live in a free society, you have to be allowed to take a certain amount of risk. Yeah, that's. That's a big point.

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       That's a very big point and I think it really fits well with your description of the things that people are allowed to do that are legal, that are very dangerous, like race, car driving, bungee jumping, all these things that we just allow them to do. We don't think twice about it using a parachute. All that crazy shit. We just openly and nobody's saying, hey, we should ban skydiving. There was no one saying that. The fucking. A lot of people die. Skydiving, man. I mean, it's fucking dangerous. We don't seem to care. We seem to care about drugs because we think that somehow or another, either our children or someone we know is going to be insidiously infected with these things they're going to get into their lives and, and fuck them up. You know? And I think the real problem with that is education. That's the real problem with that.

Speaker 2:          00:53:43       I was extremely fortunate in a weird way to see someone with a cocaine addiction when I was in high school as a good friend's cousin who got really fucked up on cocaine when he was a couple of years older than me and I watched his life fall apart and I remember thinking when I was little like wow, I don't want to touch that shit. Like cocaine's fucking terrible. And then from then on I've never done cocaine, but it's because of that education because of. And I think real education is something Pitsa fucking tough thing because you don't really just get it from knowing information. You have to see things, you have to talk to people, you have to experience things in your own. Like if someone talks about psychedelics, someone teaches about psychedelics, but they have no experience in actual psychedelic states personally. It's a very hollow conversation. It's like a certain amount of education has to be from real life experience.

Speaker 3:          00:54:37       Oh yeah, absolutely. And the other thing is just again, this idea of pharmacological determinism, like I had a friend that was very, very, very seriously addicted to cocaine and had the resources to do immense quantities every single day. And he'd always say, well, you know, if I try heroin, I know it's all over for me. I know that will be the last straw, so I'm never touching that stuff and he didn't. But my own perspective, you know, I've essentially tried everything and if you really just think about these things you can actually learn. For example, I've tried heroin once, I didn't think. Was that interesting? Did you do it injecting? No, you snort it. I snorted it. Yeah. Yeah. What was it like? It was boring, I think. Boring. Yeah. I don't think opiates are very interesting drugs psychologically. You know, if I were to be totally honest, I think the cannabis is more euphoric and has so few side effects.

Speaker 3:          00:55:32       You know, opioids cause horrible constipation. They cause all kinds of weird sweating problems. I don't think they're especially pleasant drugs, but they're romanticized so much in our culture that people think that's it. Heroin, the ultimate high. Well maybe it isn't. Maybe it's not even that great at all. Maybe it's garbage and it doesn't even matter. That's the same way I feel about snorted cocaine. I don't even think it's a good drug. It's not an issue of it's so addictive. You've got to stay away from it because it's so damn good. It's not good. It's not even an enjoyable high. It has a short duration. It you then feel bad almost immediately afterwards. It's a flawed substance. Same is true of alcohol, I think as well. Alcohol is a crazily flawed molecule. It's terrible. No other drug that I can think of causes a hangover of that type where there's a toxic metabolite that poisons you. The following day, Dr Carl Hart

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       was trying to explain to me what that is and essentially he was saying that when you are getting a hangover, it's your body reacting to the addictive properties of alcohol, that you're getting addicted to alcohol almost almost immediately that your body is compensating for that and then these, this, this, this hangover is not just you being dehydrated, it's also your body withdrawing from alcohol.

Speaker 3:          00:56:50       I would. I am not familiar with any evidence for that. Dr Garcia actually tried to enter in the forum when I first moved to love that guy. Yeah, he. I have a lot of respect for them, but I mean there's a. I'd have to look at is source for that. You'd have to also look at the way I described it because I probably butchered it. Okay, but there's an alternate explanation that's even simpler, which is simply that alcohol is metabolized into chemical assets held to high. That's toxic so and with alcohol, it's a very, very weak drug. By weight, you're consuming insane amounts in terms of the number of molecules you're consuming insane quantities of the drug. So all of this acid aldehyde accumulates in your body and it has a directly toxic effect. Is there a way to counteract that? Mitigate the effects? Yes, there are proposed ways to do it. I haven't experimented with any of them myself because they don't really like alcohol that much to begin with is in a glutathione that's a,

Speaker 2:          00:57:45       that's something that allows your body to process it more easily.

Speaker 3:          00:57:49       It would have to be something that prevents this specific conversion. I don't know off the top of my head. What about Krokodil? You ever fuck with that stuff? Well, this is another perfect example. So you take a drug like Krokodil and it's, it sounds horrible. The Internet's drug the other fear drug, yet people are. But behind every scare story, there's nothing. Explain what that is. So there's a scare story that, I believe it was in Moscow somewhere in Russia in, and this was hitting the news around 2004. No, no, no, much later, 2010, something like that. I don't know. And um, and the idea was that this is the worst stuff. It's ultra addictive. You inject it and then you lose a limb and you have profound necrosis all around the injection site, and this is the worst drug, most addictive drug of all time.

Speaker 3:          00:58:41       Well, the drug itself is called desert morphine and it's been used medicinally. There's nothing especially addictive or dangerous at all that desert morphine. The problem is that people were injecting completely impure reaction mixtures that had all of the components from the synthesis that hadn't been removed, including phosphorus, which is immensely toxic, so you have people basically reporting on ivy phosphorus toxicity as if it were a result of this drug when it's a completely separate issue, and this is what you see when you look at all of these things. It's never the drug, any drug scare story. It's never the drug. You always have to look for the root cause because it's never the drug. There's never been a drug in history and that is why if you look at the dea list of controlled substances, it's not dangerous drugs that are controlled. It's enjoyable drugs.

Speaker 3:          00:59:36       Something like tetrodotoxin the chemical and puffer fish. That's not a controlled substance. There's some regulations in terms of how much you can purchase, but it's not a controlled substance. Sega toxin, the most potent known neurotoxin. It's not a controlled substance. Lead isn't a controlled substance. Mercury isn't a controlled substance. Mercury chloride isn't a controlled substance. All of the deadly poisons. Cyanide isn't a controlled substance. It's not about what's safe and what's dangerous. It's about what people like to use. What's enjoyable, what is the root of that. I think it's, you know, a puritanical idea that, that any sort of euphoria is bad. I mean, euphoria is listed as a side effect in some medications. We assume that it's a bad thing to deal with diarrhea. It's like euphoria. Diarrhea.

Speaker 4:          01:00:26       Yeah. Yeah. That is a strange thing. Like that's gonna. It's gonna, cut back productivity, make you a lazy Ne'er do well and just become a, a burden on society. That's common,

Speaker 3:          01:00:39       common way of describing people use drugs. Sure. And this fundamental idea that sobriety is good. Yes. You know, you look on Instagram, people post a selfie and say six months sober. Guys, thank you so much and tons of congratulations because it's a virtue because you accomplished something. You're not using drugs. Yeah. Whereas in other cultures that would not be the case. People would just say, Oh, you've decided not to work with a a certain medicine. That's an interesting choice. Not An accomplishment.

Speaker 4:          01:01:08       I was saying, was it Kyle Kingsbury there was saying that how much he hates the term plant medicine or was it Dennis?

Speaker 3:          01:01:14       That was kyle. You don't like the term plant medicine, do I don't? Well, Dubai is a. it's a weird sort of pretentious. Yes. Yes. I know. Well, people call Iowasca the medicine or things like that. Yeah. Or towed medicine. I mean, I wouldn't. You don't hate it. I a lot of these, like more flowery terms. Again, theologian, I just don't use them myself, but I don't hate it. Would your,

Speaker 4:          01:01:39       you know, I think people like you are very important and I'm a big fan, but I think one of the reasons why you're important as you are a cognitive center of real drugs like you, you understand what they actually do. You could explain them to the layman or you could debate them with someone who was a doctor perhaps that wanted to, you know, to talk about the dangers of them and you understand all the various aspects of it and I think there's a tremendous amount of ignorance when it comes to drugs, drug consumption. What is a drug? I mean, how many times have you seen a person with a beer in their hand smoking a cigarette saying they don't do drugs. It is so fucking stupid, but it's. It's so common. There is this very, very, very common aspect of being a person which is these desire to change your mental state and we've done it throughout history with various substances, but there's so much stigma attached to it and one of the things I've been doing lately on stage, I'll ask people, how many people get piss tested at work? It's fucking stunning. It's stunning. It's like more than 10 percent of the audience will raise their hand. Like one out of 10 people gets through their body tested to make sure that while they're not working, they're. They're not putting anything in their body. That's prohibited,

Speaker 3:          01:02:56       which is such a horrible invasion of privacy that became so popular that in the eighties during one presidential election, all the candidates voluntarily had their urine tested to prove that they were sober. I mean, this is like truly considered a virtue and it's immensely invasive. I say this as someone who's analyzed my own urine in a laboratory before and it's like a strange portal into your own life that you're showing to a stranger. Everything that you've consumed is then a parent there. Yeah, and it's incredibly. It's a huge invasion of privacy that we've just decided is acceptable and you have to be very careful about these things. Yeah, no, I agree. It's and of course the synthetic cannabinoid epidemic, if you want to call it that, I actually don't want to call it that because I hate even the idea of a drug epidemic, but the popularity of synthetic cannabinoids is largely driven by the fact that they didn't show up on these urine tests, so initially it was in the military than it was people who are on parole or probation. People who were living hard lives wanting to get high, couldn't get high. This was a way that they could do it, and so they've incentivized people that just wanted to smoke weed using completely untested synthetic cannabinoids instead, as a direct result of these urine tests.

Speaker 4:          01:04:11       Well, it's also just a complete misunderstanding that comes to the actual effects and how long they last you. Now you're not even testing a person's conscious state. You're testing whether or not a person has altered their state of consciousness outside of their working time. You know, it's not like you show up and they could scan your hand and realize that you're high on marijuana right now. That's not what they're doing. What they're doing is they're testing you for something that could linger in your body for weeks after the psychoactive effects of long since gone,

Speaker 3:          01:04:43       Oh yeah. Or even be the result of passive exposure. There was a great scientific article that came out a couple of years ago where they found that just passive exposure to cannabis smoke contaminates your hair with thc so that all these people who had hair tests, who actually had not smoked cannabis, but it sounds like an excuse, I was just in the room, someone else is doing it, just being in contact with someone who'd smoked cannabis could then deposit thc in your hair and cause you to test positive so these tests aren't even necessarily reliable. This is the same problem. There was a kind of trend a little while ago, I don't know if you saw about this, where people would get their urine for different to quantify the levels of neurotransmitter metabolites in the urine and this was supposed to be like a fingerprint of your mood, so they'd quantify the level of Serotonin, dopamine, Gaba, whatever, whatever, whatever, and then they'd say, oh, you're a little low on Saratonin. You're pretty depressed. Actually. You need to supplement with some five htp or something like that. It's a very reductive way of thinking about consciousness, but the main issue is that you're not testing in your brain, you're testing or urine and a lot of these neurotransmitters are biosynthesis in the periphery, so just because you have these neurotransmitters in your urine doesn't mean they were ever in your brain. It doesn't say anything about anything,

Speaker 4:          01:05:52       so it's just, it's so juvenile in a way. It's such a. it's such a piss poor way of maintaining order,

Speaker 3:          01:06:03       checking people's

Speaker 4:          01:06:05       consciousness and make immediate. What you should do is judge people based on the productivity. If I have some guy and he shows up work and he kicks ass everyday, I'm like, dude, what's your secret? I get high. Get high before work. It's great. I feel good having a good time at work. Zippity Doo da Zippity Day. I'm putting everything in order and it just feels good. Like keep doing what you're doing. I mean that's how it should be. We should be judged based on whether or not whatever we're doing is. I mean, I guess

Speaker 3:          01:06:35       the real

Speaker 4:          01:06:36       caveat to bed would be people that do speed. Oh yeah. I mean, you get pretty productive for a short period of time doing speed, but I think the downside of that,

Speaker 3:          01:06:48       there's so many people that are on adderall today. Right? What, what are your feelings on that? I think that it's a very interesting issue because it's amazing when you look at the history of all these things, have these issues repeat themselves over and over and over again. So it was a problem in the fifties and it's a problem in the sixties and it's a problem in the seventies. Now it's a problem now. It's always a problem that we're treating as if it were a new thing, but people have been using amphetamines, stimulants for the better part of 100 years. And um, people will now the kind of popular thing to say is, you know, didn't you know, adderall is one carbon atom away from meth. But here's the flip side. Meth is one carbon away from adderall. So this whole idea that math, again, back to pharmacological determinism, that meth is a drug that turns you into a toothless, insane white trash guys stabbing the walls with the cleaver. Looking for people that are hiding and whispering secret messages or something like that, like this is just a stereotype that we have created. Of course there are people like that, but the reality is that these stimulants have an ambiguous potential for all sorts of things. Some people use low doses of methamphetamine, in fact, methamphetamine, a schedule too because to this day it can be and is prescribed as a treatment for Adhd in addition to amphetamine, which is adderall. What do they call it when they prescribe? It does and is the brand name for methamphetamine?

Speaker 3:          01:08:15       Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       adderall is the brand name fettuccine and their vet and I've tried both drugs, both amphetamine and methamphetamine and they're very, very similar drugs. And that's not to say that either are good or bad, it's just a factual statement that if in a double blind placebo controlled or not even placebo control just a double blind trial, I don't think that I could, it could differentiate. It could also help obese patients lose weight. Did you know that? Um, there's a lot of people who think trump is on diet pills. Oh yeah. Yeah. On a diagonal appropriate. Yeah, right. Yeah, and that he used to be on one of the, one of the elements of fen phen phen phen, phen, phen, fenfluramine phentermine. Well, there was a, some journalists that we even talked about the DOJ. We saved this. We have it on a folder now. Would you say, Jamie?

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       I've been hit up messages about that. Journalists, that he might be sketchy, sketchy or something like that, but even if he were on [inaudible] or fenfluramine or phentermine or fen metrazole or any of these substances. So what, you know, the question is, is judgment compromised because he's hopped up on speed, was judgment seems compromised regardless that? Is that why? No, probably not, but it could be why he gets so much shit done. I mean, you remember when during the you, you're, you're, you just don't want to compliment them. And I understand that. No, no, no, that's not why it's again, it's this idea. There's a certain exculpatory value that drugs have. People make the same arguments about Hitler. Hitler, he was just high on speed that explains it. The Nazis, they were just high on speed. That explains it. But what value does it really have?

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       The same thing with Anthony Bordain. They'll say, oh no, drugs were found in his system. Postmortem. So what? What if they had been then what? Well, the idea is that he might have been experiencing a fucked up state of mind because of some drug that made him make a poor choice and take his own life. But you wouldn't know. You wouldn't know why he did it. Is that what you're saying? It wouldn't explain anything really because you still wouldn't know his internal state. It would just be you're projecting an assumption. So what if there were a small amount of heroin in his blood at the time of his death, then you would assume that he had relapsed, was so ashamed of his relapse that he then decided to kill himself. But the reality is we can't make those sorts of assessments. We don't know other people's internal states.

Speaker 1:          01:10:37       We don't even know what these things do to other people. We don't. But we do know that some things like abilify and some other Ssri eyes and even some anti anxiety medication had been strongly linked to suicidal thoughts and in fact there were actually listed as some side effects for a lot of these drugs. Yes. But when you think that. I mean, I know correlation does not equal causation, but don't you think that that's worth considering and it's something to be discussed. It's worth considering, but I would be careful about assigning too much value to it, which is what people tend to do the same thing with columbine. They'll say, oh, he was on that antidepressant. That's why is it? Why does it really explain it? Because a hell of a lot

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       of people that take those same drugs and don't kill all of their classmates. Right, right. For sure.

Speaker 4:          01:11:19       For sure. But it also could be a factor and this is not something that I think we should avoid considering. I think it should be discussed. Yes, I agree with you, but I think we're trying to look at things binary, right? We're looking at things in terms of like on or off black or white. One or zero and I, I just don't think drugs work that way. No, and I think you agree. Yeah. The speed thing is curious to me because one of the side effects of these drugs is impulsive, irrational behavior and extreme confidence in oneself. Like this is, this is right. This is what we always think of people that are hopped up on speed. People that have a coke confidence, you know, confidence is a real phenomenon. When people do cocaine, they feel very confident about themselves and they save ridiculous shit to people. So the question is, is that really what's happening? If they have I gave coke to you, would you start acting irrationally and feeling extremely confident yourself? Or is it just accentuating a problem that already exists in the person's personality?

Speaker 3:          01:12:24       Both. Probably a combination of the two, but the other thing is even if he has been using this stuff for decades, he's probably tolerant to it and it's not. I don't think it would explain his behavior why thing is giving them energy. He's been like this for so long though. This. I mean, this is a long history of this sort of behavior. Well, this was what the journalist that talked about that he had been on this stuff for a long time and that there was a actual Dwayne Reed pharmacy in New York where he described where he got the prescription filled. People were doing the same thing with his finasteride as well though, and I found that particularly obnoxious finasteride is pizza pizza. So they were saying, oh, he's on finasteride and that explains, you know, is a fair or that explains this because it does this or that to your libido. And again, it's like I don't know, or not at all, or let's give him some credit for being a human being with freewill. That makes choices on his own that aren't entirely mediated by what pharmaceuticals he uses.

Speaker 4:          01:13:21       Well, finasteride also has side effects of depression and we went over this yesterday with my friend Ari who was really depressed at one point in time and it coincided with his use of finasteride,

Speaker 3:          01:13:32       right? Yeah. I've seen, but it's not very common. It does occur, but it's not uncommon. Right. But for the person that

Speaker 4:          01:13:41       does get those side effects, saying that it's not common, doesn't really offer any comfort.

Speaker 3:          01:13:47       No, no. Call. Well, I'm one of the lucky ones. I'm one of the lucky ones, ones that jump off a bridge to get my hair to grow back. But you know, the reason that I'm so opinionated about this particular issue is because you see it time and time again. It never stops. You know? I don't know if you're familiar with the Jeffrey Macdonald murder case. No, I'm super fascinating. You probably have read about it and forgotten about it. It was a big thing and maybe 1970, but he was this military doctor, um, who's credentialed. The perfect man. Did everything right, perfect family, everything beautiful. And then one night he goes to sleep and claims that is right after the Manson murders claims that these hippies walk into the house saying, kill the pigs. Acid is groovy, kill the pigs, acid is groovy. And then just brutally massacre his entire family and out of nowhere, out of nowhere.

Speaker 3:          01:14:42       Yes. And um, and it's a long and complicated story, but he went to prison. I don't think that he is guilty, but people had to find an explanation for why and you don't think he's guilty. I don't think he's guilty. He had no motive and there were an investigation was botched and so you think someone came into his house and did that. He was accused of but, but because he had no motive, people had to construct a motive. They had to concoct a reason that this doctor would have murdered his entire family. And so what's a good reason? Oh, amphetamine. He'd been using this, a amphetamine containing diet pills. So that explains it all right. But it doesn't, it's a terrible explanation. People use amphetamine all the time without killing their family. So I just want to be very careful about, you know, do these things play a role in human behavior?

Speaker 3:          01:15:30       Of course they do, but do they determine human behavior? No. That's a very good point. There's a lot of factors. There's just, it's messy. Being a person is missing. It's very complicated. I mean, you're a different person at noon then you are at 7:00 PM, of course. Yeah. I mean, um, it's just, it's so complicated and the more limitations we put on research and the more stigma we put on the use of these things, the more murky these waters are going to be. Yeah, and I think people don't even appreciate the extent to which all these drugs have been made illegal. Of course, everyone's where cannabis is a schedule on LSD, psilocybin, Mtma, but the list is long. It's hundreds and hundreds of chemicals and a lot of these chemicals are chemicals with no supporters, no one's fighting for them. There's a substance called two cn, one of shoguns creations.

Speaker 3:          01:16:27       They just threw it in schedule and no one uses it. If you scour the Internet, I'd be surprised if you could find three reports of people using to cn totally unheard of, but they just throw it in schedule one because why the hell not. No one's going to stand up for it. That's the end of two CN. But they miss a lot of shit too, right? Like they miss five methoxy muscle trip. To me, they missed that. No, that was made illegal in 2011. Right? For 1970 when everything else got thrown into the mix, they made it illegal. I bought that shit. Used to be able to buy it online. Yeah, so did I. Yeah. It was crazy. You could buy a fucking jug of it then get the whole city high buyadol online. Yeah, because it was never popular, so how do they make it illegal?

Speaker 3:          01:17:04       How do they. How do they do that? They don't need any reason. They can simply say that it has abuse potential and make it illegal and if no one opposes it, then it becomes illegal. That's how this list has gotten so long that you have all these people fighting for the legality of cannabis and these other substances that are known to have therapeutic potential, but these other more obscure substances that are really only a concern to scientists who are very seriously disinclined to break the law for the sake of the research. Drug users don't care about breaking the law. Scientists are very unlikely because the whole purpose of science is to publish and you can't publish if you committed a crime in the context of your research, so scientists are dramatically limited by the prohibition of these substances and it's the obscure ones that end up actually making a big difference.

Speaker 3:          01:17:50       Not so much clinically, but in terms of actually understanding the mechanism of these substances, the structure, activity, relationships, the neuropharmacology yeah. The, the stigma on psychedelic use and and even studying them has led so many doctors or scientists, researchers that would be inclined to want to do research on these particular things. They avoid them because it could be incredibly damaging to their careers and it's bureaucratic. I mean there was a group at Columbia that was doing really fascinating research on the drug Ibogaine and Parkinson's disease and the. I was speaking with the head of this study and he was saying how obnoxious it was to have the government common way. His vial of Ibogaine every day and monitors logs and you know, this guy is a really serious researcher. He's not gonna. If you were to get high, he's not going to get high off this tiny supply of government mandated or government sanctioned Ibogaine that was supplied to him, but uh, but they give.

Speaker 3:          01:18:53       These people are really hard time. They make them buy a very expensive safe. They do all this stuff that these are the last people to abuse the substances and they are the ones that are hurt the most severely except for, of course, the people that go to prison, they're the ones that are hurt the most severely. Yeah. It's a crazy thing to think that people are going to recreationally use Ibogaine. That's one of the weirder ones. Oh, it's totally bizarre. Yeah. And I'm. And Ibogaine is a drug with so much potential for those people that are aware of. I began. It's typically only discussed as a drug that treats addiction to opioids, which is very, very important, especially now. But that's the tip of the iceberg with Ibogaine. It has one of the most complex pharmacology's of any drug I've ever studied. There's almost nothing it does not do.

Speaker 3:          01:19:38       I mean it's, you know, you have the Alpha three Beta four nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is also the target of Welbutrin and has a kind of smoking cessation, anti addictive effect. Then you have really high affinity relative to the other receptors for the MMDA receptors, so as academy and type effect and as a classical psychedelic effect of the five ht two a receptor. Then it's a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, Serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It just goes on and then it releases this protein bdnf, which is considered one of the most important proteins in treatment of Parkinson's disease. It's one of the only things that is able to cause a regrowth of dopaminergic neurons and people that have Parkinson's. So this is like really fascinating stuff that's just in schedule one scientists can't work with. It is a tragedy.

Speaker 2:          01:20:22       It is a tragedy and it's also so effective. I know so many people that have gone to Mexico and go into these clinics and done one Ibogaine session for 24 hours and come out of it. A totally different person come out of it with a complete new perspective on even why they were using whatever they were using in the first place in a way that they didn't do. Not only does it help eliminate the addictive properties and the connection that your body has to those substances, but it also allows you to reexamined why you went down that road in the first place.

Speaker 3:          01:20:53       Yeah. Oh yeah. And there was a sort of pharmaceutical push to develop non psychedelic derivatives of Ibogaine that would retain the anti addictive properties, which sounds like a good idea in theory, but so they created this drug called 18 mc and it wasn't psychedelic, but then it also lacked some of these neurotrophic factor releasing properties of Ibogaine. But really the bottom line is that we shouldn't deny the fact that the psychedelic activity of these substances is therapeutic psychotherapeutic in and of itself. You know, I had a friend who was severely, severely addicted to heroin and he traveled to the Netherlands to take Ibogaine and, you know, took the drug, was going into the experience and then started feeling this intense craving for heroin. And um, and started looking through his bags to see if he somehow had forgotten about a little bit of heroin that could just get them through the day. And then he goes into his bag and then finds a small bag of heroin and snorts it. And then it's like, I traveled all the way to the Netherlands to do this. This was, I'm a failure. I'm relapsing after all of this money, all this work. I have no self control. I'm a terrible, terrible person. Why can't I just stop and then realize that the whole thing was a holy nation. There was no heroin. He hallucinated his own relapse. Whoa.

Speaker 3:          01:22:19       Wow. What was your experience with the ivory game? I've never taken high doses. The most I've ever taken is 50 milligrams of this ineffective dose. It really depends. There's sort of move toward microdosing Ibogaine because it actually does have a cardio toxic effect, especially at higher doses. So people are looking into ways of reducing that cardio toxicity by using it at lower doses for longer periods of time. Again, this is something that has to do with prohibition because in a this prohibition market, if you are addicted to heroin, you go to Mexico or you go to Canada and you go to an Ibogaine clinic, you need to get as much bang for your buck as quickly as possible. You're not going to stay there for two months of treatment because most people have lives and can't afford to do that. So do you. Do they give you what, what is called a flood dose?

Speaker 3:          01:23:07       It's a massive dose off, often a multi gram dose of Ibogaine because it's just like a sledge hammer that knocks you down and allows you to get out of it. But is that the best way? That's the fastest way. That's the most appetizing way for someone that had to travel to do it, but is it the best? Probably not because we know that at high doses it has this potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias and that can kill and has killed. So people are now looking at lower doses over longer periods of time. Which would be ideal if it were legal in the United States, I believe.

Speaker 4:          01:23:43       Yeah, that's a, it's a really interesting one. To me it's a, it's a really interesting one because it's got such a long history of use and so many people have had these very good experiences with getting off of addictive drugs from it. Oh yeah. And so relatively unknown as well. It's something that, you know, talk to someone like you and of course you know about it, but I bet if we walk down the street and asked 100 people, I'd be shocked if one of them knew about it.

Speaker 3:          01:24:12       Yeah. And you know, Terence Mckenna would sometimes talk about silicide been as an invention of mushrooms or is technology or as being synthetic and uh, I don't really agree with that idea of an invention of mushrooms where he would sort of say like, this is a synthetic as a coca cola bottle. This is like alien technology. That's how you would describe psilocybin. But in my opinion it's, you know, it's a pretty simple derivative of trip to fan. You just decarboxylated methalate the nitrogen twice and then add this phosphate Ester, but, but Ibogaine, that's a crazy molecule. That's like a three dimensional thing that no medicinal chemists would have ever discovered that if there's, you know, not to sound mystical, but that strikes me as some sort of plant technology. I mean, it's an amazingly complicated structure. It's so complicated that it's almost impossible to synthesize. In fact, it can't be synthesized commercially. All the Ibogaine that people use has to be extracted from plants because that's the only way to get it. Wow.

Speaker 4:          01:25:11       Um, I first found out about it when, when hunter s Thompson accused Ed Muskie of being on it during the presidential, uh, race of, what was it, 1970 or whatever it was. Um, that was a hilarious moment and a lot of people I think were introduced to what Ibogaine was by that when he said a Brazilian, which Dr had been flown in. Of course it doesn't even grow in Brazil, but yeah, it doesn't even make sense. It's also, it was hilarious when he was on the Dick Cavett show and they asked him about spreading those rumors and he's like, well, there was a rumor, uh, that, uh, he was doing this a Ibogaine. And, uh, I know because I started the rumor, I just reported factually, there was a rumor, I mean it's, uh, there's, there's a, a lot

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       of these drugs that get put into various categories and Ibogaine is one of the very few that really isn't in any category in terms of like modern culture, like the way we discuss and consider these things because it's very different structurally and logically. But that the hunter s Thompson story is really interesting because it's obviously a very charming, funny story and I'd have to know exactly when it happened relative to the scheduling of Ibogaine, but that might be an example of how, what's a frivolous joke that most people enjoy told in the wrong climate can result in the loss of a chemical that could be good, that could save tens of thousands of lives and could be a treatment for Parkinson's disease. You know, this is the responsibility that journalists have. It's more responsibility than I think they'd like to have often. But that's the truth. You make a joke about Ibogaine.

Speaker 3:          01:26:52       Next thing you know, it's in schedule one. Maybe he made the joke afterwards, but if he didn't have to wonder because that was one of the first major mentions of Ibogaine in the popular press and the same is true of, you know, there was a rolling stone scare article that came out a while ago and it same deal with this drug to ct seven and they do a whole story, oh, this teenager, he took too much and this to ct seven, it can kill you with just a little pile of powder or whatever. And uh, and then the drug is made schedule one shogun worked on psychedelics. Alexander Shogun, great medicinal chemist who spent his entire life studying psychedelics considered this one of the sixth greatest creations of his entire career squashed by a single stupid story in rolling stone. That's how easily it happens. That was the story.

Speaker 3:          01:27:38       Stupid. I mean, did it have any basis? In fact, an editor at rolling stone told me that there were factual errors in it and there's something weird about it, but yes, people did die because yes, people die from using drugs occasionally to deny that would be to lie, but that doesn't mean that they don't have therapeutic activity and it doesn't mean that they should be illegal. One of the ones that disturbs me the most is fentanyl. Fentanyl, just. I don't even understand why anybody would want to make that. It seems to me that we have no one of opiates as it is. Why make one that's a thousand times stronger than heroin? Yeah. I've known for fentanyl chemists, including the one that introduced fentanyl to the United States initially. He died recently. Did he die from it? No one died of old age. He's killed so many people.

Speaker 3:          01:28:26       Yeah. Tom Petty. David Bowie, Bowie one. I'm not sure. Prince. Yeah. I'm mean. There's quite a few great people that we've lost to this stuff. Yeah, it's really. It's unfortunate, but again, fentanyl is not the problem. The problem is people taking it and the problem is lack of access to safer opioids and lack of education surrounding fentanyl because it doesn't even really have desirable properties. You know, one thing that people always talk about, the potency offense and on one thing that they don't often talk about is the duration. It's a very, very short duration opioid which necessitates compulsive, constant, re dosing. If you're addicted to fentanyl, unless you're doing a transdermal patch or something like that, you typically can't make it through a single night without having to reduce because the duration is so short. That's why it's always done in these prolonged release formulations like a lollipop that you suck or a patch, but anyway, it's.

Speaker 3:          01:29:23       Yeah, it's. It's not a drug that's well suited to street use. It's to the therapeutic index is too narrow. It's duration is too short. It has a medical purpose that it works very well for. It shouldn't be used as a heroine replacement, but the economic reality is that you have to make heroin from opium, opium, s that come from a place where poppies are grown. That's a whole process. Whereas fentanyl can be made by one guy somewhere and the profit margin on the fentanyl is so much greater that there's an enormous economic incentive and the first chemist, this guy that was sort of a friend of mine that died to do it, considered it a good thing to do. That's the complexity that you have to recognize it so easy to say that all of these people are so bad, but often you don't know what's going to happen until it happens.

Speaker 3:          01:30:12       His idea was that one of the major burdens of being addicted to heroin is that you can't afford it. It's really expensive, so by substituting this relatively inexpensive material, the price of heroin would go down. This financial burden associated with opioid addiction would be reduced. It would actually improve the quality of life of the users, and it could even be a more pure, potentially safer material. If you look at certain literature, of course that's not what happened, and many people died and he went to prison as a result of it. Did it really? Yes. Why don't he go to prison for it? Because people died and it was traced back to him. Wow. Yeah, so he wasn't doing this in any sanctioned? No. He was a clandestine chemist. His name was George Marquardt. Weird guy. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. But anyway, you know, you just don't know.

Speaker 3:          01:31:03       You don't know what's going to happen until it happens. You know, of course, the legendary story that heroin was introduced by Bayer as a nonaddictive alternative to morphine. They probably did think that was the case at the beginning, but history has shown that that is not the case. That's one of the problems with introducing any drug to a large population. You simply don't know. It's and it's also one of the things that I find most interesting in and perhaps a silver lining in this whole synthetic cannabinoid narrative that's been playing out over the last decade is you could say, oh, it's terrible. People should just smoke cannabis, but we're learning so much about what cannabinoid receptor agonists can do that we would have never learned if it weren't for the widespread use of synthetic cannabinoids. I mean, just for instance, that it is possible for high potency, so cannabinoid receptor agonist to kill you, that's a big one.

Speaker 3:          01:31:53       We didn't know that until recently that they can be addictive. We didn't know that. What are they using, what is it? It's so. It's an impressively diverse array of chemicals. You know, it started out with a drug called CP 55, 9:40, then it was cp a, what they call it, cannibis cycle of hex and all now and then Jwh jwh 73, jwh 2:10 on and on and on and on. And then it just branched like a giant cannabinoid fractal in every imaginable imaginable direction. And uh, and a lot of these compounds, you know, they, they were patented by various pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer for therapeutic purposes. Again, this wasn't some level and chemist who's cackling and saying, ha ha ha. I figured out the most addictive thing possible. They were just looking to see what's legal, what looks pretty potent and reasonably safe. Okay, we'll make that, we'll sell it.

Speaker 3:          01:32:45       And uh, and I've spoken with the chemists that actually were behind a lot of these operations. Again, not bad guys necessarily, they, they, you know, typically people don't want to hurt other people. You know, genuine, villainous people are pretty rare in my experience. Most people believe that what they're doing has a justification that is good. And again, with the synthetic cannabinoid ideas, one is that although you won't hear this in the popular press and it's rarely said they can be very enjoyable and it would be dishonest to say otherwise, some of them are very euphoric and compare favorably to cannabis and in certain measures might even be superior. That doesn't mean they're safer. It just means that there's something very desirable but them, and if you deny that, then you neglect to understand why people use them in the first place, which is that they make you feel good.

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       So that's part of it. But then the other thing is the urine testing, people wanting to be able to get high without breaking the law, low cost. I mean there's a lot of motivations for doing this and as it played out, people died. People became addicted and random things that no one would have ever expected occurred. We learned, here's another silver lining. I'm sure you're familiar with cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. No, not, you know, this, um, this is our pattern that certain people that smoke all day every day, um, it started showing up in the medical literature about a decade ago. People smoke all day every day and they start getting very, very nauseous and vomiting. And the only thing that can relieve the vomiting is a hot shower. Huh? So really weird. So all these people are showing up in emergency rooms when they run out of hot water.

Speaker 3:          01:34:22       I'm saying like, I need some kind of a, I need some help or something like, I don't know what's going on. The condition resolves itself very rapidly as soon as you stopped smoking cannabis. So it's not hard to treat. You can't smoke weed anymore, but no one knew what caused it and why it was happening now after thousands of years of human cannabis interaction. Why now for the first time in history? And the answer is that people are smoking more weed now than ever before. You know, the levels of thc ingestion with dabbing and high potency strains are just higher for some people, it's much higher than it's ever been in the past. But um, but then the question is, what is causing it? Is it the cannabis itself is a fertilizer, is it a pesticide? What is responsible for this? And it wasn't until people were using synthetic cannabinoids began to experience the same constellation of symptoms that they realized that this is an intrinsic property of certain cannabinoid receptor agonists. So that's something that you can learn from all of this, that it wasn't pesticides and it wasn't some kind of a fungus or something like that girl on the planet, but this is something that happens from prolonged high dose use of cannabinoids. And there's all sorts of other lessons that can be learned.

Speaker 4:          01:35:31       Is that an issue with cannabis use? Pesticides? Have you ever heard of people having real problem with this?

Speaker 3:          01:35:38       It was certainly, you know, paraquat pot. Did you ever hear what's that? Paraquat was, um, you know, in one of many misguided attempts to prevent people from using drugs, they started spraying all of the cannabis. It was grown in Mexico with this ultra toxic herbicide called paraquat and this is a drug that induces Parkinson's disease when you're exposed to it, like really seriously nasty stuff. No joke. And so the idea was if we poison all the cannabis and create this widespread fear that whatever you're smoking might contain paraquat, maybe people will use it less. And Luckily paraquat is a, doesn't have a lot of thermo stability. It's sort of denatured by the heat of smoking. So it's argued that people were not actually exposed to it, who smoked it, but still this is a horrendous thing for the government to have done. They did the same thing during alcohol prohibition by the way they would poison alcohol. I mean that's the extent they'll poison people to prevent them from getting high. But um, that's a reality. But, but now in turn, you know, there's obviously a move toward organic gardening people using, you know, neem oil and things like that. So I wouldn't know. I'll go in. There was, yeah, there was actually a big controversy in Colorado with a pesticide called Mike Club. You tennille I believe that was used. And potentially could release cyanide when smoked. So

Speaker 4:          01:37:05       yes. Yeah. Why would worry about that with large scale production things become commercially viable. The point where someone like rj reynolds gets into the mix and starts growing enormous marijuana plantations.

Speaker 3:          01:37:21       Oh yeah. I mean it's a concern with all the food that we eat as well. Of course. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:37:26       What is interesting to you now? Like is there anything that's coming up or some new thing that people aren't, might not be aware of that might be fascinating to you?

Speaker 3:          01:37:35       Yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm interested in everything. You know, I, I love the history. I love, um, you know, I did a piece in this last season of my tv show or I traced the history of Psychedelic toad venom of five Meo dmt containing toad venom because people have this idea that all psychedelics have been used for thousands of years that every psychedelic an ancient history. But when you look at the history of five Meo DMT, there is no evidence. Really no convincing evidence that I'm aware of. Maybe you can point to a ceramic toad is that evidence that people smoke toad venom? Not In my opinion, it might be some indication that maybe they did, but it's certainly not hard evidence. Even if there were a guy sitting on his back smoking a pipe, it wouldn't be hard evidence. But anyway, so there isn't convincing evidence as far as I'm concerned of ancient toad I'm used.

Speaker 3:          01:38:23       So then the question is, when did it start? Who was the first person to do this? And I, I love these little historical investigations to get to the bottom. Who is the first person to synthesize this drug? What were their intentions? Who's the first person to smoke? Toad venom. And the total volume is a weird one too, because there's this bizarre misconception that you lick the toads. Right? Which again, journalistically produced, maybe it was inspired by cartoons as well to some extent, but I. Yes. So the way you do it is you have to get the tow to excrete whatever this is and you put it on glass and then you dry it out. Is that the idea? That's the idea. Yes. And then you scrape it off with a razor blade and then smoke it. That's it. And does it come, is it a pure form of five Meo DMT?

Speaker 3:          01:39:07       No, and there's actually very little chemical analysis that's been done in the 21st century. I analyzed a sample that I collected when I was in Sonora and it contained in addition to five Meo dmt. It contained some interesting serotonin derivatives including serotonin sulfate and nobody knows how these different tryptamine components as well as these steroidal lactones that are sometimes called bufo talks and contribute to the experience. If I had to guess, probably not that much, but maybe there's a little bit of that sort of entourage effect that you get with almost any plant that has a variety of different alkaloids that might inhibit certain enzymes or do this or that. Um, but it's about 15 percent according to the older literature. The analysis that I did wasn't quantitative, so I don't know exactly what the concentration was, but it's somewhere in that region. And I'm sure it depends on whether the toad has been milked previously and all these other variables.

Speaker 3:          01:40:00       Does the experience mirror taking synthetic five meo dmt? I haven't tried. I've tried synthetic five mud empty a couple times. I've tried boof, all various venom wanted a low dose once at a high dose. There were all different, but then everything is different. Mushrooms are different. Every time I take them, you know, it's, it's really hard once you start explaining a different experience based on the composition of the material because how do you assign it to the dose or the minute number of different tryptamines that are also present. It's really hard to say, but you know, I think that there is a strong argument to be made for using the synthetic as opposed to the pto drive materials simply because you don't have to harm or hurt. Not that it necessarily does harm toads, but you don't even have to risk it and it's easy to synthesize. Yeah, I'm sure it. Toads aren't into getting rubbed on windshields. Yeah. Similar to annoying day for a toad. Yeah. Yeah. They want to eat insects. Yeah. Whatever the fuck they do. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:41:02       one of the more interesting stories out of the last decade or so was, um,

Speaker 3:          01:41:06       this

Speaker 2:          01:41:07       story that I read about these scholars in Jerusalem, that we're connecting the story of Moses in the burning Bush to the Acacia Bush and the case should tree which is rich and dmt and they believe that, you know, when you're talking about a story that was told through oral traditions for who knows how many years and then written down in ancient Hebrew and then transcribed and you know, and translated to Greek and Latin and all these days there's a lot lost in the mix. And they believed that, what that story might have been about of Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with the tablets and having the experience with meeting God in a burning Bush. This is in fact was a dimethyltryptamine experience.

Speaker 3:          01:42:01       Maybe. Yeah. A, it's a big. Maybe it's a big. Maybe I can say that. Um, if you go to the south of Mexico in Chiapas, there's a tree that grows. There is a weed called Mimosa hostility. Maybe you're familiar with it. And this is so abundant that it's used to make fence posts. All the fences on the side of the road are made of most of hostility. It's used as firewood to cook meals. The air smells like dmt because people are using it as fuel all over the place. Not a single person that I spoke with was aware that it with psychoactive. And these are people that are burning it all the time.

Speaker 2:          01:42:39       Do they get high from it? Is there like if you were in a tent or something like that, you were doing a hot box sort of scenario, would you get high from it?

Speaker 3:          01:42:47       No, I saw no. Would you? It may be. It's about two percent dmt so you'd probably have to get so sick from coughing and yeah, it would be a very. I mean even just smoking pure crystal Dmt, it can be very difficult for some people. So my gas not to be like a wet blanket, but my guess is not really. Um, and that's a very strong source. As strong as maybe there's some acacia stronger, but that's certainly comparable. And that's something people are using to cook food all the time and they're not aware that it's like,

Speaker 2:          01:43:22       so was there a way or is there a way for a person living thousands of years ago to somehow or another extract dmt from something like the Acacia Tree?

Speaker 3:          01:43:34       Um, that's actually spent some time thinking about that a while ago. It would be, first of all, depends on how you define extraction. If it were to in like an Iowasca sends like a tea, of course, yes. But then they would need some sort of enzyme inhibitor to create the. If it were to create a, an isolated smokable form again, you know, you could just do it like an aqueous infusion and then try that out and maybe smoke that. But in terms of like a real extraction that would produce crystals of DMT, I don't know what the non polar solvent they would be using to extract a freebase. Would it be like butter or something. And then how would you get rid of the butter? So what is the process like? If you're going to take a tree that's rich and DMT and extract dmt from it, what do you have to use a.

Speaker 3:          01:44:20       have you ever done it before? No, I've never done it. Oh, okay. Well, it's um, it's a very generalizable and simple process that applies to almost everything in chemistry. It's, you know, sometimes it's called an acid base extraction. Most people that are in the dmt community go something they call straight to base and the, you know, the idea is that the side chain of the dmt molecule contains a basic nitrogen that if it's protonated in an acidic solution than it's water soluble and if it's deprotonated than it's only soluble in a non polar solvent. So what you do is you just deprotonated the nitrogen with a base potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide typically, and then treat that aqueous basic solution with a non polar solvent like Nafa and isolate the Nafa, dry it out and you have your material. And that applies to everything. That's not a dmt specific process, but that's what people do.

Speaker 3:          01:45:17       Everything with the basic nitrogen. Now, what's the earliest history of extraction that we will, you know, the first wave of DMT use in the United States was all synthetic. In fact, DMT was discovered synthetically before it was ever found in nature. The same is true of five mg. Odm called. They do that. There was a Canadian chemist named Richard Hellmuth Mansky who, um, I believe was looking at different alkaloids and strawberry plants and he was synthesizing references for these potential strawberry alkaloids and made dmt so he didn't know what he had made other than a potential natural product found in strawberries. And um, and then it wasn't until much later conducted self experiments with injected dmt that people became fully aware of its psychoactivity. And then people started finding it implants. I mean the, the 19 fifties where like, uh, an early sixties were of course a fascinating time in psychedelic research because you have these convergences of these amazing ideas.

Speaker 3:          01:46:13       First you have the discovery of Serotonin, which is like, you know, we take this for granted, now it's in television commercials, but this was of course something that no one knew about it. And suddenly they're finding this in all kinds of different animals. Initially it was in the salivary glands of squid and I'm in different animals. Then they're finding it in the human intestine. Then they're also finding that all of these plants that people worshiped in various indigenous societies also contain serotonin molecules. Then they discover lsd and find that that's maybe the most potent known pharmacological agent at that time. And it binds to serotonin receptors. It activates a Serotonin type response in isolated tissue. So there's like this weird triple convergence of information. Super potent, amazing compound LSD is discovered, Serotonin is discovered and all these different organisms. And there's a pharmacological convergence between the two of them. And then you have all these people worshiping serotonin molecules. So there was, you know, a lot of enthusiasm at that time to figure all this out.

Speaker 4:          01:47:17       So in terms of history, so we're talking about somewhere in the 19 fifties they started extracting tmt. The use of it orally dates back far longer than that because of use of Mao inhibitors and creating Iowasca. But in terms of the first extraction, we can kind of implants to smoke. It might've been even later. It might've been in the eighties. Okay. So the idea that people thousands of years ago, we're able to do something along those lines is probably probably not accurate because because they're talking about a burning Bush. That's why it's appealing to people. Right. The idea of Moses d, do you think that maybe the understanding of synthesis from the synthesizing this from these scholars, maybe they don't have enough of an understanding of chemistry?

Speaker 3:          01:48:07       Well, what would be really interesting is to do an experiment to see what were the materials that were available. How would this have been done? Would you have to use butter as your non polar solvent? How well would that work? What would your butter preparation be done when you put it? Would you take it rectally then? Is that how it would work? I mean you have to kind of. What would your base have been?

Speaker 4:          01:48:27       They were talking about it being something from burning a burning Bush. Maybe it's just one of those things that sort of gets conflated, right? Because you have people today that are very aware that people smoked dmt and have these incredibly intense religious psychedelic experiences, and then maybe they looked at the acacia bushes and said, oh, the acacia bushes rich and DMT. That's probably where the Moses story came from.

Speaker 3:          01:48:51       Right. Well, what's really interesting is, you know, dmt has never been found in the human brain, even though Rick strassman says that it has been. So. A lot of people are constantly assigning altered states of consciousness to Dmt, but we can have these states without dmt. I mean, maybe it's never been found in the human brain, but also there's ethical and experimental issues with sampling fluid from the living human brain.

Speaker 4:          01:49:14       Right, but it has. They have founded in living rats were fairly recently. This is the cottonwood research foundation. That's their. Their. Their attempt is to try to prove that the pineal gland is a source for DMT. We know that DMT exists in the human body. We know that the liver produces it, and we know that the lungs produce it. We're not totally aware of whether or not there's anecdotal evidence that points to the pineal gland

Speaker 3:          01:49:39       based on the rat idea and based on the presence of certain enzymes that could be responsible for it, but even if it is, even if it is, then what, there's still a whole question of how is it released, how is it distributed, what receptors does it activate in? Is it even necessary as an explanation for altered states of consciousness? Because there are other things in the brain other than dmt. DMT has never even been found in the brain, but there are other things, you know, you have endogenous proteins that bind to the kappa opioid receptor, the same receptor that is responsible for the effect of Salvia, um, things like that. They were responsible. I mean, even carbon dioxide itself can induce a pretty strong altered state of consciousness.

Speaker 2:          01:50:21       Right. Which is why people like those psychedelic breathing exercises. Yeah. Sort of. Was it like hypoxic? Is that what it is? What are they doing when they have those? Um, the what, what is it called? There's a type of breathing exercise that induces psychedelic states. Holotropic breathwork. Yeah, and that is the idea behind that, right? It increases the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood.

Speaker 3:          01:50:44       I haven't seen it. A mechanistic explanation. Hm.

Speaker 2:          01:50:48       Yeah. I think that was,

Speaker 3:          01:50:50       but it would, yeah, it would make sense. In an early LSD psychotherapy, one of the things that they would do before giving someone lsts would give them something called carbogen, which was a gas that contains carbon dioxide and they would look at their response to the carbon dioxide inhalation and if it induced a panic response, they would say, maybe you're not psychologically ready for this lsd. That's scary. So that was. You're talking about a test. I mean that was a very primitive early tests that was used by psychiatrists to see if people were had this psychological fortitude to withstand the experience.

Speaker 2:          01:51:23       That's fascinating. So tell me more about whatever is in the brain that mirrors the effects of Salvia.

Speaker 3:          01:51:31       It's a protein. I can't remember off the top of my head. What did you look up? Endogenous ligand for Kappa opioid receptor. It will come up. David Nichols recently wrote a paper that actually goes into alternate mechanisms of how the DMT type a near death experience could be produced by non dmt compounds, but I mean, you know, there was a lot of work also on endogenous and MDA receptor antagonists. There was a a protein that was called Alpha endo psychosis or Angel Dustin named after Angel Dust, but the main researcher died in a car accident, like right as he was making some kind of breakthrough breakthrough supposedly, but I'm q spooky music, but you know, there's all. This has been a longstanding question in psychiatry is you know, what causes psychosis, what causes altered states of consciousness? Is there an endogenous psychedelic? That was one of the major motivations for a lot of this research in the sixties.

Speaker 3:          01:52:33       Finding the endogenous psychotic and that is responsible for schizophrenia. Now it doesn't seem to be the case, but it's still a question that comes up. What if dopamine is methylated in a certain way to create diamonds? Oxy Fin ethylamine or what about this? What about that? I mean, sheldon was very interested in it, but the metabolic production of various psychedelics that account for altered states of consciousness, it just hasn't been supported by evidence in a very strong way, even though people really find the idea compelling and there was also the 5 million dmt and schizophrenia people's crn. That's also a thing, right? And we know that the body does produce five Meo DMT. We just don't know where yet, because again, it's like what I was saying earlier about the depression tests where you look at your urine, so you find five Meo dmt in your urine. And your first assumption might be, okay, there's five immuno DMT in my body. It was in my brain, but you don't know that it could have been biosynthesis in your intestine and it could have been excluded without ever entering your brain. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:53:31       This is the whole idea of monoamine oxidase, right? The idea that when we're eating things that are rich and DMT, monoamine oxidase is breaking it down in the gut. Yeah. So even if you're consuming something. So if something is. So how do they know that this, this, uh, Salvia like substance

Speaker 3:          01:53:51       exists in the mind or in the brain rather because this, this peptide or protein has been isolated. Do you find the name of it? Oh, okay. How I caught four of those words. You said I've lost what I was supposed to be. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:54:09       so we know there's a host of different psychoactive substance are absolutely produced by the body and in, in, in the, in the brain, and that there's different ways that human beings have been able to achieve psychedelic states outside of consuming drugs. Have you

Speaker 3:          01:54:26       done that? I've done lucid dreaming things. I've done Kundalini Yoga

Speaker 4:          01:54:33       and one is the one that I'm most interested in because I have someone who's, a friend of mine that got really into it and he was saying that he can achieve very dmt like state

Speaker 3:          01:54:44       know is a really interesting aspect of all of this that isn't often discussed, which is the ability to have these states and still interact with your environment. Because of course there's something very physically taxing about breath of fire. These Kundalini breathing techniques, if you induce an altered state of consciousness, you need to be focused and you need to be in a specific place sitting down where psychedelics have this amazing ability to allow you to have that experience, but walk around and I think that's not to be underestimated, the walking around because then you can really reexamine your environment. That's a big part of it. For me, a big part of the psychedelic experience is seeing what is New York like, what do I like or not like about New York? What do I like or not like about my apartment? These matters. These things matter. This is your environment.

Speaker 3:          01:55:29       Do you want to be surrounded by clutter that you don't like? If you don't get rid of it? These are the sorts of thoughts you have, and this is my other issue with going to the Peruvian Amazon to have a psychedelic experience because if you do it in this place that is superficially inappropriate, like your apartment, I think it has the most applicability to your own existence in terms of the music you listened to, your friends, your environment, your life, you're confronted by the books that you read, the photos of the people that, you know, all the things that matter to you. Not a jungle, although jungles are very beautiful and visually stimulating and I'm sure and our, I know an amazing place to use psychedelics. Um, I think that we underestimate the value of these things have been integrated into a more normal type of experience and that's something you can't do as easily with a Kundalini.

Speaker 1:          01:56:17       Right, right. That makes sense. So when you're using psychedelics, you will use them and walk around New York City?

Speaker 3:          01:56:25       Yes. What does that look? Um, I often feel a lot of love for. Really? Yeah. Which is, you know, because I think that we also tend to get into these very angry, the subways, knowing guys taking up too much room. I have to stand taking forever. It smells weird, whatever. Everyone is looking at their phones all the time, which is a little bit dark. Um, and then you know, if you're on a low dose of a psychedelic or even a higher one, sometimes I'll look at everyone on their phones and I'll just feel compassion and love and think like what a strange situation we've all gotten ourselves into. I love all these people and it's like, I don't know what to say about it, but I understand that completely and I don't know where we're going from here. And he suddenly feel connected to something that's very real, which is people on the subway not looking at each other anymore. I mean, this is in my own life. Something that has changed dramatically when I moved to New York. No one looked at phones. Now people only look at phones. Everyone is looking at phones the entire time they're on the subway is a total change in human behavior. And you really start thinking about things like that and it matters because it's not in the Amazon, it's your life and these are the things that choices that you make. Are you going to be a person that looks at their phone all day

Speaker 1:          01:57:39       time as well? Yeah. It's fascinating how quickly that took hold. Yeah. If you look at human history, when the iphone is 10 years old, I know that's really when it started, so 10 years ago, people's. And even then in the beginning of the iphone there were fucking useless, right? You know, you get online and it was really slow and terrible and so most of the time we just text messages, but now with all the apps and social media and constant constant updates of information and new things and new events and new trends and it's just. It's always calling you. I'm going to check, make sure everything's done. We've been on this podcast for two hours. Let me see what's going on. I'll look at that. All of these messages here, you did it to me. Actually. I have this vivid memory of standing at your front door and you selling twitter to me saying like, Oh, you've got it. You've got to use twitter. It's amazing. People send all thing you all these articles and it's so useful. You learn so much. It's a really amazing set of only had one tweet at that time and now it's like 2,500

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       tweets later and hundreds of hours of my life. I'll never get it.

Speaker 2:          01:58:45       Sorry. I got Ya. Got Ya. Um, it w, it is that way still for me in many ways. I learn a lot about what's going on in the world and I follow a lot of science tweets, twitter accounts, and a lot of really interesting people that post interesting stuff. But you gotta know how to abandon a tweet. Several words in like, this is bullshit. I'm not reading that. No, I'm not reading that. Oh, what can they do now? Teeth are too long. This is crazy. No, it's not even that. It's just knowing that it's going to be horse shit. This is going to be just either gossip or nonsense or not interesting, but there's still a shit ton of really useful information that you can get out of twitter on a daily basis. There's always something new that's coming out and I try to retweet those things as much as possible.

Speaker 2:          01:59:35       When I see something that someone sends me and then that becomes, people know, hey, if you send joe something really cool and he reads it, if I get a chance to read it, I'll retweet it and people get a kick out of that so they'll send me more cool stuff and so then it's sort of. It's sort of becomes a like a little ecosystem almost for disseminating interesting ideas. Yeah. That's also bullshit too. There's a lot of bullshit in there, a lot, a lot of arguing, which I don't do. I just don't argue. I think it's a very ineffective way to communicate with people, with going back and forth with stuff like that online. It just doesn't work well. It's. And it becomes, I think, more like idea sport with a lot of folks like they're just trying to win these little battles and find the whittier nasty thing to say and it's just, it's not productive. It's not healthy. I don't like it.

Speaker 3:          02:00:26       Well, they're doing the same thing that journalists do, which is that you get more attention for doing the wrong thing than you do for saying the right thing and we all know that feeling where someone says something about you that's unfair and wrong, and you want to say, Hey, wait a second about that. That is totally incorrect. I'm going to set the record straight. And that's what gets the engagement. Not the kind thoughtful, considerate thing that somebody says, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:00:51       yes. I would love to accentuate the trend of kindness. I really think that that is one thing, if there's any one trend and to lean towards kindness to just to just to be nicer to people and if we could all sort of agree that this is a virtue worth pursuing, I think it would change the way human beings interact with each other. These shifts like the shift of looking at your phone, if we could figure out a shift and one of the more disturbing things to me that comes from the left, which I've always associated myself with being a left leaning person that there's a lot of meanness coming from the left now and a lot of lot of by any means necessary. A lot of feeling the need to squash people and humiliate people and insult people because they agree with what you believe and that this.

Speaker 2:          02:01:42       This is a. I think this is a terrible path to go down because then it sort of justifies people who think the opposite of that to be mean to you. So now no one's getting anything done because this side's being insulting and that side's being insulting and people are getting kicked out of restaurants and people are protesting in front of people's houses because they disagree with things and he says a lot of cruelty. A lot of like meanness and cruelty, which is the enemy of discourse. As soon as that stuff gets thrown about and soon as it becomes a war and idea of war or an idea sport, people are just trying to win and the trying to get back at you for what you said and you get back at them for that and it becomes this terrible stall out situation.

Speaker 3:          02:02:23       Yeah, we've all bought into a game and it's a bad game to play. It's the worst possible game and it's very transparent. I mean you look at what shows up on the first page of twitter and it's things that are perfectly designed to generate opinions. So teacher says that now classrooms will be equipped with a bucket of stones to throw at a school shooter and what do you feel? Oh, that's stupid. Or Hey, that's actually kind of a good idea. It's better than nothing and everyone's engaging with it and you're buying into it. You're supporting it and you're promoting it and you're making it bigger by paying attention to it. I mean, there's an amazing book that I recommend anyone listening to this read called amusing ourselves to death by Neil Postman, which he wrote in 1985 before computers, before social media, before any of this. He predicts all of it perfectly without even knowing the faintest hint of what was going to happen and you know his solution if there is one, is you know partially to disengage from all of this, but to try to appreciate long, nuanced, careful things which is very hard to achieve on twitter or

Speaker 2:          02:03:27       television or most places will try our best. Well, I think that's one of the reasons why podcasts like especially ones like this that are these long form conversations are becoming popular because people are hungry for actual communication and they're hungry for people that are just. Even if we disagree on things. I want to know why you think the way you think and I want to hear it all. I want to hear all of your reasoning. I want to hear the thought process that led you to that. I want to hear that and I want to be able to talk to you about how I think and why I think the way I think and maybe we can come to some middle ground or at least understand each other and go, oh, I've seen where you went, or I see why you do. I see what's happening inside your mind or the way you feel or how it relates to your life.

Speaker 2:          02:04:14       This is absent in most discourse on television. It's absent in all talk shows. It's like what we're talking about, the oddness of a panel show. I mean, they're so bizarre. It doesn't make any sense. None of it. It's not how human beings interact with each other. Can you imagine if every conversation you had in your life there was an audience clapping or we'll wing at everything said you'd mean it creates this sort of fake way of communication that has become so commonplace with us. You just. Even the way they sit sitting next to each other like this, like we're not looking at each other. I would be sitting over here and you'd be at the desk and I build, well, Hamilton, funny you bring that up, but you know, look at the crowd. It's just, it's, it's alien. It's really weird and I think because of the fact that people are so addicted to their phones and addicted to media and this constant influx of this loop of information.

Speaker 2:          02:05:13       I mean if you watch the news, they can't just give you the fucking news. You have to get that scroll on the bottom of other shit that you should be freaking out about. It's like the news itself is not enough. No. You have to know about terrorist attacks and fucking Isis and new, some new flu that can't be cured and it's all scrolling on the bottom while you're watching other shit. We was. This is not how human beings are designed. We're designed to talk or designed to communicate with each other person to person. This is what we're good at. This is what we've lost, and the one thing that has probably lead to more people understanding more about each other. Actual conversations is rare, which is really weird. You're, it's way more common for someone to look at their phone for 10 hours a day that it is for someone to have a one-on-one, uninterrupted conversation with someone for an hour.

Speaker 2:          02:06:07       Those don't exist. They don't exist with lovers. That's it. With lovers and occasionally with if you have polite dinner companions that put their phone down and just drink a glass of wine and talk to you about stuff, but even then people suck at it. It's almost like people forgot how to do it. They talk over each other. They don't listen to each other. When the other person's talking, they just waiting their turn and talk. It's a we're. We're going down weird roads that these roads where we're sort of distancing ourselves from compassion and understanding and real communication. Absolutely. I don't know what to do about it either.

Speaker 2:          02:06:48       Psychedelics might help. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. I think they would help. I think if we had like real centers where you could go and just like you could go to a place where you can get a licensed therapist to massage you. You know, hey, I've gotten this back pole and you know, the only thing that works is deep tissue massage. You go to a place, they give you a robe, they played nice music that give you team and they're. They're setting the set and see the setting and the the, the, the ambience of the room, it, it, it enhances the experience of getting the massage. When you go into the room, the lights are down. They might have a candle lit, you know there's some fucking hot rocks in the place and they're playing beautiful harp music in the background. The set and setting is a part of the experience of getting a massage. If we could have something like that and have these things common for the use of psychedelics where you could go to a, a, an actual, some sort of therapist that's trained in both psychotherapy, in the use of psychedelics so they could talk to you and find out if you're stable, ask you questions about your medical history, what kind of medications or you're on it, how you feeling, what are you trying to achieve through this and then work you through. An experience, I think this can be enormously beneficial.

Speaker 3:          02:08:15       I'm sure it already has been. I mean, that's you. We keep talking about psychedelic medicine all the time, but so much of this has been done. That's the really crazy thing. I became used to be a pharmaceutical and France. Although as using lower doses that weren't psychedelic, there used to be an mdms. Are they using it for as like a tonic to stimulate people? It was called Lam, Berean, eight milligram tablets. What is an effective dose threshold psychoactivity in my experiences, about 20 milligrams of the hydrochloride salt, but there were microdosing there. There were many microdosing, microdosing, Ibogaine. They may have used multiple tablets. I don't know if anyone is familiar with French historical literature relating to Ibogaine. I have a little bit of it, but there isn't much. I mean, again, they used to use a psychedelic called Indo pan as an antidepressant and the Soviet Union in the United States, there was a drug called Monet's Alpha. Ethel tryptamine was used as an antidepressant. It's an MDM type, serotonin releaser. And then of course, the whole history of dpt facilitated, um, end of life therapy, lsd, psychotherapy, and on, and on it, everything shoguns group did using two CB MMDA Ibogaine. Um, this was along with Claudio Naranjo in order to facilitate psychotherapy. I mean, people not only were doing it, they were exploring all the different ways to do it, which compounds are best for which applications. Hm.

Speaker 2:          02:09:41       Do you have any experience with cacao? Yes. What is your experience in terms of the psychedelic effects or psychoactive effects?

Speaker 3:          02:09:48       Um, it's mildly stimulating because of the theobromine content.

Speaker 2:          02:09:52       But does it mirror a small dose of Mtma or not? In my experience, no, it was kyle that was talking about that, right? Carl Kingsburg, he was saying that in large doses that rock cow has some sort of a mild mtma like effect.

Speaker 3:          02:10:08       I've heard people say that and people will sometimes say that the presence of fin ethylamine in Cacao could account for that, but it's such a small amount. Race quantity is less than a milligram. And the active dose of Finesse woman is hundreds of kilograms or grams in order to achieve a psychoactive effect. So I think the effect that people do experience is probably mediated by theobromine, which is present in, in a relatively high quantities. That's how the, you know, it's named after the genus Theobroma

Speaker 2:          02:10:37       and theobromine does what, how does it make you feel?

Speaker 3:          02:10:40       It's a, it's a caffeine type stimulant. So when people say that chocolate contains caffeine, what they're really referring to theobromine. And is that why it's deadly to dogs? Yes it is.

Speaker 2:          02:10:52       Huh? So it's theobromine that's doing it. Yup. Fascinating. So it's not actually caffeine. No caffeine like substance. It's less potent than coffee. And what was your experience like physically? How did you feel when you took this? Uh, this Cacao and whatnot? What, how, what, how large dose?

Speaker 3:          02:11:09       I mean I used to eat it every day. What? Raw powders? The powder you did everyday and yogurt and I'm just as a health thing. Yeah, as a health thing. And I liked the flavor of it, but I have never had an experience beyond, at most a low level stimulant experience. And I've also taken pure theobromine and is stimulating, but it requires 500 milligrams to achieve an effect. If I remember correctly,

Speaker 2:          02:11:39       um, what other, what about, um, you ever fuck with nutmeg?

Speaker 3:          02:11:44       Nobody. I mean, it's a fascinating area. Um, of course, you know, prisoners historically did it. Malcolm x did it and the essential oil of nutmeg contains Marista seven, which is a precursor for the psychedelic amphetamine MMDA, not Mtma, but it's methoxy, MDA, and as well as lme sin, which is another psychedelic precursor as well as, um, there's, I think one other maybe even sap role. Actually, I think it's saffron. Lms and Morrison and Shogun had a hypothesis. Again, Shogun was actually by training a biochemist, not an organic chemist, although he spent his career doing organic chemistry. So he was very interested in these ideas with the body creating psychedelics. So he thought when you consume nutmeg oil that your body is, is emanating this double bond and creating a series of different amphetamines and that's what accounts for the high. But in reality people don't actually know. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:12:45       Hmm. So what kind of history of use the does it have in terms of like people taking it for the psychoactive benefits?

Speaker 3:          02:12:54       I'm sure there is some ancient. You or I would be, I would assume there is some ancient use of it, but um, you know, it's mostly like a thing for teenagers and people in prison these days. It's kind of, it's illegal high. It's one of these things that you do when you don't have access to, to anything else and most of the reports make it sound more like an anticholinergic delirium type experience. More like taking a lot of drama mean then that like a classical psychedelic experience, but you can use that oil to make a lot of psychedelics in a laboratory. Wow.

Speaker 2:          02:13:27       Now, history of use as well also, so fascinating me when you talk about

Speaker 4:          02:13:32       history of use because um, there are certain cultures that really don't have a written history. They have oral history. So it's very difficult to determine when people started.

Speaker 3:          02:13:42       What about

Speaker 4:          02:13:43       pod? What is the history of use of peo? Because I remember reading something that kind of stunned me that said that there's only like a couple hundred years have known use of pod.

Speaker 3:          02:13:54       Yeah. Well, okay. So there's different histories because pot is used, it grows naturally over a relatively broad region. Stretching from the southern United States into, I believe mostly northern Mexico. And so in the United States, the history is about 100 years old of the native American church is its recent. Um, but that's crazy. So 19, 18, something like that. Yes. It was a, uh, a comanche chief named Quanah Parker, um, who spread the pod religion across the United States and it caught on because it's fantastic. Of course it caught on. I've never experienced it. What is it like, um, well again, it's another one of these plants that has masculine of course, but then it has these other accessory alkaloids that modulate the experience. So what's really interesting about pod is it contains this chemical called peo teen and Payoti and I have some, uh, pharmacy trade journals from like 1890 or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:14:57       Know maybe it must be later than that. It must be maybe like 1915 or something like that sometime around there. And they talk about like, your pharmacy must have morphine, cocaine and peo team, the three substances every pharmacist needs and uh, and pot. And was used as a hypnotic. It was used to induce sleep, but there's been no very little research on it. None of the 21st century. I mean, this is like a, it was once considered a really valuable medicine. The issues that it's a little bit tricky to synthesize and it has to be extracted from this rare cactus Luftwaffe for a diffuser. But, um, but that modulates the experience. You have so many different alkaloids and um, and it, it's very long lasting. It causes dramatic pupil dilation. It's extremely nauseated and bomb. I made an episode about pod in the most recent season of my show, um, and I vomited so much that my nose started bleeding.

Speaker 3:          02:15:54       Um, you know, it was some serious vomiting and it's physically very, very punishing, more so than almost anything I've ever done. I would in terms of the aftereffects or while you're doing it while you're doing it, it's a heavy load on the body. So it's. People always say this is not recreational or whatever, but it's truly as NC, you know, this is really, um, a punishing experience. And on top of that, the native American ceremonies often accentuate some of those punishing aspects of it, like water is conserved. You don't get to drink as much water as you want to emphasize the importance of water in Mazda Tech, Salvia ceremonies, there's no water at all, which I think is actually increases the absorption of the leaf into your mouth because the natural reaction when you eat something disgusting is to wash it down with water. These are little things that people do impulsively without thinking that are going to change the nature of the experience.

Speaker 3:          02:16:50       So anyway, you eat this cactus, it's incredibly nauseated and bitter. And then you have maybe a 12 hour, um, hallucinatory euphoric state that's very beautiful and strange. But you see the cactus raw. Yeah. Some people grind it, some people cook it. So you could get that shit at home depot, you can get San Pedro at home depot. No, no pod is a dumpling cactus. It's a very small, um, somewhat spherincel cactus that produces beautiful white and pink flowers. And it's incredibly slow growing, which is why the conservation of Pod is an even bigger issue in the conservation of toads pod. All these psychedelic plants have major conservation issues that need to be addressed, but pod is arguably the biggest of them all because this is a slow growing plant. If you want to learn patience, grow pot, that is how you learn. I mean, this, this bottle cap, I mean, it takes five years before it's the size of a dime if you grow it from seed.

Speaker 3:          02:17:50       So when you're eating something that's, you know, um, that's as big as the room of a coffee mug or something like that might be 20, 30 years old Jesus Christ. So there's a lot of history in these plants. They call them grandfather pod. And I think the reason is that by the time that they're ready to be consumed, they often, our grandfathers or grandmothers, they have produce seeds and have offspring and all of this stuff because it takes that long. Um, so yes, it's very slow growing. It's not a sustainable practice the way that it's being done. But there's also even bigger threats to the environment in the form of root plowing, all the territory to build walmarts and subdivisions and different things in south Texas because most of that land is privately owned and um, and it's difficult because there's a belief in the native American church that has to be an outdoor natural grown.

Speaker 3:          02:18:48       It can't be a greenhouse cultivated plant the because part of the potency and the value is from his interaction with nature. So it's, it's if it's sustainably harvested, where only the crown of the cactus is removed, but this long carrot like taproot is left in the soil. It can regenerate new heads. But if people don't have proper harvesting techniques, it can decimate the population very quickly, especially because it's not a very potent substance. Requires many of these ultra, ultra, ultra slow growing plants. Wow. So what is the natural territory of it? How wide is the natural territory of these plants? I can't tell you exactly, but it's not very large. So if it got very popular, that'd be a real problem yet it probably won't. I mean, you know, the people that care most about it outside of the native American church are interestingly cactus files and Thailand and Japan who grow it for purely aesthetic purposes because it's so beautiful.

Speaker 3:          02:19:47       They and they would never even consider it because to them it's this prized ornamental plant that produces amazing fruit and flowers and lives seemingly forever. And if you take care of it, it can just look amazing. So, um, those, there's a huge pod scene in Thailand of people that never would dream of consuming it, that just grow it ornamental. Wow. Now San Pedro Cactus, does that have psychoactive properties? Absolutely, yes. And did you have to extract it in a different way? I'm like, God, it can be consumed raw. Um, the, with some varieties of San Pedro, they actually contain comparable quantities of masculine to pod and it's a much more sustainable source of masculine for that reason. And Crows, unlike pod, it grows very, very quickly and um, and can be propagated by cutting easily and it, you know, it's much easier to work with. Um, but traditionally if you go to Peru, they'll take a length of the cactus and they'll cut it like a loaf of bread into slices.

Speaker 3:          02:20:47       Then they boil the slices and create a sort of low potency aqueous infusion that they drink. And what's interesting about the way they do it is that it seems that it's almost designed to create a lower potency drink the way they do it. They drink every night, the Shamans, every night of their entire life. And many people come back and do it repeatedly. And for them it's sort of, it's like a traditional form of microdosing you could say. It's not about blasting herself into the cosmos the way people do when they smoke. DMT. This is about fortifying your body, giving yourself strength, cleansing yourself, balancing yourself and other people that consume it as well. Not that I saw there. No. Hmm. Oh, but people do. What people do I have. And what is the effect? Is it comparable to the pod effect? It's comparable, but it's, yeah, it's comparable, but again, it gets very hard because of these variations with natural products in terms of the potency of the cactus and that point in your life and you know, people will always come up to me and say, what's the deal with Mtma? It used to be like this and now it's like this. What accounts for that? And it's like, well, don't underestimate your own changes over time. When I was 21, I could drink alcohol, not that I did very often, but I could and not want to kill myself the next day. Now if I try to drink more than three drinks, I'm going to feel horrible the next day. Like just emotionally ruined. And that's me, not alcohol. Now you brought up the term a hypnotic and which made me reminded,

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       reminded me of our conversation that we had through email about Roseanne Barr. Oh yeah. Oh yes, of course. Yes. And about Ambien and about the effects of Ambien. She came on the show. She still hasn't. She can't. She's having a really hard time with this. Um, she feels terrible about what she said. She feels like the whole world hates her. She feels like she's lost everything and her life is destroyed and she's distraught and she, she was going to fly out here, but we had a conversation and we kind of decided to be probably better if she waited, just let, let some of this

Speaker 2:          02:23:07       pass by. It's still in the news because they've decided to move the show on without her there. They're going to kill her off or something. Yeah. And she's just devastated and uh, you know, she was also devastated health wise. Physically she's an older woman and not that it'd be any different. She was an older man. She's an older person and this grueling schedule of doing a television show was horrible on her. It just, it was really, really tough to do. She got bronchitis. She felt like she was almost dying. She was completely exhausted and she felt like the schedule of it all just was just way too taxing on her physically. Then on top of that, she's on a host of different things. She's, I mean, she'll ever do wind up sitting down and talking on the podcast. I'll get her to, to list the various thing she's on, but she's on various antidepressants.

Speaker 2:          02:24:03       She changes them up, mixes them mob. She was one of the things she said to me, she's, she needs to get her doses readjusted. She drinks alcohol regularly, she smokes marijuana regularly. She's also an Ambien, regularly takes it every night to go to sleep. And I tried to explain to her the fact that you're not getting real sleep when you're on that this is not something you should take and rely on on a daily basis. They even tell you to get off of it. I mean, it's, it's, and it's difficult to get off of it. Um, but people want to dismiss the idea that she could have said something that's completely out of character or done something that's completely out of character while under the influence of this stuff that it could have contributed to that. They want to dismiss it because they want a villain they want, oh no, she's bad. They want this, like this childlike simplistic reasoning and rationalization. For what she's done,

Speaker 3:          02:25:00       right, and this is, you know, prime example of this sort of schizophrenia nature of the way drugs are depicted in our society. If it's, if it's something like bath salts or k two, they're responsible for everything. One toke of that stuff and you're eating your best friend's face under a bridge, but then in case they have no explanation whatsoever, no exculpatory value, they can't be used to explain anything. Is it an excuse? No. Is it an explanation? I think yes. I think that intoxication can explain all sorts of inappropriate behavior and to pretend otherwise is. Again, dishonest. I know am Sanofi the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ambien had this widely shared tweet saying that racism isn't a side effect of Ambien, but it's a little bit ridiculous for them to have done that. You know, especially to someone who's mentally ill because, you know, if you look at the medical literature, the fact of the matter is that ambient is associated with all sorts of absurd behaviors.

Speaker 3:          02:26:06       Command hallucinations where people stab themselves, jump out windows, people that you know, butter their cigarettes and smoke them. People that paint their houses in the middle of the night with no memory whatsoever, and it's a profoundly, profoundly disinhibiting drug. So, you know, here, here's maybe a somewhat analogous example from my own life. I never take ambien on planes for this reason because I'm around strangers. I don't know what I'm going to say or what I'm going to do, let alone use twitter, but I don't. It's uncomfortable because it's so disinhibiting. I might do something weird. I don't know. Take off my shirt. I have no idea. You who's to predict what you're going to do when you have no inhibitions whatsoever. So I remember once I was on the plane to Berlin and I did take ambien and I start in this sort of delusional state thinking that the cabin crew and the person that's announcing over the entercom is saying various Nazi things.

Speaker 3:          02:26:59       That's like an unfair stereotype that all Germans are Nazis that's offensive, but I had no control over this. Just because they're German talking in German doesn't mean that this is like a Nazi airship because you're just completely out of your mind. Wow. But again, I mean, like another story, um, I used to be friends with a girl whose dad was a psychiatrist, prescribes her immense quantities of Ambien and um, she would snort it. There's no reason to start it. It's water soluble. It has a fast onset of action. There's no benefit and snorting it, it's fine orally if you're going to take it at all. And there's no reason to take high doses. It's already a delirium at the therapeutic dose. You don't need to take more, even five milligrams induces delirium. But, um, but I remember I was at some party and someone was saying that they wanted ketamine, did anyone at the party of ketamine and just a complete stranger.

Speaker 3:          02:27:53       And I said, Oh, I actually have a little bit of ketamine but it's at my apartment, here are the keys and here's my address and just run over to my apartment and, and help yourself talk to you later. And uh, and then, um, I, I'm one of these people, I've never lost my phone, never lost my keys. I don't lose things. So then I, you know, wake up the next morning, go to my apartment, reached into my pocket, my keys are gone, and then it hits me this flash of, oh my God, I gave my keys away to a complete stranger to go to my apartment and take ketamine from me. What on earth was I thinking? What? Like what level of disinhibition is required to do something that insane. Luckily I was there. I had to spend the rest of the day tracing, finding out who that person was getting my keys and these people happen to be very courteous people and actually did go to my apartment, did take the small amount of ketamine that I had and then just lock the door after themselves and didn't make a mess.

Speaker 3:          02:28:47       But again, I mean this is like, this is a profoundly disinhibiting substance. And also I think the idea that a drug couldn't modulate racist activities. Interesting as well because there's a study that you can look up where they use the Beta blocker, propranolol and they found that it actually seems to block racial implicit racial bias in people in certain tests that what they're suggesting is that there's an address, energetic component to implicit racial bias, but there's a certain maybe heart rate or fear response and once the physiologically blocked you become less racist in a sense implicitly. It's not a conscious decision. Conscious racism isn't reduced, but an implicit racial bias is. I mean these are like really complicated higher level questions about how drugs impact cognitive functioning and um, and the bottom line I think is be careful being certain about anything about what drugs can or can't do.

Speaker 4:          02:29:50       What does this Jamie. Oh, this is the story. Blood pressure drug reduces inbuilt. What does that word in built? Racism. Common heart disease drug may have an unusual side effect of combating racism. Wasn't that a fucking. There was that stupid movie with Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt is good as it gets. He was a racist and they gave him a pill. They gave him some medication and it reduced racism. It stopped him from being racist. Whoa. I completely forgot about. I remember it because I was angry because a bunch of people from the the. I was working on television show at the time. A bunch of people were talking about how great a movie it was because it was this weird dark sort of film and I was like, that movie fucking sucked. It was so depressing. Here. This woman, she's got a. she's a waitress and Jack Nicholson is this old racist asshole and she's relying on him for some real reason because you can't find anyone who's nice to her and and he's racist, but the, the, the resolve of the film was that he just was sick and they gave him some medication. He wasn't racing anymore. I'm like, get the fuck out of here. That doesn't make any sense. Meanwhile, maybe it does.

Speaker 3:          02:31:02       I mean, ambient is an amazing, amazing substance. I made a piece about it called the ambient effect years ago. I don't know if you're familiar. They're people who are paralyzed who can take ambien and start walking again. It has the power to regenerate regions of the to regenerate activity in regions of the brain that looked dead on Fmr. Try

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       it is a wacky drug. It's also chemically very similar to five methyl dmt. It's, it's not, it's not like a benzodiazepine like valium. It has its own bizarre structure. I mean, it's a weird drug. So when these people are paralyzed by the paralyzed, like what? What is wrong with the strokes? Traumatic brain injury, various reasons. There's a book about it called hope and brain damage. I believe the title of it is an Ambien somehow or another temporarily fixes it. Yes. Temper only for the duration of the drug effects. So those people that are in a persistent vegetative state, they take ambien and suddenly they wake up. What the fuck? Yes. Yeah. It's pretty. It's well documented and it's a really bizarre effect that is exclusively present in ambient and maybe slightly and um, Baclifin as well. Yeah. I thought that the statement that the pharmaceutical company made about a racism not being a side effect was kind of cute.

Speaker 1:          02:32:21       It's kind of witty. It was a very snarky. Yes. But the problem with that shit is, well, what are the side effects? And then you go into the actual side effects and like, Holy Shit, how is this legal? And then you go into the side effects of like, what is this doing to people like, well here's another one. It supposedly increases consolidation of negative memories. Whoa. Yeah. There's a lot of weird stuff. Negative memory increases. Consolidation of negative memories causes a just total hallucinatory insanity at higher doses. Maybe the most powerful disinhibiting agent I'm aware of and is able to restore cognitive and motor functioning and people with traumatic brain injuries. What a weird drug. Very weird. And not not something people should be taking every day. Just not. It's certainly addictive. I mean it binds to, even though it's not a benzodiazepine itself, it binds to the benzodiazepine site on the Gaba a receptor. But yes, no, it's addictive. It's super addictive. So for that reason alone, people shouldn't be taking it every day because you'll become horrendously dependent on it. And withdrawal is ruthless. The etsy, the withdrawal is total insomnia.

Speaker 1:          02:33:36       So most people just go right back to it or you know, you can then track, like you can transition onto different types of hypnotics, like taking an anticholinergic, like Benadryl to sleep or cannabinoids cannabis, things like that, or um, you know, just things that don't buy into the Gaba a receptor in order to try to reduce tolerance. There's ways around it. You're not doomed if you start taking it, but it's, it's certainly, um, habit forming and something that's best to avoid if you don't require it and it doesn't give you real sleep. Correct. I mean, you're, you're missing some part of the sleep cycle with Dr Matthew Walker was on, here's a sleep specialist and he went into depth about it, but I really don't remember his exact description, but he was talking about how it bypasses certain cycles and you're, you're not getting a real night's sleep.

Speaker 1:          02:34:23       I am not aware of that. I mean, there's, wouldn't surprise me hugely. You know, there's still debate about what the most restful part of sleep is. Um, I think most literature points to actually non rem sleep, slow wave sleep being the most restful type. And that's actually supported or promoted by chemicals like Musk Amal from the m and e to miscarry a mushroom that, that in, and there was one pharmaceutical derivative called gearbox at all that I did an episode about on the most recent season of my show. And that really does produce incredibly restful sleep that is superior to ambient. But like ambient, it was also psychedelic, even more psychedelic probably. So this is an issue. It seems it for whatever reason, a lot of these drugs that really promote sleep effectively also happened to be hallucinogenic and nobody knows exactly why, but it's been a pharmaceutical barrier because we don't live in a culture that allows people to go nuts at night.

Speaker 1:          02:35:25       Yeah, no kidding. I'm glad you brought up the mud to miscarrying because that's another one. Um, that is, uh, almost like a drug of lore more than a drug of application. You don't really hear too much about people getting real good experiences. No you don't. But it's also connected to a sacred mushroom and the cross, the cover of it from John, mark or allegro has an emmy nominated Mascara. He thought that the emanated Ms Dot Garcia was probably linked to psychedelic states and pre historic Christianity. We, we don't know. Right. Oh, he's such a salacious wacky guy. Mazy oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, he, he was getting off on it. He loved it. He will love getting off on freaking people out. Freaking out. Christian. That was a. You can't underestimate what he was saying. He was saying all of Christianity is a sex cult that worships a fungal Phallus and the semen of that Phallus or the spores.

Speaker 1:          02:36:29       Yeah. Then all of Christianity is an ancient fertility called. That's a big claim from a serious Oxford educated Dead Sea scrolls scholar who is respected up until that point. Yeah. Who was also an ordained minister. Yeah. I mean there's a great book called shroom that argues that this was all, some kind of cynical attack on the Christian religion and that, uh, he didn't even believe it himself. I'm. The issue is that in order to carefully examine his claims, you need to speak what is it? Ancient Aramaic or something. So it's like, it doesn't, I'm not in a position reading his book, which is all having to do with the etymology of these words, their origins in different languages. I just don't know enough about these ancient languages to make a, an informed assessment

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       of his claims. But uh, which is I think one reason that they've kind of hung around in this lower for such a long time because it's hard for people to say with certainty, um, if they're true or not. Although I leaned to them for them probably not being well supported.

Speaker 4:          02:37:36       They pause. Why is that?

Speaker 3:          02:37:39       Um, just seems to be wacky. Yeah. Because they're not. I haven't seen them integrated into any serious work since I'm not that that's necessarily a good argument. Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:37:49       To take on a lot of education to be able to even understand whether or not that debate is

Speaker 3:          02:37:57       cogent. Right, right. It's the same deal. I encountered this sometimes on really fringe aspects of physics and chemistry where someone will make some kind of wacky argument about the way atoms bond or something like that. And it's like, it gets hard because you only have like a small handful of people that are capable of seriously evaluating the claims, able to weigh in and then it doesn't really get vetted in a serious way. So things just linger around is, maybe it's true, maybe it's not, but um, but the bottom line is that most people don't get it a valuable experience from these mushrooms, but some do, some people have figured out how to make it work and the experiences, again, it's, you know, it's its own thing. It's a gabaergic delirium to takes you into a dreamy drunk zone.

Speaker 4:          02:38:42       Yeah. And it's, it's in many ways a toxin, right? It's toxic in some forums.

Speaker 3:          02:38:48       Well, it contains a, another chemical in botanic acid that is potentially very toxic, although it hasn't really been examined. In fact, it also contains a complex of this element vanadium that could potentially be toxic as well. So there are some legitimate toxicity concerns that I think anyone who's consuming it should be aware of. Um, you know, the ideal situation would be isolated Moscow mall, but it's hard to extract. Hm.

Speaker 4:          02:39:13       And but yet it's connected in so much artwork and so, so much ancient depictions of particularly of Christmas cards. There's always elves and these little laminated miscarried caps.

Speaker 3:          02:39:27       Right. Well, drugs aside, you have to acknowledge that it's a spectacularly beautiful mushrooms if you. I've gotten mushroom hunting all over the world and there is no question that when you see that mushroom in habitat that it's

Speaker 4:          02:39:42       completely spectacular. There's nothing else like it. It is magical experience. Just looking at it. Yeah. I ran across it only once in Colorado in the woods and it was amazing. It's like this big. It was a big one too, is this big, beautiful red with white dots on it. It's like one of the most gorgeous things you could ever see growing.

Speaker 3:          02:39:59       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:40:00       yeah. Yeah. And it's legal. It's legal to possess again. Yes. It's legal because it's not really do anything enjoyable for most people, but is it possible that we just are doing it wrong and that the, the information

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       has been lost as to how to. Because a lot of people felt like it might've been a part of Soma, which hasn't really been defined as to what Soma is,

Speaker 3:          02:40:22       right? We had those debates are not really my, uh, my cup of tea, right. It's like just tons of guys pushing this or that argument without like a lot of evidence one way or the other. And so I don't know. And then there's people that argue that urine drinking is somehow required to concentrate the muskeg mall in one way or another. Um, you know, if you want to learn about it, I think the best way to do it is actually through this other related drug. Got Box at all, which was, um, almost developed by merck as a competitor for Ambien. And there's some high dose reports of gearbox and all that gives you a much clearer example. And from my own experience as well, of what the potential of that class is. And it's very different. It's every bit as powerful as Iowasca or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:41:10       But completely different. And it's hard to articulate. All these things are hard to articulate, but it's something that's been experienced by relatively few people so that you don't even have this a spiritual or metaphorical vocabulary for it. The way that I hadn't most powerfully was once I was doing a shoot for vice on Hbo and they told me I had to go to Tokyo with less than 24 hours notice and that I had to start filming as soon as the plane landed, couldn't go to the hotel room. So I thought, all right, this is serious. No messing around. No time for jet lag. Like I've got to fall asleep at 10:00 PM that night. Wake up at 8:00 AM that morning. I've got to be awake all day, so I'm in a pharmacologically forced this a little bit. I'm going to take a really high dose of this mosquito old derivative at night to induce sleep and I'll take adderall during the day.

Speaker 3:          02:41:57       That was the plan, so I took a high dose, I believe it was 45 milligrams, but don't quote me on that. Of this musket mule derivative. It's about the same potency and I'm at the equivalent of what would have been maybe 2:00 PM New York time, which I think was crucial because these things are hypnotic. They induce sleep. So if you take it during the day, you're less likely to sleep through the whole experience. And it was unbelievable. I mean, I, I, uh, I couldn't fathom the intensity of what I experienced. It was, you know, just this rushing sense of, of becoming a passive observer in my own consciousness and seeing all of my thoughts produced by someone else that we're racing at a speed that was so fast that I found it physically dizzying and had to lay down. And I felt as if like the acceleration was pushing me toward an ultimate state that was sleep and that sleep in death represented the ultimate state of consciousness. Whoa. So it was, it was, and then, you know, then I had to wake up at eight and work the next day and people say, how'd you sleep? And it's like, well, I actually had this, uh, a transformative existential trip accidentally.

Speaker 3:          02:43:15       But you tried it since? Just purposely for, I mean a couple of times. Yeah. Did you ever recreate that kind of experience? No, because it was, it was a bit much I would say, and I know people that have taken even more and it turns into just your entire visual field, a transforming into rotating cubes where each face of the cube represents a different aspect of your life, your future, your past, your present, you know, really dramatic stuff. So I think that potential exists with high dose Moscow mule. It's hard for people to ingest it because of all the other material in the mushroom and the disgustingness of consuming it.

Speaker 2:          02:43:53       So is it possible that we've just much like people have sort of a altered many different things like we and tomatoes and what have you that at one point in time the mushrooms somehow different?

Speaker 3:          02:44:08       Oh yeah. Well yes, absolutely. Yeah. I mean the, the evolutionary chemical history of all these different plants is a fascinating subject that's pretty much lost to history. You know, there's no like, archeological alkaloid analysis that I'm aware of, but it would be so fascinating to know because all of these natural products evolve, just like the plants that contain them. What were the intermediate materials? What drugs have gone extinct have, did our ancestors drive certain psychoactive plants to extinction? There's a plant called psyllium that some people have argued that may have happened with those, a fennel derivative, um, or like a fennel related plant. But, um, yeah, I mean it's, it's really, and it, we've seen it with cannabis, you know, the black market encouraged everyone to produce thc dominant strains because it was the most potent, most stoning, most bang for your buck. Now, now we have the ability to change the evolutionary direction of the plant and to encourage the production of CBN or CBG or Hcv or cbd or whatever. Hm. So

Speaker 2:          02:45:17       when you talk about a plant like the pod cactus that grows so incredibly slow and you know, if, if that became something that was highly sought after, very, very valuable, it could conceivably be wiped out. Yes. Yeah. Especially something really. So I'm so there could have been substances like that, that we're very geographically local, that very small area that are just gone.

Speaker 3:          02:45:45       Yeah. It's just a thought. I just had totally done evidence based, but wouldn't it be crazy if a lot of the reason that a lot of these, um, psychoactive plants that are present today tend to be less addictive is because all the addictive ones were harvested to extinction thousands of years ago. Maybe something like that. I mean, these things do happen if you didn't have know. We really wouldn't have any way of knowing, but if there fossilized plants, right, right. It certainly didn't happen with coca, which contains cocaine or cat. So it probably didn't happen that way, but you know, you just don't know. Yeah. And I had read some theories that it's

Speaker 2:          02:46:24       conceivable that the emoney to miscarry a very seasonably uh, so you have to figure out like when is the right time to harvest? Because there are some plans. Although of course fungus isn't really a plant, it's kind of the opposite of a plan that way. And ingest oxygen, it takes in carbon, it takes an oxygen. And breathe out carbon dioxide like a, like an animal does, but that it's possible that these things vary seasonably, that you have to catch them within a window of time and that they also vary geographically. Like some places they might be more potent, like, you know, Cuban cigars, grown on specific land, have a distinct,

Speaker 3:          02:47:02       probably more a more potent taste to them. Oh yeah, absolutely. Because the biosynthetic precursors for all of these natural products come from the soil. Typically, you know, amino acids and things like that, and it's all going to change. There was an amazing experiment that was done where they started doping the substrate of psilocybin containing mushrooms with other tryptamines, so they used, instead of the DDT and dip tea, put it in the substrate and they found that the mushroom would take that completely synthetic chemical that does not occur in nature. It would then four hydroxylase indole ring just like it were a silicon derivative and create natural product derivatives of these synthetic materials. Creating these semi-synthetic hybrids between men and mushroom creations. Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. I mean this is like why the synthetic, natural dichotomy doesn't make sense. Everything's evolving, it's a constant interplay between human and plants and fungus, you know, after we're all gone, all of our plastic bottles are going to be consumed by some bacterium that evolves to degrade all of these, you know, polymers and that will create natural products from them and will those natural products, natural products, because they were derived from the substrate that we created, you know, it turns into like a very complicated issue, which is why I don't believe in the idea of natural and synthetic.

Speaker 3:          02:48:25       Everything is simultaneously natural and simultaneously synthetic. Well, everything comes from Earth. Yes. So even the most unnatural things that human beings are created are in essential natural creations. Like a b creates a beehive of beehives and natural creation. Right? Yeah. It's a mind fuck. So to get back to emoney, to miscarry, uh, do, do you know of anyone who's affectively regularly used it as a psychedelic? Yes, I've met but not people who I wacky people. Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah. Not. Yeah. People where it's like, oh, that guy's a professor and he uses Amany to every night to sleep. He's doing really? But, but yes, wacky people,

Speaker 2:          02:49:09       there's so much lower, again, a attached to it specifically because the Christian, I mean the books by allegro, we're, we're big, right? One of them was the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Christian myth and it was one of his books and that was the second book that he published after the sacred mushroom in the cross. I think he did that because they took the sacred mushroom and the cross off the market. Right. Like what did the Catholic Church by out the rights for that? Or was that a myth as well? I can't remember. It was something along those lines, but Yon Irvin republished it fairly recently with the blessings of the allegro family, but the, the, just the whole connection to Santa Claus and the whole connection to Christmas with that mushroom, it's, there's so much attached to that. Mushroom people want that mushroom to be Jesus. That's the one, you know, that's the way it's the prettiest. It's like it grows. It's got a Michael Riser relationship with coniferous trees. So you find it underneath pine trees, just like the shiny presence underneath the Christmas tree. So people get so excited about that mushroom.

Speaker 3:          02:50:15       Yes they do, but yet no one gets off on it except wacky people. Yeah. It's a complicated situation and you know, just because something's convenient isn't a good reason to say that it's the truth. There are other psychoactive mushrooms that may have been used in the past. They're ones that we've discovered recently. There's a species called Rodo, Columbia Maculotta, as far as I know, that there's no information about humans consuming this mushroom, but it contains this Salvinorin, a type kappa opioid agonist. This could be a completely different type of psychedelic mushroom. No information on it exists. Maybe someone used it somewhere in the past. I don't know. Whoa.

Speaker 2:          02:50:51       Well, isn't there? There are some psychedelic substances that have been discovered that have no history of human use. Like isn't Hawaiian baby. Woodrow says, I, you say it doesn't have lsd like properties, but no history of human use.

Speaker 3:          02:51:05       Um, that's a complicated question. Yeah. There's maybe not with Hawaiian baby woodrow is, but with morning glory seeds, there does seem to be some mezo American history, although it's not as well founded

Speaker 2:          02:51:18       and morning glory seeds. We'll put you on the moon, right?

Speaker 3:          02:51:21       Well, they, yeah, they contain Lsa and um, again, Lsa is actually Albert Hoffman did as the inventor of Lsd did it and experiment where he injected himself with small quantities of Lsa, but there aren't many evaluations of the pure material. So the exact nature of the different components in those seeds remains a little bit mysterious as far as I'm concerned. Some people will suggest that it's the strongest, naturally occurring psychedelic. Other people will say that it's not even psychedelic at all, that it's just a hypnotic. It just has a sort of sedating quality. I've used Hawaiian baby wardrobes many, many years ago and um, it's certainly psychoactive, whether I'd call it classically psychedelic is a complicated issue. It's of like a dreamy,

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       unpleasant delirium. Hm. Um, any other ones that we could go to that are weird. Watch my show. I think you'd really like it. I'm sure I'd like it. I like all your stuff. Okay. Because it goes into lots of weird. I just don't have enough time. There's too many things that are cool now. Yeah. That's one of the problems with a Netflix and hbo and Youtube and just too much cool stuff, but this will be cool. I will definitely watch it. Okay. Uh, that was three hours, man. It just flew by. Well, not crazy. That is crazy. We got have time more over here. So, uh, listen, this is way better than the first time we did it. We were here I think. Got a lot of cool information now and I really appreciate you coming back, man. Thanks for having me do this again, but not in seven years to quicker. Yes, I hope for sure. Thank you. And on twitter and Instagram, it's Hamilton Morris. And your show is Hamilton's Pharmacopia. It's. Is it available online because people watch it online? Yes, it's on Hulu and streaming on Amazon and streaming on itunes and it's on vice land as well. So yeah, easy to find. Thanks man. That was awesome. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          02:53:36       Hmm.
