Speaker 1:          00:00:02       That's what a professional does. Professional turns that bitch down down. Huh? A nonprofessional or someone who's half ass in it. They keep that phone up. Really? Yeah. Have you seen that? Yeah. Some people keep that phone up, that check that phone on time. They'll check in the middle of podcasts. Russell. Peter can't leave his phone alone to really try again through a fucking whole podcast with Russell Peters without checking his tweets. What? Impossible. Impossible. He's checking things. Some days you read off tweets and say, oh people. Oh Doug Benson used to do that. That's why. Can't read off the tweets. I'm trying to get away from it. If I can't, I'll find times if I'm going to go eat now, I'll leave it in my phone, in the car. Power move and hadn't done that before. I just started and it's not even a natural choice I'm making almost.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       It's like something I need to do. Yeah. To chicken shit. Move scared. Scared to leave it in there. Yeah. Scared. Scared. Lead that foam would have some important. I asked if I needed to know, but there isn't. There is a thing like what if something important happens? Yeah, but what do you think like when does that happen? Super Rare. But if it did happen where your phone was in the car and somebody needed you, you'd feel terrible. Right. But you can just. What is the, what's the balance? It's so slippery when we didn't have any way to get in touch with back in the day. You have to yell for help. Remember that? Yeah. You can't yell how? Yeah. Not in Los Angeles. There's too many people. You yell for help. Nobody's in some languages helped mean something else. I think it's, you know, something not good at or something in Arabic or something.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       People will fuck you up. You just make that up. I'm not sure. Honestly, I think I might've heard that because I live in Westwood and we have a very diverse over there. There's a lot of people sometimes yelling stuff in the street. Do you think a for real do you think help mean something bad in other languages? So real. Somebody told me hello means go to hell in like Greek or Latin, like, um, like politics means like a political, like, uh, like um, something like not good, like something tick, like a tick, like blood sucking. Oh really? The government or something like that. Let's start with one. Let's start with, uh, should we do it with hello first? Yeah, I think because, and I just say things and I don't even know sometimes think somebody just told me to say hello when I was young and I've been saying in my whole life, but what does help mean is helping anything in another language is help a bad word and other languages.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       So I'm looking up if the word help means something in another language. Not that there weren't help. If the word help means something in another language that you're gonna have to award it. You're gonna have to word it uniquely I think because it's a. that's a hard one. That's a, that's a, that's yeah. I don't even know anymore. Now it's translation. Something like that. Maybe an Arabic or something. I'm not. I that have any sort of alternate meanings and other languages. He, I'm not accusing anybody the Arab nations or whatever, or a beach or whatever, you know, the Arabic and Hebrew, like those old old languages have the coolest letters. Like the way they write things, like you look at some old Hindu script or something like that. Like why is that looks so cool. It seemed like a mystery man. Anytime, like even Russian when you see Russia and written out and you're like, whoa, look at the crazy little letters they have.

Speaker 1:          00:03:30       Like, look at that. Like this is like some alien writing. Yeah, I'd be furious. I'm like, I couldn't, I couldn't imagine having to learn some of the other languages. You know, like I'm going to China next week we want to Shanghai and I'm like, it's basically just gonna be looking around at different drawings, you know, like as far as even though words go, it's going to be. I think they have a lot of stuff in English there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Are a lot. A lot of countries where there's a lot of tourism. They just put stuff in English. English seems to be the language that most European countries, like most people know you can, you can kind of get by and in Italy you can kind of get by in Germany, just speak English. It's a, it's, it's really interesting man, because it's because I guess there's so much tourism and I guess everyone's worried about us because we have the nuclear bombs.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       Everybody learned English and we traveled a lot because we have more money here probably. So we have the ability to go places maybe. Um, do you like English? That's the only language I know. So yeah, I like it, but it's just weird how much cooler other languages look when they're written out. I guess it's just because we're what we're accustomed to, but like tie at writing or like I was sweating. I tried to read something one time and tie. I was sweating by the end of the craziest. I mean ic food. Yeah. Like it just, like, it took me out of my element, man. There was a couple of, uh, a couple of words off, uh, you know, I almost needed help Asian characters look like if you had a movie like a science fiction movie and in the movie they found a crashed Ufo and it had some writing on the I beams or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:08       It would look like a lot of Asian writing. Right. It would look like something, something crazy from Asia that like, you're like, what am I looking at? Right. Like alien issue. You're saying I might as well be alien writing if you don't know it. Yeah. If there were alien writing, you think it's going to look more like something from Asian writing than it is from American writing. Well, it'd be weird if it was like comic book font. Yeah, like a or whatever. It's like, wait a minute. Alien speak English. Yeah, Bro. Everybody does. What if aliens were in like a Boeing shuttle man? That's the biggest mind fuck that I ever heard was that because of the size of infinity [inaudible] not only is there another theo vaughn out there in the world, but because infinity is so big, I'm going to butcher for short. We talked about this a little bit less.

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       I was in. He did. We did a little thing you've ever done. Someone has done the exact same things, the exact same order down to the last millisecond. Do you believe? Do you. Okay. So that's something that you think are, that's something that you think that could be really true. I think it could be really true. Um, but honestly my brain is not really strong enough to compute that, so I would have to take many, many, many hours to really thinking about what that means because right now when I'm saying what I'm saying, I'm like, it's one of those whoa dude. Things like I'm saying it, but I'm not really thinking it through. Yeah. I. How much, how much are you really thinking through? Yeah, just a couple of steps. You're not really thinking. Okay. That there's a. So then that means for you, there's another, there's another man out there who did comedy it last night at the comedy store who wore, did the exact same set, tripped over the exact same words, spelt his water the same way every.

Speaker 1:          00:06:52       It's supposed to be everything and not. Not only that, but because infinity so big. They're supposed to be an infinite number of those people out there. Yeah. I don't want that. I don't man, because that would hurt my feelings. Honestly. It would make me feel. I think it makes accept. I think it makes sense. I think the universe is so big, right? I mean, everything's so big. Just what we know about our solar system so big. It's so big. That alone, it's crazy. The idea that there's no end to the crazy. We're like, Nah, Nah, it's gotta be an end. No, no, no, no, no, no. That's too crazy. Like what's too crazy when it comes to the universe, the universe is crazy. There is nothing about it that makes any sense. It's so crazy that we don't like to think about it. Last night I was watching the fireworks and the fireworks were going off and I was thinking, yeah, this is Kinda cool.

Speaker 1:          00:07:46       You know what's cooler? The fucking billions of flying explosions that are above our heads, the fireworks that are constantly in the sky. It's like we just, we'll get together for like some something made in Honduras, but the fact that they're like shooting stars every night and nobody gives a fuck. Yeah. And we like because the streetlights, we don't see the craziest light show ever, which is the Milky Way. Yeah. You know, when you draw, make that drive out to vegas or you know, into driving through Montana at night or something like that. You pull over. What does that. Is that fireworks from last night by last night? Just from a, the NBC for helicopter Pasedena to downtown. That's awesome. Those are illegal. At least half of them are illegal. Right. I would say most of them are illegal. It looks like a lot of like a kind of civil war artwork also sped up dude for a firefighter, that has got to be a crazy time, but some of them get off.

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       I think on fires, like some of them, I think they want a little bit of fire. You don't think? Yes. Well, it's been proven that some people that are mentally ill that become firemen and actually start fires something, you know, it's not, it's not 99 point nine, nine, nine percent of them or whatever the number is, but occasionally in every line of work, you know, you get someone who's crazy. Yeah. And I could see that dude, you want something gone and you don't have a lot of money or anything like that. I think of that. It's also just that they're crazy. Yeah. You know, they're just. Some people there's something wrong, right. There's, there's connections that are being made in there and then not they, they, they're capable of doing things just to deceive. People would rip people off or they're capable of doing things for their own personal gain, like lighting a building on fire just so they could put it out.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       Like there's some people that are just broken, like there's something about them that's just not connected. Right? Yeah. We should shut them down, man. I think. I think in the future we have to have some better programs to find out who's just not even who doesn't care about people. Yeah, yeah. There's people that don't care about people who doesn't care about people because if you don't care about people then it's just not. Then you shouldn't be here. He should be somewhere else. You should be in a place where they don't have any people, you know? Yeah. It's just a dangerous thing to have around. For the most part. It's fine. Right? Because life is fairly easy and civilized times. Right? Most of this stuff is fun. Most of the stuff without, you know, the caveat for the occasional chaos, but it's just fucking. It's hard to tell how crazy people are until something really happens and me and you really need to count on them and when they, you know, when you're pinned underneath the dresser and they look at you and they just run out of the room and just take off, you know, like, you're not even going to help me.

Speaker 1:          00:10:27       Wow. There's people like that. Do you think some of those people didn't even know that they would? Do that until the situation arises that that's sometimes what I would love to have some and I know this sounds a little dark but like to have some serious stressors in our world to find out even who I really am, you know, like to see who rises to like who you are inside, like what rises to the core of my skin and says this is who I am. You know, like I got trapped in an elevator, wants to do with like seven or eight people. Okay. And this sounds like a small idea, but this was like three hours, right. And suddenly like at first one dude's kind of verbose. He's suddenly like I'm the leader, but like an hour later he's like trying to fuck a couple chicks that are also stuck in the elevator and you start to see like, okay wait, when he was trying to fuck them, like it was hitting on them or he's trying to actually get down in the elevator.

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       No, he wasn't kind to fucking other, but he was maybe going to fuck them later if they got out of the elevator a safely, not like a rape or like a guy who's going gonna date them or take them to dinner and then hopefully have sex with them at some point if they want to as well. But he um, but you know what I'm saying? So yeah, consensual sex. Yeah, yeah, there you go. But he, but you started to see who was who, like one guy was like, just literally wouldn't listen. Anyone tried to rip the doors open for two hours and then like just like, just like gave up on that one lady was really scared. Like immediately it started to kind of fold out who was going to be who, you know, I wouldn't know what to do. I don't know if I don't think you're supposed to climb out though. That seems like

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       death, right? Climb out into that shaft. You're supposed to stay here as far as I know you're supposed to stay. I mean, they must have some sort of regular, but you know, have an elevator fell in one of the UFC hotels like real far and fucked up CB dollar away. One of the UFC fighters. His back is fucked up from that. Apparently. Apparently he's suing. I don't think he fought that day. I think they had to cancel his fight. I think I might be wrong about that, but I know his back was like significantly fucked up from that fall. Elevators make it too easy, man. I miss the old days sometimes when you do this for the fight. He scratched from the fight. Yeah. And he's fought since, but I think he's still having problems with his back. Yeah. And yeah, it's hard to fix, to have back to one of the hardest.

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       One of the hardest things to make better again. It seems like every time people get surgery, it's just a slippery slope. It's very rare that someone gets surgery on their back and they go, oh, my back's great now. Everything's fine. It's always like, yeah, I got to go in again. I got another disk. You're like, oh no. And they're literally getting their back fused from top to bottom. No dudes with like four or five fake disks in their back that are still fighters to Yo know. Hey, tito has several fused in his neck. He has artificial spacers from where the discs used to be. He has that in his back, his multiple operations on his back. Do you think that that like, because some people think like you know, a lot of your ci and you're like line up as in, you know, like you're.

Speaker 2:          00:13:30       Do you think that that catchall tourney of it? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know if that's real. I don't know. What is that? Is it, is it the actual disk gelatin or as the spine itself? The spinal column. We're all the. All the nerves are firing all the way up to the brainstem. Yeah. It's really fucking crazy thing to risk. If you think about that, like the connection between your brain and then that cord that goes to all your body and everything moving and it's all just this back area that very few people ever even exercise, which is so crazy. Everybody's doing all this shit to get your biceps looking fly and pump your tits up and very few people are concentrating on like lower back exercises. Reverse hypers, protecting your spine, putting muscle all around that bitch. Work that core. Do like kettle bell windmills. You ever do? Kettlebell windmills do? Oh Shit, they're so good. Kettlebell windmills, you. You press the kettle button. You go down and touch your touch the ground by your foot and then straightened back up again. It's just amazing for your spine, like all the muscles around your back that stabilize everything and your obliques and your abs and all your core. It's a great exercise. I've got to do more like adult fitness, man. I got to Gel a little bit. You're. That's what it looks

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       like. Damn. Look at all that shit. That's the human spine. Yup. That's the nervous system. That's the nervous feel like I'm an eat this in China next week. Dude. In a weird way you can have dick over there. Somebody said they can. You're gonna have human. A human. Indeck of mine said that, and he's eating a lot of how he's eating everywhere. Is He Andrew Zimmerman, honored foods guy now the podcast? Yeah. He's a chef. He travels all over the world. Really? Cool guy. Welcome this. That picture is fucking bizarre, man. To think that that's all the stuff that's firing your nerves. That's crazy. And what does that. What does that even look like? It almost looks like a jelly fish or like a. It looks like it's reaching for something doesn't. Yeah. Shooting off into the cosmos son thing at the top is making nuclear bombs at the top is making four g cell phones and 40 megapixel front facing cameras.

Speaker 1:          00:15:43       It's Megan. That thing is megan time machines. That fucking thing is making satellite transmission of video signals and simultaneously delivered to televisions worldwide. That's what that thing is making, dude. You're things making Tesla's robberies, pigs making pistols and steroids. That things make it oxycotton that fucking things make it everything. That's what's fucked up about the human breast. Scary is that when you think about that things making whiskey, that things were making crack crystal meth or crank things, making nail Polish and fake tits, that thing is off the chain. If you look at, if you looked at the human brain for like all this shit that is responsible for you, Blake, what? That area. Oh my God, and it looks like something you would think maybe wouldn't even do nothing to. You walk by that on the street and you didn't know it was a brain.

Speaker 1:          00:16:37       You'd be like, oh man. She asked. One of my favorite out here. You was kind of a game is Mars attacks where they have. They're exposed brain. Remember that you don't remember Mars attacks. I never seen anything like that. Never saw Mars attacks. I don't watch all of this is one of the greatest movies of all time. It's Tim Burton, right? Is that who I believe it's because I'll watch something amazing. It's so good. Dude. Jack Nicholson is in it and he pleased, pleased to obviously different people really, but it's obviously the same guy playing to people and it's never brought up so it's a great movie man. I mean it is a great, great movie. Oh, it looks bad dude. It's so good. Is it really? It seems like it looks bad because you're watching here, but it's all on purpose. It's on purpose. It's like when the, when this is what it is, is they somehow or another captured how we feel about this time period. They captured it with this weird like Vegas thing with this is the president back then and when these aliens come off this spaceship, it's, there's something about the way they moved to makes you think like you're watching a movie from the fifties but still good, like just

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       good enough. But what he did by making the effects weird and barely real is he almost gave you in this stallion for like 19 sixties, 19 seventies movie. You can see that a little bit right here. Yeah. But. But it's better. It's way better than anything they were capable of. I mean, look at the fucking, the shadows and the head and everything like that. Watched a little bit of this real quick. This is when they first land

Speaker 3:          00:18:17       come in.

Speaker 4:          00:18:25       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       Oh, that's cool. Do you think you'd eat something from Mars? If they had, like, if they had to say this because I knew you'd like to be a wild eater. I've seen some of the stuff you eat. You eat kind of rare. You know, you, you, you know you're not, you're not afraid to eat the rayer. And would you have, um, say this, they catch a, a Mars donkey or something, you know, and they just, they're serving up. You don't even know what's in it. Bright Eyes Wide Shut party serving up a donkey from Mars, right? How many pounds of that? But you can add the. I would need it. No chance. First of all, people were. First of all, people are going to be definitely mad at you. You think people are mad at you for eating animals on earth. Imagine eating animals from space. Only one.

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       Don't be so fucking mad at you. Second of all, I would want, I would not want to be an early adopter of Mars meet. Really don't want to sit back. Look this, people that are convinced that meat, I don't agree with them, but there's people that are convinced that meat is bad for you. That meat itself is bad for you. Yeah, because a lot of people that eat meat wind up with a bunch of heart disease. The problem is that they're not really measuring just the meat. They're just measuring people that eat meat. What else do you eat? You eat a lot of sugar. You have a lot of bread, you have a lot of pasta. You eat a lot of this and you drain Tony's. Yeah, you might have. You might smoke cigarettes, so it's hard to tell and I think different things are good for different people, but people can't even agree on whether or not it's healthy to eat meat.

Speaker 2:          00:20:06       There's some people that disagree in it, right? What's. Wouldn't you want to wait to see what Mars meet to people? Wouldn't you want to fucking I, I'd want to sit back and be like, dude, I'm good with Bison. You can eat those Mars donkeys all day long. I'm going to see what a 20 year profiled fucking donkeys from Mars eaters looks like. A little bit of star dust steak or something at a Mars. They only have one, but I'm saying that one donkey. Yeah, but it could be like some preannounce getting your system and you got mad cow disease like blindly. You could also. What if you adopt a superpower by eating it? That's true. That's one thing that nobody ever brings up with nuclear energy, like all this, all these nuclear disasters, everybody's terrified of mutations

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       and radioactive waves and all this shit's going to fuck us up, but nobody remembers comic books where every single time somebody got hit with some radioactive shit, they became a superhero superhero. That's never happened here. I wonder if I could handle the dude if I had a super. I just feel like I would tell everyone it wouldn't be able to keep it a secret. Some secrets powers. You're allowed to just tell everybody. Some dudes, they just tell everybody, right? Like who? Who doesn't have to keep it a secret. Obviously the thing he can't keep it a secret. What is it that the big x men, they had to go? Yeah, but they had high, but the thing doesn't hide. The thing is just, that's what he's covered in rocks, you know? Say. Yeah. Oh yeah. But the big fists. Yeah. Giant club time. Who else doesn't have to hide anything? You can hide anything. Bruce Bannister, who, who's, who is personable banner. Bruce Banner. Bruce Banner. Do you know when they show as a carpenter? Isn't he? No. No.

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       Do you know that when they did the incredible health TV show, they changed his name from Bruce to David because people thought Bruce was gay. Really was a lot of bruises. Ged then do. That's always been the stereotypical name. Oh wait, when like a comedian would do a hack joke about a gay guy, they'd be like, birth me randy over. And really I would never heard Randy, but bruce, it's always been bruce is the name that they would use. So apparently people in the seventies when the hulk TV show was around with Lou Ferrigno. Oh yeah, yeah. They just decided like, Hey, let's, uh, let's change this name, change it, make it David David Banner and we all comic book Dorks like me. We're like, what? How dare you, how dare you change his name? That was the best show ever because it made it feel like a, it may.

Speaker 1:          00:22:37       If, if you were ugly, you can still be cool and do neat stuff. I felt like, well it was the revenge of people who are bullied and picked on. There's the idea that you could be this nerdy guy and you get picked on by these assholes and you just fucking hulk out become bulletproof. Yeah. I met him at the post office one time. The frig. No, I met him. He's a real nice guy. Yeah. He seemed nice. He was with a lady friend and it might have been his wife a thing. He's still yoked as fuck. He's jacked like, you know, um, he looks really good. Like you looks healthy too. It's crazy. I mean, the dude's got to be deep into his sixties, but he looks very healthy. He might wonder who, who, who. Um, I wonder if people are going to start living for like a really like looking at them there. That dude looks healthy as fuck and now they are. He looks a little bit more, more reasonable. Yeah. I mean, look, he was a gigantic supersized human at one point in time. That's what he used to look like. What the fuck is that? So big. So when you saw him on the hulk, the problem was he couldn't really be that defined for long periods of time and film a show because it

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       was too unhealthy. Oh, it's super unhealthy when those guys are like right about to pose down when they're about to. They're on death's door. They are really unhealthy. They get lightheaded. Look at that dude. Oldest fuck. Who is that old and jacked? That Willie Nelson. That looks like a 75 year old jack man. See them. They have those, that row say that guy gets shot and killed. Dude. Depends how far I am from civilization. Okay. Let's say you're far man. Eat them. Yeah, I'd eat them if it was, whether or not eating them or not surviving, getting home to my family or something like that. Say this, then I'm going to put you under a little bit of, um, uh, some, uh, if you don't mind. Is that okay? Do it. Please do. Okay. So a ship went down a shuttle and air ship or something, a plane.

Speaker 2:          00:24:29       And you know, like that movie alive, right? You're out there. Do you? Are you the chef? You know you're going to eat it. You know you're going to eat well. It's whether or not the bodies like the people are killed already. The real problem is when people start killing people and meeting people, then you've got a real problem. Okay? People are already killed. People are already dead. It's to senior citizens. That's it. It was a small plane. Well, you got to decide. People can live without food for several weeks, especially if you're the average American. You've got a lot of fat in your body. After a day or so, your body kicks into fat burning ketosis mode, but you're going to be hungry though. You're going to be hungry, but you will be less hungry believe it or not. After the first day, once your body kicks into fat burning, like have you ever been on a fat burning diet?

Speaker 2:          00:25:11       I've just on Paleo for a month. It's a little different because Paleo, you're still eating a lot of carbohydrates. Just cutting out all the grains and things like that. When you go on a fat burning diet, one of the first things that happens is your appetite just changes radically. It's really weird. Like you just stopped being hungry the same way, like hunger isn't a desperation thing. Like when I know when I'm not ketogenic because then my hunger gets desperate, like I have to eat something. Like I feel like, Ooh, I never feel like that. With Quito it's like I'm hungry, but I'm, I'm okay. It's like and through the day, like energy levels are much more stabilized. That's what I felt like on Paleo. I'd never done anything like that. I mean, I lost like 11 pounds was telling them think I was supposed to lose, like I didn't really have like a plan or anything, but next thing you know, like I felt, I never felt like I had to eat.

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       I felt like I needed to eat to get to the next few moments in my life, but I didn't feel like, okay, I got to make a big deal about eating. It felt more like a survival technique, like eating all day and then my mind, I felt I did feel more energy. I never felt like that after eating I always felt like, okay, I can eat and then still go do something. I could go play cards or run around or you know, chase a friend or do anything, you know, hang out. Yeah. The um, so who do you think you would have to? You have to first of all, talk to everybody about because you got, like I said, you got two weeks, right? You got two weeks for your body can just go on fat. So you're going to start using itself. It, that your body starts eating itself.

Speaker 2:          00:26:41       Okay. You got to talk to people and say, listen, this person is dead, okay, this is just meat now that can keep us alive and we can survive and we could see our family and our friends or we cannot eat this person and would take a chance on going hungry and we might get too weak to get outta here. Like you have to think like, what if, what if you can get saved, but you have to be able to hike out 30 miles in the mountains. Okay, so now you really planning ahead. Then a lot of you have to. You have to you you're, you're either going to die or you're going to live. Okay. These are the only two things that could possibly happen. The Internet even mattered at this point, so you've got to figure out, is it even possible that you can live?

Speaker 2:          00:27:22       Is it possible you might be? Might not be. You might be in the mountains in the winter with nothing around you to eat, no way for you to get off the mountain because it's too dangerous because you get cliffed out every time he tried to go down and then try to get back up and you can't get back up and you're stuck. You could fall and die. It happens to people all the time, so it might not be that you can make it, but if you are going to make it out, you're going to want to have some energy and so different people have different fitness levels obviously, so some people like they're not even going to be capable of hiking out. Would it be take a lunch. I mean, you don't have to eat the whole person. Right? Then like you guys could. You would eat them in parts for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:28:02       What would you have? It's a psychologically devastating. The thought of just eating human meat. It's psychologically devastating. You. You're crossing a threshold that you know you're in, you're into. It's a dark art. To me, it's everything. It's everything. It's sad. It's crazy and it's also a rich part of, you know, human adventure history. There was always like, you run into cannibals, you know, it was like a pig part of those crazy movies about it in the jungle. They got eaten by cannibals. Even Brady Bunch. Remember they came across some people, I think they were cannibals weren't cannibal, but like all, even cartoons, all of them did. It was cannibals or like a joe versus the volcano. Remember that. And I don't remember that. I think he came across cannonballs well there was saying Hannibal's in history. A lot of cannibals. I didn't know that there was so much cannibalism amongst native Americans.

Speaker 2:          00:28:51       Native Americans would cannibalize settlers. They would. Some of them like the Nez perce Indians. Steve knows telling me about that. They would cut dudes up and eat them. Like, Whoa, that's, that's crazy. Imagine. Yeah. If somebody goes down and you're this and there's a part you already know, you like it. Like, I'm cutting this dude's sand. I'm having a little bit of fucking ligament right here on this hillside. Rough man. The guy got killed by a polar bear yesterday in front of his kids in Canada. He was protecting his kids from the polar bear and uh, he died 31 year old dude.

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       You know what, that's a hero though. I mean, these kids will think of him as a hero. A bet he lives in that same place where those people live on that life below zero. I think it's called nunavet people's lives. He lives. Uh, I mean he lives in a really, really remote area that has polar bears. Polar bears are the most dangerous bear you could ever run into because they are the only animal that all, all of them actively hunt people. Really? Nunavut. That's the place where it was. Yeah. They, they hunt everything. Everything that moves. They don't. They don't have any vegetables up there. So the, they're the only 100 percent carnivorous bear. All they eat is meat. All Day is meet. Every other. Bear is like eating berries and berries or ignore you. If they've got a whole field for a barrier. I not chase you asshole to your bones and all that bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:30:21       I'm just gonna eat beverage, Lazy Vas. I did some various laying on his back. They love berries and you find like giant fields of blueberries. You'll find bears just snacking away, having a great time eating blueberries. They'll do it all day. Not Polar bears. Polar bears eat your asshole. I'll kill you. They kill everything, man. I would hate that. I would. If someone was trying to eat me, man, I would just be so upset. I think. Yeah. Did you see that lady that got in trouble because she shot a giraffe? She shot him that she shot a rare giraffe and so everybody's freaking out on her. It seemed sad, man. That giraffe seemed like it probably wasn't going to do to her. It's not going to do anything to her for sure. It's a. It is rare for an animal to get that old. It's 18 years old.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       It's real dark. You haven't had dark skin or something. A little bit of the old males. They get dark. That's super cool. One thing though that people need to know. See, all these things are complicated. They're not as simple as everybody wants to think they are, and this is one of the things that's complicated about this store is that that draft was killing little giraffes. It's a normal thing. The old bowls like that one, which is a big, massive 18 year old animal, a huge, huge animal. Uh, he just was not having it with these young ones coming up, not having it. What do you think it is? Jealousy or anger? It's just nature. You know, they, they kill off the younger males, like pissed at the neighbor kids kind of thing. Don't. They just don't want anybody taking their spot. They don't know that they're riding off into the sunset.

Speaker 2:          00:31:55       Like he's not a viable breeding male anymore, but still huge. So at 18 years of age, he had killed off three young bowls. So they were going to have to kill him. Right. Because it's not good. You need the bulls to keep the thing alive. What was, well, not just that he. This is a species of giraffe that already has a population problem. There's not a lot of them. And if he's killing off these young bowls, each one of those young bulls could have fathered countless children. So they're missing all these future children for one bull who can't even breed anymore. And he's going to continue to do it. He was seeking out the young bulls. Yeah. Already killed three. Like this is not a cut and dry thing. I don't think it looks cool to pose with a rifle and a giraffe. And

Speaker 5:          00:32:39       I mean there's something about giraffes that are so gentle that they let kids feed them when you go to the fucking zoo. Right? I don't. So I get why people would be upset. But when you find out what it actually is, you go, oh, this is not as, this is more complicated than I'm. Than I'm seeing on the surface. It's not simply a cruel person shot a giraffe and we should be angry at her. It's like, no, they had to shoot that giraffe because it was killing other giraffes. So is it appropriate the way she celebrated it? That's when you have to wonder, you know, but they were eating it. I mean, that's the other thing. It's like they got fucking 800 pounds of meat or something like that out of that. Wow. That's a huge animal. I think it was more than that. Then they say 2000 pounds of meat.

Speaker 5:          00:33:24       I think it's a 4,000 pound animal and they got 2000 pounds of meat, which they give to all the villages. All the people there and I know people like, wait, I don't give a fuck. You shouldn't shoot a draft. I feel the same way because when I see a giraffe I don't think of it as something I want to shoot and eat. I think of it as something a little kid can feed at the fucking zoo because they're so gentle. They're so gentle that they like people feed them. Oh yeah. They had a thing by our home when I was growing up, they had a thing dude at a couple of giraffes out there, a couple of lambs and shit. You can get out there and buy a little cup of corn and go out there and you don't even have to know. Like you don't have to sign away.

Speaker 5:          00:33:56       You don't have to do anything, you don't even have to fucking be able to read very well and you could fucking feed a Giraffe, you know, point blank is the only animal that is a wild African animal that we let kids feed at the fucking zoo. Little kids can feed them. Yeah. I can't believe that there's that much. I mean, when I hear that for one, the lady, what did she, why did she have to put that picture out? What was in it for her to do that? If she even knew like she's a hunter and she was excited that you got to kill a big giraffe, you know, and the, you know, it gets. It's, it gets strange when you just kill a bunch of things and make stuff. Trophies and you put them in your trophy room and you go, well I want to get it now.

Speaker 5:          00:34:36       I want to get a Ram. Okay, I got a ramp. Now I want to get a mountain goat. I'll get it. And you got like this menagerie inside of your house. That's it gets dark man. Now I want to get a mouse. Now. I want to get a stepdad now. I want to get a fucking. But then is like, okay, but if you're eating all of those things and this is how you get your meat. Yeah. Is that okay? Well, yeah, that's okay, but there's something. There's something. We all have a strange feeling about this. The idea is that people are killing these things and they're getting some kind of pleasure out of it and then not doing it just to eat it. Right. It's not like even if you you are going to eat it, we don't want you to be really happy when you kill something.

Speaker 5:          00:35:12       That's too. That's some of it. I think the villagers should it be able to. Ones that should vote on if it was okay or not. It's in their village. They would vote okay every time because they get money from it. Then to me then that seems okay because a lot of times it's like we're judging things from so far away. We don't even know. We didn't even know what it's like. We're talking about completely different dynamics in terms of like the way their culture works. First of all, the money for these big hunt so that these

Speaker 2:          00:35:37       people pay to shoot all these different things down there. That's a shitload of money and that shit load of money for that area, for that part of the world is gigantic fuels conservation efforts. It pays for these people that are essentially their version of game wardens, you know, um, and then they have these different people that are employed by these hunting companies and then there's resources to stop poaching and then resources to actively participate in controlling habitat and making sure these animals are in healthy populations and bringing their numbers up. This is all done through the money that comes from hunting them. So it's super, it's super fucked up. Right. It's, it's weird because it doesn't make sense. It's like the people that are paying to keep these animal alive are also the ones that want to shoot up. So people are like, what the F we would like it to be.

Speaker 2:          00:36:31       All the conservation money comes from people who just love animals and want to keep them alive. But that's not the case. That's not the case. No. The money comes almost exclusively because there are a lot of conservation groups that do donate for wildlife protection and for preserving of animal habitats. There are, there's, there's definitely some people that donate, right. But there's no, it's not even close to the amount of money that's raised from hunting to and especially hunting you on that local level. Like you're a, you know, like some of these, like these programs, I'm sure there are a little bit more bigger, more blanket, you know, but you get into that local level. $50,000 can keep, you know, a small town or small habitat around for the year, that money who was getting all that money. But you're right, it's. But it's, it makes us uncomfortable.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       But rightly so. I mean, you look at a Giraffe, you want giraffes to stay alive. You say like, that's amazing, but we have to know the facts behind it. In this particular case where they, that giraffe had to go, that draft was killing giraffes. You ever seen him fight? It's the most familiar thing. They just had buddy each other. They swing their head like, oh, like a mace smash into each other. It's what a terrible way to fight. It's fucking crazy. Suck at fighting Esophagus fucking. It's like Krista. It's almost like Chris delea. Maybe if you were in height and I'm just saying that a love. Absolutely love you. Love as a Sophos, a very prominent target. If you wanted to hit something, have you seen this funny thing, this Jaguar Challenge? Instagram. He's silly. He's so surprised. Very silly. Sometimes you don't really like, dude, he is.

Speaker 2:          00:38:12       He's so funny and he's an a. he's so fucking funny. Very good dude. And very funny. Very silly. He's just sick. He's got his own kind of con. His own kind of funny. Yeah. And he lives. Yeah. And he's so confident and living in that space, man. It's kind of um, uh, yeah. It's, it's interesting. It kind of gets to really get to know that guy. Well that's what you know, it is with you too. It's like your kind of, you, you do your kind of funny. And that's a, that's an interesting thing. Like when someone finds their, like we're talking about Mitch Hedberg the other day, like he had his kind of funny like you could see you'd hear Mitch Hedberg joke and you go, oh, that's a, that's a Hedburg joke. That's how he does his kind of funny. Yeah. Yeah. It's so funny, man.

Speaker 2:          00:38:50       Well thanks for saying that man. Appreciate that. Yeah, I think it's like, as I've gotten a little bit older, it's made me feel more comfortable to just be myself, you know, for so long out here. I'll just felt if I was just afraid to be myself self esteem, you know, who I was, you know, it's all those things, man, you know, it's hard trying to be trying to be confident in what you're doing is a confidence destroying a way to make a living, you know? And I get intimidated. I would get intimidated easy. Like this is the first time I've actually even felt kind of a little bit more comfortable being in here. Really? Yeah. In here? Yeah. Like I don't know if it's not you, it's just something with me, you know? It's just something I don't know. I don't know if it's like, if I feel like if there's like men that are more like kind of physically, you know, in shape or just sitting things maybe inside of me somewhere that make me feel I'm just on, you know, uh, I don't know what it is.

Speaker 2:          00:39:41       It's what people worry about being bullied. For sure. People develop like A. I feel it sometimes I'm around people really. Oh No, I was thinking about that. You like hanging out around like real rare hang out around some real rare animal humans. You know, superhuman. That Daniel Cormier. Dude, that's super human. That big coffee. Jon Jones who human. Yeah. Mighty mouse. Amy's a small superhuman. George St Pierre Superhuman. Have you ever been in an elevator with them or something and be like, we're a bunch of those dudes. Just fucking kill me. Kill you. Anytime they want. You have to deal with that feeling. It's not the best fit as crazy. Well, you're talking to Francis in Ghana. That's always in your mind. No matter what you guys are talking about is a part of you that says if you want to do, he could just kill me like that. Do you get scared with?

Speaker 2:          00:40:27       Sometimes. Honestly, like I get scared for you whenever you have to go in the ring after the fights. Do you ever get scared? A little bit, dude. The first time I ever interviewed anybody ever after a fight, I had an interview Mark Coleman after he choked out Dan several. And this was in like UFC fucking 12. So that was 1997. And uh, Mark Coleman was so fired up man because he had just won the heavyweight title fucking jacked. He was so jacked and uh, he was fucking pumped up and he had no idea Bayer for that movie doesn't even, he was the king of the world back then. Mark the hammer, coleman changed the fucking game. Look at the. Because she was like a real world class wrestler, taken dudes down and just smashing them any was fucking huge, huge, you know. And so I had to interview first interview anybody and had no idea who I was. And it was like, Oh fuck is this guy interviewing? But I ask respectful questions and then gave him an opportunity to express himself and it

Speaker 5:          00:41:33       worked out. But I prepared for that man. I was nervous. Wow. Whew. I was nervous.

Speaker 6:          00:41:40       That's interesting. Yeah. Because it's, to me, I'm like, Holy Shit, this guy, you know, this man is going into the cage after lunch. Yup. Yup. That's what he does. How you. That's it. I felt like me. But like when you go like, you know, I'm not, uh, you know, these, you know, these guys are very, some of these admin are very physically imposing to me. Like. And so when you, sometimes I'm like, man, I can't believe that you go in there. It's just brave as well.

Speaker 5:          00:42:03       No one thing that I think they all know. And if they don't know, I want them to know that I don't want anything other than them to shine. That's all I'm trying to do. Like when I interview people, but I'm trying to do is give them an opportunity to talk about moments. I just want to give them a chance to shine, show who they are. I want them to feel comfortable. I look out for their best interests a really do I try to do that with commentary. Even if it sounds critical, my critical commentary is just expose. Like I look at it in terms of I'm looking at it like it's a math problem or a system and if I see things I'm like, this is. This is an issue. Even if the person can win with this issue, this is a real issue. Like a a high level person is gonna exploit that issue.

Speaker 5:          00:42:46       Maybe this guy can't do it, but this. Sometimes people get upset at that. That does happen, but I say, listen, I have to bose. It made me think I exaggerate, but believe me, those fucking high class killers that see the same shit that I see, they're going to try to exaggerate that shit too, that you're going to try to jump on that little hole. There's a little hole somewhere and that happens all the time with people that get mad. If you point out their holes, it doesn't mean they can't win. There's guys who've gotten their entire career, they rarely throw a kick. They never submit anybody and there some of the best of all time that you don't have to have a fully complete game. Sometimes it's better to just be ultra good at one or two things and those other things just don't fuck with submissions, you know, just don't fuck with me of uh, there's, there's, there's people that are like that. They take someone's back, they never choke them. They just keep punching them. They never took anybody. There's a lot of people like that. And then there's right

Speaker 6:          00:43:38       coons on with raccoons. Do that. Will get read a raccoon on. You never had a raccoon on me. Have you? Oh yeah, they bite you dude. If you ever have one bite you a have. I have one. I've had maybe buy it. I mean I got scratched or bitten. I mean I had to get all the rabies shots. I mean, I grew up in like the rabies bill, you know, so you'd, you'd, uh, and they group up raccoons. Do the raccoons are. They are. I can't believe we can't shut all that shit down. How many of them are roaming the streets at night? A lot. Pro. How crazy stare you down, bro. You ever seen Madagascar and they're fucking. They're everywhere. Did I lived in. I lived in new Rochelle, New York and uh, they used to have these urban raccoon. Oh yeah. Different kinds of raccoon.

Speaker 5:          00:44:20       Raccoons that live in high density areas are bolder species and they have access to massive amounts of food. They just would lift off the lid from the garbage. Can they lift off lid to get

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       inside the garbage? Can they tear the garbage bags? All but. And they'd just be sitting there staring at you to look. And Jack looked at Gold's gym tank top on like they were big. I was like, how is that a Raghu that's a big animal. Yeah. So I bought a blow gun. Shoot Darts. You did. I did. These motherfuckers were wreck my garbage and you're like, shit overnight be sleeping. And I hear the Dang look at him climbing up. Do we have one? And what is he doing? He's going to get that bird feeder and unscrew the bird. He's doing my God. Look how smart is. Dude. This is insane. Oh, smart. This thing is. But also look how confident it is and its strength. And look at him looking over the camera. He knows he's being filmed. And look how he's, you know, I don't think he knows that, but look, look how, how good he is at climbing up.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       I mean, this is crazy. The amount of physical strength is, fucker has. Look at this. Look at that. Just let all that seed go and now was hand partying like crazy and they fuck today. You can hear them at night. We used to live, uh, we used to hear a bunch of them having sex at night and you could hear 'em. You can go outside and even in a residential neighborhood, dude, there's 70 of them on your blog. Like there's so many raccoons living amongst us that it's, it blows my mind that it's not a bigger issue. Pull that up again. Look with the video dude. How many people, even if they could do that, if they had the kind of strength to do that, how many people would even figure out how to navigate that so easily to Matt iseman would host this. This is like American Ninja Warrior.

Speaker 1:          00:46:07       Do you telling me that they don't steal some of these games from this fucker? Look at him. He stopped going full screen because when it goes full screen starts, I don't know what the hell is happening. Look at this. And he said, okay, China person or something. Look at his fucking ability to just hang on there with one arm and then grabbed with his feet. That is bananas. What is that called? An in UFC. Is that a move? Uh, no. It doesn't exist. I guess. Maybe jumped to guard. Yeah, we kind of jumped into garden. It's amazing what he can do. His little bodies. Just crazy. Yeah. How much core strength is a raccoon? Have to have to do that. Oh Dude, so much. And they garbage. It's just freezing. I hit pause on perfect. They can eat newspaper. How crazy is that? Can they can play that, but keep going this, look at this, but look how comfortable he is hanging from his fingers with all four limbs.

Speaker 1:          00:47:01       Like he's just chilling. He's not worried that something's going to happen. He's like, hmm, let me just scoot my ass up here. Climb, climb, climb. I'm just going to twist this fucker off here. Look at him. He's hanging on with his legs and he could just cracked it open and now look at this reverse. Look at this at the end, but the crazy thing is he could hold onto that plastic tube with his hands and feet to of each two of his hands or to have his feet or their hands. Look at the size of their body, their hands. This big tiny. Could you imagine having a little bitty baby hand and having to do something. I know, right? Look how much smarter hand is in their face. You'd have hands like a four year old girl. Imagine opening a door, but you can't even open a door.

Speaker 1:          00:47:41       You just have to stare at a door knob with little bro. I'm talking the littlest hands. Tiny. They'll fuck you up to those things. Yeah. Raccoons eat a lot of chickens too. They like to get into chicken coops. Fuck up chickens. They would jump on your back. It was almost the. Here's the crazy thing I remember about being around raccoons. It felt like they were playing with you, but had an immediate propensity for violence like gay could go like very quick from fun and comfortable to extremely violent. It makes sense. I mean, what a rough and tumble world. The world of the raccoons mother fucker. They live at night. Look at your swing the door. Look at this now. I think this is a close the door here and it opens it again. My grandmother had a friend that had a couple so he just knows how to open doors. Creepy. Fuck. There's something weird about them. Just a strange animal that like almost seems like it shouldn't be real. You know, like a smart, weird animal that lives in the forest. Like you expected to start talking to a little kid that's on a walk. Like who? Who are you? Where are you from? And it's. Yeah, it's got dice and it's little hand one dice. This turnover. Your grandmother won't mind if you hang out with me.

Speaker 1:          00:48:56       Show you a house. It's made of candy. Yeah. You want some lipstick? Putting lipstick on her creepy animals, but that's weird to me. The weirder animals, the animals that have adapted to living right next to people that them. Coyotes. Coyotes. That's them. Are you telling me about a coyote you had at your house? I've got a bunch of them at my house. They're just in the, you know in the hills. If you live anywhere around la in particular, anywhere that there's some trees and shit in between the houses, guess what? You got? Coyotes. They just fucking live everywhere, man. I saw him on all of in Burbank the other day, driving up all of our soft fucking coyotes. I was like, whoa. Somebody who reported a cody fight in my neighborhood when I was growing up and it was somebody made that up, but the cops still showed up and I remember they interviewed everybody like, we fucking do anything about it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       Do you think kind of what he's fight wonder if they do fight with each other? I don't think I've ever heard of him fighting at this. It must make sense. Someone has to be the boss and the coyote world. Wolves. Do Wolves. Fuck each other up. Do they really? Yeah. So awful to kill each other. So He's a coyote. Fights here. Most intense coyote. Oh, look at this. They're going to war right here it is on Worldstar. Worldstar. That's where you draw back right there. Look at that. And other one jumped in. Three coyotes strategically held by Bush. Do you fuck they're fucking each other up. Dude. Do you think we could ever get to the point where you know that humans fight animals like they did back in the old days? You know, like gladiator style? Yeah. Seriously though.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       Yeah. You could do that in another country for sure. Yeah. If somebody from some crazy country where they had some maniacal dicker dictator who's on crystal meth and he decided to have humans versus lions given to a sword and the shield and armor and him. Fuck up a 100 percent. Do you think that goes on? Um, I wouldn't say no. Yeah, because I think there's people with enough money, like fucking crazy, crazy prints money. Oh yeah. If there are prints of some crazy country, there's people just probably can't get satisfied. It's not. They can't get any. Hillary's. Yeah. Cocaine, pussy, pussy, jets. Oh, islands in France. Like what else do I want? What else I want? I want to watch a dude fight a lion with a sword. Yeah. This is probably like some place that you can go. Right. And it's got like a drains in the floor where they hose it down from all the blood and it's built like a hockey rink.

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       Yeah. But uh, the floor underneath the floor, this is zoo just like that. They used to do it in the Roman days and uh, it rises up, they let the animal out, close it down and then they opened the cage and the fucking dude stands there with the sword and the crowd goes and they're all listening to techno music and speak in Dutch. And then suddenly we know where they are at. Dude, in that fucking lie. And Go to war. They go at it, man. Yeah. He think he has like face paint on or anything or he's just [inaudible]. It was probably a good move. Pull a face. Paint on. You need every edge. Yeah. You know you got to fight a line with a sword. You probably gonna get killed. You're going to cut the line and then get killed. That's what you're going to do. Then you get one good hit at it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:13       If you're lucky. Probably won't even really it. Yeah. You swordman yeah. You. You don't have any idea how slow you are until you're around a cat that kills antelopes and shit. Chases after willdabeast takes him out with his face. You're just that you. You have no idea. I think everybody. No, I don't think you get a shot off. I think with the cat wants to the cats on you so fast. You barely have time to move your arm. That's what I think. I don't think. Yeah. I don't think you have any idea how fast a. like a real Predator moves and how ridiculously soft human beings are. Right. Especially if you're not. Some. I don't fucking Conan the barbarian due to can actually swing a sword, a heavy sword with some fucking oomph behind it. Yeah. You ever pick up a real sword? It's heavy as shit, man. It's fucking heavy and it's sharp. It's almost scary to have one sometimes. Yeah. Like fuck. I would hurt myself or I'd cut my cousin up or something on accident or had hurt somebody at the house. Yeah. The odds of you killing that lion with one swipe or almost zero, you're going to get fucked up. Okay. How would you attack it then? Say you're in a place. You've got this sword. Maybe got one other weapon, a small weapon you keep on your leg or something. The only way

Speaker 5:          00:53:27       that I think you have a chance is if you can keep your shit together and plugins that blade and it's chest as it leaps on you as the only way you would have to be ready to as it comes at you to push forward and hold onto that sword with everything you have as it's coming at you and the blade goes into its body. That might be the only way, and even then it's going to walk you and rip you apart. You want. You're not going to be able to. It's not possible. I think he could do it to. Nope. Nope. You don't think you could. No. No. And you would keep both hands on. Now. That's how you acted it out. You keep both hands on it. You are not going to be able to hang on. You're just not. It's a different kind of power.

Speaker 5:          00:54:12       It's the power of many, many men. It's like the idea of a who borrowed. You think you could win a tug of war with 10 dudes? Yeah. Fuck Yeah Bro. Most guys are bitches. Do you have a chance? There's a strength level. You'd have to be like some Herculean, Marriott's, Pooja, Nowatzski type dudes. Some enormous fucking world's strongest man guy with chalk all over your hands and a good grip on the blade and maybe tie it down like a Rodeo rider plunging into the heart of a lion. And even then, I don't think you're hanging onto it. I think that things gonna Book and kick and and you're going to be so terrified if it's a male lion, you get to see that main in that face and your body scare you. You're going to get diminished. Yeah. You're going to be so overwhelmed with adrenaline.

Speaker 5:          00:54:58       Your instinct is going to be to just run away from that thing as far as you can. Do you feel like some truths as like any truths, like any innate truth would be revealed as you're, as you're sitting here looking at each other's eyes and you know that it's going to kill you. I don't think you're even there at that point. I think if you're. I think you're such a primal experience that I think at that point you are probably. You're barely a human. You're just a series of synapses firing that are designed to protect you from predators. I think you just in full panic, full adrenaline rush, full survival mode where you don't. You don't know what the fuck is going on. I have some friends. Fuck man. I've got some friends that got a taxpayer there. They got attacked by a giant grizzly bear and they.

Speaker 5:          00:55:47       No, everybody got away survived luckily, but they were in. They were in an island off of Alaska, of fog neck island, and it's a huge population of brown bears and elk and they all lived together. These, these fucking parents are huge and this bear, which was like an 11 foot bear, charged into their camp and knocked everyone over like guys were flying left and right. One of the dudes is a nicknames. Dartmouth, Dartmouth was riding on the back. If you want to hear the whole story and it's a great story, go to the mediator and I think the episodes just say a fog. Neck island. I don't know if it says bear attack on a fog neck island, but if you're a. If you're a clever googler, you'll find it's a great podcast. Anyway, Steve Rainelle is a genius. He's a really interesting guy and a hunter, like we just totally, totally defies the stereotype that people have of like doofy hunters like super well read.

Speaker 5:          00:56:49       Really interesting guy, but his depiction of this event, the most striking thing about it was that it defied everything that he thought it would be like if there was an actual bear attack. Sounds like hemingway esque almost in a weird way. Well know in a weird way. Yeah. Because when look, if something really fucking crazy happens, the best case scenario is there someone who actually knows how to write. That's right there. When this something crazy happened and this is the case, but instead of writing it, he just does a very eloquent job of describing it as does everybody else there. I mean, there was quite a few guys there. My friend Rammi Warren was there and Yonis will tell us this is one where they got um, false attacked. This was in British Columbia. They got false charged of false charge is a bear this, in this case, it was a bear with cubs and she just want to scare them off. So she came running at them full clip. It's crazy to see because they fired near her, but they had the discipline to not fire her. I'm like, that is really impressive because this thing just came fucking running at them and it's huge. Like here it is. Like give me some volume here.

Speaker 7:          00:58:03       Oh my God, I will shoot to kill this peels off man's away and Callahan says I'll never forget. I want to give them a tee shirt with him and his mustache and this smell us now it smells now lady. That's a sentence that comes to mind,

Speaker 5:          00:58:27       so that is what he had experienced before and so he, he kind of kept his composure in that situation and he was like this other one where the grizzly bear literally knocked them over to the teeth were gnashing 10 inches from his face. It was just so many people. The grizzly probably didn't expect there to be that many people there. There was like seven people there is that my views. Let me think of how many people. One, two, three. At least five people there and I think that's what saved him, but the camera people to is. It probably was about seven people and I think that's what saved them. The fact that this was a giant mass of people and the bear didn't know which way to go, and one of the dudes Yanas hit it in the face with trekking poles. You know, there's trekking poles. He said it was right there, smacked in the face and thing. Veered off. One of the guys, remy, he juked it. He faked right. And then went laugh on the bear. There was just so much going on. The bear just ran through it. One of the guys wound

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       up on the bears back now for like 10 yards there was running and he was somehow into the stuck on the bears back and then fell off. This is how big the bear was in. I think we need to see a bear, man. You don't think it's going to be like that, that intense, you know, you don't think it because the first picture they showed that bear, he seemed like a calm Bayer, you know, look at that bear. I've seen him in. The worst thing about bears is they advertise them mostly Disney movies. How do you see a bear teddy bear? You know what I'm saying? Uh, you know, they have fucking bearish fucking to on the Internet, you have all that kind of shit, but it's like sweeties. Yes, they're your buddy. They're your buddy. Meanwhile, how about those little kids that their dad got eaten in front of them?

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       I mean, what do those little kids, what if they had a little pet polar bear that's not outside the realm of possibility with little kids and you get convinced that that's what those animals are. Look, I'm not saying you shouldn't have a pet stuffed polar bear. They're cute. It's not a path. But you know what I'm saying? A toy. Would you have a little barrier thing as a pet? No fucking way. Man released. Ridiculous. He seemed like a guy that might have a little vague to that dude. Fuck that. First of all, they're not listening to you. Get Away with all that. They might be your friend, it might be your friend as they grow older, but you better keep that food around bitch. And even if you have that food around, you can't keep them from killing other people. Like there was a guy who has his bear trained look at the size of that fucker.

Speaker 2:          01:00:43       Oh my God, this guy's definitely probably. Oh my God, this was like a gay. If you keep this animal fed, there are people that have bears. Does this in Russia is Russia. Yeah. So if there's people that keep bears fed and take care of them and treat them well, you know, and this is the thing about bears too, is at burt bears are omnivores. They eat everything. Oh really? Hate animals. They vegetables, they eat everything. Yeah, it's crazy. They're like people in a lot of way in that they are, you know, their diet very so they don't have to eat, they don't have to kill things. Didn't necessarily have the desire to chase things down and killed things like a cat does. Like cats have a deep desire to kill things. Like cats can't shake that shit. Yeah, I think you could, you could feed a bear well and take care of it and you could probably avoid most of that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:33       But if it ever feels threatened in any way, you're so fucked. And do you think you have any like there, you might not even notice when that bear feels that way, but I wouldn't. I'm not a beer expert. I think a real bear expert would see that something's weird. The Bears Act and sketchy or bears like. Yeah, they just. They start acting irritated. Look at the size of these things, man. This guy is definitely a pervert. You think so? Yeah. This because I think there's got to be something inside of you that gets off in a weird way to do this. I don't think this feels natural. I think they're intoxicated by powerful animals and having these powerful animals around gives them a thrill. Okay. The thrill has to be. Do you think that that, that they could kill him. That's it. One hundred percent. And also did like

Speaker 1:          01:02:19       the thrill is they are beautiful creatures, so you do want to be around them. They're cool to just be around and if you, you can make friends with this beautiful creature that could just kill a mass of people. It's kind of feels fun. Dangerous. Yeah. That's cool. It feels dangerous. It's like a celebrity. It's like no one else, John or are way better. You got a pet grizzly come over my house, motherfucker. I got a 12 foot dog that lives in my house, you know, like, but cats seed. That's it. No more. These are different animals. This is a different thing, but I think if people have an animal like that, they're fucking next to it at night and they're doing. I think some of them shouldn't be. Yeah, probably near it. I don't think they're getting involved with them, but I think they're doing near it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:03       But just fuck right next to the tiger and get them horny. What do beastiality needs? Because I've thought this about beastiality and I don't know if we've even talked about this, but if you have sex with a local animal, something that lives here, how livestock, chickens, something like that. It's fucked up. It's fucked up and it's not, you know, you know, travel overseas with the specific intention of having sex with an animal. Okay. That's, to me, that's so fucked up. You know, the rules are different depending on who you ask. Probably locally, but I'm sure in some places they're like me some money and you can do whatever you want it. I go, no, but if you. If you fuck a mountain lion, that's a strong man. That's how I. that's it, Dude. You never buy a beer again. You fuck a mountain? You fuck a links that to me, that's not beastiality. To me, that's like some Ragnar Loft Brooke type Shit. Yeah. That's the bravest thing you can do. That's a viking shit. Imagine a trying to keep an erection and then sneak up on a bucket animals, but you'd have to. You have to figure out a way to hold him down and you think there's ever a guy the best of the mountain line then fucked it. See, I don't think.

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       I believe there might be another Theo Vaughn or an infinite number of them out in the universe talking to another me and that were sitting in the exact same. The exact same notes. I believe that. I'm not sure I believe any of those people on any of those plants that have planets ever fucked a mountain lion. I don't know. A long time ago. You don't think that when? No, but there's no youtube. There was nobody to tell. The only person who knows is the other two people. People are gonna think they're lying because they're alcoholics. You could eat. I don't think so, dude. I don't think there's any squirrels that rape people either. You know what I'm saying? I think that that's more likely. It's more likely that a squirrel would rape a person. Oh, I could see a school kind of funk. Someone's drunk who passed out in their yard.

Speaker 1:          01:04:53       That's more likely. Like a crazy super horny squirrel. Just can't keep it together. He keeps [inaudible] up. Yeah. Some Kappa Delta just passed out on her fucking yard. You know, had many peanut butter. Crazy. I do not think that a guy could fuck them out in line. I just don't think that's ever happened. Especially not gay sex. Right. Maybe a female mountain lion might let you. She's all wild up and heat and why eat my friend, wasn't it Chris Ryan talked about fucking his cat with a pencil. Did he gave me a shirt? Salt. That's right. He did. That's his shirt. He tells a great story about his cat was in heat and she backed up to him. She was like trying to get some Dick and he put a pencil in their giddy, like a little kid. He was like a little kid. Yes. Sherry was an adult sexual experience.

Speaker 1:          01:05:41       Was this cat backing up on this pencil? Yeah, I could imagine. I did. I remember getting like an erection and just, I remember just hold it against fucking did. I remember being at the library when I was young and this is back when they had, um, books, you know, what do they have now? I mean, you don't fucking know her library still open. Who's hitting their. Just people trying to finger each other. Who was in a fucking liar. You even imagined, I guess books about homeless people allow homeless people in libraries. Yeah. Can we just start calling them shelters? You know what I'm saying? And serve lunch. But I remember going in there and the only sex you could see at the time, it was like Rodin or something like that. Or these old artists remember they would paint like a reuben ask one by shooting him and shoot.

Speaker 1:          01:06:24       But like this, you see breasts instead of one of her hands. Like this weird thing with the hands. Right? Everything was always this way. Why is that? But I remember like opposed indicative of a certain time and history I guess because it's really hard to draw a hand. Oh, that could be it. Maybe somebody drew it. But if you think that like emperors would stand there and do this to their, to their people like you now look, there's two things to trump could do that. People would freak the fuck out. One of them obviously he's like a sieg Heil. Yeah, that's bad. The other one that might be just as bad as the emperor. He comes out with one hand almost like he's holding an invisible football. On the other hand, do this and just addressed to people. People will blow a gasket. He wants to be. The emperor wants me to Buckingham for. Oh my God, dude, he should start wearing a crown. How great would it be if he started wearing a crown? Dude? It would be hilarious if you started wearing like a cheap burger. King one just didn't say nothing about it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       I bet he will. Do you think he. I think he has a sense of humor. He definitely does. Yeah. He definitely. He's the first president that has ever been roasted on comedy central. Oh, that's a great point, dude. He got roasted on comedy central and Jeff Ross even said to him like, like ya'll laughing at the jokes, I could. She'd probably laugh at them like, don't, don't. It's probably people like it better if you're going along with it. He's like, yeah, you're right. And then he loosened up and started laughing. So he takes advice from people that are in the business. They told some ruthless jokes about him. Man. He hung up. Mary handled it. I liked in keys, resilient. Whether or not he can feel any of that because of his like, uh, whatever. Ego spaces. And I wonder how much of that even feels, but only he, he might be the only human in America could take this much hatred from people at such a level that.

Speaker 1:          01:08:21       Yeah. And it doesn't even care. It's weird. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's fucking, it's kind of awesome. It's Kinda. Oh, I remember after he got elected driving down the street and being like, Holy Shit, dude, I could be president puking anybody. That was what we thought when we were kids, to what's awesome about his. And when I say awesome, I don't mean good. I mean amazing about his abilities. Like all throughout all this crazy shit. He doesn't show any signs of being like, it doesn't seem to be like freaked out right over the stormy Daniels Shit or over the rush sugar, all the investigations. Occasionally he goes mad tweetstorm. Yeah. He seems to be the same guy he was before. He doesn't seem to be. There's certain dudes when you see something like, um, it was a good example. Something fucked up happens to them and you see it in their face.

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       They're like, whoa. Like George Bush, whenever maybe on that video in the nine slash one or whenever they see the pictures and they told him about nine. Well, nine slash 11 was huge thing. That's. I don't think he knew how huge it was at the time. It was all breaking out. You know, the bad example. Yeah. But yeah, trump just seems totally unaffected. Just same. No more senior citizens on twitter that, that's a thing senior citizens on twitter is kind of bizarre. Oh, there's a lot of them now. They love it. Will they take a break every couple of minutes of doing facebook all day, yelling at people on facebook. Great. Everybody hates. The guy says, I don't think everybody's. I think a lot of people like the time we're in right now because it's so. It just, I feel like you know what you're going to get, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:09:58       No, it's, it's a strange time for communication, man. It really is a strange time for everything. Yeah, man. It's uh, it's different. It's so different that it's fucking, it's kind of fascinating. I had, um, that got Jordan Peterson came on podcast. He hasn't met him on your podcast, which was wild because I know his publicist, um, and I reached out and the publicist, um, and then it was wild and so then he came through because I mean, a lot of the people listen to my podcast, her, you know, we talk a lot about like being sober and like people that masturbate too much, kind of weird stuff, you know, troubled youths. Kind of I'll say it, right. Um, but anyway, it was cool because he like, I don't know, you know, better than I do. Um, he loves you. He said a lot of Nice things about, oh, that's nice. He's a great guy. He's really misunderstood, man. Misrepresented people think he's some fascist and some Nazi. I didn't think that at all. He's not by any stretch of the imagination. He just says certain things that people are uncomfortable hearing and whether you agree with them or disagree with them, that's one thing. But that's what the demonization is where it gets weird. Even if you would think he's what his idea is foolish. Don't misrepresent who he is as a person because they try to pretend that he's this racist, homophobic, fucking character. He's

Speaker 5:          01:11:14       not by any stretch of the imagination. He's just a guy that especially when his principles are being debated or when his ideas are being tested like he, he'll stand his ground and he's very firm about what he thinks is wrong about things like equality of outcome, like making sure that everybody makes the same amount of money, make sure that everybody achieves the same amount of success like that is a ridiculous idea that leads to communism and Marxism and he gets into it and it made me rethink how I thought about it before. Then I thought about it before then, like an unattainable goal that socialist lean towards because it's like the ideal. The ideal is that money's not a concern for anybody and everybody just sort of does whatever they want to do because they enjoy doing it, not because they're doing it for money and then all the money kind of piled in together and we take care of everybody.

Speaker 5:          01:11:58       It sounds great on paper, right? But then he starts talking about, no, you have to enforce an equality of outcome, right? He goes, when you're talking about a quick, there's going to be people that work harder, there's going to be able to try harder. There's going to be different varying levels of effort because we're human beings. You have to take that into consideration and as soon as these people don't take that into consideration, it's then you're, you're, you're either trying to stop the people that are doing too well or you're trying to take from them to give to yourself and how you enforcing this. And he's, he just takes you down this rabbit hole of thought and really kind of explains the problems with Marxism and socialism. And I'm sure there's really intelligent people that dispute his ideas. I'm not saying that his ideas are infallible or that he's the only voice that I would listen to in these subjects.

Speaker 5:          01:12:41       But he's a brilliant guy and he's a very nice guy too. And he's really missing, misrepresented and in willfully. So a lot. I think it's sad because I think what's missing between right and the left is how much vit we we would probably agree on and if we could just talk about things rationally instead of contentiously instead of getting into these right versus left debates which are just way too common where everybody's on one side is trying to diminish the person in their side and, and, and get angry and they're doing a lot of these in front of big crowds, which I think is also weird because then you're playing to the crowd and I've seen some things that Jordan did with this Michael Eric Dyson guy with the guy was literally wasn't looking at him. He's looking at the crowd, calling him a mean mad white man and it's like I see these kinds of things that people are doing.

Speaker 5:          01:13:28       It's just everyone's just digging their heels in deeper on each side and instead of looking at life like just having an open conversation about things that are troubling things where we could do better things, where society needs work or things. Maybe where our perceptions are off and maybe we could look at the other side and look at each other or look at the whole thing better and figure out a better way around things instead of doing that, everybody's just right versus left and right and deeper in the trenches and harder and we've got to stop trump and I hope we have a recession to stop trump and people saying crazy shit crazy like everybody's supposed to suffer so that you can make one guy feel like he's doing a bad job or just not the way to approach it. Like you've seen that. What is that woman's name? Maxine. What is her name? Maximum trump. I

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       call her dark trump. She says she's, she's wild to interrupt people's meals and draw a crowd and like, you know, and I guess it's in response to what is the most disturbing policy was a separate children from their parents. People that are crossing the border, but I think he didn't. He decided to put a stop to that. Then they decided to put a stop to that. Did he sign something to put a stop to that? Well, it's definitely scary if you're doing that at the border. They did, but I don't know. I read that it didn't do any change anything. Oh really? Let's find out what the fuck that means. We'll find out what would happen. I know it's hard to do that and I, I mean, yeah. How do you separate people from their kids? You gotta be you gotta be trying to send some fucked up message to scare the shit out of him so that'll keep them from coming over.

Speaker 2:          01:15:00       This is the idea. I guess if you tell them you're going to take their kids away, they probably won't even try and then. But what about this say if like, you know, everybody's against like sex trafficking and I'm not like what if one of those people is that scenario and the kids too afraid to say it. I know that's like a maybe more of an acute situation, but in that case you'd be grateful that you separated them at least to get each other's point of view, to know kind of what's a little bit more what's going on. Apparently that's like a huge issue. Like apparently sex trafficking, you know, everybody's just bringing young women in here to, you know, from other places for sex and I don't, I don't see that much of it, but apparently it's the biggest thing in the world, you know, or it was last month.

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       Well, there was something that was, I don't know, this is true either. I'm giving Jamie a lot of work today. Um, there was a smart though, right? Um, sex trafficking ring that was broken up by ice and outside of it these people were protesting ice because of what I, they were like saying abolish ice. But meanwhile ice was like stepping. They didn't understand that when you're doing, what is it? Emma's immigrations customs enforcement. Ice stands for. What they're doing is not just, they're not just trying to stop people from crossing over the border there also busting in this case, apparently it was a sex trafficking or human trafficking ring. I don't know if they were using them as slaves or if they're using them as sex slaves. Well, that's the thing. Say if, say if two truckloads of people coming to America, right. And one is, is, um, you know, adults and children and another as adults and children, right.

Speaker 2:          01:16:36       And one of them are just actual family members and one of them are sex, you know, adults, you know, mean men trying to bring in sex workers. We, that's. Yeah. I mean, how do you know, how do you not set, you know, like, I know, yeah, you don't want to take a mother from a kid or a father from a daughter, but it's like, how do you know what if and what if you don't, you know, I don't know. That is the problem with people coming in. If they're coming in illegally, you have no idea who they are, what they're doing. Yeah. I mean, that's only one problem. The other problem is people who are criminals, people who are violent

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       offenders, you know, people. There's people that have gone back and forth multiple times and got busted in American wind up killing people. That's happened many times.

Speaker 6:          01:17:18       Yeah. They had that guy in San Francisco. I remember that accidentally shot the uh, end up shooting the girl. But yeah, I mean it's, you know, I'm glad. I mean, I, as much as it's hectic sometimes to think about it and here about it, I think it's also, it's neat to be alive at a time when, you know, I'm challenged to think, you know, and I'm challenged to, uh, to, to feel different ways and to hear different voices and opinions about it honestly. Like I feel like we should have more of a roll call in America. Like you have to know who's here before you can even, you know, like if you're teaching a classroom, if you don't know who's in the class, how can you even, you know, but it's

Speaker 5:          01:17:50       what they should do first and foremost is legalized drugs. And the reason being is that they're getting across from organized crime and it's building organized crime in Mexico to a staggering degree. The drugs are here. People are selling these drugs, period. They're going to keep selling these drugs. You're not going to diminish the amount of drugs. You just not. Yeah, no one's ever been able to do it. The drug wars and complete total failure. He Cope. They love coke. So make coke legal. You would put a fucking halt to so much and if you made coke, legal people would buy pure coke. You would it. Would it be tested and you could give people drug education because like everybody knows. Okay, how many beers can you drink? If you drink three beers, you probably shouldn't drive a car unless you're a giant, you know, like three beers. You're probably over the legal limit. Azure of Bayer, right? Let's just some seven foot tall guerrilla type man. We've got a lot of buy in a regular. Like if you are a regular guy disappears. You should not drive. Right. So now stop and think like what is the level for cocaine? I don't know. I don't do it. I've never done it, but I don't know what it is. Like maybe we should know like you know, you can't have three shots of Jack Daniels and Dr. Okay. But what, what about, what about speed?

Speaker 6:          01:19:11       I can take two lines of coke. You should not be talking to people. Yeah. Business shouldn't be fucking calling an architect. Dude. One of my buddies try to put all of his fingers in his butt one time for you to like an eight ball of coke. How crazy is that? Okay, so good goal, but a look and it's hard apparently to do and it's nice to have a name for. What was that called? Fingers in your book called something. It was like called a clapper. The liberty bell or something. Some crazy thing, but I'm Jamie's googling it. What is the term when you have all your fingers in your butt? I think that's called gopher hunting. You have to be like, how would you do that? You'd have to be like lying on your back with your legs, bugs bunny style over your head. You have to hook your left and then this and to be super flexible. Pull it off and you're going to. The crazy part is, and I've just thought about this a lot, but I have thought about this for a little bit. You're going to start with your smallest fingers and then you're going to be stuck. Those thumbs after

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       he going to be trying to get at the. Yeah. That's going to be the hard part. You're going to rip your asshole. Well that's the risk. You take like an old balloon. And that's why it's so exciting. I think if there is no, uh, there has to be some risk of reward in it from us. Have slender fingers. Well he was, I mean look duties on that much cocaine did. I'll do. And you know, I used to. That's the thing, dude. I got all fucked up, you know, I used to get cocaine and do it by myself at home, you know, just to, I don't know, I wasn't doing that good just to have some feelings. And I remember, dude, I would order vests and shit off the Internet. I have kind of vessel all kinds, like the kinds that we would wear if you lived in boulder with them.

Speaker 1:          01:20:46       The downfield ones. Patagonia. Tell him no, I've done. I've gone. That's a weird look. You got the flower shirt with the puffy vest. Very common look. But it's like, what are we doing here? Well, I want to be warm, but I want a lit, a little bit of ventilation in my arm. Just a little chill, just a little bit of warmth around my body though. I liked my tour. Showed to be warm. I'm talking old. I'm talking to all kinds, bro. I wouldn't get the leather. I would get the ones with the bead. I mean I have like A. Honestly, I've probably about 30 vests at home. Well, I vest. Why was that the thing that you would order on cocaine? It was just something I liked to do. Belt buckles. You have any preposterous, like some of that light up different colors and shit. He like.

Speaker 1:          01:21:26       Yeah, I'm going out with this. One of my buddies had a belt. I said Pussy only on it. Oh Nice. Yeah, that guy's gay, but 100 percent gay. They'll push you. What about you fucking go, Bro, you don't want to do what? I get pushy. You know, what do you do? I'll show you both. Take your pants off. And so it was a blue suit first put on it. Be careful. He's like, yeah, I've got a lady a tattooed on my ass, so love it. Let's push it. I got vulva tattooed on my back in a, in old English letters, bro. I love puts you so much. I had my ass hole turned into a pussy.

Speaker 1:          01:22:03       Fuck it. It feels just like the real thing, but eight and a half of your fingers in it, bro. Do you stem cells broke? I got some new stem cells. Do I got these new stem cells used on my ass. So, um, but uh, but that guy, yeah. How do you transition? I don't know, but they got Jordan Peterson was super cool man. What did you guys talk about when you listen to any of this stuff before you had them on? Yeah, I listened to your episode with them extra from the day before and I listened to 'em and I'd been listening to his book. So that's where I was. And I listened to the debate of the munk debates of the ones where the guy called him a bad white man. I was like, this so silly, but I found him to be in this just a. He just seemed like the pure. He seemed completely pure and whatever, you know, he believed, I think that in helping people, like, because I talked to him about like did he start to feel like famous, you know, like because people are really gravitating towards and he just felt it genuinely seemed that he felt just good for people. He Won. He was happy

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       to be helping others and that like, it didn't seem like he had any ego in it. He, um, he definitely does like to help people, but he also feels a responsibility because of his knowledge to explain what he thinks is a problem with certain types of behavior, certain laws and one of them that got them in trouble or got him controversial, got a lot of controversy attached to it was the compelled speech laws for transgender people. The use of a compelled pronouns, meaning Canada. Yeah. So if you decided that you weren't going to be a he or a she, you could make up a number of different names and they would be legally compelled to use those names. And some people are arguing that's not what it says. And then he was saying, no, it's a, it's a human rights violation if you don't follow along with that, like this is, this is compelled speech and this is dangerous because this is why this is what it leads to.

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       And then there's all these people are debating with them. But then when you got a chance to see his, with him debating these points with these various intellectuals, including like gender studies, teachers and Shit, you got to see like, oh this, this is a crazy idea. Like these, these people that think that you should have like 78 different gender pronouns. And then it's, it's tantamount to violence to not use someone's preferred pronoun. And you're like, oh, oh, you're crazy. Oh this is a mad person who wants the world to be different. So you want all these new laws attached to whether or not someone calls them and he or she and they're getting some traction with it. What is weird in New York, New York City, I think it's the landlords and it might be employers my, but I think I'm pretty sure it's landlords. They are compelled to use your preferred pronoun, so if your landlord decides to call you a different thing, like if you say a machine now, and he's like, fuck you knew you when you were theo, Theo.

Speaker 2:          01:24:56       See what that law is. Uh, uh, compelled gender pronouns, law, New York City. But, but people are like, wait a minute, wait a minute, how many do I have to know? Which ones do I have to agree with you start? Because there's a ton of them. Now they're literate is 78 different gender pronouns. You know what I'm fine like, I know they would, uh, you know, for awhile it was like, people in certain areas they don't want to build transgender bathrooms. It's like because there's nine people in this town and we've seen everybody's Dick, like, nobody. We don't have any. You can't change all these zoning laws for peak, for when there's not even someone present in some of these areas. I think in some bad ways they're making people not be accepting of transgender people that they may meet at some point by creating all of this, this, this, this rhetoric or whatever it is, this, this conversation. It's like some people are already fed up and they've never even met someone like this and so then they're going to have weird. They're going to have already like contentious views when they do meet someone just because they've heard so much background noise that it's problematic. You know when not. That's certainly

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       possible. It's also possible that people will be scared of the backlash so they won't use transphobic language anymore. The problem with that is you're not encouraging empathy. You're encouraging fear. You're encouraging fear of not following the standard line of behavior and speech and that's where people have a problem with it. It's like the real way to do it is to promote empathy, to say like, look, these people like this, guys born in the wrong body became a woman who went through the surgery, let him use the women's room like why not? And if they're a bad person, judged that bad person on each individual basis. Now when you're talking about children, that's what people are scared of, that you know you're going to have some creep who pretends he's a woman so he can get in the girls room and he's gonna molest children. Like those are those worst case scenarios.

Speaker 5:          01:26:53       Yeah, those are terrible worst case scenarios, but what? How often is that going to happen? How do we protect that? How do we prevent that from happening? Those are the questions, but what for the vast majority of the people that become trans, do you really think that they're going to molest people? I don't think they are. You can't judge the vast majority based on a few. That's just like the same logic that says people shoot up people with guns, so we should take everyone's guns away. That's crazy to know. The vast majority of people with guns don't shoot people. The vast majority of people were trans. They don't want to hurt anybody. Then that's all they're trying to do is just get along and be who they are. This is a complex subject. At the end, the danger is when people are scared, they're scared or bullied into agreeing with one side of the other side because then then shit gets weird because then it becomes a battle but becomes a battle instead of an opportunity.

Speaker 5:          01:27:48       Yeah. Discussion and opportunity to. To enforce and encourage compassion like that. It can be done both ways. Yeah. I think the opera, but to look at these people like, look, they just hook. Why do you care if someone wants to be a girl? Why do you care if she wants to be a guy? Why do you care? Like let them do it. Let them be free. Let them be there themselves. Just like let it do tattoo his face. Let let what do whatever you want, man. As long as you're not fucking people over and you're not hurting people, you know out there robbing people and stealing from people and murdering people. As long as that's not happening. Do whatever you want. What should be our approach? This stuff that should be one of our. That should be someone in the bill of rights or something or a new what?

Speaker 5:          01:28:28       New. A new amendment should be something in there where we think about the why, why, why we have a problem, and how we address the problem. As soon as you address the problem of force, force forward is forced in return, you're going to get forced back. People are going to get, they're going to want to get ramped up just as much to attack you is. You attack them and then you going back and forth left and right and it becomes fucking chaos. And that's what we have right now. When you see the difference between Fox News and CNN and the right and the left and everybody digs their heels in bad. Fuck, it's, it's not, it's not helpful. It's not helpful. And there's also a bunch of people that profit off of this, this battle and dispute. Okay? No New York City did not just introduce it, $250,000, fine for any incorrect use of gender pronouns, but they did for some use of gender pronouns. I think the question

Speaker 8:          01:29:15       misinterpretation of a guideline that's already existed, uh, there was a blog post that got written in the New York Post reported on it. There was an updated or a change in the guidelines, but it's not supposed to be for like an incorrect or ms dot misuse of it. What is it supposed to be for harassment and discrimination and things like that.

Speaker 5:          01:29:33       Okay. So regardless of individual sex assigned at birth anatomy, gender, medical history, appearance or the sex indicated on the individual's identification. Okay. The raw requires employers and covered entities to use an individual's preferred name, Pronoun and title, Eg, Mrs. Or Mrs. Regardless of the individual sex assigned at birth. So that's it. Okay. These guidelines as noted by the commission can impose penalties of up to $250,000 for violations that are the result of willful, wanton or malicious conduct. So that seems like they're saying that it is true.

Speaker 8:          01:30:15       There are. That is. So there is a law, but there's a commission. It's not just like you can't just say it and someone's going to find you. It has to go through a long, lengthy court process and they're not just finding people like businesses and like.

Speaker 5:          01:30:27       Exactly. I get it still slippery. This is all going to. Can you imagine the GE? All this is going to do is create a ton of lawsuits. Yeah. Just because it's a commission like that that might even be worse that you're bringing it into. Like you have to sit in front of a bunch of experts who have to decide whether or not you. You missed gendered. Someone stop. Like, it's crazy. It's crazy to miss. Just look, if someone's an asshole, you're an asshole. Like what if, what if you're a Jew and someone calls you a Kike? Can they get fined $250,000. How does that work? Well, no. Right, but that's an offensive term for a Jewish person. Right. So if you, if you brought that to court, how would that work? I don't think you'd get people. It's commission though.

Speaker 8:          01:31:12       Yeah. That would be like a business being brought. They're not like just a person, right?

Speaker 5:          01:31:17       Yeah, like landlords. It was one of them that they brought up. Like if you decided that you will be Jamie still, but now you're jamming the woman. I'm like, the fuck Outta here, Jamie, you're a dude. GimMe my money, but it's like a wouldn't date

Speaker 8:          01:31:30       if that was the case it was and I wanted an apartment that you were offering and you wouldn't give me the apartment for that reason

Speaker 5:          01:31:36       or we work together in some sort of way and I'm discriminating against you at work. So it feel like so many. It just seems like a ground for so many lawsuits. What I find is if somebody is an addict to somebody, if somebody's calling somebody a name or something these days with so many camera phones and so many things, usually it gets brought up pretty quick. If somebody is racist these days, like really devout in their core

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       and they like it gets brought out pretty fucking quick. Not always though. Not always. I'm sure some people get away with it. Well, you know how you learn. You know how I learned like a in the area I grew up in not to be racist. You'd hear somebody say something to somebody else that they shouldn't say and they got their ass whooped and then they learn, not they. I mean it was a weird way to learn it, but you learned, you learned. It would be nice if people could learn another way to realize how stupid it is to just be racist. Yeah. There's plenty of ways you should judge individuals like based on their actions and what they've done, how they're treating other people, how you know whether or not they're doing things that are illegal or immoral or unethical. That's as an individual, but as soon as you're doing it based on where they can't control right there, what they're, what they look like, where they were born, what part of the world they're from.

Speaker 1:          01:32:52       That's just fucking stupid. It's just a stew. It's you're, you're, you're judging people on something. I have zero control over. You don't have any control of your color. That's crazy and yeah, there's people that are still doing that, that are still living in that space. Then it's. I mean, it is something that I think some of it will just take more time, but I think eventually something will be eradicated it. I think it's beige powers my thing. We're all going to be beige, Bro. You know what I'm saying? We're three January. Regeneration from all being based thing. So you don't know. No, not because of places like England and Scotland and Ireland where it's always rainy. You're going to just kinda get a massive amount of white people in those spots no matter what. There's no sun. Even White Brown people that moved there, five, six, seven generations in this type Pale enough. Brendan Schaub.

Speaker 1:          01:33:39       See he said he was from England. That's what it. Is. It really black dude from Manga? I don't think he does. He just forgets things. A black guy from England like 500 years ago, his whole fan was probably black and then over time, over time they just turned into white people. Just like every other person that moved to England, right? Every fucking human being came out of Africa. One hundred percent. That's the origin of the species. We came from Africa. We branched out into the world and we got to places like Scotland where it never fucking never sunny and we got bleached out. He believed God, they turned into like a solar panels for vitamin D at this to soak up that vitamin D. Yeah, because if you're black, like you have so much Melanin, Congo black, you got a dark skin color that's just awesome for sun, but it's terrible when there's no sun, like how are you getting your vitamin D dot?

Speaker 1:          01:34:30       Even if you hug a black person, I feel like your skin feels a little bit kind of like more moist. You know what I'm saying? They use cocoa butter. Remember ashy Larry? Oh Dude. We had to do in our neighborhood. His brothers set him on fire and his whole leg was asked. She just do booboo. Tyson and he is. Same thing. It's different kind of ashy along. Oh yeah, she's just dry skin, but sometimes I feel a little bit of African like in my course and I was a lay in bed at night and just pretend I was in Africa. She ever get your blood tested

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       to see what you are. Yeah. I didn't look at the results yet. We didn't look at the results and it scared. I'm. Maybe I'm a little bit nervous, but what you might be. I don't want to be French. That's what I don't want to be honest with you. I think your French French a little bit. Yeah. I think you've got 13 percent. Don't laugh about that. Jamie. How come you don't want to be French? I've all things. What's wrong with that? Why would that bother you? Even a little bit. Just they made great wine, great painters who crave wine. They complain a lot. Apparently they liked to fuck. Really? That's the word that French people just like to fuck and they think that the way we handle things is stupid. They have affairs like openly, publicly, the French, a little bit. Politicians, they of course they cheat.

Speaker 2:          01:35:44       They're all fucking animals over there. It just drew and that toxo plasma apparently was running rapid through France. Really? Is it toxo plasma is that thing that you get from cats? Get it and they get it from rats and it's a, it's a parasite that gets into human brains and it affects humans and it makes people a little bit more reckless. Like rabies kind of a light. No, not rabies. More like a, like slightly drunk all the time. And uh, this toxo plasma. Apparently there was one point in time 40 percent of the franchise of France was infected with toxo plasma. Yeah. See if you find that that's true. It must have been a fuck fest. I Beth fuck fest. Wild and loose. Yeah. You Got to pee. They think that there's a direct correlation between the high levels of infestation and the behavioral changes that the population in Pensacola, what?

Speaker 2:          01:36:37       Rats and stuff. No, of this talkshow plastic suppliers and probably 50 million people in this country have it. You get it from cat shit or from if you live in a farm, like you step on the field and it gets in your skin. Like maybe cats had been shitting all over the place, or a dog will eat something that you know, some cat shit, wouldn't you get shit and you're around the dog. Two thousand 12 analysis from France are an estimated 43 percent of the people carrying toxoplasmosis. Gandhi concluded that men with a latent infection tend to be more dogmatic, less confident, more jealous, less impulsive, and more orderly than infected men. Infected women seem warmer, more conscientious, more persistent, more insecure, and more sanctimonious. Whoa, dude. I'll get a six pack for the ladies then. Huh? That sounds crazy. Is that that 43 percent of people carry it? Jesus Christ. That's a large number of human beings infected by something that changes behavior or at least leads to trends that are different and and noticeable. More dogmatic, less confident, less confident is interesting that gone die. Toxoplasmosis gone die. Associations of having antibodies to the parasite with bipolar, suicidal

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       behavior, even optimistic disposition, possibly related to the parasites effect on dopamine. So it gets into your body and then you just have it for life. Oh Wow. Yeah, it is sexually transmitted. It must be. Then that's a good question. That's a very good question. I don't know if 43 percent of people have it. I can't imagine that half of the population to stepped on a, you know, fucking. Well, I think that's a good question. That's a good question. But I think there's a lot of feral cats around. Yeah. Oh, that's true. Yeah. I think when there's places like El Gato. Yeah. We got a lot of feral cats running around gratitude. They have that whole movie. But that animal, that was a chef. Yup. And what it does to the rats is that makes them get hard ons when they smell cat piss. Is that really?

Speaker 1:          01:38:37       Yup. It rewires their sexual reward system. So the testes in large, when they smell cat piss. No, they get hard. So it gets at a fucking. A neighbor like that dated. This guy will always with pregnancy. Say that again. It gets them through pregnancy to the child. Woof, woof. There you go. Know 43 percent is a high number. That's like, it's a lot of people. It's 43 out of 100 people do 3 billion people on the planet. Two billion people have it as 43 percent of those tested in that study and that's all the people that get tested. Who the fuck I've never been tested. You've been tested? No. How many of you have been tested? That's a rough estimate, man. They don't fucking know. I bet it's a lot higher. I bet. As a lot of people that have it. Yeah. Shit in the blood, dude.

Speaker 1:          01:39:23       I probably got it. We had a Dr Robert Sapolsky and the podcast. We did one with him. He's an expert in it and he's got a bunch of lectures and speeches on it and he said that when he was a resident then he heard about a guy who found out that a disproportionate number of motorcycle accidents were attributed to people that were on this toxo plasma. Really? Yeah. That they. That they got this infection and it was causing them to do stupid shit on motorcycles and crash. I would hate that man. It's hard enough to ride a motorcycle and then they have like, you know, just to be being led astray by rare disease in your brain one. And I wonder if it varies. Right? I wonder if the Toxoplasma that they get in Paris has the same exact response was the one that they get in South America.

Speaker 1:          01:40:08       The America. That is a bunch of variations. Yeah. Oh, see, that's what I'm talking about. There's different ones. A Long Island has a lot of Jesus Christ. There's different ones. Fuck, see, I bet the. What is this though? This seemed like. What is it? Well, it's parasites. Parasites, parasites exist in so many animals. They hitch rides and then that's their ecosystem. Our ecosystem is to be on planet earth. Their ecosystem is to be in planet feel Vaughn and they just get inside of you. Have parasites ever changed? Like the kind of the course of history? Is that what happened with the plague or is that a different thing? No, the plagues a different thing, but they probably could change the course of history. Have they really changed that many people's behavior? If you think about Paris or France, they're talking about 43 percent of the people have this infection and the irony of parasites.

Speaker 1:          01:40:59       How crazy is that? That's crazy. It's Paris site. What if they have. Could you imagine a little French fucking berets? We Lee. I'm going to change your behavior a little. You'll go to stupid American. The craziest one man is this aquatic worm. It climbs inside of grasshoppers. Body grows and the grasshoppers body, and then it tells the grasshopper to commit suicide. Oh my God. So it gets the grasshopper to jump into the water and then once the grasshopper gets in the water, then it bursts out of its body. Oh, it's like Pinocchio meets. I'm alien. Have you seen the movie alien? Sigourney weaver. It is like Pinocchio. It's like the bottom of the whale, right in the belly of the whale. Yeah. That movie alien with Sigourney Weaver. Probably my favorite science fiction movie of all time. Oh really? Yeah. I would say if I had to pick one science fiction horror movie that was like the one.

Speaker 1:          01:41:56       I'll say that alien. It's kind of cornball. When you watched the special effects now though? Yeah. Not as scary. Yeah. There's some space stuff that you like, oh, okay. This is 1978. Forget different times and even 1980 man, you know, it's a corny. That's crazy. Hot hades or being tall and she had curly hair. I remember thinking I'm strong. Confident. Sexy. Yes. You were fucking neck like you think you couldn't choke her out? Yeah. Like if she was. She was such a powerful woman. Like this isn't a woman that needs a man. She liked you. It's like, oh. She's like, I'm worthy. I'm worthy of her. Like she drove a van, but because she had fucking business to do. Yeah. I think we should have like an old land cruiser. Look at Toyota. FJ 41 of those ones. Yeah. She'd be like an archeologist or some shit, right?

Speaker 1:          01:42:44       Yeah. She had a fucking pickax and what? She was in Avatar. Right in. What is this? Oh, that's the alien. Took it that. That's too. Is that a raccoon? What does that. So it's a kid. This little kid hanging onto her bro. I love that. That was alien. Alien Two's not my favorite because it was like, wait a minute, why is it so easy to kill them all of a sudden, so easy to kill them because there's so many of them. Like alien one. That fucking thing was like it was thinking it was. It was. It was ahead of you every step of the way. Alien too. They just became like clumsy and bumbling and shoot them and then there's another one around the corner. Shoot that one too. It's like, okay. Did I remember a Arachnophobia had me shook. Remember that one when the spider has gotten that duplex, brother shook me to the core to see this one is like way deep into the future.

Speaker 1:          01:43:32       Like the first one was in the seventies, [inaudible] and they're still doing them now. That's what's crazy. To ready to bang out new alien movies. Now the Predator coming out, they'd have a new Predator coming up. They do hilarious. Why not make some money? Yeah, that's true. That kind of stuff is fun. It's probably fun. I can't believe Brennan. Siobhan, Italian. Would you say it was British English? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. That came from Africa through England a thousand years ago. His people did. Oh, I know. Over time. White. That's why they call him big brown. Oh really? No. Just made all that. Oh Dang. I was going on here. I thought he seemed like he seemed pretty white to me when I see a giant white dude. Yeah. He loved. He always has. He as the best disposition doesn't break. He just loves to laugh. Do you can take it out on.

Speaker 1:          01:44:22       He just hated on dudes. Get Jealous. Do you ever get jealous? But do you think. And also he says stupid shit sometimes, but do you think he feels that he. I feel like he has a special gift where you can kind of, especially if you're a buddy, like you can kind of joke with him and he loved, like he just, he knows that you love him. You know he's a great guy. He brushes it off. He's got a great attitude. Like if more people had his attitude about dealing with life's problems, we'd have a happier world. He knows how to let things roll right off his back. He's big. He's a smart guy, man. I always like being around him. Yeah, man. He gets a lot of hate online. It's interesting. Yeah, I think it, but I think as guys that are jealous because when I go on the road like I just went to Bakersfield recently, which is.

Speaker 1:          01:45:02       Can we just say it's like the best people ever came out there. Feels fucking amazing. I felt like I felt like hulk Hogan Bro. People came out. People were crying, someone's sacrifice, their cousins. Some guy came out of the closet like all they wanted it all to happen at the show. You know? People were giving me recipes. People were donating blood thing. Man, it ain't that far. It's an hour and a half hour and 40 minutes. How long does it take to get to Bakersfield from ela? Two hours. Two hours Max. It should be the new capital, Bro. It's not a bad spot. And the people are Super Nice. Pretty diverse. I mean, yeah, it was cool, man. I really liked it. Although I did turn my sink on. It's Brown. Shit was fucking flying out of the sink. I was like, what the fuck is this? I've made an instagram video of it. I was like, Bakersfield, what the fuck is going on with your water man? To say good, because you know their high school, their mascot. It's called the drillers. The team name because they're oil drillers. Do you know that that whole area is where there will be blood that no. Daniel Day, Lewis Lewis movie. I love that guy. That's an amazing movie too. So good that there will be blood is about that whole area. That's where there's apparently. Look at that. Is My water coming out of my fucking sick. Did you drink any? Oh yeah, dude.

Speaker 1:          01:46:27       Crazy noises out brown water and the word says you already brushed your teeth. That's the crazy part too. I hate when that happens because you don't know it first. Ooh, it's funky. Definitely seems like a malt, but I think that I was staying at our super old hotel, like real from the 18 hundreds. They like redid it downtown. Yeah. What is it called? I think it might have stayed at the ace hotel, the NSA Godrej. I didn't tell people where I stood because I didn't want to be mean to the hotel. The Padre hotel. I think of this as the old place. Yes. I think that's it. I think it was nice. Had a nice. It was nice in there. It was nice restaurant. Elevator. Yeah. Yeah, but it's just. They got some old ass pipes. Clean those pipes on. Something is going wrong and I was staying there.

Speaker 1:          01:47:16       So what if. What if I took a mouthful that drank it? What did he died? What if I was just shitting all over myself for the rest of the day and I had to cancel my shows. Oh, how about that? People would be furious. Angry. Rightly so. They shouldn't be furious. Do. Do you think you'll die one day or not? I'm not trying to make you think about it. I'm pretty sure that's how the world. That's how the road goes. Yeah. You're born and then you die. What? What do you think? Don't know man. Crush it. Doesn't think you die. Yeah. Yeah. I think. I think he's just drunk. Yeah, that could be it too. You didn't have a shirt on, dude, you get to put a shirt on and decide if you're going to die or. No, he goes, prove it, prove it. Oh boy.

Speaker 1:          01:47:58       We have to base this on what we know about people now. I know the people you used to be alive and now they're not. So what happened to them? Are they faking it? You know, like you. Will you be sad if you die, you think? I think I'll be dead, Bro. Yeah. What about you? I'd be sad if you died. Oh, thank you. I'd be sad if you died too. Thanks man. Um, I would be worried about the end of your life. Yeah, I worry about him in a sense. It makes you really wonder then what, what is my time mean? What does your timing like? What's important to you in this life right now? Um, I think probably being, just feeling more okay with myself probably and trying to have maybe help other people being more okay with yourself. Like what? What bothers you about yourself? Uh, I just wish I just felt more comfortable in my own skin a lot of times, you know, because I feel like I'm be able to be more effective as a person if I could just kind of get not toil in some of my own, you know, the small self worth issues or like lack of confidence at times, you know, I wish I could trust my instincts and I wish my instincts were like better calibrated so that I knew when I was what if I was doing like, okay, in good stuff, then my insides like told me, you're being okay.

Speaker 1:          01:49:17       You don't have to worry. You know, there's a lot of things going on there, right? One of them, the big one is almost always from your childhood, almost feelings of lack of worth and self worth come from that feeling as you're developing, as you're growing up. Yeah. Feel like you're not loved or you're not appreciated or you're, you're criticized too much. You feel like you're a loser and really be concise. Psychologically can be very hard to shake. And even as people get older, they still,

Speaker 2:          01:49:48       they still cling to this thought that they're a piece of shit because they are a piece of shit in someone's eyes when they were eight or 10. That's a real problem with people, man. And that's one of the reasons why when someone gets bullied when they're young, it can be so devastating because it's happening when you're in high school or junior high school and it becomes a defining moment for you. Yet I was scared as one kid really also about this one kid, one of the reasons why I got into wrestling this kid, uh, like we had this confrontation and a locker room and I didn't think were going to fight. Like I was just totally bluffing. I don't know what, what I said or what he said, I don't remember. But I do remember him getting me in a headlock, throwing me on the ground and then leaning like he was gonna Punch me in the face.

Speaker 2:          01:50:37       But deciding not to and I didn't know what to do. I had no, no martial arts skills. No nothing. I haven't. I'd never wrestled anybody before. I didn't know anything, so there's nothing in you that is like a new reaction, panicked and no idea what to do. And I think and I thought, shit, I didn't think he was going to do that and now here I am on my back. I'm traveling, God dammit. I got to learn how to wrestle. I got to learn some martial arts or something. So then I started taking karate and then I started taking wrestling like right after that. But I avoided that kid every time I saw him. When I see him on the other side of school, it looks through the breezeway and I've always knew where he was around. I got to go around. I don't want to see that guy that threw me on the ground and could have punched me in the face.

Speaker 2:          01:51:20       It was almost like more humiliating that he did, could have punched me in the face, but he didn't. But that bullying and that guy doing that, to me, that fear of like being I'm just helpless, made me get into martial arts. I was like, fuck this. Like I gotta figure out how to fight. I don't want this to happen to me anymore to do you see as the benefit. It was a lucky situation to look. He didn't beat me up. It could've been way worse. It was not that big a deal. It was an easy school to go to. Like my school wasn't hard. Even though there was some criminals that were in that school, like some kids that get shipped into. There was some bad kids and one of them got charged with murder, like right after graduating. We were like, whoa. Our friend Kevin, we knew this dude and he killed somebody, but like, whoa.

Speaker 2:          01:52:04       Yeah. Everybody was like, whoa. That guy killed somebody. I think he was one year older than me. Yeah. He murdered somebody like right after high school. Yeah, there's a kid. We knew he was on the football team. We knew him. And then do you ever think he would murder somebody? He was a tough guy. He's a scary guy for sure. Like a powerhouse of a person, like a tank. I didn't know him well though, but I, you know, I'd say hi to them, but it's one of those things where when something like that happens to you and for me again, it was very minor, just I was just scared of this guy now he didn't do anything to me. Horrible. Just threw me on the ground. So when somebody's going to beat your brains, I mean if somebody could hold you down like that I could do, could have beat my face and I wouldn't have been able to do shit.

Speaker 2:          01:52:44       Are you grateful in a weird way that he didn't or not grateful? Looking back on her for sure, but it was enough. He just let me know. I was, you know, I don't know what I said. I'm in a said something stupid. He might've said something stupid and wanted me to back down and I didn't. So he just grabbed me, threw me on the ground. But the fact that he, that he did it and could do it led me to make one of the biggest decisions of my whole life is getting involved in martial arts. I just didn't want that feeling anymore of like if someone talks like gives me a hard time, I want to be the one who can decide whether or not this gets violent or who gets hurt. I don't want to leave that into some stranger's hand, so it might be a fucking psychopath if it's in my hands.

Speaker 2:          01:53:24       No one's getting hurt. We're going to be finally, there's a video of Matt Serra from yesterday. Matt Serra, there was a drunk and altercation with some fucking dude in a food court. Matt Serra who is a Brazilian Jujitsu black belt, who at one point in time when he was competing, he was one of the best presented to to artists in the world. Then on top of that, he fought mma, knocked out George St. Pierre won the welterweight title and he's got some dude on the ground and he's just saying, calm down, calm down because I'm gonna fuck you up. I'm going to fuck. But it's hilarious to watch like, look at this look good, play good and play the volume.

Speaker 9:          01:54:00       He's like, I'm going to break your fucking face. He's holding his wrist. I love how you have the shirt on the guy's face. He's like, calm down, calm down. It's like he's putting a crying baby to sleep, and so the security guard comes over and says, let him go. He goes, okay, you're going to control them. You going to control them. Are you going to control knowing that? Are you ready to control them? Like he's not standing up and he's fat? I'll tell

Speaker 2:          01:54:42       you something. Mad. Sarah's one of the nicest fucking guys on the planet earth. If he has to do this to you in a restaurant and she's a restaurant, he's got full mount on you. You fucked up. You fucked up dude. But see, you're way better off with Matt Serra in that position. Then that drunk dude on some guy who doesn't know how to fight. It could be that too. That drunk dude could just be a real mean violent person who wants to beat someone up if he gets him down. So if there's guys like you who aren't into that. So you found getting into martial arts, I really kind of lead you in a way where you felt more confident in case things got into an uncomfortable situation that you would be okay. Yeah. Well look, you're always. You're always going to be nervous in life when something's important, whether it's going on stage or something difficult to do. Difficult things make you nervous. It's like there's an anticipation. There's an understanding of the difficulty of something you're about to pursue and whether or not you're going to fall short or whether or not you're going to succeed. That shit makes people nervous, but the physical confrontation, nervousness is a bad one. That's like dad is

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       a paralyzing fear when the fear of being bullied or being hurt and you can't do anything about it. That devastates people, that puts them in a deep, deep depression. So it's really important to I think. I think every young man should learn how to fight. I think there would be way less fights because of it and I don't think you have to be a mean person to learn martial arts. I think it's a skill and I think you learn it and then once you start getting good at it, it started actually starts actually becoming fun and the people who practice it with you, you become close with you, don't. You don't hate the people that you're practicing fighting with. They become some of your closest friends and I think it's just a big. It's a giant confidence boost to know that you can do something difficult and get better at it.

Speaker 5:          01:56:28       That's, I think, just that alone. It has massive benefits for people. Yeah, you know, I can sense that meant I remember watching a video a couple years ago actually if you like getting a belt or something, they gave you a, some Dojo or I'm not sure what the correct terminology is. It might've been probably watching when I got my black belt. Yeah, maybe that was it. But anyway. Yeah, like all, like there was a lot of guys around just. And I know that Coco does it, Joe, he does it. He loves it and he said, why don't you do it? You're a strapping man. You talked to Eddie about going to do it one day, do it, so he said, uh, he said, yeah, he said, come down one day and he'll, you know, get me into like, one of the beginners classes. I think I need to do it.

Speaker 5:          01:57:04       Fuck yeah. Could make me feel a little bit more, um, know, like you said, some of them that just a, I don't know, some. And especially like if people get bullied and then they don't have like a brother or they don't have a friend or they don't even have somebody to go talk to, to be like, oh man. And then their blooded, he'd be like, oh, it's okay. You know, like that seat that's, that can make you know. Then that person gets stuck inside themselves just feeling like, you know, like they're not going to be okay. No, no. It's terrifying. And then everywhere you go, you're, you're just scared of running into this guy. Yeah, very, very, very bad. You know, she'd get into tenements, do it. It's a fucking natural animal inclination to pick on the weak, you know, only humans realize it and stop it.

Speaker 5:          01:57:48       And actually tell people not to do it and understand the effect that it has on the people that do it, but every animal does it. Dogs do it, chickens do it. Chickens have a pecking order. They fuck with one chicken and then they all decided, oh, let's fuck with this bitch. And they all attack her for no reason. It's weird man. And you've seen it. Everybody's seen dogs do it. One dog will blow up and the other dog, the dog will cower. And then they decided the pecking order. I mean, and then that dog will always go near that dog and fuck with them and growl at them. Maybe bite his year or something like that. Yeah, it's a weird thing that animals figured out how to make sure that the only ones that get to breed are the ones that are confident and powerful and can overcome problems.

Speaker 5:          01:58:28       Okay. And one of the problems is other mating viable males that want to meet with the women that you want to meet with, like with this fucking giraffe. They wound up killing those three other drafts. This guy just was like, fuck these bitches coming up. I'm going to smash my head into these drafts. Stop them. You ain't fucking these girls when you get older. Fuck you bitch, and this is just a natural inclination that animals have to find the weak and force it out and we don't have it. Well we do. We did have it. Fortunately we haven't less now. I said, well, we realize because of communication, right? We realized that there's devastating effects in this. Then we have loving and caring communities and we have compassion that you shouldn't do that, but there's an inclination that people have to pick on the weak and attack the weak.

Speaker 5:          01:59:13       It's very. It's very disturbing, but it's also very logical in terms of like biology, right? We're trying to make it difficult for males to breed. It's not like we have very few people and we're trying to make as many people as we get. No, no, no. It's like the highest status mails and the dominant males are competing against these other males in order to be able to breed with, you know, whatever lizards are fucking wolves or any, any in any species. The high status male wolf is the one who gets to breed with the the choice females and this is how they're carrying their genes on. It happens in deer, it happens in elk, it happens in all these different animals and they fight. I mean the reason why these, these antlers. Elk. Yeah. Those are for fighting. That's all there for. They actually lose those fucking things.

Speaker 5:          02:00:05       After they're done breeding, really. They fall off and they grow back again the next year. That is the fastest body part growth known to man is elk antlers and that, I mean when you look at those, it looks like it would take 70 years to grow the grow those motherfuckers at a couple of months and then it'll grow bigger next year up until a point, sometime around like age nine or 10. Sometimes they taper off and they start to decline. As they get older, their their antlers actually become smaller and smaller, but for the most part as the. That's one of the reasons why people want to shoot a big male is because that male with big antlers, that male spread his genetics for many, many years. So his genes are will long passed on. He's probably a bread with dozens of females. Oh, I see. So if it has a, it's obviously been alive a long time and it has that family treat is hanging out of the front of its head.

Speaker 5:          02:00:54       Exactly. And you know, okay, this thing is already. It's already prospered. Yeah. And the idea also is that to only shoot those mails, those, those high status, big males, it's actually better for the population because then the younger males get a chance to become older because they'll kill them. They killed young males. If a young male gets fucking frisky and he thinks he's a bad ass, the big old bowl, fuck him up. And one of the ways they fuck them up as their antlers are longer so they can get the young one when the young one can't get him. Nothing Ms Dot Kinda Kinda evil, but your, your weapons are dictated by your age. It's really weird, right? And your strength and like how, how, how much vitality you have. That's what grows your antlers out in that. Fascinating that. That's how it all

Speaker 2:          02:01:40       that it's all put together like that. It is fucked up and they bullied the shit out of those young bowls. They chase them away. You get no pussy. Those, those young bulls are, they call them satellite bowls there. So horny. Are they hanging on the outside of the blues? That's why they're susceptible to hunters because hunters like make a cow calling. They make this go like, hey, who wants to fuck one to fuck? And then they get shot. Yeah. So they get. That's one of the things about elk hunting that's so interesting, so that you call them in actually make sounds to try to bring them towards you. So they think they're going to get some pussy or they think there's a fight. That's the other thing you do. You make a bugle and they have these horns, you blow bugles and then the, the elk will go, what?

Speaker 2:          02:02:24       You want someone to bitch and I'll come around the corner for. Yeah, looking for another elk to fuck up and then shoot them. Would you ever get in like a suit or anything like that into it and pretend to be an l, like sneak up on them. They have actual, uh, elk decoys that they use that they actually put on the front of the bow. So like say if you were shooting your bow right, you've got your bow here. Extending in front of your bow is like a, an it looks like, like, like a female elk. It's like a deep. And you're actually shooting through her at the ELC. Oh, it's like a decor that you put on in front of your boat. You're drawing back your bow. We got something here. It's like a pocket pussy but with a weapon in it. Elk Buhner that boy, what is this?

Speaker 2:          02:03:10       That is weird. Popped up when I typed it out. It's a new product. What does it say? Adjustable fit ball cap. So what is that mask? It's an l k. that's a good way to get shot by a dude. Oh, it's a good point. One of those on a one off to. Oh, so that's what. That is what it is. It's like an elk head, you know, has one of those. John Dudley has something like that. It's like here's your. Where's your chicken? Or tricking him looking girl filter. That's what you look like. I don't think their vision is very good. Oh, I see. I think their vision is a. have you ever watched any of them have sex or they don't? Yeah. Yeah, I saw one of them. I saw a male, a elk fuck a female. It was crazy. Really? Is it pretty cool or is it mashed?

Speaker 2:          02:03:52       It. He smashed it so hard. She went flying forward when she got tackled and went down to a front knees. Dan, he just climbed on top and he's a one pump chump. Boom. He just slammed into it. Could you tell? He felt good after it. He seemed like whatever. He was screaming when they're fucking and when they're in heat, in the breeding, in the Rut they call it. It's amazing to watch. I mean, this is something they only do once a year, so for 11 months out of the year, they're cool with each other. They're all just hanging out together and one month out of the year to chaos, just fighting to the death with other males smashing into it and then every girl they get a chance, they bang it out and then when it's over it's over. And then this is a cycle of life and then in the spring the new calves are born and then they grow up and then a year later they're hanging around in the pack and then they get older as they get older. The challenge, the old bowl for dominance and chases them away and yeah, it's, it's a fascinating sort of a ecosystem when you want. And then you know, there's always rules and there's always bears and there's all these things are trying to eat them and mountain lions are killing them. It's amazing.

Speaker 6:          02:05:04       That's wild man. It's neat that you're so in tune with all of that stuff and that you, you know, you're into those worlds. That sounds like a lot of fun, you know? Well,

Speaker 2:          02:05:14       it's really interesting. Even if I never ever hunted again, um, I would still be fascinated by wildlife. It is just, it's one of the more interesting things about being alive. There's these other things that are alive too, and they're nothing like us. They are nothing like us. We're the outliers really. Oh, for sure. For sure. But we're the ones who are separated from them so completely that if we see one, it's like a bird sitting on a flag pole or it's, you know, it's fucking coyote and your neighborhood. Whoa. What's he doing here? You know, like the, or a dog, which is like our friend, you know, dot. I don't even count them as animals. I know they're animals, but they're our friends. It's like when you have dogs, either they're dependent upon us for food. They're part of the family. It's a totally different deal than like a pet wolf or a pet bear or some shit.

Speaker 6:          02:06:04       There's an episode where somebody's dog plays family feud with them, know what I'm saying? So that's A. Yeah, you what other animals going to do that?

Speaker 2:          02:06:13       I saw a dude online who had talked is he trained his dog to get him a beer and he put a t. He tied a towel to the door of the refrigerator. You'd say, go get me a beer, and the dog would go there. She would grab a hold of towel, pull on it. It would open up the door to the fridge, should reach in, grab a can of beer, run over hand the can of beer to him. He'd say, good now. Go close the door. And she would go close the door. She would go grab that towel and use it to shut that door. I was like, that is insane. That is a super trained animal, man.

Speaker 6:          02:06:46       Yeah. I never had a dog. I knew we were talking last night at the company or about your dog and you, you, you know, you guys always seem to be super happy. Like, uh, when y'all go running and everything we're talking about, it's cool. Do you, uh, ever have any pets? No, I never had any pets. They were grown up a lot of responsibility. They had scary dogs, like they had loose dogs and our neighborhoods like rottweilers, Dobermans, you know, so it was like, it wasn't. Nobody had a pet like everybody had, like there were two dogs that were like, fuck, you know, you'd see him fucking and sometimes like attack. So it was kind of exciting, but it wasn't like. And then a lot of animals got hit by my house by this highway by trucks and so we'd go bury the animals sometimes. Oh really? Yeah. So we'd go get the animal, you know, pull them right off this little highway and Barium. But um, but yeah, I never had a pet, but I would like to have one if I can get a home one time, you know, a home, a wife and stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       And I think I would like to have an animal. You know, they're fun man, but you gotta really know what you're getting into. If you go out of town, you're going to need somebody to watch it, feed it and take care of it, get that going to make sure you have a big enough yard where your dog and get some exercise and they're going to shit all over the place. You're going to have to learn how you pick that up. You're gonna have to pick that shit up, you know? Can you teach them to shit and like a hole or something? Nope. Nope. They shit. Wherever they go outside, they just find a spot and say this is a good spot to shit and they just dropped logs and then you got logs all over your lawn and if you go two days without cleaning those logs and you got eight logs and pick up and have three dogs show logos so dogs makes nutro logs, logs.

Speaker 1:          02:08:28       You got to go around cleaning it up and if I don't clean it up, I'll have that fucking smell going to be out in the yard. Like shit's mouse and you got to get the scraper, little scraper and scrape the logs. And the. I have a place I'd dump them into. Yeah, it's nasty. Scooping up shit. Imagine if your grandma just shit all over your yard. Just go out. Go out in the lawn. Just shits in the yard, shits on the lawn like grandmas out there. Shit. I got to clean up or shit. I love her. But God, I hate cleaning her shit. Ya'll would hate cleaning up probably human shit for some reason. But I remember them dog shit. Well, when I was a kid that had a blend or neighborhood named Mario, right? And He, uh, and he was dude, he ended up dying actually.

Speaker 1:          02:09:10       He did some pills and drove into an embankment, but he, when I was young he would shit in his yard, make me bury it. And that's how, that's how I was allowed to be friends with him. How did he make you bury it? He just asked me to do it and I was afraid not to do it. I said, Yo Dude, you're not going to believe this, but I took a shit. And in my yard I can't even bury it because I'll throw up. Hey, do me a favor and go bury it. Yeah, he was, he did. He was dark man. He had a, he had a real dark vision and he would, uh, he would, I mean he probably honestly, dude, he probably shit 200, 300 times and I buried it. I swear to God on, I swear to God, I swear to God dude.

Speaker 1:          02:09:48       And He um, had to not run out of places to make new holes. Did you think you ever dug up old shit to put in new shit? Oh yeah. I wouldn't be surprised man. We basically had like the only setup, I had not even have a strong system. The only setup, I was like one of those plastic. A beach. Oh no setup. I was seven. So wait a minute. This seven year old was doing this. How old was he? He was eight or nine. Oh, he's tricking you buy an older. He was older and two years when you're seven is a long stretch now when you 32, 30 2:34, that don't mean shit. Whatever. Dude. Seven and nine. That's a big stretch. Yeah. You go shit. At your house, Buddy. That's what I tell people now. For too long he would. What was the, do you remember the first?

Speaker 1:          02:10:30       There's no way. You really remember. I remember what, I don't remember what he said, but I remember. How did it happen? How did it happen when you find yourself with a plastic shovel and another person? Shit going down. How did it come to this? Well, it came to it because he, I know my brother probably wasn't around and I wanted somebody to play with and he was older so I was hanging out and he was deviant man. How? So? He just had a little bit of like, um, like he was kind of slithering, you know what I'm talking about from mom. He knew how to manipulate you. Yeah. He was obviously burgers. Shit. 200 plus times. Like there wasn't here. The same color on the outside of design. The inside of his. It took them about demon. Yeah, like a light day. Diablo? Yeah, like an ld below.

Speaker 1:          02:11:12       But also who was an elementary school. Interesting. Um, but he, uh, so when you first found yourself, do you remember the feeling that you first found when you were digging a hole for a dude? Shit. Like, just thinking, what am I? How long can I do this? What if he keeps asking, how do I stop this? How did you wind up stopping? That's maybe a better question. You know what? I don't remember how it kind of, you know, pat, you know how he turned off? Yeah, petered off. I don't remember how it kind of tapered off to his parents ever. Like, Hey, do you ever shit in the house? How come we don't have any missing toilet paper? Well, did you know that's what I think it was. I think he was lazy. He was serious and he shut outside behind his slide. They had a slide in his yard because they had, you know, a little bit of money and he shot outside behind the slot is a great word too, by the way.

Speaker 1:          02:12:00       And it was silty kind of soil and sand. And I remember going over then I still remember, I don't remember the shade of it honestly. Would it look like, I would say like a tope, but a little with a little more brown and you can always find coyote shit because it has like little berries in it. A lot of times coyotes eat all kinds of things. Yeah. Yeah. Eat some berries. Sometimes I'll see these logs, like these little red berries in and I'm like, Oh God, Shit. It's always a dark brown to their shit's super consistent. It's weird. Goose has have fancy shit sometimes I see him. You mean disgusting? Yeah. I never liked it, but it seems creatures. Yeah, and that's a bait and switch by mother nature because if you see a goose you think, oh, this is fun, this can be exciting, and then they'll fucking choke out an infant at a park.

Speaker 1:          02:12:46       I mean gooses are violent. They're violent, extremely violent, and they, they, they fight impacts, impacts where they do. I have a friend who had a house on a lake and they had a wire all around the lake. I was like, what's the wire for delegates to keep the goose from going into the water? They don't want them to waddle and into the water of the things. I was like, is that electric? Like what kind of fence is that? I'm not sure if they. I'm not sure if it's electric. It might give them a little shock, but the idea was to try to keep the. Because they shit all over their lawn. The shit all over near where the. They had a pond in their yard. They're looks like the ultimate, like the Kid Marissa, just like that kid Mario. But a bird. Bollinger you and have a pond in your

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       yard. Like you want to go fishing? Yeah, let's take five steps out of my backyard. You know? I mean that is like the ultimate, but I don't think that's it. I don't think if you have a natural hill in new yard kind of. I don't think that's that expensive to get water would it? And to get a pump put in. I don't think it's that drastic man. I would think that'd be a nightmare, but they're going to make sure it doesn't leak like you had. I'm like, what's going to keep the water there? It takes a special kind of bottom, like when you go to a natural lake, like that's the water is pulled up there for a reason. Like that's an unusual ground. You got to realize if you're looking at a natural leg, unless it's a glacial lake, waters decide to stay there.

Speaker 2:          02:14:13       Whereas the same amount of water's probably landed everywhere, but it's decided to stay there. So what the hell is different between that ground and all the other ground around it. So when you want to make a pond, you just can't make a pond everywhere. There's a reason why there's not a pond there because that's not the kind of ground for a pond. So they would have to put a liner in. Ah, you got to teen mother. It's like taming mother nature almost. You have to do something. You can't just pour water in there and you've got to do something. And one of the things that they do in a lot of places, they use this really thick Koi pond liner. It's basically a plastic liner. So you got a bullshit ass fake pond is what you got that's going to look shitty. Go above ground pool.

Speaker 2:          02:14:48       Yeah. No, basically the above ground pool of ponds. It's not even organized, you know? Well, once they get the liner in place, then they put surface levels of dirt and rocks and stuff over the line or. So it looks like a regular pond, but the thing is what's holding the water in place in some places they, they'll use those Koi pond you ever seen? You know what a coin. It's big. Beautiful. At a restaurant. Yeah. They have very thick liner that they used for the base of that Shit. Used that stuff on float tanks to flotation tanks. We floated them. Uh Nah. I mean I've heard you talk about it before. The liner of those things is the same thing. It's Koi pond, like a liner. It's like a real thick, durable, tough plastic. Does it feel like you're alive when you're in the tank?

Speaker 2:          02:15:36       Yeah. It feels like you're relaxing. You know, it's a good feeling. It feels good on your body. It just alleviates tension, but it also feels like you're in this meditative state. You relax and you think about things better. There you get a good, good thought of, you know, what, how you, how to look at things from an outside looking in perspective. Yeah. You get a chance to be away from your body really because you're not thinking about your body just floating. Oh, I like that. You're not feeling your body at all. The water is the same temperature as your skin, so you don't. You can't even tell where the water is and where the, where your body is. So I like that. Yeah. I just feel like you're flying through the air and it's all dark and you don't see anything. You don't hear anything because your ears are underwater.

Speaker 2:          02:16:17       Does it feel dead? Do you feel like might be dead or not? No, definitely not. I like that he worried about the feeling of dead. I'm just worried about how does the fizz. Any like does your brain keep going, you know, or whatever it is. That keeps us going in our. Like when you die, he like, does our consciousness, does it just leave out of this shell and then we're just part of this straight up fucking. I think part of the thing is when we're thinking about consciousness, we're thinking about language, so we're thinking about the way we talk and think about a feeling. Yeah, because I think what we think of as consciousness, when I think of it, when my own limited mind, when I think of consciousness, I think of consciousness as me using language to interpret how I feel about different things.

Speaker 2:          02:16:59       I have this a language touch to it. I think if something happens when you die in your soul goes to another place. Let's say a soul as a real thing or consciousness, a real thing. I bet it goes there with no language and I bet that's real similar. I bet to what it feels like when you're really tripping, when you're on some heavy psychedelics and you just melt into the universe and you. You sort of ceased to exist on some of them, like five Meo dmt been, yeah, melt into the center of the universe. You feel like you don't exist anymore. I bet death and that feels like you're dying to. That's. That's a scary one. Five. MEO DMT is a universally disturbing one. Lot of people have problem with that one because it really does feel like you're dying. Can senior citizens do it or not?

Speaker 2:          02:17:48       I think they can. Yeah. I think the. The only problem would be if you had a heart attack freaked out. I'm think it's toxic because your body makes it. Your body knows what to do with it too. You know your body knows how to bring you back down to sobriety levels in like 15, 20 minutes. Do you know when you're going into those kinds of, when you're ill and some of that, do you get a feeling that if you're a good or bad person, did you get. Do you get like an ant that like I'm trying to get a feeling if there's things that are bothering you about your behavior. You know, if you're a. If you have something that's that's haunting you and maybe with a lot of people it really comes down to life choices, not just in terms of like their behavior, but even like what they're doing with for living and how they're living their life and sometimes those experiences.

Speaker 2:          02:18:35       The psychedelic experiences can highlight these things that are bothering you, but that you're suppressing and then you realize like, oh, this a suppressing of these feelings and thoughts is actually making me lash out in these other ways and I've got shitty behavior and aggressive in this way and it's really because of this lab. It's really because of. And then you might, you know, might also come to realization. It's about something that happened when you were a child. It's about feeling unprotected or unloved as a child and it's just, you never developed properly, so you never felt totally secure. So you want to do something to make you feel secure, whether it's drinking or something. And then you'll see that in a psychedelic experience, you'd be able to like see the root of it better. Oh Wow. For a lot of people its cessation of um, uh, of smoking comes from that feeling like, oh, this is killing myself because I hate myself.

Speaker 2:          02:19:30       Like I'm, I'm, I'm literally poisoning myself. Like how could I not see this? And then through having a mushroom experience, they've just completely quit. Really. So yeah, it's a real common one, real common ones. There's a lot of other stuff that I haven't done that also like Ibogaine is a big one for getting people off drugs. That's a huge one. I heard about that. That's a big one that has an amazing success rate, but it's supposed to be really brutal. And as far as like how you feel like look it, it runs you through the ringer psychologically, but when you get through it it's worth it. But it's 24 hours. Fuck. And who do you have to go with by yourself? So there's a lot of clinics that do it, particularly in Mexico. A lot of people go down to Mexico and go to these clinics and their 24 hour clinics of this Ibogaine experience.

Speaker 2:          02:20:17       Jre field trip. But Hey man, if you had a son and if you like Joe, my son is hooked on oxygen, I don't know what to do. I would 100 percent recommend you do that. Really? Yeah. Because I know so many people that have done it and it's helped them and it rewires the way your brain connects to addiction. It's really fast. It's a fascinating drug. Hamilton Morris, who is the host of vices, Hamilton's Pharmacopia. It's a essentially a show that's all just about drugs. He was talking about it last week about how fascinating it is and in low doses that actually is like a nootropic. It actually enhances your consciousness and low doses makes you smarter. Yeah. Uh, yeah. Uh, you know, uh, I want to get into some of that kind of stuff, but I mean, I, you know, so right now I don't party or anything like that, so I struggle with that.

Speaker 2:          02:21:02       It's like, man, you know, because I don't, you know, it's tough because I do want to be able to be, do things that are beneficial for myself and things that I didn't have a problem with, but it's hard just hard to kind of balance. Yeah. You want to stay sober. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, sobriety is a worthwhile goal and if you can go from being a person who's doing a lot of drugs and ruining their life, the person who is like yourself that's on a great path and you're sober and you're disciplined, you wouldn't want to break that. You don't want to have that bad feeling. Um, but there's ways that you can achieve certain psychedelic states, uh, without any drugs. One of the big ones is yoga and meditation. Those are two big ones. Yeah. I mean, I don't do the kind of yoga that gives you a psychedelic experience.

Speaker 2:          02:21:48       I think mostly that's Kundalini Yoga, but the kind of yoga that I do, um, that beaker from hot yoga shit, it's just this, this what it does to your body and chills you out afterwards. I think it has a pretty profound effect on the way the world, the way you experience the world after the classes. So I think that's something that people don't take into consideration. Like one way in which you can change the world around you is to change how you interface with the world and how you experience the world. How are you viewing it? What is your, what's your behavior of a flavored by? Is your behavior motivated by frustration and weirdness and insecurity and anger or is your behavior motivated by love and confidence and happiness and are you like, are you quenched physically? Do you feel good physically and if you do and if you've experienced like a strong yoga class and then you run into someone, you might be more relaxed, more compassionate, more easily, and that that'll change the way that person thinks about you.

Speaker 2:          02:22:53       That'll change your interaction with them in the future. That might change your whole life and if you continue to act that way and you continue to look at the world through the eyes of this very particular discipline, it's really good for your body. It really can change. People change a lot of people. It's like there's a definite butterfly effect from that. Yeah, so if you want to just do something for you, I'm just meditate. Men Learn how to meditate. Yeah. I just got a new meditation chair actually yesterday, so I might have to start getting maybe getting into it too. Why not, man? I mean, if you were interested in doing drugs right, why not just be interested in doing something that you know you can definitely do and it's not going to fuck you up and it's only gonna help you when you were, um, when you were partying, what was your thing? Just doing cocaine by myself at the house. Really? Cocaine. It was all cocaine. Yeah. What about Bu's? The Bu's bother, you know, I just couldn't have a drink because I'd be afraid that I would buy. I would buy a coke. So if you got drunk then it would loosen your inhibitions and you'd be like, where's the coke with the fucking coke? Yeah,

Speaker 6:          02:23:51       dude and cocaine. Oh, go back to that vest or a man. So here's what happened. So I, you know, I would get, I would do some cocaine at thousand, put on these different vests. I many. Did you buy it again? I don't know. I spent too much on them, but I would probably say the priciest one I had was probably about $210. Nine. Damn. Yeah. And so I would get fucked up and put these vests on. And put on sunglasses and not know like Buffalo Bill Shit, but at least party and by myself, you know, and one time I was making a smoothie, you know, because I, you know, I have, I got like a new unknown what kind of blender it is, but it's pretty nice and I was making like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking coked up on party and you know, living high on the hog to vests on maybe.

Speaker 6:          02:24:33       Right. And I thought, I thought I heard something outside. Right. Which is kind of weird to even think of when you have a blender going. Right? So I'll leave out of my apartment to go in the hallway, lock myself out with the blender going in the morning, coked up out of my brain. Now I have to go to my landlord dude who lives right down the hall and tell him like, hey man, I got logged out. Blenders on. Oh my God, he must have hated you. Owe the blender shorts out and smoke happens. The fire alarm starts going off in the building, right as I'm at his door knocking right now. He's pissed and he's like, what's going on? And I didn't know what to say. I told him that I was throwing a late Christmas party. Dude, it was fucking into January. I will with you

Speaker 10:         02:25:24       at the time, Huh? Oh, this is two and half years ago. So he comes back to my apartment. Right? He's locks the door. There's nobody in there. Oh my God

Speaker 6:          02:25:43       man. But that's it. It was fun. Oh my God. No, that was fun. How long have you lived there for? I still live there. Yeah,

Speaker 10:         02:25:55       passionate. You know, like I've caught him doing some things. I think we're all even. How long have you been

Speaker 6:          02:26:05       sober for a two year. In two weeks. It'll be two years. What was the big thing where you like, oh, I gotta get my shit together. Your Dad was going on. Opie and Jim when Jim Norton had a radio show, it's serious and it was actually on a, it's on [inaudible] that show that he had. This is not happening. Um, and I ended up, uh, doing coke all night driving a taxi. I was in a taxi driver. This dude, Luigi got me an escort, I didn't want to escort. We're doing cocaine and like Harlem or something North Harlem and the cab driver doing coke and I just had, I was taking a cab from a party to my hotel and so we end up off on this other excursion. Next thing you know, I'm driving the taxi, he's in the back with the hooker. It's 5:30 in the morning and I got to be on the radio station at 6:30 or something.

Speaker 6:          02:26:57       So I get to the radio and I can't even talk. And uh, and darryl strawberry's the other guest, right? Who the baseball player who also had drug problem, but he's like 13 years sober. And so it was this weird moment where like, I thought I was kind of cool, but then here's a man who like, I'd always in my head maybe somewhere thought, oh, that caused like a cokehead within here he is eloquent, put together successful. And here I am, I can't even talk. And I'm with two men that I admire. Um, you know, opie and Jim Norton. Just to be honored and to be on the show, you know, and so I was like, this is, I'm, I'm not making choices. Like there's some, there's some unevenness here, you know. So what did you do after the 2012 step programs? One 12 step program. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:27:40       And then so yeah. So I've been in that. Then since then it, it's helped me out, you know? Well, I would definitely say don't do coke. Yeah. The problem with drugs is they're all under the same blanket. Right. You know when someone says drugs, you think of everything, you think of pills, you think of smoking it, you think of coke, you think a pot, you think of mushrooms. Think of everything. Yeah. But obviously they're not all the same thing. You know? It's weird to call them all drugs. Yeah. They affect you very differently. One hundred percent. I don't think if you did mushrooms you would all of a sudden be doing blow and know. Yeah. I don't think so either from Luigi cab again. Right? I don't think so either so, but I think I wouldn't want to be the guy that told you to do now I don't feel like you are, but, you know, I feel like it's something that I think about sometimes and um, but uh, you know, I don't know because I also do want to have experiences where like I'm able to get, you know, unique experiences out of my car, out of my mind and think about other stuff and like, you know, I do remember times where mushrooms would just clear my conscience.

Speaker 6:          02:28:44       They would be like, someone came up to the chalkboard where everybody written all these math problems and bullshit and somebody's drawn a dick and uh, somebody fucking cutting off somebodies head, just stupid shit and just cleaned it all off. And you're like, ugh.

Speaker 2:          02:28:55       No, I think so too. It was relaxing mushrooms, forgive you. We give you free your mistakes. I mean, this is one of the reasons why I'm like, mushrooms and Jesus are always kind of connected in folklore and a lot of people's ideas because they're both very forgiving. Like, here's the best Jesus store. If someone being forgiving, God damn coughing while it's the weed. Um, there was a guy named general butt naked. You ever heard of that guy? Real man? Yeah. He lived in Liberia and he's a famous character in Liberia because of his exploits. When he was in the middle of war, he would, uh, he would go and fight naked. Oh Wow. And he was a cannibal. He would kill innocent children on the other side in eat pieces of their heart. And he believed that it would protect them in battle and talks about it openly.

Speaker 2:          02:29:53       After doing this, he found Jesus and he came over here. He is this him? Did you have actual photos? Photos of him? I didn't know either. So then he became he, I mean, he's killed thousands of people. Oh, he's apparently in, in war. And then according to what he said, and then afterwards became a preacher and talks openly about the fact that he's killed innocent children and eating pieces of their heart. But people forgive him because he's a preacher. So his love of Jesus is so complete that people forgive him to the point where they're. Forgive the fact that he ate kids. Wow. Imagine how powerful he was. If he was your. It was your kid that this guy eight. Then you see him out preaching. Now I'd be pissed off Bro. You Ain't my kid. Yeah, it is hard the fuck. But there was a different time. Yeah, that was a different man. Yeah, it's crazy. The, the, the. For travelers guy. I forget what it's called, the vice travel guide to Liberia. It is a really, really eye opening. I'm sort of a view into what Liberia is like. Light. Liberia is a really, really poor, dangerous part of Africa. That was originally when slaves

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       left America, when they were set free, they went back to Liberia and that's where they settled. Fuck yeah. Dude, I Africa's always fucked up, huh? Yeah. That sucks man. Yeah. That's why I'm all these wild animals stories from Africa. And so this is another one that was kind of interesting. These poachers got eaten by a lion. They, uh, tried to get ahold of a rhino. They were trying to steal, kill this rhino and cut it. Turns off they try to sell them and they just get eaten. That's crazy. Did too. That's the way to go. If you could get an animal Oregon put into your body, would you do it will be the benefit. Would you get I do something. Would you get like a Hyena? But when I'm shiny, but I already have the blood of a down syndrome boy. I said I don't know what I would get mad.

Speaker 1:          02:32:12       I would probably get just something. I'd start off with something small, probably like, you know, a wrist or something or like a pinky nail. The Leopard Xal gravy that once they said splicing genes, man, Dan wants you to be able to do with people. You're going to be like, that guy ty grid. What's that guy on a condo? ACAT member. You're going to be like, thundercat. Who's what? I don't remember that guy with the red man. He was like, never tried that. I know it's definitely illegal, but do you think there's a scientists tried. I met a guy twice in people with animals. Sure. Yeah. Well, it wasn't that something that they were trying. Stalin was trying to do that with chimpanzees. Yeah. He was trying to make some sort of a chimp human hybrid. Yeah, I could see it, man. I've met some motherfuckers. Did some motherfucker.

Speaker 1:          02:32:59       Yeah. Well I think they're going to be able to do something like that soon. Dave, can you afford that? You fucking are talking to somebody and then they just get into a bird bath. Can you fucking imagine that? This is that humanity thing. Scientists claim US lab engineered to Mansi human chimp hybrid. One hundred years ago. Scientist. This is a really recent article. Huh? This isn't science alert though. Oh, this is the sun. Super Sketchy, right? Yeah. That humanity was real weird though. The thing walked up right? A lot. Yeah, and they wore a suit. What is that? That's, that's Stalin's humanz experience, but that one picture is real. That one, that one, the one next to the one year at that one. That's real. That's what it really looked like thing. Walked around with shorts on. Yeah. Luda side of his quads on that motherfucker will tear you apart.

Speaker 1:          02:33:55       Yeah. The thing I think it got very close to the woman to which became an issue. Look at data. Who is that? That's the humanity. I put tie Dean Martin's friend. Steve Martin's buddy. Yeah. Look, he's dealing coke with. What's his effort is that they got from Norco to sit in the background, but stop looking at that language. That's what I'm talking about. Look at the writing. Tell me that shit doesn't look alien. Like that's from some spaceship. Like what language is that? I don't know. I'm. I'm ready for it all man. Language was a Japanese. Yeah. That looks like it should be on. Yeah, don't, don't go back. Translate it. There we go. The language looks. It does look like. Like it's from space. Like if you saw that on. He didn't know anything about Asian languages. Do you saw that on a spaceship? He'd be like, Oh, do you think Japanese people could be from space and not know that they are the people that are really into nonsense.

Speaker 1:          02:34:55       I'm like the Zacharias situation. Do you know about all that shit? There's people that believe that there is a planet that's out far outside of Pluto that comes. It's an on an elliptical orbit and it comes near Earth every like 3000 years or something. I forget the exact number, but it's called Nibiru and on the bureau there are these people called the [inaudible] and what they are is an alien race and that this alien race engineered us and they took, they took these old monkeys like a ancient hominids and then they added their DNA to him and created a human being. This is the idea. And then the guys, Zechariah wrote all these books on this stuff and there's a lot of people that think he's full of shit, but it's interesting. It's fun. It's fun to. It's fun to speculate, you know, but the idea was that different groups of people got different level of alien.

Speaker 1:          02:35:55       Hm. Yeah. I could get will. Look, sometimes I'm talking to somebody, I'm like, I don't think this dude's like a full person. You know, like, who, who, who do we know? Don't tell mom. I don't know if it's anybody that we know. I mean, Josh Martin, that works. Sometimes it takes me for a ride, but I don't know it be an alien. Imagine if there was one just living amongst us. Oh, the whole time. We're just getting our chain yanked. Oh, I bet. I'm sure there's some chick out there that's fucked an alien. I think when I really think about it, I think that that would be the first inbreeding would be a chick would let an alien fucker. Oh, it would be a dude who fucked an alien girl. Oh No. I think now these days there's a. I could see some women fucking some aliens.

Speaker 1:          02:36:44       Boy, isn't that some of the folk lore though, some of the stories of male alien abduction or like female aliens that seduce them. Yeah. That's how they get your loads, bro. Dude. Species. I've been given a free sign. Natasha Hendrick, right? Is that her last name? Hendrix. How do you say it? And stritch. Hence trich. So they said, how many loads can your body make you? She was on fear factor. She's very nice. She's a very nice person. So really you met her? Yeah, she did. An episode of fear factor. Hottest. Wow. Forest Whitaker was in that movie. Oh, I love forrest whitaker. Damn ghost dog. I'll listen in the hustler. And he's in no last king of Scotland. He was in the color of money, not the hustler. You know what movie I like is um, that movie where they escaped from the mental health facility and Michael Keaton's in it and it's like four dudes and they go to a baseball game. You remember that movie?

Speaker 1:          02:37:48       No, I think it makes me think you probably wouldn't be able to make that movie today. Yeah. Oh yeah. Because a mental health facility or some people will be upset. Well, there's always dudes in movies would play those guys that would play someone smart who is mentally challenged. Oh yeah. Like that's a common thing dudes would always do that. Didn't Sean Penn play? Someone challenged? Yeah. Great movie with Dustin Hoffman. Did he do it? Oh, that's all right. Wayne man. Rosie O'donnell, who? Dustin Hoffman was probably the first guy to play a super autistic man. And he did great. Rosie O'donnell did it too, right? I think so, man. That's the last thing you want your enemies finding out there to imagine the outtake. Three days didn't really get my start laughing. Imagine the outtakes. If you start laughing, you monster and nowadays you have to have a real person with the disease on the side of the stage. So like the consult. Yeah. What the fuck is that real? Yeah, that's crazy, man. Come on. Really? I'm sure you think they're letting you do that without having somebody there to verify if it's legit or not. Well, how would someone verify whether or not like, like, like if someone's going to come up and go, that's not how I do it. I just thought this is not your thing. Who is this? Rosie? That's Rosie. Let me hear this

Speaker 7:          02:39:15       ahead. I like, I like Blue Card or green card.

Speaker 1:          02:39:19       Oh, that's true. I just made that up.

Speaker 7:          02:39:21       A bus driver. You, Amanda? Amanda Funeral. Have you been waiting two hours. Why didn't you wait inside or riding the bus with my sister condensate and May I have your address? Honestly. Bath, you know, you just make things harder on yourself. Buckle up for safety. Whoa,

Speaker 1:          02:39:40       pretty good. I'm wondering if you could do that movie today, you might not be able to do it like 12 years ago. I guess that's a different world, man. It definitely was a different world, man. You can't even barely breathe out there. They know it's tough. Right. But dude, I can't believe I'm going to China and they're wondering, you can do anything. Can you do anything? As far as like comedy material trouble. I mean I just think of all the different stuff they have. The animals are treated differently there. Oh, that's true. You know? Right. But I think you get in trouble if you google certain websites, like they have a different version of their. They're censored. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not gonna do anything drastic like that. Be Crazy. You get sensor a billion people. How the hell did you do that? That's pretty impressive, dude.

Speaker 1:          02:40:24       I remember going when I was a student, we went to Cuba when I was a student in college right now. I remember we went to a bookstore and all the books just started at like a certain year and that was it. Like there was no. Imagine that, and it was like in the 19 whatever, when Castro took over [inaudible]. This is going on today in China, World Cup, kiss, spark, social media, debate on sexual harassment in China. Why a male reporter in these two Russian fans gave him a kiss while he was recuperating and it's caused like a reverse sexual harassment debate and transparent. It's a big deal. Wow. He looks so. What's a big deal that in China, someone like you're not allowed to show public affection like that. Is that what the big debate is? Here's the. It came after a bunch of female journalists have been assaulted and so they started assaulting the dude the other way around.

Speaker 1:          02:41:18       I'm going to go out on a limb. He's going to be okay. He looks fine. He looks actually better than kissed on the cheek by attractive women. They're not hurting them. They can't rape him. I think he's going to be okay. Let's watch on boy, get mauled by these hot Russian broads here. Coast wow. Kiss. Nope, nothing, nothing. He's fine. He's laughing. Okay, we're done. He's laughing. We're done. Stop this. People are fucking crazy. The guys laughing, he thought it was cute. Yeah. Why would anybody make a deal out of that? It's a zero tolerance. That girl literally had a plastic Red Cup in her hand, which is the universal sign for being fucked up in public. Have you got that Plastic Red Cup in your hand? That chick's probably lit. She kissed that guy. Yeah. He thought it was cute. They didn't move them around or push them or assault him.

Speaker 1:          02:42:11       It was a friendly gesture on the cheek. This love. I think while we trying to shut down people enjoying each other, I don't think we are anymore. I think. I think things are actually, think things are getting in a lot better place in it. Just on in the media. It seems like they're not. Sometimes you know well that, that that seemed like the not the fact that someone's making a big deal out of that. That's true. You can't look. You can't compare that to a bunch of guys doing that to a girl. It's not the same. It's not devastating. The guy's going to be fine. It is different. Men and women are different. In that case, that is a very clear cut case of no one got hurt there. Did they interrupt his broadcast? Perhaps? Did they ruin what he was trying to say and I don't know what.

Speaker 1:          02:42:51       He might have had a serious message and these taught Russian broads come over and kiss him on the cheek. Maybe they fucked up his little project and what he's trying to accomplish, but there's no crime there. That's not a crime. It's not the same. If there was a bunch of dudes doing that to a pretty girl, some gorilla looking fucking football player, fucking corn fed. Iowa boys came over and kissed her and be like, Ooh, what are they doing? You remember when they were trying to make it a big deal because Katy Perry kiss some guy on American idol. Yes. Remember, this is like two months ago, she kissed him. Boy never kissed a boy. She kissed him. She brought him over and kissed him, and there was like, oh, well what if worth Katy Perry was a man that was a girl. She's stop. She's Katy Perry, and if that guy is really complained that Carrie, Katy Perry took her kiss my tears for me.

Speaker 1:          02:43:46       Dude. No one's going to love you. Shut the fuck up. If you can't appreciate Katy Perry kissing you. Oh, she's pretty. She was pretty and more people will love that man because Katy Perry kissed him. Idol contestant shuts down Katy Perry. He shut down the Katy Perry backlash. He kissed her to listen. Nothing wrong with that. Looking at, first of all, homeys k right Izzy, look at him. He could be from Idaho pushing him and he fell down. That is not a male movie. That's not. Oh, he could be. Okay. It might be that he's avoiding a that kiss until he really did find the woman that made him feel like you wanted to be kissed and maybe she stole that from them. Yeah. See, right there. Right here. Imagine if a 33 year old male artists tricked and 19 year old female or do a kids like Katy Perry. Well, imagine that's a different thing you fuck about you. Imagine that's a whole different thing. I don't pretend to men and women are the same. You fucking assholes. Imagine a Volkswagen. Fuck your stepmom. You know what I'm saying? Oh Dad, what are we doing? This stupid thing, man. It's just not the same thing. Everybody's okay. That Chinese guy was laughing, man. Oh, he probably jerked off to the video at the house multiple times.

Speaker 1:          02:45:16       Did I am going to fucking China to ask them? Somebody told me a different fruit over there. Can you could imagine that? Sure. They have different fruit in Brazil. They have different fruit in England. You get some different fruit. Fuck man. I'm excited. I'm excited. I guess I'm nervous, but I'm also excited. How many shows are you doing over there? I'm doing three shows, but you know, uh, and I've, you know, I don't know about the. Promote a guy hit me up literally over email and like, oh wow, I'm going. But next thing you know, you've got a ball. Gag mouth tied up in a basement, under a noodle shop somewhere. As long as I get to eat after Jesus Christ. Are you looking forward to the food? No, man, no. Do you? Not like Chinese food, I mean not like it, but somebody told me that you can eat animal dicks over there. You can eat fucking elbow. You were saying that you need human dirks. I think you were just joking around though, right? I don't know honestly. Think about it. Think what else. You went over there and they said, we heard you on Joe Rogan experience and we have a hockey rink and we're prepared to put on the lion fight. Are you prepared to watch? Would if they brought to you to a place and I said, Dude's gonna. Fight a line with a sword. You could leave if you like. Yeah. Would you stay?

Speaker 1:          02:46:28       I would say yeah, you'd have to. I would owe it to them. If the man's already gonna fight and I'm the only. Well imagine he comes out to fight a minute. Nobody's hitting the fucking stadium. Well, you would have to be able to trust the people that are there that they're going to let this guy get ripped apart by line in front of you and then they get rid of a body. Yeah. Would you eat during it or would you wait to eat after?

Speaker 1:          02:46:52       Gosh, it depends on how hungry I was thinking. Wait. Yeah. If they got looks over and you're fucking eating, holly's fighting for eating a hot dog. What? This guy's getting mauled and he looks up at you. Makes eye contact like you were just saying, muster on your face and shit. Like what is it? Sour Kraut and your teeth drinking a beer fall. Fuck his head. Oh Jesus. Bartender do that. When you think about that movie gladiator with Russell Crowe. What is that supposed to be? How long ago was that? Was it supposedly based? That was like a thousand years ago or more. I think it was like 980. I'm guessing more to let's go. 2,000 [inaudible]. That ain't shit dude. That ain't that long. Says it's set in Roman times. So could we get back there you think was exactly. Yeah. Thanks man. Says that's not that long ago. The people were fucking 8,100.

Speaker 1:          02:47:52       One 81 88. I was in Rome a couple of years back and I went to the coliseum. It's fucking amazing, man. It's crazy to be there just to feel it and then most of it's missing like they stripped down a lot of the stone people stole things from it and it's like it's all dilapidated and falling apart, but they go on a tour, Louis, they take you through the catacombs and they sort of explained all the different things, but they had these animals they'd gotten from Africa and they had kept them in the see that hole in the ground. That's really real. That's really how they did it, man. These animals would come out out of a fucking hole in the ground and you see that first layer of people, the first seat, the first row seats, they had to put up fucking fences. It's shit because the Tigers would leap through the hair and kill the people that were in the first row.

Speaker 1:          02:48:39       Stub hub people up those stubhub, those season pass holders. Imagine you get that Nice ticket and you fucked your buddy. You Get up to get a soda and you come back and your buddies just in pieces do that. Just the fact that people did do stuff like that. We did that. It's in us. Do you know that? That's what's crazy, man. That's what your show makes me think about. Stuff like that. Like that. There's DNA inside of us that remembers that. Well, I think when people get into situations where they need entertainment and back then right, like would you rather go to a play or see a dude have a sword fight against the tiger. Tiger? Yeah. All Day. Depends on what plays are. Boring couple plays will be good. I mean what, what? Playing Neverland. Maybe if you. I mean if there's a line and on the left you get to see a guy fight align with a sword and on the right you see a bunch of people pretend to be cast.

Speaker 1:          02:49:42       That's going to say a lot about humanity salesman or whatever the fuck you going to watch, bitch, I'm going to go see that guy get eaten. You gotta watch it. It's terrifying to watch. But the, the shock and the, the just the entertainment value before death of the fights we. Yeah, we got tickets to be the worst. The good stories have been written yet, so what the hell do you think they were doing? They had plays, they had great stories and I'm sure they had great stories but just not as good like and also the value of human life was so much lower than people were constantly going to war and the war that they fought, they fought with bows and arrows and spears and swords. So there's just bloodiness horrible bloodiness. There's probably four or five dead people on the street at the moment. So you. So maybe you're like, am I going to go see somebody else die in there and we see this play and part of the problem was the way they got rid of this shit too, right? Like the streets would be contaminated with shit should have buried it like we did around my neighborhood.

Speaker 1:          02:50:49       Imagine the blow back. If someone in some country did put together a coliseum and then people started traveling there and it became like the new hot spot. Well if I lived in Africa I would do that because it's, you know, I know that some places are so starved. They have so many animals. I think they have a lot of people believe in reincarnation. Well, we'll just do it a million dollars to have a sword fight. If you had a purse of a million dollars for someone, have a sword fight in the. Give him a shield and armor and a sword and a helmet. They're going to have a sword fight with a tiger. People would sign up for that. I mean, I feel like if you had known was better than anybody because you guys spend, you spend more time around, you know, the closest kind of thing. Maybe we have some type of gladiators. Modern Day. What do you think? Would any of those men do it? Yeah. Yeah. People would do it. What does this Jamie in 2011 man fights lion to boost Egypt. Tourism. What? Come on. Come on. This is real. Sitting in there with a little plastic lawn chair. It's got a shield. It's got a spear and shield as shady as fuck. What the fuck, dude? Hell yeah. A lot of room. Either. Not a giant line.

Speaker 1:          02:52:03       Is this? This actually happened. It says 100 percent live like recorded videos on CBS news. Jesus Christ. This guy get jacked or what isn't. That's not showing it. It must have been a long fight and it was probably subdued. Oh, be a tap. It's obviously happening. If this guy recorded, then it's probably happened. He had to do like a two minutes or something with it a bit. Yeah, the line seems fine. He's going to climb on top. He's a wrestler. Yeah. He's going to do like a fucking cage drop. Drop down on that line. You imagine that the ball's. You'd have to leap down with a spear and drive it through the lions brain from the top rope play. Spray all over the place. You could do it. Someone would do it. If that dummy got in there with that lion you. He could definitely get. If you gave someone a million dollars, he gave them a shield and a sword in armor. Given some armor. Not all armor.

Speaker 1:          02:53:13       You can pick the neck of the loin piece at lion would leap on you so fast. You're sore to be knocked out of your hand. It would just crush your fucking head with its teeth. Well, one man would do it. Yeah. One man would win maybe the mountain from game of thrones. The giant dude. Yeah. Give that guy like a battleax, like a fucking 85 pound acts. Who would do it in UFC? Who would. Who Do you think could win and it's not saying that that the greatest or the best, but who could do that would have to be the biggest guys who don't have to be like the heavyweight champ. There'd have to be steep meo chick or Francis in Ghana or someone giant who'd have to be a big powerful person because you'd have to be able to swing that fucking sword fast and you have to be able to take a hit from a 500 pound cat.

Speaker 1:          02:54:06       You're probably gonna get fucked up either way though. You need one. You may be able to take one good hit. You're going to take one good hit my just to feel like you're just going to get fucked up. Don't think you have a chance. There's a lot of debates about this. When I was reading it earlier, of course people's, a lot of people just as stupid as mean Theo. The line wouldn't have a good technique so you can fuck it up. It doesn't matter if it has good technique. The physical power of a lion, it's just so overwhelming. I don't. I just don't think people understand how much force it can generate, how quickly it can move, how quickly he could get you. It'd be. It would just fucking scramble on you and it will be on you so fast. Dude, there's a video, hilarious video of a bunch of dudes running away.

Speaker 1:          02:54:48       One in comparison. A leopard is 150 pounds or something like that and these fucking people are running left and right and this thing's coming after them and you realize like, oh my God, like, look at this, this guy running. Now watch the leper. Take the corner. Look, just look at his slides. The leopard is going so fast. It's running on the walls on the top, like the middle of the wall, above his fucking head. Watch. How has he starts running forward and the leopard comes into the picture? The leopard is literally running on a vertical wall, like watch this. Watch when it comes around the corner, look at this. It's running on the wall. It's got so much power that it's running on the side of the wall like you can't even imagine the kind of physical speed and strength that that thing has in its body.

Speaker 1:          02:55:41       It's bouncing from the side of the wall to the other side of the wall and just trying to get some traction so we could get ahold of your bitch ass way to get ahold of your bitch ass. You don't have a chance. That thing that's a fraction of the size of a lion. Just a fraction. Fuck man. Oh Jesus Christ school. Oh God. This is a video game, isn't it? Look at it. Climb over the top of that fence like it ain't shit. It's one of those video games on the dark web. I think middle school leopard, dude. You find that thing. You just get to shoot it. You just got to shoot it. There's not much you could do. Oh, it's fucking this dude up. Oh Jesus. Oh, oh my God. Board it. Just bit them. And then ran off. He got lucky.

Speaker 1:          02:56:33       He got lucky that there was all those other people and the commotion and 4 million people have watched that. So would it. So as, as people were ready to see that 4 million people who have safely. Why Shad and they're not crying at a center right now or anything like that. You have. But watching that doesn't seem real. You know, we watched that. If you were there in real life, like if you're in the hockey rink, sit in those excellent Goldstar seats were in Mexico. I think you're in China somewhere. Yeah, but they have been doing that in China.

Speaker 8:          02:57:03       Is this how I got the guy or not? This one here. Hold on. Oh Wow. Coming around here. Try to climb the fence and.

Speaker 1:          02:57:15       Gotcha. Wow. Look at. Dragged him down. Oh my God. What do you do? It just wants to get out. It doesn't know what it wants. It doesn't know what the fuck it wants to jump in. The water didn't think they swim. Swim. Oh, well that's not good. I think he's bleeding or not. Oh yeah. He's getting his legs, his arms, his legs, everything's getting torn up. All that shit's on the ground. That's blood. It's his blood. I don't want that on there. We definitely don't want that. I just think we really need to understand when you talk, you're talking about a large predatory animals really need to understand what bitches we are. The toughest men that's ever lived is a weak ass bitch compared to a leopard. Just the fact that, oh Jesus, fuck man, who's doing all this? Oh, I've seen this one. This is in India, right? What happens in these areas, man, these cats, they get into these villages and just start fucking people up. It's so crazy. Imagine that as a small animal compared to align in comparison. Anything else you before we wrap this bitch up and bring it home? I think I've seen enough today. Well, you realize that, uh, if you're ever in a confrontation, one of those animals,

Speaker 1:          02:58:34       that's going to be difficult. Do you realize that you have that in your mind now? Yeah, I think it's not a game as much as I thought it was more of a game. Well, I think this, I think it would be neat to go out and hunt some type of an animal with a knife to start to get my Garda hunt an animal with a knife. Do you think you could even have a raccoon with a knife? Yeah. Do you think you could 150 percent, do you think they recommend might fuck you up though? Fuck no man. How quick do you think a raccoon moves? Like if you don't get that first stab into that, that you do that double up. How long do you think it takes for that thing? Is latched a hold of your face cloth on your eyeballs, out of your fucking head and you're feeling your eyeballs getting socked out of your skull because it tears through your tissue paper.

Speaker 1:          02:59:23       Thin eyelids, like they're nothing and it just biting man. Chewing your eyes out. No, I think if it got on, you will do. The tough part is if it gets on you, you can't stab it because you'll stab yourself. This is Kevin rose is Kevin rose, got a raccoon, chucked it down the stairs. Did he? Yeah, he fucked that. Recognize the record was fucking his dog up. That's a guy who loves his dog. He said he didn't even realize he was doing it. He was just doing it before he even knew it was happening. But look how he did it. He hooked it like a, like a pillow, woof pitch. Bam. Damn. We went after it. Gangster. I'd go out there with a gangster. Yeah. Well, it's probably, like you said, it's just a natural instinct. That's the basic instinct of a man, you know.

Speaker 1:          03:00:08       Well, what I was saying was with those guys we're talking about when they encountered that grizzly bear that you just, you reached this survival mode and you have your regular operating system and then there's survival default mode when some real shit goes down like a fucking grizzly bears right next to you. Well, I would hate that. It will. I think that, you know, going back to like what we were saying earlier, like that's the moment you'd find out who you are and I would hate to find out at that moment that I'm not a fighter, you know, well that, that all could be built up, right? You can build that up through martial arts that you like. There's people that are just naturally inclined to never quit and then there's people that have to learn it, but you can learn it. Yeah. Yeah. I want to start learning some of it to have just a little bit more that I'm just to fill in whatever that space inside of me and sometimes that feels a bit inferior. I don't

Speaker 2:          03:01:00       need to feel invincible, invincible. No, but I do. I wouldn't mind getting a little call in some of those areas where it's like, okay, if somebody grabs me like I, I know that I'll be able to grab them back. Yeah, man, take Jujitsu. It's easy. You already know Eddie. Yeah. Yeah. Why not, man to fun? Take some beginner classes. Start slow. It's fun to man. You really enjoy it. As long as you're a healthy guy, like mentally, like as far as your ego, so long as you don't try to not tap. Yeah. No, I don't need to. When I. I've just been. I think I'd be happy to have the comradery and that would be. I think the tapping is probably some humility. That's probably good for you. It is definitely. It's just hard to do. Especially when you're in the beginning you'll try to resist and try to resist an arm bar that maybe you should tap and you can get hurt.

Speaker 2:          03:01:48       That's how you can get hurt. You get hurt from not tapping. Especially other beginners. They don't know how hard like a black belt, you're more safe rolling with the black belt and with anybody because they're. They're going to be able to tap you if they want to and when they do, they're not going to hurt you. Right. Whereas you might get in there with some Herculean white belt who's just learning the techniques. He grabs a hold of your arms, like fucking yanks on it. You're like, ah, you don't even have a chance to tap in to and you're hurt. Right? Yeah. That's a good point. I think. Yeah. Maybe I'll see if Eddie can help me out to get me. He can. Yeah. He can do. Last night was weird at the comedy store, wasn't it? Did it was so weird. They fourth of July as a strange night to perform. People like, why are we here? And they're like, why are you here?

Speaker 2:          03:02:34       It was a weird crap. It was a great crowd. It looked good, but they, they. They also felt odd that they were at a show. Yeah. I didn't realize it until you said that. You're like, you're like, yeah, these people are thinking it's fourth of July with the fuck. It's not wrong. It's not right, but it's just like, does my calendar even work? The weirdest crowd you'll ever experience as Christmas? Yeah. You ever do Christmas shows at the store? I did one Christmas show, the store like 10 years ago. I'm like, well, I'm taking the night off for the rest of my life. Fucking crowd's weird, man. They were weird. It was more than 10 years ago because it had to be like 2006. You had fun though. You haven't been feeling weird. Oh, last night. Yeah, last night was fun. Last time. It was fun. Yeah, I had a good time, but it's just a, it's a different feeling.

Speaker 2:          03:03:20       But I think people are feeling differently about comedy now. Uh, because so many people are really politically correct outside of comedy and almost forced into it like you're hearing so many things about people getting fired from their jobs because of sexual harassment or from a sexually harassing joke. Like someone would say jokes in the office that were inappropriate. So they got fired. I mean this is happening left and right here about the guy from Netflix that got fired for doing. Yeah. He's having a conversation about offensive words that you shouldn't be using in comedy. And because of this, this conversation during this conversation about

Speaker 1:          03:03:57       this subject, he used the word Nigger, right? Because he was in this conversation and did it one other time apparently because of that. Not Calling anybody that saying it out loud was fired from Netflix. That is crazy, unless less, if he was saying it like he likes having a good time with, right. Like he was like, you know, right now, like how was he saying? Was He, that's the thing. Right. But the thing is, it's very strange that that word is only for bitten by the people that can't. It can't be used on, you can't use the n word on you work, but if you could use it on someone and they happen to be a person of color than that person, you're not allowed to do that. Right. It's very interesting man. Well I remember when I would go, when I would ride my bike to school, a lot of my black friends would get on my bike, you know, and they get on and I would ride.

Speaker 1:          03:04:56       I mean it was fun, you know, and they used to call me the Nigga bus whenever I rolled up and they would all call me that and I honestly felt and they were my friends. It was fun. So. But you couldn't say it, you know, and I could, I couldn't say it. And also, look, I find, you know, when somebody says anything, if it's something to do with, uh, race, uh, gender, anything and they have malice or ill intent and these days I think if you do that, somebody's going to correct you really fucking quick. And so I agree and in a bit, but in a business setting, man, and that type of setting, it's just, yeah, you, you make people so aware that they can't. I don't know, that's the fuck it is. It is crazy. But it's also, he was talking about forbidden words and comments.

Speaker 1:          03:05:40       It's his business, but you're saying you can't make a sound with his mouth. This is what you're saying. You're not, he's not calling someone that name. He's using that word and people file complaints about him using that word. So the people that he worked with ratted him out. He wasn't allowed to say the word right, like, but the car then, then it gets real crazy. Whereas if you're a black guy, you could say it all day and it's funny, you could say it in front of white people and they can laugh, right? But they can't say it, but they can't say they can't say it. But if you're Chris Rock, you can go up with the overall tonight and just have like 15 different use of that word in a half hour set and. No. And everyone's like, that was great. That was a great show. Right? But then, yeah, but then it'll be the same people that say we should never say or hear this word.

Speaker 1:          03:06:29       It's interesting. Some people learn it from different places, some people learn it from black people, some people learn it from white people. It has a different feel, a different meaning to it. Well, and I was even talking with Mr Peterson the other day, um, who I was saying, you know, the toughest thing I find that, especially coming from the area where I came from were, you know, there was a lot of racism was probably kind of went to, it was popular when I was young, but it was a part of the, it was part of the, of the cloth and the in the, in the area, you

Speaker 6:          03:06:56       know, was poor, black and poor white. And you know, poor people. Like to fucking fight as you know, it's crazy. It's like, yeah, it's like, hey, let's be on the same team for a minute, you know, and we can change the love that you have about white privilege. Oh, thanks man. Hilarious bit. But did you, did you,

Speaker 5:          03:07:13       I find it fun talking to someone like Peterson does. Was it challenging?

Speaker 6:          03:07:17       It was challenging. I felt nervous. I felt nervous because, you know, I'm not as smart as him, you know, most people aren't. Right. But I also felt, you know, I know that um, you know, he really admired you. He mentioned at the beginning. So that made me feel a little bit more comfortable because we had something in common. And then, um, and then, uh, he's a nice guy and I thought he is a. I tried as much as I could to. I wasn't trying to pick them apart or anything. I just wanted to see what he cared about and he just genuinely, I swear to God, he genuinely, maybe more than anyone I'd ever met. He genuinely, I think, cares about trying to help young men feel better for it and that, you know, we didn't get into anything political or anything like that. It was mostly about, you know, like a take a small step, take a small step and you can change your life. Um, you know, if you have a, if you have accurate goals, evil, he's a real clinical psychologist and he

Speaker 5:          03:08:12       understands the traps that the mind leaves for itself. Yeah. And we all fall into those traps. Yeah. We all do.

Speaker 6:          03:08:19       Yeah. And I've fallen into a lot of them and, and, and, you know, so it was nice. I mean, I, you know, as I think of him as like a, I thought a with Vera, like, you know, like Chegg Rivera, but like Canadian collect, but I know he's not like, I wanted to tell him that so bad and I forgot, but you know, it was supposed to be a murderous monster. Right. And he's not like that. He's not a socialist like that. But um, but he, you know, he's like the, he's kind of like the dad that a lot of us didn't here and we need to hear again and it's like we need those reminders of some of those things. And, and I think he genuinely, to me, he genuinely wants humanity to be, well, that's what I felt from him does. But the thing is, when you want

Speaker 5:          03:09:02       men to feel better, women will think you want them to feel bad. And this is the problem that we have with this whole right versus left male versus female. Black versus white. Anytime there's two groups and there's supposedly pitted against each other, anything positive for one side becomes negative for the other side. But I think it's the opposite. I think that if men feel better, they'll be nicer to women. And I think that if they get their shit together, it's better for everybody. And I think that if someone's looking for men's, like looking at men's values or men's lives, they're not disregarding women, but what we look at it that way, like, no, you should be paying attention to women. You're obviously a misogynist. You're focusing on men's rights, like it's an insult to call someone an Mra, which is a men's rights activist. It's kind of Hilarious, you know, like what is

Speaker 2:          03:09:54       like, if someone was a women's rights activist, would you ever say that it would be an insult to call someone a women's right activist or advocate? That's crazy, but it's openly dismissed from the feminine side, making fun of the masculine side. Like men's rights activists are openly dismissed. It's really, it's very strange.

Speaker 6:          03:10:13       Yeah. I like to think I'm, you know, I, I, I, to me, it's a lot of women's rights activists and look, the strongest, hardest working man I've ever known was my mother, you know, and I'll say that to the end of the earth. I mean, my mother delivered newspapers since I was born, still does, you know, and um, and she sacrificed a lot of raising her children. She wasn't there for us emotionally because she had to work all the time. You know, she didn't even have, she didn't have the opportunity to be. But you want to talk about a feminist? Like I'd never known one more in my life. I don't think, you know, uh, she had to play a man and a woman, you know, in a lot, in a lot of instances. Um, and I, I, that's great that you appreciate her. Oh, it to the end.

Speaker 6:          03:10:55       But that means so much to you. Yeah. And we started even like, I started doing this thing where like we try and treat a single mom out to like a weekend when I'm at a, on a, on a weekend of shows, you know, pay for the sitter, pay for the dinner, you know, and uh, and not to object a single day as you know, but, you know, for me, like I, uh, you know, like I was even talking with Ms Dot Peterson about this. Like I never got to make like the reason I think I got into comedy, I never got to make my mom laugh, you know, like she was always, she was always tired and he was always working hard and tired and we just didn't have that connection, you know? And so I think that's one of the reasons I got into comedy. The only person I've ever really probably wanted to make laugh as my mother, you know, and then here I am like just doing all this other chicane re on the outside.

Speaker 6:          03:11:36       Does your mom think that you were fondling when you were, when you first started? I don't know. No, I don't think he, I don't think she thought if anything like that. My mom literally said to me, I just don't think you're very funny. Oh Mom, dude. I saw that yoga video, the young video. You're doing comedy with the longest hair on the sides and stuff. That was a little cutie dude. That was the best. And that was a really cool video. I was probably like 24, 23, maybe 23, one, two, three, somewhere in that range. Man. Crazy. Um, but I think, uh, I'd like to, you know, a lot of, some of these, you know, aggressive sometimes angry feminists. They're not mothers either. And that's odd to me. Like I'm,

Speaker 2:          03:12:21       you know, people get, they get into something because they feel there's an imbalance and if it isn't true feminism or they get into being a men's rights activist, I feel bad for those guys because I think a lot of those guys are just been fucked over by bad relationships or shitty divorces are shitty laws in terms of like a child custody and then they, you know, this is their, their response and it's what we would really like is for everyone to be treated as an individual and, and no groups, no male versus female, no fucking right versus left. Just all human beings, individuals. And I think that's like the ultimate goal for society, for healthy society. It's not to not eliminate judging people, but judge people based on their actions and their words and their deeds, not their sex or their, you know. But then you're always going to have people that want to fuck the opposite sex.

Speaker 2:          03:13:14       And you're always gonna have people that want to fuck the same sex to make them uncomfortable. Like I've been hit on by dudes before and been made to feel very uncomfortable. I'm sure you have to. The only difference is a, I know how to fight and when the dude was hitting on me I was like, listen, cut the shit like this. This wasn't a scene where I was worried I was going to get raped. It was. I was worried I was going to go to jail for fucking somebody up. Like I don't want to have to hurt you man, but don't touch my dick again. Like I've been in situations before, but it was never a situation where it was like a woman where I was worried I was going to get held down. Someone's going to do something, but you can understand them when those situations.

Speaker 2:          03:13:50       Like I can easily see how women feel that way. Like way worse. Way Worse. Yeah. I get that too. It's like I'll get like dick pics and stuff from men into my instagrams and stuff bro. And it's fucking like, some are aggressive with that shit, but that's zero defects. Zero. Well you're going to get them right now. They come. People feel bad for Theo that were withheld. Puppies out. Oops. Something bold about a girl. She'll send you a picture of her tits. Those guys sends a picture of his Dick is presumptuous. Fuck like, asshole. Fuck you. Fuck you with my. Get a girls sending you something you're excited to see. Like if a girl sends you pictures of her tests and she's holding them, she was like, I heard you wanted the. You're like, whoa. Oh, that was real. This was crazy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:14:44       Gatorade. Somebody gets those. Look Open. Sexually harassed by this woman. Shot the fuck up. You're fine. Pussy. Walk it off. Dude. I uh, yeah. It's uh, it's so true that. Um, but I do know, I start to notice how people feel. I start to notice how. Yeah. When that happens. Like, oh, I see how you feel. I see now it's all women feel. If they get that you get, there's a door that you could look through where you could see a mile away maybe where this could go. Right? But to be the person that feels that like a dude wants to stick his dick in you and shoot loads into your body, that's crazy. It's like a video game patient. No memory go, Mr. that's, you know, that's the difference between men and women and this is also why there's more anger because women have experienced so many guys trying to do that to them that they developed this bad taste for men and I understand that and we need to be better men, you know, and I believe that honestly, that's one of the reasons why, you know, I listen to your show. It's one of the reasons why, you know, I'm, I'm excited. You know,

Speaker 1:          03:15:49       I was intrigued to listen to Mr Peterson and reading his book and um, you know, I do want to be a better man and it's hard to even be a better human being. Everybody does it or a woman or what, whoever you are, we all want to do better. And if you don't want to do better, you're probably going to have a fucked up life because then you're not trying. You're not perfect. It's no way you're perfect. No one who's ever lived has been perfect. I ever want to pay. Yeah. And every day you have to pay attention. Every day you got to pay attention to everyday, to your behavior. To the way you think and you have to constantly be assessing it and moving it in the right direction and when you are moving in a positive, generous, loving direction, it feels better. You feel better.

Speaker 1:          03:16:26       You feel like a better person. Yeah. You really. Yeah. You really do. You know, I'm glad that I'm. Yeah, I'm just glad to be alive and be able to like try and like learn about shit. It is exciting. It is exciting. And you know, I think one of the things that fucks people up more than anything, and this is what I've experienced this with so many friends, I'm like, dude, you're thinking about your past. Like it's you and it's not you. You can't beat yourself up for something you did 20 years ago or the way you were doing coke and fucking your life up five years ago. That's not you anymore. Yeah. You did do those things. Yeah, but that doesn't mean you are who you are, that you're, you're not that person anymore. Like as long as you decide, but if you get caught in that trap, you'll be that person again.

Speaker 1:          03:17:09       I mean there's, we all know that one dude that can't stop, he can't stop. He takes a few months off. I'm sobering up now. Everything's doing good and then whew. Off to the races again. Shows up. Coked up drunk comes to the comedy store, won't shut the fuck up. Shit. Breadth and everybody's face. Jesus sweat dripping off his ear lobes. We all know that dude, seven fingers in his ass. We all know that dude. There's so many of those dudes. They just can't. They, they never break free. They break free for a little while and never go, wow, I don't want to be that person anymore. They just go, well, I'm not that person this week. And then, you know, they just get addicted to being sober for a little while. And then next thing you know, just dark arts dark. Why do you call it dark hard?

Speaker 1:          03:17:54       Just because if anything that I think takes you out of like your path towards some sort of enlightenment a little bit, that's what I think, you know, dark arts, they got in Harry Potter like voldemort and everybody, dirty spells turning candy into worms and everything right now. Anything that takes you off of the path of enlightenment, the dark arts, that's most things don't right. Most Times you jerking off, oh, come on myself so many times bro. Right, and when you do, do you ever feel good about it? Do you ever feel like. Yeah, that's what I should times seasonal. Like occasionally during the holidays, Bro. I'm not even joking. Sometimes they're the holidays. I'm just so filled with joy that the shame doesn't get me. Do you know that it actually does alleviate anxiety and people recommend doing it before you have a performance. You have to perform in front of people. Yeah. It's not a bad idea. WAC One off and your hotel room before you go to a show,

Speaker 2:          03:18:48       you'd be like less anxious. I could see that navy maybe for like a special or something. You know, Vio von. That was the three hours. What is it really? Wow. More than three hours. How long was it? Three slash 20 jeeper. 20 time. This conversation I've ever been on this fucking room. Dude. Something happens in this place. I don't even know how it works.
