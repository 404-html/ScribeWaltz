Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I mean with Rohn, ladies and gentlemen, this is a cluster fuck of a podcast, but it's going to be awesome. Or this is a lot of fucking people here. But this is a fight companion podcast brought to you by on and go to o n and it used Kohler rather save 10% off any and all supplements. Oh Shit. Human optimization time. Listen, we got to fucking Stackhouse house to my left, the master, my brother from another mother, Mr Eddie Bravo's here. Ian Mccall, his friend, Kemal Corinne, Corinne Gamal, Abdul Jabbar. I knew it was one of those, uh, just met him. Uh, Ian Mccall, of course, one of the baddest motherfuckers on the planet earth next to him. Big Brown is in the house. Bitches. What, what? No, no, no. Just in the fucking world. Preparing for his next big fight with Travis Browne. Gotta be very confused and calling that groundless. Pick Brown.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       I mean, Travis Browne is her and next to him, of course, my other brother, Mr Abi Marcus Warrior, poet us on Twitter. Follow him. He puts out great links and his Gal Whitney right below, she's here at fresh off of a Jujitsu lesson, just, just competing in a turn of herself pretty and fucks pitches up. And uh, we're about to start the very first fight. If you've ever heard one of these podcasts before, um, don't expect any like deep insight to the nature of the universe. Most of it is people getting drunk watching fights. So we did, we got off the plane all up in his bitch. We got boxes, son. We got, we got God damn. Look at that booty. You just get a half a brain. You would get a fucking mad rush of human neurotransmitter's. All right, first rounds about to start. They just touched gloves, man. The good shit time says four 55 right now. So if you're sinking up, the thing about the internet, if you're watching it on the internet, it's, um, we're about maybe 10 or 15 seconds slower because there's a lag between uploading to Ustream and a, we're watching it right now. So it's very first round of the very first fight. It's Diego for what is the fight Diego for rarer.

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Hold on a second. I'll tell you any minute now ladies and gentlemen do, do, do, do, what's that? How much? What did you, these mother fuckers are gambling Diego and Ben Neale dairy. You wish, uh, I do not know much about these gentlemen. Ben. He's a bad ass. I've rolled, I've had the privilege of rolling with him a few times. Uh, Ben [inaudible]. If you go on Benny Benny and who was the gentleman in the black shorts here is undefeated. Yeah, I've seen Diego for air fight before monster. He's got very good Jujitsu to very good Jujitsu. Good striking too. Like throws, throws hard shots but nasty Jujitsu. A couple of years ago, he, Benny went up against a chron

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       and lost by decision by advantage. I think you saw the fight. If you saw it, you would have seen that would be advantage given wasn't, wasn't a legit advantage. Uh, there was a sweep that was that he wasn't given that Benny wasn't given the points to a really, really good fighting. Real quick. My boy and Neil Magnum won his fifth straight TK the gazelle. That's five this year, five in a row. That's pretty amazing. He's just not as flashy. So a lot of people don't talk about them. Like you said you, you didn't even know any of that is, I mean, I, I don't want, I barely keep up with anything now I know why. The why is the smell on it? I'm going to hear him. Check, check, check, check. It wasn't, oh, I'm sorry. Were you saying that he didn't know what I think, uh, I think that there's a chance that now it's really loud reason why there's two maturation of the UFC. I think that was done on purpose, so we wouldn't watch anything else. I can barely keep up with the UFC. Why the fuck? How the fuck am I going to watch Bella?

Speaker 1:          00:03:54       No, you know what it is. I'll tell you exactly what it is. There's only a certain amount of fighters. There's hundreds and hundreds of fighters and if you just let those dudes just run free, they get scooped up by other organizations. And the reality is there's a lot of fucking top talent out there. There's a lot. If you want to have an organization that has 300 fighters on contract, you've got to have an ass load of events press plus the ideas just keep spreading this shit everywhere. But on fights everywhere for the card international two at a time

Speaker 2:          00:04:23       we'll talk about on the Internet all the time. It's, it's a known subject. Uh, what's up with the, the saturation with the over saturation in America, in America internationally, it's growing. So it's like this is it good? Was there a plan to oversaturate

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       because not that they don't believe it's oversaturating the spot. No, they don't. They don't believe it's oversaturating. They're putting on good fights. So just trying to put on as many fights as they changed it and it's tougher for them to get famous fighters to the show man show. Look at Conor Mcgregor, the motherfucker got famous to me. Now you're talking about the exception, right? Neil Magni, we go five years ago, he's five and no, he, you know, he's on the front cover and fighters only doing shift managers. Good decision every time he know he just walked by t killed tonight. He won his last fight by Tko talking about five [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       He's got mad skills cause he was a train part of mine. Other than that, I wouldn't be doctors. And I'm saying it's like him who's been winning. How come he doesn't get as much as much like John Fitch? Don Fitch was on popular fighter. I mean it depends on what he was. He was successful. You still probably a little tough for a title, strong walkout song, but you don't have very strong rusty chains. Come on son. But he wasn't exciting so, so people want to see him lose. I like to stock. Well I let you, that's what I like about it. The staff style test people, you know, he's unbelievably tough. He fucking on guys.

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       He grinds. Dana White said though. Ooh, let us move a bunker. Lewis is, he lost his eyes. Got Your cut. Craziest thing that Berkman bout him is how nasty. This is a good, a good top gay man. Real good balance. Oh Shit. He trains a standup with Hafael. He's, he's awesome. How about Damien Maia. Dan, John [inaudible], John Fitch. He John Fished Donkey. John Fitzjohn fit true. Holding onto monkey fucking a football. Oh Shit. He'll hook. You won't get caught in that forever as good say never son. Yeah, his knee is so flexible. All I would go for knee bars like walked all day on him. He's twist out there, be twisted so far back and his coach a text. Right? Crazy. What is up with dudes who have like super flexible joints? I don't know, 20 years. Whaler I think told that you remember when oiler Fuck Sakharova arm bent the fuck behind his back.

Speaker 3:          00:06:58       You're for sure it is. Or 100 years and years of Jujitsu. Is it like starting as a baby? I think Jujitsu helps. Like Eddie Bravo. I mean your show like you're, you're so flexible down there. Don't you think you were born that way? Were you born flexible? Whom? I disagree. Everybody's born man. You look stiff, walked by and you are not born. You look super stiff rocking then I'm with it. I think all babies are born in flexible, but some just keep using it and some don't use it and they lose it. It's about, it's how you grow up. If you don't use it, you lose it. We gotta be real careful about not talking over each other. Sorry, and for me, I used to like my, my toenails with my feet. That was my bad habit I did that. Kept the flexibility while all the kids, I did the exact same thing when I was a kid.

Speaker 3:          00:07:49       Being a disgusting Tufts private though I don't do it anymore. My mom, because my boys didn't have locks. You have to make sure your mom's not going to walk. We're both hands on your feet or like, did you Bria? I bite my toenails. Flexibility, flexibility, something you can achieve. Flexibility that a lot of people, a lot of people don't work hard enough at it turned into this son. I agree with that jumps out at the same time. That's a little bit, some guys are freakishly, he's been doing it forever though. I'm not that flex. Not like explosive. It's not like that and that's a different animal and brand. Anybody can get flexible if you stretched rubber guard, he knows that when you walk into a kickboxing school you can't kick to the head to Das and eventually you'll be able to kick it ass to that fucking shot was sweet. You roll with that guy, he just doesn't quit. It's freezing. It's supposed to stop good isn't it? You know, but I think man, I think there's people that just don't put in the effort and they just accept the fact that they're not flexible. Remember that dude that we had, the big player guy who

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       got stupid flexible over the course of the year. He had terrible flood. He would some stuff stretching and he got mad flexible in a year. He was like a soldier. Some people get get to load. The goal is to get to the huge, he was built like you said, giant dude. He's like two 50 we used to call it riding the ball when we were in fucking roll with that guy and you were going to take him under your wing and, and, and you hooked him up with a kick boxing trainer and he came up to him, said, hey, I can't kick to the head man. I don't know what to do. What would you tell them? Retire.

Speaker 3:          00:09:29       He's the pessimism of dude. Oh. Oh

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       Damn. I would say beat it. Nerd Benny just cracked him with that neat dude. He was dominating them on the ground too. I was really surprised by how he took them down and then got his back and was hanging onto him. Where's this kid from? With the son? He started with the Bruno. Matt mood at a health Gracie. Nice half grace. He makes a lot of killers. Yeah. He's got a lot of killers up there in northern California. You had Cameron real up there. He had a lot of dudes up there. Right. David Tarell, he's out of there. Dave camera. Rio De Camera, animals, animals, animals up there. Dude. Gumby Scott Mouth. Well, how was mad at Bj when Bj left and went to Nova Uniao right. Remember that column? A trader details of that. Hopefully. Yeah. Hopefully they worked it out, but I'm talking about the one in his body kick off Tustin. Oh, where's, Oh, who's teachers there? That? Bruno Mahmud. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. But he also trains at the Hafael now I had a king. Oh, okay. Hockfield Cordero yeah, he's a good guy, man. He's so, yeah, I tattooed him and his wife a bunch of times. Awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He better be otherwise it just says something vulgar.

Speaker 3:          00:10:46       Then his wife have been a weird [inaudible]. You got to keep that shit quiet. [inaudible] information. You gotta fucking be a little shy about that. Hey you do you guys party being great. You're death to host absolutely nothing. She had no idea what that meant. And we were at, we were by ourselves at a club and Taco and some couple comes up, all cook out of their board and you guys party, you want to have fun. And I'm like, no, no, no, we don't. We don't party. That's a diff rather. Yes, 50 with it just just perfect, just perfect. Cemented like five year old tits with a tiny little dress on the trade off. Never works. It never works. And then, and then of course later we look at him at another table and there have swapped and another couple with women on cocaine makes things happen. Just does she want to switch strong because they're all, they don't a fuck dude. When I

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       was in Tampa I was doing stand up in Tampa and they were all ugly. There was like 40 of them, this couple, 20 on each side, 20 guys, 20 girls and they were all swingers and they wanted to take us to a swinger place is me and Maddie Kirsch and we were like, what? Look at you fucking monsters. This is, it's like that scene in the fucking, you're still ugly. Fear and loathing in Las Vegas. When Hunter Thompson's on assets checking into the hotel and the lizards are fucking blood on the floor. Tell me about the golf shoe ever. One of the best things that I think when your dad, you know, you're fucked up and you're old and you're a swinger, like you're just a mess, you'll just fuck anybody. Anybody's fucking these put lipstick on. Good. We're good. We're good pile drive my wife for 30 years so it doesn't want to fuck. You know, there's like 10 years where you, you might be thinking about it, but you won't pull the trigger and then after like 20 years like dude, they shit on it. That'd be like a fuck someone else.

Speaker 1:          00:12:59       All I gotta do is let her bang or the dude's sick of bang in their life. There's the regional motion, the books you get to keep your wife and have sex with others. You heard about the key party, all you got to do these to do those in the 70s everybody's, everybody puts their 20 years in a pile. You guys, you guys don't have headphones on, right? So you don't realize what a cluster fuck this is. This two separate conversations going on at the exact term is about a key party. Second Party, he saw swingers, swingers party. They would all throw keys into a a a bucket and whoever got, you know, you just pick whichever person going home with.

Speaker 1:          00:13:49       Yeah. Well tell people the keys. Just some gay warlock like yeah. Tough, tough actions. Life. Hopefully it hurts her pussy. She doesn't want anymore. She goes back to your regular deck. I'd act sick as sick when you look at that. Wow. Who's that? Oh Damn. They got someone with boots. Had Brazilian girl. I have to have an ass to be a presumed Jenny Andraj Allie, she's built correctly. Number true. Yes. Mouse and that left die man like seven years ago. She had a beautiful body look at is look at his left eye man. What Ha what had he caught a bunch of shit in that round, right? Did he get tagged a good, a couple of Nice, good defense to man. Oh came over the top there. But that was a lot of energy and not a lot of results. Good. Good defense. And he landed a vicious fucking leg kick right before that. Flory those kicks are way too slow. Powerful. Ian, Ian Mccall hummingbird like speed cause might be a little fatigue. Yeah, well for I just went of for a big, big charge. And

Speaker 1:          00:15:06       how'd he say his last name? Darvish. Deruge. Yeah he blocked. Most of that is nice. Is Nice Cardio with guys. Fucking incredible. Ooh, nice knee to the body by error for how do they keep going? The pulsing, breathing coaches, those are so important. Those moments right in the scramble and it take down to the guy lands, the hard shots. Yeah. Like especially those hard knees to the body if you could time it just right, right, right. Yeah. You know there's going to be that opening, you know this is going to be that brief window to get something in scrambles, everything scrambled and it tells like who is in like really tip top shape and fucking is really driven and wants it and who is looking to take a little bit of a break, who's looking to like maybe not push as hard to capitalize on those moments because those moments are going to gas you and if you're tired already, it's a mad scramble. And is that pause? Do I take a breath here or boom, do I fire the shot and then a high level in those scrambles, you're going to have this small window attacked or die. Yeah, you're never too good. And Anderson Silva, Stephan Bonner, there isn't that scramble. He landed that fucking vicious need of the body and that was it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       Most submissions you see at a high level or during the scramble in the Ama guys have that good point. He fucking knee. The body knows. Got a really good one. Okay. Oh boy. Yes. Cowboy. He's got a beautiful one off that left leg. He keeps guys from coming in. You know as you're charging in, he's pawn actually with the jab and you come to close that distance that catches you with that body. Knee, boom. Over. He's got a vicious one. Two troughs. Brown's ain't bad either. It's not bad, dude. Overeem is just, it seems like he's just having the hardest time taking punches these days. It's just not the same guy forever. They hit in his face too. It hurts. It just puts him out. It's crazy. Well, the only against Ben Rothwell. I never defend Ralph over him ever because he's done so much steroids. However, when he five Ben Rothwell, he got hit behind the ear. So people that, oh, his chains out of control. When a two or six five pen man hitch behind the air, it's going to fuck you up man. He just is so I don't think it's a matter of a chin in that fight. Look up Cain Velasquez takes bombs. Junior carnival right behind me. He went down. He wobbles you. They're not now, but they're wobbling and get Tko.

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       Yeah, I, you know, I just feel like you go back to Overeem versus Brock Lesnar and you are looking at may be the scariest fucking heavyweight of all time. Right? What I 100% of the pounds of just 263 he weighs in at two 63 and he looks like our God damn cartoon he does. And he was like, yeah, it just doesn't even look like a real, you can't respect that though, man. You and now now give all of us the same supplements he was on. Let's see what's up. That's what I'm proposing. I'm proposing everybody of this nature get bullshit, bro. Why don't we all go back to not training? Well, what the fuck are we talking about? Don't try to get better. We all go. Yeah, I'm done. I'm talking about everybody being on steroids. I fuck it. Let's just do this.

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       Don't make this a fucking, uh, main page article and when you're goofy, fucking 100 websites and pretend I'm being broken ones don't believe that everybody should be on steroids were already you were drinking. You said it. I would like to say that on a broadcast. So fucking everybody get on steroids. Obviously. I work in pride. Vandelay Silva is banned for life. That's fucked up. That's fucked. What he's done for the sport. Crazy. Unbelievable, ridiculous. You can't run from a drug test, but I can't support that spending first benefit here, spending for a year without even testing them. I'm a hundred percent down with that. That sends a very clear message to guy. Can't earn money fighting for a year. He's got to go and do seminars. All that said, oh, for where we're going to tag that same eye to his hand was on the mat touching out. I was already swollen up, but I just think that a year, a year, a year, and maybe a hundred thousand dollars fine.

Speaker 1:          00:19:03       If you want to make it Steve. Wow. That's steep. Yeah. Well he got 60 grand and Brandon, you boy fucking Beny Beny, Beny derash through. He's a bad motherfucker. And this is his first UFC fight, huh? How many other guys got like four or five? No, no. Last year I was at an event corner and he loved it and he was on a smaller show is the headline and a small show. Yeah. He's done for these. This is a, this is a fourth one in the UFC. He, um, he's, he lost wants to ram key. Oh Wow. He got killed by Ramsey. I mean, I'm so impressed with this guy, man. I'm, I'm surprised that Ramsey got him. What's his overall record? How many has he won? Good question. He is, uh, six, eight one and o eight one and, oh, so Ramsey's, you only got to beat him.

Speaker 1:          00:19:58       Wow. I'm, I'm fucking super low brother. Did my reflexes are still busted with celebrations and everyone's getting busted. Do you think, uh, very few guys are doing steroids now. Uh, I think it makes it tougher but it listen professional sports, it's part of the game. With your, in the Olympics, NFL, NBA, it's a part of the yield. It can be up. How many fighters do you think, do you think that there's that 10 UFC fighters that just got off it because they didn't want to get busted and now quite a bit. And I wish I knew anything so they got off. I think that, you know, there's, they got busted. I think some guys were just getting off to get off because that's like you said, that was part of the game. A lot of fucking people just air rights in every sport. Like, I mean you go to any sports.

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       Do you think it is personally in MMA? MMA maybe turned off. Sorry, I get distracted that she called that bitch. She's a beast. She is she fun? Sacramento. She's got those 50 tree trunk legs. 50% don't do starlets I lead. Depends on weight class it true. I wasted it cost all the way. The storage is a prominent 85 why the weight class has an issue with Lacey? Why that would be, I mean, I mean look at the guys. If you just look at people who've been caught, it's usually the heavier weight class. It's true when that, when that Allie bug attain off got caught. That Russian dude on EPO. What the fuck? You're 125 pounds. What are you going to take? Anybody with mighty mouse and he's, his game is very kinetic. If you don't have the cardio at 125 pounds, you got to a GPO for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       Just go do something and you know what it is. Oh Man. I think it's first fight that he's fighting five rounds. Probably worried about that and also he's very physical, like everything he does like hundred percent where mighty mouse is loose. Fuck, I know. I hear you. I get all this. These are all great points. You're 125 pounds. Yeah, you're right. You're right. 100 apps audio four days and I don't give a fuck if you're 300 pounds or 200 pounds or you're not supposed to cheat. Okay? So he cheated. He fucked up, he did a bad thing and he cheated. And when you're cheating, it's not just that a, everybody's doing it. Here's the deal. You're going to be able to do damage that you wouldn't have been able to do. Let's just be honest that your opponent is going to suffer if you cheat. The reality is it's not like football.

Speaker 1:          00:22:24       It's not like you're getting across the line quicker. You're going to land shots that you wouldn't have been able to land. I mean, all speculation aside about individuals that we can see pre and post getting popped when we visited. Plenty of examples to draw from. We don't need to talk about any of them, but the reality is they're, they're bad because your opponent can get hit when they might not be getting hit. But this is the problem is the training like Vituro, Belmore spinning heel kick. Well, if he's on steroids, he's gonna be able to practice that. Yes, 500 times more thousand times before. So it's going to be in his wheelhouse now. Now it's well in his book of tools. So what was crazy on steroids? My patio one a hundred cards. He got legal testosterone, which is so squirrely. The fact that they allowed that for so long. So squirrely. Look, the shit works. And especially when you're on like [inaudible] de Devito or had 1475 was his blood level. A normal person's like 600 that's like a healthy man. Not In training. When you're in training, you're worn out. You're beat down, man. 200 300 yeah. So when you're jacked up like that, yeah man, you can make some gains. You can make some shit out. Welterweight now. I love the train would be sort of good guy. He looks like you're welcome. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       not count them out. Hell no striking. It's nasty in the fucking head is striking is nasty. What if he goes down really easily? Afraid to death. Terrified. Then they'll drop. They're going to just say, I'm going to stay on. If I get off, I'm going to get crushed. So I'm gonna stay out of trouble man. Cause Weidman's not on that shit. And Wyman is a fucking monster. He's a total match up. Even if he was on steroids, so horrible. And now you've been fighting on steroids, you're off of them and you've got to fight five rounds with kids. Why? There's any guys that are on steroids, but they're really, really vocal about being anti steroids. Oh Scott. Because most guys that are on, that's like gay dudes who are anti gay preachers. They always exist. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:24:43       Mother fuckers. Most one of the fighters are almost all, have you seen the African? I'm like God, Awful Macaque. Oh man, look at that. Macaca was in this dude's corner. Macaca was still rocking it after all these years. Macaca knocked out Jocko Ray and Jack Gary's first MMA fight, man. Yeah, that too. It's been all round. He had wars with Palae back when Paleo was the fucking man with Paleo was the shoot the box man palae brought in Anderson Silva. Apparently that's the word. He was a bad ass back then. Wasn't married when he knocked out Matt Hughes. That pains. Goddamn Palae was, he had vicious moy. Tai Vicious does that. Drake, Jake, Jake is, his name is Lucas Martine's. Both of these, both these guys are tough as shit. Darren Elkins is just fucking country tough straight countries. He's one of those dudes. You fucking, you, you meet him in some dirty honky tonk with saw dust on the floor. Come on man. You to do this. Do this outside. I'll be right back. I'm gonna knock this first part. He hit him in the forehead. You're handbrakes. He smiles at yellow. You still wanting to do this, didn't you? Doesn't get tired. It takes bombs. But he's got fight. Drake.

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       Drake makes shit rhyme. Really good. 25 sitting on 25 mil. He's a good wrestler to those wrestlers, man. Get guys who have that background in fucking amateur wrestling is so used to,

Speaker 4:          00:26:24       I went into a wrestling room the other, uh, the other day, my kickboxing coach, Jennie part in Rumiyah Danza, he's got a handful of titles are shit. His daughter's a freshman and we're sitting at the pool and bell rings. I'm like, oh, this has got, you know, wrestling practice. And I was like, what the freshmen at the fucking high school so about like we're going to the room and go in there and check all these fucking kids. And I realized why I'm so fucked up. The wrestling, that's what fucked up your head. Oh, it just made me crazy. Sitting some hot ass room, fucking getting tortured and getting beat up. My, my coaches are world champion and 17 from Iran and then he left. He left the country and then couldn't wrestle in the Olympics, which she probably would have won because he didn't have his green card. So he would bring in all these super bad ass as to just kicked the shit out of me. My whole high school career, they have a deep, deep background in wrestling. Man, they fucking tortured me. Iran. It's just, remember the iron sheik?

Speaker 1:          00:27:16       Yes. She legit wrestling. She was legit wrestling. I had them in a car. Not Kidding you man. He was a world class. He's a good dude, man. Is he came on stage with me in Toronto. I did this. We'd start this. We'd show in Toronto, they do the show. It's like the underground comedy show. They do it in a weed store and the the weed store is up like a bong shop in the front and a comedy club in the bag. And you go into the back and you can't see 10 feet in front of you. You are in the clouds. Man. I'm not joking. It's ridiculous. It's the worst hotbox ever. No ventilation whatsoever. Every now and then again they opened up the back door so nobody dies. That's it. There's no air. You're breathing, you're breathing in, breathing out weed. It's, the whole room was filled with wheat and the iron sheik was in there getting high as fuck. And he came on stage while I was up there. He came in and he fucking this, this is all your video of it online. It's hilarious. And me and him

Speaker 4:          00:28:22       talking on stage, but yeah, Iranians. So imagine me at 15, 16 cut weight and I fucking Sana and I have some 40 year old Iranian dude massaging me, read my backend and credit card down all my sweat and people looking at us like, what the fuck? Why is that man

Speaker 1:          00:28:39       making a choice? Sweat boy cracks him sir. You can't buy him that way. He'd be muttering to meet the Farsi. You can't just scan him Sir national clash over. If you want to fuck him, you're going to have to hold him down. I realized the same 24 hour fitness we always went to in Aliso Viejo was a gay hangout hollow. This is getting ready mapper. Eddie, Eddie and I worked out at 24 hour fitness and there was this dude who was the manager. There was a cool guy. We just talked to him and uh, they had sent him over from the Santa Monica Place. He was like a real personable, real friendly guy. Like he, you know, real easy to like. And so, uh, the Santa Monica police brought him in because they needed to get that place cleaned out because it had basically become just a fuck house closed the shower hose him down everywhere. It'd be common condos, all mark comm. But my buddy up working, that's how I find out

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       I, but I ended up working at the same place and they used to have to trap dudes, gay dudes that were fucking in the sauna and stuff and raped the cops told you until the cops came because there was [inaudible] stations. How people die, Bro. Don't trap me in the assignment.

Speaker 5:          00:30:01       So are you ready? You Ready? You Go. Let me out of here, man. Take a picture of you with the meme. Don't make me fuck my way. It me, me of that place. Just a blurred out.

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       Oh Shit. That's funny. Oh Shit. That's funny. Fuck this dude is doing such a good guy. And he was telling us that basically the gay guys had just had a run on the place. They would just dominate in the place there was cause it was all of them. And they realize, I don't think he's an administrate here.

Speaker 5:          00:30:48       Rock out with their cocks out.

Speaker 3:          00:30:49       I mean, I guess they had probably had some gay managers and they had to clean that shit up and they brought in our friend.

Speaker 2:          00:30:53       I had to work out there once. The gym that I normally worked out, they closed it for filming and I was with Larry. This is back in the Larry Days and let her go do, let's just fucking go to the West Hollywood when I don't do it, I'm not going to the West Hollywood one. I've never been that. You just hear the story. I heard these stories. I had to get that workout in and then he talked me into it and go, fuck it. Let's just go in there real quick. This, this, this guy our chest on and get the fuck out. I swear to God, I was standing there, me and Larry were working on were like benching like a 45 player on each side and a guy next to me had nothing. I just had the everywhere and he asked me, no, he just asked me this. What is this for?

Speaker 5:          00:31:31       I go to for your chest and your packs.

Speaker 3:          00:31:37       Why does it make my boss wanting to be filled your chest? I'm like, okay, fuck, this. Just sounds like they're having a good time and someone fucking hated on him. He's a snitch, man. So, well, there was one straight dude who worked out there. They're like, can we get his dick sucked in the sauna? Bullshits my fucking home jam up. I'm just looking at this apartment is a gym right next door. The guys from Wisconsin that doesn't know shit about fucking Santa Monica Boulevard here. It looks really fit. I guess I'm in a fit community. Everyone's walking around with Jean shorts. Jean shorts is, might be the case thing. There's a million things right here. You have to, you have to be sucking a dick while your roller to make it carrier Darren Elkins

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       probably happen.

Speaker 3:          00:32:31       Yeah, it's happened for sure. Someone sucked a Dick while rollerblading. 100% a hundred percent yeah. There's probably been a dude that was mounted on a dude's face, like he's a flying triangle

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       while they were open his face, whether we're rolling down Venice Boulevard, it's probably happened in all the years that there have been blowjobs and roller blades. It's for sure it happened. What percentage of flights, domestic flights have gay sex going on him. 1% they're all gay during which ones? Cause I got a day love fucking anonymous. You know what? If, if we were all gay, we would all be under the same shit. Gets guys were guys would be [inaudible] be as tight. What are they known for? Anonymous sex in bathrooms and, and uh, uh, bath houses and all that. That's totally normal. That's how we would all be if we were all good. If I was gap, probably be doing the same. My question is even if you're not getting down to that kind of stuff, here's a few gals out there that just don't follow the rules and a lot of women give rules.

Speaker 1:          00:34:02       I don't think I'm with you buddy. I'm not trying to cock block here. I'm just trying to let you know how the, how the gals were looking at it. I would take one of these bitches is fucking ruining the curve. That's why legalize prostitution moves into a country. Chicks just get married. Like look, we just kind of lock this down. We just, let's just, this is what it is. Lost value about to legalize prostitution. The, the overall consensus of women that might have been worried there on the, and understand like some girls don't even care. Like I don't care what it cause don't you see what this means? Do it start calling Debo of horse. They just locked up. They be like God damn it. Like hey do not want to see daisy chain like crazy. Zero power and countries like in Argentina they're just, they have zero power. There's nothing. Well that's not a good thing. Conquering countries. That's what it was like the back of the Gingiss con days, feminism is what's keeping prostitution is illegal because of who came illegal. We just blocked them all on Twitter. We'd never have to hear a word of [inaudible] over there.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       Why are feminists listening to your shit? Cause I got, I got talk shit to you for awhile by some feminists. You know what man, I'm a homophobe or jam. Not, no, you're not home. I'm not into anybody WHO's only into one gender. Look at this. He shouldn't go with Ninja trick right there from the top. They're like, oh, I get it around. He had his elbow like in front of it instead of behind it. I, you know what I feel like, man, I'm not into dudes who are in the men's rights either, but guys who identify themselves as really beat, he's going for it again. And the other side of you guys who are really into men's rights, like I'm, what do you mean this groups? Men's rights. Happy. I was insulted by feminist and commodity an Mra and I did it. I didn't even had a conversation with her.

Speaker 1:          00:35:59       She misconstrues my point. I'm not a men's right. I didn't even know what a Mra was, so I had to look it up. I thought it was like one of those meal packages you get when you were in the army Mre. Yeah. But it was a, um, it's a fucking bomb that hasn't been exploded. It was the fucking men's rights advocate. And I went, no way. Is that what she's saying? And then I'm like, wow. How ironic is it that a feminist would be mocking a guy who's into male rights? Like are you telling me that the men don't have any, like what does that mean? Men Don't deserve rights? Like how could you be mocking someone? Oh, you're one of those dumb dumb Mri or Mra is cause some of the shit that [inaudible] very sexy to that picture. Qut. Good day on the Camry stud muffin look perfectly bronzed.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       Yeah, man. You know, I'm, I don't, I think that a lot of feminism feminism is women who identify themselves with being a feminist and as soon as you start doing that, it becomes like a thing you do. Like I'm in the car. Yeah. I in the fucking, I love bowling. You know, find something like feminist blogger. Okay, well, you know, I like to play pool now. It creates, it's like you're trying to like break that wall down. Now you're creating a wall, a door and shit like that, you know? Or it lets you know not hanging out with her. It's just too much work. Boyfriend, no guy's gonna put up. Yeah, those guys are put it flopped you there. No, no guys. I know there's a lot of social with it called social justice warriors. These social justice warriors. Yeah, White Knights. It's, it's all men that, you know, under normal circumstances would starve to death.

Speaker 1:          00:37:41       They would, if we were all in the hunting parties, we would there be limping back there. We'd send them when people like that should be fucked up. There was something bad would happen if I'm eating it, but they don't cities about good or bad. It's good. Right? Good. Stop. And why isn't, why isn't vitamin water? Cause they used to get, why didn't they blasting that for some reason? No one knows that you Stevia, Stevia, the sugar to other stuff too. But they use Stevia but they don't. You would think that they would set, man, we're missing a good fucking fight, man. For sure. I was getting blown up. It's not good. It's got good shots. Yeah. No he will. He's landed. He can take it, man. That's part of the style. Oh, that head rocked him. And that was behind the ear to oh on the chin with that one. He's just so damn tough man. So hard to finish that dude.

Speaker 1:          00:38:45       That was why it was so impressive when he, uh, he lost a Mendez. Mendez lit him up, man. Mendez look like a monster in that fight. Who's taking men? Does anyone taking Mendez? Nope. I like you guys' style. Going to have a coffee you guys style. He says it's a little bit like a drag racer though. Fucking well. So it was all done by the way. All those are three round motherfucker. And then the last two rounds he like Ricardo Lamas was on top of him. I'm beating his ass in that fifth round. And that's reality. The thing is they say all the strides he's made, which done him wrong. He has, he's not TJ. He's not going to move like that. Beat his more power. I feel like though. Oh, she definitely does, but I just don't see, I think all those two good. And I think although has always been better than Brown anyways, technically because he's so, he's so precise, you know, or browse on moral child and good.

Speaker 1:          00:39:33       But I think that I don't, yeah, I don't think Chad can eat, although I think it's, I just think that, uh, that, you know, he's, he's, he doesn't move like Tj, he's not gonna. He's not gonna outstrip all though, which I think he, he thinks he's got a master splinter in his corner though I was wrong. I was going to get beat up so I wasn't on there. What do you think about fucking Dominick Cruz? God Damn. Did he look like a beast? Proud of him, man. Oh my value on the Steven Bro. I brought in Daniel Cormier eight, then my camp. Yeah, I saw the photo. Yeah. And he brought in a, uh, Dominic Cruz with them. How much trying to show us this footwork. He's like the shop. This is what you gotta do is show me in DC like real quick, man, your waist smaller than us.

Speaker 1:          00:40:15       That stuffs, it's just not going to fit our wheelhouse because it's trying to do that shit. Travis. Travis moves a lot like that, I guess. I mean that's like saying yeah and I throw a right hook like Mike Tyson. Yeah, we both throw right hooks, you know what I'm saying? It's like, Geez man. Paul said it's pretty good at that Dominick Cruz thing. He's all right. Oh, I mean it's a far cry from the original. Dominick Cruz took it to another Dominick Cruz level the other day though. I've never been so happy for another fight of that. That's I don't train with. I was so happy for him. That kid showed zero hesitation too. He came out guns blazing. Just got them tough guys too. That's all east. I know you're Riaa finished him, but he got his back and choked him and you know Mitchell [inaudible] and not just not the same kind of grapple you're riding and it was all pro bring in DC into the camp.

Speaker 1:          00:41:07       Don't look at that fucking Combo. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure it's here. La. Yeah. What is it like working out with him and how's his knee? Because he's 100% yeah, it's this pressure he brings. I've never seen anything like it. I've trained with a, you know, I've trained with a ton of guy. That's cane dude. The pressure, he just keeps coming and keeps coming. Keeps coming. That's him and came man. Those guys. Two werewolves. Yup. Who keeps coming fucking seeking each other. I brought core man for my camp and he's a monster. Watch them spar. No, I wish. I'd love to see that. I've seen some videos and them spar is goddamn ridiculous. Watch is for war chaos, eating each other's style, the same style, knowing me get ground the same style and both guys are going 100% I mean they're, they're fucking going to war and I wonder about that man.

Speaker 1:          00:42:00       I don't, I don't, you don't. There's obviously you can't fuck with the results. Cain is the best heavyweight next to fade or ever. Right. I mean there's fate or him and that's it. And I would love to see the two of them together. And who knows what the fuck would have happened. I didn't. You know, who knows? If you watched the two junior dos Santos fights since the first fight, you wouldn't think that junior could knock 'em out. But junior knocked him out and anything can happen. Fader was a risk taken. Motherfucker feto would, he would get wild on your ass and bricks on the end of his hand through those casting punches. Yeah, he was. He's never scared, never scared. He waited in ferocious. So that guy could, he mean he literally could have beaten anybody when he was at his badge. Okay. Keynes injuries.

Speaker 1:          00:42:39       It's kind of like, yeah, well he keeps beating the shit out of his body. No, 100% they're going a hundred percent man. I, I've told my sprawling down in my career, I'm 30 now and I'm old, but I've just been fucking injured a lot. Well, there's a lot of people to think that the sparring is one of the unnecessary aspects of strength and conditioning that people overdo because you're so, you're beating each other up so much and there's so much trauma that you, if you just as you reach a point of diminishing returns, like yeah. Are you tough? Yeah. Can you mentally deal with it? Cause you're dealing with a regular basis. Yes. But could you be 2% better if he didn't do that? Could you be three, maybe five? I don't think you can take it completely out, but you can't, you can't take completely, nope.

Speaker 1:          00:43:23       No Way. No chance. You can do like a Manny Pacquiao spars. Only the last four weeks of camp, a really, really spot or the last six weeks of camp. I do a, we cannot, we only spread the last six weeks of camp. And how much, how many times a week do you spar? Once, once a week. That's that. Once a week we're bringing some hell raisers, man. As long as you launch the songs, you're simulating scenarios using techniques that are going to come up in a fight and win them over. You know, Eddie always talks about this, about how if you just fucking, everybody loves to roll, but if you just drilled more, it would make you so much more successful at your roles and it's really essentially the same way with any martial art. I mean with kickboxing you if you just beat the shit out of each other all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:44:05       Yeah, I guess you're probably going to get better because you're putting a lot of attention to it, but if you work out with a really good, like rob came in type coach or Duane Ludwig type coach who takes you through very specific drills. Once you're actually sparring and you land that left to the body, it's like your right leg is coming around. Whether you think about it or not, it's just there. It's just a part of your, your your body's memory and I think that we still don't know what the right way to do this shit. You guys are. Do you two guys are like experimental projects 10 years from for Real, right? You guys are the new breed of them. Amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:44:44       Little spider man. He's jacking off and shit. Not every shop you like one of those fucking killer chimpanzees they found in the car in the Congo, six foot tall dick trying to fuck me. See the same world as you know about those no devil nuke. They have these over the last like since like the 90s they found these chimps in the Congo that they've always talked about. They had a photo of one that was shot and like the early 19 hundreds they call him the Bondo ape. It's an enormous chimpanzee, a completely different genus stands up. They stand up and they have a crest on their skull just like a gorilla does, but their chimps and they sleep on the ground. They don't give a fuck. No. Locals. Locals call him lion killers. They say there's two. They have a video of one apparently eating a leopard.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       They have two different types of chimp. They call them tree beaters and lion killers and these align killers and there are giant six foot tall, 350 pound chimps and they sleep on the ground like this lump in there, Dick, why they pass out and everything just fucking steers clear of these crazy fucks. Thank, I think of a chimp how strong a chimp is and they're like 150 pounds. This is double the size, six feet tall, super smart. They have pictures of them all over the Internet, like walking, like walking like a person there's, or this Carl Armand is ago, Swiss wildlife photographer. And he found photos of them and like spent years looking for them. But apparently it's an incredibly remote part of the Congo that's super difficult to get to. But just now these people that are fucking risking their lives in this crazy shitty part of the world, these aggressive, oh, of course they are.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       One of them. There's a fucking great story about these scientists that went down there and one of them made a fucking a bluff charge at them and it just, they didn't move. You can't move. You're dead anyway. So just you got to stand your ground because if I move back up, if you do back up there for sure. Gonna fuck you up. They rip your nuts off first. Oh yeah. They know the genitals base. Yeah. They know what works. They know what you like. Early UFC rules, they're smart as shit. They're like halfway between a person and an animal, but ripping balls off. You had, if you had a monkey, there was 150 pounds. He wanted to fuck you up. You'd be in a giant problem. He would probably kill you most likely to rip you apart. Imagine something twice that big twice that big and super aggressive and the locals call them lion killers and we just barely know about these things.

Speaker 1:          00:47:09       They have DNA from them. They have some photographs and some videos, but they barely know these fucking things exist in a very difficult spot to get to. It ended up as the pet training partner. That monster, well I your mom, Bondo Abe's to train with next podcast. He trained with Bondo a take babies and then train them and bring them up. They can't take them. If they're already adults, forget it. Hannibal Lecter masks on their face. I get crazy in the middle of training time. He doesn't buy it, but what he bites it would be a hammer fist and a wheel kick at the same time. Can you imagine if you taught a chimp how to do a gay teen?

Speaker 1:          00:47:59       Pop your head off, especially with a big giant ones. Dario, throwing a decision. Holy Shit. Brazil. It's stuff to do. Wow. We were barely paying attention. Now let's be honest. We're talking about a month is biting dicks off son. Yeah, I still thinking of that. You tried to fuck everyone. You're trying to fuck that bondo way, but who's going to get, who have failed those son Joseph Havi. Who's he fighting? He's fighting someone good. That's right. Nate Diaz coming back in at that shit. Nate Diaz coming back. Joe Sanchez is a monster. Yeah. He's tough as shit, dude. I can't believe knocked out Henderson. That was fucking nab cowboy. Yeah, he beat kicked about it, man. He's a beast. He beat a couple of guys. He's beating quite a few really good guys. But knocking out Benson, this fucking huge man. Fabio Maldonado was always fun to watch Human Zombie history before.

Speaker 1:          00:48:52       I see this is paper view. The old body shot, Maldonado don't play. He's got really good left hook man. Look how smooth his boxing and he's a perfect example. The the exact opposite of a guy like boggle teen off. He's a big guy. I mean he's fighting, you know, two oh five but yet he's like super light and relaxed with his punches. He made a big mistake. Fucking Steve Bay though. Boy Did he have a choice? No, I'm saying he asked for that animal. Look at that picture up there. That's the bond. That was one that they found that was one they shot in like the early 19 hundreds so you can get a picture of that, a better picture of that. Cause they show like it's whole body. But if you look at the other one, Jamie, there's one that they shot at an airport recently, these two guys and they're standing in front of it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:36       So you get a perspective shot. Thing is in that picture you're talking about and the airport. Well there, that's a different one. That's one of the caught on the camera trap. But this picture of one that they shot, it's actually dead and these dudes are standing with this thing and you look at it and you go, they kills that. I probably could have. They could. I mean they were living in the Congo. They eat Champps there. They eat whatever kind of meat they can get. I saw you're a real sports. No, that's, that's another image in one two. You have the real sports? No, there's just look up Bondo ape. And if that doesn't work, look up [inaudible] A, B I. L I a Bondo. A shop training partner. You'll see one. There's an image search. You got it. The one with the does a dead one. There it is. Look at the size of that fucking thing. Look at the size of that fucking thing back up so you can see it's balls. Back up a little. Look at that Stack Zack and

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       cock. How'd they kill it to shatter your, they didn't kill it with a fucking wiffle ball bat. I'll tell you that. You better shoot that thing. Look at this fucking muscles on that goddamn thing. It's gorilla. He's smiling to deliver. Are they bigger? Grills are bigger, but that's, that's the real aside for a chimp that is fucking enormous. That's like a really big man. That's a set of tits on him. He's got his arms, dude. Those are like your legs. Just Dick. He can look at that fucking package. It's just all but solver. That's all up in your face thing like his leg to the left. That fucking picture. She frees me up, man. Left stomach. That's his CAC at this cap rate. That's easy. Well, they don't have big dicks like people do, Bro. People that have big balls because the ball's side, this is actually scientific fact. That ball size of directly proportionate to the amount of promiscuous females in the region includes human beings and he in villages where human women are more slutty. The human men grow bigger balls. Swimming. That's your huge ego balls important. My girlfriend, I just, I was like, you know what, to call this out of state. Exactly. Go out of state.

Speaker 3:          00:51:54       Small town girl. Well, there's too many people in Orange County. They have to fuck. There's too much traffic. They just do it. It's true. It's just fuck. Can't wait for my boyfriend to get here. Come on over. He's stuck in traffic for the next two hours. So Fabio Maldonado versus Han stringer. Anybody know anything about stringer, stranger, stranger to know in the UFC? Is it strange with the Black Zillion? He's about to get punched. The fucking another lens. It's going to be a standup boy for sure. He has a couple kids, a victory over a fence and Mark Barroso and one of the fight nights. Third round decision. Hmm. Well done. Not was a fucking bad ass. Oh, he's a beast, dude. His boxing is really slick. Remember when he clipped Glover Glover's lightened him up, dude. Lighten them up and then he catches him with a left hook and as Glover doing the chicken dance.

Speaker 3:          00:52:45       But he's just so tough, man. So this is a guy you don't want to have a conversation with when he's 70 was too tough. He, those guys are too tough where they take them postman, you're like stop this. Yeah. When he's 70 and he's drunk and you and him are sitting there and he puts his hand on your need to tell your story and does that clamp the clamp on your knee when they spent time, Bro, I fucking told him. I told him I'm not going down. I'm not going down. Tells the same stories. Are there any, are there any legends have speech. No comment. Or it could be like that old dude that beat the fuck out of that young boxer with the long hair.

Speaker 3:          00:53:30       Like you never see that video. Oh my God. I was like 16 he fuck with a old man back. He had old man back hunch shrimp, shrimp and I was like, Oh fuck this guy screwed. Screwed. Yeah. When he slipped the Jack, the Jack God damn world. Ah, Ooh. There's that. That level of boxing you get to where your eyes are open as the punch hits. You ever seen those pictures of like old school? Roberto Duran is a photo of him as a punches hitting him. His eye is wide open and he's throwing a counter shot cause the punches hitting him. He's turning his head and planned. I mean those, when you hit that level it's just you're so relaxed. And that old man, old man was used to getting punched. It wasn't a new experience. Fuck hey did. He didn't have to one out. He was going out and bad boys been around for fucking ever and it hadn't seemed like they've really, you know why? Because so many dudes tattooed on their body to go look, we've got to keep kids.

Speaker 3:          00:54:38       Are they making any Mary Horn as a bad boy tattoo? And you know what, if you think about it, that really is like the coolest thing for, I'm a bad boy. Everybody wants to be a bad boy. Girls like bad boys coming to Jitsu or like a Brazilian thing. Cause I remember in like 88 I remember I had like a pair of shorts and it was rude. Boy got with like spiky Johnny Bravo here. Come with like a spiky like this. Probably those bands back in the 80s. Rude boy that I remember. Do you remember when that was first and that was born in the 80s. So I don't know how he gets all fucking old Dan. Daniel born in the 80s. Fuck Pussy. When you were coming out of pussy. Yes. Hollow. I be your father speaking. It could be your father if school I made 84 84. It was when I was just starting to get fussy so I could have fucked up and shot one into my girlfriend. Jesus Luisa. Speaking about shooting one powerful genetics. Here we go.

Speaker 3:          00:55:51       If anybody's to us, they take our don't like Brazil and that's why I'm not there. It couldn't be more further from the truth. I love Brazil. Escalate the ground right away. I love going to Rio. I just, I didn't have the time this week and I had family obligations. I just couldn't make it. I had to how to stay in town. Damn kids. Well it's that, um, there's no things I can't talk about, but a lot of stuff going on out on the grounds. Got a bad ass hole dudes. Was that judo video? Real amazing. Mine too. Have you seen that video? I took your fucking mind Jamie. Pull that shit up. That old dude video of a, the old dude doing judo. These guys are trying to toss him and he's moving like water just flowing around them and he's like in his sixties and other old dude in his 60 when you know you're almost dead, you give zero fucks.

Speaker 3:          00:56:39       You're not protecting your ACL. He's just out there letting it hang, you know? And I tried to fucking, I got to fucking rotator cuff injury. I just going to let this dude take me down, wipe off my back more times in a row. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. The guy's technique is just stellar. It's also, there's, this is a potential of watching that video that they're his students and sometimes when you row with your students, the students almost have like a give up on the Quito death touch and have those guys and just like flipping this is different. Yeah. What are they about? They're all crazy. Don't brainwash. Totally brainwashed. Yeah. How about your boy hunt getting the title shot? Fuck yeah. Do you know why? Do they make an agreement like Bunko with it and do they talk about it or is it unfold or these like a cult thing. You know what I'm saying? Drink this Koolaid so never really sat to [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:57:42       Cool. Right. I don't even think I've ever talked about that. Let me think. You have to do that. That's an important fucking seminar. Again, good right off the guys that would do it. You can't go back to the fucking check. You call up the assholes who are going to fall down. I would never be able to pull that word off. I don't even know what I knew what you meant. Like right when you said I go, I seen that online. I never really played that game. I mean I did a few times, but not enough to call her Duke and Fabio is getting tagged with that elbow at the top. Big Old Dutchman. Brazil is not happy. Big Brown. When you get into half guard position in this spot here, do you ground and pounded you try to pass. I looked for submission from half guard. Most most guys, most guys like to ground and pound here, especially wrestlers cause you can really control. Got To half guard. Especially in MMA. True. I agree. I like, I like to give them this Sunday like I did with metro and I give him the under hook and I looked for my doors. I looked for the neck or that come up now his dark especially at heavy label.

Speaker 3:          00:58:59       Look at this, look at this. Nice with the hooks man. Nice with the hooks. Oh beautiful job. Beautiful job. Good control. Yeah. I don't care. I think mounts overrating them and man I'll show some amount of you. You'd be fine. 100% just slide data was Shankar. When did you try to regain half guard? Yes. Why or or create a scrambled number. Why would you try to regain half guard if cause I can get up. Even the viewer and how the model was a deep half. He would stay, he was pacing is on top, get out and I don't know what it meant. What I'll do is I'd create a scramble. I give him the under hook to a scramble to get their neck or and all. You hear what I'm saying? I see what you're saying. If you don't want a mouse because it's an, it's worse than being in someone's half guard.

Speaker 3:          00:59:40       Then if you were being mounted, why would you put them in half guard? You would. You should just leave it. I think it depends on the style. Depends on who. It depends who you're fighting too. That makes it fighting for doom. You don't let that motherfucker mountain know. I don't think he let anybody fucking mountain you ever when you're in the mountain, naturally as a fighter you want to recover half guard. At least it depends. It depends who you're fighting. So there's guys, guys mouth to create scrambles, but you, you have a pretty good just for awhile. So if you were mounted on a purple belt, you'd be pretty happy with it. Right? If you were mounted on the guy who just, maybe he was a notch below you, you would take that and you'd stay there. It was an MMA fight, right? Yes. So the difference between that and the guy was really good. Is it that your mount is not good enough or is it, no, I think in MMA because when the strike in the show, because your grape vine, right? And you find the guy out if you're not going to get heavy strikes in, right. So you were kind of just sitting there or if you're of a doom guy, you're looking for some issue that cross your feet underneath, like a guard from the top amount, like a mouth guard.

Speaker 3:          01:00:46       If you're doing guy, you'd go for selection. Okay, let's listen to Ian because everybody, what's your philosophy on it? I'm just better at punching and passing and everybody else in my division. So it's, it's not, it's easy for an amount pass mount. You're trying to recover. I'm going to try them out again. Try and Matt again. Why do you want it? Why are you trying to get to the mountain? It's a dominant position and I can punch you from there and I can get you to, the person gets tired, you know, they, they start to panic and they start a square and I take their back and do whatever, but I can kind of float above somebody in the, in the belly punch elbow and I mean they get that guy to work so much when you can float over him and hit him with needs of the body or whatever it is you're, you're hitting the guy that you can't do that from half guard.

Speaker 3:          01:01:30       He can, you said you couldn't scramble that amount. You're on neon belly. You let them turn. I'll do like the, you know, the, the, the cross my feet, if I get locked them down a lock them down and then just punch him, elbow him and look for a submission. But I don't mind it that people are, if they're starting to scramble like that and I'm on top of him, it's such a dominant position. I can just, I just hold people down. I agree. And they just said no. I'm saying when you, when you place your feet like that, you're not finishing and guy was strikes. You mean when you butterfly or when you, when you bring up finishing high level grappler from mountain. He's going to get out guys. But dude, there's some guys when you grapevine, there's things that have like a crazy hyperextension in their back.

Speaker 3:          01:02:12       I've seen guys who flattened guys out with great flatten them out, but they can still fucking blast from the top. There's a few guys, lot of games when there's no nasty, you gotta be able to sit up. You got to have a calculated game going on. I agree. Like what are you doing when there's not punches in the mountain? Big Brown. Why are you not trained with Eddie Bravo? You need to get your fucking ass over to 10th planet. Get a couple of lessons. Just talk. Don't talk about it. Be about in Venice, man, he can't make it. That's incredible dude. It's a total drunk. He can't be expected to Lawrence County a wrestling reign training center.

Speaker 3:          01:02:50       That was the first time we met. I was still hanging out. There's a lot of 10th planet Jiu Jitsu down there. Tony Ferguson transcend a header a heater on, right? Everyone knows this. Yeah, I got a crush on him to do it. How to do it with you. I got a question. I'm, I don't want to go down to Orange County. Listen what you're saying. Everything you're saying about the Verdomme guy. Yes, correct. But everyone should strive to be the Verdugo guy. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm striving to be the redeemed guy. I'm with you. Jujitsu is my passion. I moved here. When you get out on Travis Brown, he's not getting that. He's not a Brendan shop on the ground, but to do that to everybody. I agree, but it like whoever Brazilian, why everyone. I'm still, if I'm going against a high level Brazilian and I can get them out, I'm like, if you've got damn mountain and go, Holy Shit, I'm dominating this fucking with, you know, if it's there, but I, I'm never going to stay in half guard if I can get them out.

Speaker 3:          01:03:42       I want to get to the mount because you're in some deep shit and the mountain. There was a lot of games with your brother. But what happened? Punk Shit in half guard. Well, you're just nasty. Overall. The overall and MMA have you look at all the fights, not that many fights and from you put all the time a fight is in, in half guard, top happen. MMA most of the time nothing's happening. It's at the boring shit. And that in that respect, in that same argument, most of the time when you're in guard, it's bullshit. And I agree with nasty. I agree with his half guard. His fucking top game from half court is very good. He's a very shift. That's a beautiful thing. His is, he put material on asleep. That's a beautiful thing. You know, half guard, Doris, half guard, uh, Japanese Necktie, half guard guillotine fuck your half guard.

Speaker 3:          01:04:25       That knee bar to hell. Yeah. Hell yeah. But also all sorts of gain from side control. There's a whole, for sure the loves and the whole system from the mouth. And then the back is a whole nother book. No fights. All that in front of Dina and he's not watching. He's watching the Monitor. It's a weird thing. He's watching the Monitor. How dare you, Eddie Bravo. But it's weird thing you do. Sometimes the fight is on in front of you, but you're watching a monitor in front of us and three screens and we're talking about we're talkers in Argentina, but we're still watching it. I'm still watching it. Still awesome chance given to punch people. Maldonado is just fucking excels. I understand what you're saying. Sneaky take sexually strong. He's got a little extra, especially at heavyweight other, you know what I'm saying? The show exposed to that heavyweight. I, I would say they're less explosive, happy way.

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       I disagree with the explosive guys who guys, I can't, well, I completely agree. Like really know because guys his size, how many I'm playing football. I'll do a solid zero. How many of them to play football? He was like the star people destroying, destroying it. Fucking weight shop. When I'm with the back to the mouth talk, I've got a question about cops, man. They outlawed those tie steel cups in a lot of grappling competitions. Right, because you can fuck a dude up with a cup. So why can't you do training in MMA? It's an MMA. Like when I remember one time I will pause that was wearing a man. What the fuck? Maldonado's given some big look how calm you got to shoot. You got to shoot the perfect devil's pool on top of you. And then when they come back with that wizard, you come up with them right to, he's not looking to do that. So I need to have that skill set. Maldonado was looking to just fucking fire ups. Anderson Anderson up there with them Anderson's in his corner. Come on, come on son. Dude. Bald to know. But you know, you could learn something. Watching him punch like everything was very precise and it like 70% power. Whoever the fuck he wants, he can do whatever you want. He's in Rio. They give suck each other's dicks.

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       He his, his striking from any position is so fucking pinpoint and it looks like it hurts. He had extra snap on it. Like the timing was right, the main boobs. He just smooth. So here's the question. If you could fuck a guy up with a tie steel cup in a grappling competition, like it's a, it's an extra lever. Like if you catch a guy on a knee bar, two inches, it's metal and it hurts. I was rolling the Amir Renovar, he's the only guy I've ever rolled with that rolls with a tie cup on it. He would mount you and stick that fucking tie cup right in your solar plexus in grapevine years death. Cause it's terrible. I never thought of it that I, I've always worn one. Yeah. Well this won't be the nuts. You're going to fucking kick it. Have you ever fucked with those? My question was, have you ever fucked with those like diamond cups?

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       You ever, what do you think about what's better? Diamond or like a steel? I wore it once and I liked it. I just, I think it broke and I never want another one was how long ago was it? Um, a while ago. They better at it now. They did it, but they've done a bunch of changes to them. They're pretty dope, but they were awesome. But I, and I actually put a steel cup inside of mine. Ooh, that's very smart because I liked the way it's set up, but I don't trust plastic. Plastic. Give a fuck about shaped in a steel is a little bit different and especially like they'll say like, oh look, there's a video of someone kicking you. Okay, we'll let Melvin Manhoef kick you in the nuts. Let's, let's let someone who knows how to kick cause I'm watching this kick and I'm like, I'm not that impressed. Yeah. Fuck, let me kick you got proofs that and let me get you. Exactly. I'm only 125 pounds.

Speaker 1:          01:08:19       Yeah. There's a lot of people that say like, hey man, I eat low. Kicks her out. He kicks like you'll eat some kicks, some kicks you can eat, but a Pedro. Yeah, exactly. That's the perfect guy to bring up breaking my coach homework with him. He was a patriot as though striking coach said he kind of hold myths. One can have bad from it kicks on, so you just have to put them on a bag. I sent her warning him, kick a bag at Beverly Hills Jujitsu, fold those motherfuckers Yurts uh, Marco and Marco studio on Oneso just says the guy who folds fucking bags. And this is true. Yeah, I can do that shit too. That's why I'm telling you she had a normal, there's certain dudes that just have a weird power and you, you've either and shit. No, your hips. It's a little bit of, it's a super flexible.

Speaker 1:          01:09:03       So it's his own size too, dude. It's a weird, it's shape. And that's one of the main problems that I have with transgender fighters that fight over in, in women's MMA I should say. Only if they let, if they don't let them know, like that was the issue that I had with Foul Fox. Shouldn't, shouldn't divulge because she didn't think she had to because it was a medical issue. If you know that a chick used to be a dude but it's now a check and you fight her up to us on board, I think it should be legal to ride bulls. I think it should be illegal to jump the Umax. You should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do. I think 135 pound chicks, she'd be able to fight 135 pounds. Dude, I'm think of Ronda Rousey and Bryan caraway talked to nef shit and they decided to go at it.

Speaker 1:          01:09:37       I don't, I don't have any problem with that. If they both agree to it, I'll go up and wait and fight Ronda, but there's, there's the size of the body. It's the shape of the body that's different. It's not just the density of the bone because black women have the same density of bone as white men. It's very similar, almost the same. Very similar, but you know, obviously pro athletes and the guys who strength training are going to have more density in their bones and the average person, if they're measuring, it's a significant difference. But the big difference is the mechanical advantage of the male frame. You don't find a female with super wide shoulders, narrow waist and the same size hips and the same shape. Hips is a man and when you have that kind of body, you could just generate more force. I can look at a dude and tell you whether or not he could be like a man hoof.

Speaker 1:          01:10:23       There's some dudes that just have that just stupid fucking power and you could look at them and go, well he might, he might not like, there might be like a Bobby Lashley. He looks like a fucking brick shithouse but he's not like a shame car went true. But Shane Carlin's, a Shankar Shankar when had that stupid fucking power can't tee up course Jesus Christ. Fuck with a wig on. She fucking bitches. Soon as he stopped when he was in three, four, five in a row and regular MMA like, dude, I'm going to lose weight and fucking chop my balls off. You maximum the that bed, all you would have to do is Holler, dive Schick and punch her in the back of the here and it's over. His hands are not going to shrink and then if they do shrink, what are they going to shrink in 10 years, all the champions in women's MMA will be former.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       Dude, that's so true. Just a stoner question. What do you, what do you, what do you think that's, I like this. Do you think aliens each strictly Gmos or are they vegan? Oh, good question. What do you, what would you think? They'd come down and we find out aliens are really hang down, come flying through space. Would they laugh at vegans? Do they have planets within, are there are designated for organic farming? Do they have like planets? Oh the, I think they bring like farms, like in their, in their ships, do they just absorb energy? You know what I mean? What would they say? What would they say was wrong with the Vegan thing? They go, listen, this is the truth. As long as you're getting all the vitamins and minerals and essential fatty acids and amino acids in a pill form, whatever your weight, your body's going to adjust.

Speaker 3:          01:12:06       These bodies can, we can digest anything. It's all about the vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and essential fatty acids. That's it. You're, you're discounting the possibility that they might not even be biological. I mean, we're getting so close to coming up with artificial skin. They're talking about artificial intelligence, the ability to download someone's consciousness. Who knows when, I mean a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now, whatever the fuck it is, but downloading your, your, your mind is a computer. So you think you were looking at these aliens. We're assuming they're biological, but they could easily transcend biology. If you talk, if you talk about people that lived a million years ago, like, Oh, uh, you know, uh, was Australia piff guess, right? Yeah. The oldest version of human. If you took one of them and showed them an iPhone, they wouldn't know what the fuck to do with it.

Speaker 3:          01:12:49       It would basically be as ridiculous a comparison, the way they live to an alien being some sort of a biological creation or no artificial creation. If they come up with fake cells and then they come up with fake body parts and eventually fake Bot, and eventually maybe it won't enact the same biological processes as a brain or as a, as a, as a Human Bonnie. But it might be something that replicates it in a way where it can be just as conscious and justice productive. So consciousness would have to be something that could be downloaded in a sense, right? A replica. Yeah. Replicated. So you'd make, once you figured that out, she said you'd make fucking copies of yourself. Like you didn't make at least 20 copies mail him. You're fucking your, your relatives about this look like aliens. They all look the same because the hard drive, what are the files?

Speaker 3:          01:13:39       Get corrupted then that's how you die. That's how you kill ever seen alien who got to get their fucking master file. Well, the thing about the killer, everybody's, everybody's version of the alien is essentially the same. It's always a big gray thing with black eyes. Like what if they just all agree like, look, let's just all look ugly. No one's allowed to be hot. We don't have Dick's anymore. So who gives a shit? It just the warm that we won't even one pussy one. Let's just go. Because after a while people hold onto it. You can hold onto the the to hold. Let's do a real fight and we should, we'll fight. That happened yet so we can still touch Phil. Yeah. Phil Davis, this fight and go is this homemade? Slowly you want to shut that hormone off if you don't, that's the thing that kills everybody.

Speaker 3:          01:14:25       That's number Whoville. How fucking life. I'll take this live with the food, but you know what? You could turn it on, turn it on every now and then. Every now and they can go in there, turn on the sex drive, boom. And they're like, damn, I want some to alias alias. You turn it off. They can figure out a way to transcend sex. I mean we say if they don't have sex, fuck them, but what if they come up with some shit that's way better than just thinking about what five your mouth and not as doing tonight. There's no way you want to transcend that. That's going to be beautiful. What he's doing, he's going to do a hundred times and keep forgetting he it. Did I do that? Yeah. The over under on sexual partners for Fabio Maldonado, very payment. I've known, I know famous Brazilian, very famous, not going gonna name any names, but they're crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:15:14       Buck wild. They'll just disappear in your, there'll be with you in an airport, don't meet her chicken airport and just get another flight. Take off with this chick and be gone for a week. This guy is super hardcore and he also, you gotta think like MMA fighters for the most part. You guys could testify to that very impulsive, wild fucking mean. They're not entering into the cage because the fucking accounting gig didn't work out. I get time off. I get tattoos. I do weird shit. I buy cars. I do weird. He's got a muscle car. American muscle cars drive. Prius's I just, I know you have a portion of BMW we tell talking about. I'm getting an American muscle cars. Yeah, I dunno. Thinking been thinking a lot lately. I'm thinking I'm missing that in my life. Get a cobra will. I used to have a Shelby Shelby gt.

Better than the records actually pimped have one and that have never, you know what it does. It's going to be so good. It's not going to be this dude's house.

Did you get like the ultimate one where you can tell I gotta write that down. Stepford wives go admin. If the the robot wives and they clean and do everything they want them to do, look it up, but look it up, it's going to get that what's going to happen. Women Joe's while I watch all that bullshit that like three d simulation thing eventually change the porn industry.

Speaker 3:          01:17:04       It already is. They're already starting to do them. First person porns with those things aren't supposed to be insane hold or right after the show and he's like, I'm in. Where does this for research purposes or knowledge? Well, it'd be Eddie. You could do Jujitsu with that that you could put on an oculus rift positions. You could go through positions. What is the dog? I'm teaching girls Jujitsu.

Have you been on that Joe? Developers? Can I say the new way, the alien game on that? They haven't been to the new one. Terrifying. I heard the alien game is so scary that people think that it should be illegal and you're, you're in the world and pay apparently that worried, legit concern. People are going to have heart attacks. I'll give you, you're an old man. Okay. If you're in your fucking seventies and your video games, there's a lot of big brown again. Why? But they're fun, man.

But talk to take everybody. Yeah. Tough to take down and fucking throws ball. Essentially. Phil Davis, we'll have six striking and he got in there. You just got to keep going way back. Actually he's going to, he's going to figure it all out. It just takes a years. Well he looked great. He met glass and he's in, he's got someone that's fucking scary in front of them. So yeah.

Two of yours just land one of his, it's weird. He looks really good too. The ways of seeing everything. Just slide right out of it. It's like Phil's throwing the shots. He's getting just offline. Just offline, but looking for his openings. Super patient, right. It's trying to get them against the cage. Keep moving sale like that. Daddy's gonna be tough to take it down, man. Look at this, ma'am. Bill Davis might have to pull guard. It's crazy to see these like super high level wrestlers like Phil Davis, like as you know, you're working on your overall MMA game. You're not doing as much wrestling and it's not just a wrestling match.

Speaker 1:          01:21:45       When you start throwing in punches and stuff, there's some guys you just haven't have a really hard time taking down, even if you're as good as rested at wrestling. As David says, he's so fucking good. The distance is different. Is that what the big thing is? Damn. Front kick and a punch behind it. Slowly. He's going to be an amazing strike. Oh, hey, here's a really good, good team, man. That's not as hurt shoulder either. Come on, do this. Phil's Phil might habits to old defense. Oh shit son clovers. Got some dope defense. Look, give me just, Oh shit. No, you walked through that to 40, bringing into the camp. I mean, chuck used to bring in so many fucking bad ass dude. So glad we got so good. Yeah. We uh, well he was the guy who like for six years, everybody wanted to get in the UFC but his visa problem, my rounds while he's getting ready for Mitre, where Leo Machida and Glover Teixeira whatever would come in and he was 240 pounds shilling. Holy Shit. For sure. If I look at this slide and get this, look at this, look at this, look at this and you're this or that. Go. He'd let it go. But look at them. They get slipped. This is how it feels going to win. He's going to wear them out when by decision cause well, you know, I know that I've just been fighting. You see it's also a lot of people were wondering who glow over was training with. Oh, he's getting hard. Hard shots by hard shot. Oh he's, he's eating. He's

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       trying to get her right here too. He's hurt man. His hurt, his caliber on your back, man. David's through Samba bombs right there. He's a bad ass and he's not put the hooks in and chuck, he likes his condition. Can't you can't eat those shots man. Yeah, he's going to get wrestler upper cut it the fuck up. He's getting wobbly. Look, I know who Ian Mccall is rooting for my friend. I like feel too, I'm just better friends with Glover, whatever, bro. I called you out, get up Bro. Going for clover. How many times have you heard about someone that you thought was your friend and they're rooting against you because oh of cause they're one of their buddies. It's like I take it personal and I, it's super personal. Is it happened a few times. Oh yeah. Cause it happens. I'll find out like a certain media guys.

Speaker 3:          01:24:01       So you think are your friends and then for a reason I have to fight. They're like, yeah, why didn't we call it picked mitre owned to Wayne or Travis Brown and when I'm like, cool, I won't do interviews with them anyway. Have either one of you guys trained with Eric Dolphy Arrow? Yeah. What are you thinking about him? And I've known Eric for, I fought for total combat, a lot of shows. Great coach smart. The whole group is a really smart guy. He tried to put it down to do Phil. It's good at, and he keeps Dak tagging him. Look at this. Oh Shit to fill. This is how you feel you're wearing. His head is getting rocked back on these shots. He's a serious shots. Yeah, it feels hit him hard. He's going for it. Even if go over, gets to this round. He's taken a lot of punishment, man.

Speaker 3:          01:24:41       Really hard shots to the head wearing them out. I mean he's, he's, he's blocking these oh shit. Big Round. Phil Davis, huge round. Oh Shit. I feels gas tank pretty fucking good. Totally exhausted. But he comes out strong then you know he's done his cardio right? Cause he looks totally exhausted. Even if he is in phenomenal shape, you're gonna be tied that first round. You're supposed, he's supposed to be talking 100% and try to fuck him up. He's supposed to be tired. It's all about recovering. Yup. That's recovery. How fast in this would be a big victory for David's man. Dude, if he beat the old machine in Brazil, let's say he wins this fight. Glover Teixeira in Brazil, the hell you also be Fabio in Brazil. We, I think we were at that fight for the Stephan Bonner. Oh, front kick up the hand behind it. That was cool.

Speaker 3:          01:25:27       Matt. These are bad though. Those are heavy. There was a few of them that really snapped his head back. That one. One of them we really got wobbled in the second exchange. Look at powerful Vito Belfort. He's not mad at his wife. Never happened. Ever happened acting. Yeah. Well she's like talking about the Brazilian Pam Anderson or something. Something like something along those lines. So these ridiculous Ham Anderson it. She did a fuck load of squats on a staircase. Yeah, I'll blow out as just off the charts. Bootae those chicks have big acids there and they're getting fake

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       asses. If was in those, that's your books to just a modern necessary. Eventually they will be, I don't like him. Eventually they will be, but right now no guy is accepting. Fake out. No, no, not right now. It's too early. I do not. I would not have a flat no ass having crossover conversations folks. Sorry. Big fucking fight going on. How about acid? Sorry. Yeah, fake asses. He comes up to the front. Kick to the face. Good. I don't keep moving Phil. You got to keep moving, man. I don't think women are aware of that. That we will not accept that. You better hide that shit. You can't fail nobody. It ain't like cities. I can tell you a whole factory by your dad will help you with the down payment and all that. Good shot. Good shot. Asked you about to keep that. Wait a minute. Whose Dad's going to help her? Chick with a down payment. What are you talking about? [inaudible] how many times at the Strip club? Orange County. It's beat. You're here all the time but not now. Big Switch. You got to respect the dam.

Speaker 1:          01:27:21       I don't know. It doesn't look like he's got a justice grip. Right? What kind of grip does he have here? Nothing. Kung Fu grip. Oh Nice. It didn't look like he totally had a gripped up. Right. How many more gay teens you think we'd get in the UFC if we had no gloves? How many more submissions? A lot more. A lot more submissions, right. Is I brought this up before it. Do you think that it would be actually be better if he fought with no gloves? You think about what you can

Speaker 2:          01:27:51       elbows, those rubber gloves and the doctor's like, why have anything? If you think about just gloves, dishwashing gloves, so I've been thinking of what's the big,

Speaker 1:          01:28:06       you still have no ankle support, no wrist support, no gloves, no nothing. I think if you fought with no gloves, we would realistically know what punches do in a fight. Right now we don't because right now we have padded up gloves, have hands that are wrapped up together. We have, they do enough changes. It's enough that most people would wear them if they had the option. It helped bring your hands, you break your hands way easier with without gloves here. I think it makes a big difference too in what's effective striking because your, your your knuckles like they don't dig it as much. Your risk buckle a little bit on shots. Whereas if you're wrapping your wrists up and taping it down, you're making it like artificially stiff and it allows you to get, yeah, it allows you to punch harder. I think we get an unrealistic sense of the value of punches because of that. I don't think people are wa I see what you're saying but I don't think people are watching it for that. I think but I don't know if talking about people watching it. I'm talking about for

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       the majority of the sport, exactly. Talking about the spirit of the emotional brain make grappling better, hyper analyzing everything and I always do that but I mean like he was getting rear naked chokes man. Getting rear naked choke is a big difference between clothes on and stuff. That's an MMA that's pretty Dang. This is retarded. Like go home you if you touch, if you touch the ground that you can't need the face, that kind of stuff. There's so many laws that just won't. They never change them and just like you can't wear tight. You can't the laws, you can't have your calf covered because it actually, it's so dangerous. It's crazy. It's illegal. Phil is tired. You have to have the pope to the eye. Damn. I was just about to say that Phil. He blew out so much energy in that first round. He's beating the brakes off of him. He, well, he did a lot of fucking damage. Rick Inglis's. Right. Then you sent the Fernandez when he was 27 Mcgregor's got a pink shirt and tie. Of course he does. I love him. My new favorite fighter. She likes cockiness. Wow. Powerful Aubrey. Good choice.

Speaker 3:          01:30:16       Oh God. Right in the eye with that. Got It. Hate dogs. She's going to be bidding against them. I hope it. Here's another thing. If we're going to have gloves with them, if we're going to have gloves, why the fuck don't they cover the tips of the fingers? Why don't they figure out a way to do that? Because if you're putting, it's kind of help the fingers, man. It's not that much. No problem. It's a big problem, man. I think it's a huge every, how many John Jones fights have there been? I pokes fuck everyone, but even if the fingers were covered, can't you still poke someone's eye but the nails not there. John's pinky fingers, little hover condoms. You're not going to be able to dig in one condoms.

Speaker 3:          01:30:58       They'll still fuck you up. Let me look and see me. I would have finger condom on open up point. You'd be like, damn, I know he got fingered conduit or somewhere to, my daughter accidentally poked him in the eye the other day and I saw sparks gloves on. Like, what's the fucking difference? If they grab their balls, if that grabbed their ass, what the gloves on and they wouldn't do that. They're or, Whoa, Phil Davis is a big takedown. Take your gloves off the rear naked. Every order. New Glucose. Nope. Too High. It's the sink got too high. She's got to drop his hips done, but he doesn't want to lose a position when it doesn't wanna get fucked off. Standing end of the round two there a short time. I thought it was going to do nothing for Phil. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Emma May takes off the gloves. Football takes off the pads and helmets. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:31:55       you guys see that rugby thing with a dude? Kao The dude on the field. He grounded him. Did he hit him with a right hand? Dropped him and then fucking pounded them out from the mouth at a karate tournament. Who takes out both competitors? He's the RAF and he's tried to break it. He's trying to separate them, but like a Russian rep dude, he made karate, looked beautiful. It was a real fight. He was trying to separate them and then you just want blah, blah, blah, and then he kicked the guy. Look days. It's amazing. Name of the video of nursing that maybe if you youtube search karate, karate, Raf. Fight Ref everybody, right? He's in my, it's like a three second video. It's amazing. Okay, then watch this real quick. This is about three seconds.

Speaker 3:          01:32:38       Fucking truck. Camera Guy. Fucking nuts. Where was Jenny's ass? They were fucking screaming in the headphones. Why didn't you show Jenny's ass? You showed her face, you her walked down. She's very beautiful. If you had an opportunity to shore up, we need that for a Camaro. American needs that Phil Davis two rounds. He got clipped right though. Oh Damn. Clover knows it's [inaudible] took over is on fire right now, but he knows it's do or die, man. These two rounds in the whole damn big push. Big Push a Louis and sham. Well, he's built like a goddamn superhero is his back. His legs are retarded. They're just so goddamn big.

Speaker 3:          01:33:30       Go full screen on that shit. We're going to watch a fight look like, hold up. Positive, positive, positive, positive. We'll watch that shit after this fight that's happening. We'll need some downtime while there's we, I want to fucking kill an animal to someone to take their clothes off. Take that whole big takedown for Phil was the best light heavyweights in the world. A cue up that rush and beating the shit out of these two guys from 1982 that's fine. As long as he had those shiny pants on. I used to love the kickbox and pants that lace in the front like a sneaker. I remember that Shit. Chuck Norris. She used to wear them. I have those pitches. I had those. I love Chuck Norris so much. I wore those for my taekwondo pants. Oh look at this. Phil Davis gave it up. Oh look at that. I like how you hook the leg.

Speaker 3:          01:34:17       That was nice. That was very nice. Cradle baby. Phil Davis, 10th grade wrestling man. And my big brother used to do that to me. I hate it. But you remember how Bas Rutten used to tap guys with some fucking crazy cradle? He would, he would be in that bar chart. Press the bar. I still use. Yeah. It's not that I'm asking assisting gay headlock on one side and he hooks your leg and the other side and he fucking flexes and just separate the head from your body sharp machine. He's so God damn strong. But especially in his prime boss was so damn technique dash to make you shit yourself can make you shit yourself. Yeah. We almost, well almost saw wants in the UFC. I forget who was gone for it, but I almost forgot it existed. And then, uh, Joe, uh, Joe Silva actually reminded me that's that Bas Rutten thing.

Speaker 3:          01:35:08       I was like, that's right. Damn Phil Davis run in it. That's insane. Running it, man. Another dog. This is a big job. Big Punches man. Phil Davis looking as good as ever against a fucking legit killer. But yeah, best performance of, yeah. Well, you know what? He came off that rumble fight. He knew he had to take it to the next level. I, you know what? I'll be honest, I would like to see him going for the finish. He's trying man now. I mean submit, submit duties. Sylvie's beat the shit out of him. I mean, he's got two minutes ago and he's beating the shit out of Glover Bat. Did he mean he's hit him with 30 or 40? Done. Answered Shock. I'd still one handed the one harm. Comoros was him wanting the wonder bar. Very high level. What he's doing to Glover, man. I know he's making it look at these, but this is not, this is sick dude.

Speaker 3:          01:36:03       Glover's an animal animal straight. I wonder how much of an effect, if any, and I'm just throwing this out there because I have to look at that. He's on his camp to the camp in Danbury, Connecticut. Had as opposed to doing like American top team, you know, like what kind of sparring partners is it yet? And I don't know. I mean maybe he had a bunch of guys flying in tomorrow. This is an awesome wrestler though, I would imagine. Yeah, no, Phil is awesome. Oh there we go. Look, it's still going on. Glover could still catch them when one 20 to go. I wanted to finish. Right. Deep breaths hearing cause this going. Ooh. Ooh. Tude over the top. Oh, you heard him? He heard him with that one man that was clean on the jaw. Whoa. If he comes back now. So there you go man.

Speaker 3:          01:36:48       Nice dropdown. That single kicks chasing them new. He's just to stay on that dude. Yeah. And if he drags me to the ground and shit is all his, oh he came over, he recovered. He recovered. Look at that as his grappling. Cardio is different than striking cardio cause it's striking. Cardio's more labored. So when you see him standing up and he's tired, he's still like moving, kind of labored. But when you see him on the ground, he looks fucking sharp as shit. Even when he's tired, he's gassing all over the place and recovering all over the place. Gassing, recovering, but his wrestling, like he doesn't gas when he's grappling. I mean he's, he's breathing while he's doing it. I mean, you could tell he's taking some big ass deep breaths. His mouth is open, but he's fucking dominate. He can do this all night. They could go five rounds of this. He didn't do this. I mean, he's got a burn hot. You have to burn hot in order to where a guy out in the open, I mean he's got to wear himself out. So we're, we're getting a view of his cardio over putting his hand up. That's called an ass whooping. So what happened is that San Diego about swooping in

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       Brazil, that was pretty good. Now that was crazy. I'm strong, real concrete. Three rounds, three rounds, three rounds a day. Look like that after the first round. Remember? Yeah. That's a big victory right there. I'm just calling a big victory is huge because if he looks I fucking quit. Quit my MMA, Bro. I'm going straight to pro wrestling. Dan, what's up? Power bomb everyone. Big fucking loss mentality. You need to get to that point. I Phil Davis is that cap? Yeah. Tressler coming off it again. Damn. That was a nice move. That front kick right hand he does and he throws the right hand like a jab. His right leg is forward when he throws it, but he's got a lot of pop behind it. He catches you like it cracks you with it in the end he and you're gassing all over the place constantly and recovering constantly.

Speaker 2:          01:38:44       Right. That's just gas cook. If you went gassing all over the place, you ain't pushing yourself hard enough. Exactly. That's how you break people. Yeah. That's just, yeah. We just saw, we just saw a film, break him shit about cardio my whole life. I always heard people talk about cardio. Tito Ortiz, we talk about Cardio Radica too. They're talking about cardio and I always thought cardio was how long can you go before you get really tired, like your like huffing and puffing. That's your cardio. I've got like eight minutes of Cardio I got, that's what I always thought it was. No one really explained it to me at all. I never trained like a professional athlete until Metamorris. Yeah. And once I, once I, I decided this, of course he, of course you weren't. So I just decided what am I going to do for Cardio? I was, you know, I was lifting weights, I was doing a lot of Jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          01:39:30       I was training with John John and I just decided, fuck, I'm going to do sprints and I'm gonna go to the pool, the 24 hour fitness and I just, I'm going to figure this out by myself. I just drove to the fucking pool. They had a big clock and I just, I never did this. I'm not a professional. I go, I'm on a sprint 20 times across the pool. I've done sprints before in the past 20 times and as soon as the clock, the big clock in the pool hits the 12th that's when I'll take off and then I might finish at 25 or 30 and I'll stay at the other side of the pool until it hits 12 again. It hits 12 and go boom sprint again. I just made this up and I did it 20 times. The problem with doing cardio and the pools that you don't get to read your heart rate.

Speaker 2:          01:40:09       Do they have like a cardio monitor that works? This is what I did. I kept it simple. I just wouldn't fast as I fucking can and I didn't even know the coaching me because cause I, my law was I'm only going to arrest until it hits 12 again so I better bust ass. So I was racing across the pool so I can get that time to rest. And what I learned about myself is holy Shit. Every time I on a across I got really tight. The first three were easy, but when I got the 10 to 12 my plan was, I just said 20 cause metamorphosis, 20 minutes. I go, I'm going to do 20 and do that at 10 1112 I was dead just on the edge of the pool. Barely Gal was dying. There's all these old people at the pool and should they go, what the fuck is this guy doing?

Speaker 2:          01:40:50       I just made the shit up, but what I learned, I learned it. You could be dead tired and recover within 30 seconds. Yeah, that's what I was learning and I'll be dead when they hit the nine I'd be like, we're at the table, but when it, by the time we have to 11 I'd go, let's go again. Another sprint. The Ama, you get across, boom. I ended up with 30 seconds of rest. Same thing. So you learn that Holy Shit, you can recover over and over. If I didn't know this, when I'd get to that point in grappling, I would, I would go, I'm done. I would break. I go, I'm done. Understand I have to do more. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:41:28       Oh, someone needs to talk to them. They already know you're the champ taking the beaver effect. When he put that shit on, everyone goes, knowledge is great, man. Yeah, look good man. Let's show that karate video. Let's shut up karate video calling out Anderson's our full fill. Did he call it airs and sold on Anderson Silva? He did. That's what he said. Yeah. He goes, I'd be like resistance, but there's only one I want to fight next. That's a mind. God is fighting Nick Diaz. Why is he saying that now? He talks a lot. He's got a got a triple, not in that time. Think it's fat. He knows what he's talking about. It's watch this shit. So the dude's or karate, Duke in and out. Watch the raft once the rough. He's just a fucking each other up and try while they're gone off. Man, where is this taking place? Check this out. Where's this taking place? It's a gymnasium for sure, Dale.

Speaker 3:          01:42:31       Oh Shit. Took out that guy to fucking went like cop. No one. No one's stopping him either man. Genes at the circus where the animal just goes fucking crazy. So he tries to push and what they don't push away fake guy and look at this guy. He gets caught. This guy is tore to [inaudible] is tore up. That's insane. He fucking camera crew that will, they're filming today. That's why we're watching it. The competitors like what the, like this is someone's memory. That was a sketched. Maybe somebody was filming in the making of a movie. I don't know. Wow. That looked like a real fight, man. It was a movie that was a real fight. Those guys were really hitting each other. That was a good technique to, where'd that take place Jamie? Looking at? It doesn't necessarily say it looks Russia. Russia. Yeah. That looks like something would happen.

Speaker 3:          01:43:23       Have you seen that? The amateur boxing fight that the guy after the fight it takes you to off and goes over. Beats the shit out of the raft. It's bad. Yeah. I think and watch that. It's an old guy. It's fucked up and you see a chase the guy out and they get a fucking shit. Help the old man, but he's fallen over. It's like, oh fuck. Yeah. It wasn't funny. Now looking at the graphics on these Games, I know that looks good. That looks like a real dude. Look at this. By the way. It doesn't like that when you play, it

Speaker 1:          01:43:53       just doesn't, I mean it looks close, but this is the [inaudible] enough clipping and weirdness to it. The frames per second that they can achieve and these previews they do, they can just make it look a lot sweeter where a couple of years from indistinguishable from reality though probably on those games. Well you're going to be able to have games where you use the oculus rift and you play out like a video. You make a video of things that are actually happening and instead of a game engine, just have them do it like a hundred different fucking ways where you know, have them repeat the same scenarios over and over again from all these different angles so that no matter where you are, where you're moving, it feels like you're actually doing it. You know, you could turn to your left and the fucking, it's, it's really just like as if you turn to your left, like there'll be able to program those in the same way they do it with like stop motion animation where you have to do each individual frame.

Speaker 1:          01:44:41       They'll just have different possible scenarios that they have. People actually act out to the point where they cover the whole room, like a, like a fan, like one of those folding fans. Every ounce of the room gets covered with a possibility. And then you have these head headset on and you're in this room and you can take these possibilities. It's already been planned out as a video and then you watch it, you play it out and you fucking shoot aliens like in real time and you fuck and you Siri ships every everyday you get it going to happen. Man, that has that electro stem you down when you put electric stem on it, like causes collapse, you know? So if you get hit somewhere, it'll just cramp up. You know, they don't have it yet, but it's going to happen. Yeah. So that frees you up one side.

Speaker 1:          01:45:25       You have to like limp through. They have those things already. Those, those stem machines, people use them already. They supposed to help recovery. Yeah, the complex machine. Yeah. If you added that shit too, like a suit, something bites you, you feel it. Teeth clamp in your body. You could have a virtual lab on your pants. What's given us give up some predictions here. What do we think is going to hold Kot though? Mendez decision. Although when you say Aldo, like how quickly a first round, second round, third round, third round Mendez decisions has been says second round. Tko second round. Tko says for your poet he gives zero fucks. He's making calls. Yeah. Eddie Bravo. I'm going to say

Speaker 1:          01:46:14       dammit. Dammit. I don't know. I'm going with them and I don't know as well. Kareem Abdul, check them all. What do you think? I don't know man. It's a tough one. It's a tough one. Great Pink stolen. It's really fun. Yeah. This side of the table takes zero chance. Here's, here's my take on it. Aldo is fucking incredibly difficult to take down. Like one of the most difficult to take down until he gets tired. The problem is by the time you get him tired and you take him down, you are eating some of the fastest fucking leg kicks in the business. That combination, the Duchy, the left hook to body, and then the right leg kick. He throws that motherfucker as good as anybody that's ever walked the face of the planet. If it Mendez is throwing that against pads every day, that's part of looking at things.

Speaker 1:          01:46:59       It is. It is possible that Mendez can win this fight. Don't get me wrong, Mendez can knock out anyone on the fucking planet if he connects the way he knocked out Clegg Weda the way he knocked out Darren Elkins, if Mendez cracks you, he can fucking put it on you. It's the hardest hitter in this unbelievable athlete. Ridiculous Freak athlete hits hard to it's, it's a wild fight. I don't, I don't know what I say earlier that I have no idea. I have no idea. Mendez can win this fucking fight. Don't, don't get me wrong. No doubt about it and he can win by knockout. I think he could do that to anybody. The question is if you watch their first fight and you watch their second fight, how much has he improved and that's the only thing that we're going to find out tonight. We're going to find out how much he's improved and whether or not, although is in any way regressed, you know, whether or not his injuries, he's had a bunch of injuries.

Speaker 1:          01:47:47       He said like a nagging neck injury. He said all sorts of different things that have you know, fucked with him. He's had kidney stones that he's gotten that either are, it's weird who you talked to. It's either it's genetic or it's from weight cutting. There's a lot of, a lot of people that believe it's, it's an either or thing that you might be genetic and you get it get exacerbated by the way. Cutting huge. He's a big guy. He's a big guy and he struggles to make that one 45 and I think that's one of the reasons why he's been having a hard time in the later rounds. But God damn, to get through those fucking rounds, you've got to go through hell son. That beating he put on your ride favors leg. Holy Shit Dude. He's something. He something man, he's a lightning fast, ridiculous striker who was also world class at Jujitsu. His jujitsu game is fucking real good. You just don't see it. You know you, but occasionally you do see it like in the Mike Brown fight when he got brown on his back and he sunk those hooks in and that is a legit black belt back mount to smashing. You know, he's, where were you at that your I fight with him.

Speaker 3:          01:48:51       That was, I was out there. It was fucking, when all that came out to the, uh, I'm going to run this town tonight. Yeah. That was the only person in Sacramento going, Oh my God. Like, what are you doing? I'm like, he's going to fuck your boy up. Wait, ed sores told me about that before. He was so excited. His manager is like, he's got to come out to that Jay z song. I've run this town tonight. And we were like, Oh shit. He's going deep expressions in Sacramento. It needs to be a scamming combo. Gary Combo with the elite wrestler with Chuck Liddell striking like that was a nightmare. Like what the fuck are you going to do? You might get shut off, there's a good chance tonight you're going to get shut off. You know what I mean? But the Combo of black belt in Jujitsu and vicious striker, damn, that's a whole different dimension. It is, right is the ground game is a more dangerous ground. You're trying to get this guy to the ground, but he might choke you. There's a very good that he's better than

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       you on the ground. So what now? And it opens up. You're going to do now it opens up pos. Wrestlers in this day and age are not really just rustlers pretty much everybody has some ground game knowledge, but you'd be amazed at how many guys are fighting in the UFC that you know, they really don't work on certain positions. Like they never work on being on their back. Yeah, I, I've rolled with some people that are in the FCM like I'm fucking tiny and I just followed you up like, and it's you guys and I've been, I've been, everyone talks about my wrestling, but I'm not a world class wrestler. I'm just go to that main wrestling. I mean I do beat up kids in college and stuff, but I never accomplished anything. Yeah. But it's all, it's a shit. I've been doing Jujitsu for just as long.

Speaker 1:          01:50:31       I'm only a purple belt, but that's because my coaches, my coach and he won't, I don't wear a ever. Yeah. Well that's probably, Jeeva is very like, he's amazing. You know. And she did too. But you can put it on a Gig. That's how you, that's how you get your belts. Don't get a bravo started on the game please. I'm safety. It's got a comma where you came from. I know. I just love the fact that we were in a fucking hoists Gracie tee shirt after all the shit you guys have been talking to [inaudible] you haven't talked to any shit? No. I'll put some in. Somebody comes up, I'm like, I talk shit. In a funny way. Those meetings are shitting in the angry when he's really mad at he hates me. Get Mad at you man. And a funny one. You've been nothing but fucking praising of him from the jump man.

Speaker 1:          01:51:16       I mean we both said that if it wasn't for voice, we would have never been in any Jujitsu in the first place. He just needs to sit. He's also, he's a proud guy and just he needs to sit down and realize with, with uh, with Eddie and just get the two of them together. If they spoke for more than half an hour, hoist would realize like Eddie, he's never disrespectful. No, he would never realize he's beating. Your brother never realized that he needs an Iowaska trip more than anything. It's unfortunate because a lot of people were upset at him for this whole thing. I mean, I've read a lot of forum threads about people with like legit arguments, like the, I used to be a hero to them and then you hear him saying shit like this is like, this is just not what my hero would say. Like why are you saying that?

Speaker 1:          01:51:58       Even the MMA websites we're talking about that. I understand what he was saying about pot. I, I, you know, crazy way. I know this isn't a sound insane, but I appreciate it. Like he's, he's thinking about me. That's fucking nuts. That's crazy. I'm going to see saying my man. That's crazy. Yeah. It's the ultimate use legend. I think it's, I think it's pretty cool. It's flattering. I wouldn't even, I like it. I'm like [inaudible] he thought he would punch my nose if I looked at him and rubber guard. He would punch you in the nose. Moist with Beltour. Yeah. He signed with belts or he's going to do not as a fighter. He's going to be Alexa ambassador. You know, Scott Coker is a friend of uh, the UFC. He used to own strike force. I think it's going to be different relationship with Bella tour. And I think fuck yeah, it's, it's always good for the sport.

Speaker 1:          01:52:52       Look, they know what they're doing. You know, they know that they have a B level organization is not, there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with having a beat. They have some great fights, a lot of fun fights. But you know, they've got a manual Newton, the UFC has John Jones, John Manual. Newton is a very good fighter, but he's not John Jones. And you know, they had uh, they had fucking Hector Lombard who might be the mother fucker at one 70. He might be the motherfucker scare. Yay. He might pay every month to talk. Everybody's scared of that. Too Tiring with,

Speaker 3:          01:53:23       uh, really interesting. Thanks. Anyway,

Speaker 1:          01:53:26       I want to do it. I'm just going to take some time off. Thank the sober and you know who's scary than Woodley physically. Woodley's a fucking beast.

Speaker 3:          01:53:34       They're Lombard. Exactly. Can you take a scan? We take a sale. It looks like a centipede. He's got dudes a bigger scarier that like a buff dude in a real old old cartoon where that'd be just like a dude who just like really buff and it looks fake. His ass legs just don't talk about this as a tail piece on them. I thought it was brushing bodybuilding spray painted sweats on. I'll do. I was like the ass on that cows. He's just all judo the fuck out. Yeah. We haven't had asked for days. We did have some gay talk. Okay. We did. Okay, so we're all a little bit town. Just the tip. Remember we said that if we were okay with this place would be a mess. We'll be having an orgy. There wouldn't be no fight companion. We'd be under an orgy watching the fight to win. You'd pull your dick out and be like, what? Darren Elkins one right back be like loads. You got another one. Your neighbors when you look [inaudible] bro quit. He called Quinten. Is that but someone got called them out mountain. There's 10 minutes left. I got another one bro. Let time pass per, okay.

Speaker 3:          01:54:58       Let's hear what it sounds like when they introduced it. I can't go higher than you want to hear what it sounds like. You thought you said light cause you're a volume button on that. I want to hear this when they introduced, although that place is going to go fucking Shit House insane.

Speaker 1:          01:55:13       Give it a good crank Jamie cranked up bitch. Where the fuck up? Look at the size of that place. Jamie gold. Craig it up Jamie. I just love hearing the Brazilian fans scream. You ain't seen Aubrey's been there dude. It's like no other place in the world when it comes to the enthusiasm of the fans. It's

Speaker 3:          01:55:37       clearly the charts. Listen, listen, listen. Here is

Speaker 6:          01:55:48       so far. Sounds like fucking Stephan bottles. He never it from, he grew up on the outer side but Conor Mcgregor in Rio and then I fought in Dublin and Dublin was in Rio was amazing but Dublin was it fucking insane. They're just drunker. Oh they're drunk rather wild. Wild. At first I got the, and I was kind of like, fuck this kid Connor, like kind of annoying. And then as I'm sitting there watching him like psycho analyzing the whole thing and just kinda just watching it all unfold. Like this motherfucker is crazy and everywhere you go in Ireland they're like, oh you're already here for Connor.

Speaker 6:          01:56:34       Yeah, I guess so, right? I guess that's why I'm here. Here we go. Mendez moving forward and as they kicked me this Mendez, he did his face right away. Boy. Dwayne movement there. Look at this. Nevermind. He does look like Tj. I lied again to good, good shots. Totally dude. Aldo demendez looking at, Ooh, I live in all. Look, it's ghetto like that kicked by Mendez right there though. Oh, you still might not go to the snow. This is going to, someone's going to sleep I think. Oh check that one. So that one coming to come after. Good Jab, right hand by Mendez. The more it can make all the work, like this man man has got a little bit of a mouse in that left eye. A little bit of a mouse. And if men he's rocked. That was a big that. Who? Who's wobbly son.

Speaker 6:          01:57:38       Left Hook uppercut. Holy Shit going south pawn. I'm occasionally fearless. Good. Jen Mendez looking to get this fucking title man. Are you kidding me? This is fucking exciting. Fuck yeah, it is. Ooze on looking at uncork right there in that right hand. Oh, I'll throw lands one. You don't want to let with creating monsters. Seriously. Well we kept but look now Mendez is right in front of him. He doesn't want to do this guy days until it got you there. Got To get on your bike, man. Yeah. Well you know what? You get that feeling like you might finish this fucking guy and you're standing right in front of her. No catches people. That's how although catches people, you don't want to be standing in front of them. You want to go right back to what got you to that spot. I mean he's definitely recovered by now.

Speaker 6:          01:58:29       You've got to assume he's recovering the fly flying near right, but he hasn't been recovered. Maybe it doesn't look the same hard. Maybe Mendez knows he heard him like right there and I didn't look like it was like boom, body shot. Nice. Oh like kick. He's going to go high with it. Eight eight 11 looks like it hurt him a little bit. I left her son. Good defense by Mendez to although so goddamn sudden he could just end shit and everything he throws is perfect. Perfect technique, Mendez just standing right in front of all the, who the fuck would have thought this vicious left dude. Nice Jab by Mendez. How much better to his fucking striking get wait mode when fucking Ludwig is a wizard. He really is a goddamn wizard. A crazy OCD wizard.

Speaker 5:          01:59:28       Nice left hook. God Damn. Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

Speaker 6:          01:59:38       Damn. He was like, no more knees. Please kick. Oh, chow on the dude. All those lit up. Look at his face. Oh, I'm chuck over the top again. It's awesome.

Speaker 5:          01:59:58       Oh

Speaker 6:          01:59:58       Shit. One 37 to go. Damn. Holy Shit. What a fucking fight. That's it in the crowd. Now just miss with that advocate. They're screaming at you. Oh, you can't just heat that kick. He just ate that one thing. The crowds ate a jab right there too. I bloke. Come on, man. They worked it out. Don't give them a chance again. Back to the foot work son. Yeah, he's got it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I hope Duane Ludwig screaming that out. I'm right now trying to stay on him, but you know, although deserves his fucking rest. If it's a legit, I poke. Let's take a look at it right here. Yeah. Kinda hit his eyebrows in Aurora, Colorado. That's not an iPod. Okay. So let's look the, the consensus, he's probably taking a little bit of a break right here, right? 100% veteran move 500% right? Yep. And there's nothing wrong with that, right? This isn't his first Rodeo. Yeah. And it look, it legitimately did go in his eyes, so he's taken a little bit of a break. Maybe it hurts more than me. He's like, yeah. And he's allowed to say if he's allowed to. It's not really cheating. Did I get poked in eye? Yeah. He's probably not even say anything. Huh? It went my eye. Are you okay? When my eye. Ooh, right back at it.

Speaker 5:          02:01:15       Oh my hand. Oh, I love her clip. Let's take some down. Look at this. Scramble matches keep down. Lot of times we'll have shit finish and finish him. Oh Man. You got to finish.

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       Got to get that knee across.

Speaker 5:          02:01:44       Oh,

Speaker 6:          02:01:51       18 seconds to go. I've got no heart attack. Or they say Mendez work. Oh my God. For some awesome.

Speaker 5:          02:02:07       Oh good.

Speaker 6:          02:02:17       Holy Shit. Covered. He'll recover. What a fucking round. I mean things like a movie coming out of this bucket. Two gyms together just turn into amazing. Oh my God. What a fucking round Bueno says. Oh look at the end of the fight, boom at the buzzer. He relaxed. Just beat, beaten up the first and the minute you see the girl in the background shaking her finger. How has that made you? Let me know. She's going to get on a, on Twitter. I've got fired. Watch has got to be mended. His girlfriend. Yeah. No Brazilian check's going to be wagging her finger or if she is she saying you showed her message shit. He recovered. He's fine. Yeah, you said it fine. You crazy, dude. That guy's a fucking the fine. Fine, fine. He might be concocted outside birdies. Dude, look at him right now. It's not the only one.

Speaker 6:          02:03:21       No knows right now. Right now it's Chad. That's it. He's the only one who knows. Look at is, I know he's glazed over. Even if, yeah. Even if he does recover well, that was a stunning patch of the footwork. I sometime I look at him dancing around like an angel dude, like a tiny little Buffy angel. He took a bunch a bunch of fucking punches off of his clock right there. It looks beautiful. Look at that. If he gets, if he gets hit again, he's going to be for sure his Chin's going to be diminished by that. Are you crazy? Look at that as a slip and slip. No rock though. Eddie Bravo's given up on doing commentary.

Speaker 6:          02:04:02       Chad just looks better. He's not moving on that left everyone at every level. He's buying time with his footwork. Oh. Oh No. He could hear that. He was trying to hit it with a knee. He was trying to catch the jab. There we go. Yeah. This one does. Yeah. Unless the fight ends here. No, weird shit's happened before. Let's take a look at it. Oh, split wrong. Strong foot tables. Okay. Now Ian, if he's got a metal cup on, how much difference is it for the front, the deck and the ball's bees and for beans, frank? Yes, it's fine, but it's the undercarriage. The called the table shots still hurts. That hurts. That one sucks. I wasn't. Yeah, in the teen area and then underneath you still go up into your junk and it hurts. I got kicked in the Dick the other day. I align brews down half my deck.

Speaker 6:          02:04:56       And what circles is that conversation come up? I got kicked in the Dick. I called her. I'm like, well you got something to tell me. Like I got hit in the Dick one so bad. I just went and started wearing a cup for Jujitsu cause my Dick, I took my jacket off and it was filled with blood. Oh yeah. And so I was thinking, God damn it, do I go to the emergency room and then I decided what would I do? That was my nose. I like it was my nose. I wouldn't go anywhere. So I just went home and I jerked off cause I w I figured dash got hard. I didn't have to worry and it was okay. It's weird how we're on the seafront. I piss blood for a few days though. Oh, it was just a guard pass to somebody was passing my garden. He shoved his knee right into my dick hole. So as a girl I get nervous about that. I just wish y'all would wear cubs all the time. I made kids after that though, so it's all good. Back to this fucking awesome fight. Shit. Oh there's a hard one. That was a hard one. And he shook. What did he shake his finger because he checked. Checked it. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          02:06:07       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:06:07       Tell us. Well this is the thing about Aldo. Everybody knows that in the second, third and fourth round he starts to slowly begins to taper off and oftentimes in the fifth round is just not the same fighter for the first couple of rounds. He's a motherfucker. Ooh, that rocked him. But there was, this was a crazy first round and here we are in the size of body care. If Mendez might be start wold, I wasn't going, man, this might start to think that he's, uh, he's getting into him.

Speaker 6:          02:06:37       But you know what? Men Is, has not been known for his cardio either because he's such a Beasley dude. You know those Beasley guys, the lombards and the Woodley's and there's so much muscle involved, so much fast twitch too. It's not that slow. Endurance runner. Nick Diaz type muscle. Yeah. That guy. You never see him tired. This is a fucking great fight though, Huh? Cause this is where it gets weird. It gets weird if you can get into the third, fourth and fifth round, especially if Mendez starts getting loose. Who won the first round? For sure. Share fucking crazy round. But I've got to say, although, although had them almost, how cold? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got a job twice instead of one. Yeah. The last one was giant. The last one was just Jen. Oh, nice body kick. Oh Shit. Mendez getting loose. Oh Shit.

Speaker 6:          02:07:28       Oh ooh. Check. We owie Owie owie right hand over the top to the body by all them. Wow. All the loves that left Hook. He's got a fucking nasty whipping one too. No matter how much adrenaline you have, when you get, when you check a leg kick like that shit in the shit, it's still hurts, right? Oh, the fight. Well, unless you're on one of those tie dudes like Malheur pet that just see ever seen Malpais fight where it kicks guys shit in the Shin on purpose to break them down. We just had Yeltsin client or at our gym, God, 145 pounds kicking a bag. Like, oh my God. He's a ferocious guy, man. One of my shitty partners just beat Mallee pet reeling. Shane Blonsky fighting boy shit dude. Yachts and Clive fought in Lyon fights recently. Holy Shit. Is he good? He thought whether that Indian guy, yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:08:23       I love watching pure tie like those short typewriters like him. Like mammopad Yeltsin cries the mother fucker though, man. He's got like, he's 30 years old, right? And he has like some ungodly my fights. Some that's so crazy. Him Sand shy, super bond guys like that. Yeah, because then when they all come over they come and stay with him and like hang out in my coach. Oh do they really amazing rules. The most hardcore they allow them. Yeah. Well they allow you to clinch up and throw each other on the ground as it pretty much on the, on the ground. You could throw him and shit. He had left foot drop on. How does that bedrock old fights. Yeah. Draco they used to, they used to have [inaudible] Draka these to have a takedowns. Most Smith fought and that shit is that those Ho taste them again at the end of the week since sweeps and like kind of, it's the most hardcore Mendez.

Speaker 6:          02:09:10       Strike it. I'm thinking about the taking the time I oh, drag him into the hole. Punch and kick it still be more hardcore. Yeah, I think so. I think it should be more Tyrell's. Yeah. I like my lion fights better rules. They'll allow more tide. They clinch up, they hold onto each other for awhile. They ragdoll each other and needed a body elbow over the top. They don't even have elbows and glory. Glory is all kickboxing, like Dutch style. And we have some amazing Americans right now. Yeah, I mean you got Kevin Ross, Joe Schilling, Romeo, Don's a chi and back like, and these are all guys that are up, you know friends with. It's, it's to watch him fight as fuck. How bout shillings fucking fight in golden glory again. So what does his name Marcus, oh my God. And then he fought. So that was an extra rather fight fight.

Speaker 6:          02:10:01       Another fight. Three rounds. And then he went and fought in the finals and fought in Fatuma decision. Incredible. With arm and arm to quit fucking bad ass mother fucker. He's so talented. You see that spinning and spinning backhand that he hit him with the slip. I just loved the way he fights too with his hands down. It was like a snake. Ooh, Mendez coming at him. Now this is the round. You pick it up. Yeah. This is the, look at this. He's already, he's got to show the, she you. That's the game. It's a soup now. Things are looking way better for Mendez. You digging into the third, fourth and fifth rounds? Traditionally you're dealing with a different Aldo. Oh No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's the anywhere where we are a sad group of fucking non fuck AA or gee haven't dude.

Speaker 6:          02:10:50       Have you had someone cut their, your, your eye with their finger of your budget. Cut your eye before. No, but you've Winkeljohn story, right? Yeah. My Shoe, the great trainer from Jackson's academy went blind because the guy, he was holding pads for his toenail went into his eyeball slices eyeball but it was like Ooh. Oozing out into his hands. Like fell out. Yeah. Oh Man. So it's like a bad one. You ever ever hear of Sean Sean bias, Sean bias, crazy fucking fighter from nor cal. We were wrestling season tickets back and he would just grab my head and skipped his finger up my eyeball. I was bleeding. That was one of the scariest moments ever. But also it hurts so bad. Okay, here we go. They're back. They're back. Cause he going to take a point away. No, I said next time. Next time. Just take a point.

Speaker 6:          02:11:40       Let's see. Mendez, good defense. Oh, tagged them. He tagged him tagging with that left. Whoa. What the left. Oh, right hand of all those. So Dan is such a sweet right hand. That's the one he heard him with the end of the first router. Yeah, Dude. Although still here man. Great, great endurance. And the shark, I wish men does get through his wrestle a little bit. Yeah, they show it to him like can you make them work? But I think he's worried that if he makes them work like that, then he'll be too tired to do what he needs to do to stay safe on his feet. Right. He burned a lot of energy earlier and that he knows, but he wants to definitely be able to have the speed and movement. This is the, the Duane Ludwig style strategy stuff. You know what's most interesting about this Duane Ludwig approach?

Speaker 6:          02:12:30       He didn't use it. No toilet. Straight floor drains the first guy to slow it straight. Dwayne had nasty counters. No this and no fucking no slop in any of his movement. Yeah. Like when he knocked out Jonathan Goulay with that right hand. That's shit. He's backing up and that right hand comes off like a piston. That's how great Dwayne is. If he knows oh shit. Oh Shit. He knows that uh, the best possible style will be stuff that he doesn't, isn't, oh, hard ice chat tude although fucked him up with that Jab. Nice inside. Like Carlos Mendez is trying to win this fucking fight he got when he gets hit, he's getting angry and he's like digging his heels in and say no, not tonight, not tonight. And she's a couple of times been tagged and then come back and rocked all though because he's just determined to win this fight. Straight title. But man, that's where you gotta be careful when you're moving towards Aldo. Those counters come so sharp. Who Do you thinks winning so far? That's a good question. I think all those up, all those, yeah, I'll definitely when the first, I think in the second round I would say it's close, but probably all though, right? I would have to go over that again. Oh, that was definitely sure. Yeah. She knows it all. I don't know about for sure. What about this 100% although he's hurt. Wow. He's, he's, he's throwing the cut.

Speaker 6:          02:14:16       He got hurt back and forth. Oh, that Meagan. They heard each other. Oh, he is fucking tired. But he's still dangerous as shit. It throws so hard. Oh God. Damn Dude. Good sprawl by Aldo too, huh? And now man is head shots. Just trying to recover her. I keep punching him. What did, I don't know why you're fucking stolen out. Doesn't want him to complete that single right. Oh, lefthand. Oh, he's bad son. Look at this. Wow. Mendez is in the cruise. Shit. Foot stops looking at, he's going, Marco, who? I wonder why more people don't do that. Does that hurt Brendan? I, yeah, don't do it to me and I want to do it.

Speaker 6:          02:15:17       It's kind of like, damn man, come on. It's the split stop. And then the front knee kick is horrible, but he's not putting much into these needs. Right. Because he doesn't want to commit. Oh, those are hard house. I love those who he's getting missing. Oh, that's a hard one, man. It's okay. You're going to break my boat there, right in front of each other and pinky talking and talking shit talking. Oh Shit. I wonder what he said. Oh yeah, they're laughing at each other. Oh, that dropdown now plumbed the plum baby. Look out for that. Nice. I said fight of the night. Oh, he tagged him with that left Hook.

Speaker 6:          02:16:00       Wow. Ooh. I'll go back and forth around the Mendez because of that. And then the, because of the end and the end, the fact that he got that takedown got ahold of them, but 10 although did crack him right there, but Mendez recovered. Is that all of a fight is a hell of a fight, man. It's close like that. Ron was close. Forgot about huge, although dropping him there, it's close. But I think Mendez was controlling the end of the fight and tag them at the end of the fight. I give a lot of credit to the end of a round or not the end of the fight. The end of a round. I'll give a lot of credit to the end of the round. I give a lot of credit to the end of a fight because I feel like, and this is a stupid way to look at it, but in a street fight, it doesn't matter if it got kicked your ass, if the teachers pulled you off of him, you won.

Speaker 6:          02:16:50       You know what I'm saying? A guy can hit you with like a one two punch kick you in the leg, punch you in the liver, you're getting fucked up, and then somehow know that he slips and you want up on top and you punched him in the face and the teacher pulls you off. Most people are gonna think you want, right? Yeah. Who was on top of the end? Oh, Danny was on top, Bro. He was going to kill that kid. You fluctuate their guard. Yeah. Sometimes Pete. Well that's a different one. It depends on who's watching the fight. Yeah. Damn all it looks big. I put a lot of muscle on Disney. I was about to say it looks skinnier than usual. I thought he looked real muscular. All right, here we go. Dig Deep. My friend Goldie, the homeless had an aneurysm right there. He switching up a lot, man. A lot of a southpaw movement. That's again, Dwayne, Dwayne, Aka Dominick Cruz.

Speaker 6:          02:17:42       Fourth Round is deep water for all though. This is where shit gets weird with him. Super Bad. I swear mark than ever to mark harmonic was on top of all of those. I'll never forget that. And Mark Hall make a very good striker. That was the fifth round, right? Yeah. Very good. Well, yeah, a mouse living in his house. I didn't know. Mike's been a hard iced tea. It's like someone's store, a can of pineapples and his forehead. Oh, Mendez is still sharp though, Dude. Mendez still sharp. He's in good shape for this fight. That's a fact, man. Good head movement to still switching up a lot, man. And he's not backing off his pace either. They're both. These guys are like not committing though. They're getting real close with their, they're touching, touching. They're looking for that fucking burst.

Speaker 7:          02:18:38       Favorite.

Speaker 6:          02:18:40       Right hand over the top. I Mendez almost mint. Maybe it wouldn't. Again, leg kicks off, shade way down, although just shook his head. They're talking and he's mad because that's sweet. Upper cut. Oh, he's fucking him up, man. He fucked him up at that left hand too.

Speaker 6:          02:18:59       What was the last time we saw all those face busted up like this? This is unusual. Barely missed that. Holy Shit. Dillashaw style. Fifth Round head kick. K. Oh well listen man, he's putting a pace on, although in this fourth round and although his coasting, he's not doing anything and this is where all those usually been in control. He caught him with that left hand over the top. What is he doing? He's complaining that the heads are, oh, he can't complain. That's a weakness. He knows he's getting fucked up. You can't, can't complain over Shit like that. You know what's going on, man? All the look and the wrestling, all I was going to get ghetto.

Speaker 6:          02:19:39       He just starts throwing fucking wild heat. You know what? What he's throwing is not hitting. He's getting them on the end. This shit. It's not having the same impact and Mendez has had in this round. I mean, look at the faces, although is broken up, man. Mendez is doing some fucking damage. Oh, guns. When you see your opponent has blood, yes, it does. It bleeds. We can kill it. It's fine. It's so fucking good. We'll move movies. A Predator. Predator, Bro. I don't sports a nigger. He just did a swap. Synagogues all equipment. The right at the very end of the punch though. Look at all those faces. Fucking bloody. Oh God. He throws, I think. Wow. Yeah. Oh, he got poked.

Speaker 6:          02:20:30       He got poked, man. Okay. He's just going to go right back in. I was out there. I see it. He's got better. Oh, back to the leg kick. What if he gets leg kicked it down? That would be hilarious. That would be hilarious. But then it's too late for that. Then you've got to do some real groundwork and those fucking first few rounds. Or are you just go out and Edson Barboza. I'm here. Edson Barboza he hit, might have one of the nastiest leg kicks in all of the UFC right now. For sure. Oh, by far. Nasty. He's one of the only guys who stopped to people by led cakes.

Speaker 6:          02:21:05       He stopped a Hefei Alo Olivera and he stopped, uh, one of his earlier opponents. Oh Man. Hard right hand by Mendez. U of c seven. Yeah, man. He was the one who showed everybody. What's up Paul Varland son chopped down the polar bear. Remember that shit? Oh yeah. 17 Marco, who was the king of the foot stomps to Paul violence. Hit me up on Facebook. Weird message. No Shit. Weird message. What's up bro? Yeah, we had met. That was a hard check. Heart check there. He setting up something. Javin that chest trap fighting to him. I don't want to hear about that weird message from a 359 dude lives in Alaska. Oh, this round. Just buy shit like that. He's so fucking athletic. It's crazy. Although, although, yeah, it's so violent and awesome. Oh, much at FIS. 10 seconds. Go the right hand over the top. I'm Chad.

Speaker 6:          02:22:14       They must be yelling at him to turn it up here. I wonder if he can hear Wayne and his fucking crowd. I got it to two. I think it's, I think it's a, I think it's too too as well. You think it's three Ronaldo? Three one Aldo. Oh look at that upper cut shit son. So you think all the one this round, how did it all the last round Chad one. This one I know about the land. The last one was kinda close but I think the last one she had definitely one. This one. I think the last one they're going to give it to all though cause he rocked him. And you said the end of the round. I think all those going to win that round in Brazil. But the end of the round was Mendez winning the round hit him. I mean I dunno.

Speaker 6:          02:22:54       I Dunno either which Strunk talking shit. That's so folks at homes that a fucking like you like, Ooh, well good. I could do commentary. Guess what? You could at least have exactly like you watching. This is fucking Ian Mccall, one of the best flyways on the planet earth spinning through space and he does commentary just like you. I don't fucking know what, we're not that cool. We're not that smart. This, there was a couple times, this is on air. You know there's a couple of times I'm also sober though. Oh Man, look at all those eyeball, Bro. Holy Shit. There's a lot of limited visibility. This is the fifth and final motherfucker wins this round ones. The fights might be APP. I swing in Brazil to see some crazy shit, man. Some crazy shit. You Jazz. You know Chad's going to bring it. I'll just got to turn this shit up.

Speaker 6:          02:23:46       Oh, Mendez would've left hand switches up to sell hard left. Fuck God damn. Woo. We got any punch final fuck numbers, dude. I don't want numbers. Oh, love her sneaky left hook as a writer out of the guard. Yeah, he whips it. You know he whips it to the body as well. They like each other, man. They're having fun now. It's a lot of respect now after this fucking crazy war. I mean these dudes know each other like nobody knows each other. Take Down, take, take it down and he's fucking tired too, man. This is going to be hard to shift to get back up from here. He does get back up. He's exhausted. Now you strike someone. Mendez is go Roulo strong at one 45 that dude is a beast. Who the crowd bill. This is the, if he wins, dude, this is the last Brazilian to hold the title.

Speaker 6:          02:24:42       Yeah. Every fucking champion will be American if he wins. So she does she show? Say they should know better. Don't be a terrorist. Everyone chant USA Corvette Corvette's should just send them all cars. Just that'd be say American as fuck, but it's the dry run. The core of Epi again, she chaired Hellcat. How do you like it? It's dope. I love it. So doe love it. 707 horsepower. Fucking Chrysler [inaudible] drove it when I was in Denver. She drove for the whole weekend. They gave me one of those. I might, I might get one of the only like let's, I just want to get an American muscle car, but I'm thinking about in 1969 Mustang. Yes. Nothing's been in your, nothing's going to be better to drive. It's not going to handle the same, but it'd different. Oh Shit. Yeah. They'll know. Pushes him off. That was my brother's first cause of 69 Mustang. It's a great car. So pretty aesthetics. The way it looks is a, you're onto something with corvette. They take all the, the UFC champions put commercials together and American as, fuck. That's a commercial. Oh Shit. Just go dude. Although connected here, man, this isn't good. This is not good at all.

Speaker 6:          02:25:50       Let's see that associate. So what about that, you know, finished them here. What if he uses was usually so we could stick on him to finish here and my friend was to planning time two 42 40 and he's used to having your eye are crawling around on him taking the bat. That's true. And up up again, get out since that's the thing about those guys, they all have fucking wicked guillotine defense. Oh, kick knockout are still in front of each other. Different 75 each other. Anything can happen in this kind of fight and that's why I just stepped back. Stepped off. Oh yeah. Step off again. Keep moving. Keep moving. Light on the toes of really thrown that money. Leg. Resting an hour, one hour, he says over, you did a lot of training. Oh vicious over the top. And left to the body first. Oh Shit. Oh my goodness.

Speaker 6:          02:26:41       Oh Shit. Oh, fucking Pez dispenser. Jesus. Oh Shit. Buckle up. That's so sad though with that left. Right. Again, although being very conservative with the kicks to men, very conservative with the kicks. Oh my God. Who the fuck is going to win this fight? This is this 90 seconds might be, here's the fight. I just looked up at the clock. This might be left hand, but he was moving away from that. He was sliding to his left. This law. Ah, fuck again with the knee. No, no, no, no. It's incidental. Oh my God. What time? He can't. He can't be taking any breaks here. They're going to give it to all though. They might not. Amen. This is a goddamn close round. Anybody they give it to all the high agrees. 50 seconds. Anybody could win this round. Anybody wins this round with one successful friends right now. Been a big hit. Yeah, I mean, but, but nothing stunning. If all know, stunned him here with something and had them wobbly. He did when he did. It just happened. But not like before. You know what I'm saying? Much cause he stunned Aldo too. He snapped his fucking head back with that jab and he's looking at that upper kind. I loved that. And Saba shit. 20 seconds, man. 20 seconds. Oh body kick. Come on.

Speaker 6:          02:28:23       Breaking out. 1515 oh check it. You're fucking crazy. You think the Brazilian judge was going to give us the Oh, right here by all go. Go, go, go. The exchange. Right hands. Oh Jesus Christ. I sweet. Oh Man. I don't know. I do not know you give it to all still around then more of these probiotic things out there that does a bunch in the back because you're fucking delicious. They're really good. They're really good. I love it. God Damn valuable fight. Oh my God. What do we think here? Although I think all of those goals, everybody thinks all though one.

Speaker 6:          02:29:07       I think if I had to give anybody the last round, I'd probably be Aldo. Yeah. You know what? I think men does this. When he snapped his head back, that was one of the most significant show going to give it to all dumb. It was close enough where they were like, you know what, I'm just going to give it to them. I would like to see the numbers, you know, cause we're watching it and having fun. That took, that was early. That was the first round. We get the numbers. It's all though all day. If you look at the number, but she looks up damaged. Yeah, that's true. Right? You significant strikes. It's going to be all to all day. Oh look at that right here. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. He walked back more seconds. I could have been a finisher left hook to the body.

Speaker 6:          02:29:44       So fish and replies, you know how powerful the replies are for the judges. They're looking at the replay. That's looks like three rounds to all though. Right? Faster. The crowd sways judging Mendez. Oh Jesus. Critics at the replays and go, if that's what they're showing, they thought, okay, but let's look at this. Look at the mean that that is a big goddamn round. So that was around three. So round three was definitely Mendez, right? That was the one he really heard them. That was the clearest round for Mendez round around three rather around four. It was like, who the fuck knows? So round three was definitely Mendez Brown Ford was, who the fuck knows? And round five. You know Ralph, I was so close. Who fucking knows man? Who the fuck knows? Great fight though. So you guys think all Dubai decision, their bias, right? Whoever won, whoever won what a fucking fight. Yeah. Jesus Christ was amazing. Amazing. Wow. Unbelievable.

Speaker 7:          02:30:48       What a fight.

Speaker 6:          02:30:51       You know how much shit Conor McGregor is going to talk after this fight. I don't think he wants any idea what some of this you got picked up by a midget. Imagine what I'll do. Tiaa split decision. Hold on. I imagine what I'll do to you. I'll do, what did he say? He's out. He'll knock his head clean off. I'll knock his head clean off all the way back to Dublin.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       Ananymous decision. Yeah. They're very happy in Brazil. Very, very, very, very good fight. Great by fun. Wild fight. You know, that's like everything you want to fight. Two elite fighters going at it. Uh, changing direction, changing the tide back and forth. Both guys get tested. Both guys have to overcome fucking amazing fight.

Speaker 1:          02:31:46       Powerful, big, handsome Brian Dan with a napkin coming out of his pocket. They tried to get me that shit. I'm like, put that God damn Napkin. It's not going in my fucking pocket. You haven't where it sits though? Yeah. I don't wear the jacket though. I gave up on the jacket. They used to make me aware of the jacket. They got me all these beautiful suits. They had them custom made from my bridge. Troll body. They fit great. You always have to wear long sleeve shirts. No, I just do. I don't know. It's just, I don't want to be distracting, so I don't want to show tattoos. That's why I wear long sleeved. Mostly on stage too. It's just distracting. It's one more thing for people to think about. Damn. What's he saying? He's all caught up to look at it and left eye. Holy Shit. I go, no.

Speaker 7:          02:32:39       Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:32:40       Well, Hey folks, uh, what a fucking fight. What an awesome card. So a powerful, Phil Davis does a big victory for Phil Davis. Yeah, I was huge. He looked like a monster. That was like the best Phil Davis of all time. Especially after that last performance with that. Yeah. Fucking amazing. Returning really throwing leg kick fan, although did not throw that many. I mean he got lit up, but some of his own, I mean of a Mendez is right off the back. But this was a fucking test man and he survived a really motivated, really well trained Chad Mendez. But what a fucking close fight. What a great fight

Speaker 1:          02:33:24       it just stained division, man. I don't even know how he can say he thinks he deserved to win, you know? I mean he won. You know what, why I say I think I deserve to win your you fucking one man. It wasn't based, I guess so. I mean, it was a close fight, but Connor, everybody in this room thinks that he wants. Right. But isn't that kind of a common thing when someone walks away? Way more damage than the other. Yeah, sure. But you know that damage can come from one exchange, right? Yeah. Like, um, Chris, Jerry, when he beat that, uh, that provide Niqab Guy, he got lit up in the first round closed. I almost completely shut and then outboxed him for the remainder of the fight. You sit in a tremendous, tremendous job. And some people have more scar tissue. Some people take damage along. Worse than now. There's from Leiter's strikes.

Speaker 1:          02:34:15       José although mother fucker right there, that's the motherfucker. What do you guys think in the pound for pound thing? Like he used to get tossed around as being as possible. Do you still think he is after this fight? Number one pump them. Really? Yeah. No, that's what you think Joe. No, no. I think it's probably mighty mouse. I really do. I mean, I think mighty mouse, yes. She's better than mighty mouse. He hit my car might be better than mine if you beat him. I really think that you probably deserve pound for pound best. I just think that if I look at technique for technique, okay. And I look at what he's been able to pull off in title fights, he's like flawless. You know, I think there's other guys fighting tougher guys. He might be right. And there's, that's the, that's the thing about like 2005 and that's why Jones comes into Jones.

Speaker 1:          02:35:00       Jon Jones, Jon Jones, he is maybe it real quick. You put all those guys in the room and came back and twist everyone's heads off and don't even don't, I hate when people put Rhonda in their pound for pound. God will put Ron's house category. It's hard to do it with a woman. I don't agree with that at all. I think pound for pound, she's number one of all time. And then how about women ever to walk the face of the planet? She's number one on the list. There should be anyone else is probably some crazy Mongol bitch though from like 1220 pound for pound bales there a few males and females. That shit ain't fair. Ronda Rousey's the ultimate chick ever. And I agree that puts her on that power. The pound for pound means that weight doesn't matter. You know what I mean? But I but male put Ronda Rousey in there with Hanan. Barao he was so crazy. Do you have any idea what TJ would do to her? It's silly, man.

Speaker 1:          02:36:01       And so this is about, but we're talking to and morale would beat. We're talking around about pound for pound. They're the same weight. Yeah. Do you see that fight would be, there would be a ruthless wife beating, which would be horrible if you go pound for pound. Are you talking about the toughest man in the world? It's usually the heavyweight champ, which Jon Jones, I rolled with Rhonda La. Oh No, no, no man. They had to roll together. It's a different scenario, but they don't, they have to MMA fight and when you're talking about kickboxing Hanan Barao can do shit you can't do, it's not going to go, but look, he's a man. He's a strong man and he can fucking kick ridiculously hard. He can punch ridiculously hard. He can hit you with a standing knee like a front kick. He can see you in the face.

Speaker 1:          02:36:53       She might or she might wake up with a flashlight in her face. Be Stupid to include women. And she says that by on, Rhonda says that, by the way. I know they asked her and she's like a woman fighting a man. It's ridiculous. It's just stupid and it is stupid. It's solely no hanky. Brian Stann Hanky Goldie wins goes. No, no, I see. I give Brian Stann the wind cause Goldie has that three piece suit on. I hate the three. Which one has more makeup? That's the real question. Go. Sure. Goldie. Oh the three pieces. She needs a nap in a drink of water guys. Conor McGregor is next while now ever, right? Yeah. If he beats Dennis Seaver and Dennis Seavers. No fucking pushover tennis sneakers. Got that sneaky front. Like roundhouse kick. Good match for beats frank. Yeah, it's shorter. It competes. Look, if cub beats Frankie by substantial margin or Frankie beats cub by substantial margin, like whether by decision submission or knock out, they probably, in my opinion are ahead on the ladder.

Speaker 1:          02:37:55       Dylan profitable. Miss Connor puts ass is in seats. That's why you saw his fucking picture and he's hanging out with Dana white down there in Brazil and a lot of people like that. Here we go, Swanson and Edgar. This is my opinion. This is the real number one, number two title fight and a contender fight, but it doesn't mean that I don't think that McGregor is up there with them. I think he definitely is. But here we're looking at a guy like cub Swanson. It has a fucking litany of broken bodies in the UFC to his career. I mean, he's looking at what he did to Dennis Seaver. If Connor Beats Dennis Seaver. Okay, that's great. That's a good fight. Look up what cup did to Dennis Seaver cub lit Denisey were on fire come most [inaudible]. I know. He's fantastic. Frankie Edgar's a motherfucker and he never stops moving. He cuts crazy angles. He's got ridiculous wrestling. He's got more heart than any fucking human being that's ever walked the face of the planet. He workcover's covers better from a beating than anyone I've ever seen in my life. It's not about that though, is it's not about Connor's entertaining. People on seem fight. So then he just had the title shot. But how about this in New Jersey, Frankie Edgar versus Conor Mcgregor for the number one to 10 that's slam dunk.

Speaker 1:          02:39:09       That shit. Do that Shit in New Jersey or even better. You do it in Dublin, you know, fucking soccer stadium dub. They didn't even have to fight for the title. You know what you do? This is what you do, man. You'd go to Josie. Aldo don't go. Uh, I heard you hurt your foot. Fucking thousands. Can you just say, Hey, listen, my film, we're talking about an interim title. We're not talking about the real title is peeling off cash. Can Juliana white should fucking shit everybody throw your cell phone in the bucket and we'll go into this room and shut that door. Joey Diaz doing Conor McGregor was a cock sucker. I'm the number one contender. I put asses in seats. I'm the guy. Nobody wants to see you fucking faggy. So cal Caltech tools. Oh, I like palm trees. Get the fuck Outta here. I'm from Dublin motherfucking island. Okay, you're from California. He's sitting in the fucking Hov Lane. And Electric car got stuck on a horse on a horse. It's raining out all day and I'm drunk.

Speaker 1:          02:40:15       I'm a number one contender dog, or I'm going to fucking fill up a soccer stadium. That's what he would say. But Joey would be, he would leave after he said that. Why you were laughing? Fuck this shit. Fuck up the door. He would, we would be hanging around the comedy store. He would say some shit like that and they just walk away on the punch line. Just walk away. He's like, you just, it was just a such a master showman. Walk away on punchlines. Well this fucking podcast is over folks. Yeah, Josie all goes to shit. Chad Mendez is a motherfucker that was a goddamn awesome. Phil Davis came back strong tonight. You'll Bagby five in a row, son. Okay. What do you guys think about hunt and verb? What about that shit? Doom. The deadly and elevation 7,500 feet. If you remember when any UFC fight ever, and if you remember mark cut fight in Denver and we fought Rothwell yeah. Might have been the worst heavyweight fight in history. They won't come back to Denver, but heavyweights on the car do so bad. Wait, title, heavyweight title hold. You have three weeks. Oh, you weigh 305 pounds. That's everybody division right now. He's got to lose so much weight to, he's got to lose 30 pounds. You're crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:41:36       Just fucking, I like just seeing hunting when well, but also like every day if we're doomed wins. He speaks really good Spanish. They reschedule it again. He fights in Mexico against Kaine. I mean, God, Hey, if King Cup comes back, they're going to get my mail again with cane. I think they want to learn to gamble. It depends on how well this card does. This card does really well in Mexico. It sells really well, but now the problem is canes, not the headliner anymore. They even said like Dana White said publicly like, we can't go to Mexico without cane and Diego's hurt to go to the big draw this out. So Diego's out by Amazon. The other, the Mexican kid. What's his name? Eric Perez. I don't know. I went, God, is he out too? I don't think he's that bomber, man. All these guys getting injured, but it's just the weight division.

Speaker 1:          02:42:29       Oh, big ball. He travels Brown. What's up? What's up? This is what I wanted to ask you guys about you two guys especially. What did you think and get the soft, what did you think about the only thing that's a situ situation that was really weird. I got popped allegedly for high growth hormone. Right. And then they say that the test is ridiculous and there's a bunch of people who weighed in on it that are apparently experts in the protocol and the way everything was handled and then the UFC for the first time ever rescinded it. If it doesn't fit, you must acquit. It's tough enough to really get that picture of come lean like, oh wow. Yeah, you're not on protein in, you know what I'm saying? Cause he's in his forties and he never looked for them. We've seen that picture. It's insane.

Speaker 1:          02:43:15       He makes like one of those grill as they should brought up there and all of those aims jacked and shredded it. Just pause for the HGH. But he also got his ass whooped, but he didn't get to do have you work for HGH? He tested for elevated human growth hormone levels and they don't have a baseline for him. That's the problem. They don't have like people have weird and dodginess levels of all sorts of hormones. There's certain people that like, like if there was a reason why Pete, some people were depressed, why are they depressed? They have a bad low levels of serotonin. You know some people that have had head injuries have low levels of testosterone, so he might just naturally have some weird thing when he hits 40 gets super shredded. It's on 20 pounds of muscle and that's how it goes like it's true. I'll look at the pictures of him. See that's normal. That's when he hit 40 we all look like that man. He does look retarded coming in the next expendables live. He's done. Kung Fu since he was three. That doesn't look like a real APP. If I had an APP like that, I would quit working out forever. Just take pictures and shit.

Speaker 1:          02:44:18       I did it. It's tiny. Made the best tabs of all time. Suck it. I'm over. That's a best abs maybe ever. Right. I'm not mad at him. He's a cutie pie. No, but no bullshit. Have there been better abs? No, there's been different ABS. I agree. That's a set of ABS. That's not, that might be the best abs and MMA fighter is ever exhibited. And Lee, because he's such a kicker like that's kicking is all your core and your abs. Your obliques to help them though. Did it great if it's the Olympia. Yeah man. Dude, he hasn't fought in a couple of years and he fought Bisbing who is a cardio machine. Bisping has a 34 till you have like a 38 beats per minute. Look at that big brown, a heavyweight with a 38 beats per minute. Resting heart rate. Same as Michael Phelps. What was me in the pool swimming though? That's why his heart rate's so low. Exactly. He's just not even sure it's taking a test. I hate that one. Happy. But I was 37 yesterday, yesterday, two days ago or 100 pounds. My friend.

Speaker 1:          02:45:16       He just kept me. Nah, that's impressive man. How much do you walk around that? Seriously and not in fight shape. Like 50. Oh that's not that small. So one 15 you dropped down to one 25 how much water, how much of his water with 10 12 pounds. That's a lot though. Your body weight per percentage. You've got to think about it as opposed to like a heavyweight. 10 pounds ain't shit. But when you get down to like one 25 10 pounds, I'll do okay. Got to Ireland at 18 over I think high e but it was just like, it was the easiest kind of her hat cause my diet and all this stuff. I mean I've got my super tuned in everybody. This company makes all my meals, it's called the gorgeous mix. My buddy makes all my meals fit. It's 15 meals a week that are vegan and then I eat meat because I am not um, Vegan, Vegan. I was going to make a root cause they use sexual use. Gluten.

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       I hear there's a lot of gay people that like hot dogs. So I don't think, Oh shit I can do you. But do you eat gluten? I try not to. You try not to. You try not to too, right. I uh, I did gluten free from my last camp. I can feel that much of a difference to the guy. Like you were either one of you guys is burned off so much. God Damn Glucose in a day. You know, you're burn off so much sugar that I don't think it would hurt to have like a little pasta in your diet. I just don't think we're talking about a regular person. Yeah. It's not that I think about a hippie. I get some pasta maker gummy bears. Before I hit miss thing, I was like fucking Anderson Silva for reals man and a bag of gummy bears. Someone gave me a small bag of gummy bears, right.

Speaker 3:          02:46:52       For training. I don't know what it is. Where their marijuana gummy bears or where they gummy bears that like my candy gummy bears, gummy bears. I don't know. Oh, for before someone gummy bears. So just the sugar. You need sugar sugar avenue. It's not bad to have some simple sugar if you're working out the way you're working out cause you're burning off so much fucking calories. You got to think about just grappling workout what your body feels like when it's over it and they say the best thing to drink is chocolate milk because it has so many different things. It has the case in the armory would know the ratios, especially if you've got raw chocolate milk. Then you have the enzymes in there to help break down the milk. Where do you get Rami Khouri response because it's hard to break down when it's pasteurized.

Speaker 3:          02:47:43       Yeah. When you had raw chocolate milk that would be so he's saying if I had a cow suck the get you can get raw milk from some health food stores like sprouts has pitch and just take some on it. Protein now dude, I'm telling you raw raw milk if you've, if you're like a non a non milk Trican person, I have a totally different reaction between drinking regular milk and drinking raw milk. Totally different reaction. I don't like any of that shit. Raw milk just seems to have no, my body has no problem with it and just digest milk. Milk is not milks weird fucking water, but it's not bad for your milky ass if it's sweetened, unsweetened almond milk. Oh, that's sweet and gets a lot of sugar. Dude, Duncan Trussell call me up the other day. He's like, dude, I found the best thing almond milk.

Speaker 3:          02:48:26       It's so healthy. It's so good for you. I go, I goes, it tastes really good. He goes, yeah, I go, that's sugar. And he goes, really? I go, look at the fucking look at the label and he goes, oh my God, 18 grams of sugar per serving. I go, yeah, sweet. Yeah, you're drinking water like it. Yeah, but usually if it tastes good, it's sweet version. Unsweetened tastes like ass. Hold milk tastes like they just get a little sour, but you can make your own. It's really easy. All it is is you just take raw almonds and you blend them up. Same with making hemp milk. You take how much you eat. Almonds and drink water ossification actually creates the mill. Right, but is there a benefit in that? I'm also vacation like they better health, but I mean if you're making a smoothie or something and you need the liquid and you want to get that flavor

Speaker 1:          02:49:10       time than blaming up all means on your own. Being one of those weird owns it's soaks almonds and tries to get some of your own almond milk. No benefit, no benefit. Is this going to make you dig, wrote no. It's going to make you smarter. No. Is it going to help you recover faster? It's gonna remind you how awesome milk is. Some coffee and cocoa pops at that shit.

Speaker 3:          02:49:29       It's raw milk guy like my daughter has rheumatoid arthritis. Would it be good for them? Raw milk and milk or raw goat's milk would probably be even better. Okay. You shouldn't pasteurize goat's milk is way easier for your body to digest and cows. Yeah, you want to limit the inflammatory response and the problem with anything pasteurized is it kills all the natural enzymes that help you digest it. So it's going to cause a greater inflammatory response. So rob, we'll help you out with it. Is it about goat's milk that makes it even when pasteurize more digestible. Why goat's milk? Yeah, something with the composition of the actual milk, human milk, goat's milk, human milk and goat's milk or more closely affiliated. Then bovine milk, it's just a little bit closer for whatever reason, come on down to the level of growth hormone in it. Somebody was like, Yo dog, can I get that breast milk? You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 3:          02:50:20       You'd think that'd be huge. It's into the supermarkets, the human mouth. This big ass last room is really great. You mentioned that we were really taking a hard look at that because that's the first milk that comes out and that's the most nutritious. Every mammal produces colostrum and she loses though when it breaks down into like a powdered form, cause I know they sell like powdered claustrum need to pour into smoothies and shit, but like what is that even really, it's like a freeze drying process usually. So I think you lose some, but you still get a lot of you to do. Right. Even with Greens or with anything, once you break it down to a powder, whatever benefit you get, it might be substantial, but it's definitely less than it would be for fresh destroys nutrients more than that process though. So it's better than, you know. Yeah. That's rising it. So, so powdered is better than heated generally. Yeah. For most things. Wow. That's weird. Right? Let's go eat. Let's get something to eat. Can you eat late slate? It's pretty late.
