Speaker 1:          00:00:00       I felt that I'd be willing to do a podcast with fresh back from Brazil within hours of landing on sacred American soil, but you're one of them, Josh stuff live. It's a real pleasure to be back. Thanks. Bye Man. What? So first of all, well, let me say the last time I was here, I was like, out of it. I was, I was white knuckling it just. I was, I was hung over. I was tired. It was 10 in the morning. I hadn't slept probably. I'd been on like a late night flight from New York. I was sick. Joe. I didn't know you were sick. You, you performed admirably? Yeah, I tried. I tried to kill it today. Shit. I'm just going to smash it. Week one today. Yeah. Good. I'll, I'll pick it up. Thank you. We'll just switch switch roles. You can sit back and I'll ask you questions.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       Yeah. How you feeling? Question to my own expectations. My own of my own self. Just maybe travel like long trips before every podcast. What? Uh, what was Brazil about a. The UFC great. Ronda rousey fight. Excellent. Pretty crazy time. Yeah. Fantastic. It was, I'm watching her fight is like a. it's like watching some historical thing. It's like I was saying like when people tell their grandchildren. I was there when Muhammad Ali fought Sonny Liston, know I was there when Mike Tyson beat Trevor Berbick and won the heavyweight title. Yeah. That's what it feels like when you watch her fight, like you're not just seeing a fight. You're watching some crazy historic event. It's amazing. She's an. She's just a freak. It was like a freak of all freaks. Beautiful Woman Who's just this insane, furious combat athlete. Nuts. You're the one who's just stepped off a 13 hour flight and is now working all afternoon, so that's good too. That's hard.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       Especially doing this. Yeah, that's true. We haven't. We have pretty easy jobs just sitting around talking to people all day in. We do, we do, but I really enjoy your show, man. You have some excellent interviews. Did you interview that Peter Singer guy? Yeah. That's the Animal Liberation Liberation Guy. He founded the. He coined the term animal liberation and he sort of invented the. He's one of the world's most important bioethicists. Like I mean in terms of just thinking about the morality, he's such a brilliant guy. He's as if it's like an alien just came down to width and said, all right, we're not going to have any more preconceptions about what people think is right and wrong. We're going to start from basics and think, okay, why do we think about the morality of things the way that we do and how, in what ways is that wrong? So like he ends up with these crazy conclusions and people like hate him.

Speaker 1:          00:02:28       For some of them, like saying it's not necessarily wrong to say kill an infant, a newborn infant. Well, how does he justify that? I think it's on the grounds that what's wrong with killing something as a sort of combination of snuffing out the life of, of a, of a being that has the capability of conceiving of itself as having a future. Right? You're thwarting a person's plans when you kill them, you're robbing them of all of the opportunities that they hoped that they were gonna have and you're presumably causing them pain. But if you could painlessly. I mean, if you don't, if you think of life as being an incremental thing that starts from a conception and then gradually evolves up into adulthood and sort of self awareness and consciousness. I mean does it two day old baby have that much more sentience and consciousness and sense of itself than a 22 week old baby in the womb does not a huge amount necessarily. I mean, I'm not saying I agree with it, but he just, he's just a fascinating person to talk to. Does he have children? Yeah, I think so.

Speaker 2:          00:03:31       That's interesting that he thinks that wavy as children because I could see it if you're, if you're trying to make some sort of a logic argument, you know, that you could, you could argue it like that, but as far as like being a human being, the difference being significant in that a child represents potential and child represents to a lot of people represents this insane bond of love that you have with the baby. I, I, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:03:57       I think just to clarify, I think he's only saying like in cases where, you know, the parents don't want it or something. I mean he's, he's not. Obviously if you kill someone else's baby, you're doing a terrible thing because you're depriving the parents of the kid, right? Oh, they're saying like if they don't want their baby, it's not that big a deal in a situation like a Bush as if it was like an abortion. There's some people that are extreme

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       animal rights folks that also believed that there's something about if you did kill a person, at least you stopped that person from killing all the animals. They're going to kill or be responsible for the death of in their entire life,

Speaker 1:          00:04:33       which is, which gets real insane. That's kind of crazy. I don't think he'd agree with that. Well, you want to know real crazy, the lobster liberation movement? No. Yes, no. Yes. There's people that

Speaker 2:          00:04:44       break into restaurants or places that have seafood and keep lobsters and they released them and take the rubber bands off. They're atrophied clause and release them back into the ocean. Those

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       lobsters out stuff of heaven in the ocean and they've had a too good for too long. It might not be stimulating being in the lobster tank, but it sure is safe. I don't know if the lobsters eat while they're in the tank. That's a good question. I don't know how they must be fed. Right? I don't. I've never seen it, if you will, that wouldn't do it while you're eating them. But they always have the rubber bands on their claws so they don't Jack each other up while they were in that tank. I'll probe on top of each other. It is pretty. I like, I, I'm. It is kind of sick. Like I, I have no problem with it because I do eat maintenance so I can't really be a but could have added, but I think there's something just kind of oddly sadistic about sitting there at a table and just being like, alright, I'm going to have that, that I'm going to end that one's life right now and then I'm just going to eat him in front of his buddies.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       Yeah. Well we have a weird thing about. We have like a hierarchy of animals that we love and that's one of the things we found out about Cecil. Oh God, let's say I want to get to, I want to get to this. It's definitely should get to it, but we don't have any problem with even vegans will slap a mosquito and it's biting them like you don't have a problem with that. Not only that, when bugs are really little, like ants will kill it and then brush it off our pants and leave the body on the ground and it's just like a head on our pants and just some little limbs. Just crush out the grand bug guts and then the aunt will be an. I had a friend do that on my kitchen once he had an aunt. I was like, oh fuck, fucking aunt.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       And he just brushed it on the ground. I go, isn't that odd that I don't have a problem with you doing that, but isn't it odd that we do that? We just brushed bodies under our friends' floors and we don't care about it. Just this week. So getting back to Peter Singer, his whole philosophy of animal liberation is sort of that there is a hierarchy of consciousness and sentience that has to be taken into account. He's, if he happens to be a Vegan, but he doesn't think, you know, I've spoken to him. Obviously he doesn't think that an oyster has the same right to life as a lion does or as a chimpanzee does. Right? So you factor in the capacity of the, of the creature to be sent to you and to feel pain and to have a conception of itself and to feel love and fear and those sorts of things and how much it does.

Speaker 1:          00:07:06       That's why human life is probably more important than any other animal's life. Maybe whales with dolphins. So I don't know. Some other animal. It's equally smart as us, but so for him the bugs are less worthy and for anyone sensible the bugs out. Right. But what's interesting when you say like we have these weird conceptions of our own hierarchies of like cute animals and non cute animals or animals that we give a shit about mammals that we don't. What's interesting is that that hierarchy doesn't match up with a Peter Singer with a logical ethical hierarchy, like why are we so willing to be so cruel to pigs, which adjusts as conscious and self aware and capable of love and family and pain as dogs, if not more so, if not more so, but we have these institutionalized concentrated animal feeding operations that just torture. I mean it's torture.

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       I mean, whatever that industry can do to lower the price of a pound of flesh by a few pennies, it will do, including anesthetizing the pigs, get grabbing little piglets by the tile and just smashing their heads against a wall to kill them if they had, if they're not viable anymore. I mean it's an absolute murder show. It's like a. it's an ongoing holocaust of, of, of pigs, but then like little people get arrested for, I don't know, Michael Vick or something and you're doing something bad for dogs. We just don't give it. Give a shit. So what, what paid a singer would say is yes, there's a hierarchy, but let's at least be sensible about the hierarchy, which brings us to settle. Cecil Cecil was a 13 year old lion, which I want everyone to understand that if you're a male lion and you reach 13 years of age, you have killed a fuck load of baby lines. Sure. One hundred percent. How many gazelles have you killed? Lot of gazelles. But also there's a lot of, how do you say, infanticide, trust side, fantasy, side to

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       side. It's not trunk. I'm always want to make an r there for some reason. Well, there are some other types of light fratricide rise. I think that's why infanticide, if that is the correct way of saying he's got no wisdom, 100 percent. But I think that is, uh, that, that's, that's an important point to look. My friend Steve Rinella calls them charismatic megafauna and he's like, there's all these animals that are charismatic megafauna that we have anthropomorphized in movies like the lion king and Yogi bear and all these movies and we have this idealized view of what they really are. But the reality of them is so alien to us because we're never in Africa, in Zimbabwe, in the jungle with these lines. And if you were, you'd be absolutely fucking terrified of them and you wouldn't think of them. Like I saw Jimmy Kimmel crying on TV. I was like, Whoa, Jimmy, I want to show you some videos. I'm going to show you some videos of Cecil killing babies because apparently there's a video of cecil actually killing

Speaker 1:          00:09:56       the actual same lion. Interesting. Allegedly, it might not be him. It's hard to. Yeah. And it's also a condescending to the people who live there. Like, I mean, there are farmers there who were like, well, yeah, you're allowed to be little teary about a lion. It eats out damn cows all the time. Like, or like elephants, they just stomping all over our crops. So yeah, let's save them. Absolutely. But we should have a little bit more empathy for the human beings who were there to. Yeah. Well the human beings. Here's the other one. The poachers, the lives of poachers. Okay. Now, let's see.

Speaker 2:          00:10:28       I am not defending this guy. I don't, I'm not exactly sure what happened. There are several different versions of what that guy did and some of them are, uh, according to book. They're, they're, they're, they're fine in legal. That's not the only line that's ever been killed like this with a collar on it. When the lions are off the preserved area, it's legal to kill them. That's right. Not saying you should kill them. Just saying if they're not there, but here's the, here's the thing. But they lured him off. I think that's the difference, right? Here's what's legal to kill as much as you want poachers, people, they can kill people there every day. Then when they have these hunting camps, when they go out looking for lions or more, more often, it's lions are fairly rare. Most people, when they go over there to hunt, they want to hunt something to eat with big antlers they could put on their wall.

Speaker 2:          00:11:15       Yeah, like a neeland or a gazelle or something along those lines. When they go to hunt those occasionally they'll find people that are there and they call these people poachers, and what they are is extremely poor people that are. They're shooting these animals without a permit and you know what they do, they murder them. They murdered these people on a regular basis. I have a friend who went over there for a hunting camp and while he was there, they, the people that he was with shot a poacher, shot it right in front of them. There was a man and that man had a, uh, a gun that was like a, they have makeshift guns, they have, it's an actual gun, but they don't have real bullets. So what they do is they create a, with like a piece of metal, they find pieces of metal and they get some gun powder and they create a firing pin and they have to light it like a musket.

Speaker 2:          00:12:02       It's crazy. I mean these are extremely, extremely poor people. Not only that, they find their camps and a lot of their camps, they'll find evidence of witchcraft. So they have this white powder that they'll find these camps and they put this white powder on the wrists and they believe this white powder. It's been blessed by this switch. Doctor makes them invisible. So this guy was standing out in the open, like right next to a tree when the, the, the game wardens, the people that live and work in Africa and handle this stuff, shot this guy, they shot this guy and you know what they do with them when they shoot them, they fill out paperwork or they don't. Sometimes they just feed them to the hyenas. And this happens every day and this happens all the time because they have these huge hunting preserves, right? So these preserves might be 20, 30, 40,000 acres, maybe more enormous.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       One of them, my friend was onset. It took eight hours to drive from one side of the ranch to the other. So you're talking about an enormous piece of land. And in this enormous beautiful land, you'll find insanely poor people. And these insanely poor people have nothing. There's no, it's dry. There's no supermarkets, there's no, no one, no government support. There's no where for them to go. So what do they do? They, they take a risk and they go and try to find animals to kill in these hunting preserves and they get shot and they get killed and no one gives a fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:13:21       Right. So the economic, the fund, the underlying problem here is the economics. Exactly. Right. And there's another, there's a case, I mean some people say, well look, trophy hunting, you may not agree with it, but the $50,000 per person to spending can then go into maintaining a preserve that actually protects a whole bunch of of lions. Now I'm a bit sort of conflicted about that because there are only a few tens of thousands of lines left, right. Even even fewer elephants at ink.

Speaker 2:          00:13:47       So there's some areas, it depends on Africa. There's some areas where they have to call elephants because they have too many of them.

Speaker 3:          00:13:52       Yeah, I mean, I mean that again, that's because of the encroachment of cities and more and more know losing so much of their habitat. You might have a lot of elephants in a particular small area, but overall the number is going down dramatically across the content. Yeah. Well, I was reading a piece the other day that was saying that, you know, within within 15 or 20 years, it's entirely possible they just won't be any African elephants left.

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       Well before. So forgive me for anybody who's listening to this, but Louis through has a great documentary.

Speaker 3:          00:14:20       Yeah, and I heard him on your show as well. I'm a huge fan of Louis and I've seen that episode a couple of times.

Speaker 2:          00:14:26       Well, one of the things that was pointed out in that show, there was a lot of animals that were on the verge of extinction that are now thriving because they live in these giant hunting camps that's really fucked. You look at it and that's what the guy running the hunting camp said, you know, when, when Louis was kind of confronting him about this, he goes, listen to me, I have an it guy to clocked. Yeah, that's an intense moment. How incredible. That guy saying that, like, Whoa, like this. This guy is like,

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       he's just at his wits end.

Speaker 3:          00:14:54       So Ricky Gervais' was coming on facebook about the, about cecil the lion and the trophy hunting and everything. Because he's a big animal rights guy and he'd super opposed to trophy hunting and he was saying like, you know, sure, maybe this is going to fund something better, but would you allow some asshole to like shoot a cancer patient if he was willing to donate a million dollars to cancer research? That's not how. It's not how it works. If, why doesn't the asshole who just donate if he thinks he's doing a good deed to fail lion conservation, donate the $50,000 and then just don't kill a lion?

Speaker 4:          00:15:25       Well, well he's, he doesn't want that. He wants to line in his house so he could climb on top of it and jerk off to it

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       and that's the whole point and I don't know what he likes. Then it comes back to like, you know Jon Ronson, you've had him on the show. So you've been publicly shamed. Guys love that guy. By the way, Bill Hader does the best John Ronson impersonation you've ever heard. I had bill hader and a judd apatow on huff post live a couple of weeks ago and for some reason we were just talking about what books they like. I don't remember how it came up and uh, and Judd apatow was like, I'm really into John Ronson and I kinda thought that John was my special little fetish I think is so great, you know, but he's not like an a list writer in America at least I don't think that many people know him. And then Bill Hayden was like, Oh yeah, I just listened to the audiobook of his book and I was like, I just listened to the audiobook of his book and Bill Hader starts going brilliant John Ronson infestation.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       But anyway, what happened to this guy who shot the lion? Reminds me a bit of what John is always on about, about like. So he's had to shatter his dental practice. There's like a sign, there were signs of abuse all over the dental practice. His big business has ruined. He's had to go into hiding. I mean, is that fair? Like should you. Yeah, he did a shitty thing. I completely don't agree with, I don't understand like trophy hunting. I understand hunting, hunting for meat, but I don't understand trophy hunting, uh, but we all pile on and we all love being so self righteous and so sanctimonious about it at the same time, once again, as we're eating all those pigs that have been tortured and people button into chicken burgers that have been, that that's another tortured animal, but the moment there's something with a big fluffy main and it has a cute name like [inaudible]. Do you pronounce that name? Cecil in America. Is that Cecil? Okay, cool. Sessile sounds better. Yeah, that's, it's also like if the, if the, if the lion's name was like goth or something, I think people would be. I was upset. Sessile is the cutest name. No one who's called sessile has ever done anything wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:17:27       Wrong. Cecil though is like a cool black guy who hangs around pool halls. You know, Cecil can hook you up. Cecil, is it that? Maybe that's where it cut may west. That's where the pronunciation difference comes from. Does it come from African Americans? That's interesting. I don't know. I don't know, I mean there's a lot of different words that they pronounced differently in England. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, of course. And in spelled differently

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       like tires of the why. That's always bizarre when I read like English auto mail, auto magazines, higher t y r e s, m, I think that the idea of this killing this animal for no reason other than you want to kill it because you like killing things is what freaks everybody out. The idea that this sociopath could go over there and kill these beautiful things. Um, and that's, that's what freaks people out. But what's going on right now? Why this guy did this is people are killing lions all over Africa. Like, here's really fucked up. This is what's really fucked up. There was an article that said that Jericho, Cecil's brother had also been killed by line and everybody was like, oh my God, I can't believe this. We lost Jericho. This is crazy because it's Geragos got a name and then they said it was a false alarm. Worry not, it wasn't Jericho. It was just some poor

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       line that doesn't have a name. And then I'm like, okay, this kind of highlights what Rinella was saying. It's charismatic Megafauna, you give them a name and all of a sudden there's something significant about them. They they are. They have a personality like Simba. That's right. That's right. I had to. So I'm. I'm out here in La this weekend doing an episode of my new show. I just launched a podcast, which is a panel of three, three comics sitting around talking about the news each week. What's it called? It's called we the people live so people can get. You should follow us at a WTP under school, live on twitter. Too much work or you already. You just got off a plane. I got other people who have like who they are, their brains to your list as a clever enough, there'll be able to write it down.

Speaker 1:          00:19:24       You say that you need to go on my twitter and my facebook and read some comments on instagram as well. Or Youtube. That's the fire pit. That's the pit of stupidity or or you can go to WTP livestock. There's the other plug plug now, but it's. It's great. It's a lot of fun. So we had Greg Fitzsimmons on the, on the show last night and uh, we, we just got a bunch of people together in Hollywood and Fred Stoller who was a writer on Seinfeld. I don't know if you know, Fred did a joke about exactly what you were just saying about cecil the lion. He was like, it's like if someone like had intended, like someone accidentally shot Bruce Willis, but they thought that we're gonna be shooting like Gregory Mcgee and they're like, oh fuck, I didn't realize that I was shooting bruce. Well, I just thought I was going to be killing this other random dude. You'd still be like, no, you'd still murdered a guy. Right? It doesn't matter whether it's Jericho. The shit hit the law and a, the way was culpable. People were

Speaker 2:          00:20:16       set that Jericho died and now they're not upset because it was an unknown line. So no one is calling for the head of this person that shot this unknown lion. We're stupid. We're very stupid, but we're also ruined by media. I really believe that media depictions of animals and when you add human voices to them, like zookeeper movie that I was in, you know, you, you, you do, you do fuck with people's reality. I think we're not designed to take in the media. I really don't believe that the human body and brain is designed for films and I think when we sit down there and we watched some epic movie with lions, like there was a movie called bears. Did you ever see that movie? Yeah. That was a nature documentary. Low was. It was all over it. There was another one called cats, right? That was recent and it was about big cats. They don't show what the fuck they really do. And the bear documentary, they didn't show the bears killing cubs or bears kill cubs. Like that's what they'd like to eat. That's one of the reasons why female bears are so aggressive when they're around their, their babies. Yeah. That's. It bears the Disney nature. Film bears. Yeah. They didn't show that male bears come out of hibernation and they go looking for cubs first things they try to eat.

Speaker 3:          00:21:29       I mean, I'm not sure that I buy your thesis that things like animated movies like the lion king screw us up, but I do definitely think that if there is something which is a pseudo documentary like what you're talking about, like or something like one movie that I hated, I couldn't get through more than 20 minutes of it was march of the penguins.

Speaker 2:          00:21:45       Hi. Had opened that about it. I was angry about it. Why? Well, there was a bunch of it. One of the things that were mating for life and I was like, you know, that they mate for life and they're monogamous. I'm like, first of all, they only meet for a year. I'm like, I could do that. Second of all, they look exactly the same. It's not like one penguin is Jenna Jameson Pega and the other ones that rosie o'donnell, penguin, they're fucking penguins. What's the point in cheating? Just pretend you're

Speaker 3:          00:22:10       cheat. It's like as if everyone was just identical twins,

Speaker 2:          00:22:14       right? Yeah. Well it was also, there was a part of the movie and this really did happen when I watched it. Um, I was watching and there's those leopard seals that feed off of the penguins that I didn't even know existed. I didn't even know it was a real animal until that movie. And it's this amazing piece of an animal with these huge teeth. And I was like, whoa. I was like, this is incredible. This thing's a wow. And there was a family in front of me and this mom was upset at me that I was happy when the leopard seal was eating the penguins. I'm like, what about the, with the penguin is fucking slaughtering these fish. Like the hierarchy took. There's a leopard seal right there. Look at the fucking incredible beast of what about the leopard sale? It doesn't need to have a right to live. Does not mean in all forms. Can we up the star, which is the penguin

Speaker 3:          00:22:58       march of a leopard seal, Josh. That's what I hated about it. It was this, it was a way of, it was a total anthropomorphization, if that's a word, which probably isn't of, of penguin life. It's like it's, it's portraying them as basically humans in little costumes. Right? And it's creating all of these, I mean clearly made up relation. It would be like, you know, you'd see a shot of a penguin walking away and it would be like I'm young. Jimbo wandered off with a heavy heart to think about, to think about how he'd just been jilted, but like you have no idea what he's probably wondering over there to take a shit.

Speaker 2:          00:23:33       I don't know. Taking this shit is trying to find some fish to eat. He's got three brain cells banging around inside of stupid little bird head.

Speaker 3:          00:23:39       Yeah. So I think there is a. I think like companies like Disney probably should be held to better account to be more responsible about communicating to children the reality of animal life rather than making it all sunny.

Speaker 2:          00:23:50       Don't want their kids to watch. Like pull up this video. Jamie lion killing cub, male lion killing cops. I put this up on twitter and I thought twitter took it down. But what actually happened is I retweeted somebody else tweeted it and the guy who tweeted it got attacked so hard that he decided to delete his tweet. He's just like, fuck this. Thanks a lot Joe. It was just too much, but the reason why he got in trouble is because there's line is killing cubs. It's this is reality and it's not just an isolated instance. Like a line. A screw loose is one on a baby killing rampage. This is what they do when a lion takes over a pride, one of the first things he does after he chases out, go ahead, play it. Jimmy. One of the first things he does after he chases out the male line is kill all of its babies. Of course. And this is what's going on right here.

Speaker 3:          00:24:39       Genetics. I mean, I, I interviewed Richard Dawkins recently as well, and I've got another event coming up with him in, in October, which is going to be cool. And He, you know, he wrote the selfish gene, meaning like the unit of evolution is not the individual and it's not the species, it's the gene. Now that line is killing those cubs because what better way to make sure that it's genes ended up getting passed on and spread out and procreated through the, the um, the extended the pride. There's no better by making sure that all of the other babies from the other guys

Speaker 2:          00:25:09       don't go. I mean, he's just following instincts. That's why wouldn't you. This is part of the picture, and again, I'm not in favor of killing lions and people say, this is cecil by the way. I don't know if that's true. I mean how it, you know, I don't, I don't know, but they. Cecil has been studied. I mean these are part of an Oxford study or was. Yeah, yeah. I interviewed the, the actually the head of that study, the Oxford Guy. Fascinating stuff that looks different because he's younger in this video and apparently when they get older they get the black around their main. I don't know if that's true, but, but bottom line is this is also part of the picture, so by showing only the beautiful aspects of the line with flowing main walking amongst the cubs that are his and the female lionesses. You don't see the actual whole animal. You don't see the thing. You also don't see the reality of the poaching and what these people go through that lived there and they and then it's easy for these hunting wardens to murder those people that are trying to survive today is so much more disturbing.

Speaker 3:          00:26:07       Yeah, but then there's this big question. I mean, so there's the. There's the ethics of actually taking the lives of these animals and the hypocrisy of loving dogs, but not pigs and of eating chicken, but then going crazy about cecil the lion, but then at the end of the day, I always come back to the fundamental fact that we are living through one of the greatest extinction events in history that's been unleashed by humans. If in 50 years time we don't want to live in a world that has no lines, has no African elephants, has totally polluted overfished waters where you kind of eat tuna anymore because there's so much mercury

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       in it. Like we've got to find ways of dealing with this and if the poachers are part of that problem. I'm not saying you put a bullet in the head, but you got to do something. See with approaches that are getting killed in Africa though most, I mean there's different types of poachers. There's poachers in Africa that are killing elephants for their ivory and it's. This is the most unbelievably brutal aspect of it. When poachers kill elephants for their ivory, the amount of ivory that they get, they get like four or five elephants that they kill. I think they they. There was a big story a few days ago where they killed five elephants and they, they just chop off their tusks and leave there. The bodies to rot. They got like $200 for those tusks and those tests on the black market are worth tens of thousands of dollars, but that's fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       I mean this is not hearing, but you're also talking about people that are just so fucking desperate. We can't even understand the pint, but there are a lot of desperate people are a lot of desperate people born desperate. They're stuck. There's, I mean, if you're in that environment. I have a friend, his name is Justin wren and he. He'll be on the podcast soon again. He's been on a few times. He was, he still was an mma fighter, but he went over there. I'm on a trip and met some pygmies in the Congo and fell in love and just was like, I need to help these people and we've been donating money and they've been building wells. They've built 16 wells for these people. They're. They're bringing in medical supplies and doing all these things to try to help these people, but his. The feeling that he got when he was there, it's like there's no one helping these folks.

Speaker 2:          00:28:14       They asked to do anything they can to survive. These people that are on these hunting preserves that they're calling poachers, a lot of them are just trying to feed themselves. They're just. There's no where to go. There's nothing. There's no options and it's legal to kill those people and then the idea that it's someone legal, it is legal in Africa to kill these people. It's not legal. It's legal. Yes it is. It might. They might turn a blind eye to it. It's always. It's always illegal to kill them. I'm telling you, it's not really. It's not in Africa. A poacher. You can shoot a poacher when they are on your property and it's legal, you fill out paperwork and you're done. And it not only that, but he was being done by what they call, they call them professional hunters, but they're essentially game wardens.

Speaker 2:          00:29:00       So like if you were um, you know, uh, if you were in Montana, oh, you were elk hunting and you, when you shoot an animal you have to have a tag for it, which means in Indian state allows shooting tiger poachers on site offers money to informants. Yeah. India in India, right? Yeah. But yeah, but it's the same thing. It's not, it's not uncommon to be for it to be legal to shoot poachers, but that's because they're down to only like a few thousand lines or a few thousand times. In ancient India it might be even less than thousands. It might be like hundreds of of tigers in India. But point being it's not just legal like it's done every day. Everyday. Africa is so big. This is the other thing that people need. We, we have this perception, our head that Africa is something like America, you know, well we know what life is like in America, so we expect life is like that in Africa. So if these people are over there in Africa and they're shooting lions, these are terrible people. We the same sanely hard place to live. Insanely awful place. You have a lot of ways, many, many parts.

Speaker 3:          00:30:11       I think people know that. I don't think people have any illusions about what Africa is like. The only time we see Africa on the news is when some horrible, horrible shit goes down. Or when Bono is playing some, some, some charity concert to raise money for them. I think if anything, I mean I've got friends who live in Nairobi and there are lots of things going. I mean the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is doing all kinds of stuff. There are lots of, there's lots of entrepreneurship. Cell phones have have revolutionized the continent because all of a sudden people are able to like send a text message to the market that's three, a three hour walk away and ask what, what price? You know, fish or rice or getting that day and they can actually plan instead of just guessing like there. There are a lot of good news stories in Africa. I'm not downplaying how terrible it is, but the idea that the only way that you can survive on the continent of Africa is by poaching is by being an ivory poachers. Come on. These are the people who are saying food poachers.

Speaker 2:          00:31:00       These people, these were that are getting shot in these game preserves. A lot of them are just hunting gazelles or something along those lines. Right? Just hunting for food. They have nothing. Mom, what I'm saying is I know all these stories. I'm aware of all these stories. I read them all the time, but I think unless you have feet on the ground in Africa, unless you actually go there and experience it firsthand. Everybody that I've talked to that's been there, so it is another world. You might as well be on the mobile with the Moon, the moon. You can be on the phone as well on that. I think I know the information, but I think I haven't internalized it and that's what happened to my friend Justin when he went there, he just just like, Jesus Christ, I got to do something and he was just struck with it because I don't, I don't think. I think don't think it gets in. I think the information hits the brain. It stores it, you know, one plus one is two. It's like it's all there, but unless you were there, I don't think you could truly understand what, what that place is like.

Speaker 3:          00:31:53       Yeah. But I think that's probably true and we're also so caught up in, in our own little worlds. I mean especially in this country because America is so big and it's so easy to, to maintain just live inside of the American cultural bubble essentially that it's not, it's you have to actively proactively try to seek out other sources of information and other experiences. Otherwise it's very easy to just coast along here and not really think about the rest of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:32:17       It's also kind of ironic that the last big lion story that came out of Africa was the editor from the game of thrones. It got pulled out of her car by a lion. She was taking a photograph of it and the lion was like, Ooh, I think that's an open window. Just dove into the car and literally pulled her out in front of her friends and they're all screaming and the lion killed her right in front of everybody and that's what they do. They're fucking killers. They're nature's cleanup crew.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       Anything with a limp, anything that looks like it's easy to take out, you know, the thing that they didn't even eat her, they just killed her. It was killer for a goof. Tied over, taking pictures.

Speaker 3:          00:32:50       It's like shocks like to just say the aussie surfer that was crazy and attacked by a great white and like the, the whole point like. So sharks don't like what we taste like right when they're to after big fatty seals, they don't like scrawny humans. We're all bound in sin you. And so they'll just take a bite to see if they like us and then they'll spit us out. But if it's a nine foot great white, then that little taste is enough to kill you if they rip off your leg or a torso. So I've always felt like, especially as an Australian, were that this was constantly just in the background of your mind as a possibility if we. Because we're always at the beach, like I would prefer it if they actually liked us. So at least one of us is happy and it's just the ignominy of Bay of both being killed. And then also the shock being like, Eh, I didn't even like it. Fuck you sean.

Speaker 4:          00:33:37       Well they, they are the ultimate cleanup crew. They're just dead behind the eyes. Black Marbles for eyeballs. Love Him. I was like a shock nerd as a kid. Books about sharks and would always. Yeah, because I don't really go in there. I don't, I don't surf. But apparently surfing in South Africa is like fucking jogging. Were lions live is. Yeah, South Africa and South Australia. Both at the bottom of that, because great whites like you know, cool is and that's just where you find them, so fuck that. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck that. Apparently they're finding a lot of them off the Malibu coast right there. Seeing them on a regular basis and some reason north in northern San Francisco, that area, they breed out there. I have a buddy, my friend Alex Ross who runs a shark works, which is actually a porsche, a man like, uh, the, uh, take Porsche's and modify them and he calls it.

Speaker 4:          00:34:32       That's the name of his company. Shark is a shark fan. He's a freak. He told me there's like, they, they, they breed out there, right? Like in northern somewhere. Yeah. But like what the fuck man. Like right there, he's got a damn monster. That's a good thing to what is called side. There aren't that many people swimming in San Francisco Bay. There's a video of them taking a surfboard and pulling it behind a boat in South Africa just to show there's this one area that's just overrun with sharks. And as they pull this surfboard behind the boat, these sharks just, Pam just hitting the surfboard, knocking it up in the air. And you're like, what? They're amazing. Who wouldn't love him? It's like a lion sale. Like I love him. Maybe that girl who lost her arm, she'd probably wouldn't be really too much into them. Did,

Speaker 3:          00:35:13       did. Uh, did you see this, this petition that they've got just a. This is from left field, but it just popped into my head and I don't know why about the 19 year old kid who, um, who had sex with a 17 year old girl who had told him when she was 14 and she told him she was 17 and now he and so he went to jail and now he's on the sex offender registry for 25 years and he's not going to be able to have a career because he wanted to do software engineering. And as part of his parole, he's not allowed to own a computer. He's not allowed to own a smartphone because he's classified as a pedophile. Even though she was physically mature. He thought she was 17. Her parents lobbied the judge and Sheila with the to plead and say please let this guy off, but he, but instead the judge threw, threw the book at him basically saying like, you should understand that sex is supposed to be a meaningful and like holy experience between two people who love each other. You shouldn't be hooking up online like this. What? Yeah. Where was it moralizing? Uh, it was in. Can we check that is either. It was in the midwest somewhere, I think Indiana. So now there's like 150,000 signatures on this petition to try to get this guy off the sex offender registry. You can be on the, there are people in the sex offender registry who does urinated in public. I know again now.

Speaker 2:          00:36:30       Yeah, I know a guy did that. He's a pro pool player. Apparently that's a story. At least he went outside and he took a leak outside of this bar and apparently it's close to a school and because he's within x amount of feet of a school he got, he got caught by the cops and they, he's a sex offender for exposing himself.

Speaker 3:          00:36:46       Yeah. Yeah, like what? Hear I hear, here's the stats. I was looking at this yesterday. So in six states you can get on the register if you hire a hooker. Wow. In, uh, in at least a dozen states already segregating and hookah, hookah, hooker, it sounds like cheery nestled debbie. Uh, and in, uh, oh yeah. Here it is.

Speaker 2:          00:37:15       To be a monster debate. Rages over man. Nineteen. Put on sex offender registry for 25 years. Zach Anderson Nineteen. Met a girl online via hookup APP, a hot or not last year on the APP. Girl says she's 17, however she is actually 14. Zack traveled 20 miles from Indiana home to Michigan and slept with her. He was arrested at the girl's mom. Became worried about her whereabouts. Um, whatever this uh, this petition is Jamie, find out where it is and let's give it out online and fill it out.

Speaker 3:          00:37:42       Hopefully that's a change.org thing or something. I signed it. I mean, this poor guy.

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       He's just a kid, man. When you're 19, first of all, it's so hard to tell the difference between a 14 and a 17 year old. It's so hard. How do you know there's girls that are 14 that looked like they're 18. You got to. We all know that. Yeah. Look, I, I met a girl who was 25 who looked like she was fucking 16. People vary wildly in, in their appearance and if you're 19 you don't have a whole lot of experience in judging that shit. No, that's right. It's not like he fucking got her drunk or drugged her or any of that like this. Is that the judge, first of all, they should take him and drag him in the same place. They dragged that fucking surfboard. Just take him and feed them to the sharks.

Speaker 3:          00:38:25       Dan Savage has been going on a lot about this status to say because he liked that guy. Yeah, he's great. He's been on a couple of times and he's. I mean his. His point is like, what the hell? What

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       the hell legal rationale is there for saying that sex is supposed to be this meaningful thing between two people who love each other and so you shouldn't be using hot or not. Yeah. It says, who says the old judge? And the prosecutor on that job, the, when he was getting laid, there was no hot or not. He wasn't getting the ladies and we probably mad that he lost his virginity at 42 probably fucker. Yeah. Or never has maybe switch that robe on me. One judge that got caught, it was had some sort of a masturbation device underneath the robe. A condom. Yeah. Yeah. They caught him in the middle of his proceedings. She had some like fucking pump on his dick. Crazy assholes. That's great. I'm wearing one right now. That's why I'm having such a good time to. I don't mind that I. I welcome that here.

Speaker 4:          00:39:20       But this guy is a judge. Okay. He supposed to follow the law. We don't want his editorial comment on the nature of civilization and whether or not people shouldn't, shouldn't enjoy sex recreationally. That's true. Because that's what he's saying, that it's got nothing to do with, with the offense at hand. I think anytime a judge says something like that, you should it like, fuck you. You're not a judge anymore because you've obviously lost your, your, your balance. You've lost your, your perspective. That's not what we want from you. We want for you to be an expert in the law as it's written in the law, as it's written, as opposed to protect people not protecting anybody here. Well, let's try it and the whole point of the sex offender registry and that kind of stuff is to protect kids and parents from predatory, potentially violent, repeat child rapists.

Speaker 4:          00:40:06       Right? I mean that's ideally what that offender registry should do. Hat who, what kids is it protecting? Prosecute this 19 year old. Does anyone seriously believe that if he has a smart phone at any point in the next 25 years or whatever it is, that he's going to be like preying upon multiple 14 year old girls who look like this? 17. Come on. The whole thing's disgusting. It's just, it's just madness that someone thinks that they could do that. I have. I have a theory about that and I've talked about it on the show before that I think that one of the main problems that we have with law enforcement and with police and even with judge and prosecutors, is that it becomes a game. It becomes a win or lose if the guy gets off, you lost. If the guy, if you convict him, you scored and I think we have this built in thing about playing games and I saw, I think it fits very keenly into that dynamic that we have about winning and losing and I think that's why cops can find some sort of a justification for, for leaving evidence, for planting evidence.

Speaker 4:          00:41:07       Like that guy was shot the guy in North Carolina and drops the Taser and remember that we shot the guy in the back and then drops the Taser out his body. Like in the POC. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's a lot of that where it's, they get locked into this trying to win thing and some people with cheap, like people playing pool to like move a ball when you're not looking to cheat. Why? Because they want to win his petty playing pool. Yes. But when you're trying, when you're a cop, you also have a

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       quota. You know, I had this guy on Michael Wood who's a former police officer in Baltimore, who's enlightening means to how fucked up Baltimore is. And how fucked up to police department is and how crazy it is over there. But he was like, you get in trouble if you're not arresting people, so if no one commits crimes, you're fucked. You're fucked as a cop because they're like, that's bullshit. These people suck. Like it can't be that it ever. It ever cleans up. It can't be like, hey, you know what, I'm Baltimore just became Beverly Hills and everyone is like this nice old rich Jewish couple that doesn't do anything wrong and no one knowing commits crimes. So we could just, uh, relax you like to fire department, sit around and wait for something to happen instead of being forced. Like if the fire department had quotas, how many fires you put out today, Wilson, there was no fire. They'd be going around fighting fires. Exactly right.

Speaker 3:          00:42:25       That's a good point. Right? So there's a misalignment of incentives basically because the people who are supposed to be doing the cracking down on crime actually have an incentive for there still to continue to be some crime so they can keep doing the cracking down almost reminds me a little bit of the military industrial complex where like the Pentagon, the Defense Department is supposed to be about defending us, but if we don't have wars to go into then they're kind of redundant. Exactly. It's actually good for them when there is a war ironically. But you would expect that the people who are like who are trying to seek our security would not be one in wars because wars are bad things.

Speaker 2:          00:43:03       Yeah. I think the overall dynamic of how we operate is flawed fundamentally on so many different levels that we just sort of try to patch it up and keep moving. And I think you could make an analogy about this hunting thing. I mean it is kind of fucked that you're talking about conservation when the best way to conserve is to get money from them being murdered. I mean that, that's really what you're saying. The best way is to go over there and there was an article in huff post actually today that I was reading and I was kind of laughing about it because it was wrong on a lot of different levels and it was about hunting for conservation and that this model doesn't really work or the argument doesn't hold up and one of the things they brought up was that $335,000 that that guy had paid to go and shoot that Rhino and what that Rhino, what they were saying, well if this rhinos and danger, these rhinos are endangered, yes, but that rhino was an unviable male.

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       Like he was old and he wasn't breathing anymore. Not only that, he was killing young male rhinos and female rhinos and so they had targeted him for. They were going to call him. They were going to kill him anyway. So the reason why this guy was able to spend so much money, shoot this endangered rhino, it's because they were gonna shoot it anyway. And they said, look, if we can generate a tremendous amount of income, and he. I had him on the podcast and he said the amount of money that he paid was actually small and the reason why it was small was that all the negative publicity actually fucked up the conservation aspect of it because there are people that would pay half a million even more for that Rhino. And they didn't because they were scared of being having their name thrown into the pool.

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       So this cory Knowlton guy went over there and spent the $335,000, did everything legally, and he was in a lot of ways just like cecil or just like this Walter Hill guys, Cecil. So that. Then that brings us back to like the social justice, like twitter storm thing, right? That you're actually, you're ending up with an inferior outcome to the outcome that you could potentially have because the people who could pull off the best outcome, so afraid of us old jumping down their throats on twitter and ruining their lives, getting them into a justine sacco. But then it also gets to like, Whoa, is that really the only way you can save these rhinos? The only way you can get $335,000 and you have to have someone, you have to get some guy who wants to kill one and say, okay, you like killing shit, alright how much some of our docs, but what else?

Speaker 2:          00:45:26       Who else is going to pay $350,000 to save rhinos? I think this is the way if people hate this idea of hunting for, for conservation, if they hate this idea, the best way to stop it is to really ramp up conservation as efforts to really, really ramp up the idea of non hunting for conservation and to tell people like, look, we can. You can generate like Zimbabwe apparently where this guy was, they generate some insane amount of money. I don't want to quote it because I don't know if I'm right, but I read various amounts, but I think it was like $200,000,000 a year just from hunting just from these people coming over there to hunt. And someone said, well, that's the only three percent of it goes to conservation. That's probably right, but it's still three percent of $200,000,000 or whatever the fuck it is.

Speaker 2:          00:46:15       That's a lot of goddamn money for people who have nothing over there. How much could they make from tourism though, for people that are looking at the lions? That's a good question. Um, and that's, I think maybe the solution in a lot of these situations. But also another thing that has to be carefully considered is that at least in some areas, in some places you have to manage populations of animals because if you just leave nature onto its own nature will wipe out animals as well. Nature doesn't really give a fuck about, like wolves don't care if they wipe out all the elk really don't care. They don't have it in their mind. They have it in their mind. What can I kill and eat? Whether it's dogs or whether it's elk or whatever. It can track down and kill. So you, the United States has a problem and a lot of the western states, because they reintroduced wolves and they reintroduced wolves and there was a really interesting video about it, how wolves are changing yellowstone national park and they sort of highlighted the, the positive aspects of it, the negative aspects of it or the elk population are getting decimated because these elk are not used to wolves because they didn't develop with wolves and the wolves are within the last few generations.

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       These wolves have been introduced here and they wanted to keep them within a certain population. They wanted to keep them within a few thousand wools and the whole country. Well, they've gone way, way, way past that and so now they want to start hunting these wolves and they do hunt these wolves in some areas, but they have all these people that are freaking out about the hunting of the wolves. So you shouldn't hunt these walls, but you have to. You don't like you. You have to manage these populations because if you don't, then you have starvation. Then you have a disease and then you have them encroaching into livestock. I have a friend who lives in northern BC, British Columbia, and he is a hunter up there, and he also has cows. His neighbor's cow was killed in the middle of the night by a pack of wolves. He said, you don't even know what terror is and when you're sleeping your house with your children, and he said, you have glass windows that protect you from the wild, right?

Speaker 2:          00:48:08       You're not living in a fortress, you're living in a normal house and you look out the window and you see 20, 30, wild savage, murderous wolves tearing a cow apart in front of you screaming and cheering and ripping this thing apart, and they'll do that to your kid. Do that to you. They'll do that to anything they can get ahold of. They don't have morals there. Their idea is to stay alive. That is their programming there, and if you don't manage their population, you're fucked. So in that area, you can kill as many wives as you want. Right? Right,

Speaker 3:          00:48:42       right. Where he lives. I mean, kill them every day. It all comes back to this misconception that people have, that, that nature is at a, at a permanent state of equilibrium, and the, we shouldn't tinker with it because there's some, some, something kind of fundamentally precious about a particular state of, of nature, but the reality is almost all states of nature in the world right now have been impacted by human civilization already. So as you say, like the wolves, the reason why we have to reintroduce the wolves because we killed them in the first place. And the relationship between the number of elk in the number of wolves is already out of whack. So we need to be able to manage it. It reminds me a bit. I was talking to a marine biologist I think obviously in Tanga will fly specks South Pacific nation talking to this guy about whaling.

Speaker 3:          00:49:28       And I was talking about how opposed I am to wailing. I don't think we should be killing whales. And he was like, you know what? Because we already have killed so many blue whales and humpback whales will. The big beautiful wiles, uh, the minky whales, which are the only whales that are currently being killed by the Japanese and the Norwegians and so on are crowding out the, the bigger wiles from having their populations being able to come back up. So it actually, from a sustainability standpoint, you may actually want to have some culling of the minky whales, which are the sort of little shitty, the ugly stepchildren of the while of the whale species because they're eating all the plankton and they're reading all the stuff that the blue whales and the humpback whales could be using to resurrect their populations. And in Australia that people go crazy sometimes, especially known Australians, abet, abet, kangaroo cows, but you got to kangaroos breed like rabbits. They go out there and shoot Kangaroos to bring down their population so they don't starve to death sometimes because have so many of them.

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       Have a good buddy who's a famous hunter, Adam Green tree in Australia. And what he explained to me is what's really crazy is they brought over certain animals and when they brought over certain animals, then they had to bring over certain animals to deal with these certain animals. And one of the things they brought over as rabbits and they just fucked up, man. They fucked up. And these are just terrible. They have so many rabbits that will. They brought over the pain to the rabbits. Yeah, right. He said they brought over the foxes to deal with the rabbits will. They didn't anticipate as a fox is killing everything else. Ground nesting birds. So they're, they're, they're destroying these ground nesting birds and everything else. I can get all. They didn't have a mission. It's not like they programmed their DNA. Say, okay, you foxes are only attracted to rabbits.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       Go kill rabbits and foxes kill everything. Cool. And they also kill a lot of calves. They kill one of the things that Fox has left to do and it's a horrible thing. They, they can smell and they know when a mother is about to give birth to a calf. So they wait until it's coming out. And they literally pull it out of her vagina and eat it in front of the mother. And that's what they do. They do that with deer. They do that with anything they can get ahold of. It's just a part of nature. And they're, they're having a real problem with that. The Fox population is just booming. So they've set up these crazy fences. They've hired these contractors that build these enormous fences and Australia to try to keep the rabbits out. The problem is, it takes a while to build a fence as they're building the fence, the rabbits got in and they just fucked like rabbits inside the fence. And now the rabbits are over there too. And they don't know what to do about it. They're trying to figure out how to handle it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:55       It's just, that reminds me. So in New Zealand, I'm half New Zealand, my mum's a New Zealand, uh, and I was just back there a few weeks ago. My grandmother passed away. She was 100. So like congratulations to her made. Yep, that's right. That mark, that's the goal, right? I mean, you mentioned being a hundred anyway, but one of the interesting thing about New Zealand in terms of all of all of that conversation around pests is that it's possibly the only country that actually has the capability and a major movement to do so to take itself back to pre to what the ecosystem was before humans arrived. So they like. I don't know if you know what a key way is. The bird, not the fruit, short flightless bird that just wanders around like New Zealand is just lousy with all of these really, really evolutionarily dumb animals like birds that don't fly, which when approached by a Predator just stands still in the hope that the Predator isn't gonna come after them, which worked prior to the introduction of western species, but now that there are boxes and they're like, it's not a great survival tactic to just stand still while the Fox is is coming after you.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       So there's this massive movement in New Zealand now, which my uncle is heavily involved in, in the prime minister is heavily involved in. To actually genuinely eradicate all of these small mammals that were brought in by by humans when they came. So it's such a green country. There's such environmentalist in New Zealand. They really, really get their hands dirty with all that stuff that's super, super natural about everything. But it's funny because in the rest of the world

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       if you're an environmentalist you'll probably an animal lover and you're probably maybe not a bloodthirsty person, but the Kiwis, the New Zealand is I just so blood test because they love killing small mammals. So like it's almost like a part of your patriotic duty to like just have trap, settle over the place. They go out and there's just like a bloodied old Fox with its head smashed in by a trap and they're like, oh good. We did know we did our job for the environment today. It's great. Well there are hunting magazines in Australia. They're really fucking weird because hunting magazines in America, they show like a deer or an elk, like something you hunt for food, you know, like, look, this guy got an elk bar that's like 500 pounds of meat. That's awesome. Well, hunting magazines in Australia have those as well, but they also have guys holding up foxes and feral cats and my friend gave me a copy of this magazine and I was like, do you got fucking dead cats in your magazine?

Speaker 2:          00:54:16       Like kitty cats? Like my cat, like this is fuck these ones and feral man. Yeah, they're feral. They didn't make the cut. They didn't make. They didn't make the team. They're out there trying to hustle. Yeah, the killing all the birds, killing all those little flight records and killing all of the rabbits and killing all of the. Anything else I can get ahold of. New Zealand also has a lot of invasive large game species. It's one of the big destinations for hunting, like stags stag is a type of elk. It's like a similar to an l and it's an enormous, beautiful, majestic creature, but nothing kills them, but I don't have any big cats over there like we have in America. We have mountain lions, we have bears. Those all killed the calves. Like the bears kill more than 50 percent or as much as 50 percent depending on who you ask of the Moose that are born, like as they're coming out.

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       Same with the Fox. Do they find the mother as it's giving birth and they literally killed the calf immediately. You need it. It's one of their favorite things to eat, so it keeps the population low. There's sort of a balance to that, but they don't have that in New Zealand. So New Zealand, they just have these free roaming stags. They're just massive and they have no predators, so it's a huge hunting destination, so people fly 16 hours to go to New Zealand. They have all these animals and you could bring the meat back so you can bring back hundreds and hundreds of pounds of this insanely delicious stagged meat and it's one of the big hunting destinations in the world and you can kind of call it trophy hunting because everybody wants those antlers as well. But the meat is like the best meat in the world. It's incredibly delicious and so good for you.

Speaker 2:          00:55:50       And so rich nutrients that it doesn't get like the, you know, the, the, you know, like shooting lions are. And also it's not like stags were in danger and they have to shoot them. You don't even have to have a license. That's what's fucked up. You don't, you don't have to have tags. Like in America it's hard to pull a tag for an elk, like say like New Mexico. New Mexico is like prime elk territory. They have these enormous elk in New Mexico and they, it's just a majestic. And if you can get lucky and get a New Mexico elk tag for hunters, like wow, I'm going to get the milk. You have to sign up for it. You get, it's almost like there's a lottery

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       and you get picked. Say like 100 people sign up for tags. Maybe like 10. We'll get a tag. And so you keep trying to get a ticket to the opening ceremony of the Rio Olympics or something. Next year I might have to apply. And then you've got a one in a thousand shot up being accepted. You can probably. Well, and also in the same way you could probably also get a scalper to buy, sell you a ticket. You could probably scalp a tag here. That probably helped me a black market for them. I don't even think it's a black market. I think it's illegal. Like outfitters get a certain amount of tags and so that they could sell their tax for like 25 grand or something. Exorbitant rate and then do it like that. Twenty five grand. You could fly first class to New Zealand. You could screw the tag 16 hours though.

Speaker 4:          00:57:01       It's a long flight. You can drive to New Mexico. You have your own car, sleeping intent. My friend from Australia actually came and hunted in New Mexico. He flew all the way from New Mexico, ironically and hunted in, in new Mac or flew all the way from Australia, hunted in New Mexico and wrote this big story about it. Cool. But um, so it's complicated. It's speaking of the, of how good the stags taste. Like. I was amazed. I'm always amazed when I go back to New Zealand and about how much we're missing out on great produce in America just because of the proliferation of, of industrialized farming and and the, the dearth of great natural food. I mean I was, when I was back in New Zealand, was staying at this little bed and breakfast had these eggs for breakfast, just two fried eggs, like the yolk was bright red and it stood up like more than an inch above the rest of the, the egg and the white was just perfect.

Speaker 4:          00:57:54       It was flavor. Tasted like an egg that I haven't tasted in years and years. I was like, well, he's come from and she's like, oh, what just popped down the road? We have a few trucks and we just put up this morning. They are just fresh from the backyard. It was like, that's what an egg. That's just all I'm doing is eating an actual leg, which I haven't. I haven't had an actual egg in ages. When are you going back? Uh Oh. To New York to New York? Yeah. Light on a red eye. Shit. Why get some eggs? I have 22 chickens to get eggs every day, man. I take eggs on the plane. I don't know if they'll let you. Well, it's not coming from another country. Let me see if I could show you. I have an image on my instagram of how incredible the eggs look like.

Speaker 4:          00:58:32       Jamie, you see if you could find that, but yeah, my eggs or like a dark dark orange. Beautiful. And it's because my chickens run around free. That's another thing when you see like vegetarian fed chickens, like you see that like grass fed chickens, you don't want that. Chickens are fucking dinosaurs. All right. They. They eat everything they eat. A lot of bugs ate. I fed my chickens a mouse the other day. I didn't want to, but this is a story. I've already told them, the podcast, so I'll. I'll tell us briefly as possible because it was very conflicted about this. I came home, I was on the road and my family had found a wounded hawk in our yard and this goes back to the hierarchy of animals argument and they found this wounded hawk or something was wrong with its wing, it's broken wing and it was a juvenile hawk.

Speaker 4:          00:59:16       It was, it was, you know, conference call but a small. And so, uh, they picked up and put it in a box and they wanted to feed it and they had to get it to the veterinarian on Monday, but they were trying to figure out like what wildlife organization save these hawks. So they said, well we have to feed this thing, we have to figure out how to feed it. So there was a pet store that's open that sells pinkies, which are baby mice. And so they fed this hawk, these baby mice and it kept it alive over the weekend and they gave it some water with an eyedropper. And then there was one pinky leftover and my daughter wanted to keep it. Let's keep, you have to keep. I go, honey, this is not going to live like it needs its mothers milk. The mother's not here, it doesn't even.

Speaker 4:          00:59:55       It came. See it's, I mean it's only a few days old. And I was amazed it was still alive and I said him, I went, what are you doing? Like you were going to do something about this. And so the two options were take it to the pet store and give it back to the pet store, which they're going to feed it the snakes, that's what they sell them for to sell them for food or I give it to the chickens and the chickens to kill it. Like the hierarchy of animals. Like you just, you were just feeding these fucking things to hawk system. Like what the hell? So, um, you know, we made an executive decision and I decided that I was going to be the one since I'm the killer, I go out and feed it to the chicken. So I opened up the, there's some of my eggs.

Speaker 4:          01:00:31       Delicious. See, look at the color on the yoke. The. Yeah, like you done. Just don't get that from the supermarket. No, that Goddamn l you ca tech a hot sauce to. I hate that this morning I had some of those exact same. That's exactly. I have that all the time with the Zucchini bread. I'll have an egg sandwich. But um, so I put the pinky in the chicken. I have this big huge chicken coop where they all 22 of them run around. I mean they have, it's like, I don't know how many hundreds of square feet, but it's an enormous chicken coop. And where do you live? I live out in the burbs. I live. I coyotes dear in my yard, but I put this thing down for a second. I mean one second. And these chickens dove on it. They're murderers, little fucking dinosaurs. And they were biting each other's face.

Speaker 4:          01:01:15       Two steel pieces of this, this little tiny baby mouse from each other. Right. So goes back to the hierarchy. And when you, when you said that birds are dinosaurs you made, did you see the story about how the, how scientists have now I'm sequenced the genome of woolly mammoths. Yes. Which means that within the next 10 or 20 years, we're going to be able to actually recreate woolly mammoths and bring them back. Should we want to China. They're going to do it in China just like they've recreated like Paris and all these weird city. You've seen that? No, I haven't seen that. Oh my God. They have these ghost towns in China where they've recreated famous European cities and no one's living in them. They don't know what the fuck they're doing. Or like an Eiffel Tower in China. They have everything. They. It's so bizarre.

Speaker 4:          01:02:01       I look at this like these. These are. This is a real recreated city in China and they're ghost towns. There's no one living in them. I mean, I did know about the ghost towns, but I didn't know that they will replicated off other existing cities. China's replica of Paris. Go to that page, Jamie, because it's fucking insane and there's lot of people that aren't aware of that. It's an entirely depressing ghost town. That is an exact replica of Paris. Go to full screen if you would in the apartments look like perusing and upon their exact. The exact, it's insane. And look at the Eiffel Tower, you can see like a that they were like just regular skyscrapers in like a neighboring city. Yeah, it's really, really, really strange and they haven't just done it with Paris but like this is, this is abandoned, this is what's really fucked about it.

Speaker 4:          01:02:47       Why they have been in the of people moving into. I don't think it worked. They had an idea to build something and have a bunch of people move in, but. And everybody's like, what? The Chinese government, they just forced people to live there. I think they're just sort of slowly but surely becoming more capitalistic. Yeah, but they're no less authoritarian. They're having a big crackdown in China. It's much more authoritarian than it's been in the past couple of decades in terms of like anti free speech and just forcing people to do whatever the whatever Beijing wants them to. Right. You're right. But capitalism as far as their ability to earn money and that's the apparently a huge issue that's in China now is the haves and the have nots and how baller everybody wants to act and behave and it's become a huge part of their culture like flossing and having the finest of everything to find his bag and the finest watch and the fines. If you're, if you're a CEO of a company, you must have a home that is bigger and more grand than anyone working for you or the other competitive companies that are, you know, other also have ceos. You have to have the biggest. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:03:50       Oh, it's incredibly consumerist. China and I read an interesting piece about how different Asian cultures spend their money and one of the points was that Chinese, Japanese people, Japanese and Chinese culture is like totally different. Japanese in Japan, people when people earn money, they will usually put it towards making the home as nice as possible so that you go into a Japanese home and it's beautiful. Outwardly. People aren't so obsessed with like flashy things in China. People will live in an absolute shit hole if it means that they can afford like the best watch or the best car or like the best handbag. So there's like a lot more kind of outward consumerist, almost like you say, capitalist style, con consumption conspicuous consumption rather than just sort of feathering their nest the way that the Japanese home bodies too.

Speaker 4:          01:04:39       What was interesting, it's like a repression thing, like a response to oppression, sort of like Catholic school girls, Catholic school girls, you know, everybody knows I grew up, I, I dated a girl that was in Catholic school when I was, uh, in high school and she was a freak. She was just such a freak. And it was because everything was like, you're going to Howl, sex is bad and you get that girl alone. And she was just bought bananas just bonkers. Yeah. I think that's what happens with the repression, you know, some preacher's daughter type shit.

Speaker 3:          01:05:12       Well, they're also coming from a much lower also coming from a much lower place. So if, you know, if dirt poor, and if you've just had a, you know, the past couple of decades, be your big boom, and then I suppose you want to show that you're profiting from it more than a country like Japan, which has basically been rich since the sixties.

Speaker 2:          01:05:28       Yeah. They like a hybrid of like a communist and a capitalist state right now there's sort of like,

Speaker 3:          01:05:34       well they're not, I don't think it's fair to call them capitalists because it's best capitalism should be about the free exchange about entrepreneurism. Right? And the ability of individual human beings to start their own businesses and to trade with one another that is still not the way that the Chinese economy runs. But I think what you're alluding to is the fact that they are rapaciously pro money and desperate to, you know, to enhance their, their economic growth as quickly as possible. So it's not like they're, you know, Mousey tongue said, uh, you know, when someone, someone said that the reforms that he was bringing in, or maybe it was Deng Xiaoping said that the reforms that he was bringing in, what kind of capitalist, uh, and shouldn't he have more of an allegiance to communism? He said, you know, black cat white cat, as long as it catches mice.

Speaker 3:          01:06:21       Ooh, clever bastard. Not always so good at things. They're so good at saying, you know, like Sun Tzu's art of war. You read that shit today. Like, damn at that dude nailed it. Right. So you know, they want to make money. They don't give him no, don't give a toss whether you call it capitalism will come from. I think you might describe it as a kind of. It's almost like a 19th century mercantilist like regime. It's almost like the British empire was or something where there's, there wasn't a lot of freedom for individuals to, to prosper off their own bat. And there were a lot, there wasn't a lot of free industries. So you would have like big state supporting industries that, for example, ran like cartels, you know, only one company was allowed to import cotton into Britain or something like that and that you, these cozy relationships between mega conglomerates and politicians and the government. I mean that's Kinda what it's like in China.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       So it used to be that you got a signed an occupation saying the way that we think of Russia or the way that we think of Cuba that they tell you, hey, this is what you're going to do and so you go do this and you get paid x amount by the state and that's all you get. But that wasn't good for business. Like you got to give people an incentive in order to push harder and to innovate and like you got to, they have to know that that juicy watch is like dangling from that string, like a carrot in front of them. That's what makes them push and that's where they fucked up. And that's where they sort of see. They'd see that about America. Like look, these dummies work all day for Alexis. They just want that car. So bad and they see that billboard as they're driving home in their fucking shitty Hyundai. Not that Honda is are Shitty by the way. I like that actually. Really Nice. Now I was in one this weekend in Brazil and I was like, these things are like fucking Mercedes now.

Speaker 3:          01:08:05       You know what I. I'm driving a Kia here. I always thought of kids as being like crappy. It's fantastic. No, not bound anymore. I got an upgrade like at the Avis Guy gave me an upgrade on

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       it because I'm some elite thing or something or some credit card or whatever that I've got and he was like, oh, I have a gray Kia. I'm like, what? Are you kidding me? You upgraded me to a key. I'll. Thanks a lot buddy. Some upgrade me to the worst car in the world. No, it's great. Well, this is the golden age of automotive engineering. All cars are show that they've learned so many lessons from the past few decades at all cars that the United States used to be known for having Shit cars like we used to make shitty fucking cars. We made really cool looking cars in the sixties and then for 20 years we just shit all over the, the people that were buying cars and you had to be like a martyr to buy an American car. Like a Japanese car was cheaper. It was better engineered. It would break down less and for most of automotive history you're talking about like starting in the eighties or something?

Speaker 4:          01:09:03       I think it was the seventies from the seventies on when the gas crisis hit in the 19 set, I believe it was like 73, 74 American muscle cars and American like big cars, like the cadillacs, the things that people really loved about American cars, those signified America. You know, when you thought about automobiles, you thought about those big cadillacs, they'll show a smooth, cushy rides. No one was making those in Germany knows and making those, that was a true American product, but then gas became insanely expensive and once the gas crisis hit America started making four cylinder mustangs. That looked like shit and everything just fell apart and they've. They were really unreliable. Then there was also the issues with unions. The issues with automotive unions, the union workers wanted to get paid a fuck load of money and I had a buddy who was a union employee in Detroit and he told me like how they used to do it and it was just ridiculous.

Speaker 4:          01:09:57       The, the, the demands the unions had and what they were able to achieve in bargaining. They would have a job that one person could do easily eight hour day job, but two people would take that job. There was, it had to be a two person job. The union demanded it, so what they would do is one guy would show up for four hours a day and then he would leave. The other guy would show up four hours a day. So you had both punch in, you know, but one guy would like punch in at 9:00 and he would go fuck off for four hours and then he'd go back and the other guy would relieve him and you know, they would just switch off like that. And the company car companies would have these massive long term liabilities, right? Because then have like pension programs that were defined benefit pensions instead of defined input pinch out and that might not be the correct economic way of saying it, but like instead of you put into your pension and then when you retire at you get back what you put in.

Speaker 4:          01:10:47       It's we will pay you x amount for the rest of your life. Like a form of social security. I mean it's even more weird than social security. It's like a form of guaranteed corporate welfare for all of the unionized employees for the rest of their lives. After they retire. Yeah. Ends a lot for a company to be able to bear and that's why they moved all their things overseas. I mean that's what happened when they started just shipping everything overseas and then ironically Japanese companies started shipping their things to America. Like a lot of Honda's are built in America, like different Japanese companies. I don't know how the fuck it works now. One of the biggest Mitsubishi Plants in, in the Asia Pacific was in Australia. Like why? Why are they building it and doing it in Australia and I don't know. They must have got some sort of a deal.

Speaker 4:          01:11:30       I don't know how it works. And then South Korea came online and started making good cause like the key is now. Right. The Honda is, are fantastic. They're, they're luxury one that they make that one that looks like a Mercedes. They sort of ripped off Mercedes design. Yeah. What's that creek twice or. No, that's not it. What is it not on the Elantra? Is Genesis equus or something like that? Yeah. Uh, I mean, but I've, I've heard you talk also about like the, the muscle cars of the fifties in terms of like the, that still in Cuba and still working and running. Right. I went to Cuba or was it this past new year's? No, like two a year and a half ago. And Man, it's just incredible seeing like cruising around Havana. Ollie's old. Cool. They love those cars. They're still going tanks they call them. Yeah. They call them Yank tanks because they built these enormous metal fucking buildings that you could drive around and those was 55 Chevy's and things along those lines.

Speaker 4:          01:12:26       Do you think, was that while I was going to say, do you think that the American industry is ever going to be as innovative as it was back in the fifties and it's never going to rule the coop? Um, it's gonna be real tough to rule the coop, but they've made an insane comeback. The new American cars are incredible. I drove one of those Cadillac escalades. That thing is a marvel of engineering. The entire screen, the entire dashboard is an LCD screen, huge lcd screen that controls the dashboard lcd screen that controls the navigation. Everything is magnetic ride control. So you go over bumps and it's like butter, incredible engineering. Like the car is beautiful. They ride gray. It's an enormous car, but it rides like a small car. Like when you drive one of those big cadillac escalades, that thing feels like you're driving like a mid sized car.

Speaker 4:          01:13:11       That's. This is what it looks like inside. Gorgeous. They take, they took it up a 100 notches. I mean it's an amazing car. I almost bought one. I can't remember close, but I went with the instead because lexus is a. They go, uh, they're, they're based off of the Land Cruiser and the land cruisers. One of the best platforms for driving off road. They actually have a lift. He press a button, it lifts the car up. So it gives you more ground clearance on the lexus or the linkers. Lexis is the same car as a Land Cruiser. Amazing Lexus ls five 75 70. Yeah. Is this same exact car as the Toyota Land Cruiser? It's just they, it's like they call it a Land Cruiser and drag. They just make it a little more fluffy on the inside and modal, prettier on the outside. But I'm an idiot and for some reason I'm like, well, what if the apocalypse happens?

Speaker 4:          01:13:58       I don't have to drive on the dirt. Aren't neutral department car like a drop in the dirt. I'm one of those dummies and things I need to cash canister in my car. No fuckin grass. You'll be laughing on the other side of your face when that, when that happens, when it all goes to shit. Now when it all to shit, if a meteor hits, I hope it hits me in the head. I hope the meteor hits my house and I hope you don't even know about it. I don't want. What's that whistling sound? Boom. But I don't want to be that guy. That's like the. Like the prepper. That's right. Right. You know when you're fucking hold up trying to take little cat naps while you're holding a shotgun because you're worried that someone's going to come and steal your canned peaches. I don't want to be that guy.

Speaker 4:          01:14:37       But then I also don't want to be completely unprepared. Like I don't even have an emergency. I live in Manhattan and I don't even have a little bag with some like granola bars in it and some fresh water in case we get hit with a dirty bomb or something. You know that stuff. I have that stuff I have. I have freeze dried food. I have hundreds of pounds of frozen meat because I hunt. So I have like, if I can keep some sort of power on, you know, like by generator or solar, I have food for a long time, but that's not why I do it. I do it because that's what I actually do eat really prepping for doomsday in terms of those that, those cars being so sophisticated nowadays. I was interviewing a guy from, I think it was Gorka who was involved in um, in a, like a test where these hackers encouraged him to get in the car I think.

Speaker 4:          01:15:26       Right. And then they, they hacked into the, like the was, it was recent, right. Really when they shut it off. So they yet now they've turned it off the side of the road. That's right. So you could have like, imagine if you have hundreds of thousands of a particular type of car driving around in America and because they're all wifi enabled and they're all saddled, they've got, they're all on the satellite and everything. You can have hackers or terrorists or just knit a wells or some kind of hack in. And theoretically, I mean they can certainly slow down the car. They can certainly make the cotton, they can certainly screw around with it in some way, but if they could make it speed up to 160 miles an hour and then via sharply to the right, you could be killed 100,000 people like that. Like that.

Speaker 4:          01:16:09       Well, that's the argument for Michael Hastings. You know that story, right? Remind me, Michael Hastings was the journalist that was writing all these stories about generals like he had taken down. He was one of the guys that had taken down to and mcchrystal mcchrystal pace. Find out about it. Um, I remember his name. Yeah. Michael Hastings. Well, his car, he had actually, was it, was that taken down crystal? Yeah, yeah. He did the mcchrystal, right. That's right. So he did that and he was insanely worried about his safety. Yeah. And he was telling people like, look, if I wind up dead, I didn't kill myself, just know this. Well, he died because his Mercedes was barreling down sunset going into 120 miles an hour running a tree. I remember they were like, he committed suicide and not only that, the engine flew from the wreckage. I'm like, there is right there. That's a, that's the video of the car, and these cars today are so fucking computer. There's so

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       much gadgetry and stuff going on inside of them that there are many that argue that not only it has been possible for a long time, but they've been doing this for a long time. He was a good guy. He was a good report. I have is with buzzfeed. Um, well there's a lot of people that believe he was murdered. Yup. There's a pace. I've got a place here in New York magazine, which I just chatted to Jamie, who killed Michael Hastings, reflexively distrustful Egan to make powerful enemies. The young journalist who's Mercedes exploded in Los Angeles one night, couldn't possibly have died accidentally. There's a lot of people that believe that, that will also. He had apparently he had crystal methodist system. But here's the thing. A lot of people that work really hard and that do long hours and are involved in journalism, they take adderall. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:17:54       And adderall and crystal meth or fucking kissing cousins. They're almost exactly the same. I'm not saying that he wasn't really on crystal meth and I don't know. I don't. I didn't look at the toxicology examination, but they could've been lying about it and just. It could have been adderall. Adderall is so fucking common. There's so many people that take that shit, especially people that are on deadlines and they need energy to push through something pretty common in journalism. And so the idea is, oh, he went back on the drugs, he was on adderall and he drove into a tree man or math and drove into a treatment and not. Not necessarily who knows? Who knows, but in speaking of adderall, did you see the story this week that the electronic game is association is going to start drug testing as a game is going to be drug tested for.

Speaker 1:          01:18:35       I mean I interviewed the DS. Yeah. For, for PDS, like adderall and I mean I did. I had a conversation on huff post live with the head of the, of the. Of that. What does it do? The Electronic Gaming Association. It's something that the Srb I think. Yeah. So I had the, like the president of that on, oh, whatever. And a bunch of gamers and like some sports psychologists and sort of ethicists about this and like, it's so weird why we object to doping in the first place. Like it gets very complicated. Like I understand. Oh yeah. Protocol on adderall, right? That's right. So that's what sparked this whole thing because he made those comments. So then they're like, oh, we got to crack down on it. Well that's like cracking down on comics for marijuana if they start drug testing comedy clubs, good fucking luck. Uh, you know what Greg Fitzsimmons said last night on my app, my wonderful podcasts that everyone should listen to, they all cheapy live.

Speaker 1:          01:19:28       What does it WTP live and isn't there an underscore and somewhere handle WTP, undisclosed live on twitter? Who has WTP live on twitter? That's a good point. What the fuck? Some asshole who I'm going to have to be novel possible. Somebody else has that. Exactly. Why would they? I don't know what it is. So many ways with people and if you want to get on our mailing list, you can email info@wtplive.com and what it was greg saying, Greg, Greg Timmins, my buddy greg. Greg Fitzsimmons was a was saying now I've forgotten what he said. Well, we're just talking about about adderall. Adderall, comedy clubs pot. Oh yeah, that's right. He was saying like if you, if you were going to, we want to take Lance Armstrong's medals away. He was like, if you took away every award

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       or prize that you give to people for something that they did while they were on drugs and there would be no grammys. It's true. Right? That's true. Well, Bill Hicks had that great joke about it. You know, you know that I'm about drugs, about every, you know, if you want to stop drugs, like take all your albums and throw them away. If you hate drugs. All those great songs and led Zeppelin, the doors, all that shit. They were on drugs. They're on drugs. What do you think about about doping? Cause I think like so. All Right Lance, glad you brought this up because Jeff Novitsky who busted Lance Armstrong is going to be on my podcast. He was hired by the ultimate fighting championship. The UFC is trying to clear up the sport and they're trying to clean it up by hiring the most knowledgeable anti doping guy ever.

Speaker 4:          01:20:54       The guy who busted the ball co scandal and Lance Armstrong and all that stuff. I had the most fascinating conversation with him in Brazil. We were at a bar and we were talking for over an hour about all the different methods that they're using now to get away with. That's my man. Great Guy. Really enjoy talking to him and he'll be on soon and really empathetic and sympathetic guy and you know, he's not like some evil person is just like some fucking Jack Law here to take down the criminals. He's uh, he's the guy who was sort of seeing both sides of it and that's one of the way, one of the reasons why the people cooperated with him to kind of go after Lance Armstrong. Yeah. So people will say like, all right, well lance, you know, that was the reason why it's bet what Lance Armstrong did is bad is because it's on a fair.

Speaker 4:          01:21:44       Well, Lebron James is. Genetics is unfair, right? I mean the fact that I now feel better after having two cups of coffee then I did an hour ago is unfair be too. Yeah, I mean I'm jet lagged and Shit, but I have a two cups of coffee and for Alpha brands and I'm kicking right in. How different is that stuff from adderall? I mean, isn't it all just degrees? Like maybe we should just a lamp. Why maybe we should just allowed doping? Um, I think to a certain extent, I think one of the real problems with Lance Armstrong said he was suing people that we're accurately talking about his drug use because they got busted and he was going after them and trying to ruin them. He's a, an absolutely and a liar at just a pathological liar, deceiver. But that's. But that's less interesting I think. Then the question of like whether or not the laws that he broke should be against the rules that he broke should be against the rules in the first place, but I agree with that and also there's also an argument that the Tour de France, notice how I said France and that was very impressed.

Speaker 4:          01:22:36       I'm very, very good at the misspelling ties with the one they say that that race is so grueling. There's an argument that it's actually healthier to do with drugs. That doing it with drugs actually allows your body to recuperate in a way that you would be breaking it down and you would be susceptible to rhabdomyolysis. You know? That's that thing that those crossfit people get. Start pissing looks like diet coke, you know? Have you ever seen it? No, I don't. Oh my God. It's awful. When when people have a breakdown of their muscle tissue and then your, your, your, your body starts processing it and it comes out in your urine. Like ultra marathon runners have it. I have a buddy who runs ultra marathons and he says, when you done you pee, it's black like soda or like coffee, it's awful and it's just your body's just, your kidneys are malfunctioning.

Speaker 4:          01:23:27       Everything's just shutting down. Not The fittest guy in the world, but uh, and I'm not proud of that. Are you sure? I am not the fittest guy in the wheelchair and tested yourself. I have not tested myself. I could be. That's a very good point Mike, be. But I think if you're doing as string and all, if you're running marathons, good for you, good for you America. But if you pissing black, your body's telling you that you shouldn't be doing that. Well, what they're doing is they're just trying to push past all the pain and discomfort and show mental toughness. And that's what's supposed to be inspiring is that, you know, this guy ran like my buddy, uh, Cameron Hanes, he ran 106 miles in 24 hours, does a 24 hour race where you had a one mile course and he did it a hundred and six times in 24 hours.

Speaker 4:          01:24:11       He and he came in fourth place, didn't even fucking win. Some dude ran like 120 something miles. This is insane. And he said it's crazy. How can you combine them all? I don't know, animals that's like, I mean, they got beat by a chick too. I think a chick came in third place. Well, she's definitely on the juice. You never know. Uh, I mean just being angry, you know, running on the fuel of eight, they're almost equivalent of 50 iron man triathlons in 50 days in 50 states to promote fitness among youth. Oh my God. But is that fitness is. I mean, are you actually doing good for yourself? If you know 50 triathlons in 50 days? Well his body has the capacity to do that kind of work and my body doesn't. So the argument is, and he's getting more fit, you're better than me, is the argument is that his body is more fit than the average person's body, but he's definitely not doing a service.

Speaker 4:          01:25:05       Like my friend who did it, Cameron, he did it a couple months ago and he said he hasn't recovered yet, so he's still hasn't recovered. He said when he runs, like he still runs, but when he runs he's like, you still feeling that he's not back to baseline to where he was. His times were off. He's, he's exhausted and he didn't even come first. No second. His legs, his legs swelled up. He said almost twice the size they normally are. Yeah. Fuck all that. Yeah. I'm happy here. I'm going to open a BA pretty soon. We got whiskey, man. We can just go hard right now. Let's spark up a joint and have a drink. I would definitely have it be. I think you want a beer? Yeah. Beer. That'd be one. A couple of beers. Great. Look, it's five. 10. I'm Australian. If as soon as the clock ticks five. Every Australian has to stop drinking. Yeah, I'll have us there too as well. That sounds good. It's the law. We've got a few good ones. We've got that. Uh, what does that butte like a dark beer. Black Butte port. Yeah. I love that stuff. Yeah. Um, I, yeah, I think it's a real good argument

Speaker 2:          01:26:03       that coffee is a stimulant and that stimulant helps and if that helps why not adderall. And also marijuana allows you to see things in a different way and if you can do that and maybe write something better, marijuana helped you write that thing. That's not exactly just your creativity. It's also the marijuana.

Speaker 1:          01:26:23       Yeah, and the weird thing is when there are drugs that are not actually performance enhancing but are also banned, like marijuana will be banned in sportswear. It clearly wouldn't actually give you an advantage, but like which ones I don't have any kind of athletic sport is probably not going to be enhanced by meryl

Speaker 2:          01:26:38       and it was actually what you're wrong. They're actually showing, especially ultra marathon runners, they're showing that marijuana does have a significant impact on ultra marathon

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       runners, not just about coordination sports. What about, you know, playing soccer or something and put them out sweet. Better

Speaker 2:          01:26:51       too. That's where it's crazy. No, would you? Jitsu is a big one. Jujitsu. It's really, really, really common for Jujitsu guys to train on marijuana. A matter of fact, I'm better at Jujitsu when I do marijuana than I am when I'm sober. How high can I still be bad? High as fuck. Really high as fuck to the point where I can't even demonstrate techniques. Like I try to forget. I forget how it works or didn't work. See, I'm uh, when I, when you're in it. See when you're sparring. The idea about sparring is okay, we've got this stuff. This is from New Mexico. This

Speaker 1:          01:27:21       really good. You can take it. Yeah, I'll try the new one because I know in new castle and I know. So I'll try. Thanks Jamie. Um, but

Speaker 2:          01:27:28       the idea is that it allows you to get to this sort of zen state where you flow. So the things you already know, they think it's not that good for the learning stuff, but it's actually. I'll thank you sir. What a gentleman. He opens his, he opens one and hands it to me and then he gets his own. What a good man. I do what I was raised, right joe? You were sir. You were. The idea is that it's not good at learning stuff because it just goes in and out, but the stuff that you already know that's in your system that you already have trained down, you know, it's like a part of your.

Speaker 1:          01:27:57       So it's almost muscle memory in a way that doesn't require a lot of cognitive effort. Yeah, like tennis players,

Speaker 2:          01:28:02       apparently fine marijuana helps them significantly as well. Recreational tennis players would tell you when they get really high, they kind of like see the ball better. They can move pool players. It's a huge thing with pool with people you can feel where the ball's going better. The guys who play, they say it gives them like a 10, 20 percent advantage when they, when they smell it.

Speaker 1:          01:28:21       I think there are different types of people who respond to the drug differently of course, because I mean, I, I'm not a huge pot smoker. I'll have it occasionally. Uh, I can only have like a very small amount just so I get that buzz. If I have too much, I start to get scattered and like paranoid and just like I can't focus, I can't do things. I kind of can be creative. I can't follow the plot of like television shows and stuff it. Whereas I know I've got tons of friends who are like, well that's not me. Yeah, well they probably swung a lot of pot to. Yeah, that's probably true. The tolerance thing that's real and also the acceptance of the experience. I think when you fight the experience like Oh high and that's where paranoia comes in. And also I think paranoia is also one of the things that does is it

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       lowers the boundaries that we put up in order to get things done. Like we have boundaries. Like there's a sort of blinders that you put on that allow you to get through your job and get in your car and drive home to your family and not consider the massive amount of variables at the world creates or that the world presents and also space. The fact that you're on a fucking giant, 24,000 mile round ball that's going a thousand miles an hour in a circle and hurling through infinity when he smoked pot, it sort of unveils all of these possibilities and potentials and it freaks people out.

Speaker 3:          01:29:34       Well, I don't get freaked out by that. I mean, what you're describing, you're not taking enough, but that said, well, maybe you will. Maybe I just needed a better dealer or something. Yeah, sure. I don't want to take it on the plane, the uh, but, um, smell this and we'll get you high. Are you, are you allowed to have this as this medicinal last patient I have. Wow. That smells great. Beautiful flowers. What your, what you're talking about there in terms of the doors of perception being kind of shut down. Yeah. During normal behavior strikes me as more of a psychedelic thing. I mean, I've had some of the most in like insightful experiences of my entire life. I don't do them anymore, but when I was in my late teens and early twenties doing acid or mushrooms and having that sense of sudden complete awareness that you are on a rock that's going around this star on the outer edge of a spiral galaxy in a cosmos that is so vast that you, you cannot comprehend it and we have evolved as a species to not comprehend it and to not focus on it all the time because if we actually thought about where we are and what we're doing and how many things could be thrown at us at any point in, in time, we'd go crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:30:45       You wouldn't even bother like aiding. You wouldn't buy like working and eating anymore because everything would seem so, so kind of trivial. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:30:52       Does to many people. I have a lot of friends in the quote unquote psychedelic community that lived their lives around the time they do psychedelics and then the downtime in between. There were the sort of processing it and gearing up for their next psychedelic trip and for them it's just that's their life. That's a part of their life. Like those, those crazy trips and those realizations that is a significant part of their existence and what's make makes life wonderful to them. And then there's people like you that say, Hey, I did it before, I don't do it anymore.

Speaker 3:          01:31:25       Yeah. Well I mean I wonder if there are also like non drug related ways of getting there. Like I, I know this guy got out or a pendant Dusa who's a, a Hindu chaplain. He's the first Hindu chaplain of a Columbia University and yeah. So he

Speaker 2:          01:31:42       hinduism as a religion. But a chaplain.

Speaker 3:          01:31:46       Yeah. Which I guess is the religious authority at the university.

Speaker 2:          01:31:50       Okay. So it's a designation by the.

Speaker 3:          01:31:52       The university. Yeah, but he's just a Hindu spiritual teacher in New York. Lovely guy. And he is just know you can. It's like the Dalai Lama or something. Right. You can just sense this awareness of like him just being on another plane. He is not bothered by the same trivial stuff that distracts us. He is clearly communing with some kind of level of existence that is beyond the material. And I think that that is sort of similar to the mindset that you can get into with psychedelics.

Speaker 2:          01:32:22       Well, I think yoga can take you there if you do the right kind of yoga. I do hot yoga, like a [inaudible] type hot yoga and it's great for the body. It was really is great for relaxation. Like to me, my on some things happening. Like when I do a lot of yoga I was talking about, I got in a car accident, somebody rear ended my expensive Germans porche car and I, I, you know, I asked are you okay? Everything okay. And I wasn't even mad at him, you know, I should've been probably upset that this guy wasn't paying attention or texting or whatever the fuck it was and slammed into my car and cost me a shitload of money. But I wasn't. And I attribute it to doing a lot of yoga that week. I think it calms you down. I think there's something. I mean there's a reason why those skinny Indian dudes have been doing that shit for thousands of years.

Speaker 2:          01:33:02       I don't think they'd just been. It's just like a hobby. And they just stuck with it, but Kundalini Yoga, which I don't practice, but I have friends that do and I have a friend who teaches it in boulder and she's, she's, uh, a firm advocate of achieving psychedelic states through this practice. You get up at 4:00 in the morning and you do these breathing exercises and you want to sit in a certain direction and it's all like very ritualistic, but it's also based on the idea of the circadian cycle. You sort of interrupt your sleep cycle and the cycle of the earth and you, you do these stimulation exercises that supposedly a activate your pineal gland, which is the gland that's been proven to produce dimethyltryptamine, which is the most potent psychedelic drug known to man. And it's related in many ways to psychedelic mushrooms. They're very similar in their chemical composition. And we know that, you know, these, these psychedelic drugs that the brain produces. If you can take them and you extract them from plants and every, the existence, thousands of plants. You have these insanely profound visionary experiences. She says that you can achieve these states through meditation and through Kundalini Yoga.

Speaker 3:          01:34:15       I don't doubt that I don't get out or a bill, you know, he meditates two or three hours a day. That would probably explain why he is the type of person that he is. And you get into weird places when you do that.

Speaker 2:          01:34:27       Well, I do a, I do a lot of meditation in an isolation tank. I have an isolation to wanting to do. Dude. I can hook it up and tell me when you tell me when I'll look it up. Like, well, I'm not here. I was so connected to this, this, this community community. Yep.

Speaker 3:          01:34:41       Put me in touch with someone in New York City. Had a good good. There must be good. Outfit out

Speaker 2:          01:34:45       the word right now and we will get messages on twitter. I guarantee you there's places in New York. When I started talking about this about 10 years ago, a little bit more, maybe like 2002. Um, there were very few of these. Now they're all over the country and

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       me making videos and talking about it. I've had one in my basement when I first started talking about it, the float lab, where I got mine from, which is in Venice, which is the finest float tanks in the world next to this guy in Austin. I was also has amazing one, but they were basically like almost on the verge of going out of business. Now they're opening up new locations, new locations all over the country, all over the world. In fact, a lot of them they have as their option, like how did you learn about this? Joe Rogan is like one of the options because I talk about it so much. That's great. I just, I just think it should be something that everybody should do. I think it's. It's an amazing form of meditation. It's amazing relaxation for your body. It's an incredible way for your body to get magnesium because it absorbs it through the, through the skin, the epsom salts.

Speaker 4:          01:35:42       It's one of the best ways that your body can absorb magnesium and it's a hugely important for muscle recovery and for your health and wellness and relaxation. It's an incredible experience. All right. You heard it here. If you look, if you are a float tank person, I'm going to New York. We're gonna. Hook it up 100 percent. I'm going to put out the word. Awesome. We'll put it out on twitter. Bam. Yeah, that's my tank. Yeah. That's the video that we made. A huge. Yeah, they use me. Yeah. Oh, there we go. That's perfect. I don't even know these people. That's New York. Okay. There you go. Great. Okay, so New York aspire.com flotation. Hey, how about you reach out to my buddy josh steps and hook them up. If you listen to, we reach out to me, send an email to info@wtplive.com and I could use a little posts about stockers are going to say, yeah, this is the place, if they're going to give you the address, but fortunately said who will go through that?

Speaker 4:          01:36:31       It's going to be plastic all over the floor and it goes some fucking dexter house. Uh, when we were talking about the size of the cosmos and how mindblowing all of that is, it reminded me, did you see about this Russian billionaire who has just invested $100,000,000? Yeah. Yeah. Not, not to talk, to listen, to listen in. He just needs mushrooms. You can meet aliens in an hour, an hour and 20 minutes so you could be there. So he's got like Stephen Hawking and all these amazing people on board to. It's the biggest injection of cash to the, of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence in history. I think a guy like hockings just like, okay, look, if you want to throw some money at science, you know, I mean, that's really what it is. It's just science. I mean, if you want innovation, you want to. I mean, it's great.

Speaker 4:          01:37:16       It's a great thing. I personally think that there's, there's two very distinct possibilities. What, I mean there's many, but there's two that I consider all the time. One of them is that this is it, that what we have achieved is exceedingly rare, incredibly rare. And that if the universe is 13 point 7 billion years old or whatever the fuck it is when it started, then it's entirely possible that it took this long for something to come out of it like us and that we are at the front of the line of the idea of conscious life where the only thing that we know of on this whole planet that's not just conscious but conscious and manipulates its environment to the point where we can change the weather. We can do all

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       kinds of crazy shit. Like send videos all to Australia instantaneously. If you're in Australia and I'm here, you can send me a text message with a photograph of you smiling and I'll get it in a couple of seconds. Oh, we could be having the same conversation we're having right now. Yeah. Really, really clearly. And that's just madness. That's madness. I think it is entirely possible that we are as advanced as intelligent life has ever gotten ever in the entire universe. And that all of our searching and longing is really just some Alpha chimpanzee thing where we're always looking for the daddy. You know, it might be a god or it might be a king or it might be a guru or something. We're always looking for someone to show us the way because we know we don't know the way

Speaker 3:          01:38:35       it's possible. It's entirely possible that that's the case. Um, and you're right, that life got started here pretty much as quickly as it could and it evolved into our sort of level of consciousness as quickly as you would expect it to given natural selection. So it's true that we could be at the beginning, you know, we could be sort of the, the, the first intelligent conscious species in the cosmos, but the fact that life got kicked off so quickly and the fact that we emerged so comparatively quickly might also suggest that it's woven into the fabric of the cosmos. That this is a [inaudible]. If it was a really, really, really, really, really rare thing, then you would have expected the earth to be a dead gaseous bowl for billions of years. Many, many more billions of years. And it was. So. I'm not convinced by that. And I think also you might be underestimating just how mindbogglingly huge the cosmos is and how little access to it we have, like the fact that we haven't found anything yet doesn't mean anything. I mean there are a hundred billion stars, Justin, our galaxy. So there are a hundred billion suns, Justin, our galaxy, and there are billions of galaxies in the universe. Every single style that we see in the night sky is inside our galaxy. And of course that's only a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of our little corner of that galaxy. And then beyond that galaxy, there are innumerable other galaxies. Like the idea that we are, as Carl Sagan said, you know, the great scientists, like if were the only intelligent life in the cosmos, that is an awfully large backdrop.

Speaker 2:          01:40:08       Like, why bother? Why is it all. And no one's saying that we're not, we're the only. Well, the, the, uh, there also is the theory that the universe is so incredibly large that not only is there an exact replica of earth out there, but infinity, which is what the universe is supposed to be. Infinite is that not only is there an exact version of earth out there, there's everything that has happened on this planet in the exact same order up to me touching that microphone right there has happened exactly down to the Nanosecond, an infinite number of times throughout space, like that's how big the universe is, but it doesn't mean that someone's ahead of us. It doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that, but it does mean that intelligent is very likely scattered throughout the entire cosmos, but it doesn't necessarily mean that intelligent life has reached a place past where we are right now.

Speaker 3:          01:41:03       It doesn't necessarily mean that, but if but, but I think that you would be well advised to believe that it probably has just because the median is usually a better assumption then the extremes. Right? So I mean the, the likelihood is that we're not at either of the, either of the very, very extreme that we're not at the very first nor the very last civilization. Just statistically, if you were just tossing a coin, you would expect our civilization to just happen to be clustered somewhere on a bell curve in roughly the middle. That's just a less anomalous statistical thing to have happened.

Speaker 2:          01:41:33       Yeah, most certainly. I mean, I'm definitely not decided on it. I think it's just a possibility. It's a possibility that this is it. This is about a smart as anything has ever gotten ever in the entire existence of the universe. That's depressing or not. Or pretty fucking cool. Like where the ballers or the universe,

Speaker 3:          01:41:49       yeah, maybe this, uh, this system that they're going to put up with this brush and billion is money. Uh, I was looking at the end exactly what it's going to be able to do. So astronomers, they're going to be able to examine 1000 star systems for any sign of as being used because apparently radar is a good way of telling that someone is, is there, may have invented it, and it's going to be able to detect a laser with the output of an ordinary 100 watt light bulb from $23,000, billion miles away. That's the distance of the nearest stars. Twenty 3 trillion miles away, there'll be able to spot a laser with the wattage of an ordinary household bulb.

Speaker 2:          01:42:29       What I was going to say about the other possibility is the other possibility is what I believe we're heading towards right now is that we're heading towards a virtual universe and that we're creating something with the possibility of artificial intelligence and the possibility of living inside of some artificial reality that they've created that your brain interfaces with. That there's going to be no need for traveling anywhere or no need even for the type of carbon based life civilization that we currently enjoy and it won't exist anymore, and then we're going to create artificial life and that the artificial life is the next stage of evolution. And then will we are is some sort of a cosmic caterpillar that's going to become a butterfly. And that's one of the reasons why we're so obsessed with shiny brand new laptops and innovation and beautiful materialistic items, is that that has the mechanism and the fuel behind creating those things. Our obsession with these newer, better, greater things. It's fueling the creation of these newer, better create greater things and they're ultimately going to lead to artificial intelligence. Yup, and that's what Elon Musk is.

Speaker 3:          01:43:31       That was just about to say, look at what Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking is saying about if, and you know Sam Harris, who I know is a friend of yours and I'm a huge fan of Sam's and I've spoken to him on huffpost live about this with the idea that we are really not understanding the potential of creating artificial intelligence systems that self improve in a way that they end up getting sort of exponentially more self aware until they're actually outsmarting us and they have in every meaningful sense a sense of their own existence in the same way that we might. In the same way that norm, that biological intelligence does. That is going to be a game changer. The likes of which, as you say, I mean maybe biology just gets extinguished or maybe we. Maybe we end up, I don't know. It's like, you know, I don't, I don't. I'm kind of agnostic on the question of whether or not we could ever upload our consciousness into a silicon based form

Speaker 2:          01:44:25       for that. I'm too dumb to make that. Uh, you know, when, when people start going to the singularity thing, I had a chance to talk to him for a long, did an interview with him for Saifai, sat down for him with him, just me and him chatting about this for about an hour and a half. The end of it. I was fairly convinced that it's inevitable, fairly convinced that it's like if you look at like the invention of the wheel and then you look at the Cadillac that we just showed today and, or the mosque sake. The Tesla is new insane Tesla that he has. It's all electric. Goes zero to 60 in less than three seconds. Yes. Fucking insane. These things that we've created, and these are just the beginning. We're not going to stop there. We're not going to go. Yeah. I think zero to 60 in three seconds. That's good. Let's stop right there. We're not going to.

Speaker 3:          01:45:13       What? I want to stop, but isn't there a. he's making a philosophical case as well, and, and this is why I say I'm agnostic about it because I did philosophy at university and one of the big thorny questions in philosophy of mind is whether or not it's necessary to have the biological substructure of a of a brain in order to have a mind. Could you disentangle those two things? Could the experience of me feeling like myself and feeling like I'm alive be disentangled from the biological reality of my physiology and the gray stuff in between my ears. Kurzweil's assumption, which is basically just taking on faith is yes, you could disentangle that. If you could replicate all of the data that's whirring around in my head right now as I'm saying these words as I'm sitting here talking to you. If you could take all of the things that are going on, all the electrical impulses, all of those neurons, all of those synapses, and you could replicate that in a computer. Then that computer would be me and it would not just seem like me. It would feel like me, like I would be. I could actually be uploaded to a computer and you could kill my body and I would be existing in some really meaningful sense. I would be a model.

Speaker 2:          01:46:24       I think we're entirely too attached to the idea of me or of us. I think we're entirely. You're too attached to the idea of this even being a good structure. I think we are so entangled with our chimpanzee DNA. We're so entangled with our our monkey needs that we think that these have. I would want to be downloaded into a computer and that computer would be me and I would share all my hopes and fears and dreams. Why the fuck would you want those? And we're gonna have like youtube haters that are in our artificial world that we created and we're going to recreate them in the exact same way.

Speaker 3:          01:46:59       God. Imagine the trolls when you're actually inside the computer, inside the Matrix.

Speaker 2:          01:47:04       Well, that's what I'm selling, like haters and jealousy and anger and misplaced fear and homophobia and the the hatred of xenophobia, all these different bizarre, angry things that we have that make up a human being. All these nationalism, all these different strange things that we've sort of just become inexorably attached to in our culture that we're trying to eradicate, but we never seem to quite do. All of those things are a part of the monkey body, right? But that monkey bodies, what we're trying to save, we're trying to save that and downloaded into consciousness. What if we can purify consciousness and remove it from emotion removed from biological need and even sex? You know, one of the things that freaks me out about aliens, not that I believe in aliens, but the the iconic image of the alien is always sexless. They're smooth, they have smooth genitals, they have no muscle there, totally undefined.

Speaker 2:          01:48:03       You can't tell what's a male or a female and they have these enormous heads. Is it possible that we have this iconic image because we kind of know and understand that ultimately the only way we're going to transcend this monkey body is to move past all the needs that we've sort of automatically associated with being alive. Being alive means, you know, you have to kind of find food. I've got to be a prepper. I got to make sure that I have canned foods and my band water. What if it goes down? I got to stay, stay alive. Stuff. It's all live. It's all about the monkey body and that's why people want to be sexy. I've got to get my lips done. They're too skinny and one wants a fuck. You know, all that crazy shit that people have in their brain is. A lot of it is monkey body leftover stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:48:49       Well, I think that's an interesting theory about why the alien, why the model of the cliched alien is like that. Like a more, in other words, a less advanced conception of humans is like Harrier. Racism also plays into this, right? Darker skinned, you know, with features that are more kind of monkey like or something. Uh, and then the more advanced conceptions of civilization is white man with his tools and everything. If you extend that, if you extrapolate from that, then yeah. More hairless, I suppose, less prone to sex, less driven by animal desire. It's also, it's a huge factor in religion. I think we're, you know, religions are so hung up about sex because it's what links us, it's what makes us animals and they don't want to think of us as animals. Then when I think of us as being defined, we are touched by the spark of God in a way that no other animal lives according to religion. So you've got to quash six because the and, and gluttony, because those are reminders that we're just prime, right?

Speaker 2:          01:49:44       But meanwhile, the depictions of God, he's ripped,

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       ripped and he's always wearing a robe because he's modest. He's reaching over and touching people. His fingers go, he's got giant traps and what's great, it's true. God looks at his son, his son's looking great on the cross, beaten to death, and he's got abs and really watch for a dice was for a guy, was living in the Middle East 2000 years ago, but skin of bronze, hair of wool, bullshit. The, uh, the other possibility of a black planet. Chuck d was right. There you go. That. Look at that. Look at God. Beautiful. The dude on the left hind a little robbed. That's what I'm saying, not even, I mean why even draw it? You might as well just make him an alien with no genitals. People back then just had little or Dick's. Is that possible? It's possible, but I've always just assumed that that it's the modesty of the artist like it.

Speaker 1:          01:50:35       It kind of changed the frame of the picture of God reaching down and touching men. If men had a massive schlong just hanging down his leg. Yeah, it would be distracting if you're just giant John Holmes Hog, but look how big the muscles are in these guys. Like these guys have to be fucking crossfitting all day as well as being divine. I mean that guy on the left is doing a lot of fucking weightlifting. That is not a regular body. That's a body of someone who's picking up heavy shit all day long, but it's got a skinny neck. I bet he's never been choked. Maybe that's not a guy who knows how to get out of a choke. No Little Dick Skinny neck, but giant fucking biceps, forearms that does a lot of the. There's a lot of weight lifting for sure. Michelangelo's ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and look at the bizarre image of God being supported by Cherubs. So weird people are religion. Can't see God's Dick Though. Notice that. Nope. He's got a robot. That other dummy was little tiny Dick. God looks kind of. I haven't really noticed this before, but God on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel looks a bit like Meryl Streep.

Speaker 1:          01:51:46       Meryl Streep with a bad because I think he's kind of got breasts and he's, he's wearing like a nice white robe. He looks like an old American actor and I can't remember his fucking name whether it's. John has a little maybe, maybe, maybe. Anyway, anyway, on the, uh, out of just getting better at one girl though. Hold on, go back to that picture. Look at the one that's in the crook of his elbow. She's fucking hater. Hater. She doesn't like that dude. That dude's getting all the love. She's like, fuck that shit. It was a little Dick. Look at her face. She's not filled with love. She was like, whatever, uh, on the, on that question of the evolution of, of humans creating like maybe, maybe computers and artificial intelligence of the next stage and maybe that's maybe the universe is full of like artificial intelligence that isn't sending out the signals that we're looking for when we're looking for biological intelligence. Right. Maybe they don't need right as anymore. They don't need to be losing laces because they were all in, in, in computers. The

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       other possibility which is similar to that and which is very depressing and which I don't particularly like, is that once a species becomes capable of destroying itself, that they usually do, like you can't get beyond like, no, you're not responsible enough to be able to handle the kind of industrial scale destruction, destructive capacity that we now have with nuclear weapons and with coal fired power plants. And with all of our ability. We're so successful as a species that were successful enough to destroy ourselves, but not yet wise enough not to do so. And then maybe that's a trap that lots of species fall into as they try to pass through the crucible of going from being ordinary animals to hyper-intelligent a self self-aware animals, but then on the way they invent tools that they aren't yet mature enough to be able to handle properly and they end up wiping themselves out.

Speaker 2:          01:53:40       Well, it's certainly possible. And if we look at the universe as being infinite, the infinite possibilities exist as well. So probably all the pitfalls, like all the things that we avoid it, like the Cuban missile crisis, maybe they didn't avoid and maybe they were wiped out and maybe they did toxify their atmosphere to the point where they didn't recover for hundreds of thousands of years and mutants and freaks barely made it by, you know, running from hybrid wolves that have fucking glowing red eyes. Who knows what has been done. Right? So what kind of genetic engineering has been done on these planets? It's been run amok and fucked everybody of the movie. Uh, we in what version of what we've done in Australia with foxes and rabbits is out of control nature experiments that have really gone all fucked up wolves in Idaho that are out of control, how much of that has been done in these other places as well as genetically modifying things to the point where it doesn't work anymore. And that's, that's also possible.

Speaker 3:          01:54:36       Absolutely. And what's sort of staggering to me is getting an insight into how recently we have invented all of this stuff and change the world like this. Like I was, I was in Athens during the great financial crisis just in the week after they had the big no vote was the week when it really looked like grace was going to crash out of the eurozone about what, four or five weeks ago. And uh, we went to the Acropolis, the Parthenon because you know, that's what you do. And I was standing there in the museum, like looking at all this stuff and I was struck not so much by how incredibly ancient it is. Like this is the birthplace of civilization, right? I mean, this is where it all began. This is the birthplace of Western civilization basically, but I was amazed at how actually comparatively recent that is.

Speaker 3:          01:55:20       Like I was saying earlier that my grandmother just died. She was a hundred. I can conceive of her lifetime. Right. I knew her like that's a long lifetime, but it's not inconceivably long as a period of time. She was born before the roaring twenties. Think of that. Yeah. She was born in Nineteen 15. She was born during the Gallipoli campaign in the first world war, but. So anyway, that's a span time that I can wrap my head around. You have 30 or 40 of those and you're back at the Acropolis, right on the banks of the birthplace of Western civilization. That is not a number. That's like the hundred billion stars in the galaxy that I can't wrap my head even begin to wrap my head around. It's not a number like the billions of years that the earth is all that I can't wrap my head around. That's a very measurable, understandable thing. The birth of Western civilization is just 30 or 40 of my grandmother's long and then think about the fact that when she was born there were no nuclear weapons, was no nuclear power. We haven't discovered any of that stuff. Right? This is so recent. We are. We have the privilege of being the generation, the couple of generations that are witnessing the, the dawn of the beginning of something extraordinarily new, a, the capacity to destroy ourselves using nukes and environmental degradation and be the rise of artificial intelligence and in computing and mobilization.

Speaker 2:          01:56:39       You look at that, the Acropolis, the parthenon was crazy. The Acropolis is the building, right and the Parthenon is

Speaker 3:          01:56:45       built on the Acropolis is the whole thing I think, and I think the Parthenon is the building. Am I getting that back to front? I'm not sure, but the.

Speaker 2:          01:56:52       The bottom line is when you talk to Greek scholars and they talk about the construction of the building on top, it was built on Samba, something that was even more ancient and they don't exactly know who built. They don't exactly know who built the platform that fucker was put on and then you go back to crazy things like Baalbek and Lebanon where they have these enormous stone things that thousands and thousands and thousands of tons and they're like, well, what the fuck bill? How'd they build these? Would they do with these where these things fucking come from? And they really don't know. And that brings up the possibility that we haven't had a linear progression from a man to this, but we've had these ups and downs and we've been at partially wiped out. There is a, there's a series of super volcanoes all over the world and one big one being in yellowstone that everyone's terrified of, but there's one of them, I believe in Indonesia that there's a certain theory that links to a massive eruption of this supervolcano 70,000 years ago. That is the reason why we all share this. Um, so little genetic diversity. And they believed that we might have been down to a few thousand people somewhere around 70,000 years ago.

Speaker 3:          01:58:05       We were down to, I mean scientists, evolutionary biologists can tell that we were down to, I don't know if it's as low as that, but certainly, I mean it was tens of thousands of people and I know when that was, but I remember you mentioned that Supervolcano last time I was on this show and then I went and googled it and it was, and it was like a probably didn't happen. Like most of the expert sites that I went and looked at was like, this is kind of one of those sort of conspiracy theory things that we don't actually think happened, but whether or not it was that particular Indonesian super volcano or not, we do know that there have been periods where humankind has, has almost gone extinct and we've just gotten through that.

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       Well, human beings have been in this form for who knows how long, you know, like a million years, whatever it's been there without a doubt has been an eruption of yellowstone in that time period. So if there were human beings in North America 600,000 years ago, those fuckers were cooked and we're do. We're done. Every six to 800,000 years, yellowstone blows and it is a continent killer, it will fuck up everything in the continent and caused some sort of a nuclear winter effect to a vast majority of the world except maybe like Australia, Australian passport. I was going to scrape back to the Homeland New Zealand, go and kill some foxes. That might be the spot to spot because there's a real but didn't have to deal with what they're doing at [inaudible] dot com. That poor bastard Kim got.com. You don't know what's going on with him with that Mega upload site and just trying to extradite him to a country that he's not even from.

Speaker 4:          01:59:34       Show him that this was a super volcanoes. Valpo is an amazing. I said what we're looking at here for people who are listening to the podcast is yellowstone and then turbo, which looks like it's in Indonesia and Tampa, which is was a mega volcanoes, so tell my uncle actually is a. is like a melody. I have maddy on my side. Yeah. Wow, that's cool. Again, those crazy face tattoos. I didn't have a tattoo on my back, which is a symbol and to tempo is, is an old extinct volcano when it blew, they will. There are writings of people in Italy talking about how the sunset is, how like the sky is red at sunset and that's because of the ash from a volcano on the opposite side of the world and is currently a crater that is so big, like it's a lake that you can reach a huge, like huge.

Speaker 4:          02:00:22       Like, and that whole thing was just a stream of lava just exploding. Like it's you can you stand on the side of the lake and you're like this. I can't even imagine what kind of Armageddon that must've been back when it was active. Well, our stability, the stability that we've enjoyed over the past several thousand years that people have written about, I mean other than, um, what was the one that happened in Rome or what was the, what was it based on pay? Yeah, the Pompei one, which was a fairly famous because we've actually found people that were killed and we could see their bodies and there's, there's an exhibit somewhere where they have the bodies of the people from palm pay, the preserved ones on display somewhere. What's supposed to be really freaky, but that, that was a major, a minor one in comparison to yellowstone. They didn't even.

Speaker 4:          02:01:14       There it is. Those are the people that were fucking frozen in time and cooked and killed by this. It's just insane. Those are actual real human beings. I mean, it looks like some claymation animated thing. That's incredible. But the um, what they believe is that, well, they didn't even know. Here's another thing they didn't even know about yellowstone until they started looking at it from satellites. They had no idea it was a Caldera volcano. They knew that there was some sort of thermal activity because of old faithful. They knew there was some lava going on under there, but they didn't know how big the thing was until they started looking at it with satellite imagery and then they realize what, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. This thing is like 600 kilometers wide and what it is is a mountain that explodes and leaves this crater and that's what it called dairy is.

Speaker 4:          02:02:06       It reaches this explosion and the whole mountain fly. You got 300 mile wide mountain shoots, lava up into the sky and just kills everything. Everything anywhere on the west coast. All this is dead. It's funny how we have a kind of. There's a sort of cognitive dissonance. It comes back to what we were talking about, about like the doors of perception and how our brains are forced by evolution and to keep us in a very narrow mindset where we don't think about the reality of what's going on around us and how vast everything is and so on. Because I think sometimes about like my friends who live in San Francisco, San Francisco is going to be devastated by a massive earthquake. It's just gonna happen when this to La.

Speaker 4:          02:02:51       San Francisco goes, they look at you. I'm Las Vegas. San Francisco goes, there's going to be awful, but oh yeah, but he's gonna go to La. Is Ballet as being no las. He's saying much San Francisco is a innovation Langley to be to be more devastated, likable, more likable, more technical, having wood's put in my mouth. I'm a paranoid paranoid or you, uh, so anyhow, at the store, that is great. That's what I felt like you were saying, but you know, we know this is going to happen and we all go about our daily lives and we don't pay any attention to it because we couldn't because we would be paralyzed if we kept thinking isn't going to be today, is it going to be tonight? Then we'd just be. I mean that's OCD, right? So we are forced to go through life not wrecking will not actually reckoning with the fact that that's going to happen and yellowstone is going to happen and all kinds of stuff's going to go down and there's not a thing we can do about it then.

Speaker 4:          02:03:47       Then there's asteroids, asteroidal impacts of the big one, the, all the evidence that they're finding now about all the different impact craters that they have ignored or not, not been aware of until recently. The discovery of what they called, I think it's called Triton nine, it's nuclear glass, that that exists on nuclear test sites and also made meteor a meteor impacts that they've founded all throughout Asia and all throughout other parts of Europe from 12,000 years ago and they think that that coincided with the end of the ice age at the end of the ice age or might have been instigated by massive astro asteroids and impacts all over the world like 12,000 years ago. That might have been why there is this really old structures that are sort of unexplained and this sort of resurgence of civilization.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       Somewhere around the 10,000 year mark that we have this big downfall. People start figuring things out again, just like if you go back 2000 years from now, you know, you're talking about Greece, you're talking about ancient Rome, and then 2000 years later you have New York City, right? Well, 2000 years after this media, real media in most terrible words. I'm using girl. I'm trying to. I'm trying to say like a weather reporter. Jet Lags triploid along flat. Yes. Asteroidal and I'm drinking now. You've had a half beer. That's all I need. New. Was this fucking Nuevo New Mexican beer? Yeah, that's good. Um, but they think that it's very possible that civilization has experienced many of these. Oh, that's what Graham Hancock is based, like a tremendous amount of his work on. I don't know if you're aware of him, but he's a good friend and he wrote a book called fingerprints of the Gods. It's based on exactly that. All this evidence that shows that their civilization has experienced these peaks and valleys and that things have happened, that there have been some resets and it hasn't been as simple as people figured out fire. Then they figured out they. And here we are today in New York City.

Speaker 3:          02:05:44       I don't know if I mentioned it last time I was on the podcast or not, but there's an amazing kind of study and there's an amazing article about this sort of research which is if society collapses and we still have nuclear waste in the ground, how do we mark our nuclear waste sites such that a future civilization who has, who's completely from us? Doesn't speak our language, has no more records of anything that went on so that they don't go and hurt themselves by digging it up, and so there's the actual there a semiotician and like all these people who study the nature of symbols and of and of conscious interpretation of the ways that we communicate and everything who have got these crazy ideas like putting up these big kind of structures that look like big scary angled polls that get deeper and deeper and thicker and thicker as you get towards the site of where the nuclear waste is being stored to try to indicate to future intelligent civilizations.

Speaker 3:          02:06:40       Not to go in there, but then the conclusion that they always reach is they're just going to think they're going to be interested in it. They're going to want to explore it. Right? It's like if even if they understood that, we're saying that there is this invisible radioactive stuff. If they haven't yet, like devise the concept of nuclear power, then they're just going to treat it the way that we treat the warnings on the pyramids saying, don't go into the mummies because they know you'll get a tech by spirits were like, oh, that was a nice fun thing for you to say you old fashioned people in ancient civilizations, but we're going to go in and open the tomb anyway, and so the conclusion was don't do anything. Just don't mock it at all. Don't try to communicate it because human curiosity is always going to be more, not even human curiosity. Maybe like whatever this future species is there, curiosity is going to be more powerful than any warning that we could possibly give them because this stuff last for tens sometimes hundreds of thousands of years.

Speaker 2:          02:07:32       Yeah, we really fucked up that whole nuclear power thing. I was trying to explain to someone who is a. he's a pretty staunch conservative and he was saying how clean nuclear power is relatively. And I said, do you understand that nuclear power has only been around since the 19 forties and we already in this brief moment of time, we already have three spots that we can never go to. They're done like, Chernobyl is done, fucked, you know, and the Fukushima is fucked. That's fucked. You know, there was the other one, the mile island, three mile island, wherever it, it was really fucked. Yeah. But that's still three spots that they fucked up already. Never to, not even to mention all the ones that are based in the same technology that Fukushima was. When they can't really shut them down. They, they, they have these archaic fucking nuclear power plants they build when they didn't really understand nuclear power plants.

Speaker 3:          02:08:28       Have you heard of pebble shell reactors or something like that? Um, pebble. Hang on, let me see if I can find. Because there is apparently a type of reactor now where if anything goes wrong, it automatically shuts down. Like it's a physiological thing. Were they having a, it's called a pebble bed reactors, a graphite moderated gas cooled nuclear reactor. It's apparently, I believe scientists when they say that there are new types of reactors that are basically meltdown proof. My concern is I just think it's so woefully irresponsible to do something that, you know, producers waste, fits incredibly deadly. That's gonna last for thousands and thousands of times longer than any of us or any of our children or any of our grandchildren or great grandchildren. It could be around and just leave it up to other people to deal with. And I hear conservatives, so a pro nuclear people say, well, we'll figure it out eventually. Okay, great. Let's not use nuclear power until we figure it out then because otherwise you just, you fucking with other people's lives.

Speaker 2:          02:09:29       People don't think like that though. They think short term and they just try to make as much money as possible. That's true. Noble today. Um, there's a great documentary that I watched on the plane back from Brazil.

Speaker 3:          02:09:39       Merchants of doubt. It was. Have you seen it? Yes. Remind me what it is. Because I think I interviewed the film

Speaker 2:          02:09:45       fucking fascinating. It is about fake experts essentially get hired by oil companies, tobacco companies to poo poo the concerns and debate them ferociously. The concerns about global warming concerns. They used to do the concerns about tobacco being or nicotine being addictive and causing cancer and this guy shows that that when when there's money involved, they. What they do is they hire all these people to fuck with the argument and they write op Ed columns and all these different newspapers all throughout the country and they constantly hammer so that your grandfather reads and he goes, I've read a thing today is at 31,000. Scientists have said that global warming's not real. We know who is amongst those 31,000 scientists, Michael J Fox. That was one of it. One of the names, they're fake. It's fake names and they have Michael Shermer on. It's kind of explaining that he's great. At one point in time he thought that there was, that it was nonsense that global warming is nonsense. And then he started delving into the, the actual data, the actual scientific papers, and then he realized, well, there's not only is there a consensus that man made global warming is a real thing, but there are no peer reviewed studies, no scientific papers that indicate the opposite. None, zero, Zilch.

Speaker 3:          02:11:04       I interviewed the director of that movie on, on huffpost live. So I did see the movie on a screen up beforehand. And um, it, the amazing thing to me was that it's not just the same tactics that are being used in sowing doubt about climate change as well. Used in sowing doubt about all kinds of other different things, you know, starting bestest, bestest, all this sort of stuff. It's the same human beings. Yes, yes. These are professional. That's why it's called merchants of doubt. These are the same human beings who went in and fought for the tobacco lobby who then went and fought for the asbestos industry who are now fighting for the fossil fuel companies. Exactly the same human beings using exactly the same playbook, using exactly the same.

Speaker 2:          02:11:43       And those, those Goddamn television shows where they have the split screen where they have the host and then they have the two experts debate it out, and then have one person who's like Bill Nye, who's sort of a reasonable scientist is saying things that people can't totally understand because they're a little bit too tactical and then you have this shouting guy who like fact 23,000 scientists from 40 countries have said global warming's not real fact. The United States and went along and the they, they have this playbook that they use. They have this style of communicating in these short bursts because those shows only last. You have seven minutes, you have seven minutes. There's three people there were all talking. It's so hard to get a point across and it. It's one of the reasons why I think it's one of the shittiest ways to discuss a subject.

Speaker 3:          02:12:32       Totally. This is one of the things that I really spend a lot of time trying to do in my job, which is overturn this phony sense of balance that is required. It's so every journalist in every media person tries to be anyone who's good has instilled in them a sense that they're supposed to be fair, right, but that often gets misallocated, especially at places like CNN, for example, where they're trying to be genuinely even handed, but what they think that means is giving a microphone to the two people at either side of any particular debate. Now there are some debates where one side is right and one side is wrong, right? Or there's a 98 percent chance that one side is right and a two percent chance that the other side is right. When you try to be balanced by just sitting in the middle and trying to moderate a debate between those two people, you're actually not being unbiased at all.

Speaker 3:          02:13:25       You're being biased towards false hood instead of towards truth. So whenever I have have a weekly segment about science news called the nerds forum on Huff Post live, and I always try to try to explain to people and express, look, this is the likelihood that this thing is actually true. So let's talk about the science and let's not get caught up in this trap of false equivalencies. It's like, where did you say a call? Bam. Did a bit about. No, it wasn't cold. Barrows. John Oliver did a bit. And the same guy. Same Guy. John Oliver is a different guy. Does he have an English accent? He has an English accent, new character. The Colbert. Stephen Colbert is a human being. So John, although he's not anymore, he's the host of the late show. Oh right. Kobe is no more carry on. So John Oliver did this bit where he was like a.

Speaker 3:          02:14:18       instead of having a pro climate change person and an anti climate change person, uh, we think that we should actually reflect the proportions accurately since 99 percent of climate scientists believe in it. They have one. So he brings out nine. Nine people come on sand and they're all just shouting, oh, actually pro the pro climate change position. And there's this one other guy who's chatting the etsy climate change position. And he's like, this is what it actually is like. It's not one for one, it's $99 for one, and that's how the media should portray. That's hilarious. That's a great idea. By the way, there really is a great idea. Idea.

Speaker 2:          02:14:53       Yeah. I think that those shows are horrible because they're. This is how a lot of people get their information and they say they call it the news in quotes, but it's not really the news. It's an entertainment show and it's an entertainment show that relies on commercials, so you this balanced nuanced perspectives and arguments that are extremely complex like we like we spent all this time talking about the conservation for hunting argument and all the artificial intelligence argument, the argument, the argument about pursuing it. All these things are real complex, nuanced issues that require long sort of detailed examinations of all the possibilities and not from a biased perspective but from as objective as is humanly possible, especially when there's real ramifications. Things like global warming or nuclear energy or things that really are gonna fuck up our generation and generations to come like the hundreds of thousands of years from now.

Speaker 2:          02:15:51       Those don't get addressed when you have seven minutes and you have a guy who's being paid by these think tanks and that's what's crazy about this merchants of doubt, a documentary is it shows that there's these people that are paid by think tanks and these think tanks. What they really are is they're these fake organizations that are propped up by companies that are selling whatever the fuck they would benefit from this being passed or this being the. The concerns being alleviated. One of them being like this doctor who was a paid by this think tank to go and preach about these flame retardant fabrics and materials using to make furniture and that he would say this story about a woman who left a candle in the babies was a cigarette, wasn't a candle. She said a candle. She left it. There was a cigarette story too, but there's a woman left a candle in her baby's crib and that the baby, because the pillow was flame retardant leaves a candle in a baby's crib annually.

Speaker 2:          02:16:53       Exactly. It wasn't a real story. It was a lie and this guy had told not that story, not just once, but several times over a long period of time, over many years, and these people started investigating the merchants of doubt. Go Watch the documentary. It's amazing. Amazing. And they started investigating this doctor and what did they call them up? Did you actually treat these people? They looked into his past. His background is passed. They did a computer database on all the infants that died from burns in this guy's a area and they found that it was a lie and so they called him and he said, well, this is an anecdotal thing and I would trust it wasn't real. I was just trying to paint a story of what's possible. No you fucking, but he, because he wasn't under oath because he wasn't under oath when he was testifying.

Speaker 2:          02:17:37       He was allowed to lie about this stuff. When they asked him, yeah, I was paid for citizens for fire safety or whatever the fuck that's the think tank was. And then when a think tank has less than x amount of members, you have to sort of disclose where the funding comes from and the funding all came from the manufacturers of this flame retardants shit that is causing all sorts of problems with children, especially babies like babies around this flame retardants stuff that dust from that stuff gets in their lungs that gets in their system and they showed like the difference between the amount of this shit, it's an American babies versus the amount of the shit that's in babies and other countries where they don't have these people lobbying to have the shit be put in there. Their furniture. It's fucking terrifying.

Speaker 3:          02:18:17       I often wonder living in America why cancer rights here are increasing at the, at the right that they are. And you know why Fox News, because you can answer this Washington. I mean not those hot chicks or something is going on right up. That is not happening in Japan and it is not happening in, in other countries. And I wonder whether it is stuffed like industry's lobbying for fire safety. Things that are. So every time you sit down on your couch, you just a little bit, you're just absorbing like the tiniest, tiniest, tiniest little bit of some shitty chemical, you know, I don't want to get too hippy dippy about it, but like all the stuff that's in our soaps and the teenager just the, um, the number, you look at the ingredients on things and they were just, it's just a litany of chemicals. It makes me, it makes me want to move to New Zealand and ate my, My, my grandmother's beautiful eggs from a natural chicken and just use eucalyptus oil to bathe myself in and sit on a wooden chair.

Speaker 2:          02:19:11       Well, I think you're right. And I think though the argument is pretty clear when you see things like this merchants of doubt and you find out how lobbyists work and you find out how think tanks work and you find out how these people are actively trying to get these things, get the concerns about these things that alleviated. And they're it strictly for financial reasons. That's it. They're not doing it because they have a real concern. And it takes us a while before we figure it out, like thalidomide, like thumb, a little bit of my babies. And that has to happen as best as people have to get cancer, they get rid of. Especially now they're getting rid of trans fats. Trans fats are now illegal. Well, how many fucking people had to get sick? I mean, how long have trans fats and margarine? I can't believe it's not butter. How long has that shift been around? It's been around forever and people have lobbied in, lied and promoted these things for their own personal gain and profits. And it's, it's crazy. But it's a real part of our culture. It's a real part of our legal system. It's a real part of how we, we, we, you know, we create laws. It's, it's kind of scary. It's kind of scary when you think about how sociopathic it really is.

Speaker 3:          02:20:13       That's right. And I do think that the, again, coming back to the media, I think we have a big responsibility because we own the media. You will realize I wasn't, I didn't mean to include you in the way I was including nervous was including me. I mean you are. You're part of the good part of the media in so far as what the Internet is now doing is allowing conversations like this. Like you say, well, how can you get to impart these ideas in seven minutes? I mean, you're lucky if you get seven minutes on exhibit TV, you usually get three minutes. If you're on the today show, you get three minutes or something, but how many people have time to listen to a three hour podcast at one point 6 million twitter followers?

Speaker 2:          02:20:46       Yeah, there's a lot now. It's getting more now, but it's also ridiculous that a former fear factor host meatheads cage fighting commentators smokes pot all the time, is the guy that you come into for information. It seems like there should be someone more qualified.

Speaker 3:          02:21:01       Well, that's right. That's right. But I mean when there are like Sam Harris and there's a lot more people out there that are doing this as well, but this medium, I agree with you that this medium absolutely genius of it, and the problem is that people, journalists, and not don't tend to be scientifically literate. So when something comes out saying that butter is a deadly killer and monitoring is the answer, then someone puts out a press release, a PR company, then some money from it, from the modern industry, and then the producer at the radio station or television station who receives that knows that that's a juicy tidbit. So they write it up and they do a story on it and that's that all of a sudden the viewer is under the impression that this is a settled fact. It's not a settled fact. It's what was one study and in three years' time module is going to be a deadly killer and bought is going to be good again. But also in the

Speaker 2:          02:21:47       defense of the people that were distributing that information, there was very little known about cholesterol back then. LDL, cholesterol, hdl, cholesterol. What is the difference? What was needed? Scientific work has still been needed to be done on a lot of different dietary supplements and things that the data wasn't in yet.

Speaker 3:          02:22:03       Right, but Joe, scientists will always speak with more caveats than the media does. Huge bug and scientists back then, even if they hadn't known about ldl cholesterol, they would've said, look on the basis of what we currently understand about module and bought a and human physiology, blahdy, blahdy, blah. That's not the way that it ends up getting impounded because nobody wants to watch a television show that equivocates like that or a news broadcast that equivocates like, no, I think

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       you're definitely right about that and I also think that we're in a weird time now where, because of the Internet and because like you could do huffpost live, I don't know what kind of editorial control they have over what you do. Like when you finish. I really enjoy your show, by the way, if anybody hasn't seen it, the reason why I wanted to get you on the show in the first place, I've watched many episodes your show and it's very balanced and until I like this conversation, it's a, it's a cool show and it's, and it's very unlike something that you would see in normal NBC 8:00 PM or whatever the fuck it would be on broadcast television. It's just very different. I think that that kind of stuff and that the Internet and what the Internet, the freedom that it provides and also the freedom of Info, the amount of information, the access to it is kind of changing the, the ability of these people to do things like that.

Speaker 3:          02:23:12       Yeah, I agree. Um, did you say, by the way, this also just popped into my head while we were talking. Um, Richard Dawkins tweet about feminism in Islam. Nobody saw him. He said, uh, Islam needs a feminist revolution. It will be hard. What can we do to help and which seems reasonable to me. Yeah. And then, uh, the Internet just exploded. I had I store, it feels like they got mad at him. Oh, totally misogynistic. How dare he has a white male. Look, I have these. I still have these tabs up on my computer because we were looking at it as a white male.

Speaker 2:          02:23:52       Women who are forced to wear these crazy outfits. They cover their body. They can't go to school. They can't drive.

Speaker 3:          02:23:59       So look at the candidate vote ugliest headlines. Richard Dawkins, mansplained feminism to Muslim women. Atheist Richard Dawkins, tweet file. Richard Dawkins fail spectacularly on feminism and Islam. Who wrote these, by the way, they're all over the place. Uh, one of them's Napoleon pace in the huff post. One of them said, yeah, we made a blog. What is the opinion blog? What does it say? That is the. Hang on, let me see if I was told that. I think I, I just saved the titles here. Say so I don't have the uh, there are so many people looking to call bullshit on men that somehow or another

Speaker 2:          02:24:37       try to say anything about what women do or need to do.

Speaker 3:          02:24:42       Like here's one twitter user says, Richard Dawkins needs to abandon his patronizing white savior, paternalist, Islamophobia like how many buzzwords can you fit in a tweet? How many politically correct buzzwords can you fit? That person's not real. That's a Stephen Colbert, Huffington post. They're pretending to be a fucking liberal conservative, and then, and then it was an article saying that he's no better than early 20th century European colonists, Muslim women, that they needed help from European men even says, what can we do to help? It says, Islam needs a feminist revolution. It will be hard. What can we do to help?

Speaker 2:          02:25:20       That's a beautiful tweet and it's correct when look, if you just look at it as human, forget about Islam. Forget about sex is. Forget about all that gender's shit. If you just looked at it, there's a human being that's looking at other human beings that are forced to behave in a way that they might not want to picture. It has nothing to do with this. Let's say it's a new group that starts up tomorrow and they call themselves the fucking monkey faces.

Speaker 3:          02:25:44       Joe, you're ignoring the deep complexity of so many different strains of Islam around the world. You're disempowering women of color, western world. What about white chicks that are Muslim?

Speaker 2:          02:25:54       You're, you're a racist. I just called you out and you don't call out fucking racist. There's a lot of white Muslim. Of course. I'm just so frustrating with. Was sarcastic too. I know. What can you do? How can we do it? Here are people that are trying to call bullshit on people when the bullshit doesn't exist because they want a score just like we were talking about earlier, that cops want to arrest people because it's a fucking game and they want to win. I think there's people that want to win on twitter. There's people that want to win on huff post is people that are looking to write blogs about a guy like Richard Dawkins who has said some kind of weird, questionable shit in the past. Like especially the shit that he said about child molesting that he was, uh, he experienced some mild molestation when he was young. No big deal. Got over it. You know, like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. What the fuck,

Speaker 3:          02:26:41       man, if you listen to what he was actually saying, I think what he was, I think what he was saying is get over that we get, we get, we have certain paradigms of about which we get very, very upset and because abusing and violently raping children is pretty much the worst thing that you can possibly do. We have made it mandatory to regard all child abuse as being the worst thing that can possibly happen. I think his point was like I was funneled by by a stupid crazy priest when I was 12 years old or something and I pretty quickly got over it. So that's not to say that other people who didn't get over it and going through didn't go through horrible things, but do we have to regard every single instance of every single type of crime as equally bad? Can we be a bit more nuance? Like maybe they're a very, very bad forms of child abuse and maybe there are less bad forms of child abuse, but the moment you say that, everyone says he's saying a child abuse is good.

Speaker 2:          02:27:35       Right? Well, and also this is a horrible thing to say, but I'll preface it by saying, this is my own personal experience. I was bullied when I was a kid, but it was mild bullying, like nobody did anything horrible to me. I was never beaten half to death or I was never. Nobody ever threatened me with weapons. I just kind of picked on and fucked with, but it got me into martial arts and it changed my life. Like these are the Yin and the Yang to things and I think that sometimes take a little bit of resistance is good because the reaction to that resistance is you decide like, this is never going to happen to me anymore. I'm going to fire up and I'm going to figure out a way to empower myself. So this is no longer a fear of mine and I think that a little bit of someone being an asshole to you makes you appreciate kind people.

Speaker 2:          02:28:24       I think the, the evil people in the world. And here's another one. Shitty relationships. I think most of us have had some bad relationships, bad relationships make you appreciate good relationships. You know, like I, I really appreciate one of the things I really love about my wife, she doesn't like to argue about shit. She's like a really kind person. She's friendly and sweet and warm and she's not like a person like picks on people and she like picks on you or starts arguing or brings up shit that happened like a month ago or a year ago. I have a buddy that has a wife that argues with them like that. Well, yeah. Well you know, when we were first dating you, he's like, that was fucking police fucking selling. My body is different from the cells that were in my body seven years ago. I'm not responsible for that guy who came home drunk and fucking shit already apologized.

Speaker 2:          02:29:12       Exactly. But it's not. If anything comes up, like if she does something wrong, like if she doesn't pay a bill. So was put the fuck the cables off. Well you remember when we first started dating and fucking yes, I do remember that. And it also has nothing whatsoever to do with the conversation that we're having right now. Well, you, when you experienced that, he fucked up and married this crazy broad. Sorry, I said broad. I'm an asshole. Let me try to explain things. It was white male privilege or ripping into the microphone. I split. I spray that shit like come. That's what I do with my white male privilege. I don't allow it to just ooze out like maple syrup. Um, I think that when we see these terrible things like when I go to, I love Brazil. Brazil is a wonderful country. It's a, the people are friendly, they're free, they're happy, but it's also like kind of crazy unorganized.

Speaker 2:          02:30:03       Like when you go to the airport, like one of the things when we were getting on a plane from Sao Paulo to Brazil or Sao Paulo to Rio rather, um, the, we couldn't find out what fucking gate it was because they said 17. See? So we'd go to 17 c and the lady, uh, you know, she speaks Portuguese. So she's like, no, no, no, day 24, 20 5:00 AM I, but it doesn't say 24 slash slash eight. So we go to 24 and 24 says floor Annapolis and it says another one next to it, like what the fuck? But they were saying it over the loudspeaker. So all the people that are listening that spoke Portuguese knew that it was, but there was no signs because there are. It's a different world. They have a different. So it made me appreciate when you come back to America, you look up at the fucking departures.

Speaker 2:          02:30:46       Oh there's the gate. Here we go. You know what, if you only spoke mandarin, the true, it'd be fucked. You'd be fucked. We fucking just a bad hit. Even worse because if I spoke mandarin and I was in Brazil, I'd be double. Fuck you. You didn't even read what the fuck they're writing and they couldn't know what the hell you know, you would go to your app on your phone and try to decipher it. But point being like when when you see something like if you like, if you go to like my buddy who went to Africa and experienced like all the chaos of Africa said God mean people complain about America like you to go, yes, of course

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       it's not perfect. There is no utopia on this planet who is Denmark Utopia. I mean it's just like, I think there were degrees, right? Like obviously Africa and many South American countries are going to be more screwed up then rich countries like America. Right? But then within the club of rich countries, there are also countries where shit just works. It just easy stuff is easy. I lived in Copenhagen for a semester and went to university there in my early twenties and like, you know, there's no lines at the post office. There's no, I mean granted there's no people who live there. There's like 14 people in the whole country. But like it's still scalable. You could actually have. They still got a tax, the same tax base per capita, you know, as America could have if it wanted to have higher taxes and you could actually have a dmv that that works and you could have a post office that functions.

Speaker 3:          02:32:07       We don't have to wait around all the time. It's just A. There's certainly societies that, you know, Thomas Friedman says that flying from Schiphol airport in Amsterdam into JFK is like flying from the, from the jetsons to the Flintstones, like laguardia is a shit hole. Then that's just the way it is. You know, there are countries whose airports are nice and who's trains of fast and these healthcare systems work more cheaply. The worst though, the way the people treat you at Laguardia, there is so fucking over it and aggressively over it, like Shitty to you. Oh, New York Tsa workers are my least favorite of all the TSA workers. That's pretty bad. So he asked them a question, now that I've, now that I've got, I've got to tell you, you're lucky that you have global entry. Need to get it. You gotta get it. I'm a fucking idiot.

Speaker 3:          02:33:02       I mean, [inaudible] damn it, I just got my green card, this, I got my green card earlier this year and done to our country. So thank you very much. I hope you enjoy it. I appreciate it. I've been in 10 years, but uh, you know, just on temporary visas and uh, now that I was able to get global entry, just not having to deal with the customs officials coming in, especially in the foreign as lane. I mean I imagine it may be better in the city and the citizens lane, but coming in and the foreign is lane where you're in front of like they've just had to deal with 478. Like people who don't speak English who are probably coming in with with some lousy shit from abroad or chicken in their back. Yeah, that's right. Exactly.

Speaker 3:          02:33:45       In the backpack there no speak. Oh, how racist. Josh zaps racist evolution. It did not. So he start tweeting. Can we do to help asshole? I can't believe what he just did a. and so by the time I get, I get up to the, to the customs guy, that pissed, they're over it, they're over me wherever, everything. So just being able to go to the kiosk and swept the global entry and then just walk straight through. It's one of the greatest things. All the guys I work with the UFC habit. I'm the only one who doesn't. I'm fucking moron. It's not hard. Just busy, bro. I'm doing a lot of podcasts and shit.

Speaker 2:          02:34:18       You are not a hard. You make an appointment. I go to cryotherapy five times a week. I can't go to global entry apartment. I'm. Yeah. You should not do it. Should I agree with you? I'm disappointed in myself as well. He should be. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:34:35       Is I wonder whether or not just on why people are angry at Richard Dawkins for saying something that obviously makes sense.

Speaker 2:          02:34:41       I think they're not really angry. I don't believe they are angry. I don't. You feel like

Speaker 3:          02:34:46       some people see the world in groups and identities and for them identity politics is the most important way of contextualizing and conceiving of the things that are happening around them in culture. So the moment a person who's a white male starts saying anything, they're like, okay, this is in the category of patronizing white male authority. Looking down on this other category of person who is oppressed like religious minority. So let's not actually listen to what's being said and let's not give anyone the benefit of the doubt. Let's just super impose that into the jigsaw puzzle in my brain, which is like culture. And when you say it also in, in all of the, all of the racial problems that have been happening in the past year in the United States. And I'm totally on the side of the black lives matter movement here. And I have a huge problem with, uh, with the brutality that police show towards towards minority communities. But you got to make sure that you're actually talking on the same page about the ideas and the practices that you're not just caricaturing people into stereotypes of one another. Right. And I think maybe that's what's happening here.

Speaker 2:          02:35:53       I agree. It might be. I think that what's going on is like a game of hungry, hungry hippo and there's a little marble and they see that you can snatch that marble and they go for it. I think it's an opening and I don't think it's logical and you know what I love, I love when people who have these knee jerk reactions to these things, like they see these openings and they'd go for it because they feel like there's an opening to attack also get attacked. Like there's a woman who wrote a piece, she's a feminist and she wrote a piece about my friend Amy Schumer who is hilarious and wild and just fucking awesome. And she's kicking ass right now and she's in the cover of a magazine sucking on [inaudible] finger. And there were saying why this magazine is so awful about, you know, against feminism.

Speaker 2:          02:36:35       And I was like, shit, what the fuck are you like, this is an antifeminist thing. And she shouldn't be sucking fingers. Like, as if like you're a woman, you can't be sexual, you know, like isn't it like part of being a person who owns themselves owning all the things you enjoy? Maybe she likes sucking fingers, you know, like she's a fucking picture of it. That's fun. Bad ass bitch. Look at her. She's so good. I love her. I love her. She's gangster as fuck. But here's the thing. This same woman wrote a bit of, she wrote another piece because I like to follow knuckleheads showed another piece about how she's getting older and it's really kind of. She's torn because she doesn't get cat called much anymore.

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       She's actually getting. She's actually as conflicting opinions about this. And so here's the tweet that drove me crazy. It made me laugh. I howled at my own computer. Someone tweeted her saying that this article about being conflicted about not being catcalled anymore. I felt like that was a very white cis piece. White, cisgender, meaning that people of Color and trans people have to worry about being catcalled because trans people, if their cat called and then someone finds out that the trans, they can get beaten to death and you should be more aware that when you write these pieces, you're insensitive and true. She could. She had a. She had a. She had to acquiesce. She had to like give into it because she's a part of that fucking retarded culture. Right. So she got stuck in our own bullshit ideology is the caveat. Trans Women in particular, but trans people in general are the victims of violence that way.

Speaker 1:          02:38:12       Higher rates than everybody else. So let's just put that aside and say that that's a terrible thing and that we should still be supportive of the Trans community, but I mean, did you, you heard about it was a college that canceled the vagina monologues because they were doing a production of the vagina monologues, this popular feminist play. Yes. Yes. The trend and the and the on campus trends community, not even the on campus trans community. There wasn't an on campus trans community. The the on campus like liberal fucking knee jerk douchebag decided it was insensitive to trans to trans people because not all women have vaginas.

Speaker 1:          02:38:48       Someone when that Dick's. Yeah, and not all people are people. My dog has a person. My dog identifies as a person. I don't know if you know that. I didn't know that. Well, you be. Be more respectful and sensitive because not all. Not all dogs are actually. Human beings are. Not all people are human beings, but I didn't. I didn't follow that big live in fucking fairy tale land. That's what we are. It's too easy to get food. That's what's going on, so people make up shit to get upset about it. That's my feeling. It's too easy to just go to the supermarket and pick up fucking cereal. It's just too easy. Here's the thing, how you actually supposed to help people. How are we supposed to be kind and considerate and generous. Every time we try to we get shut down because we put our foot in it.

Speaker 1:          02:39:29       Like Dawkins. Dawkins in that tweet about Islam is trying to support women. Yes. Like what could be wrong with that? He tries to do that and then feminist jumped down his throat for being condescending towards women because Muslim women should be the ones who were sticking up for Muslim women. They don't need your white, patriarchal, Islamaphobic male, a activity to in order to do so because they are proud and bold Muslim women. Well, not all of them are. Some of them are in stuck in beekeepers outfits in Saudi Arabia. So how do we help them if every time we try to help, we get jumped. We jumped on. Well, I think we have to negate the opinions of those people that write these posts for like the huff post, write these articles. We have to negate them by mocking them because I think it is hilariously stupid. I think that that opinion is a fucking hilariously

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       stupid that he doesn't have the right to say that he has concern for people that are a different gender than him that have a different ideology than him. They'd live in a different part of the world and him that have more melanin in their skin. That's ridiculous. And I think what we're doing here by mocking that is really what the correct response is. The only correct response. You're not going to get that response from the news. You're not going to get that from the president, but didn't you get that from people that don't have a vested interest in supporting one particular tribe. And I think that's one of the things that they talked about in this merchants of doubt documentary that I have really resonated with me, is that a lot of times when people talk about global warming or they talk about fucking chem trails or any of these things, there is a tribe of people that have subscribed to that ideology and it's very important that you support that tribe. And it might. It can it. It manifests itself as in ridiculous places like the tribe of people that are like android phones. They love android phones and they hate iphones. I have a friend who fucking hate. She's. She's brilliant. She's a brilliant director. She writes movies. She's fucking great. She hates Mac. I hate Mac. Everybody uses Mac. I won't fucking use apple. I use windows. I'm like, what are you talking about, Patty Gimme a hug. It's Goddamn computer. Don't get viruses. The other ones do.

Speaker 3:          02:41:29       You're such a powerful individual for not being a Mac person. Right. It's like taking your. Yeah, your rebelliousness by going with the world's largest computer company.

Speaker 2:          02:41:38       She knows. It's ridiculous. She laughs when I make fun of it, but she just fucking sticks to her guns. She fucking digs their heels in the ground. What about going? Wraps are risks around a cord. I'm not going anywhere. Madness.

Speaker 3:          02:41:51       Those people who when a new product comes out and it's usually an apple product, they'll go out and they'll camp for four or five days in order to be the first person who gets the light. I do not under. It reminded me a little bit of when you were talking about your buddy who did the massive mess of marathon, but then came in fourth. I always like I was watching, I was watching the today show or something where they were interviewing the people who were standing in line and they'd been there. You know, they've all got. They've got tents and they got sleeping bags like they were on fifth avenue, like near Central Park and they're sleeping on the sleeping, camping for 72 hours and they were and the correspondent was talking to someone who was like the seventh in line or something and I was like, yeah, I can understand spending a week outside in to get the new iphone if you're number one thing, number seven, even better than being like number 342. What differences. Oh, I got the seventh iphone.

Speaker 2:          02:42:45       He's in the middle. Like. Do you think that that's what what, what is, what is it about people that are going to get something that doesn't even do anything different? Yeah, like the smartest person I know is this woman, Dr Rhonda Patrick. She does my podcast, all podcasts all the time. She's absolutely brilliant. She has an iphone four. Right? It's an old piece of shit. It's the size of my thumbnail.

Speaker 3:          02:43:05       It doesn't even like run, run, run. And I like. There's so many apps, like even now until I recently didn't have any space on

Speaker 1:          02:43:12       my phone to five, she's smarter than me. I got a big fucking stupid six. There you go. That's the new thing is the new thing one, one generation back. You know, I didn't even realize there was a six. Wow, you're amazing. I'm like that. That's how cool I am. The type of individual I am Joe. I'm like, I'm so like totes out of like the whole like keep up with the Jones' Gizmodo.com. Live in Brooklyn and eat Kale. Kale is even better because they don't grow Kale in Brooklyn. We have it flown in from Brazil.

Speaker 1:          02:43:46       So this, I didn't have any room on my phone to upgrade to the latest software. So for ages I was still running the on the older software and gradually your apps just stop working. Like stuff just doesn't even work. Like you open up the American Airlines APP and it's like this is no longer supported by this software. So they keep you up, they keep you on your toes. I still have an older software to have the newest software because I don't have a new software on my computer either. I heard fucking crashes. Um, I wait a long time. Man may take some time. There's A. I was to be in a plastic surgeon in Australia about penile enlargement surgery. Done. Ask. Is it work? Is that done at the end? I have, but um, yeah, but they're a bit. It has some side effects. What's the side effects? Your Dick flips around in weird ways when it.

Speaker 1:          02:44:34       That's when they cut the tendon. Yeah. That's not so it doesn't religion. If you have a micro Dick, what? You're going to get an extra inch. Woah. Congratulations. Now you have two inches. It's mostly just for vain people. It's not for micro Dick People, but then also they can take fat out of, out of other parts of your body and then they'll put fat in around the edges, but thins fat and smushy. No one wants that. Anyway, my point is simply this, I wasn't intending to talk about do a little Dick. Dude's getting getting bigger dicks asteroids. He said that there's a maximum in in medicine that you should never be either the first nor the last to adopt a new procedure. Hmm. That's a good smart. That's my way towards on phones. I have my philosophy on technology on the basis of penile enlargement surgery.

Speaker 1:          02:45:15       Well, I wait a little while, but I'm not the last person to adopt, but I'm probably like third. I'm like in the third wave. I'm not enough. I'm not waiting in line for shit. I'll tell you that right now. I'm not waiting in line for a fucking phone. It's never ran out the kinks anyway. Unless the phone does like holograms. Once you put the phone down, help me Obi wan. You're my only hope like Amy Schumer pops up and fucking dances for you. Then then I'll take it. When that happens, you're going to then realized that there you go. You'll be one of the first adopters and then they'll realize it gives you. It's radioactive and it gives you cancer and you'll die. God Damn it. Turn your smartphone into a three d hologram. Is this real? Oh my God. So piece of glass. You stick on your on top of your thigh. Just tell us here. That just popped in my head. Why it makes a little hologram on your smart phone. Seriously, using glass. Well, we're really close to these new goggles that they're creating where even right now

Speaker 4:          02:46:09       they look like ski goggles, but eventually they're going to be like, like sunglasses that are the new desktop. That is incredible. Look at that. That's amazing. That's cool. What does that magic leap? What does that, that technology. Was it called magic leap? They're going to have that technology, which is also like a Hologram that you can hold in your hand. I don't know exactly how that works, but there's another version of it that. Is it just being fired out of your phone or what? Or out of a laptop. They're being very secretive about it and they've shown some demonstrations of it, but only the demonstration in the fact that you can see like there's a little girl that's watching a ballerina on her bed dancing around the ballerina. It's like four inches high. It's incredible. It looks amazing. It looks like this, like this is magic leap.

Speaker 4:          02:46:50       They don't explain it, but that's going to be this. Not Cgi. It's not a real. No, no, no, no. It's not CGI. We're looking at a little. We're looking at a little tiny total in the palm of someone's hand with a tinier puppy. Like, look at this. There's somehow they're going to be able to broadcast holograms and it's not done yet. This is like some technology that's proof of concept and it's in the middle of being developed, but then there's another one that's similar but different. What was the one that Google one with the goggles. Jamie, do you remember that one? Microsoft Hollow Lens. That's it. Yeah. Sorry. I'm in. The Hollow Lens is going to be able to change a room into a desktop. Say like a video game that you're playing, like say if you want to play like call of duty. He play call of duty in an empty room and the whole room will be the desktop.

Speaker 4:          02:47:36       I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. They have. Did they have demonstrations of that and they have like, like minority report that will you scroll and you. You'll be able to spin cubes around the air and hold them and Muslim like, look at this. This is real. This is how they're gonna. Be able to do it. This is going to be, you need to be aware of these. You're going to be spread, pinch, walk around your house. These fucking right now, they're goofy. They're these giant, huge ski goggles. So exciting when you get, when you're actually going to be able to have three dimensional interactivity with computer generated images. I mean, it's fairly inevitable if you think about, look at this, like how she's there, she's already have something like this. There's a virtual reality program that architects can use where they can walk through the house before it's been built based on their designs and they can be.

Speaker 4:          02:48:23       Yeah. And they can, they can do stuff like this where they can be like, alright, let's just extend this wool by another three inches and see what that looks like. And then they can actually take people who are prospective buyers of properties on three dimensional virtual reality tours of the house that isn't even built yet. Look at this. This is showing an instructional from how to put together a pipe on a, um, a piece of plumbing and under your sink and it's showing like the, the actual applications where you could use something for instructional purposes. So it's just amazing. And this is, this is almost inevitable, just as crazy as what we were talking about before. We could send videos to other parts of the world and skype instantaneously. All this stuff is just next level stuff. It's probably not that far off as well.

Speaker 4:          02:49:06       This isn't like in the future. This is the kind of stuff that we're going to be using and dealing with probably an in 10 years. Look at what he just showed that was, um, that was a three d, virtual reality version of the, of the surface of Mars backup a little bit more. Jamie like, look at this. That's real too. They're going to be able to send one of these rovers to Mars. You're gonna. Be able to walk around on Mars and see it as if it's really right there. I'll tell you what will be a game changer for virtual reality and three dimensional stuff like this will be pulling be a game that when when you get a virtual reality headset and some kind of like suit device that allows people to feel, feel, feel, touches on actually some kind of like, I don't know, you know, I messed up patient thing or they already on you then then get linked up to a virtual reality that actually looks not like a three d robot human, but kind of like an actual plausible human being that is going to make so much money.

Speaker 4:          02:50:02       Yes. Yeah. Well it's already. It's already happened. They already have that. What does that technology called again? The one that Duncan's always ready to. Oculus rift, they put the goggles on. They have for first person interactive porn where you put your Dick into a machine and the machine sort of strokes your deck and you're having sex with someone in first person. Yeah, they already have it. It's crazy. Not only that, it coincides. The movements coincide to a computer program that coincides with the action that you're seeing. That's what you'd want it to actually feel. I mean, the advances that are coming in, all of that kind of stuff in the next decade is going to be mind boggling. Well, I think that goes back to what we're talking about about future civilizations that do these civilizations that exist out there in the cosmos, they have radar or are they transcended that and they have.

Speaker 4:          02:50:48       They gone into virtual because I think once, once we realized that virtual can be Avatar, we can live inside some fantastic world. It's so much more rewarding and exciting and why bother with the regular carbon based life world? Why do we need everything to be real? Why? Why? Because I can knock on this table. Why is this table better than a table that I feel like I can knock on, but it's way better and every time I touch it it gives me love. Well this is the problem that's raised by the film. The Matrix, isn't it? I mean it become sort of a punchline of light blue pill, red pill, but it's actually a profound philosophical question. Would you rather, you know, do what the bad guy does in the matrix when he sells them all out and decides that he's going to go back into the matrix and have his, his memory of the Matrix, it'd be a raised and he'll live like the life of a road rich celebrity, or do you prefer the tragedy of reality knowing that it's actually true, but then what does it mean to say that reality is actually true or true, uh, than a matrix would.

Speaker 4:          02:51:44       Right? And why does it have to be? Why does, why does everything that's real have to be real in only the way we understand it today. It's just as we've come accustomed to, and even our own real of today has become very bizarre. Like the real money, the real of money used to be. You had a leather sack filled with gold coins and you carry that around. Someone could steal it from you. Now

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       it's bitcoin and it's on your phone and it's just digits, digits that have no relationship to anything. It's preparing us for this inevitable artificial weird world of something that we have. And it's not even artificial, it's just a new level of life. It's a new thing. I think that's a really good point to point out that it's not artificial because look at what we're doing right now. We're having a conversation which is going through technology that half century ago would have been inconceivable, which is being viewed by people who are watching us in real time and also listened to by people who were carrying around devices in their pockets who are able to listen to us at any point in time after the fact and those devices would have been unimaginable a few decades ago. And yet what we're actually doing is as authentic and as old as time. Which is what happened to conversation.

Speaker 1:          02:52:52       Absolutely. And we're having a conversation that's fueled by this digital interface that we have in front of us that's allowing us to, in real time get information in a way that was never possible just a couple of decades ago. We can get all this information and what was that? Jamie? Boom. He pulls it up. We see it up on the big screens. I mean, we're living right now in the matrix. We're living in like a baby matrix. Do you think it matters though? I mean I have visions of like people who just spend all their days in the, in their basements, plugged into a virtual reality machine. We'd like a drip in there. I'm providing them with sustenance and just are off in this other universe of their own. How is that then people that are listening to this while they're playing video games and drinking mountain dew, I mean the idea that you have to live in the real world in order to be valid, like why?

Speaker 1:          02:53:40       Well, I mean the only reason why is because we have needs. We have needs for companionship and love and friendship and it's good to go outside and smell the fresh air, but when they figured out a way to make oculus rift, you put on a headset and it's way better than regular fresh air. I think you're onto something with companionship. I think that gets to the nub of my concern about it, that as long as that person who's laying in their basement plugged into an ivy and living in a virtual reality world is interacting with actual other human beings who were also in that virtual world. I have less of a problem with it, but if he's interacting with avatars who aren't actual human beings but who give him all of the feedback that we need from companionship and he's living in a fake world where there is no reciprocation, like I'm pretty confident that you actually have a consciousness.

Speaker 1:          02:54:24       You might be a robot, but I'm pretty confident that what we're doing in your imagination. Yeah. You might be. He might be dreaming right now. Yes, but I'm pretty confident that you are a human being and that you are actually at that. I am currently engaged in an actual conscious exchange. Whereas if you are an Avatar and I was in virtual reality, I think that would be a loss. What? You know the concept of simulation theory, I'm sure. Right? Yeah. The concept being for those are not aware of it, is that one day we were going to not wait because I'm dumb, but someone way smarter than us. He's going to figure out a way to create this sort of oculus rift thing, next level stuff that we're discussing right now to a point where it's you can't

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       tell the difference between this and reality. It is inevitable. They're going to eventually figure it out. Just like the stuff that we're looking at right now is sort of the beginning stages of this inevitable technology that's going to transform via whatever, whatever mode that they figured out how to do and you're going to be able to have an artificial reality. It's indistinguishable from reality that we currently experience. If that's the case, how do we know that we haven't already gotten there and why would they tell you? Why would you not? I mean if, if you are in a virtual reality, if you are in an artificial, simulated version of the world we live in and it's so good, you can't distinguish, how do you know that it's not already happening? How do you know what's going on right now? You don't,

Speaker 3:          02:55:46       and there's one mode of strand of logical argument in that philosophy which says that big, we're probably likely to invent that kind of technology and a fairly fairly early in the evolution of our, of the human rights of our civilization. If you think about the dinosaurs, having lived for hundreds of millions of years, we've only been around for a few hundred thousand or something, then we're probably going to get to that point really soon. Then this argument says it's very, very likely that we actually are in the simulation already because we've got hundreds of millions of years in the simulation and only maybe 100,000 years, not in the simulation at the very, very dawn of our species. So odds are we're probably already in it, which I don't really buy, but I think as acute argument, so

Speaker 2:          02:56:28       con that ladies and gentlemen, that's the end of the podcast. Thank you very much josh. You're awesome. And like I said, it's very few people that I would do a podcast immediately after landing from Brazil, but I always enjoy our conversations, checkout way the people live, WTP, [inaudible] dot com. It's a good podcast. And twitter is WTP school alive or just send us an email and Paul Graham. Then a dollar sign, WTP, underscore live at twitter and huff post live. Awesome. Show and thank you. We can do a thousand of these when I, if I moved to La, we'll just do it every week. Are you thinking about it? It's possible. Move motherfucker. All Right Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back. We'll be back soon. I forget when, but I got a lot of good guests this week. Stay tuned. Freaks. Alright. See you soon. Much love. Big Kiss to everybody.

Speaker 5:          02:57:17       Wow.

Speaker 6:          02:57:33       Yeah.
