Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Here we go, four, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       And we're live. Gentlemen, thanks for being here. Appreciate it. Let everybody know who you are. Lane. Uh, I'm a meathead who likes science, got no bodybuilding when I was young. Uh, and then did a bs in biochemistry, phd in Nutritional Science. Um, kept lifting, did powerlifting, won two national championships, got silver medal at worlds within worlds squat record and it also bodybuilding and one of the natural pro card. They actually have natural bodybuilding, believe it or not. And uh, throughout that time, just know when I first got into it, one magazine said one thing and even in the same magazine they have an article one month next month that would contradicted. So I was like, I'm just going to try and figure this shit out for myself. So, which is the place that a lot of people listening are at right now. Yeah. And it's, it's tough because it's kind of like, who do you trust because, nope, not everybody has the time or the energy to go and do a degree in this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       So. But that was me. I kinda got down the rabbit hole of, all right, let's try and figure this nutrition stuff out. And of course the more I learn, the more I realized I didn't know. But uh, yeah, it just became a passion for me to enter this day. I'm still very, I love this stuff. This is what gets me up, gets me going. Well guys, like you are very important guys who actually trained very hard and really understand the science this is because it's usually one or the other. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I like when I was doing, I graduated my phd in 2010 when we started. We actually both knew each other from the bodybuilding.com message boards, so that was back before social media

Speaker 3:          00:01:43       trained together back in 2006 or seven

Speaker 2:          00:01:45       seven and experimental biology. So this big, there's a big symposium every year for science geeks and we were both going to it and we found out about each other on the forums and we went and trained together and he's a, he's a beast. Uh, and uh, yeah, we really hit it off and we've been friends since then. So for everybody who's looking for a fight, so sorry, we're probably going to be pretty friendly. Well, it's going to be a conversation. We don't need to have a fight. Dom, you've been on the podcast before, but for people didn't listen to that one. Please tell them who you are and what you do.

Speaker 3:          00:02:16       Yeah. Uh, um, keep this sucker google. Yeah, yeah, sure. Uh, I will go. Getting back, I majored in nutrition actually as an Undergrad but didn't actually see a career in it that much. So I went into neuroscience, the net 90, so it's a decade of the brain and uh, my, my formal training is in neuroscience and it got steered towards basically changing the neuropharmacology of the brain with nutrition and that's what the key to genic diet does and it has tremendous benefits I think for military personnel, which is, um, funded by the office of navy research and the Department of Defense to develop ketogenic strategies to enhance readiness, a resilience and performance and safety and military personnel. And what, what did, why specifically does the key to genic diet helped military people? I know there's a thing with a navy seals with preventing epilepsy. Yeah, so a central nervous system, oxygen toxicity, a limitation of that is a limitation of navy seal diving is oxygen toxicity seizures and a antiepileptic drugs are not really a viable option because they can, their side effects, they can decrease cognitive resilience, physical resilience, it key to jenks strategy is something that's being studied now from a basic science mechanistic perspective to animal work to now human studies.

Speaker 3:          00:03:36       So it's not, you know, out in the field yet, but some guys are actually doing it and I studied the science of that. And so when people don't understand what we're saying, um, for some folks who have epilepsy, the ketogenic diet has been shown to stop seizures. Absolutely. Go Google the Charlie Foundation. So that's how I actually got linkedin. And actually I met a natural drug free bodybuilder. His name was Mike Dancer and he had severe terminal epilepsy, Google, Mike Dancer, Ketogenic Diet. And you'll find an amazing story about a guy who used nutrition to manage his epilepsy when drugs failed and he used it to prep and when bodybuilding shows and compete in bodybuilding and the rebreathers sometimes caused seizures with some of the soldiers they can. So, uh, for example, just 50 feet of sea water using a closed circuit rebreather, like a drager, rebreathers, 50 feet of seawater.

Speaker 3:          00:04:30       Your potential for getting oxygen toxicity seizures can occur in just 10 minutes. So that's a little bit of time and that's not very deep. So there's no way to predict that and there's no way as of now to prevent that. So we study physiological biomarkers that could warn people of an impending seizure. And we also develop countermeasures to mitigate oxygen toxicity seizures. I focus mostly on drugs. I'm in a pharmacology and physiology department, but I realized that people with epilepsy, the ketogenic diet was more effective than drugs. So I got steered into, you know, nutrition, which was my undergrad. And then that kicked off about 10 years ago and I've just been deep into probably a dozen or more different applications of nutritional ketosis. Awesome. And laying up and paying attention to online for a long time. One of the things you do a great job with is just calling bullshit on.

Speaker 3:          00:05:21       I mean, you loved call bullshit clearly, but whenever people are overstating claims or people get ridiculous, and I think this is one of the things that is a problem with any diet where people get really enthusiastic about it. That becomes an ideology. Whether it's the key to genic died or the carnivore diet or the, you know, fill in the blanks, Vegan Diet. People decide this is the end all be all. It's going to cure cancer. Make you smarter, Dick's going to grow a foot. All these things are gonna happen. And you do a great job of calling bullshit on that kind of stuff. Yeah, I mean, I, I'm not anti Quito, I'm not anti. I'm anti

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       bullshit. And one of the problems we have is nutrition is replacing religion for a lot of people. So you find something that you identify with and then people start to try to say because they identify with that movement or like for example, vegans, they identify with many of them. Uh, protection of animals, not my job to judge their ethics on that sort of thing, but then they kind of tried to backtrack to find the science to support them as well and they, they pick and choose. And this is guilty of all groups, not just vegans. This is also a lot of key digital diet cell. It's a carnivore diet, whatever have you. If it has the word diet, there's zealots out there who are going after it and I will stick up for. I've stuck up at a scientific conference for the key to genic diet.

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       Uh, you were, we were having a round table about something different and somebody said, well, we know that the ketogenic diet in prayers exercise performance and endurance athletes. And I said, I don't think that's necessarily true of the, it's pretty ambivalent or ambiguous as to whether or not it does. It seems to be kind of individual. But on the whole, on the average, it doesn't seem to impair exercise performance. So it's kind of what you like. But when you have people who, you know, like, like a Gary Taubes, who says, well, calories don't matter. It's all carbohydrates, that sort of thing of the carbohydrate, insulin model of obesity. I mean the research is you're able to do a lot of hand waving about insulin and when you burn so much fat, when you're on a high fat diet, which is true by the way you, you burn a lot of fat, but what they don't talk about is that it's it's overall fat balance, how much fat you store versus how much fat you burn, and when you're on a high fat diet, you store a lot of fat, you also burn a lot of fat.

Speaker 2:          00:07:42       The overall caloric balance is what determines whether or not you will have net storage or net deposition in St Louis for high carb Diet as well. You know this idea that with high insulin it just completely shuts down all fat burning everywhere that that's just not true. Now if you have high carbohydrate, you will burn less fat, but you're also storing less fat as well, and again, the net caloric balance is going to be what determines how much you store because you don't really store carbohydrates as fat. For most people, they did a study, a overfeeding women where they overfed them 50 percent above their caloric maintenance and they found that of 282 grams of fat that they stored during the day and adipose. Only four grams came from carbohydrate. Two hundred and 78 came from fat,

Speaker 3:          00:08:26       so glucose. What about fructose? Fructose causes we think you know, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, so that could be, you know, Denovo Denovo lipogenesis is higher with fructose and you're thinking about people consuming it in a liquid, drinks a 100 to 200 grams a day, which is not uncommon even for my wife, not uncommon,

Speaker 2:          00:08:46       so fructose does seem to have a little bit of different hepatic metabolism, but I was actually across the hall from a professor who was doing a lot of the research on fructose and obesity and fatty liver disease and even he came to the conclusion that if you overfeed fruit dose and it creates a caloric surplus and you're overfeeding for dose, then you can have some wonky stuff start to go on relative to other macros. Die. Try to keep this, try to keep this right next to your face. Got It. Cause that's what she said is so powerful. I talk loud and a lot. It's good. Um, so if you're, if you're doing that, if you're creating that caloric surplus, what you find is when you're in net storage, when you're driving more nutrients into adipose and sometimes liver depending on metabolism, but it takes, it takes a lot of fructose to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:09:38       And a caloric surplus, you start to create a lot of wonky stuff going on. The Mitochondria starts to become dysfunctional and people make a big deal about, oh, well you have, we have claimed now that everything causes, uh, obesity and type two diabetes. For, for first it was fats, carbohydrates, and there's actually a professors out there who actually will claim the protein gives you diabetes. And it's type something for a second. What I mean, the Mitochondria becomes dysfunctional. How does the Mitochondrial, how does that happen? Okay, so I'm going to state for everybody that I'm going out on a limb. This is my opinion. Okay? If you look at the research on obesity and diabetes, what happens is you have everything start to elevate in the bloodstream, so if you measure like there was a professor who thought that branch chain amino acids were causing obesity because they were elevated in the blood stream during or sorry, during type two diabetes, well yeah, branched chain amino acids are elevated, so fatty acids, so triacylglycerides, so as glucose, so is it really those things causing it or is it possible that when you are overfeeding relative to what you burn relative to that turnover, that Mitochondria start to become dysfunctional?

Speaker 2:          00:10:54       Probably a lot due to inactivity and the Mitochondria is, as we call it, the powerhouse of the cell. As you probably learned in high school biology or whatever they taught it to you as that is where everything fluxes through. So that is where you're creating ATP. That's where you're burning through lipids, carbohydrates, that sort of thing. If that becomes dysfunctional and you're not getting in a flux enough pull through that Mitochondria, what happens is you start to back up every part of metabolism, so all the metabolic byproducts, almost all of them inhibit everything within the cell. There's a metabolomic signature for that and Epi phenomenon, if you want to call it that would be elevated branched chain amino acids because the consequence of that and some people, so these things start these byproducts, these metabolic byproducts, because you're not flexing enough through the cell. They start accumulating within the cell and start to inhibit the krebs cycle glycolysis and so everything starts backing up to the point where you also start inhibiting the insulin receptor and now you have glucose, fatty acids and amino acids.

Speaker 2:          00:11:58       Also backing up to the point where they start to overspill into the bloodstream and you see these, this accumulation of all of them in the bloodstream in type two diabetes. And I actually think that again, me going out on a limb that obesity doesn't cause type two diabetes and type two diabetes doesn't cause obesity. That they develop in concert from the same problem, which is overfeeding under activity, so a lot of it is about how much nutrients you're fluxing into cells versus how much energy you're creating. Fluxing them through the cell on out, so when you're overfeeding, whether it be carbohydrate, fat, your fluxing more energy in than you can dispose of, and now you have to do something with it. Well, when you run out of, when you do that much to it and Mitochondria start to become dysfunctional, dysfunctional, you start to not have enough places to put it away and it starts spilling into the bloodstream and now you cause all kinds of problems.

Speaker 2:          00:12:56       So one of the things that we really wanted to talk about here is high carb versus low carb because this is a just a giant point of contention today. Nutrition, especially in terms of athletes with performance in mind. That's a big factor. Whether or not high carb or low carb is the way to go. And there's a lot of zealots on both sides and there's a lot of bullshit and there's a lot of online experts. And one of the great thing about bringing you two guys in here is because you could really actually explained the science behind it. Now you've been great lane at pointing out that there's, it's not a magic bullet and you know, and so many people like to sort of stress it that way, that they, they like to portray ketogenic diet is this, is it, this is the end all, be all.

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       I figured out what to do. This is the way everyone should be eating. You don't think so? I don't think so, because if you look at the weight loss problem in our society, uh, and I'm, I'm writing a book called fat loss forever. When I talk about this in detail, we don't have a weight loss problem. Six out of every seven people were able to lose a significant amount of body weight in their life who are obese or overweight. The problem is the weight regained statistics are absolutely terrifying. Uh, within one year, 70 percent will put it all back on. Within two years it's 85 percent. Within three years it's 95 percent. So that means diets have a 95 percent failure rate and of those people, one third to two thirds will add more than they originally lost and this gets kind of into Yoyo dieting and I talked about that as well.

Speaker 2:          00:14:29       But the real problem is that people don't stick to pick something that's sustainable for them all the recert, if there's one bit of research out there that, that we have that shows how to create lasting weight loss. And you look at the people who were the five percent who actually keep it off, uh, it's that they pick something that's sustainable, whether it be key to genic, whether it be low carb, high or low fat, whatever it is, Vegan something that they can sustain and make a lifestyle. If, because if you look at Meta analyses for our listeners, med analyses are, are kind of a study of studies. So they take researchers take studies that have similar parameters and they kind of lumped them together and they look at, okay, what's the consensus amongst these studies? And they have advanced statistics. They used to run this. If you look at low carb versus low fat, there's no difference in adherence overall on the whole there's no difference and there's no difference in weight loss, there's no difference in blood lipids, even glycaemic control. So there was a study where they met analysis of, I think it was 23 studies, over 3000 people where they looked at, okay, if you control calories, so calories are equated, does low carb versus low fat make a difference on weight loss, glycemic control, those sorts of things.

Speaker 3:          00:15:53       The key to genic diet. So by definition we have an objective biomarker that defines the ketogenic diet is the only diet that actually has something that you can measure in your blood that say you're on this diet and when your ketone levels are elevated, that confers many different benefits, uh, that I believe can enhance adherence to the Diet. Before we get into the woods here, I want to clarify one thing, the difference between someone being on a diet and being able to sustain it and not being able to stand in gaining all that weight back.

Speaker 2:          00:16:24       Isn't that a discipline issue? Well, partly, but we kind of had to start looking at, okay, if we, if we go in, let me read, let me read circle. We have to find what requires the least amount of discipline for somebody to stick to. Because discipline is, is while some people have more, some people have less. Um, it is a finite resource. So when do we normally find that people like kind of drop off whatever they're doing. It's when they're stressed out, work, stressing them out, they're going through a divorce, those kinds of things, right? That's where are our discipline kind of wanes because we're trying to be so disciplined for this other thing and it's draining us. So what happens with, with diet is in people who are busy, people who have a lot of stress in their life, that's where they really start overeating.

Speaker 2:          00:17:16       So we have to find something that I look at it. Let's find something that requires the minimal amount of, of discipline for a person so that when your life goes to absolute shit, you can still stick to it. And so for some people that is a very, very individual thing and they see this in the dietary studies that what works for one person to create a deficit and sustainable isn't the same way for another person. And Dom even commented on this about his wife Chella, she does much better on a higher ratio of carbohydrates to fats.

Speaker 3:          00:17:49       Yeah, I mean, early

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       on it was obvious that she wasn't going to change her diet at the time that we met like 10 years ago, most we, I was really getting into this and I really felt that for me at least, uh, but she would stop at checkers and get a burger with a sugary drink it. And she's tremendously carbon tolerance. She was very skinny as a kid and she tolerated a carbohydrate. She's very carbohydrate tolerance. Did I say intolerant? Okay. Uh, yeah. So, and, and you know, if the Diet low carb I feel, and maybe in key to genic, putting it in under that umbrella works, I think for up to 25 to 30 percent of people, uh, especially at their carbohydrate intolerant. And I believe that it does that by virtue of elevating Ketones, shifting your, uh, the neuropharmacology of the brain, for example, it works through Grelin, it works through, there's new science emerging right now showing that appetite regulation is influenced a positively by a nutritional ketosis in ways that were just starting to learn.

Speaker 2:          00:18:55       Now what? You can certainly feel it. It's one of the things about the ketogenetic diet. When you're in that state, all of a sudden you're just not hungry to say there's not a, an overwhelming need for food. Yeah, I'm, I haven't had anything to eat today. I mean, when I was eating massive plates of Pasta Twenty five years ago and I went to this this long without food, I would start getting shaky. I would, I would have a hypoglycemic response. And I'm completely resilient to that. And that has major implications for military personnel being keto adapted, not just for performance, preventing seizures. I think for a cognitive function too. But you, uh, it's very liberating. So meal frequency is not an issue. So if you're in austere environments where you have limited food availability, that becomes a major issue. And if you're working as a scientist and you can't, you know, you're working with animals, you're doing experiments, you don't have time to eat.

Speaker 2:          00:19:48       I need to maintain that cognitive function. I needed to be sharp, you know, with limited boot. So it worked very good for me throughout my professorship, you know, getting tenure and things like that where I could just put more time and energy into my work without having to stop, prepare a meal, eat a meal, clean up. Like I think I wasted a lot of time doing that when I was eating five to six meals a day. He said something that I think you've called bullshit on before the phrase carb intolerant. So yeah. So that was actually going to be one of the things that could say, hey, we have something we can disagree about. Carb tolerance, carb, carb. Would you would say how we define that? Yes. Yes. So if you have to find it by a blood marker, your glucose response to a meal.

Speaker 2:          00:20:30       Okay. So a couple of things. I want to come right out and frame this whole discussion real quick. So we both agree that in terms of weight loss and body composition, that your total calorie intake per day is the most important thing, correct? Yes. I believe the key to genic strategy is a way to regulate that, right? So with, with carbon tolerance, if, if you look at the benefits of like on blood glucose, blood lipids, it is almost 90 to 95 percent explained by weight loss. So you can take people put them on a high carb, very low fat diet, their blood glucose in their blood, lipids will drop, eat even with like higher insulin levels than people who are in a a low carb diet if they're on a calorie restricted calorie restricted. Now again, that that becomes a very individual thing. I, you know, if somebody says, hey, I like a ketogenic diet because for me it helps me to create a calorie deficit.

Speaker 2:          00:21:28       I can stick to it, hey, knock yourself out. That is no problem. But that is not always gonna work. Some people don't feel that satiated on a ketogenic diet. There are people who do feel hungrier on that. So that is a very individual response. And again, when we look at studies we're looking at means, right? So we're talking about averages and there are outliers, like if you look at any Gaussian distribution chart, which is kind of how populations distributed based on a certain treatment, you have about 60 to 70 percent that fall into the, the average. Then you have another, you know, 10, 20 percent that are kind of do a little bit better one way versus the other. And then you have five percent on either end that are, sorry, two and a half percent on either end that are outliers. Right? So just to frame this again, let's take weightlifting.

Speaker 2:          00:22:13       We know weightlifting makes you bigger and stronger, right? Like that is not up for debate. We agree on that. There are studies that have shown that some people who are beginners, where you should be gaining a lot of muscle very quickly, uh, some people will go from the first time they walk into the gym Squat Ninety Five, 12 weeks, they're, they're squatting 400 pounds. Some people don't get stronger. They've actually been. Studies were over 12 weeks. There is a few individuals who did not get stronger, so those are your outliers right there. So if we circle this back to Ketogenic Diet, I'm not sitting here and saying that somebody may actually physiologically do better on a ketogenic diet versus a a, a lower fat diet. That's a very individual response, but when we start making recommendations for people, what we should start with is okay created calorie deficit that allows you to lose some weight because if we look at the studies and we look at if we equate for protein, because that's a big thing.

Speaker 2:          00:23:05       So if you look at some of the studies were Volec did where he compared like, uh, you're kind of food guide pyramid type diet to a ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diets were a little bit higher protein. That protein has a thermogenic effect and also an appetite suppression effect when you equate for those. And there's been 32 studies, there was a recent med analysis done of 32 studies and acquainted for calories and protein. Absolutely no difference in fat loss when you equate for those two calories and protein because protein is a big one because protein has a big benefit on thermogenesis and weight loss. Also a lean body, mass retention, which is huge because one of the reasons people regain weight is because when they lose weight, they tend to lose fat and muscle and when they regain it, it's almost all fat in the initial phase as far as

Speaker 3:          00:23:54       and may not have included data with the key to genic diet. So I know, you know, when I did the die, I've seen a lot of blood work, so for example, my hemoglobin h, one c, triglycerides, hs, crp goes down, insulin goes down, blood pressure goes down, and that, that all those, all those changes happened without my bodyweight changing. So that would kind of argue against that. You needed to catch us deficit. Uh, and I've seen it many times, but once you could, I could be eating 80 to 90 percent carbs and reduced my body weight and get changes in all that I could actually increase my carbs. And if I create a calorie deficit, you know, my hemoglobin h, one c will go down, my sugar will go down and things like that. So that is really the draw that's like, that trumps everything, that calorie deficit, so that that's an important thing.

Speaker 2:          00:24:42       So that's what. And that's what I think a lot of people miss. Okay. I think that that, what I'll say is. Sorry, I'm just saying like, I think

Speaker 3:          00:24:51       it's very powerful too that these changes that I just mentioned can occur without a will, without changing your body weight. So they are just, you know, you're fundamentally changing your metabolism when you do that from car. And that has pretty wide ranging implications.

Speaker 2:          00:25:07       So I think that what I'm going to say is that if you, if we're going to talk about people getting healthier, the first thing we need to start with is let's not lose 50 percent are going about five percent, right? So if I tell somebody, hey, find a diet, you can stick to that sustainable. And if you can lose 10 percent, you can lose 10 percent of your body weight. Even for obese people, they get almost all the health benefits in the first 10 percent now. Now maybe some people like you or people who respond really well to a ketogenic diet, I'm not, again, there's outliers or people on the other sides of the Gaussian curve. If you do a little bit better on there then great, but if you find a ketogenic diet is completely unsustainable for you and you're not, you're not able to stick to it, but you're trying to do it because you're trying to get a little bit better blood glucose regulation.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       You're, you're, you know, you're kind of shooting yourself in the foot because if you could stick to it, like let's say for the individual, a higher carb diet was easier for them to stick to. They could lose weight on that. Then that's the bulk of their health benefits they're going to get from it. I'm having a hard time with these terms easier because I don't know exactly why it would be easier, wouldn't be easier and I always wonder again, is this a discipline issue because that's your experience. Yeah, it comes down for this, for sure. My

Speaker 3:          00:26:24       preference, but I believe that by when you follow low carb, not even ketogenic diet, the variability of the fluctuations in your insulin and Blood Glucose, the Postprandial dip in blood glucose that you get after it, that's virtually abolished or significantly attenuated and then you have a, you know, ketones are working through Grelin for example. You could just, you could eat a normal diet and drink ketones and it's actually suppressing your appetite through Grelin. So we know that these changes or reductions in and you're saying, yeah, okay, so um, so these changes are happening, but they're, my sister for example, you know, follow the Ketogenic Diet and found it easy to follow. But she gained weight because she was eating all these fat bombs that she was making. So she far and a lot of people don't necessarily need a nutritionist to tell them what to do, but they needed like a nutritional psychotherapist or something, you know, their, their relationship with food is really.

Speaker 3:          00:27:25       And I think that's what lane has a firm grasp on. There's no substitute for experience. And Lane has worked with so many different clients and knows that, you know, you could probably follow the cue j dot your listeners are probably fans of die. I can do it. I love fatty food, you know, a high fat food look our food. But generally speaking it's, you know, you have to approach it from the perspective of sort of eating behavior. And I think that that's really. People want to go off the Diet. It's just a natural human trait.

Speaker 4:          00:27:53       Yeah, it's a weird psychological trait, right? You just want to cheat. You want to just stuff your face with cupcakes every now and then. And then you just feel like it's too much torture to keep yourself on this narrow path of high fat, low carb, moderate protein. But you know,

Speaker 3:          00:28:08       years ago, 10 years ago that was the case. But now there is key to genic brownies or cookies. There's many different food companies like shirt

Speaker 4:          00:28:17       got chicken. I've tried, I tried so hard. Go to Quito. I have a real one and a kito cookie and then fucking real fucking gets eaten every time. Yeah, well they, they are evolving. Just, you know, food technology and evolving some of them, no foods, make some good stuff. Go to go to Quito, nutrition.org. And there's some things there that I would say about 10 or 20

Speaker 3:          00:28:40       percent passed the test, meaning that they taste okay and they actually do what they say they actually elevate ketones or you know, don't call it the glycine

Speaker 4:          00:28:49       on some of those Keto Kookies seem like they have no foundation. Like you bite in the Galway, like as you're eating them, it's like they dissolve. Do you have like a good toll house cookie, a good real chocolate chip cookie and you bite into that soccer, you know, it's bad for you. But God damn it feels good while it's being tried. The quest protein cookies. Yes. They're pretty good. Yeah. Pretty good. Pretty good. Yeah. They can't fuck with real cookies. Yeah. Well I dip. I dip them in, in like sour cream, right? And then I eat them or coconut cream so that then it becomes good to just get a commitment to a life that you bring that up. Interesting though. Um, if you look at people that think they're addicted to sugar, that sugar is a lot. If you look at things like cookies and cakes and it's actually they have more calories from fats than they do sugars. It's sugar and fat together

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       is hyper palatable. But so we know one of the things I was going to bring up as, um, you know, this idea that the sugar is so inherently bad and you said that the cookie, you know, we view that as an inherently bad thing. But what if I told you that a certain people, not everybody, everybody's different, but there are certain people who, if you tell them, hey, you can have that cookie every once in a while if you track it, work it into your macronutrient intake, that that's fine, that, that actually improve their adherence to diet. So because you give them a reward, no, not a reward system. You're not a dog, don't reward yourself with food because, because increased flexibility, uh, actually usually improves adherence. So we see this actually with training to a athletes are when you do a flexible training model where they have to get in a certain amount of training, but they kind of can pick and choose yourself, which days are hard and which days are a little bit they actually do better.

Speaker 2:          00:30:34       Diet is very similar to that. So now you always have to sacrifice something in order to, uh, if you want to lose weight, right? So if you're doing a ketogenic diet, what you're sacrificing is saying, well I like the spontaneous reductions in appetite, so I don't mind eating these foods so I can get that if you're doing like kind of what, I don't want to say I popularized it, but myself and some other people on the message boards popularized something called flexible dieting where you can eat essentially whatever you want as long as you hit your protein, carbohydrate and fat targets. Now what you're sacrificing is okay. You're tracking every day. Do you do that through an APP? Through what? An APP? Uh, no, I'm old school. I actually just do it through excel. I've my girlfriend holly, she has an app on her phone and she, she has me like if she's driving, said, oh well you put in what I just ate.

Speaker 2:          00:31:23       I'm like, Babe, I don't even know. I have no idea how to work this thing. You know? So because when I went to do my graduate studies, I mean I wanted to find magic foods. I wanted to find something that would say, how else can you make a living? You have to set yourself apart. I mean if I'm over here saying it's hard for me to sell what I, what I do, because I'm saying, well, everything in moderation and you got to be diligent and you got to have these behaviors and that doesn't sound sexy when there's another guy over here saying, now bro, it's just carbs. I know what tablet isms complicated and everything, but it's just carbs. You know, when I started working with people and I've worked with over 1500 people coaching and nutrition online over the past 13 years, which actually probably taught me more than my, my phd did. Um, what I found was, is that people were so different individually in terms of what, what made them tick, you know, now I feel like I should probably go back and get some kind of interesting to biologically what makes them tick or a psychological, both, both, so I can't sit here and say by the research that that carbohydrate versus fat makes a difference on fat loss. But what I can tell you is that some people just seem to do better on lower carb, higher fat. But also some people I with just seem to

Speaker 4:          00:32:39       do better with higher carb, lower fat. Now, whether that's a psychological thing or a physiological thing, it's hard to tease out medically to. I think we all have different snips, you know, that, you know, some people have suppressed fatty acid oxidation pathways, other are like screaming fast metabolizers, you know, or fat or sugar metabolizers. Yeah. So, but if you look at, like I remember I had a conversation with, um, with the, the researcher Dr Nakamura at Illinois who was doing some of that fructose stuff when I was, when I was a first year Grad student. I said, well, it's this, this high fructose corn syrup, this is what's causing obesity. Right? And he's like, well, it's easy to over consume. You know, like if you take a soda and you drink it, you're not less hungry than you were. Stopped, very satiating. He said, but if you're, if you're controlling your calories, it doesn't seem to be more lysogenic than comparable carbohydrate.

Speaker 4:          00:33:33       And I remember thinking, well, that can't be right. All these people say that high fructose corn syrup, it was like the worst thing in the world for you. There was, there was a few studies that really changed my opinion on sugar. Now the listeners are going to hear this and think that I'm advocating for sugar. I'm not, not talking about in the context of a calorie surplus, a surplus than the ovary can, which kind of explains the state of the United States, you know, uh, partly partly. So if you look at sugar intake, there's. So this Kinda gets back to the carbohydrate, insulin obesity model. Uh, if you look at sugar intake over the last 50 years, 100 years, it went up very steadily with obesity until around the mid nineties and then it took a sharp dip while obesity continued to climb. And again, that's just correlation data.

Speaker 4:          00:34:20       But if you do look at the overall calorie intake versus obesity rates, it's like an r squared of like point nine four, which is really, he really sugar include high fructose corn syrup. Is that lumped into. So this was added sugars, this was added sugars, but there was a study done by a metabolic ward studies. So again, I'm gonna stop you there. Are you saying that this is added sugars, not high fructose fructose corn syrup. So when you talk about the graph of consumption, that sugar dropped off, but high fructose corn syrup did not. Is that our, because that took over many of the products. So it's an increase in obesity, but a decrease in sugar consumption. But you're not saying a decrease in high fructose corn syrup consumption. So I don't know that I'd have to look that up. So here, here's, here's me being a scientist in saying the three magic words, I don't know that one of the last conferences I went to showed that like the rise over the last 10 to 15 years like skyrocketing, like high fructose corn syrup and sugar was taken out. High Fructose Corn Syrup is subsidized but farmers a lot cheaper and more. Would you agree that it's essentially your body way? Processes is essentially the same sugar versus high fructose corn syrup cows the calorie. Well, so sugar, sucrose is 50 percent glucose. Fifty percent fructose, high fructose corn syrup is 55 percent fructose,

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       45 percent glucose. But if you're saying that that five percent is what's creating obesity, eh? Now again, psychologically, some people just down sodas like it's their job, you know? And if you're doing that, especially as children, that's a big, big no, no, he kissed the Mexican kind with the cane sugar kids now with high with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and that did not exist. But I would say that we've got a little kid like kids from corn syrup. I think it's due to an excess surplus calories and those surplus calories being high fructose corn syrup. So if you're, if you're used to eating a certain amount of calories and you may, and we back when we were actually maintaining your weight back in the, before the sixties, we were reading about 2100 calories a day. That was the average. Uh, and now it's like 2,800 is the average consumption.

Speaker 2:          00:36:25       The United States amongst adults. Um, I think I eat a lot more than that, but, but you trained but you train and you have a higher lean body mass. So that's, that's, that's fine. Now some people, yeah, we, that's a whole other rabbit hole. Um, the, if you, if you start adding sodas in which aren't satiating at all, they don't positively affect your hunger hormones. Uh, but you continue your same normal food intake. Boom. I mean, you can start to store, right? Yeah. So, but I can't tell somebody, hey, there's no way you can lose weight and drink a soda because that's not true. Um, there was a study done by a servlet and they looked at high-glycemic a diet versus low glycemic, and I mean extreme. They did a, one group had over 100 grams of sugar a day. Another group had a 10 grams or less per day are sorry, it was 11 grams or less per day and they looked at the differences in weight loss, blood lipids, all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:37:21       Did that everyday for carbohydrates. So the group that ate 10 grams of sugar or less a day to day eat the same amount of total carbohydrates, same amount of total carbs. Okay. So low-glycemic versus high-glycemic processed carbs can spike your glucose more than sugar. Right? So they did have a fire at higher fiber intake. But what the. Well, they did find that they had a higher insulin responses to the meal. The high sugar group did, but no differences in weight loss. So they, both, both groups lost weight. Uh, the only real difference was the, the, the lower glycemic group had a little bit better. Both groups improved, improved cholesterol. The lower glycemic group had just a little bit better improvement probably because they were eating higher fiber, which can bind cholesterol and you excrete it. I would like to see what happened if they equated.

Speaker 2:          00:38:06       So again, it's, it's creating that calorie deficit. Both groups lost weight. Now is it more difficult to create a calorie deficit if you're eating a lot of sugar? Yes. Okay. So I always tell people your diet is like a budget if you're practicing something like flexible dieting. Right? So if I've got somebody like myself who has above average muscle mass, hopefully I can say that people on the Internet probably going to do is wear a shirt with his name on it. So. Okay, I'll say it. You have above average muscle mass. Thank you. You're welcome. So, so if you have above average last semester, you train hard, you have a faster metabolism naturally. I mean I've seen people who could maintain their body weight on six, 7,000 calories a day. You have a higher metabolic rate, you have a really big budget. So if you make $100,000,000 a year, is it a big deal for you to go out and buy a $500,000 sports car if you can still pay your mortgage and pay all the other requirements that you have? No, it's fine. But if you make 80 grand a year, should you go out and buy a $500,000 sports car? Probably not. Right? And if you make 30 you should be on Nikita. Done.

Speaker 2:          00:39:17       Well you'd have increased for deficiency. So it's the same thing. So like people up. So pop tarts somehow became the model of the flexible dieting movement because people were, here's why it's Kinda like counterculture. So pop tart zealots out there. It's like, so whenever you have. So clean eating became a thing amongst bodybuilding's, we say eat clean even though there's no objective, there's no objective definition of that. Um, so people were like, Oh yeah, well I'm getting shredded night pop tart everyday. Right? So a lot of your followers do that. They do now. Now I don't even like pop tarts. He'd be honest. Did you start this? No, no, no. It's not, I don't know who else. Hang on, let me, let me put the context of this so it's more about people saying, hey, I can still eat these foods I enjoy and I'm still losing weight because I'm with it.

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       I'm in a calorie deficit and I'm hitting my protein, carb and fat targets, but if you're somebody with a slow metabolism and you're not exercising very much and maybe all you're eating is 100 grams of carbs a day, should you spend 75 grams of those carbs on two pop tarts? Hell No. That's a terrible idea because you're not going to be able to hit your other micronutrients and those sorts of things, but if you're eating 4,000 calories, like an Alberto Nunez friend of ours, if you're eating 4,000 calories, date and losing weight, is it a big deal? If he has to pop tarts? Not really because he actually had one competitor. Again, a competitor who had such a fast metabolism that he was actually having a lot of gi dysfunction because he, he, he, he was eating like 700 grams of carbs in 200 grams of fat per day just to maintain his weight and he said, I, I, I feel bloated all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:40:58       And I said, well, what are you eating? Like what are your foods? And it was chicken, rice and Broccoli, and I said, it's a peanut butter for fats. And I'm like, well, no wonder dude, you're having 150 grams of fiber a day. You're literally full of Shit. Like your shit is like literally backed up to your esophagus. Okay. So I said, do me a favor, eats and pizza, eat some pop tarts, eat some more calorically dense foods and see how you felt for three days. He emailed me after three days, he was like, man, I feel so much better. I dropped like three pounds. I feel amazing because he doesn't make any sense because he got fired. The pop tart generation. Uh, he also inspired and I watched this play

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       out online and she sounded really bad. Well, lane actually inspired a generation of drug free bodybuilders to go and do their phds, you know, and uh, actually one's in my lab right now, man, student Andrew for a little while. Yeah, amazing student and I think he, he learned a lot just from watching lane or so, uh, but I think, you know, that it was amazing to see these guys eating that amount of pop tarts and junk foods and Bob and I learned a lot from that, but I think they could do it with, with better carbohydrates. So. So what works for performance, what works for bodybuilding may not be, is probably not optimal for longevity and health. So that's an important point. You know, lean winds. I, yeah, the audio is okay. So I know where he's coming from, but you know, I'd like to hear his opinion.

Speaker 3:          00:42:28       Yeah. So before you do that, why do you think that it would be an issue? What would be the issue with sugar and with pop tarts and junk food? What will be the negative effects? Biologic? I think the accumulation of the Post Prandial spikes in glucose and insulin over time, especially in the context of a calorie surplus, could be a bad thing. If you are doing a calorie surplus to example, for example, to gain weight and mass over time, which bodybuilders do following contest in the off season, uh, I think it's even more important almost to actually stick with foods, carbohydrate sources that are lower glycemic. You know, you can only tolerate so much fiber. But I think if you are running a calories or if you are doing a ketogenic diet and you have a calorie surplus, that could be a bad thing. Your triglycerides, your triglycerides will go up.

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       So you are, you're putting too much fat in the system and that what it would go up on a higher carb diet, higher carb diet too. So, I mean I kind of would stay along the lines of maybe protein, but you just, you titrate it in, in a reasonable amount. But I just think that the negative, you know, that could come out of that is that you're, you know, I'm following a blood glucose curve, right? And insulin curve, and, and I see this very dramatically, for example, my student who is a type one diabetic, Andrew [inaudible], who's in and he wears a Dexcom continuous blood glucose monitoring system and his insulin requirements dramatically dropped with low carb and his glucose fluctuations dramatically improved. And that's going to pay big dividends probably if you have type one diabetes, you ever, you know, the 10 top things, uh, on, on how humans die, you have a greater risk for every one of those, you know, dramatic cuts 10 years off your life if the tighter you can keep your glucose levels, your blood glucose and your insulin levels that in the long run I feel it's going to pay.

Speaker 3:          00:44:29       Big Science still has to show that

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       I think it's not totally clear, uh, but I think we can for type one diabetics, which I think we can apply that data to the, to the population if they control their glucose levels, that pays big dividends in the long run lane. So a couple things. Yes. You touched on a couple of points I was going to bring up, but I want to address one thing first, which is a, the higher post Prandial insulin in those negative effects on health. Um, so if you have, they've done studies on this, on BMI versus insulin. Now Bmi as a, we can debate about how useful a measure it is, but in general it reflects body fat in the average population, not lifters, but in the average BMI, by the way, for people who are listening is a ratio of your height versus your weight that generally reflects obesity and you're obese.

Speaker 2:          00:45:19       I'm so, if you lift weights, I'm morbidly obese. It seems so silly. It is. But if you look at the general population who doesn't exercise, it's actually pretty darn accurate. Um, gets factored into your insurance, which is not as it relates to your can look at you and say some bs. Some insurances will do like a waist to chest measurement, which, which helps, but anyway, so post Prandial Insulin, they've looked at the relationship between people who have their BMS and post prandial insulin. They find that people with higher BMI have higher post Prandial insulin, but the opposite relationship does not hold true for people who have higher insulin, do not necessarily have higher bmi and they've done this in med analysis. So what that says is again, that if you are obese type two diabetic metabolic syndrome profile, that you will have elevated levels of insulin because your body's becoming insensitive to it because of all the dysfunction that we talked about, but just because you secrete higher insulin doesn't mean that you're going to have more body fat.

Speaker 2:          00:46:22       And there was a study done actually by one of the proponents of the carbohydrate insulin hypothesis, um, that looked at what's called Mendelian randomization where basically the idea is you have different gene variants like we were talking about. And if, for example, like they've done this with ldl cholesterol are. Sorry, yes, ldl cholesterol. We believe most people believe the ldl cholesterol has some contribution towards heart disease. It's a pretty, I would say it's a pretty strong now. People can over controversial text dependent and individual. When they look at these, these gene variants, people who have gene variants where they run lower ldl, have lower rates of heart disease, people who are higher heart rates. If you look at that with insulin at best, insulin explains 10 percent of obesity at absolute best and that study actually showed that high level of bias. It was between one to 10 percent. So we're not, I'm not putting out the, the idea that maybe insulin has some effect talking about fasting or post Prandial

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       insulin. Oh, overall, overall, I, I'm guessing probably more so fasting. How did they measure insulin? I mean we, we have hemoglobin h, one c for like uh, you know, so there was another unit that,

Speaker 2:          00:47:42       there was another med analysis where they looked at a higher carb versus lower carb diets, equating calories, looking at Hba one c and saw that. So the, the differences in weight loss, we're no different like we've discussed when calories are acquainted, but also the differences in Hba. One C reduction were different. They were the same. Now you asked about health and you know, consuming some of these quote unquote bad foods. If you do it in the but you said in the context of a caloric surplus, right, which is the important thing because they helped to create a surplus, but in a deficit that what's the downside? Because kind of when you talk to people who were not, not ketogenic necessarily, but proponents of quote unquote clean eating, which again has no real objective definition when you say, okay, well a pop tart, maybe you can lose weight up, it can't be good for you.

Speaker 2:          00:48:34       Okay, well then we have to have some objective measurement to show this by, right? Like because otherwise it's. Do you believe in magic? Okay, so if you look at processed foods, what they have found with processed foods is that you have a lower energy expenditure from them. Okay, so you have a certain amount of what we call t e, f thermic effective food. A higher protein has a higher t f than carbohydrate and fat. Okay? So we know the higher protein diets actually cause more weight loss and better lean body mass protection. Part of that is through the increase thermogenesis of, of the TF thermic effect of food. Well, with processed foods, you have a lower tef okay, but that doesn't mean you can't eat any processed foods and, and lose weight you can eat, just means you might have to eat a little bit lower calories overall. Does that make sense?

Speaker 3:          00:49:18       There was a key to genic pop tart and it was made with, with almond tastes like shit. We know that if we amens were probably, you know, other nuts or things just given an example, you know, we don't fully digest, assimilate and utilize those calories. They pass through us. So with the pop tart, uh, I think it's pretty high with like raw, like, like a salad with nuts and things like that. Like it becomes significant over time with the pop tart, like you can basically 100 percent of that is going into your system and it's causing a hormonal response. So the food that we eat creates is not only calories but creates a hormonal response and also from the brain perspective can change the neuropharmacology of your brain. I mean, that's how I got into the key to genic diet because it fundamentally changes neurotransmitter systems and reward systems. And things like that, right, but hormones,

Speaker 2:          00:50:15       people get so hung up on hormones and and if you look at the research data just doesn't support it. Like with Insula, whatnot. Now in terms of like losing weight and you're, you're what happens with Leptin and Ghrelin and all those kinds of things. That is a huge. One of the. One of the things we talked about before the podcast started, we had about a 30 minute podcast and we did actually, you know, people say things like, one of the reasons people are really mistrustful of kind of the calories in calories out model is because it is viewed as a to isolated variables, calories in, calories out or separate. That's not true. Calories in effects. Calories out. Okay. There are a moving target. So people will say, well I ate in a calorie deficit and I didn't lose weight. No, you ate and what you thought was a calorie deficit and you didn't lose weight, but if you didn't lose weight, it was not a calorie deficit by definition.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       Okay. So retaining water or something. Yeah. Who's when we look at dieting, like just dieting in general over time lowers your metabolic rate, right? So if you take somebody, they actually did a rat study. Again, rats, but rats tend to respond pretty similar to humans into. Would you agree with that in terms of blood? I mean, you do a lot of rats, rats and mouse studies. Uh, yeah, I, I think there's a lot of overlap there. Yeah, they're good model. So again, when we have to put that out there because we want to, we don't want to oversell it. They did A. depends on the context of what you're studying. Of course, like you don't want it to be like animal studies can be helpful, but you don't want to do like an insulin study in cows because cows are ruminants in there. They don't care about insulin anyway, they took rats, they took them to, to diet cycles.

Speaker 2:          00:51:56       Okay. So this is kind of back to the Yoyo dieting thing. Um, and they looked at okay and they took obese rats of them down to a kind of normal level than they, than they basically gave him as much food as they want to let him eat back to the original obese level dye to them down again to the previous level. And then let him read back up. What they found was absolutely astonishing. There are food efficiency with so far up because their metabolic rate became suppressed every time they died. It down. Your body has this self defense system that you activate every time you dye it. I talk about this in my shameless plug book. Um, so the first time they died, if that's the kind of one times rate that they lost a fat ass, when they let them regain it, they regained it twice as fast as they lost it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:41       Then the second time they tried to lose it, they lost it at half the original rate. Then when they regained it, the second time they gave you gained it three times as fast their food efficiency would weigh up the ability to lose it. Have you noticed? Have you noticed? Well, what's that? Lucid get faster as well. No, no. They took him twice as long to lose the same amount of weight. Sorry, I probably didn't explain it very well. Yeah, I took him twice as long to lose the same amount of weight and they regained it in a third the time of the original. So your body's getting accustomed to famine. Exactly. Because every time you diet it, and we see this with yo Yo dieters who spend. How many people do you know that seemed to be perpetually on a diet, but they just had that short overfeeding period in between diets underneath.

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       It really does because every time you died you're activating your body self defense system. How many fighters do you know that every time they die it gets harder and harder for them to make weight. While they're doing more than that, they're. They're cutting weight. The cutting weight is ruthless. They're essentially almost dying. Right? But part of that is there. They're having to crash diet super low. So what is the signal you're telling your body? Because you have to always think about things. From an evolutionary perspective. My Phd advisor was great about this, he'd always asked his name, was Dr Don Lemon, brilliant guy, and he would say, why do you think the body did this? Well, if you think about what are the regulatory mechanisms of becoming fat versus becoming too thin? Right? So one, one danger is you starve to death. The other danger is you get so fat that a Predator can come get you, which is more dangerous in the last 20,000 years. It's family, it's family. So your body creates much tighter defense system there. So when you diet, your metabolic rate slows way down. I mean if you've, you've ever these guys who cut weight, so by the time they're ready to get a fight, for example, their metabolic rates really slow. Then what happens after they fight, they eat a crap ton of food because they're there, they're Grelin is way up, Leptin is way down, insulin is way down and they regain it really fast. Now, what

Speaker 3:          00:54:50       to assume? Just to interject that if you die it for 16 weeks for a show, for example, or a contest that what you actually educated me in like 10 years ago and I thought there was this like post contest rebound and in two weeks there'd be this anabolic window or whatever for fat. It actually, if you die hard for 16 weeks to make way, it takes an equal amount of time to get your metabolism back actually to that level. Again, maybe d. So lane coined the term, right? Reverse dieting river, I don't know if I call, I pointed it and did this with metabolic chambers and in rats. And then use a variety of different approaches to determine how fast it, it actually takes to, uh, to bring your metabolism backup. And if different strategies can be used to ramp up your metabolism,

Speaker 2:          00:55:35       well, because when you regain it, you regain fat really quickly, but your metabolic rate is more sluggish to return. So they actually did a study with the biggest loser participants. And this is why I'm so big on what is sustainable that it has to be sustainable. They looked at um, so they last on average, like a quite a bit of weight, I can't remember the exact numbers, but they lost a bunch of weight over the 30 weeks because they starve them and they exercised the crap out of them and they saw that their metabolic rate dropped 500 calories more than you would predict just by the amount of body fat and lean body mass they lose. This is what's called metabolic adaptation. When you defined the metabolic rate dropping, what do you mean by that? What's the. So? So you have. So we can calculate all this stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       So your overall total daily energy expenditure, you're tde is made up of your basal metabolic rate, which is what you burn. Like what we're doing right now just sitting around doing oxygen consumption car to production. I actually actually to be real, it's just laying down doing nothing. So basically the energy you burn keeping the lights on, right? That's one component. It's about 50 to 60 percent in most people. Then you have your neat, which is like this, like I'm moving my hands, I'm ambulatory movement, non voluntary movement. This stuff will actually go down when you diet, like if you've ever been around, people will go down. Yes. You stopped fidget. Spontaneous movement goes down. It's a huge modifier. So like if you look at either the DVD, when I was prepping for a show back in 2010, I blink slower. I'm not kidding. You and I talk slower.

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       Yeah. Mind you were like on volume. It looks like you're. You're right. Now I'm all hyped up on in the life of lane with that says, oh absolutely. Like you're so your body, this is your body genic di would help you. So. So when you think about. So there's neat. That's that. Then your exercise activity, which is intuitive, that's how many calories you burn exercising, and then there's what's called the thermic effect of food, which we already discussed. How much energy required to get energy out of food. Okay. And all those add up to your total daily energy expenditure and we can predict based on equations how, what your metabolic rate should be. So these people, their metabolic rate was 500 calories a day lower than it should have been. Just based off the weight they lost because if you lose muscle and lose fat, you have less weight to carry around, right?

Speaker 2:          00:57:59       So your metabolic rate goes down just from that, but it goes down way more than it should. That is your. The first prong of your body self defense system to stop you from starving yourself is to become more efficient. We hear the word efficiency and we think, wow, that's. That's a good thing. Think about if your body fat levels were a gas tank and you have. You had a car, okay. You would not want to be efficient, right? You to have one of the old suburbans, it was like half a mile per gallon, right? You don't want the Prius because you can go way longer. So going back to that study on rats, they became so much more efficient with their food, and this is the second prong of your body is self defense system is to not only slow down your metabolic rate while you're dieting, but to start activating systems that deal with restoring.

Speaker 2:          00:58:42       Once you actually start overeating again. Have you ever done a long diet or known somebody who did it and then they start eating again? It's like everything sticks to you. It's like you just. It's like you like, how did I gain five pounds from one day and people are like, oh, it's water. Well, water doesn't stay around for six months, so it's not water that is your body preparing all these systems, so even like enzymes that deal with fat storage while you're dieting actually go up because it's preparing your body for restoring and then even probably the most interesting thing is it all falls back on the importance of tracking Macros, which is completely ignored with guys coming off of a fight or fitness competitors. Let yourself blow up really quickly. It's a myth that your body is set up to be anabolic or to gain muscle.

Speaker 2:          00:59:30       That is for your setup for fat. Yeah, but the point I'm trying to make is that the way most people diet, which is this kind of. I mean, you know, you've probably been around people who do this stuff. It's a lot of people, they they pick the next fad diet. Whatever's popular, they do it, they lose some weight and the navy gain it. My Dad lost 30 pounds on a ketogenic diet, regained 50 right now. The real problem is in the macros. Now he does, but the real problem, and he's down 50 pounds again, but the real problem is if we used to think adipose tissue is like a sponge, right? So if you ate too much, you just threw more in there, right? Soaked up extra nutrients, and then if you started, if you're in a caloric deficit, you were losing weight. It just gave up some of its nutrients.

Speaker 2:          01:00:16       You know, like the guy who fasted for 365 days and didn't die because he had so much, so much fat. We now know that body fat fits every definition of a, of an inadequate system. It's a tissue. It is an actual organ because it sends out hormonal signals, it integrates hormonal signals, it talks to the brain, the Hindbrain, the arcuate nucleus is integrated in all of metabolism in a big way, and typically you have. The way we gain fat, lose fat is based on the fat cell size. So you have a set number of fat cells and the other expand, or they shrink pretty intuitive, unless now you can create more fat cells. If you become so obese that you literally can't stuff any more fat in there, right? So obese people have fat cell hyperplasia. A lot of times what's really interesting is people at the end of a diet when your, when your thyroid hormone is lower, your sympathetic nervous system tone is lower.

Speaker 2:          01:01:12       This unique hormonal. May Lou, if you overfeed to rapidly, there's a researcher named Mclean out of Colorado that actually showed that you can actually increase your fat cell number if you overfeed to rapidly right after a diet. Now, this was in rats, full disclosure, but it was fascinating stuff. Now you're increasing your body's, but it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective. Your body's like, shit, we had this famine. We don't want to deal with this shit again. We want to make sure that we can store as much stuff as possible, so we're going to create some new. This dude is rapidly overfeeding. We're going to create some new fat cells to make sure we're not going to miss any of this energy. We're going to capture every single bit of it.

Speaker 5:          01:01:51       I like what you're saying and it makes a lot of sense. You're talking about weight loss and weight gain, but you were specifically discussing hormonal changes in the body due to the ketogenic diet that are beneficial and that these hormonal changes and the changes to the way the brain functions would be a benefit of following that diet versus just working on calories.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       Yeah, I mean it's at that book I gave you the complete book of Ketones by Dr Marion.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       So, uh, so that, I don't think it's actually out yet because prep guide going to get jacked. So ketones are hints of Beta. There a, a, there are sort of, by definition have a metabolic superiority as a, as a fuel source, you know, and they readily cross the blood brain barrier. They can largely replace glucose as the primary energy source in your brain under periods of fasting a or ketogenic diet. So that, that offers a lot of advantages to someone dieting because it makes you resilient. Like the guy that fast at 382 days, his glucose was, was like 30 and dipped down the 20. That would be universally fatal for most people. But as ketones were elevated, so he did not feel hunger. So that, that is true. Like the Cahill Studies, George Cahill, a studies at Harvard medical school where they fasted subjects for 40 days, they injected insulin to increase what are, did two that I remember presenting this Atliens camp a while back.

Speaker 3:          01:03:23       Uh, and I, when I, you know, read this study, I had to call him on the phone, he was living, he passed away in 2012, but we had a number of conversations before he passed away and I was amazed that he got ethics approval to do that because it's basically like killing someone injecting 20 I use of insulin. But what was fascinating that they were asymptomatic for hypoglycemia at a level of hypoglycemia that's typically universally fatal. And they were also a very cognitively lucid. And that was a dramatic demonstration at the time it was thought that, you know, the brain could only use glucose. So this is a paradigm shift in the way, uh, we understand sort of fuel utilization and particularly in the brain, so that has major and I can go on and talking about the different applications of the Ketogenic Diet, which I did on the first podcast.

Speaker 3:          01:04:12       But from a perspective of someone dieting to lose weight dieting as a lifestyle, doing intermittent fasting, the key to genic diet makes intermittent fasting much easier because your brains adapted to it. That for me had tremendous, a practical applications that allowed me to excel through academia. I was able to do a lot more work, not get hungry. And uh, and you know, Lena, we haven't trained in a while, but when we train last night we did dead lifts. I mean we were doing both deadlifting six 75 for reps and I was on, actually, I was on the, the, uh, the classical ketogenic diet then that's when I was just doing it and it out to your school versus like an 80 to 90 percent fat. And I was doing that for about a year and um, you know, dead lifting like three times my body weight for, for Reps, you know, and it didn't hurt me. I can't say that would be the case for everyone, but I also titrated the calories in that I wasn't really at a calorie deficit. I lost a little bit of ways. So I guess by definition I was at a calorie deficit now for people that are

Speaker 4:          01:05:17       thinking about gains, trying to gain weight, they would think that the key to genic at that 80, 90 percent fat would not be enough protein. I believe that the ketogenic diet shines when you are in a calorie deficit. I, my mentor for the cancer work, Tom Seyfried had published a study showing an unrestricted ketogenic diet can actually promote cancer growth in a brain tumor model. Unrestricted meaning too much calories. Yeah. They were feeding mice a sugary at key to genic formula that was on the market at the time. Well, it was a sweetened. I'm sorry. It was sweet and cute. Agentic formula with hydrogenated fats and other things. Yeah, it was a, as sweetened with maybe with aspartame or something like that, so they might tend to overeat it and when they overeat it, you know, it creates a plethora of metabolic abnormalities and uh, you also get those same mountain rallies when you over eat carbs.

Speaker 4:          01:06:10       You didn't say, here's me being, just as a side note, how much does it drive you guys crazy when you hear about this fat acceptance thing or fat is healthy when you be fat. So much of this going around to massively obese people, they're trying to say it's okay, it's fine. You're your football players, right? I mean, by definition they're pretty healthy. I mean they, they lift, they train a metabolically, their bloodwork kind of looks okay, so you have guts, but they're not surprise you with my answer. Okay. Uh, so, uh, we talked about this earlier, I'll take the heat. I'm a libertarian, so if somebody says I'm fat and unhappy and I liked my life and I know what the risks are that I say, knock yourself out. I've ended up before the judge will make somebody else happy. But now the problem is if you complained about being fat, that you got to do something about it, otherwise you're not going to have any patients for.

Speaker 4:          01:07:01       That goes back to the discipline there, but you can be fit, but fat that you. Because you have morbidly obese people. Like I said, if you lose 10 percent of your body weight, there's overweight people who run marathons. Texture. Yeah. You can't tell me they're not in shape. Yeah, no, know for sure. It's just you're just carrying extra weight. I mean, look at Daniel Cormier. He's not obese. He's not obese, but he has some fat. Don't come get me down. I thought steep meo chick. He was more than 40 pounds over his fighting weight as a light heavyweight champion and he was actually heavier than steep a bay and serves the practical friend of mine. But yeah, but that is. The performance is not the same thing as aesthetics. Let me tell you what it meant to shape what I looked like. That I looked amazing. You felt like shit. I felt like shit ready to pass out. Literally for me to stand up was a. was I remember being on the couch and there was a stupid, some show on [inaudible] dot com. Uh, there was a stupid show on TV and the remote was, this goes back to neat. There was a remote over there, like five feet away. I sat and watched the whole show because I just didn't feel like getting the fucking remote. So isn't it ironic because you look so good, like when you jacked

Speaker 2:          01:08:15       like that, you look like you just fucking running forever breakthrough walls. Now there is a threshold, like you know, some of the Ray Williams who is the world's best power lifter. I mean he looks obese, dude squats legit 180 pounds. Isn't that an issue there with power lifter? So a good percentage of them carrying around a lot of body fat. It's not as much as you would think anymore like in the super heavyweight ts because like for example, the IPF, which is kind of the IOC recognized Power Lifting Federation that I compete in their cutoff for super heavy weights to 65. So if you're going to be a super heavyweight, might as well just be 3:50, you know, it was that Dude Jamie, that's ray as bets re re look at the bar bending. Dude, that's, he's a beast. He's a beast, right? Gentlemen, Super Nice Guy, a blind sumner, another one.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       But like when I sit my squat record of six 68 at 200, five pounds, I mean I was in pretty good shape for that, but for me to get to like eight percent body fat, no problem for me to get from eight percent and I'm calibrating. So for me to get to from eight percent to three percent, so fucking nightmare your body again. Really get down to three on. I think that would be if you floated. No, there are no actual, uh, accurate measures of body fat. That's the uh, that's why it's not really like the relatively within themselves. They're activists dependent upon hydration factors. Yes. So people, not to make too much of a side tangent, but people look at Dexa dual x Ray absorption technology and they say, oh, that's the gold standard. Texas actually really finicky. Like I remember Dec, seeing rats in studies that we do it in duplicate, so we do it twice and sometimes you'd have like differences just decorating the same rat twice.

Speaker 2:          01:10:00       It depends on the machine, your hydration status, because water, if you want to gain, you know what the best way to gain eight pounds of lean body mass within five minutes, go do a Dexa, then drink a gallon of water, go back to the next, another Dexa. You'll be eight pounds. Lean body mass heavier. You can impress your friends because it's the two compartment model. More lean body mass. It's a to compartment model. Same thing with calipers. It's only measuring your amount of fat tissue. So anything that's not fat is lean body mass. So if you guys are using that to track progress, if anybody use that to track progress, it's only accurate relative to the measurement. So your calipers me nothing for what your dexa measurements going to be and vice versa. I see it, but the change, like if I'm. If I'm calibrating a consistently at 10 percent and then it drops to eight and then seven and I can be relatively confident that I'm losing body fat, same thing for Dexa, but you have to do it at the same time of day, same hydration status, all of that kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:10:55       And I don't really use dexhub because people, in order to get an accurate, you'd have to use it like every day for it to be actual relative. You use pictures, right? So when he was dying and got to a certain way off tangent here, but I looked at him as, okay, yeah, like stop there. But then he would go for another and get to a level where

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       he looked very gaunt. I mean, you looked what looks good. They're like seeing him in person. Like I need this personality was changing. I mean, it's kind of Freaky, disgusting. Looking towards the end, uh, and many people who maybe follow the sport but don't compete, don't really realize what the difference between five percent or six percent and three percent is. So that separates the competitors from the. That's your Bros online. Really fighting evolution at that point because your body is trying to, your close to starvation, literally your body is trying to keep you from doing that, so like you think about food all the time, you actually become. So a friend of mine, Chris Foster, he's a professor at l a. He was doing his phd at the same time as me and him. My other friend Dr Jeremy Lin and Dr Lindy Russo, Chris's wife Chris was doing a contest prep, but I prepped him for the show and it was a six months study of He's a natural bodybuilder, so drug free and they looked at the hormonal responses, his weight, his body fat and even like measures of mood.

Speaker 4:          01:12:15       Chris is like the most. I was a beast like to 60 or I'm not a natural joy free by 2:20 in the off season, but one day he just looked like he, you know, he's a big guy, but he's like a very mellow dude by the end. His mood measurements. We're measuring like that of a psychopath. Really? Yeah. It just changes your mood around fighters who like they get when they get that lean, it's just like he could barely talk to you and we'll think about. Think about like they're actually trying to peak for a fight at the same time. They feel the most like shit. It's ridiculous. They're so focused on cardio they want to make to send to a. they're. They're focused on just dehydration and making that way. I've seen some of the protocols. I've. There's some good ones out there, but some of the stuff I've seen them like, God, I wish I could talk to somebody in that, in that realm because it's so.

Speaker 4:          01:13:01       It's so much bro. Science, it's so dangerous to. And it's. It's really, you can only do it three or four times and then your body starts to reject it and these guys have to go up and wait. Like you were talking about. Well, you explained to you why. Yeah, it. Guess what? What happens when they go up a weight? Sometimes they start crushing it. Do they do much better? So it's testosterone right? At plummeted, but his, his bazell requirements as calories department was like 1200. The crazy thing is I'm. So, there had been some critics of my, my kind of a view of metabolic adaptation. The body is self defense system, full full disclosure. Some people criticized me about that. They say, well, if you look at metabolic adaptation, it only explains it's only a 15 percent adaptation relative to the whole adaptation. And uh, but if you look at Chris's numbers, I think on average that's probably right on an average diet with an average person you take, somebody's trying to get really lean or somebody who jojo diets or somebody crash diets. And now you know, if again, it's proportionate. If you challenge your body with something extreme, it's going to respond in an extreme fashion. So every case study we have on natural bodybuilders and there's about 10 of them now who look at their contest preparation and coming out of it. And I use them to just because this is the realm I grew

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       up in, shows that they're hypogonadal by the time that they're at stage. So hypogonadal meaning their testosterone, their testosterone is clinically low. Yeah, naturally. And these are guys like me. I actually run. I actually have a pretty naturally high testosterone level. Like when every. Every time ever since I'm 16 years old, when I got tested, I've been like over 800. If I'm eating enough. When I was at contest, I was under 300. This is part of how your body fights you. Your body does not want you to be that lean, but if you're kind of raining this back into the discussion, this is why I talk about why it's so important to pick something that's sustainable for you as an individual. Because if you do this shit where you Yoyo Diet or you don't come out of it appropriately, it will fuck you up. I mean we've.

Speaker 2:          01:14:58       We've all females, especially in a lot of track record, like I, I've worked with a lot of females now because especially in physique sports, there's a lot of really bad coaching starvation diets than for women. It's, it just messes with their reproductive cycle to stop having peer mentors, which I'm going to and of itself doesn't seem to have necessarily what does that no menstrual cycle. So it doesn't necessarily end of itself, seemed to be a, um, have negative health consequences in terms of longevity or disease or anything like that. But yeah, I mean if you can't get pregnant, I mean that's a big deal for some women, but the women don't want to hear is you may have to gain some body fat to get that back. You know, they don't want to hear that. But this is why, like I really start with sustainability and then from there I go to, okay, what?

Speaker 2:          01:15:48       So if we've got what's sustainable for you now, can we get a little bit better? Can we do a little bit more fiber? Like I think in general, you know, I criticize Paleo diets because I think their validation for their model is absolutely fucking stupid. Oh, the kind of evolutionary validation and the fact that we didn't drink milk and we didn't eat beans in this kind of thing, but coffee. But the question shouldn't be what we were doing. The question should be what makes sense and what is healthy now. Like if you look at studies on dairy, almost all studies show people who take in dairy are healthier, better bone density, more lean body mass, lower body fat. But it isn't. Are there a lot of people that think that dairy is bad for you? Yeah. Here it causes inflammation. Megan's but early, uh, some, some, some, some like clean eaters to think that dairy somehow causes the, the research data. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:16:40       In dairy, uh, various proteins that a alpha locked albumin or that can basically initiate a, an immune response in the body. So I know when I'm okay with dairy fat, I can get like 100 grams a day of dairy fat. But if I'm, if I drink a whey protein shake, especially at night I wake up all congested and pure whey concentrate a way. Yeah, way concentrated or just like a, you know, a yogurt or, and, and I think it's a spectrum, right? So it's not like you have it or you don't. I think, you know, there's a spectrum and bovine protein is kind of viewed a foreign body. I mean once it enters the bloodstream it can.

Speaker 2:          01:17:25       It's only if it enters the blood stream because if digestion is working properly, you're not going to get any of that in the bloodstream. It's all going to be chewed up into some of the die and try peptides. Some of it makes, I mean like insulins have 15,

Speaker 3:          01:17:36       the amino acid and if you take enough insulin, like you can basically go hypoglycemic if you orally consume it. That's why you, I

Speaker 2:          01:17:44       think it's a, I think it's 81, 81 I thought. Oh well it doesn't matter. Sure. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So even something that's a 50 amino acids can get through this, this term lactose intolerance. Do you think that's actually resigning? That's actually sugar. Yeah. So this is an issue with people's individual dietary system. Some people have a alpha elect, albumin sensitive sensitivity where they, if they've got some kind of leaky gut. So normally your, your, your injunctions are tight. Okay. So your, your small intestine, your intestines are like kind of fingers and they pick up nutrients. This I'm really generalizing, but theo cells, the tight junction is a little little anchor that holds that gets loose, dysfunctional with that that can allow certain nutrients through the wall and that will initiate a bodies in loon response. Holly is a CELIAC and she. So if she has gluten it you will know it because she will have a huge inflammatory response.

Speaker 2:          01:18:44       But in people who have normal digestion, that just doesn't happen. Going back to the Paleo thing, what I was going to say is even though I. I disagree with their relevance, if you told me, okay, you take their general recommendations, eat limit sugar, eat more whole foods, eat higher protein. I think in general that's pretty good recommendations for most people. I just, as you said, I'm anti bullshit so I'm not going to let you make claims about why something works when that's not why it works. So when we look at like the differences in diets, like I think what I would say generally to pr people is that here's the great news as far as fat loss goes and health markers, if you want to lose weight, if you eat, if you control your calories, so a calorie deficit, you eat enough protein because protein helps spare lean body mass and is thermogenic so it increases your energy output and then you can kind of do whatever you want with carbs and fats and whatever you prefer and you'll still lose the same amount of weight and get about all the health benefits.

Speaker 2:          01:19:48       But it has to be something that you can sustain because if you can't sustain it, you're going to put all that weight back on. That's what the research data shows. So donald loves sustaining it, meaning for life balanced diet that you could stick with versus for life, some sort of a calorie deficit. That's really only a temporary thing to lose weight. Right? So now obviously you. You can't eat a deficit forever, right? Because then you would starve yourself to death. But the body corrects that. Like you, as you drop body weight, your metabolic rate slows down, you're not in a calorie deficit forever when we talk about losing weight and then maintaining it, right? So eating in a maintenance, so eating basically the behaviors you use in the style of dieting you use, you have to continue that if you want to maintain it. So if you like key to Janet, like you like key to genic, you liked you to genic mo and I think you're a big fan of meat.

Speaker 2:          01:20:40       If you can sustain that, you know, like people out there as, oh my God, people will probably tell you you're going to get cancer and you're going to do this and you're gonna do that. Most of those health benefits are just from not having excess body fat, excess body fat, and the metabolic dysregulation of a metabolic type syndrome. That's what cause 90 percent of these problems. Okay? Now, which is why I get crazy when people say that fat is healthy. Well, well here's the problem. It's like we, we have like reactionary culture. So we have been through your set point is to we have reactionary culture, so you see this all the time, so we had, okay, you've got to eliminate saturated fat, you gotta eliminate dietary fat and just eat grains and limit your proteins and we got fatter and so the reaction to that was don't eat any carbs.

Speaker 2:          01:21:29       Saturated fat isn't bad for you. In fact, eat as much saturated fat as you can. It's great. Put butter in your coffee like no, there's good data to show that the research data that I've seen in my opinion shows that saturated fat absolutely was demonized. It's not as bad as we thought, but it's if you eat too much of it, it's not great either, especially with carbohydrates. Oh absolutely. Because now you're increasing your. Now you're increasing your liver production of saturated fats as well, right? When your body gets into a fat burning stage, and then on top of that, you pile on carbohydrates, then your body wants to store those carbohydrates. As with the Calorie surplus, you actually technically you store the fats, you started because you carbohydrate, you burn the carbohydrates stored, right? So carbohydrate. If you say, well, why does, if you don't store Kobo, so I talk about this in my book because people will go too far to each direction to say, well, you said you don't.

Speaker 2:          01:22:23       You only use you hardly story. Any carbohydrate is actual fat. Why don't we eat zero fat and mostly carbohydrates? Well then your body, your body's not dumb, your body, we didn't. You didn't get here today and get through evolution in tens of thousand years of hard, you know, living by your body, being stupid so your body can ramp up Denovo, lipogenesis so that you can create fat from carbohydrate. If fat gets low in carbohydrate intake, gets high enough. Essential fatty acid. There was a research study or a med analysis done by Kevin Hall, who's an Nih researcher, and they showed that if you equate calories, you get a extra benefit from fat restriction versus carb restriction on fat loss. So you get about 26 grams extra fat loss per day. Calories equated a protein acquainted if you restrict fat versus carp. Now before everybody goes crazy. That's probably due to a little bit of inefficiencies in ramping up Denovo lipogenesis because there's.

Speaker 2:          01:23:26       It takes energy to move that system, but 26 grams of fat loss per day to me is not a physiological like, I don't care about that. That's nothing compared to, okay, if you like low car better, don't worry about losing extra 26 grams of fat if you like glow car better and you can sustain that, then do low carb. One of the things that we seem to be getting into here is the difference between losing weight and optimal performance and then optimal performance mentally hormonally versus optimal performance physically in terms of like athletic, athletic pursuits. So here's, here's something else

Speaker 3:          01:24:02       type of person, whether it's, you know, you don't want to put a a teenager that's playing football on a ketogenic diet necessarily. Why would that be? Well, maybe if they were overweight, that could be beneficial, but I think it would decrease his performance unless he goes through the Keto adaptation phase, but there's a lot of the. At when you're a teenager, you're I would say your carbohydrate tolerance is very high. I want to do. I want to adjust this. For My, my mind was very high. I could eat huge plates of pasta that I could not eat now. I just simply couldn't. So I think as we age, I would say our carbohydrate tolerance decreases with age because our metabolic machinery is not as hungry for glucose. I mean we're set up and hormonally our insulin sensitivity is not as high. Glycolytic pathways are reduced, things like that that happens as a consequence of age, so it makes sense that as we transition into age for longevity and for health span, maybe not lifespan, but health span, a carbohydrate restriction makes sense. And even in some cases the key to genic diet makes sense. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:25:09       but if you look at the, okay, so I have to push backs on that and I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you. I kind of am. But if you look at longevity data, the actual longevity Davao people who restrict fat versus carbs live longer. Like that's what a new study that came out showed. But again,

Speaker 3:          01:25:27       I'm describing it as also a means of of because people put on weight as they age, we're the low carb and with the ketogenic diet, that becomes a practical strategy to create a sustainable calorie deficit for losing weight. Sustaining that, and also if you elevate ketones over time, a lot of the new research that's coming out, you know, over the last five years, ketones is not just a superior source of energy metabolically, but it also has epigenetic effects on the body. It activate gene pathways that can confer resistance against oxidative stress, that longevity pathways, anti inflammatory pathway in the context of a deficit. No, not in the context of deficit. You could feed ketones, take a ketone supplement, and it activates a, just simply elevating Beta hydroxybutyrate functions as a histone deacetylase inhibitor and can activate a, if you will, a gene programs that can confer resistance against many different things, uh, oxidative stress pathways, and also activate or suppress and inflammatory pathway that's linked with many age related chronic diseases and autoimmune pathways. It decreases the activation of the NLRP three inflammasome. So

Speaker 2:          01:26:43       what about people living longer? You're talking about that epidemiology study that was like a questionnaire or people what they ate over a long period of time. Highly criticized studies and there's a lot of co founders, which is why I'm not as hard to say. It's hard to say that the study shows that if you eat carbs versus fat that you, you live. I didn't say one was causing effect, sort of cited in a piece of evidence because I don't cherry pick because if we're going to give the argument I want to give the whole argument. I was playing devil's advocate. I don't think that necessarily, uh, if you eat a low carb diet, it's going to cause you to live a shorter life. I don't believe that, but I think it's important to put all the data out there because what I see a lot of is people just cherry picking and I will pose those with those studies they get. They become co founders and everybody will say, you know, eat carbs. You live fat. Diets are going to kill you. And then it just gets crazy. Here's the wire.

Speaker 3:          01:27:38       Some of the animal work. I mean, Lena and I both did animal work. I think some of the animal work is almost more reliable because you have an inbred strain of animal and you have very tight control if you have genetically identical, freely living human, you know, he's doing many different things and there's genetic variability, uh, but with animals that it may not always be predictive. It's informative, but not always predictive. And I think some of the, the data, I read some of the human studies and become a more confused, but going back to the animal data, I'm almost more comfortable with some of these outcomes for animal studies. So

Speaker 2:          01:28:15       one thing I want to bring up that I think is really important is we have, I think we're all getting to this point and people out there think that there's like this perfect diet that's going to cure everything. And all of our ails. The fact, the uncomfortable truth in the fact of the matter is that if one diet is an. I don't know this specifically, but my guess is if one diet is a better for cancer, it might be worse for heart disease. Or if one diet is better for insulin resistance, maybe it's worse for cancer, it's better for cognitive performance, it might be worse, we don't, we don't know yet. So that's kind of where is your space at now? And this is why I go back to those big picture things of most of the health benefits. Just come from having more muscle.

Speaker 2:          01:28:58       Lift weights, lift weights. If you're, if you're debating about diets and you're not lifting weights, you are fucking missing the point because that is. Sorry I curse a so that I do it on twitter. You've seen me. So, uh, it's very good at emphasizing your point. Yes. So, um, I'm a fan of it. Awesome. Fucking awesome. So, uh, somebody criticized me for one day. I was like, you know, what's great about my job? I can say fuck as much as I want and nobody's going to fire me. So that is great. Um, but the big picture things, lift weights, create more lean body mass, be active. That's a huge thing. Even if you're overweight, if you're active, you're, you're gonna live fine. But on the whole, you're going to live longer than the person who's inactive and then control your weight, so if you can even see if you can get to a normal weight and maintain it or sorry, normal body fat and maintain it, or if you're a high body fat, if you can get to a lower body fat and maintain it.

Speaker 2:          01:29:55       Nice. That's 90, 95 percent of the battle. All this other stuff is five percent that we're worrying about that we're going back and forth about. And that's why I don't want to miss the context because when people like, uh, I'll pick on him because he was who asked for it. Gary Taubes. But I'm happy. I'm happier we got done for this. But I'm going to just interject. Hey God, wait, wait. When people like Gary Taubes say things like carbs or are causing obesity, just carbs, you create this problem where if people don't like eating high fat diet or a low carb diet and they can't sustain it, they just feel like they're a big failure and they just quit. Because what's the point? If carbs are causing fat and I can't stop eating carbs, what am I going to have a real hard problem with? I know what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          01:30:42       Discipline. It's important or this nonsense, but I think my point is that if you give people flexibility, it usually improves adherence. Right? And you're talking about from your point of view, coaching people. Right? And what I would like to see is I would like to see a diet that's protein and calorie controlled study, protein calorie controlled. If anybody knows of one that has done this, let me know. Protein and calorie controlled and then let people self select higher carb, higher fat. What do you prefer? Let them self select and see how well they do. And I bet you would see improvements in adherence in both groups.

Speaker 3:          01:31:17       Dom, you were going to. Well, I think a diet strategy that controls your appetite and does not have your appetite controlling you. Uh, which I think is accomplished with a ketogenetic diet. That's also one that's a well formulated. One that's controls, you know, that has fiber and adequate protein. A is a strategy that allows you to be far less fixated on food, uh, because you're not as hungry and you can decrease your meal frequency. So if there's, I know there's people out there that are busy people, ceos of companies, uh, students or whatever, uh, that simply do not have time to prepare and eat a meals too when they get hungry. So by reducing meal frequency you can increase your productivity and I think you're kind of coaching your body to be a better fat burning. I think there's definitely benefits. So when you are on a ketogenic diet, you are storing more fat but you are burning more fat.

Speaker 3:          01:32:17       So think about your adipose tissue as little bags which have fat coming into them and fat leaving them and the fat oxidation pathways or elevated. And when I eat a ton of fat at night before I go to bed, I am like some people carb load. I'm like fat loading at night and I'm pulling off those fat stores during the day through my adolescence. Uh, I think about it like that. So instead of just, you know, carbing up at nighttime and I tend to, I would wake up hungry, I would probably dump insulin and then wake up with a hypoglycemic cravings in the middle of the night if I did that time restricted eating a, yeah. Like today, like I'm fasting and, and most days that I want to be as productive as possible. I will not have my first meal which will be typically a ketogenic meal around 4:00 PM.

Speaker 3:          01:33:03       And what time to eat at night? Uh, I will start, I'll do a small meal like at work and then I'll eat my big meal at about 7:00, maybe 7:00 and then snack throughout the night and maybe eat within, you know, I started eating at 4:00 PM and I finished eating and about 10:00 PM. So you basically start eating at the end of your day. Yeah. So, and that's very liberating for me. So. And I didn't even know this was possible, but that's like back 10 years ago, I didn't know it was possible to have that amount of control over my appetite and actually feel as lucid and as energetic and be able to, you know, uh, get with lane and do deadlifts with him and actually maintain my, my performance and my strength in the gym. I don't feel like I'm an outlier either.

Speaker 2:          01:33:48       I think it's possible. So I think that anecdotes are good because anecdotes calls us to look at things. But I can tell you like, um, so for example, I usually four times a day, uh, and I protein right now I'm in a gaining phase, so I'm trying to purposely gain weight. Hopefully some lean body mass. I'm coming back from an injury. So trying to regain some weight, lean body mass. I'm eating about 400 to 450 grams of carbohydrate today. Um, there were times when I'll go seven, eight hours, I won't eat and I don't really get hungry. So, I mean, there's 16 hours. Uh, I don't. Uh, I dunno, I dunno, but I don't think I would. I go some some nights I'll sleep and I'll wake up and I'll go 12 slash 13 hours, like I'll go in sometimes and, and I don't usually get hungry now, but again, that's just think that is just a, well, if you look at some of the things that all disagree with or are the idea that insulin has these big fluctuations and you become hypoglycemic and that causes over feeding. In some people that's the case, but most people, if they're eating a, especially with a higher protein diet, that doesn't usually happen. I want

Speaker 3:          01:34:55       to add that the population, most people are

Speaker 4:          01:34:57       not bodybuilders and the population of, of people that lean mostly communicates with our on the border of being metabolically elite and also have a very high carb tolerance. If you're a bodybuilder with a large amount of lean body mass, you are pretty much metabolically set up to be a very, have a high carb tolerance so that the general population is not like that. So let's talk about Clark polaroids because I, that's one thing that will disagree on. I don't think that people are more, uh, less carb tolerant. I think that people have sought slower and faster metabolic rates. So if you have a faster metabolic rate, you'll be more tolerant by default because you could just tolerate more calories. I agree with. But in a bodybuilder that's 220 pounds on average, on average. Yep. Now, if you look at somebody who's on a ketogenic diet, they're actually by definition of carb tolerance, there are carbohydrate intolerant because if you challenge them with a Bolus of glucose, when they click, they can't clear it.

Speaker 4:          01:35:55       So, but that, that doesn't, that's just because what they're adapted to. Right. But there are fat adapted. Yeah. Great. Great. So I actually, uh, the first experimental biology we ever went to, this is why, you know, even scientists get this shit so wrong sometimes because again, they get so in their echo chamber, they don't bother to look outside of it going to the gym when we first met and went lane stopped and had a huge meal, which to me, I was like, you feel like doing or we're going to stop and eat pizza for I go squat. It's a real heavy fatty meal. Visit the bathroom about five times. But you know, I didn't, I forgot, I think I did eat, but it was very abnormal for me to go eat a meal heavy meal on the way that Jim, holly's like you, she, she hates training, fed.

Speaker 4:          01:36:36       She wants to be fast and she feels better that way. But that's the individual differences, right? That's the individual differences. Part of it. Part of it may be you're just adapted to that as well and what you're used to. So maybe a psychological thing, but some people may just do better that we're blood is diverted to your digestive system and processes and that's less blood for the muscle. So you're, you're expending energy to digest breakdown. Then similarly is that there has been pretty debunked. Really? Yeah. But something happened. I mean it's just a fundamental. You've got a logical concept that you are diverting blood resource to, to a particular job of a scientist is to question even those theories we hold most to be true. Neil degrasse Tyson says, yeah, but it, it's. So I think a small meal actually it can be beneficial, but it's not like you're using Mongo hydrates during the meal.

Speaker 4:          01:37:28       You're not using the product. And how has it been debunked that they see that performance isn't worse and that you don't like is the performance specifically. There's not a limitation of blood flow because you've eaten something to the muscle. There's not a limitation of blood flow to the muscle. Um, but again, some people just do better if they're faster or have small meals. Again, it may be a psychological thing, but I like to feel like I've had a lot of food and I'm fully fueled for a long training session, but some people will feel kind of training. No, like if you're doing something like squats in a very controlled, but if you were doing something like it might be different. Yeah, if you were doing Jujitsu, but I don't know, you would probably throw up. Maybe. I don't know. I, I did it very briefly.

Speaker 4:          01:38:13       Awesome sport. Like I did it very briefly, informally. Also really can't have a big meal and then go train and get fucked up. I'd probably have gone to the bathroom every few minutes. I can't work on a grant. I can't. I'm not supposed to talk about guns, but mean if I go to the range and it's supposed to have guns. My. Let's talk about guns. When you talk. We talked a lot before. My groups are tighter, I can better control and if I go in in a fed state, I'm just not as focused as that. My vision, my vision is not as acute in the right after a big meal as if I'm fast at 16 hours, but this is, this is the hard thing with anecdote because we can't tease out whether or not that's. That is an actual physiological thing or whether you just feel better and you think you'll do better so you do better because the brain is unbelievably powerful.

Speaker 4:          01:38:57       There was a study and um, I may butcher it because I can't remember it exactly, but they took people who had legit allergy problems and they gave them a sugar pill and they said this will improve your allergies. It should not have done anything. Over half the people reported their symptoms got better and 30 percent actually physiologically got better because their brain was telling them get better. Like it's pretty crazy. So that's part of probably the best diet for you might be the Diet you can stick to and just feel real positive about. Right. Because you feel like this might be someone what's going on with a lot of this low carb stuff that people say they feel so fantastic because there's some sort of a placebo effect that's possible. I think part of it is too is that's why animals studies are given me more confidence when I can look at rats or mice on a ketogenic diet and see and objectable, you know, objective increase or decrease in a parameter.

Speaker 4:          01:39:53       Then I gained confidence. But here's the thing. I'm not saying that that's a bad thing. If you feel good about it, that's great, but just don't try to get on twitter and tell everybody all you're going to gain fat in a deficit because you're eating carbs right up. If you go to a witch doctor and you really believe it might actually help you, yes. One of the, one of the number one characteristics of cancer survivors is that they're actually. They have a belief in God. They believe that they're going to make it through that. Now, some people cause or effect. Some people will argue religious people will argue, well, they believe in God and so God is helping them. The other argument to that is they believe that they are going to make it through there and so they have a moral, a better likelihood of doing it, so your brain is believe in the ketogenic diet and believe in God and I think that's a great thing and that day they have remarkable. I believe that you know, well, I, I, I'm a person of faith, but I also believe that if you have faith in the methodology to the patients

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       that have communicated with me that actually believed that this approach is gonna work and then they reached that actual therapeutic state of ketogenetic diet have results that kind of defy what you would expect scientifically. So I believe it's working physiologically and also psychologically there is immuno psycho therapy, right? Or immunology. So our brain can actually control many different physiological processes including our immune system and that that is something that's under appreciated and under studied and that really needs to be studied in terms of eating a large meal before training. Surely your body has to use up some of the resources to digest. You don't think that it's blood flow to the muscle.

Speaker 2:          01:41:39       Well, it's been debunked. They show that the blood flow to the muscle is not limiting. If you've had a meal before you train. Okay. Now the thing is, but some people don't like that. It's a very individual thing. It probably, it may be a psychological thing with me. I'm not, I'm not. I understand that I'm an idiot like everybody else out there, right? So I'm subject to bias and a psychological influence like anybody else, but I just used that to my advantage. If I feel good about it, why would I not do it? Now, if you train in the morning, do you do that? Like heading to the gym first thing in the morning? Holly tries to stop me because then I usually end up going to the bathroom for like five times, but um, I'll eat a little bit less in the morning if I'm, if I'm going to go straight in and train.

Speaker 2:          01:42:26       Uh, but one of the things that, that going back that so many scientists miss is that context, like most people miss context, but scientists, even ms dot context. So the first experimental biology study or first experimental biology symposium we ever went to, there was a poster where they fed people a ketogenic diet or they fed them a high carb diet and then at the end of six weeks they challenged them with 100 grams of glucose and looked how long it took for them to clear that glucose. The ketogenic diet people would have been worse than type two diabetics at clearing glucose. Okay? Whereas people eating a high carb diet cleared it just fine. Right now if you, if you just looked at these numbers as Dr. Oh my God, you're diabetic. No, that's what they were adapted to and I challenged the person with the poster I said, and he, for all you kidogenic diet people who hate me on twitter, I defend the Akita, didn't it? When it is time to be defended, I said to the girl, if you had fed a high fat meal to these people, you would have seen the same thing in reverse. If you would have fed a high fat meals, people who are out of the ketogenic diet and then a high carb diet, you would have seen really elevated triglycerides, ldl cholesterol, ldl cholesterol, Calabar, Crohn's, and people who were carpet acted because it wasn't being cleared because that's not what you're adapted to. But people miss that whole context is a

Speaker 3:          01:43:48       good analogy in his book. That book where if you have a, a, a factory, military factory that's making planes and then it has to switch over to making a ship's right, so you, it takes a lot of time to change sort of all the processes that take place. Uh, and the same thing as sort of happening. I mean, you're giving your body a different fuel source. So it has to ramp up the enzymatic machinery, the pathways, the regulatory pathways and the transporters even to basically use those fuels. Yeah. And the misunderstanding of that, or at least an ignorance as one of the more frustrating things online when I hear like nonsense people, these Internet air quote experts talking about the negative aspects of the key to genic dye that they tried it and they felt weak. Like, what do you mean you tried it, you tried it for a day.

Speaker 3:          01:44:36       Do you try it for three days? You got it for a month. Like, get the fuck Outta here. You can. Yeah. It's important. Like when, when you review a study and um, I think you have a study in your book actually that shows in the gym. You basically say the key to genic diet can hurt your performance in the gym. So, and you reference a race walking study where I think they did the key to genic diet for like three weeks or something like that. So, uh, I think we came back around and said that it's probably fine once you're adapted to it, once you're adapted to it, what's the time period we're talking about? For me, I did not feel myself after it took me about three to four months. But then you've got to realize that there's a learning curve to doing the Ketogenic Diet.

Speaker 3:          01:45:17       Right. So if I go back to my notes, uh, I mean my performance in the gym and just general wellbeing took about three to four months. Do you use an app to a child or anything? I did a my fitness pal and stuff, but I just know I'm a creature of habit so we basically just buy the same food all the time and I can, I measure things on scales and stuff just as a scientist so I can look at some powder on a scale and do 250 milligrams or minus, you know, 10, 10 milligram. So I, I've measured things out to where I can look at a plate and basically give you. The macro is pretty tight and that's, I don't know if you do that or have you ever done Quito for long periods of time? I've done it before. Yeah. And he hasn't been Keto adapted though.

Speaker 3:          01:46:00       I would argue that the ketones in my life, but I just wanted to do it for about eight weeks. So you could argue that I didn't do it long enough, but my thing is like, all my blood markers are healthy. Um, I didn't see. So I did Quito at maintenance and I didn't see really much improvement in anything. Everything kind of stayed the same. Now. What, what different energy when, when was this, what year was this? Would've been probably after my bodybuilding show before I got back into powerlifting. So it would have been some in like 2012. Did you like post about it? And so I want to go back because I didn't, I didn't want to really like get the wrath of anybody on me at the time trying it. Now I'm old and can take a rest. I just don't care that much anymore. But um, I didn't live performance. Didn't go down that in the first few weeks it did. But then it was fine.

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       I just like the flexibility of having some carbs. Yeah. I liked having that flexibility because if you it popcorn, I remember. Yes I do. If you know popcorn is great though because they see as higher protein and higher fiber. But you know, if, if I was going to commit to it as a lifestyle, then that will be fine, but unless you're willing to, again, if that's not something you're willing to stick to for life, you have to rethink if you're wanting to do it or not benefiting going on and off ketogenic diets. Correct.

Speaker 3:          01:47:22       I, so if you do a key to genic diet and you want to stay in a state of Ketosis, the days that I do intermittent fasting now, which I didn't do like five years ago, I don't necessarily do the key. I do a high higher protein, low carb, but my macros or not key to genic typically not all the time. Sometimes they are, but there are different. Like you could do intermittent fasting with a car based diet and still get ketones. You know, by the end of your fast. You could do low carb ketogenic. I actually think it's a little bit better to be metabolically flexible. So I'll throw in. I tend to eat a lot of vegetables and then throw in some fruits to have a few days a week where a, it may kick me out of Ketosis, but during the middle of the day when I need to be at my best, I pretty much always I'm running low to moderate ketones during the day and I can do that with different strategies now you know, with my body, because as much as I kick you out ptosis though, I kind of. That's at nighttime, a lady and a half of a dark chocolate. One or two things of dark chocolate and a which is maybe 15, 20 grams of carbs and maybe a half cup of blueberries and then a big salad and some vegetables. Typically

Speaker 2:          01:48:34       green vegetables. When you say kicked you out of Ketosis, so if you measure your blood, your ketones dropped below what level?

Speaker 3:          01:48:40       A point five and I typically don't even measure at night, but I wake up in the morning and I might be about point five and then that goes up throughout the day. So the middle part of the day, I'm typically running one between one to two, sometimes three milli moles. The urine strips are only effective in the early stages of Ketosis. Is that correct? Yak because in the beginning you spill out a lot of ketones in your urine, but as you increase ketone transport and utilization over time, less of them end up in your urine. How much time does that, uh, depends on the person. But after about two or three weeks, you may see less of a color change on the urine strips, even if you didn't change your diet. Is there another effective method other than the pricking the finger? Yeah. Well, uh, I think the blood, uh, you know, Abbott Labs makes the uh, precision Xtra.

Speaker 3:          01:49:31       There's the Quito Mojo, which I also use. We use in the lab with a Quito Mojo is a blood measurement and glucose measurement device. That's essentially a because Abbott cornered the market, they, uh, they basically allow you to check your ketones for a dollar a strip instead of, you know, three or $4 or $5, but it's still pricking your finger, pricking your finger. I don't use the dove, I actually use a syringe and just take a running, start in, jab my finger now because it doesn't get calluses like you do on your fingers. So knowing a, yeah, I'm Kinda used to it, but uh, the, the urine strip is actually pretty good relative marker and the uh, Siemens a multistage sg, we'll measure ketones and then nine other things like that measure kidney function and, and you know, your blood glucose and things like that. So I recommend that it's twenty five cents a strip and then there's the breath, a key tonics meter.

Speaker 3:          01:50:25       You blow into it and it measures breath acetone and uh, the level is also another breath acetone measurement system. Ask about that. So yeah, and you know, breath, acetone highly correlates the fat oxidation. So if your breath, acetone is high, you are burning a lot of fat. So I sit there an issue with people that are key in the state of Ketosis and they get pulled over for drunk driving. A couple of lawyers contacted me. There's some cases going on right now and they wanted me to weigh in on that breathalyzers because of the, what'd you say? Acetone breath is. It uses the same technology, a breath acetone, and if you, I know that if you drink alcohol and do a breath ketone meter, you can kind of pin it depending on what meter you're using. If you're using a breath for breath, ketone meter, if you're using, if you have a breath, uh, alcohol measurement and you're in a state of Ketosis, I have not seen that. Depending on the device that you'll have a false positive. If that's your question, uh, some devices can, it depends on the device.

Speaker 2:          01:51:31       So one thing I'll bring up because you said, well, you work with these kinds of metabolically elite people. So one of the problems I say what you're doing, where you kind of take yourself up to the point where you're sort of getting out of ketosis and then going back in, that's probably fine, but most people aren't going to do it that way. They're going to be like, oh, I had a cheesecake, or oh, I couldn't take it anymore. And I had pizza, whatever, that's really bad. So you see progress,

Speaker 3:          01:51:57       really, people who intermittent fast decrease that window time and overconsume on. Yeah. So that, that's a big problem. So

Speaker 2:          01:52:04       actually I wanted to bring up intermittent fasting too because I think again, like if you. So the studies on intermittent fasting show that um, you lose the same amount of calories are the same, you lose same amount of weight, same by the fat, maybe might be at risk for a little bit more lean body mass loss just because you're attributing protein synthesis left less often. But uh, you do have a little bit lower insulin levels it seems like now whether or not that's again beneficial based on the research that we talked about, unlikely insulin sensitivity, insulin sensitivity was a little bit better again. So there are some techniques you can do, but people bring up things like a typology and inflammation. And again, I kind of get um, the soil, if you, if you just calorically restrict, you increase autophagy and you increase, you decrease inflammation. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:52:55       you don't get an autophagy is dependent upon the decrease in certain amino acids. Glucose and insulin and you achieve those biomarkers states at a more significant level doing intermittent fasting and then you would and they are the autophagy regulate. Can you send me the, the the reason I am amp amp kinase leucine, so if you're eating various meals throughout the day three times a day, like you know your blood leucine levels will be

Speaker 2:          01:53:26       you gotta keep it in context of 24 hours. So people, people do this with fat storage and oxidation as well. They say, well, if you're, if you're fasting all this time, you're burning so much body fat. Well yeah, but then by definition if you're eating less at these times, you have to eat more at this time. If you're keeping calories the same and so during that time post-meal you're going to store a lot more fat. You're going to have much higher insulin now, maybe not. Maybe lower overall

Speaker 3:          01:53:53       metabolism. You're overshooting and those calories have to go.

Speaker 2:          01:53:57       So point being over 24 hours. You don't see differences in fat loss or fat gain. Intermittent fasting versus non. I would be interested in the inflammation stuff and the autophagy stuff because again, caloric restriction in of itself increases or decreases inflammation increases a tough to. Interestingly enough, one of the sugar studies they did with with higher sugar, with still calorically restricted, they showed decreases in inflammation. So inflammation is largely an issue of caloric restriction or excess. As you guys think that that's what's going on with this carnivore diet. Yeah, the people, it's hard now. I think it's a calorie restriction. In fact, it's hard to look at. If I give you a plate of French fries, like 200 grams of French fries, you can get a lot of calories from that. If I gave you 200 grams of meat, even a real fatty meat, it's not nearly the same like you, you're going to be much more satiated from the protein.

Speaker 2:          01:54:53       Like you can only eat so much meat, you know. And uh, again, like if you, I don't want to go too far down the carnivore diet whole, but the stuff I see with people yet, do I think you can eat meat and improve your blood markers? Absolutely. Absolutely. Of course you could eat pop tarts and now, but, but the point is, is like when we get into this kind of it have only eat meat. You don't need vegetables, you know, this, I mean again, it's epidemiology, but there's some really tight men analyses that have been done looking at colorectal cancer and low fiber intake. And I would not be comfortable recommending people not eat enough vegetables and fiber.

Speaker 3:          01:55:36       I feel uncomfortable eating a steak or a burger without something like Broccoli or a salad. I think you negate

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       many of the potentially carcinogenic compounds that are in red meat. Uh, and that's a whole nother debate. But I think eventually, yeah, he admired and, and uh, polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Chris Kresser actually brought that up yesterday talking about meat consumption with vegetables, like, with brought cruciferous vegetables, Broccolis in Salads. Like I don't personally would not eat red meat. So full disclosure, I mean I was, cause I get accused on twitter of being a car guy and I'm not. I was live research was funded by the egg board, the beef beef, a national beef something or another. Sorry guys. And then the national dairy council, so you know, full disclosure, by the way all you guys out there who again, you're just taking my word for it, but who think that like industry is this evil thing that comes in and controls everything. I met one person in my entire phd from the funding sources and I met them for literally 30 seconds.

Speaker 4:          01:56:44       They were at a uh, it was an experimental biology and they said hi, thanks for. Thank you for the grant. Oh Great. Great. Great job. Thank you. That was it. Now I'm not saying that there isn't nefarious things that can happen, but like when I heard when I like the show would Nina, everything was about who funded it and this and that and, but that's why they have to disclose those things on papers. And also this is why scientists, science is self regulating because somebody is going to repeat your study and if they don't find the same thing you found you're gonna be in trouble. So I get criticized for conflict of interest. I've seen it on social media and things. So I should probably say I am not a medical doctor or even a registered Dietitian and a phd scientists, so don't take my word is medical or nutrition advice.

Speaker 4:          01:57:29       Uh, we do. Our research is funded not only by the Department of Defense and Office of navy research, but also by companies that actually develop ketone food products and also exogenous ketone supplements. And our university owns the rights to those patents. I don't have any products myself or come. We have a company, ketone technologies and Quito nutrition has the information website, but at this time we have no products but the university licenses our intellectual property and products are made out of that. And I get patent royalties and I put the patent royalties back into our research. So buying various exogenous ketones, uh, products that are on the market can come back and help support the science and the application of this for him. I don't, I, you know, I tend not to state that, but I get called out for not stating that. So I think it's important to vouch for him because he's actually writing a chapter in my new book.

Speaker 4:          01:58:26       So we're going to have a chapter about the ketogenic diet if you're going to do it, this is how to do it right. So the new book, fat loss forever, shameless plug, 'em, and he said, I just want all the money that I make from the book to go back into the lab. So Nice. Like that's Walter Longo has a similar with prolon with his line too. I know his profits. He, you know, the profits that he takes, he puts back into research is unbiased. Anybody that says there are is full of crap. We all have our biases. We all have things that we think work better. Another. Sure. But I think the fundamental, if you, if you meet a scientist, and hopefully I equip myself well in this and I think dom does as well, is that one, you have an open mind but not so open that your brain falls out and to you care more about getting the right answer than being right.

Speaker 4:          01:59:14       When I went to do my phd, I was eating eight meals a day. I was eating 300 grams of protein a day. I was looking for more reasons to eat more protein and eat it more frequently when I left my phd, four meals a day and a little bit less protein and less frequently. And your fractory to the phenomenon. We're always eating 500 grams of protein a day. I was eating like two or three, two pound London broils and washing it down with a product metrics with hmb and it like in between meals back in the mid [inaudible] 90 [inaudible] and that was the coolest thing. It. Well actually that was the coolest thing about my research was it changed the way I actually changed the way I responded, but I was, I. That was my bias coming in, but I said, I looked at the research data.

Speaker 4:          01:59:59       I'm like, either I believe this or I don't, and if I believe this I can't justify x, Y, Z. can I get. Can I go back to the epidemiology studies in regards to colon and rectal cancer? There really haven't been any studies on people that just eat meat though, right? You're talking about people who eat meat on a regular basis and that usually is the standard American diet, a lot of other bullshit and their sugar bonds and there's tons of the co founders. Absolutely right. I would be fascinated to see some sort of long term studies on someone who's on a very strict carnivore diet. I'm really fascinated by this because I'm seeing all these people have all these benefits, but I am skeptical. Hippo face every step of the way. I'm like, I'm not know. Again, if it's allowing them to create a caloric restriction.

Speaker 4:          02:00:45       Right, and somebody says, you know what? I've tried every other diet out there. I've tried to eat high fiber and I've tried enough vegetables. I kept, but I can stick to this and I can create and I can lose some fat. Then I want to say, okay, well maybe that's the best diet for you. Well, I just know so many people that are benefiting from it, like a, you know, and, and not just a part of that on the podcast. So far I know a lot of other people and if the members followed by a doctor and collecting blood work along the way, I mean those doctors can write case reports so I'd be glad to assist in a, in a case report of people are tracking all their blood markers and doing there, but most of the people aren't though. That's what's going on.

Speaker 4:          02:01:20       Most of these knuckleheads are just eating meat and saying they feel great and well there's a war on vegetables. Like fucking very strange. Remember that people don't discount psychology. People are feeling very positively about it because it's the flavor of the month. Yeah. Like, and I have no hate towards carnivore. I don't know who the. I think Dr Baker Zombie one big guy. Um, but you know, like if I eat hot dogs, eat grass. I mean my dogs go out and eat around the grant, you know, to get some cat cats are obligate carnivores. Yeah. So cats interestingly are one thing that yeah, they don't. There is a carb tolerance within. They don't tolerate them well. They'll become obese. But the Vegan cat. So the, the. I think the thing is that I'm not, I don't believe in any one diet. I'm not trying to sell anyone dot, I would like to sell you on a ketogenic diet.

Speaker 4:          02:02:16       I really want to see you do it for like four or five months just to see if you're experiencing the same benefits as him. Pretty obvious that you really haven't done it like whole hog. I agree with that. Totally. And I think I could probably put together a meal plan, Quito, cookies and things like that. Where you thinking cookies. My cookies. I did. I technically like, hang on, hang on. See? I did a ketogenetic diet and it was fine. I felt fine about two months. Didn't stuff suffer that much? What was your blood markers? They didn't really change a whole lot like I had. I think some, I would consider them insignificant changes. I maintained um, about your millimoles. My melanoma. Do Urine Ketones, blood ketones or did you look at my blood? I didn't. I didn't measure those. Oh, okay. I just am your instincts.

Speaker 4:          02:03:04       And what stage were you in from moderate to high in terms of would have been the modified ketogenic diet. So I would have been not super, but I would have been barely ketosis. Yeah, I would have been above point Tom Wednesday. So he's eight weeks into it and that's about the point I was kinda feeling crummy and stuff. But. So, uh, so I actually ended up three, well not crummy, but I cognitively, it was kicking in. Yeah. But I was a political flag and the gym and then it started to fill out and then it's a learning curve too. Right. Let's see. My thing was, if I can get the same, if I can get the same benefits just by restricting my calories and keeping higher protein, same fence in terms of cognitive function, in terms of. Okay, well that's science. I would say. I mean we study, you could look at pub med, everything from polycystic ovary syndrome to acne, you know, type two diabetes, type one diabetes.

Speaker 4:          02:03:58       Now that's a little bit controversial, a genetic metabolic Migraines, you know, a whole host of neurological disorders simply because Beta hydroxybutyrate is, I believe sort of from there is an objective truth that it's a superior metabolic fuel and if, how do you define nearly molar levels in your blood, that's a significant amount of energy in your blood that your tissues can use. How are you defining severe metabolic fuel? The objective of the Delta g of ATP hydrolysis in the heart is enhanced. So essentially you're making more ATP for a given amount of oxygen, just protecting your metabolic rate could be slower. Uh, maybe you are

Speaker 3:          02:04:39       efficient. Yeah, so you're more metabolically efficient potentially, but I don't think in the context of fat loss, but it's also enhancing insulin sensitivity and simply feeding ketones. A independent of carbohydrate restriction increases fat oxidation in the muscle. Those had been published. There's bits, there's been studies to look at like a ketogenetic diet versus a knowledge eugenic higher carb diet, and they show that basically by going kidogenic you reduce overall insulin area under the curve by 20 percent. That was the number they got. Now, if I was type one diabetic, I would 100 percent do the kidogenic diet. One hundred percent. Absolutely. Okay. That this is not controversial. This is not medical, this is not medical advice. And me personally, I actually, when I used to give talks, I would say for these things, but if you're a type one diabetic, you want to avoid the ketogenic diet as much as possible because there's diabetic, something called Diabetic Ketoacidosis, but that's like my student Andrew Cute neck at USF as if you've also got a lot of insulin.

Speaker 3:          02:05:37       He has a blog on Keto nutrition.org. Go to it and it's a very detailed description about carbohydrate restriction and managing your blood glucose and it goes into really into the weeds if you want to reset it. So can I stop you there though? Could you elaborate on that? So you used to say that if you are type one diabetic, you wouldn't. I did because it was very controversial territory. Describe what a diabetic ketoacidosis. Yeah. So if you're type one diabetic you make little or no insulin at all. Right. And, uh, I guess maybe just going back to a normal person, when they fast or they do the kidogenic diet, it increases fat oxidation in the liver and that fat oxidation actually accumulates Acetol Coa Aa and that creates ketones, acetoacetate and Beta hydroxybutyrate, and it curves in the context of insulin suppression. But you're still abnormal insulin, but it's very low, right?

Speaker 3:          02:06:28       Uh, and then when your ketones get elevated, you spill some out in the urine and that's how you eliminate them. Your muscles, your brain burns them. And if they get really high, you have a, an increase in. It's a small increase in insulin release when your ketones get real high and that insulin ramps down fat oxidation in the liver and decreases ketone production. So, and there's other things too, but I don't want to get too much into the weeds, but you're a very, a normal person is finely tuned to create, to maintain physiological ketones within a certain range with nutritional ketosis, with diabetic, a type one diabetes that's completely thrown out the window. So without insulin being there, uh, the absence of insulin essentially creates runaway ketogenesis. And your ketones become very, very high in the context of very high glucose. Exactly. So you have high glucose and high ketones.

Speaker 3:          02:07:19       It creates a metabolic, a disruption. It creates an acidotic state and electrolyte imbalances and coma and death, which is not going to happen in people who are healthy, who are just doing a ketogenic diet. Right? But, but is the type one diabetes, if you, for example, my student, uh, using his own example because I think maybe he was using 20 or 30, I use of insulin a day, right? And then starts carbohydrate restriction and even a modified ketogenic diet and can reduce that insulin requirement to four, five, six. I use a day. So literally knocking it down to 20 percent of what he would have changed in your perception when you did not recommend it a beat. Well, there's a Harvard study that basically looked at a group called type one grit on facebook. There was a group called type one grit and it's got thousands of people who use a low carbohydrate approach, not necessarily a ketogenic diet approach.

Speaker 3:          02:08:18       Some are, uh, but it's very carbohydrate restricted in terms of what a doctor, an endocrinologist would prescribe for a type one diabetic. It would almost make it look like suicide to some people and low carbohydrate dramatically decreases your insulin requirements. And if you look at your continuous blood glucose recordings over the course of a week, those numbers are much, much tighter and that's going to pay huge dividends in the long run when it comes to a longevity and health span. And you know the potential for going blind or decreasing your kidney function, you know, buy these huge post prandial spikes. Essentially. If you're type one day, you're always chasing your glucose with insulin injections, right? Or an insulin pump. If you're carbohydrate restricted, you're basically not it. It's very liberating because you're not. Your dependence on insulin is far, far less, you know, some controversially, some people have gotten completely off of insulin. I would not recommend that, but some people are actually doing that.

Speaker 2:          02:09:18       So the, the, I think, highly not recommended. I hear this from critics, critics of the kidogenic diet, and this is a BS criticism. The again, here's me defending the ketogenic diet is well, you'll, you'll be, you'll become a people who are healthy, you'll have diabetic ketoacidosis. That is not going to happen because by definition, if your ketones are high and your health and you're relatively healthy, not type one diabetic, your blood glucose is low. It's when both are elevated that it's dangerous. Okay, and if you're a type one diabetic, like Andrew who are just using a little bit of insulin to get that baseline, so get your glucose levels down to a baseline level and then you're using a carb restricted diet that creates ketones while your blood glucose. Is that a normal basal level that again, not a Dr Medical Advice, that should not be dangerous

Speaker 3:          02:10:09       right now over the years because he's a power lifter and he's a super big dude. He's like 250 pounds. Like when he goes to the gym, he has learned that he can pulse a little bit of insulin and maybe ramp up is protein or maybe even take it a little bit of carbohydrates, but you know, the next day he's still doing low carb throughout the day. But he's learned to leverage, you know, as a type one diabetic, you, uh, you have that advantage, right? Because you can manipulate for body composition alterations or things like that. So he, uh, he has learned to adjust his protein to maximize his sort of gains and performance in the gym. And uh, but nonetheless he goes from, he went from a strategy, he transitioned to a strategy that would be a, we'd look to be almost suicidal from the perspective of an endocrinologist, doctor managing type one to do that level of carbohydrate restriction would be a.

Speaker 3:          02:11:02       and now we actually have hard science to show that that can not only can be done, that gets that dramatically decreases the variability of your blood glucose fluctuations throughout the day from a weekly perspective and your requirements for insulin. Whenever you could use less insulin to manage your blood glucose, that's a good thing. I would say it's very hard for a doctor to argue against any type. Would I be using less insulin and keeping tighter numbers? There's no way to argue against that. So if you can follow the Diet so that it gets back to adherence again. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:11:35       Right. Again, so it's one of those things, like you said, I'd like to see you try it and do it whatnot. And you know what? I would probably be fine, but I enjoy having a variety of foods and I enjoy having a variety of fuels as well. No, I'm sure you do, but I'd still like to see you try it. Like those two are mutually exclusive. You're right. But I liked having a scientist

Speaker 3:          02:11:58       chapter in his book that's coming out that we worked, you know, tea together and uh, just took some of the concepts that I've don't you find here your preferences change as well, like in terms of your hunger pangs, you're not, you don't crave sugary foods, carbohydrates, but you do. You like them?

Speaker 4:          02:12:13       Yeah. Look at you like I'm getting hungry thinking about it. Oh my God. Give me the sugar. Whereas the pizza, uh, no I don't. When did you have for breakfast this morning? What did I have for breakfast spot? I had a steak and eggs. There you go. And the toast. Toast. Oh, you son of a bitch. Stabbed. Stab him in. The face is wrong with you. Why don't you know, Spike. Big serving of nothing. So lots of energy. Again, it's, it's, it's, it's individual. And I want to point out that if somebody likes a kid and I've had people do ketogenic diet, I've had people you know, get ready for shows and the key to take time that why did you put them on occasion because that's what they liked. They were, they were, they had that preference for that. And it got to a point where for some people their calories get so low if they have slow metabolic rates, that the level of fat restriction it would take them to is probably not great for hormone levels. So I tended to pull a little bit more carb relative to fat and so we didn't start out targeted them as key to Jenny, but by the end they were um, so, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:13:22       so you had to resort to something that actually works. Oh, stop it, stop it. Stop

Speaker 4:          02:13:28       Basal metabolic because metabolic declines. You get to a point that you get to a point, especially to get that lean. I mean I'm somebody who's a, like again, more average muscle mass and pretty fast metabolism. Usually I had to get down to like under 2000 calories a day to get, to get ready for a show. So for me I was, I had my carbohydrates for briefly under 100 grams of carbs per day in that show prep December. But I was sober. I was sticking your fingers and measuring your glucose in the bathroom. I forget where my theory is that when you do that and you carb restrict and you will, you calorie restrict rather and get down, he wants that shit's over. You just want to reward yourself as often as possible. So when someone comes along with something like a key to genic diet and go, no bread, no pop, fuck you, you just, you just don't want to do it.

Speaker 4:          02:14:16       You get, but you get the same. Uh, the adherence and the relapse is the same whether it's key to genic or another diet relapse, like regaining weight, again, like Pasta and bread because there's no, no foods actually create. They've sent, they have great stuff there. Waffles are excellent. They have like a hamburger buns now. Anything I really like, I've made sandwiches with their stuff. Um, what knocks me out more than anything of Ketosis is just too much meat. Yeah. Yeah. Genesis, that's the one that gets me. Again, I, I kind of go back to that. The data is very mixed. Again, if we look at the overall data set, very mixed and all diets have terrible adherence, right? But a lot of that. And that's discipline. Yeah. But we also, now we've got some crazy. I don't want to talk about people aren't disciplined really, really.

Speaker 4:          02:15:17       I really have a giant hard problem, but how does it know so many disciplined people? And I just, I feel their momentum and vibration and I'm like, I just want to concentrate on what they're doing because all these people that can't do it, I feel like that's contagious. You started thinking about people that can adhere to diets and fall off. I get it for you because it's something that you do professionally. But I'm gonna. I'm gonna make it so for you, the ketogenic diet clicks or, or eating more meat clicks that that's something that you really enjoy. You like the state you lost. Dude, I love Pasta. It makes discipline easier because the data doesn't support that. It makes discipline easier in terms of your adherence or in terms of your longterm adherence? Both. Both. So but, but hang on, hang on. For some people, for some people this works better because they feel better. They have better adherence for other people. If you say now you've got some people, if you say, hey, you can have a cookie. It would, it would screw them because they would, they would just go crazy. But for other people, if you allow them more flexibility there, adherence improves. What I'm saying is we need to give people all the options on the table, not demonize any one

Speaker 5:          02:16:30       diet and say, hey, maybe you try to figure out what works for lack of sounding Bro, what works for you and what you can sustain. Go from there, but see this is totally in agreement. I am as well, but you keep saying, Ken sustained. You definitely can sustain more than you do that. The real problem is a giant percentage of the people are weak. Oh, I would agree with that. I guess in the 30, 40 percent people just quit, give up, don't do what they're supposed to do, don't do as many reps as it's supposed to do. Don't work out and take days off just because they're lazy and those are the people that get off the Diet. It's a discipline issue more than anything.

Speaker 3:          02:17:08       The that is really big. So I think various foods that are emerging on the market right now at base systems, Virta health actually has a great app based system that actually coaches you through that and I think that's very helpful. So I think new technologies, foods and we'll make it will increase adherence. Also, when you have a person who knows and understands all the health benefits associated with nutritional ketosis or just a low carb, I think that can be a motivating factor to make them stick to the Diet, but for a guy like you who's rational and discipline, but people their self destructive and weak, they're going to need a burger and fries and need to share their choice. What's the point of the whole conversation than the well, the part of their conversations to avoid those motherfuckers because they're going to drag you down to their mediocre level. I think you need to sympathize with them a little bit because I think the market, and I think this is a fruitful area for entrepreneurs to create technologies and foods that can actually enhance adherence to stop eating strategies. We know about that too, so it's a combination.

Speaker 5:          02:18:14       How much of it is what you're willing to accept from yourself. If you're. If you are willing to accept this seesaw, obesity thing that so many people get on on and off this Yoyo effect. If you're willing to accept that, that's fine, but I just feel like it's a mental state. I really do. I see. Once you achieve a certain amount of success, people start sabotaging themselves. They start, they start dwelling on the fact that they're doing well, but how long can they sustain this? I starts being a big fat mind fuck, and that's when you say like, what's sustainable? What's this data? A lot more than you're willing to do what sustainable is? Stove yell a bit. The person out there that's listening knows, but you know what I mean? It's like there's a thing like we're giving people these fucking escape clauses. We're giving them these, these, these parachutes they can pull. Don't pull the parachute motherfucker. Just have a cheat day. That's fine, but don't get off your diet. Have a cheat meal, you know, fucking giant Sunday. Throw some syrup on that bitch. Get that whip cream going. Do it once, but don't live your life like that. That's nonsense and I think that for. Yeah, I wouldn't disagree with anything you said. People need to hear. Not this like this. Like, well, you

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       can't sustain it. The Quito giant Sam Houston state to state their control. If you do sustainable, if you found for three days, that will give you a lot of confidence that you have control over food fasting for three days. No Diet is sustainable. It's not sustainable over if you look for the general population and you get a bunch of weak bitches and you get them together, how many of them are going to keep it together? How many of them are going to run everyday? How many of you going to work out every day? Very, very, very few. You're dealing with outliers in particular. Just by virtue of what you do, how many people are willing to put the work in to achieve this? That not how many, how many people are gonna achieve this physique? Very, very few. Right? So we're talking about outliers. We're talking about how.

Speaker 2:          02:20:10       That's what I like. I like outliers. I don't like people that are good to hear that that's dangerous, so like that shit is worse than carbs. That's why we talk a lot in the book about behaviors because if you change your behavior, that's what we, I think there's not enough research focused on is let's look at the people who actually achieve weight loss and if you look at people who achieve it and keep it off, they do it through many different methods, whether it's low carb, low fat, whatever it is, but let's look at the behaviors that they make and those behaviors can tell us a lot about people. One thing we know is they practice. They've made themselves very often they so they're accountable. They practice some form of cognitive restraint, whether it's weighing food, recording macros, ketogenic fat restriction, whatever it is, and also they exercise regularly and one, there's physiological benefits to that exercise lowers the body fat set point that your body will defend.

Speaker 2:          02:21:09       So it actually has a physiological benefit, but also just mentally like you said. I mean I never. If you took me back 30 years ago and you told me, hey, les, or when I was 10 years old and you said, hey, when I was bullied and picked on, had no self esteem, you're gonna fucking squat, 668 pounds one day on your back at 201 pounds and set a. it's been broken since then, but a world record, I would have been like, there's no fucking way. There's no way, but when you have disciplined like you said and you that doesn't, just people say you should have more confidence. That's a fucking horseshit advice. Confidence is built through. You set a goal and you achieve. You set a goal and achieve it and you don't start out to say, I'm going to set a world record and that's your first goal.

Speaker 2:          02:21:54       You. I like, what will Smith say? Say you lay a brick as perfectly as you can. Lay it. You do it again and you do it again and you do it again and you talked to anybody who's successful in anything. They didn't start out saying, I'm going to do this earth shattering thing right? They started out and built that confidence over years and years of achieving small goals, which then led them to their big goal. Now we're onto something because I think that the mental state in which you approach anything, a workout routine, a lifestyle, the way you decide to live your life, that is, and here's one of the things that people are cynical about. That's probably one of the best sources of fuel, is inspiration from other motivated people. Go to David Goggins instagram page everyday. Watch that fucking savage. Watch what he does and yeah, he's awesome, but go to people like him.

Speaker 2:          02:22:42       Cameron Hanes, go to go to go to the rock like these fucking people. Just do it. There's no escape. There's no acute sustain that. That's not. I don't want to hear that shit. That's nonsense. Failing is good. It's okay. If you fail, then you're not going to get back on the horse. You're not pushing yourself hard enough. When I say sustainability, I mean if, if it's, if it's because everybody has stuff that they find, again, you find a carb restricted diet to be easier to stick to three feels better for it, better for you, and that's fine, but if, but if somebody is over here and says, you know what, I'm eating a low fat diet. I feel great. My blood markers are good. I have plenty of energy. What's wrong with that? Nothing's wrong with that. There's well Libertarian, oh, unquestionably exists, right? There's A.

Speaker 2:          02:23:29       There's a giant difference between all of this. Some people eat peanuts and they die, right? We all know that. There's just. The body's just very, very different. They're very exactly their caloric requirements, the nutritional requirements, it. That's what's hard about this, right? Is Finding this one thing that is best for you. Yes. And objectively and you know, and being really analyzing your, your actual physical performance, which very, very few people do. They kind of say, well, I feel pretty good, but by what marker, right? Are you, what's your personal best? What are you trying to accomplish? Are you monitoring your heart rate? Are you monitoring your workout? Put like what are you doing to show that this diet is optimal for you? Yeah. Well, and part of that is like a, you know, it's hard to get a lot of money that's going to be spent to get that data for an individual.

Speaker 2:          02:24:16       So part of it is going to have to be what do you feel good on and what do you feel like is again, most sustainable for you because no matter what that people want to diet, what people really want is they want, I don't want to have to track and I don't wanna have to sacrifice anything and I want to get to my goal. Well, tough shit. That's not going to happen. You have to pick what you're going to sacrifice, right? So if you say, I hate tracking calories so I'm just not going to eat carbs because I, I can regulate my body weight that way. Fuck yeah, do that. I had a post on twitter that was one of my most popular twitter posts. I said, you know, health improvements are largely driven by caloric restriction and weight loss, but if, if you like Vegan, if you like Quito Carnivore, if you and I just listed a bunch of different diets and they help you create a restriction and it keeps you at a healthy weight, then fuck yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:25:09       Hell yeah. Like if somebody says, I like eating a Vegan Diet, I'm not interested in losing weight, but Ketogenic, intermittent fasting is very, very easy for me. I loved the food and I feel better and uh, I think all my biomarkers are improving when, when you don't need any other reasoning for why you should do it with him. It works. Now. Can I ask you this? When you say diets aren't sustainable, the data doesn't show that what you're talking about, calorie restricted diets that overall weight loss diets. Are you talking about dietary choices in terms of like key to genic direct question. So it's that if you lose weight, we cannot keep it off. That is, that is the big problem is that most people are able to lose weight and they cannot keep it off because one, the self defense system that we talked about is really weight too quickly.

Speaker 2:          02:25:55       Their body gets into this state where it's always trying to regain that weight back. Part of it, part of it, yeah, like losing it more quickly. There's debate about this, but I would say that it's you have to create a more extreme deficit to do that and so you are activating your body self defense system more intensely. If I had to say it that way, so the rebound is usually bigger as well, so it's. It's trying to find a way of cake. Can we get this weight off and then let's really emphasize to people that the diet after the Diet, nobody talks about this except for us in the book. Nobody talks about this like co writer for the book, Peter Baker and I, we spent were spent chapters talking about when you go and transition into, okay, we've lost the weight we want to lose were healthier.

Speaker 2:          02:26:45       You have to have the same amount of discipline and intensity to then maintain that loss because if you let up, if you let your foot off the gas, now you don't necessarily have to be at the same caloric restriction level, but if you just let yourself go on a vacation, I'm going to eat. I'm gonna, eat what I want, boom, gained 10 pounds and everybody knows people like this, who they go and they do this and you've just, you've literally just undid months of hard work in one week would say if you could maintain that for a set amount of time, say six months. So I think that if someone can maintain that weight loss for six months, that's like sort of like the tipping point where they can go on. Got My wheel house right here, go up. So. So that's a great point. So Leptin as you, I'm sure you've heard of people talking about Leptin, so when you lose fat, Leptin secretion goes down because fat cells secrete it and it's Kinda like your body's thermostat and body fat.

Speaker 2:          02:27:43       Everybody has like a set point their body likes to be. Yet, so if you lose body fat used to create less Leptin, hunger goes up, metabolic rate goes down, Krellan tries to yes and girl is in opposition to Leptin, so you, you. This is your body like a thermostat, so if on a thermostat, if you said it's 75 goes to low, kick the heat on bumper, back up, goes to high, kick the cooling and go back down, left and acts that way with your metabolic rate and your hunger. When you get down to a low body fat, Leptin is low, your body, you have a drive to regain that weight. You're your hungers higher, your boss, your, your metabolic rate is lower. Leptin still stays low even

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       years after a diet and people who have kept the weight off so you would think there'd still be a biological drive to regain the weight. That said, and I'm going to go out on a limb here, so any of my scientists who are listening on this, feel free to call me out on the carpet if you think I'm wrong, but just like obese people, obese people actually have high levels of Leptin. They have high levels of Leptin, but they become leptin resistant up to an insensitive, right. If you stay at a re, there is evidence that if you stay at a reduced body weight for one or two years, that that can become your new set point that your body defense. I think what can happen is even if your Leptin doesn't go out or two years, not six months, yeah, it's a little bit longer, a little bit longer, but it's a good stock aneurysm.

Speaker 4:          02:29:07       What's happening? Well, I think it's probably multifaceted because nothing, your body is so redundant. Usually nothing is ever one thing. Typically your set point, I think one of the things that happens is probably your body becomes more sensitive to the Leptin you have because you're leaner. Now I want to talk about performance because this is a big thing with athletes and particularly in my field with fighters. Many of them were reluctant to try ketogenic diet initially because of the. The first few weeks are pretty rough and it, it really enhanced, inhibits training and you get that Keto flu feeling and I've experienced that too, but overall is the key to genic diet a good strategy for someone that's involved in some sort of a brutal athletic pursuit like football or wrestling. It can be absolutely, and it will be dependent upon being keto adapted over time and actually training in a state of Ketosis.

Speaker 4:          02:30:08       So you forced those adaptations over time. We know that the ketogenic diet is glycogen sparing overtime. Glycolytic pathways will be decreased over time, so that may impair a anaerobic power output initially, but I think that most people, some people, I think a good amount of people could adapt back to, especially if they're taking things like creatine monohydrate and taking various supplements that can kind of fill that gap, uh, to meet the glycolytic anaerobic energy demands. You know, that tighter. Yeah. Yeah. Zack bitter, who holds the American record for the fastest 24 hour run or 24 the fastest 100 mile run. He did it in an 11 hours and 40 minutes. Insane. He ran 100 miles. It's fucking just nonsense. Now she can correspond with him on twitter one time. Not, not by the way. Very, very smart. Jeff Bolek I think, uh, brought him to my attention and actually we're looking at some of the muscle biopsies from various athletes that are doing similar things. Yeah, he is on a ketogenic diet essentially, but when he does these long races, he takes in a considerable amount of glucose. Yup. Yeah. He

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       uses those gels and you know, take hundreds and hundreds, probably relatively sparingly compared to a person that's already like very carb adapted. So. Right. So you just, you just want to, especially a hundred mile race, you titrate in smaller instead of drinking 50 or 100 grams of carbs, 20 grams of carbs every hour or two, maybe more than enough to say if you need to correct us. Well, Zach has a podcast that he also does with Sean Baker and he basically eats mostly meat. I mean, Zach's diet consists of mostly like rib eyes, so he's fully Quito to Andy's using glucose. I think glucose and this may aggravate some of the top. I think glucose is one of the most powerful performance enhancing substances out there really on the record show that, especially in the context of that, where your glycogen levels are being depleted over time. Uh, and even from a training perspective, very small amounts of glucose are anti catabolic, maybe argue anabolic in the context of certain scenarios.

Speaker 3:          02:32:20       So Lloyd May, whether drinks coca cola or small amounts right after he trains. Well, is there any benefit to that? Well, I mean, you're going to get glycogen replenishment. There's research out of a layman's lab years ago that showed that actually sucrose replenishes glycogen, the muscle faster than pure glucose, which is interesting probably because the, the fruit dose gets taken up by the liver. So the glucose you do eat, the liver doesn't steal, steal any of it, and it goes, uh, your glucose go into muscle. But I would say ketones to. So if the science is very new but exogenous ketones, uh, especially in the, in the context of aerobic performance key genics or like a ketone Ester, a key genics products is great. Ketone esters, most of the science behind ketone esters. Uh, but there are, you know, valid applications for the ketone salts that are emerging on the market too, like eugenics.

Speaker 3:          02:33:12       Uh, I think that the science just over the last couple of years has been incredible, um, emerging on that. And I think it's something to watch over time. It's a new fuel source. It's like the fourth macronutrient, right? We have carbs, proteins, fats and alcohol. Yeah. Arguably it can be. So I, I view ketones as they are a calorie containing energy source. So they are a fourth macronutrient. Now, let me ask you this. If you were doing nutritional consultant for say someone who's a UFC champion and they said, you know, I want to get on the optimal diet for performance. You don't think that a ketogenic diet is the optimal diet for performance, is that safe to say? Or you would have to experience for a long period one, it's going to be individual. You certainly wouldn't do it in the midst of a camp, right? If somebody month the, the, the, Oh man, it's such a new season thing to. It's such a nuanced question, but the problem is you don't necessarily get an off season the in the because if they call you with a fight, not look nicely upon if you turn it down. So, um, I think on the research I've

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       seen, I think you're hard pressed to convince me that a ketogenic diet is worse than a non ketogenic diet on endurance. I think that's pretty clear and there may actually be some benefits depending on the individual. Um, as far as repeated sprints or things where you need that anaerobic system, I am not ready to say that acute jake died. It's going to be as good. I think that a non ketogenic diet offers you now this is where ketone supplements may be actually the best thing possible because you could be using glucose so you're getting that fuel source and taking a ketone supplement where you're getting that fuel as well. Not on a ketogenic diet, but taking ketone supplements that will. Again, I don't know. I think honestly I want to see more research so I want to see more reduced fat.

Speaker 3:          02:35:09       It's carbohydrates, maybe amino acids, Korea 10. I mean, you know, just basically trying to leverage all the various substrates that your body can use specially under, if we're talking about anaerobic Ketogenic, something you want to have a suite of different fuel sources, you know, and not rely you like metal bought the term metabolic flexibility, which is kind of used use quite often. Uh, but I think if you train and get your body fat and Keto adapted, that provides benefits for recovery. It provides benefits if you're getting. What are the benefits for recovery, uh, enhanced, uh, you know, lower inflammation, lower chronic inflammation over time, you know, chronic inflammation can contribute to insulin resistance, poor Glycan, a neuro inflammation if you're getting concussions or even subconcussive events over time can actually cause a lot of damage. And I think the mechanism that decreases inflammation with the kidogenic diet as opposed to a non a number of mechanisms, I mean just simply lowering insulin spikes in glucose. But the NLRP three inflammasome, uh, is something that we looked at. There was a study where actually we used the ketone ester and it's published in the journal Nature Medicine showing that, uh, in response to Lps, which is kind of like a, a inflammatory, very powerful inflammatory stimulant that it reduces that and suppresses inflammatory pathways for a particular pathway compared to, uh, compared to, uh, you mean

Speaker 4:          02:36:41       so well with your study, you're always comparing to things. So, so what will you, what was the control group? A,

Speaker 3:          02:36:48       the control group for the inflammation or it was just compared to know, like control thing. So it's just like, did you give us any CBO? Okay. Yeah. Yep. Uh, so in the context of being in a state of Ketosis, it reduces an inflammatory pathway. Think of it as a hub and when that's activated, a, you have a host of inflammatory cytokines that flow throughout your body and your brain and causes persistent low grade a neuro inflammation, inflammation in the body that can impede recovery processes over time. And I think that really contributes to brain health too. So I might be getting a little far ahead of myself because that is its animal work, but it's convincing animal work, looking at a particular pathway that's pretty well defined before you get to this is their one zero variation between a low carb versus ketosis in elevation of ketone levels in your blood.

Speaker 3:          02:37:42       Right. But I mean in terms of a, is there a benefit to the ketogenic to being in a state of Ketosis with this reduction of inflammation versus low carb a? I believe there is just by elevating the metabolite, a Beta hydroxy butyrate, but I do think even low carb has some antiinflammatory effects, but optimal would be ketosis. Uh, I, like I said, I don't think it's going to be optimal for everybody, but I know there's going to be benefits to maintaining low to moderate levels of ketones for neurological health and also for, for recovery and maybe performance lane. You were wincing at the mention of inflammation

Speaker 2:          02:38:26       more so that. So we mentioned recovery from exercise and inflammation and calories

Speaker 3:          02:38:30       deficit is a very powerful anti and anti inflammatory. So I mean Lane Lane address.

Speaker 2:          02:38:36       Thank you for the context. My fellow scientists known Zilla appreciate that. So one thing I want to, because because people get, it's easy to get into black and white thinking. We hear inflammation and we think, oh, that, that's bad, that's bad. So there's some studies that tell us quite a bit about inflammation. Your body actually has an optimal level of inflammation, too. Little inflammation is actually bad as well. So if you first chronic. I was talking about chronic. Yes. This is a lot of thing. A lot of scientists, ms dot two is an acute. We can tell about tor and cancer and people, acute versus chronic and how scientists even messed this stuff up, but you. So if you, if you look at studies of recovery from exercise and muscle growth, I'm focusing on this, but I'll, I'll bring it back around. If you give Ibuprofen to healthy people who have normal levels of inflammation, uh, Ibuprofen inhibits muscle growth.

Speaker 2:          02:39:28       If you give it to elderly people with high levels of inflammation, they grow more muscle. So this means that the body for recovery has an optimal level of inflammation at likes to be in. There is a a, a kind of a curve here. It's a cox two inhibitor and Beta hydroxybutyrate is also a costume, right, and so the part of growing muscle and recovery is actually inflammation. Macrophages and all these sorts of things are involved in that process. Now if it gets run away, if it's too much, it's not a good thing, but if it's too little, it's also not a good thing. Andy Galpin did a great job on your show of talking about a recovery versus adaptation, right? Yeah. So one of the things he said, if you do ice baths, you, these sorts of things, your in the short term, allowing yourself to recover faster, but you're also limiting how much adaptation you're going to incur.

Speaker 2:          02:40:21       And I loved that because it was people miss this. They say, you know, if you're, if you're somebody in the off season, if you're trying to grow, get more lean body mass or trying to get better at something, it's probably good to let your body like for lack of better term, have some inflammation and not in the longterm but in response to that training session. But then if you're in a camp, again, this is where it's context dependent or like I'm a power lifter getting ready for a meet and I'm supposed to be squatting four times a week. I've done that before and I'm so sore that I can't squat my fourth session than an ice bath or something. I'm not worried about growing muscle in that time. I'm worried about getting recovered enough that I can go do my next training session because that is a lot more important for my competition coming up.

Speaker 2:          02:41:05       Then having that little bit of extra muscle. So in camp, probably a good idea. Postseason not a good idea. Yeah, I mean unless again, it's all contextual dependent, right? Like if you start getting so sore that you can only train like twice a week, then maybe a certain level, but that points back to that there's an optimal range of inflammation that your body probably should be in that's optimal for health as well. Now I don't think like doing a ketogenic diet for somebody, it's going to take them out of that necessarily, but I always want to give context because people hear these things and they always think it's a positive. Like in terms of recovery,

Speaker 3:          02:41:40       I believe that it can enhance the adaptive process associated with recovery. And I also believe that being in a ketogenic state will enhance your readiness, your resilience and your recovery. So from a military perspective too, I believe that, uh, and, and that needs to be validated and study, but it's something that, that we study. When you, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but when you advise us to the military, do they, do you put them on a specific meal plan to, or do they have, it's more like, you know, how to do that grants whereas is being studied at a very fundamental, very controlled level from cells to animal models to human clinical trials going on and where the data is being collected now and some of it is taken empirically and anecdotally from the field or just from various, uh, exclusive channels. I guess I would say, uh, so that I am coming at it as a biased and I'm, I'm kind of speaking ahead of the science, but I do think that science already exist showing that you have a greater adaptive effect just by virtue of lowering inflammation over time in athletes especially.

Speaker 3:          02:42:48       This probably pertains more to endurance athletes, so it really needs to be studied in resistance trend, mma fighters and things like that.

Speaker 2:          02:42:55       So there was a recent study that I can't remember the researchers, Dave, I'll send it to you. I had a lot of criticisms of it, but they did show that ketogenic versus non ketogenic diet and people who were lifting weights trying to get bigger, that there was actually slightly less mass using the ketogenic diet where you think that would be because of the less protein? No, they equated protein. I'm pretty sure I want to say they equate it. Protein now. I don't know for sure. So I don't want to say authoritative today, but I believe to stay in Ketosis, you're going to. How did they adjust for calories? I believe they did. So again, I could be wrong and so I'll go back and look and I'll, I'll send it to you if you want it. Um, but it is possible like again, for every given me there's a Gotcha in certain things.

Speaker 2:          02:43:40       Right? So like these things that activate different pathways. Well, part of what ketones may signal as a deficit because usually you don't have them in a surplus, right? So, you know, we don't know if you can like for example, like a tough dog, right? Like if we're talking about performance and muscle, everybody here is a tough gig and that's a very, by the way, that's such a weird way to pronounce that because it's auto and phagocytosis so it shouldn't be out of age. But anyway, it's a very rapidly emerging science. And Naomi Whittell wrote a book about this and it just, it's like a New York Times bestseller and that really covers a science. So licensed since two or three years. Yeah. License almost remodeling and degradation of proteins, but very high. What, what gets me is like people who are big on intermittent fasting, they'll say, oh, increases a tough Gig, but you also, they're also saying you can grow all this muscle and it's going to be best for building muscle, but that's not true because autophagy autophagy is part of protein degradation.

Speaker 2:          02:44:38       So if you're increasing that system, by definition that's less muscle. So you're, there's always a give me an a Gotcha. For one benefit, there might be a drawback. Now, depending on your individual situation, maybe it makes more sense. Right? Like having the most muscle mass possible may not be the best thing for health. Now we know that having, having more muscle mass than normal is good for health, but maybe having like absolute peak muscle mass may not be the best thing for help, you know. So it's like, that's why I was trying to say earlier there's never going to be one diet that just fixes all of our problems. It depends on the individual and what they're trying to get out of it. Just like, um, if I went to a, and again I'm not a have much. I watched MMA for years. Loved your commentary.

Speaker 2:          02:45:23       That's where I learned a lot of stuff about eminent mma, but if I went to a Brazilian Jujitsu instructor and I said, what's the best technique? He's got to look at me like I'm an idiot, right? Because he's not going to say, yeah, a arm bar every time. That's the best technique for Jujitsu and that's when people say what's the best diet? It's the same thing, right? It's completely contextual. Dependent, right? Depends on you and in the case of inmate, depends on your opponent as well. What your goals are, your strategies and your tactics. I think what we were trying to really emphasize is that individuality dependent, but also I really want to emphasize that this show was calories matter. You know, calories matter, even in even if you're eating low carb, you can't just eat as much as you want and Herbie is a very viable option

Speaker 4:          02:46:10       to induce and sustain a calorie deficit that can contribute to body composition. But even like you brought up a floyd mayweather, whether earlier, which I thought was great because you said he drinks a coke after trading. Well, it's hard to argue with his results. But then again, sometimes elite athletes can get away with a lot of really dumb shit because they're so genetically superior that they were going to do well no matter what. Did Michael Jordan eat a big Mac before every game? No, not true steak and baked potato, steak and baked potato. Whereas the big MACs Myth, myth come from fucking by Mcdonald's model steak and baked potatoes. Sounds like my wife can eat two or three big MACs and a sitting and wash it down with a full sugar coke and still gain nothing. I cringe, but she. Some people can do that. Some people can do this, sure.

Speaker 4:          02:47:00       But this. So it's. It's. Did he become this great because he ate this way or can he eat this way because he's this great athlete. I probably the latter, right? So we wouldn't recommend like somebody like if somebody is sitting at home and they want to become the greatest boxer ever, don't go pro ball. Public drinking coke isn't the first step. Right? But this is what we do with nutrition because we pick out people that we follow and we go, Oh I, I'm just gonna do that. And it's so individualized. The sidelines and marathons, like they'll hand off coax to people. I've seen it because people just want it for fuel and people just wanting it for fuel tasted it is not a bad idea when you're doing something that's as grueling as American. I don't want to say it's a bad idea. I don't.

Speaker 4:          02:47:43       Yeah. I'm not against it either. If you're a carpenter now it makes sense. Dense, right? Yeah. But you want calorie dense stuff when you're absolutely a bad thing. Again, context is so important because we don't ever drink a coke. Well, if you were starving to death, I promise you you drink a coke, you know, so it's, it's. And if you need quick energy, it's probably not the worst thing that floyd mayweather could possibly do. Posts but not optimal. Yeah. A lot of people eat those honey waffles, you know, like when they're doing hikes and stuff. But again, at the end of the day, if, if he, if his car was hydrated and take it, I don't know what it is, but if he's eating five, 600 grams of carbohydrate a day isn't really hurting him to have 40 grams of sugar from a coke if he's like maintaining his bodyweight, performing optimally.

Speaker 4:          02:48:28       When you think about the kind of grueling workouts that guy puts his, maybe that's the only way he can maybe. I don't know. Again, I'm, I am theorizing. Maybe that's the only way he can get enough food in is to eat really energy dense sources of food to maintain his bodyweight. And if you started saying, well we need you to eat chicken breast and Broccoli and you know, this organic rice and all this kind of. He, he might start dropping weight like a stone and his performance go in the tank. So this is why context is so important. And again, like when we talk about people think, how many times have you seen two guys in the octagon and just looked at their bodies and gun, this one going to smash this other guy like just in the primal part of your brain because he was built like a tank and then the other guy who looks like nothing just goes out and completely obliterate.

Speaker 4:          02:49:15       It, happens all the time, all the time, all the time. Right? So it's completely context dependent. The biggest thing is to make sure that you don't run out of fuel during these things, right? Or whatever. And whatever your sport is. I mean, again, I'm known as a carb guy and I had this powerlifter one time telling me, he's like, don't you think you should carb load the night before? And I was like, dude, you're doing nine reps like you're doing. So you get three attempts on each lift, squat, bench press and deadlift. You're not depleting glycogen Harb Limited. He's like, what? Really amazed me. Even like you can fast for a week, which I did, and deadly. And it's not a significant a inhibitor of your. Of your performance running would be hills or something like that or doing rowing prolonged, you know, resistance training, two or three, three hours, then it's probably not optimal to go and fasted to a strength, an athletic event, but you know, it's, it's, you have to pick the context, the individual and honestly people probably aren't gonna want to hear this from a scientist, but we don't know enough about this stuff yet to really say for each individual person what's best for them.

Speaker 4:          02:50:26       And that's why we kinda got to go by feel. We know you don't have to go drinking gatorade throughout your one hour workout in the gym. Typically, you know, I'm, I'm drinking ketones, but it's, you don't, it's not going to offer you any advantage. It's not. And I did that for many years actually, and I think guys still do it now. Of course when we see it all the time, I got to make your shake in the gym and drink a interim work. One thing that, one of the things that drove me nuts was I kinda gotten a little back and forth with Tim noakes on twitter and he kind of made it out to seem that, you know, people were just missing some of his research because people in academia or that peer review is broken. Who's a tim noakes. Oh, sorry. He's a big proponent.

Speaker 4:          02:51:08       He's a professor in South Africa, I want to say, and very knowledgeable and opinionated, but very knowledgeable. He said to me, he's like, well, that's because you've never challenged convention because I was, I was and and dog knows. I have challenged every convention in the fitness industry that there ever was, but it's just, you know, when, when people asked me, he's vocal about it. Yeah. Assertive, but also open minded. Yeah. I'm very open minded. I just don't like if you can't show me a hard evidence, you know, like there was a great quote from Thomas Soul that I saw the other day. It said you could ask these in science and go a long way in terms of sorting out bullshit compared to what, uh, where's your heart evidence, you know, and what is the cost, right? So it's, well, low carb is better compared to what and what's the cost on performance or any of these other things. And then where's

Speaker 2:          02:52:06       your heart evidence? Right? So this is why, like I said, science over time, yes, you can have industry influences. You can have muddled data and some scientists fake data. We've, we've both come across this scientist who have fake data are frustrating. Is that, oh, it makes me so incensed. In fact, I, I won't say anybody by name, but I used to be in business with somebody who I found out that I had no hard evidence, but I had a lot of circumstantial evidence that they were faking data and it's even happens in cancer research. It's a huge role even in cancer. And I took this person out to dinner and I told them was, I was like, we're done. Like this thing we're doing is done. And, and thank goodness I did because it came out later, people started replicating trying to replicate this data and nobody can replicate this data and and they still had a pretty big following even now, but you know, it's, it's one of those things, it makes me so mad because then people would get so frustrated because they feel like if they feel like scientists or just an industry's pocket, why are they going to believe anything?

Speaker 2:          02:53:10       Any of us say, you know, it's so frustrating and that's why motivation, money, power, ego. If a labs, it's a company's funding you for a particular supplement and you come out with consistently with negative data, what's the incentive for them to keep funding you? But if you, if you're always showing positive results on supplement studies, settlements will. Companies will want to fund you. Of course. Now of course, but you know, it's so seamlessly, so danger. But I also want people to keep in mind that it's gotta be done in a very controlled, blinded fashion. That's the only way around it. I keep reminding people like people who say things like, we found the cure for cancer and the government is suppressing it, and, and uh, all the scientists are just in the pie. You what you're saying is you're saying that every scientist on the planet who does cancer research is an immoral, unethical piece of shit.

Speaker 2:          02:54:01       That's what you're saying because you're just telling me they don't have friends and family who are dealing with cancer and they're suppressing this research. Come on now. You know, and that's, that's the other big. I'm a, I'm a small government guy and I'm like I said Libertarian, but one of the things that makes me cringe about libertarian sometimes as these big elaborate conspiracy theories that come up around science and whatnot, like you realize like a senator can't even a text, a dick pic to is his side chick without like, it winded up all over twitter. You think they constructed these big elaborate theories. They can't even tie their shoes in the morning without spending $10,000. You know? So the idea that like all this research is being suppressed by the government. I'm not saying it's never happened, but I think it's pretty darn rare. Well Gentlemen, we just did three plus hours. Thank you. Felt like six. I'll just appreciate you giving us. Thanks for illuminating this stuff, which is still. It's so complex. That's part of the problem and I think we give you 100 of these shows and we'd never cover all the topics are all the issues are all the details and I think it's so incredibly difficult for people to find the right diet and program that works for them.

Speaker 3:          02:55:13       I'd like to add one thing that the science is rapidly emerging and the metabolic health summit, which is happening in a the end of January, beginning of February next year 2019, we'll be bringing in the leading scientists that are talking about all the different topics right now including your weight loss and that's going to be in la. It's actually there's a flyer in your book there. If you look inside there giving you a flyer.

Speaker 2:          02:55:39       All right, La, a January 31st to February third in Long Beach Metabolic

Speaker 3:          02:55:45       health summit.com. It's going to be very comprehensive group of, of basic scientists, clinical scientists, entrepreneurs and people everyday people that are just interested in this space. You going and I will be added. I'm helping to sort of organize and promote it, uh, but also moderating some of the things we're going to hit on. Basically every topic that was discussed in my last podcast in this podcast, the leading scientists I'm going to show up and heckle. Yeah. So we, we definitely went lay in there too and I think it would be great to have a panel discussion that addresses this with a couple more experts and personalities and in that

Speaker 2:          02:56:23       it's amazing how much information you have to absorb. It's really, I've done so many diet podcasts and am still a moron. That's why you'll, I always tell people, you know, it's hard because if you're not going to do a degree yourself or do research yourself, it's so hard to know who, like you kind of have to pick people that you trust. Right? And it's so hard to know who to trust because there was something that, uh, Greg knuckles really smart guy said that I think kind of ties things together nicely. He said, people are really good at knowing when somebody has more knowledge than them about a subject. Like you talked to somebody for a little bit and you, you really can get an impression pretty quickly if they know more or less than you are about the same. What they're really bad at doing is figuring out amongst two people who know more than them, who is the more knowledgeable of the two.

Speaker 2:          02:57:09       They are very bad at picking that out. So you kinda got to pick people who you trust. Now, if you're looking for people to trust, notice the three magic words that me and him both sit on here today. At one point, I don't know it well. Usually experts, they don't make broad claims. They don't use superlatives. They don't say things like best, worst, never always. They're usually putting context to everything and they're providing you with information that helps illuminate you. That everything is nuanced. And that's why like, I'm sure, again, I'll relate it to mma. If you talk to anybody who's an expert in any different discipline and you asked them abroad question, you're going to get a really broad answer and if you ask them a specific question, give him a lot of contexts, then they'll give you a specific answer. But I would you agree with that? Yes, definitely. So I think someone's strong on one

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       side, dig kind of deep and look for conflicts of interest to and kind of. So I think that's kind of an important thing. I try to be transparent as much as possible on, on sort of things we're involved in. So I think that super important without bias too. I mean I sell stuff, I've got a book out, I've got another book coming out of a website, you know, so it's. Yeah, but you're not actually. Well not advocating any particular approach, you're kind of approaching it from what I'm selling isn't really sexy. They're complete contest prep guide and this is available on all those places. [inaudible] dot com, [inaudible] dot com. And your twitter, bio lane, instagram, bio lane. And Dom yet a kito nutrition.org and a ketone technologies as our company. Uh, it's an information website. I don't have any products per se, at least not yet, but I put products on there that I personally use and kind of vetted out that I think could be helpful. And just a lot of information like your, your prior podcast with me is on their costs in a and Tim Ferriss and Rhonda Patrick to have right on the front page. Your twitter and instagram. Yeah. Uh, dominic d'agostino dot Katie. I think his instagram, not a huge instagram back, but a Degas Dino, d a g O, s t I two a is my twitter handle. Uh, and Dominic D'agostino for facebook too. So there were three gentlemen, I think we got a lot accomplished today. Thank you so much. Really appreciate, appreciate, appreciate it. Thanks Joe.
