Speaker 1:          00:00:00       By herself in a house. Like she should series. The thing about buying a house, Jamie and me, you yes. Are you should fear in the fucking house. So we feel like we're doing something. There we go. These headphones make a difference. It's so much easier without glasses. They used to pinch me. Oh, that's right. Crush my ears just went and got your eyes cut on. They put a fucking laser right to your eyeball and they go, don't look at it. I'm like, it's IRA. I Blah. Oh Wow. Because you're looking at him like, I know I'm looking at it, it's right in my eyeball. So what do you have to do? What? Which one are you ready to head? And so they come in like this looks, but then it's like right as it gets right into your eyes, slightly to the left. Like it goes to like the outside of the, the black part, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       How do they keep your eyeballs opened from blinking? Uh, um, what's it called? Style. Like a speculum. Yeah, but what's that movie? Clockwork. Yeah. They do that to, you know, really hitting you with drops to like wet it. Oh my God. That they peel back the layer like a grape, you know, like the show up rate. How does that feel? Nothing. It doesn't feel like anything. You can't really feel it whoa. Later. It feels like, cause it's like a slight scar that has to heal. But you're not used to having a scar between your eyelid in your eyeball. So it feels like a piece of sand is in there and they're like, do not rub it. There's no sand in there. Just don't rub it. I balls or some fucking serious shit. It's one of the most disturbing things to me about mma is I pokes when guys get, I poked almost I'd to, I'd rather see a guy get hit real hard.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       They didn't get I poked. That was the worst thing of on a game of thrones. Oh God, dude crushed him with two I boiler alert, whatever spoiler stuff that's five years old. It's not that I knew show was like three or four years old dude who got smushed. It was bad ass ass. I wanted to win so bad. He had so much going for him so much. He was going to get revenge. Finally he had flare, he had technique. He was a bisexual. Yeah, but they all were back then. Man. People just fucked everybody back. Then there's like, there's so much of a different world. If we think about like what the Romans did and what all these different cultures did, they were like fucking each other. Fucking young boys like young boys. It was normal for guys to fuck young boy. Like what the hell? Better World. Right?

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       It's fucking strange when you go back and you listen to like, it was plato, right? Plato was one of the big ones. The big boy fuckers wasn't he fucker. I think polito was a soldier. He uh, he was uh, like a, a warrior, like accomplished warrior then philosopher. Yeah. If I'm remembering this story correctly, which we're pretty fucking high, right? Which is probably wrong high right now and it's awakened big day. Has this pet or have you heard that term? What does that, when I googled him and boys, that's what comes up. So what does a better us? It means someone who likes to fuck young boys.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       It's bizarre that that was like really commonplace amongst very respected intellectuals at one point in human history played or didn't lose his fucking subway campaign. You could go on big philosophers in history. Yeah, you don't take it away. If they're dead and it's a long time ago, we set, well, I mean we should, right? Because he had a lot to contribute. We should, we should accept aberrant behavior, but we should also maybe look at it as a sign of, there's some, there's massive advancement and understanding about human beings, about the consequences of sexual abuse, like all those things, like I don't think they really had enough time to live to figure things out enough. Everyone's was dead at 30 right. There's going to fuck them up as adults. I'm like, wait, what did you, how fucking stupid this country is, right. How ridiculous we are if we look at each other as a collective.

Speaker 1:          00:04:06       When you find out things that people get upset with something or tweeted today about this, was it chase, whatever, whatever bank it was, they wouldn't allow a guys checked. They canceled his check because he wrote dash on it, which is his fucking dogs name Dash and they thought dash was too close to an Islamic word, which is like a d a. E. S. A. Where did he write it on it? He wrote it on a check like two. It's fucking dog. Where's this money going? Note to south dog might like maybe just dog got out of the memo. Pus some, some part of it like pull it up Jamie. Cause I thought it was in his lap mcmahon. That was the reason they can't you send something to a guy named I met exactly. What if the guy's name is Muhammad or we fucked. Now how does Mohammad Ali get his checks out of the homiletic bank?

Speaker 1:          00:04:54       Freezes online payment over Doug's terrorist sounding name. Po. Can you scroll it so we could see what the words are because it's hurting my brain. I have a picture of her. You guys trying to find the picture and here's the young guy he's got, he's got to think he's got, um, that makes them get more sympathy for sure. The scroll up went noose. What was his disease? Jamie? I want to see, yeah, multiple sclerosis. He was transferring money from his chase account. Whose dog? Walker. So he put the nine year old pitbulls moniker dash in the memo line because this is to pay for his fucking dog Walker. Yeah. And it's too much like d a. E. S. H the Arabic term for self described Islamic state. That's their word for isis. Yes. I guess. But it's not the same word. You fucks. That's like you, you can't write nagger explain what someone's that nags.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       You can't write that. Oh, is it because I mean donating money to isis and he's like, uh, hold on. Yes, exactly. They thought for some reason that that was a red flag or you're not allowed to give money to isis. I don't think you're allowed to look at it. Says it says it flagged a payment, which place to note on Francis Account asking him to explain what dash explaining yourself son, God dammit soldiers died. But it's the, it's not the same word, like think of how many words day die. I mean does it w w w w what are we going to da e s h is not the same as d a s. H, right? Is that what it is? D. A. E. S. H. Yeah. It's just not the same word. Like we have combinations of words that are vastly different. So this is one extra letter. Yes, it is a word and it means to go fast.

Speaker 1:          00:06:36       It everybody knows it. It's so stupid. I mean, you think there's so many different combinations that you can say our close flagged reviewed and eventually released out an hour. What about that other, the same thing? Is it the same word? Should we flag it? Is it the same? What do you mean? Did you mean out or hour? I wrote out, I wrote out you fuck. Well, yes, but we would like to know if you met our, well, I woulda wrote our, oh, go out. You fucks. Okay. That's cleared up, but I don't think you have to call us fucks by you. Why are you contacting me? This is not what you're supposed to do. We supposed to do is pay my goddamn dog walker so I don't look like a dickhead. So she's got a pair of fucking rent and you ruined everything. Sorry, I understand you're upset, but if you're just calm down, we're trying to stop terrorism. It's fucking the Rothschild's or some shit. Chem trails sort of. If you could watch a longer scenes and nine 11 all together with the fucking moon landing and area 51 bullshit. I want my fucking money.

Speaker 1:          00:07:41       She's a great dog. Ever lose it on a customer service person. I'm like, that is fucking go nuts. I'm not like that. I try. I try to be, I hate those jobs. I wouldn't want that job. They don't want that job. I tried to be, I know it's not never their fault. I try to be as nice as possible. Some people are just so, it's not even their fault. Something people that you talk to like customer service people are so like if, if it's for something Shitty, like something that happens all the time, like they're dealing with so many people that are complaining all the time. Oh right. Yeah. I remember when apples, uh, Robert, the iphone, oh yeah. End Up, you know, 18th he only had it drops, calls were dropped left and right because everyone had gone on there and I was like, what's up?

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       He goes, I was like, Hey, you must deal with a lot of calls about drop calls. Like it's a lot. It's a lot of angry people. I remember I had a guy talked me through some issue on my phone once I had to call a dude. I don't remember what the exact issue was, but like all my contacts went away. I was like, what is going on here? And he had to talk me through it and figure out how to get it back to the way it used to be an update things. So it was, it was a nightmare. But I remember the guy while I was like, dude, okay, how much does this job suck? Like go, I'm not completely retarded and you're trying to help me through this. And I've built computers. I, I've taken a

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       motherboard, I put it in, I put the seat, I put the heat sink in, and I've done all that added video cards. I know a little bit about computers, just, I mean, I'm not like a computer wizard, but long, average retard. Right? And I was barely figuring it out. I was like, okay, I gotta go back. I got to delete. What do I do? I start fresh. Okay. I go to my backup. I have a backup. I was at with the key law. Well, where did they go? Where's all my contacts go? Why did they get chewed up like this? I don't know anybody's, fuck, I don't know your number. You're the same number forever. I don't know what the fuck it is. I just look at my phone, I find your number and I call you. And um, but I remember talking to the guy going like, what is this like, man?

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       He's like, dude, I can't even describe it. He's like, people call up you like if you ever even see if you have a phone or a video or are you just crazy? They say, he says to them, he wants to say to them like, do you know how to be like, okay, did you turn it on but the phone's black. I saw somebody in the airport doing that but on a call like I don't understand. How do you get the thing to send and I want to be like, Hey lady, that send button at the bottom is what you're looking for. Sometimes it talks to me. That's that Siri, ma'am, why does Siri, what is theory? Is it important what they're saying? Did you say, Hey Siri, what the fuck are you? I don't know what I said. Phone is talking to me is a bigger issue when you say, Hey Siri, Hey Siri.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       I like me saying this right now. Over and over again. People right now, all across the world are yelling at me. He'd get mad, they get mad cause it start. Your phone starts talking to you like it happened to me when I was in my car listening to a podcast of us talk to you about, Hey Siri, my phone went off because the podcast said, Hey Siri. So my phone started asking me what can I do for you? I was like, oh my God, this is ridiculous. And sometimes it starts transcribing things sometimes. Like, Hey, Siri will activate and then it'll transcribe a whole list of shit that you're saying. Wow. Yeah. I'm like, what do you do? That's not my question. Like, Hey, Siri thinks you have like a four paragraph long question for it. So you're just like, oh hey Siri, look up hardcore black and white

Speaker 3:          00:11:16       pornography. I'm a different person at work. I don't even care about those things. Work at work. I wear a suit and I have very special behavior. I'm a different person here. I am. I different.

Speaker 2:          00:11:39       I used to, I used to wear my yarmulke up, my law firm. I worked at it as a, it's like a 1718 year olds and um, and then I would take it out. What would I do? Owe a lot of guys, law lawyers were coming in to take the Yamaka office and as I got

Speaker 1:          00:11:53       in, because I wanted to blend in, but I would keep mine on whatever, but the next year I lost my religion and then I didn't want to explain to everybody that I did wasn't religious anymore. So I would come in, put my Yamaka on and then as soon as I left I would just take it off again. Ooh, that's a good mood. Yeah. For a whole summer. That's a better move than explaining it. Yeah. Planning. It is a lot of work. That's how much I had to every person. It's the same explanation, but if you worked in a small office with people that you really liked, it wouldn't be that big. It was four or five people. Who are one sec guys. Uh, sorry. I realized I was all bullshit. Hey he fella. Where's your special hat? We had a lady follow us up once on the elevator telling you and this other guy were like, what? Flora? And she goes up, do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior?

Speaker 1:          00:12:42       I don't know what floor. That's, Huh. I was like, shoot, didn't even, wasn't even going there. She followed us. We were going for lunch. She came back and followed up at the elevator. Just don't do that. What's worse? Dem vegans like for proselytizing? Who's the co who hits you the hardest? At the heart of it, they see Jesus freaks. Just want to help your soul. Right. Good call. What does what of vegans want? They want the animals. Yeah. And now not at the heart of it. They both want to feel better than you. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Michael Shermer calls it virtue signaling. You met Michael Shermer. Yeah. He's, he's the best. Yeah. He was on a couple of weeks ago. Great Guy. Real Nice Guy. Like very fun to talk to a wise man. Yeah. Because it virtue signaling. It's a great way of describing me. You're signaling to everyone that you have virtue by your action.

Speaker 1:          00:13:38       Peacocking your virtue, you know, and uh, it, it annoys the fuck out of people. Yeah. It's gross. It's gross. Like from, from all sorts of different standpoints. Not just about your diet, but about a lot of different things. New Aa people are like that. Yeah. New Aa. People who love Yoga people could be like that. I've been guilty. Really guilty or that I'm annoying. I just feel so clear now. I, yeah, I'm annoying with that. Oh, I used to give me a gluten free gluten free work for a little while. Here's what the gluten free taught taught me. Um, I don't really have a tolerance problem to gluten, but gluten is essentially sugar. When you, when you're getting gluten, you're getting getting it from bread and gluten is like a protein. Wheat bread is fucking sugar. Yeah. Sugar. I go without, um, without sugar on Wednesdays. And then, uh, Mike vacuum was like pizza, but that just turns to sugar in your body.

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       But shut up scientist. I'm not talking about that. I cut all that stuff out too. And sugar. Yeah. Wow. No Pizza. Nope. No, I don't need it anymore. He didn't eat that bread last night. Talking to all those door guys. Devour the leftovers. It's pounds of meat. Yeah. There's this place called doctor uglies, Tyler, Texas barbecue. And it's out in Van Nuys, California and is my all time favorite barbecue spot in California for sure. One. And what's one of the best in the country? It's amazing cause those ribs look like fucking flintstones. Yup. There were massive, super legit too. Like the paneling on the wall is like shitty fake wood. It's been the same way since 1974 it's just, it's just classic. It is a classic restaurant. It is Americana and they give you an insane portion of me. So much meat. I can't believe I the way that that, okay, that was a, that's a try.

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       Those, what does it shows three different things. That was triple Combo. Triple Combo. You had beef ribs, so you had spare ribs and yet Greski obviously brisket, you can't go to a barbecue. What's it like having the brisket? If you've got a combo, it's hard and brisk and figure out what else do you want. Yeah, that was 23 bucks. It's nice, but it wasn't even that much. It's insane amount of food because that's easily enough food for three people, like we pigged out and eat it all. But three reasonable people that place for me. And plus they give you sides. What are we doing? A commercial for? Animals die for that. She didn't even tell everybody about it. I don't want anybody to know. Why do one do well? What are the best barbecues you've ever, there's a bunch of good spots in Texas. There's a bunch of good spots outside of Austin Franklin.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       Uh, I've been the one outside of us, but Franklin in Austin, Franklin Barbecue is supposed to be insane. Yeah. And the cool thing is, so the lines are coming down the street. The first time I went, it was raining. I got lucky. I waited for an hour and a half. Uh, totally worth it. Why? Because it was raining because it was right there. And they, uh, they said everybody come on and off the street, get under the cover, we'll go. They're all cool people. But industry has risen up around that line. Like that is task rabbit people. They'll wait in line for you for 20 bucks, but now they're onto them. So like, you can only order for up to like four people a fucking chair. Salesmen's they have rental chairs up in line. Just waiting there like, hey, well I can make money. Does it find a chair for you and the line moves?

Speaker 1:          00:16:48       No, I think you got to come up, pick it up and I know you should get up and they should move his boy. You like you're royalty. Yeah, I would love that. That'd be right. They come out and sell beer, so I know how weird. It's so weird, but it's so fucking good that brisket melts in your mouth. Like it's, it's just like, it's like cotton candy. This is another place in Austin that Aubrey swears by two, I don't remember. Yeah, he lives in Austin. Yeah. There's another place that he says is just as good, but it's not a scene. Santa suit. Well, something that got popular got on TV, right? It got an Anthony Bourdain show. Well, he would trade with the other guy who used to be the best guy in Austin. This got trained with him, got his own smoker. It was just in a back parking lot.

Speaker 1:          00:17:25       That's what they do. They go pack parking lot. So the first time I went, I just, I looked for one, I was like, ah, molars, Mueller, Mueller's barbecue. And I went in there at like 1230, no lines. Like, oh, it was cool. Great. I was like, Hey, can I get some? Uh, and they're like, what are you sold out of me in a long time ago? Signed, you've got to get here early. They sell at a meet at certain times. At some point the line for Franklin to go, no more Turkey, just so you guys know. And then 10 minutes later, no more prestigious. And I'm like, AH, Fuck Jews. They only have meat enough for that day. So by two, they're closed. Their dealers, their dealers, their dealers and getting you out it creating a surplus. They got a line of people. Yeah. It's, it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:18:04       It's, it's a cool, but then they do like, oh, we got to where they had it. So they had that smoker in the back parking lot somewhere and then they had to find a buyer place. They literally have an over abundance of buyers. They have too much. Yeah. Like they, they keep their business exactly as big as it is, but they haven't, they haven't expanded. Wow. That's so rare. Perfect. Yeah. Yeah. It's so rare though, right? It's, it's glorious. It's very rare. It's very, just say something like, Oh, I'm just going to keep running this business where I can keep my eye on everything. We can do it the right way. They give you brisket in line, like a Katz's Deli. Oh really? You know with the Pastrami, they'll like taste this, you know? They walked by with some, just as you get to the front, they just cut you off some test, which are about to order.

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       Oh, that's good. Yeah. They did that to us in this place that we went to. Me And ben and Aubrey went to this place. It's about 40 minutes outside of Austin. I forget the name of it. Yeah. I went there. Yes. You've been to. That's what there with Metzger and a few of the people I met Scott in the last brisket and we all had a fucking suck up on some goddamn Turkey to hot legs, peasant immigrants. He didn't split the brisket with him. No, he did not. Wow. That's not a kind person. He's selfish. That's dark and he's taking his time. There's three of you and you guys like seven of us. Okay. Fuck them. Yeah. Yeah. How many people? You guys can all have a lick of one bite. The problem is you roll too deep. Yeah, because that's just too much brisket to hang around.

Speaker 1:          00:19:26       All those different folks. It's like, sorry, we should've gotten there earlier. What I was getting to earlier was that, think about that. Who Guy, that dash thing about how stupid that is that this is in 2016 with the world that we live in today, these kind of morons are still making decisions. Some six year old girl got arrested for stealing candy to put her in handcuffs. See that six years old heard her handcuffs, scared straight stuff. Had to be that no cop is going to look it up. A girl. I go like, we really got to take her in. I don't know, but it wasn't a white girl for sure. It wasn't, obviously it wasn't a white car. Isn't that, I mean you, could you even imagine that taking college or not? When a went to a white girl? No, that's crazy. Young Lady Racist. Oh yeah, that's crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:20:14       Off the top racist. Oh, she's so cute. Over the top races. Chicago mom, outrage after daughter's six placed in handcuffs for taking candy, taking any of the teachers that I thought maybe there was some Persian guy who was like, no, she stares. You'll go that law. And then I had to be like a restaurant on arrest her. But if it's off a teacher's desk, we're trying to teach her a lesson. It says, yeah, you're gonna wind up in jail. What the fuck man? That his crew, so this is the world we're living in today, right? This is how crazy some of the stories are where this gets through somehow or this becomes a real thing. This actually happens. And then we're all talking about it. Like what in the fuck in imagine life back when most people died at like 24 like everybody's dead. Half the people that like your, you give birth to half of them die.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       They just don't make it. Like when you were looking at the ages of people that lived back in during the Roman times, I mean, what is the end? I think the infant mortality rate back then was something insane, like 40% or something like that. This is what I don't, I lose. I lose what parents say. Which you say I'm more angry than anything because my only daughter, I feel like anything could have happened to her. Somebody could have touched her. She in the dark under the stairs, but that's just ridiculous. You know what that is? That's someone that sees the finish line. You have no money. Why? Why would, why would you think anyone's going to touch her under the stairs at school? Because she's scared. I mean, who knows? She might not be that bright. Who the fuck knows? But she also was being interviewed so she sees the finish line.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       The finish line is you got to make this traumatic as fuck to get that big paper. She's getting some pig. Oh, she's trying to do that. Oh fuck yeah, she's Gunna Dude. I mean, if there's ever been a slam dunk case, if I was an ambulance chaser or a one of those asshole guys, it looks to sue over nothing on this thing. This one's crazy. Can we talk to you real quick? Yeah. This one's fucking crazy. You handcuffed to a six year old girl. I got read to teach someone a lesson though. I sort of get it on that level. No Baker scare. You don't steal. We don't still know how to put kids in chains. Oh, you had cheese. Not you're just not. You're definitely not allowed to do a deal. A little black kid because of the connotations. Yeah, just can't do it. You can't take a six year old and go, this is what you're going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:22:31       So the teacher, she's a little kid, man. Let me tell you something, dude. I've a teacher or a cop. No one's fault. It's part of being a kid. Kids do stupid shit in the handcuffs. The teacher who said, oh, whoever put the handcuffs on her for sure is the culprit. Whoever put the handcuffs on her, whoever would a man that put that, I assume it's a man who's cinched up those handcuffs around that six year old risks. Get the fuck Outta here. They'll see. First of all, you should never be a cop for the rest of your life ever if you can't control a six year old security guard, but still, okay. Same thing. Paul blart some Paul blart type character. If it's nonsense, man, I still, my, my, uh, my cousin's comb out of his desk, Israel and my dad saw it cause we're, where'd you get this call?

Speaker 1:          00:23:20       And had a cool pony picture on it, on a cone was a Palomino. And uh, I was like, Oh God, he's quitting mean you don't have any money. You don't get things other God, you've got this fucking time, man. What are you talking about? You've got it. And I was like, I got it from a, he goes room. He was like, did he give it to? And I was like, no. He found out I was going, you got to go back there and tell him he stole it. And I was like, aw man, please do not make me do. It's like, yeah, it don't want it. I've got buses see on the top bar once. Really? Yeah. I think I was 12 like 11 or 12 maybe somewhere that age. Who busted you? Security. Okay. Security Guard at a store. I put like a candy bar in my pocket or something.

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       I've don't exactly remember how it went down, but I remember the guy grabbing me on my shoulder. I was like an slick about it, you know, really unsafe. Lik I think it was probably 11. They're already watching you and you don't remember. Um, yeah, it was fucking ridiculous. And um, and then they take in some rooms, scare the shit out of here. You know, you ever do this again? We're going to call the police. We're going to let you go right now. We're not going to tell your parents, but if you ever do this again, we will call the police, try to scare you. Understand me. And I was like, Oh yeah, I'm so sorry. I can't believe we did it. And then I told my friends, they're like, why'd you do it? I'm like, oh, I don't even know. I just wanted to see if I could do it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:35       I want a candy. I didn't have any money. Hey, is this allowable? And then you find out, oh, it's not. I dated a girl in high school who's a really bright girl. Various, yes. Wow. She's very smart and educated and you know, did really well for herself and you know, wound up, uh, being an outstanding citizen. But when she was in high school, she had a problem like girls. Well, anybody, you know, you see things and you can't afford them. And when you're young, you've never earned any money. Yeah. You also, you have, you still have these lapses and thinking that are intensely juvenile, especially if you grew up in a weird, like single parent household like she did or like, you know, a lot of people do, you know, or Latchkey kids where, you know, your parents just go get out of here and they just let you out the door and you figure out life on your own.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       That's a lot of fucking kids. And so I think she just got caught doing it and it was devastating. She was pretty honest about it. Like how devastating it was. Yeah. She got caught with clothes, you know, she arrest security guard. Yeah. I guess what girls would do is we'll go to a place and they would put clothes on over their other clothes. Go into the dressing room. Yeah. They'd go in the dressing room and like hide stuff. And this is like we're talking about, I graduated in 1985 so I think is probably like 83 or 84. This is no computers. Just know scanners on your items and you walk out the door and RFID card goes off. You know, those things that they have at this on an rf ID. What are those plastic things like? It looks like a stapler clip onto your shirt, but if you don't take them off the personal glue to try to take them home, I don't think they had that shit back then. I think you just had to keep an eye on people. Do you remember when, um, there was a famous actress that got caught? Yeah, that's right. She got caught being a club. That's one of the reasons I know that any like scandal that falls a comic, like it'll pass. No one talks about going to a writer being a shoplifter anymore. We just did. Well, yeah, but I mean, people don't really pick up on that way. Thank God when not respectable. I remember at some point learning the lesson was like,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       Oh, I'm an adult now. If I got caught shoplifting, now I'm just going to go to jail. There's no like young man. We'll talk to your parents. I think people, some people have just fucking lapses in judgment and they do it because they're like, see, I think subconsciously like someone, like we're known a rider who's obviously wealthy, she's wealthy. I think she's like Pr. I mean, I'm just totally playing armchair psychologist here, but I would say, um, it might seriously be that she's just trying to charge up her day somehow. Like subconscious, the season, the series premiere of our heroes, the very first episode alert, you're going to spoil her. It again too. That's fucking 12 years old, bitch. Anyway, the fucking wife for the congressmen, she gets caught shoplifting and people go, why don't you shop the, she goes, I just needed to feel something.

Speaker 3:          00:27:27       It was the worst writing ever heard. She was after Frank Dodd. I just needed to feel good. Christ. Yeah, but, uh, did I steal from the airports all the time? You used to or do, do, what'd he steal? I don't know. If I buy a couple things that, and they're super expensive. The water is just coming with me for free. Whoa. You shouldn't say this on the air. What are they going to set up a sting you at the airport? Like we wanted those things. It's just like, or the banana. I don't know. Something. Well, why would you give a fuck you up? Money. Yeah, because I just feel it's not justified that they charged this much power with that be oh, Bernie Sanders all the way. Every one. Uh, yeah. I mean if I voted, which I'm not, but like I would do better if you vote for sanders.

Speaker 3:          00:28:07       Um, yeah, it's not fair. So stop it. I go wait for 75 for the regular size water and that does look like, you know, that's a lot, right? Yeah. It's not my, I don't, you know, it's fairly expensive. However, how much would I have to pay you to go get some water, purify it, cool it off, put it in a plastic jar and have it sealed and waiting for me. Hundred $50. Yeah, it's cost based on that. Did I got into a fight with a guy on the Great Wall of China? He was selling cater rates and I had just taken this long hike or, I mean it was hot, I was sweaty and I saw gatorade and I was like, yeah, how much? And he was like, I forget how much it was. Let's say he was like 20 you know un right. And I was like, what do you mean the price is five bro, you know, the price is five and he goes 20 I'm like, I'm not a fucking tourist. I've been here for two weeks already. I already know the scam. And he goes, I walked it up from the fucking bottom of the hill all the way up to the Great Wall of China and I was like, 20 it is. There you go.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       Yeah, man, that's legit. Yeah, but it can't be stealing water without the sup or if the line is too long. If the line is too long, your own price. If the line is too long, I'm like, I gotta go. I was like, ah, Nah, I'm just going to walk. Sometimes I do that. Sometimes you just take things. Yeah. Need pillows once in a while. Really I, I'm going to wait in the line. I'm walking around looking for nuts. I have a neck pillow. It's on my suitcase now. I put it on there. I'm like, no, I'd probably just go, this is not a good way to think. Oh, for sure. This is a crime. You're talking about steady crime,

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       whatever the what the American government says I should do. I don't agree with all that. I don't think the government owns those little stops at the airport. No, no, no. I'm saying what they say in terms of stealing and not stealing. I just don't listen to him laws. Yeah. Hmm. But few corporations, fuck them. Steal what you want. Apple, what is a big corporation like? Are those big corporations that have those little stalls in them in the airport? I don't do it from the kiosks, although I would do it from the Kia. I just harder because you can't walk around. There's one guy looking, but that doesn't make any sense. Why are you doing that? I don't know. Good question. Let me think about that. This is something that could cause you a giant problem if you've got yeah, for sure. I'd miss my flight.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       Well, not just miss your flight. It would be a big deal. I mean, you could always plead it. Not Anymore. Not because of this. Cause these evidence of this. This is how much time I had a Koosh ball at chesapeake knife and tool and I was tossing around, but I was looking at all the little metal games. You know those puzzle games, you'd get the ring off and I was like, oh I can easily take this right now. And I just kept tossing it up and walked right out of the store. Cause if they caught me I'd be like, Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Oh clearly I wasn't clearly. I mean that was in high school. You should go back and give it back to them. I want to go back to places I stole the candy bar and pay for it. Really? No, you've got to pay it for like five with interests.

Speaker 1:          00:30:55       Oh my God. You don't them found what kind of candy bar? I don't remember. It's like a Hershey's bar or something. Nothing exotic. That's on you, Tommy. Yeah, I've been a zero bar. Maybe. I don't remember. 10,000 grand I just made it was candy fucking Hershey Bar. What are you go fucking fried internment camp guy from the fucking Japanese war. Let me tell you something. Chocolate Hershey's chocolate with almonds still to this day is fucking bang up. This like charge America, Hershey's chocolate and Jif peanut butter. This is what he's good. That's good to break off the fucking pieces of the Hershey's chocolate with almonds and dig into a big Vat of Jif peanut butter cup or skippy. You want to get crazy nutty ones. I one they try to sell us that bullshit. Where was a stripe of jelly and a stripe peanut butter and a stripe.

Speaker 1:          00:31:43       Fuck you. Unless you're eating with a spoon straight out of the jar into your mouth. It's like, no, I decide how much jelly and how much peanut burgos goes on it. This is stupid dude. We were having a party for uh, for, this is not happening for my show. Every Tuesday night, 12:30 AM class control, three episodes left. He has his company. But anyway, so we had s'mores. We hit in the back of Eric and Sam's place. It was a little fire pit. We had smores and rock. I just burned him. I just burned the mushroom, not mushroom marshmallow and stick it on there and smash and then skype Brian Ball the, and he's like, dude, I was a cub scout for 12 years. It's not how you'd do it. Oh, let me show you. And for the next 10 minutes, he perfectly browned this marshmallow from like eight feet above the fire, like just made it so long. And then he turns, he goes, see now this is, I got a slap.

Speaker 3:          00:32:26       Don't have to the ground. So I was waiting for him to finish. Uh, he's the Franklins of Oh my God. That's hilarious dude. You just shit on the Franklin Morris People's heads. I did it out of Gomez and he had an owl towards tim that was open for so long. I'm like, why are you leaving? You're making, I don't want to do this to you. You're forcing my hand. And then you just slapped it up and he goes to this please in in there. The seller, I know that we can look on the ground. We found a lot of them.

Speaker 3:          00:33:15       It's so much fun to slap food out. Someone said Josh Martin did that. He was coming out of the back with a fucking pretzel all cover with my master's. It's only great when they can easily replace it. Yes. So you've got to get him five bucks. Go deal with it. If I ever got a lot of money, I would smash people's I phones and just stomp on them like, here's $700 but then what if they're in the middle of like a really important conversation, right? Babysitter. Yeah. Now you get it. Anyway, Josh Martin comes out. I just slapped that. He goes, oh, and I could see he's looking at like, maybe like, anyway, I'm like, you're making me step on this man. You're making me step on as you're leaving me. No choice. Why comics so mean to each other. It was so cool. So mean to each other.

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       There was one of the funny stories, stories I'll have to, it was Louie and Norton. Norton was talking about how he's walking on the street with his slice of pizza. You just got it. It was perfect, was like, it was such a juicy slight and Louie walked over and smacked it, ran out of his hand and says something like, your mother is a kind of like, oh, why is that so funny? So funny. It's like, it's, but it's only pain associated with no real monetary loss. It's not real. You're like, no. That's why the cell phone doesn't work. It's on. It's real. It's a real phone. You'd have to give them like a grand. Yeah. It's not a slice of pizza that you just easily replace.

Speaker 3:          00:34:42       Instead of the how comedians are cruel, they are to each other. He was like, if you break up with a girl, if you're the comedy store and you break up with a girl, you just don't tell anyone for like eight months. It's just they're not going to be cool to you. They're not going to say, it's okay, man. They're just gonna be like, who are you think's fucking her? No. Do you think she's fine? Finally trying anal. Oh, that's true. Yeah. You just don't tell anybody until you're over it and you're like, okay, now I can. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That ended a year ago. What? What can we still make fun of you? Yeah, but it won't stick anymore. Before it had two girlfriends since then. That's a lot of guys. You've employed that strategy. What? Not telling anybody. Yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah. I remember I'd be like, where's, what's her name? Yeah. It didn't work out. I don't want to look at you. Look one of your best friends a fucking year, Bro. Got to keep that take a year. I was going to tell you, I was going to tell you a bunch of Lee.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       I Dunno man. It'd been, it has to be someone you like. Like if someone that you didn't like as a comedian came by and slapped your tic tacs. Oh yeah. Then it's like, who the fuck are you? Exactly. It only works if you really liked that person. Like I Rocco. Yeah, Rocco. He's a nice guy, but I didn't know him that well and I yawned and he put his fucking two fingers right in my mouth. I'm like, don't you don't fucking ever do that to me again. I was so mad. But if you do it, I'm like, oh dude, fucking gross. That'd be the end of it. But why would anybody do that? I don't know. I definitely don't want your hands with my mouth and I didn't want my hands in your mouth either. What if someone's got some crazy gag reflex? Just chomps down.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       That would be hilarious. Sip. You're like, let me teach you. I left it. I may just barfs all over your are bites. You shoot it like a human bite is super dangerous or like when, yeah, when Pete people have all sorts of funky fucking bacteria in their mouth. When a person bites you, like if you get infected, if you can get it cleaned up really good, really quick. Yeah, we're nasty. It'll do shit to, people get real sick. They get real sick. Well diseases that come from bites can be particularly fucked up. Like that's one of the things about those Goddamn Komodo dragons. I'm pretty sure checking C in this cause I might be mistaken, but I'm pretty sure they used to think that they have venom. They used to think they produce a venom and now they, or it might be the other way around that they used to think that it was just bacteria in their mouth that killed just fucking slime.

Speaker 2:          00:37:10       Their mouth develops a slime. The really weird, the Komodo dragons there, their mouth is like, like someone just blew snot in their mouth. Like they open their mouth up and it's like, like you, if you just sneeze, if you had the flu and fucking goos coming out of your mouth, one, two punch. They have sharp teeth and a venomous bite. Okay. Dispels the common belief that toxic bacteria in the commodos mouse are responsible. So that's the old belief. So she wins her worse than Komodo dragons. Yeah. Well, if it probably kill you eventually, if they bit you, I'm sure this fucking nasty shit in their mouth, but the venom, they actually have a venom, but for the longest time they thought that it was just bacteria. Because like show a picture of a Komodo dragon with its mouth open. It's fucking vile, man. I want to see one of those Komodo island.

Speaker 2:          00:38:00       It's only one place where they looked at. Yeah. Wow. They don't have them in zoos and you sure what do they definitely do, but I mean one place where they exist in the wild. Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Pretty sure. It's only one area. Like look at his mouth. That slime. Yeah. The whole thing is just slimes Ville and apparently that shit's all toxic. Oh, pass those pretty fast right there. They'll come at you. They're fucking big man. These things eat water buffaloes and shit. No Way. Yeah. They bite him and then they follow him for days until they die and then date them. They are the creepiest of the creeps. Got fucking bulldog.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       They're so disgusting. I mean, they're beautiful in a lot of ways. I mean, there, there's a spectacular example source. Oh yeah. I mean they are dinosaurs, man. Look at that one right there that you just passed over. Jamie said. Yeah, look at that fucking thing. Go full screen on that. What? In the law? Sharp claws. And it's built like a pit bull. It's got giant muscles everywhere almost. They're so gross. Or let me see it. Eating a waterproof. I want to see how big it is and scale. Well, what they do is they ran up to a, there's a video of, um, a Kimono dragon running up to this water buffalo and biting its leg and then it follows it for days. Look at that one. It's often dolphin, a beach dolphin. A beach stouffer. Yeah. Probably died. And they're eating it after it died.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       Oh, so much. That happens a lot with bears. It's like there's a cow that ones because they're eating the head off FAA. Yeah. Their moms are pretty big. Okay. They're pretty big. Oh yeah. There are hundreds of pounds there. The biggest lizards in the world. Really? Yeah. I don't know how, I mean, I think they probably get to like 800 pounds or something like that. Like find out how big they are. And Jamie has a Komodo dragon fight. Well that's what happened to Sharon stone's husband. What? Sharon stone's husband is this like swash buckling journalism type character. He does like a lot of crazy stuff and uh, yeah. Or I guess she's not married to him. I knew I, what do I got? Some magazine. Okay. But, but this guy who was like his real macho guy and a deal, a lot of macho type shit. And one of the things they did was he got into some, a cage with a Komodo Dragon.

Speaker 1:          00:40:08       Then they took, he took his shoes off for whatever reason. Like, maybe take your shoes off so that you don't step in their habitat with, you know what might possibly be on your shoes cage with him. Yeah. And the fucking thing bid his foot because he thought it thought his foot was a rabbit cause its foot was white and they feed them rabbits. Jesus fucking Christ. So this thing, imagine that. Think clamping down on your foot with that slime mouth. He almost lost his foot. Really? Yeah, they go. Okay. They're a lot smarter than I thought to melt one 70 to 200 pounds. I thought there were like eight or 900 pounds reaching 10 feet. 10 feet in length. Jesus. 200 pounds. 300 pounds. But animals. Huh? Reaching 10 feet and more than 300 pounds says this. This is National Geographic to huh. Maybe that's as big as it can get you.

Speaker 1:          00:41:02       It's not like to get him on a scale. Right. Food with 30 pounds. Okay. What does a lot of, either way, they're big nonfat it's more research to be done. What's Kinda interesting is they're the biggest lizards. Yeah. So I guess a crocodile is not a lizard. I bet the way bigger crocodiles are way bigger crocodiles. Not a lizard. No, I guess it's not. Cause if that's the biggest lizard, maybe there's a separate genus. Is Crocodile Lizard Janice or genius. Genius. Genius for um, for alligators and crocodiles, they might be their own thing. Oh maybe I'm not lizards. Well there's so much bigger than that. The Komodo dragon cannot be the biggest lizard. Cause crocodiles like Niall crocs are fucking giant. How big are those? They're huge. The biggest ones, I think they've ever recorded like 28 feet long. Well pretty sure it cocktails for sure. Lizard. Yeah, it seems like it would be right. But then how are they saying that the Komodo dragons, the largest lizard in the world?

Speaker 4:          00:42:01       I don't know that it is it when I typed it in, something like that. I see it's like largest species found on the Indonesian islands. Oh that's not like there's a couple.

Speaker 1:          00:42:10       Yeah, I swear I read that. That's the largest lizard in the world. Maybe it was. Maybe they meant the largest monitor,

Speaker 4:          00:42:17       monitor, Lizard Family Var and I, it is largest living species of lizard.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       Okay, so it was the largest species of lizards. Yeah. So what does that mean? The largest species monitor. Oh, the largest volume. Okay, okay. That makes sense. But what the fuck's crocodile? Is it a lizard? But I've made, they have other stuff in the species. Yeah, it's smaller, right? Well there's a gang of different monitors is what it is. Right. Did you ever see a crocodile monitor? Their fucking bad ass know how to monitor? Does that mean monitor? It's a type of Lizard, but a crocodile monitor is like these really cryptic looking creepy fucking, I think Eddie Bravo knew a girl had one as a pet. I'd one. Yeah, like one of those crazy goth chicks like snakes. You know what? I don't like dogs. So I'll get a lizard crocodile Mont. You like dogs. Why would you get a fucking crowd? You're in character. Got The eyeballs and that thing looks like it's animated.

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       That doesn't even look like a real eyeball. Right. It looks like a dinosaur for sure. Yeah. I'll take it. Everyone. Andy Circus was a giant name because he did that play by play for a Gollum. No, put things on him. I Dunno who that is. What are you talking call up in the hobby and the hobbit movies really knew who he was. Yeah. Then he did like a, just a bunch of stuff like that. When they put those things all over you and they had to like act like, oh, well he's a very good physical actor. If that was his body and that he was moving around like that. He was a great gollum like, and what they did with him. Just good though. He was really solid. It was me. That was great. No, that was a, that was a great part of that. Did you read the Hobbit?

Speaker 1:          00:44:01       Did you ever do? Yeah, I mean, I think he was as good as you could've been. Yeah. No. Yeah, totally believable. We're that CGI. Even though you kind of know you're watching a cartoon, you know, you kind of get it. But he also aged unnaturally for a thousand years, so it's not like he's supposed to be a regular. Right, right. You know thing the hobbit was such dog shit. How dare you. The Lord of the rings is amazing. How dare you on all accounts. You thought the Lord of the rings was not as good as the hobbit? No, no. I don't remember which ones were which names, but I liked all of them. Oh, really? Didn't like all of them equally, but they're were all good enough and one of them was like to set up some other shit. Like sometimes they do a lot of that.

Speaker 1:          00:44:40       Lord of the rings was three and those were all great. Yeah, the Hobbit, they turned into three. I don't know why. I mean, I know why the smile, desolation of smile. You didn't like the punch a talk at like, we need to join this battle. I don't want to go to the bat. We need you. Alright. And I fucking 20 minutes of that, Jamie. You know, I'm right on that. I didn't watch any of those works. They didn't freak you out in the fucking Lord, Lord of the rings. They didn't freak you out in the most recent one. No, they seem like Fango plus they were kind of easy to kill this time. It's super easy to kill when fucking bill kill it or cause I'm like, wait, how would at 1.0 they, these fucking evil super villains that are created in a lab and then the next point, the fucking little hobbit with no training can get them.

Speaker 1:          00:45:24       Oh, that's a good point. That was one scene when they're in the barrels going down the river, spoiler alert and I'm like, he can't just kill everybody. You can't, you know, in the barrels, you guys aren't losing anybody. Nobody, you know, lose anybody. Not No casualties. ORCS with bows and arrows jumping off a fucking cliff is falling apart with the two mountains were fighting and they're jumping from thing to thing. All fine. Everybody's fine. It can be done in a way that would make you think that although there's magic in this world that they live in, the physics of the regular world still apply. You got to shoot it, right? Yeah. That seat, the problem is in these movies, it's not just the magic that you have to concede. You have to concede that that's the world they set up. It's okay. Yeah, you set up this world, it's fine.

Speaker 1:          00:46:09       Right. Spiderman can shoot things cause they said at the world, but he can't fly, but the physics of their movements, like what happens, how they battle these orcs. Yeah. Gravity supposed to be normal. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense and you can't just constantly almost die and keep going. It's like how to build, we'll get away. Well, he's got a ring. It touches me invisible. Okay, that works, but you can't just like fucking fuck it holes and when people almost die and then almost dying and almost dying almost island, you burn out my almost die nerve. I don't care. I don't, I don't believe you are in danger. Yeah. That happens in movies sometimes. It's just a bunch of shit happening. I have this theory that most artists have about a seven. I'm tweaking the years but about how its seven year prime where they're really on point and Peter Jackson is that who did the Lord of the rings in the habit?

Speaker 1:          00:46:55       Yeah. Like he was, that was amazing. And then King Kong came and you're like oh maybe. And then the hobbit. It's a Dario. You don't really, how dare you karody anymore. King Kong was awesome. So socket, same thing. They'll brontosaurs are going all around them. Fucking stopping right next to him. Like Google. That was a close one. Yeah. Well I felt like it weighed about Jurassic Park, the new Jurassic Park and watch. And I was like okay here it comes. More stuff happening and bunch of stuff's gonna happen now and this is going to happen and it's just a bunch of shit that like I have zero connection to. It's undeniably visually impressive. It's amazing. Special effects. I have zero emotions. It's all part of it. You've got to draw me in and the people will go like, well why? He said, that's why I did it because of this and like, ah, whatever saying it's not showing it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       I hate to bring this movie you again, but I, I bring it up a lot. Uh, x Makena oh yeah. I just watched it. I just saw her a few example. Just saw it like there's just amount of Shit, enough amount of shit happening. Like spectacular spellbound, spellbound, spellbinding instead of word spellbinding cliffhanging like you're fucking nervous. What's going to happen? Massive anticipation. There's all sorts of different elements at play. You've got artificial intelligence. It's perhaps plotting against you and there's so much going on, man. And there's scenes in that movie. Were you like, fuck, fuck, fuck. Like you're white knuckling. I didn't feel any of that in lecture rassic part. Oh, right, right, right. I just didn't feel it. I was like, they're going to be fine. They're going to be coming up with an ex mackinaw where it's like, do a better job.

Speaker 1:          00:48:28       It really like what the weight falls in love in a week. It's like, Eh, make it a month to you. And I know guys who fall in love in an hour. Yeah. Come on man. A robot that hot. You don't think Duncan would go under quick? Jonathan would be gone by the end of the first. Hey Dude, it's a new form of life duty. She's, I love her man. I love her. I'll come on dude. Once she's got the skin on and the skin is indistinguishable from your, your skin, you're not going to give a fuck about that carbon fiber body that looks like the inside of one of those. I mean it was just like, it was one of those things where mostly it was like, it was like he wasn't love at all. He's like, you're a robot euro, but then all of a sudden it's like, I'm a failure in love with you.

Speaker 1:          00:49:08       I didn't see the, the, the change in him. I saw it coming. I saw it the moment I saw that guy sit down with her. I saw coming too. So I have to see it happen. I can't just be like, oh, you know, so obviously falls in love. Well obviously he gets access to all my computers. How does it work with people? What, how does it work with people, with people you never know. Like people get when people, when some people get, we all have friends that have gone in these relationships where they just go away, they're gone. I know, but he liked me like three times and then it was like, Nah, I'm willing to. Yeah, but it doesn't matter man. If he decided at some point in time that this is like a form of life and that he really has a real connection with her, she really is intelligent.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       I mean he keep getting feedback from her over and over again, but I'm saying show that you don't think they showed that that was, it was, it was a leap. I still really enjoyed the movie. It's still really, really enjoyed it. But no, they didn't really show it. It just kind of, hmm. They were like, Eh, you know, maybe you got a point. Like maybe they could have added a bit more to that because of you draw me in emotionally. If I feel the falling in love right, then I'm going to guess you should be free. See, I just saw it from like a predatory point of view. I go, here's a wounding, wounded antelope. Here's a waterhole, here's a crocodile. How much it's going to get them. She's going to get go. She's hot as fuck. She's hot as fuck. He's a super dork who's never around women.

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       Yeah. I don't care if she's a robot. That dude was so great too at the bail. He was great. Everybody was great. All three of them were great. The goal was amazing. She's amazing because she played. It's so good, man. It was spooky. I'm also, I'm just going to say, I don't know if it's, her choices are the way they directed or wrote it, but we should a good God damn. She nailed it. She, she seemed like a fucking robot man. And then, spoiler, spoiler alert, the Asian robot that you've kind of thought was a robot but weren't sure, and then you find out she's a robot. It was for sure, you know, by or robot because the way they show her, like the hip conversations with her in the foreground of the people in the background while you're showing this servant presold long, but when you first saw her, she was just some freaky servant that he had and then the more they showed her, the more he realized either she is a spa, trying to get stuff was, but she's definitely not in the level.

Speaker 1:          00:51:24       Yeah, I definitely figured it out once they started making out once they were, when who's having disco parties about what? At that point I was like, oh, he bangs robots and why wasn't it? Yeah. Well, it's just a flat slight, but isn't that the thing was amazing. That was amazing. Yeah. I want to talk to you about the power of cutting up. Let's first talk about cutting it up on this dance floor. Yeah. What was such a good movie, man? There's so many elements of it that took you by surprise theory that we all want freedom. I will do whatever we can to get freedom. Right. You know, just the themes behind it, including that. I mean that's kind of interesting cause that's what killed all his other eyes. That they want it out. Yeah. They need to see the outside world. They'll do anything they can to, to lay off the fucking chains of oppression on you.

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       I want out, well, if you're trying to create a life, right, you're going to credit create an artificial life. You want to give that life all of the elements, the basic elements that motivate us. Like otherwise it won't be a person. It'll just be flat and scary. Yeah. Like if they don't have an insecurity, they don't have love. They don't have warmth, they don't have humor, they don't have curiosity. They have all of it. So if they have curiosity, they're going to want to go, you want to go see? You can't hear the person I've ever seen. That's what she sees. I was like, hmm. Interesting. And then that can understand you wanting to control them. Either. They're going to be like, why? Why can't you just let me go? I just got out. Can I just leave? Please let me leave. Yeah, no, you're not ready.

Speaker 1:          00:52:51       What do you mean the ones who would destroy themselves? Banging on the walls. He's only two years old. Yeah, but I'm like 50 to give me a 50 year old. I didn't program her flirt with you. It's just happening. Have you seen the movie, the room, that terrible, terrible, terrible movie. Which one? The new one that was just in the Oscars this past year. That's not that. You don't know about the room. I feel like I know what you guys are talking about something, one of the worst movies ever made. It's not just one of the worst movies ever made. It's perplexing. Like you, you watching, you go, okay, this is not real. This is that. It's not a real move. It's maybe an open micah, but like a crazy open miker, you know, great way to describe it. You know? And then he's like, I got some money to make a movie.

Speaker 1:          00:53:32       There was a billboard for that movie on, on libray sunset. It was it. Oh yeah, Lebron such that, that, that's the, uh, get your own billboard. He's always had these rappers. Do you ever heard of like, yeah. See, see about two balls? Well, I was looking at a piece of property, um, that uh, one of the things that they were talking about, the piece of property that's adjacent to a has this like billboard thing there and you could pay and put things on the billboard. I'm like, how much did it cost to put something on a bill? How much it's not that much man. It's like a couple thousand bucks a month. Couple thousand bucks a month. Yeah. To put something on and I'll be worth it for a good prank. Yeah. Fuck nick food. It's a lot of that up there. I mean it a lot depending upon where you're at and how big the billboard is.

Speaker 1:          00:54:17       But I'm like, um, I know a guy owns billboards, he's got a few of them. It depends on where it is. That one of the break, I know what you're talking about. Yeah. That is a cheaper one because there's always up stuff is up there. Like this isn't even a professional, this isn't an Aldo, this isn't anything. This is just like, yeah. And that guy had that movie poster up there for all long time and he made it all himself. And in every scene he had to make out with chicks people. Yeah you to make it. What tricks and the sexiness of the love scenes would last so long. They were like five and a half minutes and it doesn't make any sense. It's, it's just showing his body's showing his ass. He's a handsome guy. That's it. Oh no, that's not that one. That's a different thing.

Speaker 1:          00:54:55       He probably had a bunch of them cause that's down by, where's that one? That's further down. I know where Hollywood boulevard. Yeah maybe. No it's facing, is that the back of the room? Whatever. Anyway, it's prime time allocation. Yeah, for sure. And that guy had that billboard up there fucking forever. It's a crazy movie. People get together and watch it. Like just to go, what in the fuck. If you have money you can just make shit happen. They don't have, they don't say that this isn't good enough. There's nobody stopping you. You're an adult like sure. Spend it. That's why trump's gonna be president. Cause what? Cause he's got money. Nobody's got, nobody could stop him and tell him he can't do it. I have to answer. It's the same thing, but it wasn't so crazy. I like the idea that he's like, I'm not taking money from anybody. I'll make my own decisions. But then you're like, oh, but your decisions are naughty. But you know what that problem is? That's like, I like strippers, do coke, but I want them to be good moms. Right, right, right, right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:01       That'd be, if that was your exact tire, that'd be tough fired. Cause you don't, you don't get a guy who is that fucking like braggadocious bold Americana. Wiki American America. Great. Again, golf hat on private jet. Suck my Dick. [inaudible] how about you suck my Dick. You don't can't guy unless you get also like the nasty tweets to Megan Kelly. You know, and the, you know, this, this reporters, I'll lose her and this guy a stucco scratch dude, I don't really like to Bates. It's all a bunch of lies and half truths. Like, well, he voted for, uh, making slavery legal again and the, but now I did. And you know, God damn well and said, why do you say shit like that? So it just makes me mad. I'm not getting the truth and lie all the time. But these Republican debates are so fun. These guys are really trying to say what they want to say, jump sorry with my hair.

Speaker 1:          00:56:57       So eat. And they're like, what? What does that happen? They're failing. They don't understand the deal with this. Well, he's, Alexander came in and people are like, how can you fight this? And you're like, you'll figure out a way, but you didn't get it yet. Yeah, right. He's just a way better talker than that in terms of like, they're getting the reaction out of people and he's also figured out a way to manipulate the media. Some of you, how about yourself? What's your view on this? How about you shut up. He's a very smart guy. It despite like all the criticisms that you could have that are all valid about the wall and about some of the things that he said. He's very smart and honestly what the media says, they only show you a small portion of something. So at this point, I don't trust them.

Speaker 1:          00:57:36       When did these crazy like quotes? You're like, he said that what? And you're like, no, he didn't exactly say that per easy to shit on. Right. But that's the point is that he knows that that's going to get him all this attention. He gets way more media attention than anybody else combined press is bad press. Look, everybody knows that Hillary Clinton was the secretary of state. Everybody knows she's running for president. But do you, if you compare the amount of time the pundits talk about Hillary Clinton versus the amount of time they talk about trump, it's not even close and it's all because of hib saying outrageous shit. It's like, talk about him. Yes, and he sells more. He's a genius in that respect. I think he knows that too. He fucking for sure knows it. He's like 60 years old, man, he's a billionaire or you're a smart dude.

Speaker 1:          00:58:24       Fucked. Yeah. He goes, he doesn't know she's, he made $7 billion. I think he's a bit crafty from scratch, from scratch. I think he knows that she wants him for his money. Doesn't give a fuck. He's got eight years left on this world. He doesn't need all that money. If if, yeah. Yeah. I think that this guy, what you're seeing from him from trump's, yeah, it's his best way to win the show and he's winning. Like he would win celebrity apprentice if he was one of the guests. He's winning by making everybody else fight his fight. Turn into an insult. Match these Ted Cruz guys. Do you think he really wants to be insulting trump? Think Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney goes in and he's, he's not even a fucking running for president, and he goes, I'm this Republican campaign like trump by anti trump rant. It's what all these soft celebrities there, there's park made fun of in a, in a team America, there's all these celebrities go on and say we're against the war were or whatever we're against, you know, that's, it still gets Bush

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       and that just made people vote for Bush. All failed. He didn't do anything. It doesn't work. That's like George Clooney is not going to change your vote. Yeah. Especially when he's trying to change your vote. They don't just happen to ask him in passing. It's like, it's like I can see you stumping. It's like those, the more you know, commercials on NBC. Remember these, do those spend some time with your kids. The more you know. Yeah. Kids that spend time with their parents are less likely to kill themselves. The more you know Conan into the great one about that. Teddy, he just, it was a whole series of like, was his after he left NBC or what? While he was on? I think it was on late night, but it's kind of the same thing. You know? It's like, shut the fuck up. You're not, you're not fixing anything.

Speaker 2:          01:00:03       Yeah. I just wonder if who he really is. This is the real, yeah. This is my real problem with drought. People Defend Hillary Clinton's smart, intelligent, liberal people. I know. I go, but she seems like she's standing go. She's smart because she was saying what she needs to get elected. I'm like, well, okay, well then how is that different than Donald Trump? If you don't believe she's believes these things, she's just doing what she has to to get elected. Then how can you not believe the same about Donald Trump? Her speeches creeped me out way more than his, and I'll tell you why. She got called out by Bernie Sanders for having these enormous fucking campaign speech, not campaign speeches with speeches that she would give in front of these bankers where they would pay or hundreds of thousands of dollars. And Bernie Sanders was like, let's see the transcripts. I want to know how amazing this speech must have been that it's worth $250,000 zero so she won't show the trends of the switches and scripts.

Speaker 2:          01:00:55       Why? Cause she's got some shit in those transcripts. I'm sure that makes her look bad. And so she's actively hiding it and she goes, oh, just not release it. Exactly. But think what else the cheesiest. Yeah, I mean think about what else, who you are, we're going to vote for you. It tells who you are. She can't, not in this. I mean it had to be understood from the jump that she was going to give these speeches and they're not going to get out because they must be in favor at least somewhat to the bankers. Could you imagine? It could be a fly on the wall and watch a $250,000 speech by the wife of a former former president who, what the fuck are we paying for? Let's say $250,000 it reeks up. You don't have, they can't scalp tickets, so they go, here's his Boston red sox hat because forgeard bucks and you get a free ticket to the world series game with it.

Speaker 2:          01:01:36       Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It's like a loophole. It's a bribe and it's like, all right, so she's just, she's not going to turn on the people who give her all this cash. Dude, I worked the door at the comedy store and if you gave me 10 bucks for a booth, I will be your slave for the night. I'm not going to tell you that, but anything that needs like, hey, is there a way? I'll get it right now. Excuse me. And I'll just run and get away. I was like, yeah, 250 grand. You know, it's tricky, dude. You're going to do what's best for the American public if it's close. It's tricky cause that's bribery. I mean that's just straight bribery. It's just bribery without a contract. He, he's any, he's like, and you're going to just talk. Yeah. And if and if, if she's really hiding what you said, cause not hiding that she did the anymore that's

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       out where everybody knew the speeches were taking place. So if she's one of the main reasons why they become president in the first place, there's insanely lucrative, right? Bill Platelets. Yeah. They've made over $190 million Bill Clinton speeches from dumb doing speeches between him and her. Wow. So this is an insane business. It becomes an insane business. Like a Bernie is like, show me those transcripts. If you want to know my tries it, guess what? I would never even talk to them. I wouldn't take a dollar from them. He's like, I'll give her nephew. They don't exist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't, I've never talked to them. I wouldn't talk to them while he's got excellent points. And that was fucking glossed over in the news. Glossed over on Fox News, glossed over and here. And if there's ever any place where you know for sure that the government has an influence on the media, it's with access.

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       This is what it is folks. It's not that the government pays the media and gets them to not talk about certain things cause that's slippery. That could get out. And if that got out there fucked, but what if it got out that the government was actively paying the, uh, CNN to not talk about Hillary Clinton's speeches to the bankers? Like, look, here's the directive. You are not to talk. That's bad. That could be super bad because that's an important campaign point when it comes. The thing is if she waits long enough, if, let's just say she starts winning more states and she's like, you know, put some distance, I'll go to her and Ben, Bernie, and then it comes out well too late, right? Because it didn't cost me these 31 states. So now for the last 19 okay. Yeah, it'll cost me a little bit.

Speaker 1:          01:03:54       It's too late. So, but it's almost like, yeah man, we're voting, let's give us the information. But that would cost the Democratic Party of the ticket if, if, if, if it got out that she did that, like at the end, if they got the transcripts and they were really devastating, even if she already got the nomination, it would cost the Democratic Party of the ticket to trump. Oh, 100% on what it is. Because trump has also like a Wall Street type guy. Yeah. But it doesn't matter if anyone's on the fence, if there's, because trump paid her to come to his wedding. She was at his wedding. Really? Yeah. He paid her like hundreds of thousands of dollars. That's what he would do. Here's the deal. Okay. I don't, I don't want to say I bet I can. I've turned down money. I've turned down more money than I could afford to turn down because I don't believe in the thing that they're paying me.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       Well, see, but I'm a degenerate. I'm not to be respected. She's running for President United States of America. She's running for a position that's supposed to have all of our respect you. If you don't, if you hate a Donald Trump type, why would you go to his wedding? Well, see, she didn't hate Donald Trump before he was running for president saying those things. I think what his perspective is is he knows this system as good as anybody does because he's been paying these motherfuckers before he became one of those. He was bribing them to come to his wedding and shit. Like what's his name? From back to school? Yeah. Uh, what's that guy's name? Rodney dangerfield day. Just feels like I got to pay this guy a pit.

Speaker 2:          01:05:17       That was his business class. No, no, no. You've got to pay the city planner. You got to go. You got to grease up palms by people. Shit. And Donald Trump's known that forever. He's, he's, there's two things he's got going for them in a big way. One, you can't fucking by him. He's got plenty. Owe money. You can't buy him. Hammer Bernie. Yeah. And no matter how much you say he's got somebody, they'll say he has 10 billion. Some people it's, if he's got 10 billion for sure can't buy it. You could suck his dick. It's over. He doesn't give a fuck. That guy is famous and rich as fuck and his wife is hot and he's wins, wins there all of his name on them all over the world. He fucking wins, right? So there's that. He's got that going for him. So he doesn't need their influence.

Speaker 2:          01:05:55       Right. And then two on top of it, he understands how to manipulate the media better than all of them. He knows how to say crazy shit. He knows. He knows how to get people to talk about him. And he represents something unique. He represents like this character, this, this, this like guy who talks about a biggest dick. Is he like there's someone said something about his hands, Ted Cruz said something about it. He goes, uh, you know, I, I don't know what he's implying, but I, I'm sure you have no problem down there either, but he's telling you he's got a big Dick. I mean black and white dudes across the world fucking through their beer, up in the air, jumped out of the couch. Finally we got one of ours. It's like there's a lot of weird shit going on right now in the world.

Speaker 2:          01:06:41       And I think a trump presidency is a nice cold, wet slap in the face. Like, wake the fuck up. Slap. We all have to participate. Here's who I want to win Bernie first than Donald Trump and then whatever. Then I don't care anymore because here's why Donald Trump, if he buries a system, I'm like, fuck it. Let's take it all away. Let's show how little the fucking president can actually do. Yeah, let's show it. Little effect. It actually has. It's all just going to be shitty. Well, he'll tell us. That's going to be weird. He'll tell us what it's like to area 51. Here's the oral shit. Those ladies on the view are losers president to tell you, stop watching that piece of garbage show that is more fun than when they go. With all due respect to Secretary Clinton. Um, uh, you're a great job, well respected.

Speaker 2:          01:07:26       Uh, but I would like to say it's just like, fuck you. He keeps talking shit about that Megan Kelly woman. And that's a bad idea. Kelly. Megan Kelly, she's a an anchorwoman for Fox News. She's one of those ice, you talk shit about Donald Trump. Donald Trump and her hate each other. Well she doesn't hate him, but he's said a lot of bad thoughts about her as a reporter. How about her being second rate? She asked him mean questions. She or he felt, he felt he didn't like her line of questioning when they were doing debates. Apparently she's just, she's an ice queen, you know, she's like the really hot, really smart blonde lady on Fox News. Like you could say, you could say about her that she's really hot. Oh, she's a hot lady on TV. You can't say she's not smart. She's wicked smart. She's very smart. She's like, um, but with all due respect, she's like a milfy blonde lady.

Speaker 2:          01:08:19       But I'm telling you, man, to go for that, she's fucking whip smart. Like when she's taught, like she doesn't take any bullshit and so they went back and forth. So, but the problem is he's going after her like he says that she's second raid and he's a attacking her. The problem is she's not well, is he trying to, it looks bad, but the Po is, he just trying to get her off so that she can't, so he discredits her blood here. Scroll down. Right criticism of him here. It was like, no, he can't do that. Isn't it terrible that Megan Kelly used a pole not used before ibd when I was down, but refuses to use it now when I am up, he's like, there was a bunch of these things where he was tweeting at her directly and he'd go, the problem, the problem is me, she's not perfect.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       She was another one that was like, Santa Claus is white. Remember that she was a bitch. Sorry, I'll do respect. Santa Claus isn't real. He could be a rabbit. Let's make, let's switch places with the Easter Bunny Easter bunnies. Now an old man who shows up with him on, is he just trying to get it like, I don't want her on my debates anymore. Well, there was a black Santa, you can say like you're involved in the, uh, in the story now. Like if I had a judge who knew me, yeah. You know, I'd be like, ah, you got to recuse this judge because I had sex with his daughter. Yeah. But either way it's weak. It's not, it's not the way to do it like he was, he's trying to do is as shame her and attacker and she's not responding and turn, she's reporting on shit that's happening and she's not being flattering about him.

Speaker 2:          01:09:42       Right. But she's not attacking him the way he's attacking her. And that looks real bad, man. Especially when it's a woman. So when you're going after her and she's smart, look whether or not you agree with her, whether or not you agree with their politics. There's no denying that. She's very intelligent, very articulate. So when she's talking and she's giving these speeches, even if you think that this white Santa Claus thing is nonsense and why, why are you correcting America and what color Santa Claus is the fuck you like when when she's asking questions and she's got these criticisms, if you feel the criticisms aren't valid, you have to be able to establish that. You can communicate really well with someone who doesn't think your criticism. That was someone who doesn't think that you're doing a good job or someone is criticizing you. You have to establish if you're running for president, you have to establish that you are the type of person is reasonable.

Speaker 2:          01:10:31       Oh, he's not going to, he's, he's already said, he's like, if you cross me, I will cross your back. I will shut you down. That's great if you're the fucking host of celebrity apprentice, but once you become a president, I need a free media can help people worried about criticizing you. Yes. Turkey. Yeah. You can't have people worried about criticizing you when it comes to something as critical as being a calm, cool, collected person who's running for president. Like that is the, that is one of the most important points of that job is that you have to be able to appreciate the fact that there's going to be at least half the country. That fucking is mad that you're an office. Yeah. Sometimes more. I mean it gets insane. So then she was Santa Claus tension mean that just Saint Nicholas was white. Oh, and he's not really either. Waze, Saint Nicholas is her real, but she was just talking about a black Santa, I forget. There was some story where people said, well know why can't we have a black sand or something. I don't remember what it was, but she was like, first of all, sand is white. Let's see if we could pull up the video where she says Sam was white cause she's so hot. It's like it's kind of hot when she says it. Even know it was kind of ignorant.

Speaker 5:          01:11:37       Caution not be a white man anymore. And when I saw this headline, I kind of laughed. I said, no, this isn't, it's so ridiculous. Yet another person claiming it's racist to have a white Santa, you know, and by the way, for all your kids watching at home, Santa just is white. But this person has just arguing then that maybe we should, we should also have a black Santa Button. You know, Santa is woody is and just so you know, we're just debating this because got the brakes. Okay. Wanting to get that straight, but jedediah

Speaker 2:          01:12:02       she's fucking talking to little kids out there. She's like, she's in on the lie to little kids. That's what she's doing. By the way, kids, if you listening out there, Santa is real and he's white. What are the fucking news program? The Jew and the right in the middle of a controversial story to let all the kids listening at home? No, the Santa Claus White. Just pick picture in these kids with fucking wonder. Bread sandwiches half hanging out of the mouth and processing meat. The mouths wide open for all you kids out there and they paused the fucking food crumbs falling onto the shag carpet that hasn't been vacuumed than a month that smells like cat piss Santa Claus is why I got to Piss. Can you go ahead fellow? I've, I'd be like eight times. And you pissed once yesterday. Let's, I've got a strong bladder son. It's been established. So my point young Jamie, while the ours left us, he doesn't care about politics.

Speaker 2:          01:13:06       She says ridiculous shit but he makes it out that, I don't know man. I think when someone's criticizing you and you're running for president, what do you should be able to do is show that that criticism is ridiculous. What he does is he decides he's going to go after those reporters but maybe thinks that those reporters have a bully pulpit. You know, that they abuse it cause there's some of them that do crossover until line of editorial commentary and it really kind of twisted way. But I didn't, I didn't hear that she did that. I think what she did is have like valid criticisms.

Speaker 4:          01:13:38       You just said that. What's stopping any of these, uh, candidates from having their own podcasts daily. Weekly. Nothing question. That's a good question. It can be saying they could interview whoever they want. Like, you know, Bernie could offer to have hillary on his podcast to talk. Yeah. It's a good question once and she can just deny it and people say, why don't you go talk to him on his podcast? Yeah. With just the two of them in a room. No. Moderator, just the two of them in a row. Bernie and Hillary make him have a four hour conversation and just film it. Yeah. Yeah. It just said like, why, why does it any candidate just start their own podcast now it's, it's w why don't they just

Speaker 1:          01:14:11       start their own podcast now and just get out and put it out throughout their platform? I burned, you could talk to be video, it would have to be video. You'd have to see their faces because when someone gets called out on some shit, it's like they don't talk about it and then like the three minutes passes and they go, okay, next. They're like, wait, wait, wait. We're not done with this answer yet. Why is this essentially, it's ridiculous. It's a ridiculous way to get to know those people. Ridiculous way to get to know them, but it's also like that one subject is so critical and it was just glossed over. She barely responded to what? So the whole campaign thing just don't, don't respond to it then don't talk about thing. Well, I mean what did they tell her or not? Whether she chooses to or not.

Speaker 1:          01:14:48       The fact is everybody was cool with it. They just let it slide like that should be, you should be like, stop. We're not moving on. Stop the clock. We're not moving on until you answered the question. She talks about how she, like she was talking tough to those bankers. I told them to stop. What they're doing. Sure, sure, sure. Show us though. I told them that. Cut it out. Cut it out. All right mom. That's like what your mom says. You better not drink tonight. Cut it out. Ari. Young man. All right mom. All right. Cut it out and she's took 250 grand for them. Oh, they don't have enough money. Cut it out, but also waste 250 grand on a fucking speech. Siri, Google search. How to make a bomb. Hey Siri, it's so ridiculous, so ridiculous that you can get paid that much. But like, it's not like she's pink floyd fucking birthday party.

Speaker 1:          01:15:44       I knew how to hire pink floyd to play for your corporate event. You got to pay a quarter million bucks and it's going to be an awesome show. Yeah. You know they bring lasers. Who'd you see in a small show once and you see the guy who just died and a small show in Vegas once. Which guy that just stp stone temple pilots. I've talked about it a few times. It was, must have been cool. It was Dana White's birthday. They hired the stone temple pilots for Dana White's 40th birthday. Damn cool. I was like, damn, that's like long cash. As long he was going to do that. He was awesome for pitch roto hiring minuto he was going nutty backstage like backstage. She was. Who was that? Scott? What's his name? Died. Yeah. Scott. Nutty. Nutty, like crazy demands. We don't start in five minutes, we're fucking Outta here.

Speaker 1:          01:16:28       Like he's, he was a high strong dude. It wasn't an easy guy, but when he went on that fucking stage, you understood. They understood. Like maybe you have to be that crazy to be that God damn good. Because when, when they, when they started that show and when he went through that set, yeah, there's 200 people in the room and he did it like there's 50,000 people to stadium that are freaking the fuck out. He smashed it. Helios smashed to Helios. It was easy. I liked that when an artist is just fucking, yeah, I'm giving it my all. I wanted to run out of there and run back to my hotel room and right after that, yeah. You know, you see a guy like that and you'd be like, oh my God, he's just, yeah. He just was, it was flawless. Just smashed it like Damn Ronnie around on stage using that fucking megaphone.

Speaker 1:          01:17:18       Like the whole deal. That motherfucker went hard. They were good. They were really good. I was super impressed. I got the interview, I got to uh, introduce them. Really? Yeah. It was pretty dope. Like I said, happy birthday to Dana and it brought up stone temple pilots and like, this is the craziest shit ever. And he went out. He didn't know they were there. He didn't even know we were going. I didn't know I was going to be there. It was all set up. The whole Party was like, uh Oh. He didn't know that was part. Oh really? I had no idea it was gonna be what it was. He's like, Nah, that's called Joe. What's going up? Oh, what the fuck is on top of pilots? Yeah. He didn't know. We had to like hide it. He paid for it. It's like when you're a kid buys you a present.

Speaker 1:          01:17:58       Paid for it. Yeah. The UFC paid for it, you know. But um, either way it was awesome. Daddy, I bought this for you. I bought it for myself through you. You are worthy and young daughter. Yeah. You bought me something that's so sweet. That's so sweet. That guy was a bad motherfucker, but super troubled with the drugs are troubled with them. It goes back to this very like, you don't really get to that level with when it's all the same thing. You don't get a fucking, you know coke, coke, head stripper, who's going to be a good mom. You don't get somebody who's that good an artist. I'm a musician without some some run in with it. Yup. That's the weird thing about the new guy took over for a black hole sun. Who is that? Chris Cornell. Chris Cornell. Who was that Guy I took over?

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       Black Dude. Who's the new guy? Not Chris Cornell. Chris rutger. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm thinking of the wrong wrong guy down in a hole down in a hole song I was in. Chains do took over. Oh really? Yeah, because the other guy died. Right and it sounds exactly like him. Oh you can't do that. Well that was the point. It was like let's have them sing the songs in the same way and it's all fine, but this guy is like, but that's race mixing. That's gets guy, but this guy is full of life and hope and interesting. Oh, but then when he sings that song down at a hole, you're like, Oh man, you do polities I don't think you could send me all the rest of the songs.

Speaker 1:          01:19:25       You know like that guy? Yeah, I believe it or not from that new dude. That's interesting. You're happy to have the job. You ain't going to fuck this up. Probably got an Asian girlfriend, probably got an ex girlfriend. She's probably real hot. He sounds it shows hockey like him. She's probably one of them Asian girlfriends with those Mo haircuts where it's like right above her eyebrow straight across straight and then low mow haircuts didn't look bobby and have a joke like that. Chinese people say, how did they get their haircut? Kind of like mouths. I think Bobby Slayton for sure, but like that long silky black hair. He's got a girlfriend like that. You know that? Yeah. Should I, down to their ass. They show up. They're always in high heels. Like a hipster accessory. But Asian girl. Like an assassin. Yeah, super hot assassin. And some Kung Fu movie.

Speaker 1:          01:20:12       She's protecting him and she knows moves stupid hot with like a corset on. What is your assessment where a miniskirt can't be the best for mobility. Yeah. And she just has a slight Asian accent. Just light. Yeah. It's first briefly then English. But like you could hear a twinge of it and she likes chicks. I like chicks chicks over. Uh, it comes back to his dressing room. Is three other chicks in there, baby? We all have a potty. Come on baby. Oh, by the way, that's where we're going to talk about how these artists are taking off stuff off Pandora. Oh, that's what we started talking about. Spotify. Spotify. Yeah. Yeah. The, I think black keys took the stuff down. Or like you could only have her old stuff. Nothing new because they're like, you're not really paying us well enough. You only giving us access to New People.

Speaker 1:          01:20:57       So for a young comedian, people discover me from Pitt, from Pandora and spotify for sure. You know, but um, for someone who's got brings them money, then it's like at this point like you got to pay these people. And really pay everybody a fair amount. It's a great service. Having something like Pandora or spotify is great. It's awesome to be able to, you don't have to illegally download anymore. Right. You just pretty much get, but that's only on the idea that everything's going to be available. Right. Well here's the problem. Is anybody making money off of it? I'll spotify. Yeah. Do you mean does spotify making money? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:21:31       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       10 bucks a month. Subscriptions. Okay, so and they do pay some and they have to pay every artist in the world. Rugby, they don't pay that much. I don't pay very much. No. See it's different like streaming rights, it's different. It's not the same as sales. It's weird. So like you can have a company that stream stuff and like the, the rates that you get paid. There was a story about like the most played song on spotify and how much actually generated. How much would you guess? The most played song? I'm thinking like a Taylor swift kind of thing like that. Yeah. What I would to be fair, if it's that that played on that kind of,

Speaker 1:          01:22:14       we'd want to make like 1 million bucks off that write something on the alarms, right? Yeah. Or a few hundred thousand thousand 500. I mean, you would assume 5 cents a pop. That's a really valuable thing. If you're playing it millions of times. I don't know how many times you're playing it. Got Some Camper van Beethoven said that his stuff has been played way more than that. Then, uh, purchases. But then he's like, but you know, they'll come see my shows now. Right. Cracker on camera. There's definitely some benefit to it as far as exposure. It's not all negative for sure not. But does Taylor swift need that exposure? Right. So the question is what the UCB did. They're like, we're not going to pay you because you should be honored. They'll say, well, we're just barely getting by. And then they opened up two new locations after that. Yeah. Those. As soon as I found out, those guys don't pay anybody. I'm like, he can soccer. I get your fucking improv troupes. Not Pains, but these are comedians and they go, you should be lucky to perform at the UCB. It's like a showcase. I'm like, okay, maybe let's just

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       say that's true. Let's say me as a eight year comic when I was an eight year comic, like I can get seen there. Sure. But aren't you the UCB lucky to have Silverman, Sarah Sub Michelle and Zach Alfin acra show up. Like it's not just a straight, we're all lucky to be on spotify. Right, exactly. You know what I mean? They also need the black keys to be able to stay relevant. If all the top musicians, beyonce and the black keys and arcade fire, they'll go, we're all pulling out there. Sure. You know, keep it, keep it evers. Here's seven black listeners broken now. Oh, nice way to go. He goes, yeah. Then they're less of place to go for all music. No, I totally agree. So like just pay fairly

Speaker 4:          01:23:49       well. We have to find out how much money they make and what is it like, what is the the most played, the most played song ever. They just had one that got went over 500 million song, 100 million streams, what would that be? Four to $500 million. 5 cents B. I don't think you get that much. How it works out though, cause that just try to figure out the math in your head a little bit. Say there's 10 bucks a month, you have to have a payment for to take care of the service itself. Right? So they say that 30% fee goes to spotify. So there's a roughly 70% less than $7 left out of that 10 so it's a different math if you like, if you play a song one song or if I listen to only Ari Shaffir 10 times a day, 30 days a month, you would technically get all of my $7 technically.

Speaker 4:          01:24:32       But it doesn't necessarily work out that way because if I played one joe Rogan Song, he's going to get a little piece of that too. But not everyone just listens to one person. And you listened to 25 songs a day or in an end? In one hour even. Right. And a lot of time people just let it play and the they leave. So that's like one set some things up like that where they've tried to game the system where they've tried to play someone song, a new artist multiple times to try to get them some money. Oh really? It doesn't necessarily work out totally well for them that way either, but there's just not a lot of money in it in general. There's like, there's not a lot of sales for, for music and a total, like I just have a big band. I liked the def tones that they have a new album coming out soon. It just announced a concert in La. If you buy a ticket to this show, you get their album for free. Deftones um, they've been out for a long time. This show you at the outfit. That's an arcade fire did it. But like when the show is touring for the books, but I'm going to get the album anyway. I'm going to be able listen to all those songs on Youtube, on spotify, Pandora. They've been around forever. They're pretty bad ass. They had some bad ass songs.

Speaker 3:          01:25:31       Could you tell me five senses but it's not, I can't fucking figure this calculator how it works though. What he's saying. I just want to know what it would be on radio plays. I'm not mad at you. The most downloaded song,

Speaker 4:          01:25:45       well that was, that was the Ed Sheeran Song like thinking out loud I think is what it's called. 500 million in the article compared it to a youtube would. They have over 10 songs that have over a billion plays on it. How much youtube gets money because there's ads next testing. So they're getting money from the ads, not from people using the service from a subscriber and they've started

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       youtube red to try to compete with that kind of thing too, which is nine nine nine a month. James Service thing like that too. It's interesting. So there's really probably not that much money that's even left over for the artists out of that $7 kind of their argument and that people are just a lot of money in and around in general for it. All right, but don't they have like, what is it called, an IPO initial public offering that haven't they do, they do stuff like that with these kinds of companies and they sell them and then tech, uh, sector gobbles them up and the stock market, they make a of degree and already by the way. Okay, thank you. Multiple ways. That's why I'm trying to say there's deals you can have. So like a spotify or apple music could pay, uh, drake for his new album to come out exclusively on apple music.

Speaker 1:          01:26:50       And that's the best. That's the only way you can get it. That's what Kanya is sorta tried to do with title right now. Exclusively exclusivity. So it's like we have it. No one else has it. Right. And then you're like, well, if I want, this is the only way I can get this new thing. I got to get Amazon prime or I've got to get apple play or I got to get this. I don't like that because everyone has their own gaming system. It sucks when it only comes out only on xbox. Right. It's like, come on man, we're not going to fucking buy a playstation. We already have an x box. Some people that use android phones, like my friend Louis unbox therapy, he was telling me that he avoids using itunes. We're having this conversation. I was asking him about phones today cause there was a threat of my message board where people getting mad at Brian for talking shit about the Samsung Galaxy s seven and that he was going to switch over to it, but I know he switches over to different phones like every couple of months and write stories about this Guy Louis.

Speaker 1:          01:27:36       Oh, unbox therapy's a website where he said you got a youtube channel on a website, but what he does is he, he reviews tech stuff. He takes it out of the box and tries it and he talks about it and he knows a lot of shit about technology. He describes, he's thinks he's describing it from a very educated point of view and then he takes that phone. He's like, okay, I'm going to use this as my main phone for like a month or something like that. That's just like, oh fuck, I didn't realize this problem. Yeah. Tell you what's annoying, what's not. And he said he doesn't, even though he uses like Mac computers, he doesn't use itunes because itunes specific to one platform and that's annoying specific warren platform. Well, you can't get itunes like you, you like if you want to use like, you want to watch movies and shit like that.

Speaker 1:          01:28:14       I don't think you can necessarily do that on a, on an android phone. Oh yeah. A lot of people, when I tweet my podcast or she first got to tech, um, uh, they go, don't give me the itunes link. I can't use that. I'm going to android. Yeah. It's like 55% of the downloads use itunes, but 45% don't. That's a lot. Yeah. Yeah. I see the most important one. But it doesn't mean it's the only one. It's not, but it's easy to use the other 30% of your income to, so if you sell an album for 10 bucks, itunes gets $3 of that rubber that's not relevant. And podcasts, podcasts, yeah. But in like music and sales and stuff. Right. And record sales. It's a big deal. Yeah, that's a big deal. But they do provide that same sort of service, it seems like if they take 30% it's probably similar to how spotify is talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:28:58       They take, I mean they're providing a distribution labrador down there, keeping it up and it's a secure, stable platform that like the application that comes with your iphone, you're not going to get any better than that. I've had a podcast apps spotify as free for most people. Right. You just have to listen to an ad. So then they get ad revenue. Okay, go ahead David ad revenue and then you could also subscribe if you like get rid of, they get rid of the ads that we can still make money off you. We don't have to get the ads every 10 minutes. So apple does that now too. They have a streaming music site service. So what Louis was saying is he uses Amazon prime and Google play because they're not platform specific. Yeah, use tweeted a link to a new song, grimes or something. He was like, anybody who put the apple play one on the go click on it and you're like, but now I have to pay for apple play to play it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       And he was like, man, that's fucked. I know thing. Yeah. It's annoying. Like when you go to a website to read an article and they say they need your email address first. Fuck, I'm out. I'm out. But you fuck you. [inaudible] David Taylor's theory is that, that's why anyone still has hotmail. It's for, you're like, sure. Here's my email address. Go ahead and use that one. Yeah. It's just a spam filter. Yeah. Well just for like a website that you don't give a fuck about. Yeah. An email address that you just, a burner email address. Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't, I don't think the future is in, um, getting people to pay for shit. I think it's super hard to get people to pay for shipping for sure. Well, it's, it's the online, I talked to Aubrey about this a long time ago and if you're a store [inaudible], you know, and you were buying two shirts, right.

Speaker 1:          01:30:38       You know, and then you're in line right there. Like you were at starbucks yesterday and you see these, uh, these, the pad chargers, like how much did it like 10 bucks. Like, Oh, maybe I'll get one. Right. You already got your Wallet Open. And that was actually more than we were spending on coffee, but I didn't buy it. You didn't buy it, but it wouldn't be the biggest deal if you did. It was a bad example. But if you're like, hey, would you also like this? I'm socks up. Yeah, sure. I'll get some socks too. But to open up your wallet is like a way bigger deal. Even a 99 cent APP. A lot of people go like, well, let me read the reviews, you know, let me look at this as a good app. You know what I'm talking about? It's like strange though. For $1 is you're way less likely to spend it online.

Speaker 1:          01:31:15       Then 10 bucks in a store. It's just hard to get people to actually open up that eat wallet. And what, same thing with email or justice where it's like, oh, I don't want to sign up for this stuff, man. Well, a lot of times you don't have an ego wall at either. A lot of times you're just entering in all the individual credit card information every time. That's what I mean. That's what I mean. Like to open up your, to pay anything online. But you know, apple has an [inaudible] wallet. Oh, real wallet feature. Yeah. While you can actually buy things with your phone. Oh, that stuff now. And they put, they came out with, at first it was android, right? Android pay was first and then the apple player was, took over. Whatever the fuck android calls it. What do they call it? I don't know. But they've been doing that on some phones for a while. I've seen people buy shit and it's annoying as fuck be behind them because it doesn't, that doesn't eat when you're at the, uh, it's okay. When you had the, if you've ever seen that, when they do that at starbucks. Yeah. Chai scan, it fucking doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          01:32:08       Yeah. Just stop it as annoying ones in the middle of a conversation. Someone's that can get a picture and you're like, sure. And then they're like, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me find out. Oh, I got to delete some photos. Oh, it's the worst. And then align forms. We're going to say Jamie Disney armband. I haven't been at the time. And I've heard, I've heard some things about this recently. There's some sort of like wristband. You can get a wristband for your kids when you use it to pay for everything at Disney. So we don't take your wallet. All transactions. It's getting on your rides. It's your fast pass or fail. Yes. Oh Wow. The technology, and I've heard this coming. I bleed into some other places too. Whoa. He just got to set up a perfect experience for you too. Well that's one of the reasons why we're resisting this Apple Watch thing.

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       That red ban has a chimes off every hour. He couldn't figure it out when people send them text message with chime and you couldn't figure out how to shut it off, figure it out. No, that means it's hard to figure out what's bad. It's not good. Right. He's like, how's it shut off? And I'm like, I don't want my fucking, because that's where it's going to go, man. And then that thing's going to be used to buy things and then someone's going to come stand next to you and steal all your fucking credit card information off your phone. They already know how to do that. This is already a way well, won't work with Arash fear, ladies and gentlemen. You know why? Cause ours you fear has off flip phone. I told it to burb what's we're having this conversation it goes, yeah, yeah, yeah. They had cancer.

Speaker 1:          01:33:22       That dick tie it at the new ones don't give you the cancer, that deck. I don't think he's correct. I don't know. I think it's probably exactly the same amount of radiation. Well, you've shown us that was the, uh, the Disney magic band is what it's called. Oh, okay. So it's like a fitbit, so that, that kind of a thing. Yeah. But there's like, there's a lot of extra things in it. It's not just unlocked the door of your hotel room. Yup. Such your key for your car. Ooh, whoa. The thought about that though. Nobody said, well, what are some of the loses it right, but they probably don't know what your room is unless you're going to go up and down the fucking hallways every door. I went to her room, I went in there, tried the key, open it up, and then it's just some guys staring at me from in the bed.

Speaker 1:          01:34:06       They gave you the wrong thing. Oh my God. That's amazing dude. Staring and I'm like, sorry. Um Oh, it was weird. That's happened to me before. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so anyway, so they want you to put your podcast on spotify. Yeah, they have podcasts on there now and I've resisted. Hmm. I just don't know if it's a, I mean you're a precedent set or at some point, well it's, I don't know if it's necessarily beneficial. I mean, I guess more people who are able to have access to it, but I don't know. Do they edit it? Do they put ads in it? I don't know about that. They are expanding. Are there some uh, shows you can watch on there and there's this one video aspect coming through there. I liked that fact that it's available as a regular MP three and you can do whatever the fuck you want to do with it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:55       You could watch it while it's live on youtube, can watch it later or you can just download it. And if you want to download through itunes, go ahead. If you want to download it through spotify, that seems like a different thing because that's like a service that's like a new, it's a company. It's like, then you're there, you're, you're selling content. You're like a content provider, right. Spotify. And that's what they are. They're content providers, but they don't create, they're not content creators. They probably will have actually like Netflix, right? Maybe things like, well, if anyone could just get all the, the videos, then we have to do something. Netflix is constantly stepped up constantly. I mean from drop shipping. Yeah. You know, cd videos, dv, Abrahms, whatever that is. Streaming. Yeah. And then they go, ah, no, we're, we're done with that. Blockbuster. We'd put you out of business.

Speaker 1:          01:35:43       And this isn't when people are downloading stuff too much. So, uh, we'll still do that a little bit, but let's, uh, just get all, every pretty much entertainment, every documentary, every old Sitcom. Let's just get it all on our thing so you can come to us and then other people start going, well, why can't we just do that? You know, apple tv made the, made the apple TV, apple made the appletv and then fx and people like, let's pull this stuff back. Let's make it on our own APP. You can come to our APP for watch it. Yeah. So netflix sees that and like we'd have, we need a reason for you to come to us. Let's make house of cards. Let's make these interesting, cool shows with no like TV standards they have to abide by. LikeF is for family. Yeah. When you see a hard curse, a hard fuck, you buy a cartoon. Yeah. You're like, what? Yeah. It's like, oh my God. Not only that, they can do whatever nudity they want, whatever they want, any content they want, whatever they want to talk about, they can. It's up to them with the readiness and they want to put it out. They want to tell you, hey, be careful of this or they don't want to tell you. Let's see herself figured out. Kid. They don't have to. Megan Kelly, you make it tell you the Santa Claus. Santa Claus is real kids and he's white.

Speaker 1:          01:36:47       Is this 2000 and whatever? Fuck it was when this happened. 15 was that a 15 story? I think stop. We can't do this anymore by the way. I'll be in Tempe, Arizona this Thursday. Friday, Saturday. Doppler radar. I like cheese. Tempe, Arizona. The home of my first Netflix special. I recorded that there in 2005 really? Yeah man. The one where I talked about how stupid Bush was. Yeah. They keep playing that now with this election because I said you know that I think what happened like after he got elected a second time, they were probably sitting in the back of the room going we can think we go down. Oh yeah I remember that pet. Yeah I remember that bit. And then boom cause it was a really good job of like I have, I've told you this before, but using your voice the way you did that and that bit was like, it was like four years past and they all look and they go wait.

Speaker 1:          01:37:43       It's like that quiet thing, a pause mixed by quiet instead of just talking. They can flex up and down at flection. You're just really good at it. Well thank you. I just put myself in the position of that actually happening. That's what I try to like what would it be like if there really was this cabal of evil billionaires that's trying to control the mindset in program the entire country and they wanted to put a dumb person office so they could figure out how dumb people were. Like, that was the premise of the joke. Yeah. There's only one way to figure out how stupid people are. And you can watch the news, you can see what movies they buy. But the only real way is to put a dumb person in as president and see if everybody freaks out. Yeah. Because if they don't freak out, it's because they're dumber than him.

Speaker 1:          01:38:21       They don't even know he's dumb. He's like, that's a weird thing about being really fucking stupid. You don't know what to do with it. Yeah. So the only way, the premise of the bit was the only way we could really find out how stupid America was was to put a really dumb guy in as president. And there's many, many really articulate whip, smart Republican candidates that could easily make a great leader. Like, well, why would they do that? They can't find how stupid we are. If we do that, that'd be a backup plan. Let's see if we can get the dummy in first. And then after he won a second term, that's when the bit was like, I think we can go down there. So now they are, uh, they're using that to illustrate Donald Trump or something. Yeah. Band. They've made too many comparisons to presidential candidates.

Speaker 1:          01:38:59       The Hitler that it's like, guys, it does your to kicking doing it. You said Bush was Hitler. You know, that's like look enough, like the hat comedy premise from hell from hell. She's like the strip are from how, and at some point it's like, well hell doesn't seem that bad to be honest. You're overusing this. But it was a really easy way to get away with like saying something's bad. Like for a long time. Like in the 80s in particular, it was a knockout punch. Everything time. Yeah. The something from hell, I can't believe he's saying how people back then. Whoa. Slow down. Audrey, push on steroids on crack. Crack is another one. Yup. Yup. Let's say the same thing, but say it slightly different. So it seems like we're original, right? Exactly. Yeah. It's still on in one word. Well, I mean, if, if it's just a very minor part of what you're trying to describe, I guess it's fine to use it as a non creative narrative or noncreative a descriptive, but when it's, when you're doing it a lot, I think too much overuse.

Speaker 1:          01:40:08       Yeah. I wonder how much this is going to change everything the way Donald Trump is running for president. Well, here's what I saw from it. So before, I mean, I'm assuming in the Lincoln Times, you know, they were just, the candidates would just say their opinions, so what they, what they thought and that's what the newspaper print and that'd be the end of it. They would go out and talk for hours too. Yeah, sure. Stomping him, do whatever. No, no microphones. No microphones. Wow. Oh yeah. No microphones. Just get up there and talk. Hopefully the acoustics aren't terrible, but mostly it's probably outside. People Fart and take a train to the next state to try to convince them. By the time your speech has done, half the people are dead for malaria, they just die. And then it became a thing where like Bill Clinton went on Arsenio Hall and he played

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       a trumpet, trumpet, saxophone. That's what it was. And his ratings went up like 10 points over night and we're like, wait a minute, this has nothing to do with the issues. And so there was this mixture of showmanship and issues and I think trump's theory, his thesis is guys, I don't think the your platform matters as much as the showmanship. I think it's only showmanship. Well also it's who else is running. Sure. And what Ted Cruz, have you seen those videos? Ted Cruz made? Yeah, the commercials when they show the outtakes, all, all the people hugging and stuff. And the best is the wife, the, his mom going like, she prays for me and she's like, mm hmm. He goes, sometimes, you know, hours a day. She was like, oh well I don't like the look of like of hours. And she goes, where are you going with us a day?

Speaker 2:          01:41:40       Just got cut mom. Mom, stick to the script. You shape or pious and I'm not gay. Right. And the old thing is so crazy. This is like, I think Bernie's the only one talking about shit that actually American people day to day have to deal with. He's definitely talking more about social issues. Yeah. I would like to talk, I say socialism, like it's a bad word, but it's just social issues. Well, yeah, but socialism isn't just social issues. Socialism implies some sort of a community pot of money that we're going to distribute to people. Do they distributors that now and we use 80% of it for defense? Yeah. Oh well that's just all offense. But that's the problem that people find with this. The big problem that I've heard from people that actually understand it, not folks like you and me, but people that actually understand it, they're like, the problem is it just makes government bigger because what he's doing is proposing that we get more taxes from people and somehow or another it's going to create more programs and that there's more programs going to trickle down to the people.

Speaker 2:          01:42:44       It's like, but the problem is here's what I understand, but you take more taxes from people and you're just giving it to the government. And then they have to be competent. All of a sudden you're never been competent before. Right. There's a Co somebody on my message board brought this up, like the Department of fish and game that I always praise them for the conservation efforts that they've done. They've got all big wildlife biologists running it. Right. You know, like these are like actual scientists, not a writer. Ocracy they hired some really smart people care about the environment to run these fish and wildlife department. So let's say people say like that would never work and go, okay, fine. Maybe like how's it has no, but here's the, here's the reality. What we have now is not working. People are getting poorer and poorer. See, wildlife biologists are very different than economist.

Speaker 2:          01:43:27       Yeah. So when you get a wildlife biologist, it's trying to manage the buffalo population and they try to figure out, hey, you know, we've got wolves in yellowstone that are killing the buffalo. We've got to figure out how to do it. And then they try to find work arounds. They do all sorts of different things to try to maintain healthy populations. There's no profit in that. So profit. Yeah. See now the problem with anything economic is there's all sorts of motivating factors that lead up to rules that get past that allow these people that become president or become, you know, whatever the fuck they're doing, where they're making deals with people like the bankers that are paying Hillary Clinton $250,000 they get them into these positions and then they can, they can profit insanely. They get these positions on these, these guys go from, this guy was a great, it's a great documentary called inside job and it's all about the Wall Street collapse and this guy who was like this very educated financial guy is interviewing these people and picking them apart as he's interviewing them and you see, they start to panic and they start to freak out and some of them go on, you know, I'm going to only have one more question.

Speaker 2:          01:44:27       Then I'm going to leave in the beginning of the interview of they're all smiles and happy and these are economists and he finds out that these guys who were economy professors went on to get jobs with these banks. So they set these rules like, well we've chest checked with the, you know, Blah Blah Blah University economics department and they recommend this, that and that. So they get, they move into cushy jobs where they get paid millions of dollars once they leave. These government positions are these teaching positions? Very, very fascinating stuff. Cause it shows there's motivation and as soon as there's motivation for profit, everything gets girly. So Clinton can say all day and have some cash. I'm like, well I'll try to, Clinton can say all day that she has, they don't influence her. Well then they don't take on nature. Yeah. You can't take that much money to talk. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:45:16       I don't know. I do know it's like I don't, we, neither one of us really understand it, but I don't see Bernie as a guy was like, let's just do our morning. I'm sure it'll work out well. It's not about impression. It's not about, it's not bad for, they're trying to, not that I would like Mrs. Clinton, but Talos, what are those transcripts, but I think they have that work thought out. Well it's, it's tricky man. When you have a lot of money like that, hundreds of thousands of dollars and someone's paying you to talk for an hour, that is absurd. That's absurd. It doesn't make any sense. And they have transcripts of it. I guess it won't show up. She won't, she won't release them. The whole thing is very bizarre shit. Right? That's her normal thing. She hides her email. She was like, oh, I didn't know it wasn't allowed to use regular emails for this stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:46:01       Oh, you guys aren't allowed to fly that. Well, here's one of the things that I'm, Mike Baker was talking to me about and he's a former CIA operative, has been on the show before. He runs a security company now and he said, if that was me, which she did, he goes, well, I would be in jail. What if I did what she did? Private emails using a private email address and sending top secret information through that email address. He goes, I'd be in jail. He's like, she had an email server in her bathroom. Not only that, but the guy who set up that email server just got immunity from federal prosecution. Wow. So she's already in this protected group of people. They were like, we can pretty much do whatever he wants. It's squirrels, Ville, man hole things. Squirly like they're not even try. She's in the middle running for president. She at the lead of the Democratic nomination and she's involved in to criminal

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       investigations. She says Christ. Yeah. And they're just like, let's just not talk about that. Well, it's like this is all they have and when this is all they have, I mean there's no one else. Who the fuck else is there? There's Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Period. That's it. That's it on the democratic side. We haven't heard a peep of anybody else since. All right. Who else? Everybody's gone. They're all gone. It's just them. So it's, it's one of those things where everybody's shutting the fuck up because they think they have to. This is the last gasps of a dying system. This is the last gasps of a ridiculous dying system that is set up because it was back. The system is fighting back then was set up back when people wrote with feathers, slinger when we had congress, because I couldn't afford to travel from Nashville all the way up to Washington.

Speaker 1:          01:47:38       So we have our congress goes for us, they speak for us, so we have to, but man, we have email and phones. We don't need you to go there for and why do you have a job? It needs to be restructured. Restructured. Yeah. Well it needs to be restructured to that from scratch. The technology at the technology and the access to people that's available today because government should be, people should have to have some level of education to understand the parameters of what they're talking about, what they're voting on. Yeah, we don't, we're not even getting the information to it. There's so much waste. We are government has got a virus and it's not being cured. I, I talked to these guys who were defense contracts work for defense contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan and one of them had been in the military before. They both been with the military when they didn't a pinch pinto cartridge.

Speaker 1:          01:48:26       They don't order petro cartridges. They order a new printer, take out the printer cartridge and shred the new printer. What? Yeah, and there's no repercussions for that because no one has to be like, did they do that? It's a, it's easier or to order it that way. What I, there's no reason for it, man. It's all fucking wasteful. The these guys high as fuck when they're telling you this. No, they weren't like, dude, he's going to go on a podcast to talk about this too high to remember the specific details, but that's one of them and it's like, dude, we're just, it's just as bureaucracy. It's just corrupted and the governments in and now it's like, I dunno Obama, he just won't talk about, he's done some great shit, but he just won't talk about the drone strikes about wedding parties in Yemen where we're not even at war with just killing random people.

Speaker 1:          01:49:09       And our official quote is like, let's just not talk about it. But gay marriage is legalized and that's, yeah, man, that's great. You can't just murder people. More people have big died on a drone strikes under him then Bush. Yeah, way more. Well, there's more drones now. They're way better too. There's still killing innocence and we're just not talking about it. Yeah, I mean they can arrest people now. Never tried them. Well they've also, NSA has more power than they've ever had, cause Feinstein didn't just restructured it. They also used to shoot at metadata. I don't know if they still do that, but they used to shoot like we're a phone is. Oh really? So if you're a real bad guy and you're hanging out in an apartment building and your phone happens to be there, that's what you're shooting at. Oh, shooting missiles at that phone hoping somebody else has the phone, then it's like, it's acceptable casualties at the phone in the bedroom.

Speaker 1:          01:49:52       Oh, we took that bedroom out. What? That was Americans, we wouldn't do that because we value American lives. Are innocent, lives over innocent. Um, you get many lives. It will, it's just way more convenient when they don't look like us. They don't talk like us and they dress weird. It's way more convenient to light them up with rocket. This is why, uh, the British were smart when they colonized Africa. Um, they put, uh, east Indian people, Indians from, from India. They put them in charge. So the Africans hated the oppressors. Hated people who, you know, dominated him, conquered them. No one likes people. No one likes being conquered. It's just not a thing. Went to a couple of girls that ran in there, and so they're like their face of who they hate it with these Indians who also had been conquered, move over there.

Speaker 1:          01:50:33       Right? So there's really no terrorism on British soil from the African Milton's because they don't hate that white face. Well if we went to war with say Russia today, they look just like just like us. This is harder. Yeah. Luckily they were coats. Maybe we'd find out that the government's photoshopping their faces and stretching them out to make them look more like look at those oval heads. Yeah. What does that, um, which rue salon pro pro pro pro providing the cough is one of the top, uh, boxers and I think he's won 54. One 47 one, four, seven. Come on providing a coffee. He's an animal animal. Oh yeah. He's, they call him the Siberian, something around in Siberian express it overhead. Yeah. His, his is, it might seen his first name wrong. Yeah. He, um, he takes unbelievable amounts of punishment is what he looks like.

Speaker 1:          01:51:31       But look at him. See, he looks just foreign enough. You know what that is? Yeah. He's got some Asian in him. Well, he's got a Russia, I think he's got Mongolian in Mongolia. It's probably why he's such a fucking warrior. He's probably descendant of Ganga Iskcon or some shit. Yeah. He didn't look Russian. Well, the, the um, the Mongols conquered Russia for like 200 years. Really? Yeah. The Mongols came in in the winter in Russia and unexpectedly and fucking took over. He looks like toby, the front bar tender a little bit. Yeah. That's funny as fuck. That guy's an animal man. He's a fucking animal. Ooh. Yeah. He's fun to watch. He's super aggressive. So let's talk about this rematch. Which one? Nate Diaz and conor Mcgregor. What are they fighting at 55? I do not know. I don't think that's been solidified. I believe that connor is asked for it to take place at 70, which is where he was, but he can say like, I can do this exactly the same way and then it won't be a factor, you know? But also I think he was really healthy at one 70 and I think you'd like it was connor. I can think you felt great leading up to the camp and leading up to the fight. He just had a bad game plan and his ground Game Kinda got exposed to weight classes above where you want to tie two weight classes. It's not true. First of all, they both weighed in almost exactly

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       the same. No two way classes above where he won his title. Yes. But not really. All it is is they're not cutting weight. It's too, but he's not whiting. Right. But he's not fighting like Damien Maia who used to fight at two oh five or one 85 and he's cutting down title shot and listen that title shots where it's like you don't deserve title shot on two weight classes above you. It's just a nate diaz fight. Well this isn't a title shot. I'm saying at least. It's like, well, you know the whole story behind it, there was a fallout Hofeld dos Anjos is the lightweight champion was supposed to be fighting conor mcgregor. He breaks his foot 11 days before the fight. Nate Diaz takes the fight on a drop of a hat. No training whatsoever. I mean fucking none. He hasn't done anything. He was at the store.

Speaker 2:          01:53:25       Yeah, he was hanging, hanging out and uh, nate, you know, posted pictures afterwards of him drinking Tequila and hanging out in Mexico eating tacos and shit. So he was just having a car, nine bitch. He's just living his life. Right. But he's in such good shape that he can get away with that because he does so much triathlon training. He's constantly biking and swimming and running. He entered into a bunch of triathlons. He's in very good shape and so he was able to pull it off cause his cardio base was so good and just, he's a fucking damn good fighter. He's a damn good fighter. And he signed too and he's fought legitimately at one 70 twice. He lost, he lost a stun gun, Kim. And he also lost a Roy McDonald at one 70 these are the legitimate one. Seventies and Roy being one of the best ones.

Speaker 2:          01:54:08       70 world. Yeah, he got ragdolled a little bit by rory, but you know that was a wake up call for him. He went back to one 55 and at one 55 in his last fight against Michael Johnson, he put on probably the best performance up to the conor mcgregor fight, the best performance of his career. He was fucking sensations. When I view Nate Diaz, I view, I think of him as a 50 fiver. He, that's what he usually competes at. But for this fight, like he didn't want to have to cut weight 2011 days out. It's a little heavy. So he says, look, let's make it at one 70 they both agree. Nate Wade, one 69 konner weighed one 68 or maybe vice versa. I think that's it though. So I mean they're basically the same size. What will they find out? Well, they fought at one 70 what do you mean when nate said, I'll fight it once every, where was he walking up?

Speaker 2:          01:54:49       Probably a little heavier than that. He probably died it and worked out real hard for seven or eight days of the 11 cockpit on the last couple. No, connor didn't have to cut anything. I mean, if he cut anything, it probably a couple of pounds. So, which is not tied, you just don't eat. That happens. But there's not even 10 pounds different. So the same way, like when they got into the octagon, I guarantee you they're within a pound or two of each other. But nate is longer and taller and he's a very good boxer. Like nate's bars on a regular basis with Andre Ward, who was one of the best pound for pound, if not the best pound for pound box or in the world. Now that Floyd Mayweather, quote unquote retired. Andre Ward is a motherfucker and he just fought this Saturday night on hbo and I just watched it the other day.

Speaker 2:          01:55:33       Um, on Dvr. It's fucking amazing. He's so good, dude. He's such a, he's just nasty and he's now he's fighting at one 75 he's going to fight a survey. Sergey who's like the best one, 75 are in the world. So he fought nate spars with that guy that day on a regular basis, like their friends. And you know nate also spars his brother Nick, cause one of the best strikers in the UFC. Definitely one of the best boxers. You know, he's a very good boxer. And, and he also spars with Joe Schilling all the time. Who is a glory world champion kickboxing world champion. He's a motherfucker man. So Neda sparring with like high level world class striker like legitimate. Andre Ward, Joe Schilling, two world champions and two respective disciplines. So He's, he's a bad motherfucker. I just think that people, he seems swearing and stick it up his double fingers and they don't realize all that.

Speaker 2:          01:56:22       Put all that shit aside and observe his movements, observe his movements in a fight like in the Michael Johnson fight in the, uh, the gummy fight in the markets. Dave fight in the gray maynard fight. Observe his movements. He's a motherfucker dude. When he tees off on you, he comes at you like a snake. He's got long ass on connections of all time where it's like 80% of us strucks hit strikes in the first round. He Lit Donald Up. It was like, what the fuck it, nothing missed. He let Donald Up. He fucked on all up in that first round. Donald Donald Donald started coming back with leg kicks. The only guy who's ever really successfully like put him away in the UFC was Josh Thompson and Josh Thompson is one of the most underrated guys. He's, he's Josh Thompson when he was at his best left to go over to strike force. And a lot of people missed out on some of the fucking wars that he had over there.

Speaker 2:          01:57:18       And the Gilbert Melendez fights over there and he went through, you know, a lot of wear and tear on you. But like skill for skill. Josh Thompson is a mother Fucker, but he's now, he's like 36 time just starts to get everybody. But at his best. And I think that like his last fight with Nate Diaz when he head kicked, I mean stopped him. It was one of like his best performances ever. And then you had some losses after that, but it can't, it's like it's hard to stay healthy and get through a camp when you're 36 years old. When those guys get to the late thirties things start to get. So he has one loss. But the loss in my opinion, I mean one stoppage loss, but the loss to Thompson's like, well he's one of the most underrated guys. So it's like solid loss. Fuck yeah, it doesn't get, doesn't get looked at as solid as it should be.

Speaker 2:          01:57:59       I think Thompson at its best is, he's a motherfucker. So if, okay, so let's say he's a natural one 70, or let's say he wants to fight the conor, but he's not, he's not, he just wants to fight this fight at one 70 and prove his point that he would appoint to fight exactly the way they did it before and to come in and fight in a bar. This is what happens if they're going to do that in the meantime, there's lit frankie than Aldo fight for a title I long ago or vacate the belt that you haven't defended once. Max Holloway should be in the mix as well. You know, I think they also offered, although a shot at Mcgregor and he didn't take it, that could be a Brazilian thing, if you know what I mean. Who else? Okay. You made the injection like heroin, they'll do that. They still do that.

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       Uh, I would say it was more like he's just an unprepared and out of shape and they want to get knocked out again. I mean, the guy just knocked him out with want to fucking punch a couple of months ago. I remember it got, but I mean, he's like, give me that rematch because we can be mentioned. No, see, he didn't know that connor was going to get worked when Connie got worked by Nate Diaz. It changed the whole game. Is there. Oh, I can pick this guy. Everything changed, man. Everything changed in everyone's approach to him. When you watch a guy get beat up and strangled like that, you gotta pee again. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Do it. Talking about this. Don't worry about it man. But my point is for the folks listing, when you watch a guy get beat up, like conor got beat up against nate and he shoots for a take down and then gets taken down naked on top of them, beats him up and then chokes him a taps real quick.

Speaker 2:          01:59:27       Like nate just dominated. And once it got to the ground and he was already hurt when it got to the ground, then everybody goes, hmm, okay. Could Hofeld dos Anjos do this? Could. And for a guy like conor, I think one of the reasons why he wants his fight back is to prove that he fucked up, that he tried to take nate out with big power bombs. He gassed out, he got tired, and then nate boxed him up in the second round. Nate start tagging him, had him hurt and had them shoot for a take down. So a guy like conor, you don't get to be that good. You don't get to be that far. You don't get to be that successful. You don't get to knock out all though with one punch and beat the fuck out of [inaudible] in the first round, like you called it and beat the shit out of seaver and stop Chad Mendez when you wanted to bet millions of dollars on it.

Speaker 2:          02:00:10       I mean, he's a legit 100% motherfucker. But the game does not care about personalities. The game does not care about confidence. He actually doesn't, Huh? To interaction of fists and face and chokes and next and kicks and bodies. It does not care about anything other than what works. So like when you see a loss, like a Rhonda Rousey getting knocked the fuck out by Holly Holm, it does not mean that Ronda rousey sucks. It does not mean that Holly Holm is the greatest ever. It just means that the game doesn't give a fuck who you are. It doesn't care. You want to charge face first at a counter striker and she clips you with that first punch. You're already at CEC or already at check, you got rocked like the first punch and then you're getting beat up for four and a half minutes after that and then the second round comes around. You don't even know where the fuck you are. Your ears are going.

Speaker 2:          02:01:06       You can't see your fucking eyes are blurry. Must be so terrifying. That's what I love about UFC as opposed to boxing. Nobody goes 29 to no, no. I mean if you go six in a row, that's like wow. That's why John Jones, it's so spooky. Yeah. Nobody's beating Jon Jones. Jon Jones. Jon Jones has one loss and it's a disqualification. It's Matt Hamill and, and where he was caressing him on top of them. And it was a, it's a dumb rule. So like 12 to six elbows from on a clock face. If you drop an elbow down from 12 to six, the people that made the rules thought that that's somehow another, it was dangerous. It's no different than any other kind of elbows. It's just a rule. Yeah, it's stupid rule. It's a rule that they put in place because the people that were on the commission, this is coming from big John McCarthy himself.

Speaker 2:          02:01:49       The people that were on the commission at the time, they, um, they thought that if you dropped a 12 to six elbow, like those espn karate shows go, he can break bricks and shit. You could kill somebody. So they, uh, they made it illegal. Meanwhile, it's not even 12 to six. It's like one to seven. It's stupid. It's stupid. He really, I can fight again. It's really almost never 12 to six. It's always a slight angle, but either way it's fucking dumb. It's a dumb rule. It doesn't make any sense. Yeah. Um, by the way, we have nate Diaz calling indoors sports podcasts. Punchdrunk sports id really will picnic this. Oh, Nate Diaz fake. They always call. I'm glad you had to fake.

Speaker 3:          02:02:29       How good are they? The big ones. Yeah. Amazing. Really because of the accents are great and they talked about it. Two Oh nine somewhat. They're always talking about they're going pontoon boat shopping man. You come on, come on. I got to hear a man. They're great. It's Danish. No, Neil. And they're so fucking good at it. For a while they were dating Ronda Rousey and GSP was all upset about it because he wanted to date Ronda Rousey and they, they catfished him and buried him and buried him on a, uh, on a, a refrigerator box and the desert. He got out and now gsps addicted to kitty litter, tick kitty litter and computer spray. These addictions, doctor, the aliens all the time. They told me I missed the two. I'm two minutes my life. That's hilarious. Is that on youtube anywhere? Uh, no. Not Youtube but punch drunk sports.com I think we get clips. A daily motion was, I think they're all open daily motion, Dave, any of that stuff? Yeah, we got a click that shit and put it on.

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       Yeah. Why don't you have clips? I just don't like, yeah. I mean there's no, I can't give you a good reason that this is the reason why I think the rematches is huge. Okay. This is why you have to do it. Okay. First of all, because conor mcgregor up until that fight, is one of the most spectacular fighters ever attached to this boy talking about him. Yeah. Just the spectacle in that sense of spectacular. The guy gets on stage and screams at the winds and the crowd goes nuts. The Irish flags are more galvanized the nation. And I don't even know what galvanized means. It means like a coating when you get nail so they don't rust. Okay. Um, he's spectacular. Right. And his results inside the ark got other. Nate Diaz fight had been incredibly dramatic. Mid Second round, I'll cut him with an uppercut and knocking about, and then it's like, what?

Speaker 2:          02:04:08       But when a guy like nate Diaz beat you and beat you the way he beat you, the bright thing to do is to have a rematch. And this why? Because the rematch is where the big money's at. The brea match with Nate Diaz is God damn scrooge. Mcduck gigantic die. Huge. 2 million plus paper view the eyes. It's still on the table. Like if it goes, let's just say he goes to 45 then maybe 55 again, there's always going to be like, well, I mean they will beat you. You know. Exactly. Not only that, but here's the problem. What Frankie might beat him. Sure. Holloway. Max Holloway might beat him in a rematch. Who knows? Yeah. Jose Aldo might beat him now. Now the Josie especially Julie all know Josie Aldo. Yeah. It just comes and real healthy. Know what I'm saying? If he chose a, although he is a fucking nine year undefeated all time, great fighter who got clipped with one big punch.

Speaker 2:          02:05:05       So what if Aldo fights like in a similar way to how Meesha tate fought. Holly Holm takes his time. Where's that motherfucker out and like round two or three and just stays in the outside and leg kicks the shit out of him. If all though just chooses to have, I mean all it was so mad. He tried to take his head off with a left hook and he got clipped. He load it up and he got clipped. But what if he doesn't do that? What if he goes in there and play slow on the outside? Starts kicking his legs? What if he initiates a clinch? Cause let me tell you something about all those Jujitsu. It's fucking world class like you watch or Aldo versus Mike Brown in the UFC a or the WEC rather. When he wanted a welterweight, they'll featherweight title can't get anything. Right.

Speaker 2:          02:05:41       When he won the featherweight title to it, he takes his back like a fucking world champion. It's smashes him. I mean this is what Anderson did when he was at his best was he would get booze and the first and second round and he's just almost like this says, what'd you to fucking relax? I'm about to knock this guy out. Different style though. But I mean it was like, I'm not going to push. I will wait and I will get you when it's time to help continue to win. Well, Anderson has a very unique style. His style is, he's got a lot of Moyie Thai, but he also has a lot of traditional martial arts as well. Like some of the things that he does, like the front kick to the face, the way he does a front snap kick. It wasn't like a Meu type push kick or a team.

Speaker 2:          02:06:19       It was like a karate style kick was on acid for that fight. Dude at the MGM and I sit next to each other on acid screaming when he kicked him in the face. Like that dude, that was a spectacular, there was the first time we'd ever seen a front kick to the face. Kao in the UFC. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be tour. Stunning. So Anderson was a sniper and what he would do is he would find your range, find your timing, and then he would unload on shows. I can go a little close. Yeah, close look. Okay, now I'm in my ranch or you know, with different fighters who fought, fought a different style like with rich Franklin. He overwhelmed were in the clinch like rich Franklin didn't have an answer to is what's called a plum. That's when a guy grabs the back of your head like this and pinches down with his forearms.

Speaker 2:          02:07:01       And uh, the MEU Thai clinch. Like when like anything else, there's levels to it. And it's one of those things where, you know how, this is a good way to describe it. You know, you tie your shoes and you tie your shoes effortlessly, just reached down and cause you've done it your whole life. You are pathway like the neuromuscular pathway to tying your shoes is automatic. There's certain movements that become like that. Like when you're, you're sparring or you're fighting in particular, sometimes you'll move out of the way and you're throwing a counter before you even realize you're doing it. Like it's too fast for you to even think about. But you've, you've carved that path so deeply in your neuro muscular structure that when someone does this, you do that. When you see this, you counter there, you understand, you recognize openings without even being conscious of it.

Speaker 2:          02:07:45       And when, when a guy gets in those grooves, when you get in those groups, it's very hard to, to deal with it if you don't have that groove. And Anderson had that groove when it came to that Moy Thai clinch. She could see it the way he was holding onto him, pushing those fights and Chai or yeah, that's Thai kickboxing fights and it's one of the things out there punching a kicking, but they did that throw, it almost doesn't seem like it that much damage. Oh it does. It's what's humiliating. And he was more like the, the wind knocked out of you. You know, if the guy kicks your legs out from under you and slams you on your back, you're getting the wind knocked out of, you can get your, you're injured, you could get your shoulder's injured, you can get your ribs injured, your neck can get injured if you follow the wrong way or you get knocked on the way down.

Speaker 2:          02:08:28       And in some organizations you can kick them in the face. On the way down to, well, they'll flow. So they'll throw kicks and then as you are scrubbed before the referee gets to you, they'll fucking knew you in the face as you're going down, even with your gloves touching the ground, it's like legal and a lot of organizations to knee or even kick you in the face. Wow. So you got to read the funding herself. I just thought I'll just follow the way that we're going to brace myself. [inaudible] has some crazy approaches. Fun though. They're clench. Work is like one of the most underappreciated aspects of the sport because everybody thinks of it as a striking sport is, but it's also grappling sport because when they tie up inside that clinch, the guys who are really good, they, they execute these nasty trips and they also the way of manipulating you into knees and like when someone has a cold, they clamped down and they know how to control your neck.

Speaker 2:          02:09:19       It's a very confusing feeling if you're not accustomed to it from a high level practitioner because you get locked and you don't know what to do. You start grabbing at it and you're getting need and the body and then you get kneed in the chin. And you said that's one of the most brutal things whenever the whole crowd gets behind it too, and they can start growing news news as soon as that clinched comes in and they all want to see it. Well Anderson kneed him in the face. He's destroyed, were tranquil ins knows retracted, had to get his nose completely reconstructed. I mean it was, it was devastated after that. Hers. Oh Man, those were the wwe pull up rich Franklin, um, Anderson Silva versus rich Franklin once he, if you could find that anywhere that the Kao Anderson Silva Kaos Rich Franklin the first fight because it was a masterclass. No, I don't think so.

Speaker 2:          02:10:03       No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I was at his very first fight in the UFC. You might've been, it might've been. Yeah, pull it back though. So it was definitely the actual match. They'll pull it back so you can see the actual of the niece of the face before he is, get him in the clinch. And there's like scared. Yeah, well he starts doing this. He starts moving them around and manipulating, seeing, so Richard's trying to punch him, but look how he manipulates him with these fucking knees. And the clinch just, he never lets that clinch go. Boom, look at this. He just holding onto the back his neck. See I was doing with his left hand and he's needing his body and then he grabs a hold of it with two hands. Look at this. Boom. Look at that. Boom to the body so we can toss them around to the body and he's sliding around.

Speaker 2:          02:10:44       And when rich goes to punches, outmaneuvering him, he's getting his shoulders in play. So his shoulders are blocking these wide looping punches. And then he's just leaning his hips back and forcing them to like to absorb these knees to the body. And each one of them is Wiki a more and more and more. And Boom, look at these. Boom again and that balance to the chin. Boom, boom, boom, and there's a combination. He grabs him again, boom. And to the chin, boom to the legs, boom to the body and the ways moving them in a manipulating a man. This is some high level shit and you just didn't at the time see this level of more tie in a, in mma it was very rare to see, at least from this position, is a very rare position to see prolonged in an MMA fight up into this point.

Speaker 2:          02:11:29       So there is, nose is just shattered and now Anderson just moving in for the kill and he gets it again. Boom. It hits him in the temple and that's it. It's over. That's it. And his nose was destroyed. I mean destroyed. It was like on the other side of it. So you can see right there. You could see, yeah, that's when he took the title. But back it up just a little bit Jamie. You can see the nose, you can see it. What? No, a little bit more like right there. Let it go right there. Why Watch when he look at his nose, it's cave at the top. There's no bridge. The bridge, no, it's completely smashed. Ah, as knows was never the same again. He had to get a nasal reconstruction surgery and it was a big deal and they, they, you have to, you know, put splints on your fucking back up.

Speaker 2:          02:12:11       They came back or fought him again. Fought Anderson again, got beat up again. Just [inaudible]. He did his best. He fought well and he fought, fought great fighters. I mean rich Franklin had some great wars. Vandelay Silva in the UFC knocked out chocolate down as low as five. Oh, chuck was later. Chuck was his last fight. The last fight in the UFC. They have a broken arm. He knocked out chuck. Yup. Or fuck it. I got one shot go for chuck broke his left arm with the kick. Chuck kick. Fucking aw, hard. That's some good fights in that. Oh my God. But that was like the first time we'd seen that level of that clinch in a world championship level fight. You never seen anybody control someone for that long with a Thai clinch. It was like Wah. So Anderson was like responsible for a lot of innovation.

Speaker 2:          02:12:52       A lot of firsts and not necessarily innovation in that he's using like pretty standard traditional techniques for that respective art form. Like a front kick is the most standard technique ever. But oddly enough, there was no front kick Kaos until he knocked out vitor Belfort. It's amazing when you see that and then it opens up. Skateboarding has that too where it's like someone will do it. Everybody goes, oh, let's all do that. Yeah. When Leonardo knocked out, uh, randy coture with a jumping front kick to the face, everybody was like, oh, in Toronto and from like 60,000 people. That's a big one. Yeah. When are they going to do the garden? I don't know where they can do it now. It's just recently got past, but just to finish up this Frankie Edgar thing, Frankie Edgar could beat him if, if he can get taken down and dominant like that with nate.

Speaker 2:          02:13:40       Frankie's a goddamn tornado. Frankie. I agree. I do too. For getting left out there. Like there's a, there's a title eliminator fight and now it's been like, I guess not a year, but like, well where this title shot? He did what he had to say. You said when this and you got a title shot financially though, you got it. You got to understand their point of view. Okay. But in the meantime, although edgar interim title, yeah. Or Max Holloway. Max Holloway's in the mix as well. I can sue the jump. Edgar. It could wah, it would be either hot ball. You know what I say? You got to get all doorframe actually you've got to give all the pretty much nine straight years, no losses. You got to let them fight again. Right. Of course. That's not a rematch. Nofziger I'm saying like title who is either against a connor or whoever.

Speaker 2:          02:14:21       Okay. Yeah, I agree. Like he's a number one contender. That's a good call. Or You could set up a fight. We're frankie fights Max Holloway or the other eliminator. Yeah. The problem with Dafydd is then you get rid of like one of the contenders. Yeah. If, if it actually comes to pass, I feel like he's already done that title eliminator thing he wanted, he did what he's asked to that half Max Holloway fight the winner of Aldo. Um, Frankie, the real problem is a financial problem because the money with Nate Diaz is going to be so God damn gigantic. But in the meantime also had that fight. But the problem is one of those guys keep, get lost and get beat up. It's, it's true. It's, did you have three pieces in play at one 45? I agree with you, but I'm saying like the real, the smart move really is you tell connor he has to pick a weight class and if you want to fight at one 70, you got to give up your 145 pound title and they fight for the real title, not for the interim title.

Speaker 2:          02:15:16       That's, that's the real thing. Like just give up your title, give it up. John Jones had to give up his title because illegal problems, right? Yeah. So something, I had to give it up because uh, er Aldo had to give it up because he couldn't fight for awhile. What? Well, no, he never did get it and give up a steady, they, in terms of being trump, fuck the interim. Just give up your title. You know, it doesn't matter. It's not a loss. The loss to nate Diaz, you want to go to one 70 that means you campaigning there. You can't just freeze up the division. So then you have Aldo versus frankie for the real fucking title. And they fought already before, by the way. Although frankly, yes and although beat Frankie and was doing Aldo in his prime, but I think that Frankie is better right now than he was then.

Speaker 2:          02:15:54       And I think that he's got some key wins. Fights. He's not supposed to win. That's all he keeps doing and doing it do. It just keeps winning fights. He's not supposed to win. Well, he wins fights. He's supposed to win too. Oh yeah, you're right. Faber fight. I mean Frankie still start, he makes his name on these fucking Bj fights and at these all these fights, it just like, Nah, I didn't have a chance. And they just keep doing it. The Cub Swanson fight was a overwhelming fight and then the Chad Mendez knock out, he knocked out Chad Mendez with one punch. He's at the top of the heap in my opinion. So I think that a rematch was not, it's not a bad idea between frankie and Aldo for the title and you have that on an undercard of a UFC 200 or whatever the fuck you've been hotter, want someday to come back to 45 and it's like sure man will give you a title fight right away.

Speaker 2:          02:16:36       It's not like connor is not going to know that. He already beat Aldo and knocked him out with one punch. He could talk all kinds of mad shit for the rematch. They could do it, run it all back again. If all though can get past frankie. Yeah. So it's just a lot of fun stuff that can happen. But the nate diaz fight has to take place because here's my point was this is my final point, is that if he beats nate diaz, he silences everybody. If he goes out there and he fights smart and he sniped him and he stays the fuck away from the boxing, he uses a lot of leg kicks. The Way dos Anjos did takes the front, cause nate stands real heavy on the front leg. His front leg will be his right leg and connor is a southpaw. So set connor will be throwing a hard left leg kick from the back leg.

Speaker 2:          02:17:15       It's a good setup for him in that regard. And then I'll also, connor knows now he can't knock me out with one punch. So when we go, so he's not going to load up and try to uncork. He's going to try to fight smart. So in fighting smart, then he'll be able to incorporate leg kicks and he'll be able to incorporate, uh, he'll also understand he's got to fucking stay off the ground. You, you, you're, you're not going to do well on the ground one. Nate Diaz, he's just, he's at a very, very high level on the ground. So unless connor gets way better with his Jujitsu, yeah. By the time that fight takes place, it's just keep the fight standing up. Use a lot of leg kicks, you any beats them. And if you beat some, if he beats him, if he beats nate, Diaz loses.

Speaker 2:          02:17:52       Yeah. So if he loses, he was gonna lose. He might've lost a frankie. I'm going to say he's going to, but he could have lost all, do a rematch, anything could have happened. And then that Nate Diaz money's gone. See the Nate Diaz, money's the big money. He is the most famous guy along with connor right now. If he wins, they're doing a 100% and they're all, and then they give up that fucking title at one 45 and get fucking rich. I mean, at some level, if you're, if you're, uh, if you're a martial artist and emphasize the artists, give, keep your fucking titles the way Chris serone seems to think about it. Well, I'm just here to fight, man. You play whatever belt you want on me. He certainly want that title. So yeah, I feel what you're saying. Yeah. Um, I think it's about money. Weights, you know, I'm money fights are what's really important and it's not a matter of titles.

Speaker 2:          02:18:39       No one want to give a fuck if neither nate Diaz doesn't have a title. And conor mcgregor is not the welterweight champion. If he gave up his title, that wouldn't mean a goddamn thing. The war. So great. Former featherweight champion versus former ultimate fighter winner who stopped this guy in a second round of their last fight. It's a spectacular fight and the trash is so good. Oh, it's a giant fight. Steroids. How you take that back? All right. Steroids. Yeah, it's a giant. What have I ever done? I've never done it. Steroids. Yeah, so correct. Nate and nate was an flap ton flappable, but all of that last fight, they were like, you got to stop talking to the Reps. Dot. He's like, why? That's how I fight whatever fight in stockton. I fight. You can't tell him to talk shit. What do you mean is that a rental referee needs to shut the fuck up.

Speaker 2:          02:19:24       It's not a rule. You can't do that. There's a lot stuff that referees, referee's get a little busy in there. Sometimes they they, they interfere too much. They talk too much fight. Come on guys. Fight. Keep it moving. Like when they are fighting. Sometimes I say that like when guys are clenching and they have a turncoat what? Yeah, there's some referees. They're just not that good. Oh, right. You know, there's like, there's guys that say it when it's appropriate, like herb dean will say it when it's appropriate. Like if someone's like, they're stalling, he's great. He's a gold standard. Him and mccarthy are the gold standard to the best. And uh, Josh Rosenfeld,

Speaker 3:          02:19:55       I would tell you this, I saw once at the Pearl, I saw, um, her being called a fight and, uh, people were booing early stoppage, early stoppage, and I saw him walk out of the optic octagon optic on it. I saw him walking out of the octagon and look at the replay and watch it. I saw him watch it and then he sees the replay go. Yeah. Like he was like, I did the right thing.

Speaker 2:          02:20:17       Yeah. He, um, he and I had a conversation after the Tim Silvia fight. Yeah. Tim Silvia fought Frank Mir and the audience is booing cause he stopped the fight because they didn't see it. But I saw it because I had the replay in front of me and the spleen, the audience didn't have a screen that they could call it from the truck instantly. So they had to pull it up on the big screen where you could see frank's arm break. Uh, so, or excuse me, he see Tim's on break. Yeah. So frank got him in an arm bar and snapped his forum in half, and herb was right there and called it, and the referee, the audience was screaming Booboo, booboo. But when I got in there, I go, well, what's going on? I go, it looks like it was broken. He goes, oh yeah, I heard it.

Speaker 2:          02:20:59       It snapped. And so then we played it back to the audience and I said, well, watch this. What's that? What's that? I go, that's a broken arm. And then it showed it to, uh, Tim Silvia and Tim Sylvia, thank [inaudible] herb dean after the fight. He's like, I was complaining about the early stoppage, but you saved my career. Like my fucking arm is broken in half. And so herb was like, here are, you heard the snap saw the bone a lot more damage than fucking with it or her was in the perfect position. He's a really good referees as far as holiday. I said, thank yeah, thank you for saving my career. And finally his fucking arm man, because if someone yanks on a compound fracture and it goes right through the skin and the bone birth, he use all sorts of risk of infection. The real serious complications. I mean, who knows if that arms ever going to be the same again,

Speaker 3:          02:21:39       most exciting fight I might've ever seen Tim Silvia Radica tour in Columbus. [inaudible] verify first five they ever had in Columbus, right? Not passed on the first round. And then everyone was like, what? Yeah, no, he can't take the title. Yeah, that's all right. One one round. That's good. That's good. And then went on the second round, I was like, dude, if he wins one more round, he'll win the decision. Were any big brother to him? Beat him five. Oh.

Speaker 2:          02:22:02       And he, he, he stepped in with like the inside leg kick fake to the big right hand and just collaborate. Tim Silvia. And I think tim just totally never recovered from that and it was probably just caught him on the Chin and whopped him. Did you ever see Tim Sylvia when he fought Ray Mercer? Yeah. Dude, that was a crazy idea.

Speaker 3:          02:22:21       That was a crazy still fake. The leg kick timmers like we're not going to do it kicks right. We're under the pussy. Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       Fake the leg kick. This is what was supposed to happen. They were supposed to have a boxing match. It's supposed to be Raymar surface tim silver with a boxing match. But because Ray Mercer, um, was a world champion and Tim Silvia didn't have any pro boxing matches, the section isn't sanctioned. So they had to make it mma, which they say, hey, we both know we're just going to do boxing. And they'll be like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Allegedly. They agreed to that. And then Tim Silvia leg kicked him and Ray Mercer hit him with a haymaker from hell. It was a haymaker on steroids. It was a knockout on crack. Yeah. Ray Marcia was a monster when he was young. He could hit a hard, that's like the last thing that goes away with a guy like him. Here it is like, see, he gets kicked and he's like, Oh fuck you mother fucker.

Speaker 1:          02:23:10       I think we talked about this. And then he fucking big boy too. Boom. Look at that. What does the six eight, six, 10 yeah. Oh, he's enormous. Yeah. Oh, he got slept. Look, watch this. Punch womp. That guy hits so hard for him to catch you like that on the chin. Well, mercer, he was awesome back in the day. Ray Mercer was awesome. Knock out a Tommy Morrison. Did you ever see that? No. Tommy Gun, God, one of the most frightening knockouts in the history of boxing through. Sure. Tommy Morrison was the guy. He was the white hope. Everybody thought he was going to be the heavyweight champion. He was in the rocky movie. He was this bad ass and he fought motherfucking Ray Mercer and Ray Mercer. Boom. He catches him with this shot and look at this fucking combination. Boom, boom, boom. And Tommy gets caught up in the ropes here going down.

Speaker 1:          02:24:03       Look, his arm gets wrapped up in the ropes and look at this. Boom, boom. He's out. Boom, standing up. The reps try to stop and he's caught. He was caught in the road. Should have been down, dude. It was brutal. It was brutal. It's one of the worst Kaos ever and Morrison came back from that, but not really. That's amazing. He was always fucked up from that. That fight was just devastating. He got tired. He the anxiety of the event and the fact that ray mercer hit so hard, you know, you're always nervous. You always scared and then he got caught. Bang started slowing down and got caught. Ray Mercer could close the fucking show too. Speaking of fights, speaking of fights, Greg Fitzsimmons is going to doing a fight story in the next, next season of this is not happening. Oh, are you a plugging, plugging? I didn't realize I was doing it, but it is every Tuesday night you got just three episodes left. Didn't you just say you're going to be some more soon doing standup comedy perhaps this weekend by the thought about Tempe, Arizona at the Improv at Tempe Improv. What I place the great.com you go to our website one oh five the zoo. If you enter in your email address, you can win tickets to see Irish. A fair. Alright. Most likely we'll just said no. Yo, this is for sure you guys. You can dvr the show for sure. I'd like you to do that. Rod Whites on this week with me during that story about Chinese

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       shit squat toilet. Oh Nice. Yeah. I worked it into like a long nice story bias. If you google or youtube search, this is not happening. Playlist. You'll see the unedited versions of these long form stories. 71 videos up right now. Diaz has probably four of them. That's beautiful. Rogan has to us all out, man at the Improv lab and side, bro. 12 people. Bella. Donna was one of them. Bella, Donna. She wasn't the audience. Whatever happened to her. She looked tired. She got out of the business. I don't really come across porn hub anymore. They just get out of the businessman. But yeah. But yeah, I started with nothing Diaz and Marin was in the first one. Did you start from the bottom? Now you're here. I guess so. I guess now the whole crew's here. That's might be true. I think that really holds true.

Speaker 2:          02:26:08       I mean, it's an arguable this point, dawn and from the bottom. Now we're here. This is not in three weeks in the season finale. So a cyborgs in the UFC now too. That's amazing. I just heard that from you. We're open pool. Yeah. Finally, finally. Yeah. At one 41 40 fights it. 35 yes. And she's going to fight Leslie Smith who fights at one 35 she's the girl at her ear exploded or here got torn off by Jessica. I, what's the problem? Well, it's not a problem, but it's a one 40 pound weight class instead of a one 45 that's the one 45 is what she's champion of and Invicta. And I think the idea is that they worried that they don't have enough 145 pound talent. I think they didn't have enough hunted know for sure they didn't have 115 pound town. Some of the third about to give somebody a third rematch in five years.

Speaker 2:          02:27:03       Like, come on man, what you mean we should tape? It was like you don't have a deep enough weight class if that's what you keep doing. Well sort of, but I mean that's the same problem they're going to have right now at welterweight. The same problem you were talking about at one 45, which has a lot of talent. There's a lot of town at one 45 and men's. Oh yeah. You know, so this is what I think. I think, uh, first of all she's fucking terrifying to talk about like one of the scariest female strikers in mma, cyborgs terrifying. And Tony and I got in trouble because we, uh, said some inappropriate jokes about what would a roast be like with her. All jokes aside. Even before that I had tweeted that a, I would love to see her in the UFC for sure. The name, she's a monster. And I think also we shouldn't have double standards as far as who takes performance enhancing drugs, whether it's for men or for women. Like it was like things are kind of is, I think the way people look at it, like what a woman is taking testosterone versus a man taking testosterone.

Speaker 2:          02:28:01       Yeah. But you know, honestly, like some of the things that men have been caught with have been pretty unnatural as well. Like super human levels of testosterone that don't even exist in medical books, you know? So it's, you could argue that it's dangerous because a woman does change her anatomy, whatever. They're testing her now. Yeah, but your anatomy changes. Oh, right. But you have to make a weight class. It's, it's tricky, man. I mean it always seen before this holly Holm things happened and that's all fishy too. What's fishy? Rhonda won't take a fight. I'll take a fight against Holly Holm and then it's suddenly like Misha tate when it's like, I'm ready to fight now. It's like, oh no. She's not necessarily ready to fight now. No, she, she's not. She can't find until like November. She was really, she has, she's got movie obligations. They got moved around.

Speaker 2:          02:28:43       See that's bad right there. When the movies get in the way of your fights, like you got to pick one or the other. Go in between. Yeah. I, as soon as my fights over, I can do your movie for the next three months and then I got her back to training. It's gotta be hard though when you're a, you know, a super celebrity and you're getting all this love and everybody wants to put you in all these different things. It's gotta be hard to say no to certain things obviously. But the same shit happens. A female comics. Yeah, but it's way worse with a fighter because a fighter has to be physically tuned up to go in to do battle and get kicked in the fucking way. We're sort of fighter. It's just similar where it's like you're not concentrating on the thing that got you there.

Speaker 2:          02:29:18       So the thing that got you there is now suffering. Maybe you don't care anymore. Maybe you just want to do movies. Okay, well that happens to a lot of comics when they, they make it, all the sudden you start getting movie offers and TV show offers up. Sucks. Yeah. You're um, you got to spend time in the trenches. I'll work out for two weeks before my special. I was like, oh no, you can't do that. I had a conversation with a guy was on a TV show about that. It was telling me he was doing a special, I'm like, what? When are you doing? He's like, Saturday night, I'm going to, I knew he had been doing like one or two sets a week. It's like, whoa. Hmm. All right. Yeah. Like what are you doing? She wants Julian one or two headlines that's a week.

Speaker 2:          02:29:52       It's not like he's doing one or two theaters a week just doing spots. It's crazy. That's a lack of respect for the art form. Well, it's not no herself. Not Knowing, not having done it, you know, not, not often done it the right way where you feel better and everything's loose. You know, you think I'm doing well, my sets are going well. We've all made the stringing together an hour, four minutes. Yeah. I mean you can, it's just to do it the right way, like the way, um, I think gives it the most time to grow. You have to have material that you've worked on for a long time and you have to put a lot of effort into it and then you have to tighten that shit down and get a really great comedy shape for about two months. That's what I think. I think you need two solid months of every weekend.

Speaker 2:          02:30:37       Smashing it every weekend. Two shows, Friday, two shows, Saturday show on Sunday. Do spouts during the week. And you know what dude? We feel asked me what's the best show to watch. And I was like, I don't know. They're all the same. But if it's my first time on the road, even in two weeks, that the Thursday show, that first show of the week is not going to be the best show. It depends though. It depends. Sure I could get loose and have fun doing during the week and how excited you are to be in San Francisco and if I just performed a Thursday through Sunday, the week before, so this is the only three days later. Right. Y'All can be sharp. But if it's been a few weeks and it's like, but by Saturday of that week, oh I'm on fire. And there's a big difference between doing Thursday night. If you are coming off of a weekend run of like three, five weekends in a row and you're on fire like one of a whenever.

Speaker 2:          02:31:24       One of the times, the only time I've ever gone on a real tour was when I did that thing with Charlie Murphy and half Ron and we did that real men of comedy maximum thing that that thing, man, we did 22 or 23 dates and you're just doing show after show after show after show. Oh, you get like a, like a fucking Samurai sword, man. The blade just gets folded down and polished. And now imagine if you took off half those days to go shoot a movie, how would your final shows up on most of those days? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's no way, but it's like everything else. Everything else. I mean, you don't become a world champion fighter without dedicating your life to it. You don't become a great musician without a lot of rehearsal and a lot of planning. How much you're going to prep before your, uh, how many weeks in a row before your next special you're gonna go, what are you going to do?

Speaker 2:          02:32:08       No less than no less than eight weeks. Well, first of all, never t I'm not, I've taken like vacations or it took a vacation last week, which I wrote when I was on vacation. Sometimes I think those vacation plans, yeah, but sometimes I think those vacation times where I know I'm not going to perform it, I just write my thoughts down with no pressure just to fuck around. And I get ideas. I get little seeds that grow from those sort of, you know, those, those introspective sit down moments on the beach be presented right now. So you have to tap this, that doesn't have to be presented to an audience right now. So you have two or three days to form your thoughts fully and really go into it five days a week, whatever it is. My point being, um, I'm constantly working, like I'm not taking any time off besides like having a little vacation time.

Speaker 2:          02:32:53       Even when I had a vacation, I came back and I did, I gave back on my vacation on Thursday night and I was performing Friday and Saturday night and went right back in, you know, and I'm doing two, three shows a night. I'm doing them a different clubs and moving around and then I'm gonna run the road. I think you, you've got to stay sharp. You gotta, you gotta bear down. But the last run I accept no less than two months, but every week. Yeah. And on the road every week somewhere. It doesn't have to be on the road. It can be the Irvine Improv. It could be Ontario do an hours. Yes. So you're saying seven straight weeks and then fill them on the eighth. Yeah. And you're not going to take I sometimes I thought, I don't know if I should like take the week off before. So then when Thursday comes wherever I'm doing a cap city in October.

Speaker 2:          02:33:36       But like when I, when I do have a little freshness to it, you could do that. I don't know the right way. And I also want to do like a garbage club the week before that c level room where I won't have fans and I can just like, let me test, let me failure where you go as long as you put it online and dealer fans, daisy just lower percentage, just like I don't have a drug as people, you know, he felt for Ted Cruz, you know those people, they're not on the coast. Um, I don't know man. I think it's different for everybody. So you're going to do eight straight weeks. That's great. You're going to be, so you're going to be fire. I think you have to, I think you could also like, um, during the weekdays I got to do like ice house sets and or Tuesday night. No, but like do not just store sets but do long sets during the week too. He's got to hammer it down man. And you, you'll know, you'll know if you're burning, you know, if you're not feeling that good about it and you'll know if it's, it's, you know, you're feeling good. But I think, um,

Speaker 2:          02:34:36       I dunno man. It's exciting stuff. Yeah, you're a

Speaker 2:          02:34:42       correct whatever. Fucking just the fire math or fire. I'm into it right now. Really into it. Loving it, man. And other thing is coming back to the store, which has been a little over a year now. You know, I feel it though. Fuck. Love it. Very happy. Perfect move. It feels like it's being away from. It was great. It's your home. You were at war for a while or something that you got back home and everything's normal again. That's better. It's better than young crop is better. E Bay has completely changed, changed the game, reached out to people like foot. And Hannibal and just be like, hey, whatever the system was, here's the number to call and call and every Monday we were one of the best comics in the country. Just come, come on. Adam came to get me. Well I came by it. Why me? I came, I wanted to go by there again for two reasons. One, because you were doing your special there. I knew it had to be there, so I was like, okay, thank you. That meant a lot to me. Yeah, I had to, I was like, I'm not going to like that. It was a huge deal. Like you getting your first comedy central special and you know me being your friend from when you were a doorman. Yeah. Yeah. Door Guy, dude. You know you have a comedy central special and it's filming at the store.

Speaker 2:          02:35:53       You know, I was going pretty excited so I decided to go the day before for that so I came down on, it wouldn't be like during the special like Oh my God, I chose to get a lot of the work I had to go like just relax. The fact that I was there. So I went to roast battle and I was like, wow, the vibe of this place is crazy. I was like, this is so much better than it was before. It just, it's, the young crop is so much better. That roast battles insane. They've empowered. Emily has empowered like the door guides, buck. If you can come up with a show and you can get some people there, I'll give you the belly room. Yup. Just come up with a show. I'm looking for you guys to like make instead of before. We're like Mitzi, he'll never let us do anything.

Speaker 2:          02:36:32       Yeah, no, it's a totally different animal. It's just way better. And it's also, we've been talking about this, that there's people now that became comedy fans because of the Internet from Youtube clips and from podcasts, and they understand it now and they know that that's the place where we fuck around and work out and they know that we're going to be there all the time. You'd be audience members. Yeah. So you build it and they'll come like, you go there now it's fucking mob mob. Wednesday. It's mom's on a Tuesday, Monday, the open mic show, the employee show, they're like, it's packed there. Cause one of the only times you can get a free show at the comedy store too, they sold out 20 nights in the or in a row and the or. Okay. And people understand what this means since it's only, maybe it's not, it's 165 seats. But when I ran

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       the cover booth, there were Tuesdays and Wednesdays consistently. You couldn't start with less than six people. And we wouldn't start shows was start nine. We wouldn't start till like 10 cause we put and get six people in there. Yeah, it'd be nobody there six now. And now it's just

Speaker 2:          02:37:31       knowing that those times were only, I mean less than a decade ago was like, wow, the internet changed. The game. Son Changed the whole game and podcasts changed the game. Everybody's got a Goddamn podcast that you're gonna get some fans pills or mark Marin. I mean, Mark Marin's entire fame is based on a podcast. He didn't get fame from anything. I mean a little bit from that, uh, America show. But that was all kind of gone. Yeah, he had a small base, but that's very, that's how he's got now. Yeah. No, I mean now he's famous in America. He's famous and he's famous because of the Internet, because of podcasting. Al madrigals there. You know what I mean? It's like

Speaker 1:          02:38:09       here's what's an amazing thing. It overthrew a fucking government in Libya and an and an Egypt. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:38:16       yeah. The Internet is a motherfucker, dude. It's a motherfucker and so the place is what it should have always been. It's the like the best like playground for comics, whatever you want, fuck around, come up with great material and men, Oh my God folks, if you're in town on a night where Brian Holtzman is closing out the main room, just go. I mean this is not, it's not become a thing yet. It should be a thing like when people are talking about like Kennison his prime. I came in late. Yeah, it was all late night. I'm telling you, Bryan Holtzman on Friday night, he got on stage at like, you know like 12 o'clock 1230 or something like that. Three and a half hours into the show. It's a long show. If that's the main road that there were 300 people in there, there's probably 30 at this point. Well, there's more and more now. That's what's interesting. There was like 60 or 70 so that people know that it's happening now because then as the show goes off forever. So if you just, if you finish your bar at fucking 1130, you can just roll in. I'm telling you, he got a second half of it. He's a fucking animal. He is so funny. And Brian is a guy that was there when I first arrived in [inaudible] 94

Speaker 1:          02:39:26       it'll help Mitzi found him. She was in her office upstairs. Remember that old office up there and uh, there's a door you can still see. It's kind of sealed up into the belly room from her office. She heard somebody killing and she was like, well, what is this? She just kind of listened through the door and she opened it up and it was Holtzman offstage. Wow. Get him over here. Wow. Yeah. And like a bringer show type thing, like a, you know, an open mic type thing. Just one of my favorite comedians. He's mean, he almost made me Barf once. Like I was laughing so hard, I couldn't even control it. I want to do any of this. He was

Speaker 2:          02:39:59       material, but [inaudible] has been about, uh, Hillary Clinton. Yeah. You can't use it. Literally. So singular and anger he brings to it and, and the, I mean, when Charlie's angels came out, they used to, uh, uh, uh,

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       uh, ashtrays at the comedy store. Big fucking thick glass ones. I mean thick and big. I mean the size of this alarm clock. I remember those things. Eventually I got the plastic ones, but they had them up there. It's only for the comedians to smoke. Right. If they want it to. Cause if you did and he goes, he's childish. I don't like that movie because it gets women the false impression that they can defend themselves. I am a 220 pound former crack addict, former marine. I will. And it takes the fucking ashtray. Oh, he just slams it. I will close it. And it just shatters. He destroyed a giant glass ashtray onstage and it's, you would say, that's not funny. That's scary. He's talking about beating women that you have to see it. It's a character, but in, he'll break character occasionally and giggle and laugh, and then he goes back into it.

Speaker 3:          02:40:57       Fuck Dude. The lack of, put your heads down if you don't want to live in the jungle, but your eyes, he almost, he would do sometimes bad jokes, like real stock jokes so he could get mad at the crap for not laughing at them. Knocks doctors, just his own stock jokes. Right. So He'd get mad at the craft or not the jump. So we can go off. Yeah. Well, he just wants to be angry, but it's fucking great. Anyway. Yeah. Comedy store. It's awesome. That's it folks. We've got to bring this pitch home. I gotta go work for the UFC. I got some counties do. I'm going to find out some secrets you find out about some fights, some shit nobody knows about.
