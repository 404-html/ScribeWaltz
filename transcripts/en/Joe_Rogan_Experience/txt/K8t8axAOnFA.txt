Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. One of the main things, I think that my advice would be, it's a lot easier to focus on what you should eat then on what you shouldn't. And I think that an more inclusionary diet is, is key. So focusing on what your body needs, you know, not only for short term but what it needs for long term focus on that more than yeah, because, because it's just, first of all, if you focus on what you're limiting from your diet, then you're not going to be getting all the good stuff that you need. That's part of the talking a lot about loss. You're also thinking, it's just like, it's so there's too many little, it's easy to become caught up in a lot of minutia. Um, and I know this because I've been there. Uh, and so, you know, getting caught up in all this little minutia, you know, it can take you forever to try to figure out what's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:54          And then in the meantime you're getting distracted from the important thing is not as what you need. You know, your body, your body is very resilient. And if you feed it what it needs, you can fight off stuff. You're going to, you're going to age better. You know, all these little chemical reactions and enzymatic reactions going on in all your cells, in your liver and your kidney and your brain. All these things are going to keep happening because you're feeding it. And when you have a little bit of toxic stuff, guess what? All of these pathways are ready because they're so, they're getting nourished, are getting what they need that they activate in the, your body has protective mechanisms to make sure it doesn't get cancered. You know, I explained that when you make reactive oxygen species, you can repair it or you can do the cell will die.

Speaker 1:          01:32          But all those, all those repair a stress response mechanisms, they require that, you know, you're, you're giving yourselves what they need to do that. So if you're so focused on what not to eat, that you're not getting enough of what you need, then your body is, you know, capacity to do that isn't going to be as optimal. So I really like, I really think it's easier, especially for people that don't have a scientific background that don't have time. I mean because it takes a lot of time to sit there and read through all the scientific ses and figuring out what's going on, all the complex interactions, you know, I barely have time to do that and it's like I do this every day. Like I do research every day and on top of that, in my spare time I do and it's still overwhelming and I still can only get so much done.

Speaker 2:          02:16          Didn't you have like plans on being some sort of a marine biologist or something? At some point? I tell people that story because this is funny. On twitter I found this rock, my daughter found this rock on the beach in Santa Barbara and had all these holes in it and we're trying to figure out what the fuck it was was an asteroid or something. I put on twitter, I go, what's this rock Joe fucking Perry is the first guy to answer me on twitter and tells me it's a see stone. Like these animals had like burrowed into this stone and created a little homes really well told me. Well anyway, listen, I love the ocean and it captured me from the very beginning. I mean, I love, I love

Speaker 1:          03:00          Jacques Cousteau and watching those, those specials and I got to see, seems speak a couple of times in Boston and I just was, uh, that's what I wanted to be. I want it to be. I W I went to woods hole and you know, visited there and, and uh, uh, and I, and I thought that's what I wanted to do was be a marine biologist and uh, you know, and the whole learning disability thing, um, which they didn't know what to call it back then except the discipline thing, you know what I mean? I wasn't studying hard enough. Well, I wanted to, wanted to get good grades. They studied as hard as I could. I mean, it looked at the page, read it, nothing's stuck. And this lexicon couldn't get grades. Now it's like a Adhd, I guess they call it down. And, uh, and that's where, uh, they have different ways to teach kids now and it doesn't involve, you know, like taking some pills.

Speaker 1:          03:55          I mean there's just different ways of teaching that, that work and they just didn't have it back then. What would you say to one though? Like say if someone came along like some 15 year old kid says, Hey, I'm a huge UFC fan. I want to fight in MMA. Uh, how should I get started? I would have him pick one discipline to start. If you're 15 years old, go wrestle. If he, if you are more drawn to boxing or kickboxing and then go do that along the way. Play and experiment a little bit. But athlete development is changing now. There's this, this trend for when kids are as young as five, six years old that there's these an intensive training program. She had larger cities where there's good resource, good coaching and good facilities. They take these kids from an early age, maybe they train them football or basketball or hockey, something like this with the intent of development professional athletes.

Speaker 1:          04:42          This approaches almost producing zero professional athletes. The ones who are successful are the ones who played three or four sports growing up and then they get to a certain age and then they start narrowing in and kind of defining the best way to be. What are they going to do? The Australians did it before the Olympics in 2000 they started to take it a whole bunch of metrics on their athletes finding, okay, you're not good enough to win a metal here. Have you thought about this, try this. And as a result, the Ozzies, they've won national governing body for um, for their Olympic sports development as their assault. They did 10 times per capita. The man of metals at the u s did in 2012, um, in, in the UK they did the same thing. They took it a little bit further as example of one woman who was good, I think she was some type of distance runner or something.

Speaker 1:          05:29          They'd all sorts of measurements like the, the wrist to elbow measurement. And this is more technical than than I know, but they found, she had the certain measurement in here and said, okay, you're not going to win a medal in this. Have you ever considered rowing? She goes, I've never done road. Three years later, she was an Olympic champion. Watts. Yeah. You could be an Olympic rowing champion in three years, but think about if you are already a well trained athlete for something else, it involved that type of cardiovascular stuff. I have this specific biomechanics that fits. So if you know those biomechanics, sorry, you know what to look for in an athlete, you can steer them in this direction. The UK did great with metal count. That's amazing.
