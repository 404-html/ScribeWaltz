Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Oh Shit, you dirty bitches internationally known and locally recognized. Just recently escaped from the government of Canada, snuck across the border back to the United States. You must be so tired back to the belly of the beast. Back to the inside of the balls of the Dick. That's fucking the world. America. I fucking love Montreal dude. I'm a little tired, but we'll talk more. The Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by several things, but before that full even bring them the sponsors. I want to thank Green Mountain grills for hooking me up with this fucking bad ass grill hooked me up with one of these pellet grills. It's hardwood pellets. They essentially take saw dust and they, they, they make these pellets out of it and they use it to power your grill and it all goes through. It's all electrically fed. So it keeps the temperature exactly the same.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       Apparently all these, um, this dude Eric who set it up gave me the four, the four one one, all these grills that they use for these barbecue competitions, they all use pellet grills now. And the way these pellet grills work is you don't have to light anything. You don't have to fucking use lighter fluid, but it's still wood. And what it does is it all gets done in cities like I hot coil and slowly but surely the pellets get fed through a machine to the hot coil. It stays the same temperature. Do I made some of the best fucking steaks I've ever made on this thing? How long, how long did it appellate's last? Are they like one time user? I do, you know [inaudible] he turns to dust and vacuum it out. It just like it just like charcoal dust and then just buy new bags of pellets.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       And it's amazing how efficient it is. It's like one like little, like you could take a couple of cups full of pellets and you can cook a couple of steaks. Whereas if you think about how much charcoal it takes because it's not that efficient, you know when you throw on the charcoal in there, a lot of the heats lost to this works in a convection of and way. So as you close the lid on it and all my God, it's so juicy and delicious. Oh, what's the, what's the website I want to look? That's a good question. It's uh, they're called green mountain grills. Oh, it's green mountain grills.com. Um, I got the one called the Daniel Boone. There's a, there's a couple of different models, but you can cook like shoulders on these things. Like you could do like crazy shit like cook, like briskets and stuff, like stuff that you would never do because you're not going to be the smart guy who's out there like knowing exactly how much fire wood to put in the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:02:25       Cause you know, if you, if you're like smoking something that traditional way you like have a box and you've got to keep throwing wood in it, that shit's wack. Okay. You've got to get up in the middle of the night and go put some wood in there because you're fucking, your meats are going to get cold. That's stupid as fuck. You don't have to do that anymore. Although there is something pretty bad ass about that. There's something like very a craftsmen about that, about getting up in the middle of the night and stoking the fire. Apparently there's this place in Austin, Texas that has barbecue. That's fucking insane are you should fear went there and I saw it on the Anthony Bourdain show too. It started off as a food truck and this guy developed this, this way of making brisket that's fucking insane. And he does it totally old school. He gets up in the middle of the night, throws wood in the fire, he knows the right amount of shit to spray on the meat. You're like, it's all just simple salt and pepper and like a little vinegar or something, I don't know, water or whatever the fuck is using, but apparently it's unbelievable. But let's be realistic folks. You're not that fucking guy. Okay. And if you get one of these green mountain grills, you can make like some ribs. You could actually do this.

Speaker 2:          00:03:27       Can I tell you what my grill is like now? I have a thermos grail. It's five years old from target 100 buckets from therm, the thermos company. And, uh, I had some on steak and the insight paint that black paint has started to come. Oh, at the time. Yeah. It started, it has started to come onto my meat now. So I think it's, uh, it's probably very toxic. What I'm eating now. Fun. I just kind of, you scratch it off, but it's so gross because every team you're me. Yeah. And I think it's like not, it's this kind of paint that it's used to like, you know, in four inside of grills. So it's probably like heavy duty

Speaker 1:          00:04:04       baking, paint banking. Yeah. Yeah. It's probably designed by the government to keep idiots in check. Yes. I might have to figure out a way to get that paint chip, those nettle, nettle fibers getting into your head. That's the government man that I've never even heard of that happening before. That sounds terrible. That should not happen. Right know, have, look, if you're on a budget, man, just get yourself one of those kettle grill. So it was like Weber Kettle Grill. Those are fucking bad ass and they're not that expensive, relatively speaking. That's a great, yeah. I'm one of those. I have a Kamado which is very similar to the egg. It's just a little bit bigger, a little prettier. They make them like artistic. But uh, I like, I like cooking steaks on that too. But there's this, this, the beautiful thing about one of these a pellet grills is that you can't fuck it up.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       It tells you what temperature it is. 500 degrees, you know exactly how long to cook it at 500 degrees. It's a, it's pretty bad ass and you can, like I said, he can do all kinds of shit within. They're very nice. Folks were also brought to you by Ting Tang is a mobile company that we've been uh, representing on this podcast for a while. Apparently there was some apprehension about going with us. Brian, a lot of people didn't believe in the Joe Rogan experience. I thought that maybe were a tad fringe, maybe were half baked as it were. Uh, not that tech. Well, we were slightly technically oriented. You're far more technically oriented oriented than I am. But, uh, the reality is, um, it's a, it's a great fit for us. This tank company, the reason being that it's a company that's not trying to rip anybody off there, they're trying to make a respectable profit, but they're not, they're not offering you all the like sneaky shit that exists and regular cell phone contracts, like first of all, the contract itself, you know, you can't just get a phone, you have to get a contract with someone to get that phone activated.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       And in most cases with them means is if you want to cancel your service, you have to pay, you know, a, what they do is a, apparently they sort of move the numbers around. When you buy a phone's like say if you want to buy like an iPhone and if you go to any big name, store, whatever, you know, big name, cell phone company and the, and the name though, when you're paying x amount of money, it's normally more than that. So they take that money away from the price to sort of entice you into it. But the deal is if you, if you try to like take that phone and then just cancel in a month and take your, you know, x amount of dollars savings, they'll, they'll, they would lose a lot of money that way. So the way they do it as they make you pay that back, if you cancel ting, doesn't fuck with that Tang. Makes it very simple. They, they offer you the best android phones. You can get really cool ones. Like A, I have the Samsung Galaxy s three, and that's the one that's coming to Brian to um, and a, if you go to a brogan.ting.com fuck, I think that's it. Yeah. rogan.ting.com they'll give you 50 bucks off of, uh, any android phone when you start up.

Speaker 2:          00:06:51       They have a mobile hotspot, four g mobile hotspot for 125 bucks.

Speaker 1:          00:06:55       Yeah. Dude, it's a fucking great company, man. No, no joke there on the sprint backbone. So you don't have to worry about any wonky fucking backwoods service. It's an actual, real top flight, cellular backbone. And, um, because of that, they can, they can offer you what a big name company can offer you as well as offer you what this ethical, small company is, is trying to provide,

Speaker 2:          00:07:19       look, they have the cell phone tower things that you put in your house. So if you have bad service in your house, it broadcast Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       Yeah. Juices it up. It says something. What does it do? Let's, let's read what it does. So we don't give out into information

Speaker 2:          00:07:31       connects to the Internet and it broadcasts a four g signal in your house. So if you have like a live in a place that has a sketchy neighborhood, but you have great internet, you can make your own Forgy tower pretty much in. Really? Yeah. That's incredible. That is good. And it's using sprint's network and because it's connected to your Internet, I think that, I think that's even better.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       Sweet. Jesus. No, no. Does it get any better than this? Ladies and gentlemen, go to rogan.ting.com and save yourself some money. And, uh, Tim has been saying that they're getting a lot of customers from this campaign and a, we appreciate you guys supporting the people that support us on the show. And one of the things that we will promise you, 100% always is said anything we say on this show, we're never going to bullshit you. Anything we say is what we believe. And if I'm wrong, if I find out I'm wrong, I'm going to fucking tell you right away and apologize. Um, everyone needs a whole phone. Everyone needs a hoe phone. If a, especially gay dudes, let's be honest, you're not going to keep it together. You're all guys. You're going to get wacky. It's beautiful thing. Celebrate it. Get yourself a tig or if you're really gangster, get when a virgin mobile fucking flip phones and pretend to use that shift for anything other than Dick.

Speaker 1:          00:08:42       Anybody sees you enter in their number into that knows all this. One of the fucker doesn't care about me. This motherfucker's not hear from me. rogan.ting.com excellent company. They have a couple of things going him. That's great. Besides the fact that you don't have contracts. One of them is that if you, they have certain tiers like you know, use x amount of minutes. I don't know the exact system they have but, or the plans that they have. But what I do know is if you use like what a lower plan would be, they credit you on your next bill. So no one's trying to rip you off. They're trying to offer you the best cell phone service available in a way that's very ethical in a way that I think is very generous and it makes it, it makes you feel better about what you're dealing with because you know what else is out there, you know, you know, if you can deal with a company like this, like I would, I would, I like to vote with my money, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       And when there's a company like this that comes around, it's doing something cool like this. I like to support it. And so that's why they're a, that's why they're a part of the podcast. We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com and if you ever been on it before, we got a whole bunch of new shit, man. Like fucking Buffalo Jerky is this Tonka Buffalo Jerky that's made with cranberries. We got killer bee honey. Why do we have killer bee honey? Because it's gangster as fuck. That's why it's gangster as fuck to have killer bee honey. Man. I don't even, I tried it the other day. It tastes like honey. I don't give a fuck. I felt special. You don't have grocery stores in my tea. Gotcha. She had grocery stores will have like problem with like lettuce, like Eh, you know, making people sick or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       That seems like the least dangerous thing ever. But you're having killer bee honey. Yeah, it's gangster. That seems like you need that bigger insurance costs are sexy. Dude. Seem sexy. You want to rub that shit on your Dick. I bet your deck would just get hard and silly. That killer events almost venomous. It's probably delicious. It's very good for you. Official jellies are the new things that we have. We have those for kids. Um, you know, give kids a good dose of Omega Threes v Fatty Acids, which are very important for brain function development. And uh, a lot of people don't get them in their diet so they make them in almost like a candy. It's pretty cool. I just started feeding it to my kids. Hopefully it's not a science project. My sister's daughter can't read my fucking mind cause no kids from the past, I forgot like fish oil pills.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       What if the kid started their brains start developing and control and it's the next stage of evolution or not. We also sell battle ropes and kettle bells. We sell a fitness equipment. That type of the type of shit that we sale sell rather is all type of shit that I would use. We also have, um, DVDs. Now for a while people were saying like, what's the best workout you can do online? Well, there's one that I always talked up, so we just decided to start selling it. It's called the extreme kettle bell cardio, a DVD and um, it's, this guy is a fucking animal. My God's Keith Webber. Fuck what a what a what a workout. This is, it's so brutal. I do this shit. We get to that. I do this, uh, this thing with just 35 pounds and you feel like such a, it's amazing how tired you can get with just 35 pounds.

Speaker 1:          00:11:52       You'd be amazed at, like, everybody thinks that it's like hard to go to the gym and lift some weights. Lifting weights is easy. It's really easy. You know what's really hard? Lifting something that's not that heavy all lot of times and doing it with your whole body over and over and over and over and over again. It's you, you're breaking. Everything just breaks down and it's pretty safe because of the fact it's unbelievable workout in a short amount of time. But you're not doing the type of things that you do when you blow out discs and it really fuck yourself up, which is what a lot of people do when they start lifting heavy weights. Like everybody wants to be like super big. And the way to get super big is you gotta do like dead lifts and squats and all that shit with heavyweights so that your body goes, oh Jesus, we got to get bigger.

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       Well, with kettle bells, the beautiful thing is you just get stronger. It just makes your body acclimated to doing a lot of like physical work that will really manifest itself in real life situations because you're using your body all is one unit two, it'll help you with picking up stuff. It'll, it'll help you, you know, if you do any sort of sport it'll help you. But I'm a, I'm a huge, huge fan of kettle bells both in, um, there's a, you know, a bunch of schools of thought. Steve Maxwell believes in like lower weight, higher repetition, you know, extreme, uh, you know, clean form. And he's one of the masters of it as, as Mike Mahler, who's more of like a really heavyweight, shorter, smaller reps guy and he's fucking, that guy's yoked as fuck. And he's a Vegan too, which is incredible. Um, I'm rambling. It's official.

Speaker 1:          00:13:26       Listen folks, go to [inaudible] dot com get yourself some hemp protein powder. You will not test positive. Don't worry. People need to have that explained to them over and over again. Hemp protein powder is one of the best, most efficient protein powder for your body to process. Um, but it's, there's no THC in it so you can eat it and it does not come up in your system. Whereas like poppy seeds will come up as morphine or heroin. This does not, you don't have to worry about that there. Hemp is completely non psychoactive, but unfortunately we live in retarded times and we cannot grow this plant in America. We have to actually, it's legal to have, you can even buy it. You could bring it over here. You can import it. Nobody has a problem with that, but you cannot grow it. How much sense does that make?

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       Zero. So they grow it in Canada. So, uh, they grown in Canada and we have to buy it. We can't even employ American farmers on it. We wanted to start a farm. We were like, it would be beautiful because we know that Vermont has a legal hemp manufacturing and now I believe because of what happened, the the law that got passed and cal in Colorado and Washington, I think at least in one of those states, you're supposed to be allowed to grow hemp now too, but the government will arrest you. That's the bottom line on it. It's, it's, it's all based on ignorance. It's a completely non psychoactive version of uh, the, the cat, the cannabis plant. It's not the same thing as marijuana and it's illegal all because of it as a commodity and it's, it stay there, hold it down, and they keep it from farmers because it could take away a lot of different things.

Speaker 1:          00:15:03       Take them out of the market. A lot of different things that we consider standard, like ropes, nylon ropes will actually, hemp is a better fucking rope. You know, clothes, cold clothes are made out of cotton. Actually, if they were made it a hamp, they'd be better. They're more durable. Paper. It's, it makes way better paper. It, it makes so many things better and it's illegal. And it doesn't get you high. It's the whole thing is fucking crazy. If it looked completely different than pot and had a completely different name and was not related, but it was going through the same circumstances, people would be up in arms as they should be. Farmers should be up in arms about this because it's an incredibly good plant to have on your soil. You can replenish your crops in a short amount of time. It grows very fast.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       It's very healthy. You don't need pesticides. It's an incredibly strong plant. It's good for so many different fucking things, and if you try to grow it, they'll put you in a cage. They will take all your money. They will separate you from your family. They will lock you in a cage if you try to grow this awesome plant. So that's why hemp protein powder cost so much, folks. It's fucking stupid and it's fucking ridiculous. In 2012 wake up, you freaks. Wake the fuck up. Go get yourself some Alpha brain and think this shit through. Go get yourself a blender. We can no longer offer the BLENDTEC blenders with a free hemp force. They have ra, they have Lou rules as to how you sell shit because it doesn't, it just makes it too desirable.

Speaker 2:          00:16:33       Maybe you should have a thing like every time you sell over $300 you get a free him force.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       Can't do it. Oh like anything from this from that's a good idea. Like anything from the whole store. Yeah, we'll put that into play. We'll speak to Aubrey about that. Get that shit in motion. All right. This fucking commercials really long and Tim Ferriss is here so let's get this party started. You dirty anything to add? Anything promote isn't going on and he shows,

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       oh, I'll be with Doug Benson Wednesday and San Diego at the American Comedy Co. Jesus Christ son, comedy co.com. It's a good club down there too. Very, very perfect little comedy club and we'll have a desk squad show there. The 12 1212 also and I think there's a, the other place is really good too. That Matt House. Yeah, that place is good. I want you to go, there you go. Make a comeback. Bitches. All right folks. That's it. It's fucking, let's get a girl hit that. Hit that button. Let's talk. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:17:23       Crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       The Joe Rogan experience.

Speaker 3:          00:17:28       Try it my day. Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. Boom.

Speaker 1:          00:17:34       Bitches back with new knowledge and information. Tim Ferriss joins the podcast. My brother, thank you for coming back, man. Oh, it's great to be back. I've been looking forward to this one for months. Dude. I've been looking forward to how you want to. I'm a glad we were able to work this out time wise. You're very busy character.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       You too. Do you have a four day marriage? Is that out yet? You know, people have asked for the floor for our marriage and I'm like, you know, that'd be easy to write given the rate of divorce. It's like I can find it. I can do those interviews for our Presidency Ninja until I figure it out. It's not going to read a book for our CEO. Yeah. A lot of those too. There's a lot of those too. Yeah. Um, your, uh, your new book is, what is it called? The four hour commercial. That's me, man. I'm the master. That shit. The four hour chef, four hour chef. Simple path to cooking like a pro learning anything in living the good life. It's a very narrow scope that's not announced scope at all. How dare you confusing me. I'm not as smart as you settle down.

Speaker 4:          00:18:33       Well, this is the second. This is probably the first time I've actually had some TAC, my system since the last podcast. Well that's ridiculous. What a coincidence. Attribute that to Tim Ferriss is pure knowing that the government is listening and all. So we always like to hydrogen like the government. Know you guys are talking about trying to pretend like the government is spying on us. But meanwhile we broadcast his shit on our Internet show. That's how you know you're a stoner. You're like, dude, what if the governments listen to his podcast right now? Dude, thousands of people who listen to this fucking thing right now. Oh yeah. Fuck the government. Why are they listening? Why do they care? Um, for our government, is that possible? Maybe that we form government. We might be past that point. You could have a four hour countdown clock. Do you think that's happening?

Speaker 4:          00:19:18       Well, you worried? Yeah, I'm worried. Are you worried about, uh, what's going on in Israel and the Gaza Strip on board? Not only about that but also honestly, but just the financial integrity this entire country. Yeah. And it seems fake. All right. I know exactly. And you know, the financial integrity. So yeah, there's a really, there's a really good book called the biography of a dollar which talks about just the development of the currency of the US dollar and where it is today. And the conclusion of all of those books is basically like buy shotguns by food. We'll get something in a different currency. And um, what was kind of wild is, so what I was looking at the uh, doing research for the four hour chef and we've got into this the wild stuff and we can talk about that, but like the foraging and tufting and all these things that never done.

Speaker 4:          00:20:00       And I went a little bit off the rails and started meeting all these survivalists and preppers and whatnot. And so I ended up writing like 150 pages that to cut because I just went ballistic in more ways than one just to researching all this shit. But, uh, and I had a number of close friends in San Francisco, New York, thought I was fucking nuts. And then hurricane sandy comes along. Whoa. So they thought that you were taking this way too far and you had lost your mind and you were proposing and probable scenarios and then hurricane sandy and now everybody has to think it's amazing how fragile our, our life is here on this planet. We essentially, you know, live without a roof. Most of the time the world is a convertible. Yeah. You know, and above us is all this shit is flying around. There's, there's like thousands of times every day a piece of rock from outer space comes into the atmosphere and burns up.

Speaker 5:          00:20:48       Yeah. Like people need to wrap their heads around that. All right. This is crazy. This does not have to, just because this has been here as a city for a hundred years doesn't mean it has to stay like this. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:20:59       Well, no, exactly. And um, so Nassim Taleb who wrote the Black Swan fooled by randomness, he's a really good example, which is, you know, the Turkey thinks that things are going great all the, all the way up until thanksgiving, you know, like just the fact that he's had 364 days of live in pretty doesn't mean three 65 is going to be very brilliant.

Speaker 5:          00:21:18       I always use if my, my analogy is the ant hill analogy that there could be an ant hill that exists in a field and it's a big ant hill and these ants have been working in this ant hill for God knows how long and they only live for like a short amount of time. So it's been there long before they were ever born. This ant hills existed in its many fucking complicated caverns. And then one day this little kid comes along and stops the fucking shit out of that hill and no one saw it coming. It never happened before. So they never even considered it. They just fucking go about their day. And this little kid comes along and stomped the shit out of that anthill. And that's exactly what happened with Hurricane Katrina. That's exactly what happened with Sandy. That's what could happen with Yellowstone Jeliboo.

Speaker 5:          00:22:01       Yeah. Or any sort of an earthquake. I mean, I have a friend who has a house. He has a vacation house on the beach in Malibu. It is so bad ass. You sit there and be like, you're on the ocean. And it's like, it's such a humbling experience to have an, it's like something like very, it just connects you. It's some weird way to nature when you're staring at that water. I think that's why beach communities are so chill. You know, beach communities are like, every day you're confronted with this reality that you ain't shit. Okay. You stop and look out there, do it. As far as you can see is water and you die out there. You can't make it. And if for some reason it just switches back and forth a little, it's going to wipe out everything for a hundred miles in like it's nothing. Okay. So settle the fuck down and stop taking yourself so seriously. Like that's the feeling that you get when you're right next to water. I think that's important for people. I think

Speaker 6:          00:22:56       it is. I think it's also the, the sort of meditative aspect of the, of the waves. I think

Speaker 5:          00:23:01       I have, it gives you a feeling, it gives you like a peaceful feeling when you're like sitting around and like, you're in Hawaii and you look at it that water, you know, you're on top of a volcano, you know the shit is temporary as fuck, but you're like, I didn't. Yeah, right now it's beautiful right now. It's amazing, you know,

Speaker 6:          00:23:16       or to, you know, I grew up on long island way out at the end and apart. What does that like mes at Montauk. So I grew up as a townie, like a rat rat tail wearing townie Hamptons. And you start thinking about, let's just say, uh, you know, climate change. And then you look at the, the wealth concentration in the first 10 to 20 miles of every coastline. It's like 80% of the world's wealth would just be wiped out if there's a dramatic temperature change. And with Hurricane Sandy, what's, what's not amused, it's depressingly amusing to me is when people are like, oh, that's a one in 100, one in 1,000,001. And if you look at, uh, there was a piece in nature magazine, this is just in the last, I think few months where they said if climate change continues as predicted, 100 year storms will have to happen every three years.

Speaker 6:          00:24:06       I took a, uh, a training course in San Francisco that was done by the police department, the fire department, which was the northern California emergency response training nerd. And in the first class, this is the police. This isn't some Wacko like paranoid, uh, dooms doomsday a predictor. He said, all right, let's do an exercise. How many people are there in San Francisco? Something like, wow, I don't know, whatever, 800,000. Right, okay. If everyone's commuting in like a couple of million, whatever it might be. Okay. How many fire engines do you think there are in San Francisco? And everyone's like 102 hundred 50 whatever it was. It was something like 19 and he said, what that means is if you look at like the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 it could be seven to 10 days before anybody gets to, like, you cannot rely on the existing structure and that kind of blew my mind.

Speaker 6:          00:24:52       I was like, even though it's amazing, 10 days, it's amazing. Get it done that fast. I after Sandy, I'm like, well, there's look, they don't have a backup plan for something massive. You know what? They have coffins. Yeah, right. They have those plastic coffins. They save up in case a fucking asteroid hits us. They don't have like some crazy plan to feed everybody. They have a plan to go overseas and Jack people and take their oil. No plan to take care of the people in case if there's some sort of an earthquake or something. Oh yeah, no, there's, there's no possible response that would cover it. And so would you know what I figured out is I started doing the math and I was like, well, I spend, because I've broken myself like a thousand times, I spend 500 $600 a month in health insurance and I don't even have 20 gallons of water and food and a shotgun and a few things, which would cost what, 500,000 bucks total onetime cost.

Speaker 6:          00:25:42       I have a friend who has a solar powered house. That's cool. That's cool. That's gotta be the way to go. Especially out here and just even a cheap generator. Like, uh, I had the power go out on my block in San Francisco for 24 hours and I realized all my food is going bad. I had like 80 pounds of meat, no power supplies. So I got a, I think it's a Honda. I like to EU 2009 I generator that's popular, popular burning man and then a bunch of extra gasoline and I would not buy it just for that. Well, I can get a burning smell every, I can go to burning man with the rest of San Francisco to see all my friends. Why don't I smelled like petroleum? Listen burning man. People relax. I'm just joking. I don't what you getting angry at me? Fuck you dude.

Speaker 6:          00:26:26       Why is it aggro problem with burning man? I don't really, I'm just completely joking. Can you just say shit just to say shit sometimes everybody's going to take everything so fucking seriously. Um, yeah, I think that generators are an awesome idea. Yeah, that's a good idea to have around. It's far though. If live in an apartment with the fuck do you do, then you could actually pull it off and the owners and I thought I figured this out. Open the window or something. And then you just have to have an exhaust exhaust pipe going out the window. So you get some coil up thing. In that case. How long does it stay on? It depends on the gasoline. You have a, I mean I have maybe 10 gallons of gasoline and this, this generator. What's, what's great about it is it looks like an old school like desktops server or really?

Speaker 6:          00:27:08       Yeah, it's tiny. It looks like one of those towers. It's not heavy at all. It probably weighs 30 pounds. And how does the gas tank connect to it? What does it look like? Cause it like you pour the gasoline right right into the generator itself. Yeah. It's really well done. How old? How many gowns? I don't know. Off Hand. Yeah, I found I had it. So how long does it stay with like one fill up and you turn it on? How long does it stay on? I honestly am not sure I have everything ready to go, but I couldn't fit more than a 10 gallons of gasoline in my apartment. Isn't it fucked up. Thinking about that. Like thinking about alternative ways to keep the power on. That's fucking terrifying. Yeah. Everyone should at least get a Red Cross endorsed hand wind up powered radio, which also doubles as a charger.

Speaker 6:          00:27:52       You can get these for like 40 bucks on Amazon. Power's out. Won't the radio be out too? Well it can. Uh, you can actually use different frequencies. So I mean like the ham radio is crazy as it seems, is actually a pretty good to have a pretty good skill to pick up. Like that's what the fire department police department, they're like all those wines are the catch patos right. It could be one of them. Or Dungeons and dragons players again, which I was not slamming Ralph. That's what you are gray alf has a grail. Wow. Yeah. Um, you had 80 pounds of meat in your house. I'll have more now. I have about 120 pounds. Three charters. Are you eating? Are you eating homeless? Cleaning up the streets, gentrify your neighborhood. Try it. And so we have a, we have a mutual friend now. Steve Rinella.

Speaker 6:          00:28:41       Yeah. And uh, I, so just to give some context. So growing up on long island, Steve Rinella, for folks who don't know a meat mediator, he's an author actually as well. It's got a book called [inaudible], which is fantastic. Brilliant. Right? It's a very good, brighter man. Yeah, I'm really good. Very bright guy. So I met, I met Steve when I was investigating how to reconnect with ingredients as part of this book. And I think above and beyond that how to correct like manual illiteracy, right? So one of the things that really started to bother me in the last few years is I looked at like what my dad could do, my granddad could do, I can't fix half the things on my car. I can't do basic like woodwork. I can't do any of that shit. And I realized it was really causing me a lot of anxiety not to build things with my hands.

Speaker 6:          00:29:25       So food and foraging and all this stuff became another way, are one way to try to reclaim that. And then Steve, I met through a bunch of different random circumstances. Uh, and what he countered was my image of a hunter because growing up on long island, I had a lot of injured deer come across my property from people who didn't know how to bow hunt beer cans on the side of my, on this, on like my side of my driveway. And I just developed this real hatred. It was that strong for hunters and just saw them as really responsible, wasteful kind of jerk offs. And then I met Steve and uh, so I'll give a little, you've probably heard this story, but what blew me away about Steve is he'll say, look, there are a lot of better hunters than me, although he's a really good hunter. And I said, there are a lot of better cooks than me, but I'm a decent cook. But they're very few people who can put them together. And so he took for one of his books, I guess was the, uh, scavengers guide to Haute cuisine. He, he took this 1906, uh, scoffed a banquet. SCAF he's like the grandfather of French cuisine, three day banquet, like 40 different dishes with all this weird shit, sting rays and you know, quail stuffed with steer Chin or who the fuck

Speaker 1:          00:30:34       no was he served people raccoon that he found on the side of the road. Yeah. And he would, he didn't.

Speaker 6:          00:30:38       Particular three day banquet is, he killed and forged everything. He got every ingredient then read and then recreated the entire three day thing himself. Guy's a stud. Yeah. He's an amazing dude. Oh, so for the, he took me on my first ever hunt, which was a white tail deer hunt. And then most recently we went to Alaska for about a week in the middle of nowhere to hunt Caribou.

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       So we are successful both times I was, yeah, that was so the whitetail deer was your first experience the first time and where did you go there?

Speaker 6:          00:31:05       That was South Carolina because in California you have to fill out like a phone books worth of paperwork to get anything done with hunting in South Carolina, you just buy the hunting license online and you're done. Beautiful

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       people of South Carolina. God bless you. God bless you for fucking keeping the bureaucracy and check. Um, so you, your idea about wanting to hunt was probably similar to what my idea was. It was like, I eat meat. I have no connection to it. I'm just buying it as to, I know this isn't healthy. It's a kid. I, I likened it to the idea of being born rich. It's like I didn't really understand what it was like to earn it. I didn't in any way, shape or form. And there's a lot of people that have a lot of misunderstandings about hunting too. And I shared those when I was young. I, I had a very ignorant appearance, uh, opinion on hunting too. I just thought it was just people who like, why would you kill an animal and you can just go to the store and get it for free or you know, buy it without to have to deal with that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:59       Like these people probably want to kill animals. Like, well why don't you leave the animals alone? Then one day I was driving from a Gig, I was in Boston or in New York rather and I was an upper western Massachusetts and I had to drive down and I got to go like 30 fucking miles an hour cause he's dear just kept jumping in front of my car. It was crazy. I just kept seeing them over and over and over again. They were all over the road. So I had to drive really slow on the way home. And it was a really common thing on this one parkway where deer would get hit by cars. Yeah. I mean it was an infestation because if you're looking at that much on the actual road, off to the right and off to the left, there's fucking woods, man. So who knows how many God damn deer there. Those

Speaker 5:          00:32:40       deer, first of all, they're going to get hit by cars. They're going to starve because they're going to run out of food. And if they don't have hunters managing that population, there's only one other option. And that option is predators. So you have two options. You have something that can kill a fucking deer with its face and you're going to have a good population of those motherfuckers running around and you're just going to trust that they're not going to get you and your dog and your kids, or you're going to, you're going to manage that population by shooting them and eating them. Yeah. And it's a, it's a really fascinating sort of a situation when you really understand it for what it is. Like it's wildlife management. They have to do this because we are at the top of the food chain. So we have to take responsibility for that situation.

Speaker 5:          00:33:24       We have game and it's everywhere. And if you don't eat it slowly but surely that mountain lion population is going to start creeping up. That's just how nature deals with shit or that, or the human population's going to start dropping because they become disease vectors for things like lymes disease. And my brothers had lives these, my dad's had Lyme disease, upstate New York. It's a real issue. Yeah, I've heard quite a few people get it. Yeah, it's too, there's only one issue. There's a, there's a lot and the fucking, it's great meat. It's like really good for you. It's better for you than cows you buy in a store that had been fed corn and uh, other, an unnatural things for cows. It's way healthier for you. Um, my, my experience was a, my whole life. I'd thought about it one way. And then that one trip home I started reconsidering like, this is fucking crazy.

Speaker 5:          00:34:09       And then I started looking at, but there was no internet back then, you know, so I'd have to like read a book, which is really annoying. I've sat down there and I mean, I don't mind reading a book now, but when I was 20 or whenever the fuck this was, you know, like why, why the fuck are so many deers? And then as I looked into all this shit, I realized like, oh, they'd like, they, there's arguments about managing them and they're just like, get the game, the fish and game and the hunters and like everyone has to come to an agreement of how many there are. And I go, what? This is crazy. You've got these fucking, they're like rats. They're like giant rats. Giant rats are run in front of your car and commit suicide. It's fucking bananas. Um, and they, they taste delicious and then you could shoot that with this and it's free.

Speaker 5:          00:34:48       You just have to pay for the license and then hit him in the right spot. They get this stressed than meat's no good. Oh, is that true? It can make it really a distasteful if you get what's called a red cutter. So for instance, if you fuck it up and you injure it and then you chase it, what you shouldn't do, number one, if you get a good shot and then you finally kill the thing, um, the, the, uh, the access of adrenaline and whatnot can really can, is that true? Because my deer, I shot it and went down and it was, uh, it was going to die, but it was still alive in the next shot. It again, I had to shoot it again. Yeah. I think it depends a lot on the duration of that sort of that stress. So what happens a lot, for instance, of novice bow hunters, and I'm not above a hundred. Like they'll go in the woods for hours with a bow and then instead of waiting for it to dial, chase it and we'll run and run around, run around, run for like an hour.

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       Right. And that, and then drop. But that's flooded with adrenaline. Yeah. I mean, and again, I'm super nervous, but based on what Steve told me, also like depending on what gender dear you hit and if it's during mating season or not. So if you hit like a ruddy buck is just pumped full of hormones, naturally occurring hormones, then I can end up being pretty. And what if that's an aphrodisiac when the deer is like super horny and you eat it's meat but seems kind of homosexual. I gotta be honest with you. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. But if it works, it works. I mean like what you're eating tiger dicks or whatever the fuck it is. A Chinese people. Yeah, you're kind of not tasty. It's very, I mean it's, it's Inter Inter species, you know, you're mixing species up, but it's also sort of homosexual anyway.

Speaker 4:          00:36:25       Yeah. I have the whole penis in China. Not Tasty. I don't recommend it. We serve that shit on fear factor and served a water buffalo dicks. I saw that. I saw that upset when you had all the different variations. That was just one, one time where I was like, this is the most ridiculous job on earth. The other time was when we served them. Um, donkey seaman. Ugh, that's, that's what canceled the show. They got so crazy. They serve donkey seating. The producers lost their fucking minds and soda at NBC because NBC said Yes to it. That's the dirty secret about the last season of fear factor. They approved NBC approved, sucking down a big golf of donkey come. They're like, Yup, that seems like good thing to put on TV. Let her rip as disgusting. Dude. It was the only time. There's only been two times when I disagreed with the producers.

Speaker 4:          00:37:11       I said, you really shouldn't do this. One time when we made them ride bowls, I was like, this is crazy. This is, you can't control this. This is, this is not good. I didn't like it. And then the other time when we made them drink calm, I just never thought I'd have to say that. I'd never thought I'd have to say, I don't think he should serve those people at donkey coffee. It's just, it just doesn't see, it just seems like we're crossing a line. If you'd like this job and you want to keep it, and then TMZ got ahold of it, they put the pictures of it online and then NBC said Polish Owl Polish out. They pulled the episode. What response did they expect? They were thinking, man, if I'm the guy who's telling you you're crossing the line. Yeah, you're already there. You know I'm a pothead cage fighting commentator and I'm telling you, you're going to far, everything in my life is fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:38:02       Every everything I do, whether it's standup comedy or this podcast, everything could be considered fucked up. And I'm like, you're going crazy. I'm like, you get it. You get into chicky over here. You gotta, you gotta let that one go. You can't, they can't drink. Come and pissed by the way we serve them. Pissed too. Nobody seem to care as much about the piss. I wouldn't care as much about the past. The past is they just drank it and nobody complained about the pit. So it was always the donkey come and it always was like, again, it was like some sort of beastiality thing in people's minds because it's a body fluid and we know where it came from. Like milk.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       Yeah, but it's not like we're asking them to have sex. It's so funny a week people connect, flex sex with the fluids at sex creates, you know, it's like drinking the like, you know you're no where near that donkey when it comes, but drinking, it's come somehow or another is a sex with that donkey. I'm not sure I could rationalize myself. The drinking donkey come like as hard as I tried to make it into the like and thought exercise. Well what's fucked up is two people had a drink and they didn't want shit. That's what's fucked up cause everybody drank it. Yeah. One guy and two girls drank it and they were nice people. That's what's even more fucked up than there were very nice. Always the nice quiet time drank the donkey semen for all of them. They were, I mean it was like he took, occasionally you have a show where someone will try too hard or they're build noxious.

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       We didn't have any of that. This last season of fear factor was they were, everyone was like really there a knife. Nice folks. So I felt bad sitting down there drinking talky come. I'd hate to see it digested like the next morning shit sitting on the toilet blowing out. Quite honestly. It's very similar to phlegm. So it's like drinking almost like drinking a big glass of phlegm. You know it's really very similar. It's very similar in its texture. And you know, I dunno about taste cause you know I never tried phlegm. Ha wonder if you get the job, where the fuck is his podcast? What have you flagged when you flush the toilet after digesting, if it's like a super fast, like a flesh is really, really fast because it's slippery because of all the phlegm, right? Hmm. I don't know what kind of, Oh what the fuck you're saying you need to go to a doctor. Frill need to go to a doctor and just tell him that you propose that and he'll sit you down and go, something's wrong with your brain. Um, so, uh, your first deer hunting experience was in North Carolina, was it South Carolina? Which is the gun. Oh, would you?

Speaker 6:          00:40:32       It was gone. I didn't want to, my biggest fear going into all of that was fucking up the shot. It was really worried about just maiming the deer and then it takes away like hitting of the leg or something. I was really worried about that. So I took, I really got into the marksmanship super serious. It was actually just down here a couple of weeks ago doing sniper training with some of the La Swat team members. Oh yeah. There's a great, a company called itts that does trainings are fucking, they were great. But prior to that, so that the deer, I used a seven millimeter Remington mag that I actually use Steve's gun, which is a lefthanded too. It's a nice gun. It's great gun. I have since had a right handed version of that made with a couple of changes. So it's like a his and hers, soon millimeter of Steve Vernella now. Nice. But I used, I used his gun and a man, he's a great teacher. I mean that's part of, there's, I want to put them in the book. He is a fucking outstanding, outstanding teacher. Well he knows what he's doing.

Speaker 4:          00:41:32       All aspects of uh, the whole a hunting thing cause it's his, his attachment to it isn't just hunting. It's also to, um, just the, the history of the United States and, and the people that lived in the land of the, the uh, American Indian hitter heritage and the stories. He had some amazing American Indian stories. Like really, uh, I should say native American stories. Really, really interesting stuff about that whole area where we went to Montana, to the Missouri River. The rosary breaks. Yeah. And he had just incredible stories, story after story. So he's a guy that like really embraces the history of a region two and the, the history of the wildlife there as well. How the uh, migrate with the numbers used to be like, and you know, we, we occasionally would, uh, look for buffalo bones cause they're like really common in the sides of hills.

Speaker 4:          00:42:23       You know, you see like the, when the Strada wears away you'll, you'll find like these old ass fucking buffalo bolts. Krill. Yeah, that's super cool. It's pretty bad ass. And Steve, I mean he grew up hunting with his brothers. Obviously this dad as well. And I think his brothers, they're both in the sciences, but I believe they're Bostick both ecologists and it's just such, it's a fascinating family. And I mean Steve, I guess he's been writing for money for whatever it is, a decade maybe. But he started trapping in from honey in Rome, Michigan and he was like 10. Yeah. Yeah. He was talking about how his dad pulled him out of school for a first day of trap and, and first day of hunting season. That's like how he grew up. I think that's fucking awesome. But it's, it's fascinating because everybody immediately, if you think of a guy like that, you think of a dumb guy.

Speaker 4:          00:43:14       You think of an uneducated guy and unworldly guy, he's the exact opposite of total opposite. Brilliant guy, brilliant guy. Very, very well read and a really fun to talk to. You know, he's inquisitive is intelligent, you know, he's on the ball but he's the real fucking deal, you know? And he expects that from other people as well. You know, you go on a hunt with them, you're going on. I mean you're, you're going, it's legit. Yeah. When we were in Alaska where we got dropped off, I was like five hours in north of Fairbanks flight time and we got dropped off on the side of a lake by a Bush plan. And I like seeing awake pace. I'll get eaten by bears. And then Lo and behold, it never got dark because we were, we were above the Arctic circle and we had two huge grizzly bears repeatedly tried to come into our camp because the people before us would let the fucking gut pile of Caribou like 200 yards upwind. So we had these two huge bears come in and uh, Steve was so funny cause everyone's like, oh fuck grizzly bear like 10 o'clock. And it's like, I dunno, ETA three minutes. And then Steve found that his found out his cell phone had been like in the bottom of his bag and was soaked with deet. And he's like, fuck my fucking cell phone. Everyone's like Steve, a grizzly bear ETA three minutes. He's like my fucking cell phone. She's like so unconcerned

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       about this grizzly bear. And then he's just like, all right, fine, fuck it. And he picks up a shotgun, like walks over with birdshot like starts firing it off and waving his arms and scaring it off from like, that's all you need to do a hundred yards. But here's the thing, a hundred yards to a bear, that's not a slow animal. Right? So he's got some big balls. I scared it off the thing that running back like two hours later, but to say about him after he gets fucking eaten, you know exactly. He big balls and the bear ultimately eight. So they set about grizzly man until the very end. He really knows those bears stay safe. Yeah. I think Steve, Steve is fine to be within a hundred yards of the bear as long as he has a good, a good a firearm. Yeah. You got to really, um, when you straw inspecting the fucking Grizzly, that's when the grizzly takes care of you to shoot a grizzly. Like you can't shoot it with like a little pistol. No. You need to hit it with like a slug because you're not going to stop them. It's going to take years for them to die. Like if you shoot it, if you shoot a big grizzly with a fucking nine millimeter, you know, he tried to go gangster rapper style on them. That's not going to kill a bear. Keep running at you and you're going to be so scared when it eats your head. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:45:35       If people underestimate how hard it is to kill an animal like that, depending on the circumstances. I was talking to a friend of mine who's a navy seal and he sees still enlisted, I mean he does deployments and everything, but he was at one point in Africa and these villagers in sort of the downtime knew these guys were with the military and they said, hey, could you help us call this herd of water buffalo because they're destroying all our property and blah blah blah. We can make food out of the boat, the buffalo that you kill you. I'm like, sure. So they had these long range sniping rifles and he said that and he's a damn good shot. I've done some training with them and he, and he said that he shot a water buffalo right in the corner of the eye and the thing like shook his head and then looked straight back at him and just kept on eating.

Speaker 6:          00:46:20       Like what? Yeah, the fucking skulls like that thick. And it had like gone halfway in the skull and just lodged with a high power rifle. And the thing just kept on eating. And so like that is what would happen if you didn't place your shot with a bear. And forget it. Like if the grizzly powered rifle and it couldn't get through his fucking head, they had to aim the, ended up having to aim at the base of the skull from the side of the bag. It's don't shoot him in the head. Became the, became the rule. That's a big fucking animal. Yeah. Well when I was, uh, I was in Africa doing research for this book too. I went on to India, Japan, all over the place. Then in the one lunar in South Africa. What a buffalo kill everybody. I mean, people are afraid of that.

Speaker 6:          00:47:01       The lions, but you, if you meet, let's say the Masai Mara, these warriors who are like jump up and down, the famous for the red robes, they're not free to lines at all. They will, they'll walk off into the darkness with their big walking stick going from one village to the next. They're like, Eh, like big house cats will scare him off water, Buffalo, hippo and elephants. Those are the ones that are all afraid of because they'll just charge you and kill you. Yeah. Water buffaloes are big fuck and tourists get out of their cars on safari. They're like, oh, let's take a picture with the, and then the cows

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       are like cow Lamborghini bowls and then they get, I've talked about this a bunch lately, so I can't, uh, I can't really go into it again, but yeah. Have you seen relentless enemies? No. This was what I'm talking about. I've talked about it so many times in the podcast. You have to watch it. It's a documentary. I'll just give you the brief documentary about a part of Africa where the rivers changed courses and it's isolated. These lions with water buffalo, that's their only prey. So the lines of grown enormous. The female lions are the size of male lions. It's an amazing documentary. There's a couple different prides in the silent, but one of them is fucking huge. They're like hulk lions. That's awesome. They just jack and water buffaloes, man. That's how they have to do it now. And you see how big a fucking water buffalo is when you see five lions struggling to take it to stay down there.

Speaker 4:          00:48:15       No joke. Fuck that man. If you see when those things in the wild do not fuck with it. Yeah. Apparently back in the day, like that was a big deal with buffalo too. Like if you, if you got near at Buffalo and the buffalo charged you, I saw a video of a guy getting charged by a buffalo on youtube. You know, you don't think for whatever reason that you're gonna die by Buffalo. But that moment when that thing is going through and you realize how fucking big it is and you go, what am I doing here? I'm in fun of this crazy fucking star wars looking animal. Yeah. You're going to get hit by something always weighs more than a Volkswagen Golf with, with skull plates on the its head, not gonna end well at all. It must have been amazing back in the day when the native Americans would run into these Kurds that was far as the eye could see of these things because they really didn't have many natural predators.

Speaker 4:          00:49:09       No, not at all. I mean wolves, but it takes a lot fricking wolves to take down a buffalo. Yeah, they probably were fine. It must have been so many wolves. The wolves Musta ate great because there was so many buffalo. What other being after the saber tooth tiger, which was what? The place to scene, what was that like 14,000 years ago? Was that what it was when the, the wooly mammoths and saber tooth tigers also she goes to what other animal would eat them? It will only be wolves and mountain lions where I could a mountain lion even I take out, I don't think so because I think mount line more as a stock and pounds type of animals opposed to the endurance running like, I don't know if you've seen planet earth, the series where they have an aerial shot of wolves hunting. I think it was a Caribou may have been an elk and how they basically the wolves would run, this is trippiest thing.

Speaker 4:          00:50:00       When you see it from the air, they'll, they're almost like a Peloton and the Tour de France, so they have like the wolf in the front who is tiring out the Caribou and then like the replacement runner will come from the back and fill in and that guy will drop back and say they just run this relay race where they, they, they tag in and tag out on running this animal until it drops and then then they take it out. Holy Shit. Like persistence hunting sort of. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Which they still do and certain

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       parts of Africa they, they'll chase over. Yeah. Gazelle or whatever the fuck it is down until it just runs out of gas. Yeah, pretty wild. And then they stab it. Fuck. How long does that take? I guess that could only be done in a place like Africa where you need the heat and you'd also need the higher heat. Oh, right, right, right. Animal to overheat. You right, right, right. That makes sense because that was the weirdest thing about a deer. When you open them up, how hot they are and the only side it's like, it's really kind of like, whoa. It's a real eye opener. Yeah. What was really trippy. So the field dressing, right. So I was, I was much more interested in what happens after pulling the trigger then before you stock this dear. How'd you do it this year? The first year this was done from blind, so it was really, didn't have to work as hard on the hunt.

Speaker 6:          00:51:11       Certainly compared to Caribou with the Caribou, we did have to stock. So you did both with Rinella? We did both. Which is an ally. And the first one when, how long ago was it first one that had to be a year and a half ago or maybe even a slightly less because he had the other show the wild within? Uh, no, no, I don't think so. It was a new show. So the deer hunt was not filmed for mediator. The caribou hunt was a, for me to hit her. So the deer hunt was just you guys? The deer hunt was just because I, I met Steve and I said, you're my guy. If I am ever going to hunt, like you're the guy who's good, who is the best option for guiding this and got along and uh, both have pretty fucking strange senses of humor and went to South Carolina and you think he has a strange sense of humor?

Speaker 6:          00:51:56       I think he has a, he can depends on how much wine we've had. Uh, when we were camping, what was great is we had these fucking bags of wine because they were from the boxes, but they had been taken out and they looked just like an ivy bag. So I've been like fantasizing about getting these like rolling carts from the hospital, like supply store and just get any fucking ivy bags of wine that people can drink for like a camel back at dinner, just to creep the shit out of everybody. Those camelbaks or fun. Either you, you, um, you were in a warm weather area. Was it a warm weather time south in South Carolina? It was. So we had to be really careful about keeping all the meat cool. That's part of the reasons that you need to, one of the reasons you need to remove the internal organs so quickly so that the meat doesn't spoil.

Speaker 6:          00:52:40       Right. And uh, what was super trippy for me because I've just never experienced anything quite like it was when I was doing the field dressing, maybe a minute or two into the process. Like I just felt like I had done it before and I had this like hard wiring moment where, uh, I was just really good at it and it's done. That doesn't happen with many things. And I was starting to ice and made me think about like how to orphan cats, know how to hunt, how to orphan to anything, fill in the blank. I see no more specific than knowing how to hunt. But I mean, it just like to take it apart and it felt so natural going through it. Well, how'd she has been with obviously this, you're a very smart guy, so this had been something you had considered for quite a while before you actually went hunting. But I never read about the field dressing because I want

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       it to have an intellectually honest first experience for my readers and to be able to convey that to them. So I did not study butchering field dressing, anything. The only thing I studied was the marksmanship, so it didn't want to fuck it up. One of the things I liked about his show as opposed to a lot of other hunting shows was the fact that he did do a lot of the field dressing on the air, did show you what was going on. So I had a better sense of it. I'd seen a lot of hunting shows before. Like I'd watch Ted Nugent's show a lot, but um, he doesn't clean them as much and it doesn't like do it. You'll do it occasionally, but Steve did it quite a bit and it was very, you know, you get to see like that's, that's realistic shit man.

Speaker 4:          00:54:02       Like that's, you really see what an animals like when you get a steak, you know, okay, this is, let's back it up. Here's the animal, now it's dropped. Now you open it and then you turn it to stake, like, Whoa, that's a completely different experience. And uh, it was, it was fascinating to go through it for the first time, but also document the whole thing in terms of photos and videos and everything else all the way until that night when we had some backstraps. She kind of like the spinal erectors. Dude. You're talking like a hunter? Yeah, well I'm using Stevie, Steve Rainelda's Vocab, a Yolo, the backstraps. It was trippy about that because I'm, I think about anatomy just in terms of training and weightlifting, deadlifts and blah, blah, blah. And so thinking like a back strap since then, I went back to, uh, where we were staying with a guy named Dave amick who builds custom rifles.

Speaker 4:          00:54:52       And they had this little labradoodle that came around, was play with a labradoodle. And I started like feeling it's back and it's, anatomy was so weird and I was like, is it weird that I'm like looking for backstraps on this labradoodle? No, no, no, no, no. And Steve's like, don't worry. Like I, when I give my wife a back massage, I think the same thing. So weird. But it's like when you're actually taking an animal part and thinking about the anatomy, you start seeing those cuts in that anatomy and like everything that moves, it's really fucking weird. Well, when you see an animal for a purveyor of meat and now you see it as a meat container. Yeah, new experience. Yeah. It's weird. I went to Chrysler

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       Birthday party last night and they had one of those things. It was like a box where you put a pig inside and then you put like coals on top of the box a bit and they buried underground or something. But again, I guess it cooks faster than burying it underground. It only takes like three to four hours or something like that. But uh, it was amazing watching them take the pig out and then like Burt, which is digging in their like taking out parts of the pig and then like, then cutting out the meat. This is Burt's birthday cards, birthday party. It made me feel like such a pussy watching like all these men. Just, I'd taken this pig apart like, like they all knew exactly what to do. Like I would be like disgusted by it, but eh

Speaker 4:          00:56:09       really? So you look at like the whole pig, you were like this is too much seeing the whole pig. It was really creepy. It was creepy. I thought it was creepy to watch because it's an actual body instead of like cut of box. Makes it creepier though. Cause it's like a coffin for a instead of just being

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       in the ground. Yeah. You think? Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:56:26       I, I think um, the, that never really bothered me but maybe I looked at things differently. I Dunno. Maybe if I wasn't, it snuck up on me. I've been thinking about it for so long, but by the time I went hunting I'd been thinking about it for at least 10

Speaker 6:          00:56:40       near, so I wanted to do it for at least 10 years. I'd always, I'd always wanted to feel more conscious and aware, just like responsible for the food that I eat, including the meat. And I just, I didn't know that someone like Steve existed, you know what I mean? It's like men. And then I'm like, yeah, well I don't think there's many like him. Maybe his brothers. Yeah, there's the pig laying in that. Oh, that's wild. That's Kinda creepy. Looking at that pig. Looks like it looks like a refrigerator that looks like a Peta advertisement. Yeah. Right. And then, then there's a, that's sorry. Then like the pig head. Oh, chimney Burt's body. Like a photo of Bert. Oh, the head is certainly weird. That's cool though. The pig cooking like a pig on a spit, essentially a whole pig. And they did it at his place. It was pretty sweet and his man cave. And uh, I, I completely understand by the way, where everyone's coming from, Vegan

Speaker 5:          00:57:39       everyone was coming from, was a complete animal lover and doesn't want to have anything to do with eating meat. I fucking here. And I think it's a very noble way of thinking. If you really look at what they're doing, they're essentially trying to be a part of the next stage of evolution when it's done through the right or the most moral for the more, most moral reasons. They're trying to exist with the very minimal Karma with no death, no, no damage to the planet. But the reality of this environment that we live in now, this world is this existence, this of this dimension that we live in now and said these animals, everyone, these are all temporary, everyone's and some of them are, they're dumb as fuck. Okay, this is, this is this whole system going on here. Like you've got to recognize this system where we're attaching morals to something that's just natural everyday process of animals consuming animals.

Speaker 5:          00:58:34       And in order for you to, you must recognize you are an animal. And in order for this animal body to work at its best really achieved eat animals. You know, that's the, I mean you can live and exist as a Vegan. There's a lot of top vegan athletes like Mac Danzig. He's a high level Vegan athlete. But maybe he'd be better if he ate meat. It's possible, you know, if you listen to guys like Dave Asprey, they'd tell you the science behind, you know, eating actual animal matter and what that does to your nerves, the way your body performs. The way your body can move. I don't know if he's right. I'm too stupid. Too stupid to really know who's right. But it sounds to me like the, the, the people that are trying to be vegans. I like what I liked, what that stands for. I like what that stands for.

Speaker 5:          00:59:18       That stands for people that recognize that like fan. So I'm them doing something, I'm effecting something. I don't want to be a part of it, but if you want to live in a society, the reality is if you like, you know, we've sort of like distanced ourself from what we're doing by not having most people involved with the actual taking of the animal's life. So even though you're a part of the chain of command or the chain of evidence or the chain of matter from, from a living animal to stake you, you're not, you've got nothing connected to it. So there's a lot of people that are wearing leather. There's a lot of people that are eating cheeseburgers and they're like, I could never go hunting. And you're like, well that's kind of crazy. Yeah, that seems like, that seems like it's Kinda crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:00:01       No, I, yeah, I totally agree. Number one. And uh, I would also say, you know, what a lot of people don't realize is the industrially farmed meat, and I'll use the term farmed very loosely, but he's extremely damaging to the ecosystem and ecological sustainability, the US. But what they miss is like monocrop, like wheat, soy, corn are arguable, arguably equally or more damaging. And I think that what a, so one of the things that made me want to actually explore food more is that in the next 10 years or so, I met with a lot of really interesting people like Sam Kass, who's the private chef for the Obamas at the White House, also does a lot of food politics. And we know the chef of the White House. I, yeah, I've met him before. He says Obama like to eat a weld. The meals he told me about where fish.

Speaker 6:          01:00:52       So he would like go out and catch the fish and then bring them in and cook them in a bottle. We catch them. That's not what I was dancing. The Sam Kass who, uh, orange chicken and watermelon, you son of a son of a bitch, but something like 50% or more of the current small farm owners in the u s are set to retire in the next five to 10 years. And what that means is you have these last of the Mohicans, like small family run farms. In many cases they're going to be up for grabs, whether that turns into strip malls or is handed over to Monsanto or some big industrial food court or third, which is really the only sustainable option that I see is uh, moving from a few really big producers, too many smaller producers. Uh, otherwise there's just too much politics involved with like subsidies for corn.

Speaker 6:          01:01:43       Yeah. Things of that type. Explain to people who don't understand that because there's a weird thing going on with corn there just when you have a handful of very large industrial food producers and you have basically a sort of exchange program between let's say the, the governmental bodies that regulate food and the Monsanto's and the kind of aggressive the world. Uh, you end up in a really fucked up situation where there are certain crops that do a lot of damage that are forced into the food supply in everything that you can imagine, like corn, she'll be in everything from certain, like every condiment you use to bread that you eat because, uh, the growth of corn and distribution corn is subsidized by the u s government, which makes it possible for farmers to make money by producing excesses of corn. And if you look at, let's say the, uh, if you look at the top soil in many of the most, uh, agriculturally productive states, they've been reduced from 10, 15 feet in some cases, the less than a foot by constantly producing the same one or two crops.

Speaker 6:          01:02:56       Uh, so in any case, I think that there's, there's a, when you were saying vote with your dollars, I think it's, it's really important to realize that people are voting for the future of this country in many, many ways. Financial and otherwise, certainly from an ecological standpoint, every time they eat a meal, like you're voting three times a day for what you want in the next 10, 15 years. Uh, and it's not, I, it's not going to be reversible. Like once, like once that farmland goes away, we're kind of fucked. I mean, in a lot of ways.

Speaker 4:          01:03:27       So anyway, how did it get to that point? How did corn w people that produce corn, how did the, they influence the government to get them to give him subsidies? Was the benefit of them getting subsidies? They don't know all the historical context to be perfectly honest. What is the benefit? Like what is, how do they sell it? Like giving, well you could, they export a lot of corn as well. Know what I mean? Like how does, how does a bill like that get past? How's, how's laws like that get put in the place where they're subsidizing people for growing excess? So hard to say. I mean there's so many lobbying groups, there's so much backdoor dealing. If you look at, let's just say the labeling or non labeling of GMO food as an example, like that was a big issue in California recently. What did lose? I can get lost in the state of California. It's, which is crazy, which is crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:04:12       Uh,

Speaker 4:          01:04:14       sometimes they can word things where it's confusing as fuck. I mean ultimately I think the most direct path of making a statement is using your dollars on the right things, right? So this is a free market. People respond to money. So it's like if you can, if you can buy food whenever possible from smaller producers as opposed to bigger producers and closer producers as opposed to those really far away, uh, the healthier you will be, the better your performance will be. And ultimately the less you'll be shackled to some company that can do it every once. It's so hard for people to do that. So, and it costs a lot of money. Like, even if you want to eat organic, that shit so expensive. If you want to eat like really healthy foods, if you want to go to the supermarket and you know, go to like a whole foods or something and get like all grass fed this and it's amazing how much more expensive it is than to go into a market and you get some weird looking semi gray steak, take that pitch home. You know, it's, it can be expensive. There are a ways out there for people to make tactical choices for health at least about which produce to spend more money on like their, their, their annual lists. For instance, the clean 15, the dirty dozen

Speaker 6:          01:05:18       and what all that means is there are the dirty dozen are the 12 most contaminated, uh, produce items, vegetables and fruits that exists on the market in the US and they're stuck there. They're studied every year and chemical analysis is done and those are the, those are the, the fruits and veggies that you'll want to get organically if you can afford it. The clean 15 on the other hand, are foods that even when produced conventionally with pesticides, antibiotics, et Cetera, have the lowest levels of contamination. So those you can actually feel pretty safe buying at lower prices conventionally. Um, and a good way for people to tell if you're getting screwed by your local grocer or not, or tricked is a on most fruits and vegetables, you'll find a label or sticker, right? If it starts with nine, it's probably organic. If it isn't, if that number doesn't start with a nine and then you might be getting beaten, switched if they say it's organic.

Speaker 6:          01:06:10       So really there, what are the, what is the standard for organic? What does exactly organic does that mean to science? What does it mean? It's a very, so this is a label that's been very abused. Uh, my loads are organic. They're a hundred percent donkeys, seaman, organic, chatty. When you're broadcasting over there on your channels, while you freak, uh, organic is, it means a lot of things to a lot of people been in general. It's supposed to mean without or as it's intended by a lot of people without additional pesticides, antibiotics, et Cetera, as it would have been grown 102 hundred years ago. But, uh, it's a, it's a, it's a battle for dollars. So a lot of these labels, if they're not regulated, get misused. And what is the feasibility of like, say if you had a community of people, say if you got together with a 10, 20 people, whatever, and you, you all wanted to get in on some farm land and figure out how to grow your own vegetables.

Speaker 6:          01:07:10       Have you like ever thought about like how much land it takes, how many animals you need, how many looked at it super closely. Is that in the book? It's a, I talk about a lot of the, the survivalist and self-reliant stuff. I don't talk about like homestead homesteading or animal husbandry as much. Um, I pretty much talks about a weird way to put it. Homesteading and animal husbandry. That's my next book. Those are two strange terms that you very rarely hear people use. No. So I looked at this really close to it in my, uh, my girlfriend actually, she's from Vancouver, Victoria and her family has created in the last year of farm that produces almost all of their foods. So they have a handful of sheep. They have a garden that's probably 150 by 150 feet and nothing produces so much vegetation. They have to give it away like, and that's a family of four plus two dogs, one 50 by one 50 feet and signing off.

Speaker 6:          01:08:04       It feels like it may be maybe 200 by 200, but it is a very manageable amount of acreage and it produces an astonishing amount of food. Now you have to know what you're doing from a gardening standpoint. I think raising animals and a lot of ways it's a hundred times simpler than keeping track of like 20 species and keeping them alive of clients of plants, they have more, they had more, they use greenhouses. They did have a greenhouse for certain plants, like tomatoes for instance, but outside just like these huge stalks of Kale, like four or five feet tall. It amazing. I mean it's just, it was so true. It was the, it was trippy for me in the same way that going on my hunt was trippy where you're like, wow, huh. So that's what a, you know, a Ribeye that's the part of the body that are revise from a in the same way, just seeing, you know, Kale for the first time growing out of the ground or asparagus or whatever.

Speaker 6:          01:08:57       It was really wild. How much effort would it take to do that for like a family? Like to run like it, to grow enough food and to have it like it's, it's, that's an interesting thing to think about. How much land do you need? How much water do you need? You know, how much, how much acreage do you need for four people? Five people can need much. I mean, my uncle had a farm. I have two uncles who had a one very small farm, another with a much larger farm. And uh, I mean if you have, you want chickens for protein and not for the meat, for the eggs because they give out eggs every day. Just kicked those eggs out. You know, I didn't even know that till I was in my thirties. I'm so fucking stupid. I thought that a, every time a chicken gave an egg that it could have been a baby chickie who could have grown to be a baby.

Speaker 6:          01:09:43       Chicky but you ate it before it could. That's what I really thought. I thought like when you had fried eggs, the, you were having baby chickies that just, you caught him in time and you killed them before they became little. But that's not what an egg is. Folks. Chickens lay eggs every day. Yeah. The ones that we make at least, I don't know if it's normal in the wild for them to run. They still, they still do. There's a lot of eggs. I mean, they're not like Franken chickens where they're like, breast meat is so big, they can't stand up. Right. Like the freak ones that you see like in those weird documentaries that scare the shit out of here. Yeah. There's a great, uh, there was, uh, there was a great TV show or series in the UK, I think it was BBC produced called, I think it was escaped to river cottage.

Speaker 6:          01:10:22       And it was about a chef from London who decided to go to the country and basically try to do all this stuff from ground zero. So raising animals, raising all of his food on this property. And it goes, you remember the guy's name? Uh, should know this. He wrote the river cottage cookbook and as well as a river cottage meet book, which is the same guy that bought Dane had on his show, got longish hair glasses. Maybe, uh, you know, the show's over now. He's got a new one on CNN now. Oh, really? Yeah, they moved it over to CNN. That's what, uh, the, uh, one of the guys, Moe, who's the director of a meat eater is also one of the guys who works for a port Dane. He works for both. That's right. That's right. 0.0. Yeah. So I remember it's Hugh fairly weddings hall, some very British sounding aristocratic name that's very British. So clearly winning his hall, something like that. But the show is awesome and it goes through a lot of this stuff. Shows

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       him fucking it up and getting it right, which is really cool. Yeah. I would imagine it would take some effort and planning for sure. Yeah. But I mean, Brian Cowen and I who, uh, Walsall went on the hunt with me, with Steve Rinella. We've talked many times about getting a plot of land for our family and like figuring out how to do something like that. It will require a lot of work though. I eat. It would, and it's probably a good idea. Part of what I thought about when I was, uh, you know, doing all this research over the last fuck two years since we last saw each other, whatever is creating a, a, a small group of like modern hunter gatherers. So you have five friends and instead of trying to do it all yourself, you're like, all right, you're in charge of Caribou. Go get us some Caribou.

Speaker 4:          01:11:56       You're in charge of fucking tomatoes, tomato guy. Make sure you get the tomatoes you're in charge of. Who the fuck knows Kombucha you made, that would be a great thing to make. Uh, uh, isn't it crazy though that that might be a rat reality some day? It's impossible for people to imagine anything bigger than sandy or Katrina. Katrina was bigger than Sandy. Yeah, but something along those lines. So a massive disaster. Massive loss of property and life. But that's nothing compared to like what used to be here. Just the ice that used to be over North America just to, you know, some guy we're in Canada and he was talking about how they found beaver can just brought it up. Someone was talking about growth, global warming and he was saying how they found beaver dense like a under hundreds of feet of ice in Greenland and that at one point in time that I saw wasn't there.

Speaker 4:          01:12:48       You know, this is like real simples real recent. Some shit happened and we cling to the idea of staying in a spot. We claim to the idea, this is my land. I've sticked to claim. Well I have a property line. I even have a fence up. But that's ridiculous because this earth is a constantly shifting organism. You know, it's a, it's a thing and it moves around and things change. The atmosphere changes. Yeah. They used to be dinosaurs here. Stupid Shit. That shit is a Volvo volatile, you know, and we don't want to believe that. We want to believe that, oh, I shut my little cardboard door and the co La Loche my little brass lock and I'm in, I am completely shut off from the environment. You know, it's just having, fuck, I mean people like spend three hours on a Saturday, spend a few hundred bucks, go get, go to Costco because they have all this disaster preparedness stuff and get two weeks of food, get like a week or two a water. Just have it. What's the downside? It's definitely not a bad thing to have. It's definitely not a bad thing to be prepared. Um, if you could do solar power, I, I definitely want to try to do that. And a lot of people go with, um, uh, they have, um, they have both. They have like a generator or they'll have like solar power. They have propane, you can have like propane generators that will kick on

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       that we'll kick on automatically when your power goes out. I had that in Colorado because when I was living in the mountains, apparently the power, the power goes out up there all the time and sometimes it takes a long time for them to turn it back on. So as soon as the power would go on, you would hear like a second and then you hear the generator kick on is a big ass generator that was set up for this property. But I'm windmills. That's another option. I have my friend and Oregon has windmills and he actually sells power back to the grid. However, the fuck that works. How does that work?

Speaker 6:          01:14:41       Uh, well yeah, I mean they will meet her, goes the opposite way. That's crazy. They don't get you a credit. That's what, uh, that's what some actually many schools in California and elsewhere are doing to generate extra revenue. Is there actually, uh, having solar power companies that are partnered with, whether it's different power companies that were local government will install solar panels on the top of all the gymnasiums and all the school buildings and everything like that. And then they will receive either an upfront payment or some type of monthly stipend or they get a percentage of the energy that is paid that is then sold back to the grid basically. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:15:20       Yeah. There was a school, uh, in boulder that had like a whole farm set up there. It was pretty bad ass kids were growing their own food at school. I was like, yeah, that, that'd be a really smart thing to teach kids how to do, you know, instead you're teaching them some shit there. Almost likely to never use yeah. You know, teach them how to actually grow some food. That would be a great thing to teach. Like as a standard class in high school farming to search simple farming. This is, hey, grow vegetables. That's why isn't that like a or a requirement? Math is acquiring English as a requirement. We were like, listen, we've got the natural world lockdown. Okay, we don't have to think about that anymore. But that, that law, that lost connection, you really do feel this, uh, this connection. When you grow something, when you actually grow something and then eat it, it's like it awakened something inside you. This weird primal satisfaction. And also just the,

Speaker 6:          01:16:12       the therapeutic aspect of having to care for something besides yourself I think is really, I certainly underestimated it. I mean, I kill plants. Like it's my job. I just, I, I have a brown thumb or I don't pay attention. Oh care, whatever it is. But I, I ended up experimenting again with growing plants and I just got rosemary, it's a really tough planet, pretty hard to kill and you can use it for just about any type of food. So I started with just a little rosemary plant, like cut to kind of look like a fucking Christmas tree that I got a whole foods or something. And that thing will produce enough herbs, enough herbs for tea and herbs for food for like weeks and weeks on end. And it's hard to kill. So I thought, I found that to be a really low stakes way to have an early success with growing a plant that would hopefully then encourage you to do more of it because it sucks when you try to get into something like that and then immediately fail because everything dies and you're like, ah, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:17:06       don't want to jump right into the deep end of pool and learn how to grow a plant. Right. For thinking about starting a farm. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Geez. If you have like your everyday life and then on the side, do you want to run a farm? Like, bitch, you ain't got time for that. You get the full, the full timers have enough trouble with that, like, yeah, I mean you would, you would have to, if you were going to feed yourself completely with the animals in the food, that would require a tremendous amount of work. You know, the, the people that sell vegetables and actually run a farmer at dairy farm or something along those lines, that's an incredible amount of work. People who actually know folks that actually have a family farm. That's an incredible amount of work that's even more. But to just to feed yourself and your family, it's going to require several hours every day, many hours every day. Taking care of the animals, feeding them, cleaning up animals. Definitely. Yeah. Dealing with, you know, setting up whatever the fuck you have around your vegetables with its fences that are keeping your irrigation going and keeping him watering, gone, dealing with fucking pestos little fucking things that start eating your food.

Speaker 6:          01:18:15       You can, uh, you can actually purchase a pretty cool, uh, think they're, think they're hydroponic. I might be using the wrong word hanging gardens. So they have these plastic containers that hold the various plants and it actually hangs down the side of a door, almost like a shoe holder. And then there's an automated water system, uh, that you can time so you can leave and go away for a day or two. And it just grows these plants effectively vertically, which is super, super cool. And then they get to a certain size. You have to plant them, get to a certain size and you can eat them. Really, you don't even need to plant them. That's super cool. Do they run on a power like we're going to power is, yeah. You would plug in. If you have the time than automated watering system, then you'd plug it in.

Speaker 6:          01:18:58       See, that seems to me like it's at least slightly defeating the whole purpose of the whole thing. If you need the fucking electricity to be on. All right. Yeah. Think this is more for the aesthetic of having plants on your door. Yeah. Well it's pretty dope if you power on, but if you don't keep the power and then all that means is you have to water the plants, which means you better have some goddamn water. If, uh, if your water system, if you, if your municipal water goes out, no shit man. You have to have it like a well system or just go by, I mean, for instance, in the basement of my apartment right now I have, I don't know what it was like 40 gallons of water. Don't tell people do. They'll come look and I five guns. Shoot, shoot him for your water.

Speaker 6:          01:19:37       Wow. Tim Fellows, first murder starts to guy. I have like seven of those arrowhead water thing. If people, if after three days of no water, people will start looking for water. Oh yeah. It's not like I'm saying I expect that, but here's the thing, I like target practice. I have ranges near my house. It's fun to do. Having a firearm is worst case scenario insurance in a location where a seven point or higher Richter scale earthquake is 80 plus percent probable in the next 15 years. Is that real? 80% so seven 70% plus a few years ago, and I think that has since gone up because on the ring of fire we had Japan, New Zealand, and I think the odds just improved. What's the deal with those dudes who find wells with a divining rod down? What's called, yeah, yeah, yeah. What's a divining rod then? What the Hell's that?

Speaker 6:          01:20:28       Defining Rod, I believe is where it's, you hold onto the fork of a stick that looks almost like a slingshot. So you hold onto the top of either end of the why and then you're supposed to get you supposed to get steered by the end of it. Oh, it's so dowsing is the use of a divining Rod. That's what I believe. So, yeah. And there's an also, there's another method where they have two sticks that are shaped like Ellis and they hold them in either hand upside down and then when they cross that's supposed to indicate how the fuck could that be real? I don't know. It's like that game where you played like you're with card Mani. No. Where you have your, the spirits where you're bored. So I will, I will say this much. I do think there are things like that that are not unexplainable but are yet to have been explained.

Speaker 6:          01:21:11       And uh, I say that partially because I've seen some pretty weird shit even at a lot of people don't realize this at Princeton University before. I think this ended 2000 2001, but one of the reasons I went there as an Undergrad is because they had something called the scientific anomalies laboratory. And this is where among other organizations, several branches of the military funded research into things like remote viewing, which is basically scientifically controlled clairvoyants where you have transmitter and a receiver and they use like double blind protocols to see if it is possible to report images back from one location, from one person to another. And uh, they had some. And then to validate whatever, uh, or to, to design the studies and then analyze the data. They had some of the world's top mathematicians and statisticians, uh, supervising this stuff. And Professor John J, O, h n who ran, I believe that was his name, who ran this laboratory.

Speaker 6:          01:22:13       And I went down and I was a test subject. I didn't have any x men like power, sadly, um, who supervise this, did this closing presentation when the lab was being wound down due to lack of funding. And he presented some of his findings and he basically said, if you look at the statistics, like all of this stuff has been validated, but it will never be accepted because of a, B, and c. And, um, what was really trippy about the remote viewing, right? So in the remote viewing protocol, one of them, they would have let's say three or four envelopes. The transmitter would choose one, they would leave, get into a car with the supervisors, uh, the experimenters, and then open the envelope, find gps coordinates and go to that location. And that's where they would transmit from. And what they found was for one of the locations, the drawings that came back and they were better, some people were better at receiving than others. Uh, the drawings all looked very, very similar, but they didn't resemble the gas station where people were going. And then they did research on the location and they found out that they were drawing barracks that had been there like a 120 years earlier. Whoa. Trippy. Really, really, really trippy shit. So,

Speaker 1:          01:23:25       I don't know, like say if you wanted to set up an experiment today with a remote viewing, are there experts that you would go to that are, that are the, that are the bad motherfuckers are remote viewing that you really think could replicate something scientifically like for a television show or something like that if they were under the gun?

Speaker 6:          01:23:44       That's a good question. I don't know. I think, I honestly think that these types of abilities are at some point going to be as analyzable is like shooting three pointers or looking at the top of UFC fighters and like, okay, we're going to look at the fiber composition of like a GSP and Anderson silver. I think at some point's gonna be like, oh, like Johnny's really good at remote viewing because he has the blah, blah, blah. And his like substantial. Yeah. He's got like some fucking, the th three 74 gene is turned on. Oh, of course. And so there are some people who appear to be better than this than others, but just to touch on like the weegee board and uh, uh, fucking Taro cards and all that shit. I think that there, I don't place any power in the tools themselves. I think there are people who have abilities who then use those tools to explain their abilities. It is an outlet for their abilities. Uh, I've just seen way too much weird shit, man.

Speaker 1:          01:24:42       What have you seen that's verifiable? What have you seen? Nothing. No, no, I know,

Speaker 6:          01:24:48       but like the want this to all be real verifiable stuff I would say is look at research that's been done by, I think it's Sarnoff international there bunch of defense contractors who have funded this kind of stuff. And uh, also, uh, look at the, uh, try to find stuff on the, um, scientific anomalies laboratory.

Speaker 1:          01:25:08       Should I watch the men who stare at goats? I, you know, I've wanted to see that. I haven't seen it. I would see it anyway. It sounds great. It was very face it a Cohen brothers, is it Cohen brothers? Yeah, I've heard it's very funny. Clooney, right? Yeah. Yeah, I've heard it's very funny actually. I can't believe I haven't seen it now. Now that I think about it. Um, so there's nothing that you can like no studies that you can point to that definitively have proven it, but you do you mean that it's possible or are you a believer?

Speaker 6:          01:25:34       No, no, no. I'm not operating on faith. I think that if you like

Speaker 1:          01:25:37       nice and what I meant, I mean you've seen enough that you believe enough

Speaker 6:          01:25:41       that I what I'm comfortable saying, it's not that like telekinesis exists or this exists, but there are odd phenomena that I have seen that that's how, I mean I don't think science has a limit sciences and method of thinking and a method of testing hypotheses.

Speaker 1:          01:25:59       The method of measuring and a method of measuring. I think that with some unique is you can't

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       really measure them if they don't happen again. If they're unique. Right, exactly. So they have to be good sciences replicable. Right. And I do believe that there are enough demonstrations of like measurements of metrics that should correlate like Ci, right? Like energy that's emitted from poems by people in China and shit. There've been a lot of studies like mailing stuff where they say, well the they have, I don't know what they measure, photons I, it's probably not futons heat from a distance. I don't know what it is. But like I've seen enough stuff that I think many of these anomalies that are seen as like a super powers, they're not super powers is they're manifestations of some type of biological, a variable that will be explainable at some point in time. And I'm not saying all of them exists, but like I've seen, and again this is going to sound like it's straight out of Crackville but it's stuff that I fucking scene is like I lived in China for six months, I was an exchange student there and saw this like you know Chigong master from a, and I think a lot of that's pure bullshit and just like cultish behavior, but it's particularly guy, old guy.

Speaker 6:          01:27:08       And he was sitting there in a park and he was doing his exercise and shit and he had dry leaves in between his hands and that he was just like kind of shuffling them back and forth between his hands. The weirdest, like one of the weirdest things I've ever seen was that it wasn't a con, I don't know. You mean they were like flying through the air, but they were like, she was sliding across this tabletop in the park between his hands. His hands are like 18 inches apart. And I mean, I don't have any explanation for it, but I know what I saw. So it's not like I'm a proponent, I'm not on the, you know, the, uh, our, uh, lobby or anything. It's just you find that guy and get a video of that, that seems like simple. Okay, dude. Yeah, you can get white leaf thing.

Speaker 6:          01:27:48       Well, there, there are videos of all sorts of weird shit and most of it's bs. But anyway, I, you saw a guy really do it. They believe that God can really do that with, well, I, I know what I saw. And to me, I mean, that's just that one. I know. And here's the thing, right? Like there's some really brilliant ways to con, so it's like, that could have been a con God knows that China's full cons. I mean it was like, Oh yeah, oh sure. I mean if you're in Beijing, like you'll have art students come up to you like every 10 minutes to sell you their unique pieces of artwork and they're poor and they could really bubble lights, horn. No, no, no artwork. Poor said their porn. I'm going out there selling you their porn in Beijing. Them No, no, it's good.

Speaker 6:          01:28:27       They're poor. I mean, there are tons of scams and China, so who knows. But what I would say is, you know, in the research for let's say the four hour chef, because it's kind of a book on learning. It's a book on accelerated learning, not just on food, but I met people who could memorize a shuffled deck of cards in like 43 seconds. Right? Or somebody you can learn a language like Icelandic well enough in seven days to go on TV and be interviewed. So to me, if that is within their own possibility, remember I was like training yourself to memorize 10,000 numbers. Like moving something like moving at least two in your hands is not like beyond belief. For me it's just, it's, I, I, I don't see any reason why it should be impossible. I don't know. The, you'd be able to push some energy from your hand that would make light things move back and forth.

Speaker 6:          01:29:12       Very, very sure. I mean, I don't, I haven't, again, it's like there, there's been no physiological evidence to demonstrate that is possible up to this point. But there are lots of things that seem impossible that, that, that had been certainly observed. Whether it's through looking at, uh, like theoretical physics or looking at applied physics for that matter. I mean there are plenty of things that were thought impossible that are just not. Um, so you think that it's you or, or rather you, you believe that there has been studies that have shown that people can generate certain amounts of energy with their hands. What styles there? No, no, no. I like, I'm not saying any of this stuff and measurable, Measurable. There have been studies done in China and elsewhere looking at she, so the potential measurement of cheese specifically, how would they do that? And I remember, I don't know the exact tools are using for measurement.

Speaker 6:          01:30:01       And again, I'm not saying like I am standing for, I know. No, I know what you're saying. You're saying there are people world's weird, the weirdest world and the problem in this world. I said, yeah, this is nice. I wonder what's in my way. I need some adapalene. I need some pro vigil. Um, the uh, what did I say? The weird his world. Yeah, the word is, we're weird. His world world is weird. That's what I'm saying. You're not, you're, you're not saying necessarily that you believe, you're saying that there's so much weird shit that is real, that you leave open the possibility that a guy could have some strange telekinetic control over matter for instance. I mean I'm a, you need for something to be scientifically verified with let's say statistical validity, whether it's through this number of subjects that a number of n or you just have such a magnitude of change that like the, the p value mean the probability of it being random event is less than 5%.

Speaker 6:          01:30:58       Uh, to do that you need tools for measurement. And it's naive to think that we have created all the tools for measuring all things we haven't. Right? Right. That's why, that's why for instance, people try to isolate nutrients, get themselves into trouble because they'll say, okay, Beta carotenes good for you. This is true like 15 years ago. And then people use a ton of Beta carotene. They get sick. Why? Because they're not consuming. It would naturally current cofactors that they couldn't isolate and see. You have to be science among other things is a game of measurement. So I think that as the tools get better. For instance, uh, right now I'm actually involved with and partially funding studies at a Ucla University of California at San Francisco in their neuroimaging lab where for the first time they're able to do a couple of very interesting things like take a functional Mri machine and use it in the same room at the same time as an Eeg, which is actually a really tough problem because these fucking magnets will like, you know, pull shrapnel out of your skull.

Speaker 6:          01:31:53       I mean they're really strong magnets. You have to be careful and they're, they're able now using like even retail products like the connect and whatnot to look at how you can reverse symptoms of dementia potentially. Like how do you train someone's brain to go from resembling that of a 60 year old to that of a 20 year old. And the better the tools for measurement, the more precise you can be, the more precise you can be, the more specific the protocol is that you can use and it's fucking amazing. Like there's stuff going on right now that is going to just turn things tight upside down when it comes to like training, mental performance and reversing the symptoms of of age from a cognitive standpoint. So for me it's just like God, like as, as we follow Moore's law and technology gets smaller and faster, exponentially and the certain heat issues when you get to a certain size, but the tools we're going to have for measurement five years are going to be like Ray Kurzweil land.

Speaker 5:          01:32:52       We're going to be able to isolate all cofactors involving in new nutrition, cellular development, the, the evolution of the genetics. We're going to have all of that mapped out a lot. It,

Speaker 6:          01:33:04       I mean I think the rate of progress is going to increase. How could it not really dramatically so we won't have it all figured out, but do you think we'll get to the point where we create an artificial person I think will absolutely get to the point where we get where we're able to create an artificial person that tricks most people. I think that's going to happen sooner than people expect. That's going to be so fucking weird. Yeah, I mean it's like the Turing test, right? So, and somebody could call me on this if I'm fucking it up, but I believe the Turing test was having a base effectively a chat communication between a real human and a computer and having that computer trick the human into believing that it is another human. And I think the, the more interesting Turing test is when you get an artificial humans sitting across from you who tricks you fools you into believing that it's another human. And I don't think, I mean maybe I'm in my own sort of echo chamber living in silicon valley, but just seeing how quickly things are moving and how, how quickly things are getting quicker. I just, I think I'd be surprised if we don't hit that point in five to 10 years. I'd be super surprised.

Speaker 5:          01:34:11       It's amazing when you really stop and think about what lies ahead. We are so far away from the reality that existed when I was just in high school, which is 20 years ago. It to look at the future and look at what lies 20 years ahead from now. It's almost unrecognizable. Things are gonna get so strange.

Speaker 6:          01:34:30       Yeah. Well if you think about in the movie minority report, right? So minority report was made what, like 10 years ago and like all of that technology and I think that was supposed to take place like 20 years from now or whatever it is, that stuff's going to exist. All of the screens that you can move with your hands in everything, I mean that's, that's going to be widespread in the next two years probably. Uh, and you know, yeah, that's not even, that's like that Microsoft surface thing. It's very similar to that. We're running ahead of schedule, you know, like where things are, things are running ahead of schedule and people give us a, Ray Kurzweil is, um, I'm not sure if you know who that is, but he, oh yeah, sure. All right. So people because of some of his beliefs, and I think there are few of the ice conclusions are clouded by the fact that he fears mortality and wants to bring his dad back to life, things like this. But he's a brilliant guy with an excellent track record of prediction. So when he says like, we're going to have nanobots that you swallow it and be like, we're able to diagnose all your issues and fix all these problems. I don't think he's that far off with most of it. Um, I really don't think he's that far off. Are we going to be able to make people immortal in the next 20 years and have it very conveniently coincide with his sort of expert projected median death sentence? Uh, probably not, but uh,

Speaker 5:          01:35:40       but he's sort of opening people's ideas or ah, mine's up rather to the possibility that these, there's like there's sort of an extrapolation that he has made that maybe other people would just not be qualified or have the vision to see. And when he lays it out, it really sort of changes the entire game because when it becomes a mainstream idea, like transcendent man has documentary all of a sudden, amazing, fascinating insight into him as a human being too. But it all, it that, that all of a sudden that becomes like a alive meme, you know, and that idea sort of grows, you know, because of the fact that he's talking about it on this hill. The hill accelerate it unquestionably. Unquestionably.

Speaker 6:          01:36:24       And uh, I actually saw the, uh, it was the debut of transcendent man, uh, or trends at dental, one of the two at Tribeca film festival. And Ray was literally right here. He was sitting in front of me watching it, which was pretty cool to sort of watch him watching this movie. Was it weird? Like what wasn't that weird? I'm a, uh, so I'm, well I guess starting few years ago and for a number of years was a visiting faculty member for the Finance and entrepreneurship track of Singularity University, which ray started along with Peter Diamandis, chairman of the x prize based at Ames, NASA location in mountain view, California. So I've had a chance to interact with a lot of, of, of Ray's cohorts and colleagues as well as Ram self and Peter Diamandis who's a really impressive guy in his own right and, uh, raises smart guy. I mean he's, he's,

Speaker 6:          01:37:23       I like that he doesn't back down. So I think when, when a lot of people who are very, very smart have extremely bold ideas, they sorta get brow beaten into, into curtailing their belief really well. I think that ray has, has stood up to critics so many times and gone on TV so many times despite the fact that he's, he's given, people tend to, to completely dismiss a lot of his stuff out of hand. And I just like that he is, he has so much intestinal fortitude to stick to his guns like his, his level of conviction, um, based on everything that he has seen. Uh, I think it's warranted. Number one. I just find it very add admirable that he doesn't, he doesn't hedge or try to like concede or, uh, in any way to negotiate.

Speaker 5:          01:38:14       See I'm so out of the loop and I hang out with such a bunch of Weirdos that no one that I hang out with even remotely thinks that it's crazy. You know, I hang out with this great, great chem trails and shit and left and right. So this like coming singularity is like, oh yeah, that's happened. Yeah. I mean, and

Speaker 6:          01:38:32       I'm also living, I live in San Francisco and it's sick. Yeah. And people who want to colonize Mars and shit. So it's like, it's not that out of reach for, for people that I spend time with. Uh,

Speaker 5:          01:38:45       in any case, some people don't see it. They see it differently than him. And they're also brilliant men. Like a Hugo de Garis who was in that documentary as well, who believes that he calls them our deluxe, the artificial intellect. And he doesn't think it's a rosy scenario for the human race at all. He doesn't get the I robot. Yeah. He's got that scenario going on. He thinks that some shit, you know, is going to get completely away from us and just going, I think it's, it's extremely light.

Speaker 6:          01:39:11       I mean, humans are constantly creating things that can destroy it.

Speaker 5:          01:39:17       Yeah. Everything. So who our best accomplishments are all destructive. I mean, that that would be, people would say that's really an ignorant thing to say. But I would say that the most impressive things that people have figured out how to do is to create nuclear bombs and to, uh, make the large Hadron collider, which is not, you know, not necessarily destructive thing. The large Hadron collider is not a destructive thing, but it does make microscopic black holes. You know, you, you really have to realize that, that you're, you're doing, you're creating some incredible amount of energy. Some you releasing some in amazing amount of energy to make these Adam's collide at the speed of light or just slightly under the speed of light. It's not destructive, don't get me wrong, but it's bordering on it. It's like, what are you doing? You know, you're, you're figuring out a way to fuck with Matt.

Speaker 5:          01:40:01       What's going to happen from that? I mean it's, well, it's eventually going to get to something that you can use to like make a country turn into a hole. You know, you'll just have a whole, where this one country used to be a void. Yeah. You'll have like the no matter the nothing in the never ending story. Imagine I'm going to be that first person and try to fuck a black hole. You probably already have you. Um, if you, um, if you can conceive of the idea of someone dropping an atomic bomb on a city full of people that had nothing to do with the, the conflict and really had no choice whatsoever and where they were born, which is exactly what we did in the 1940s and then Nagasaki and Hiroshima. If you can conceive of that, the next step is literally you show up where this town used to be and there's a giant black hole.

Speaker 5:          01:40:50       It just sitting there and you can't get too to it and it's just no matter and you can't see through it and just sits there and that's where the town used to be and someone just decided to erase it. That's not outside the realm of possibility. A nuclear bomb itself is fucking bananas. That idea is crazy that you could figure out a way to harness the very power of the sun itself and drop it on a city and instantly make a half a million people just disappear. The, you could do that. You can come up with the next slide, the next level shit's going to be even nuttier. And that's the forefront of our capabilities. And of course he's like distribution of information and beautiful things that have come from, you know, medical innovation and, you know, the, the scientific, uh, understanding of the world, the universe we live in. It's beautiful and it helps the growth of the human being. But at the end of the day, what we really like doing is figuring out a way to fuck things up with like extreme efficiency.

Speaker 6:          01:41:44       Yet a lot of that is the, uh, to the potential of like an accidental black swan. Like, oops, like we thought we were going to do this, but now we have a black hole over Toledo. Oh yeah. And then there's the, uh, all of the stuff behind the scenes that people don't see where there are very competent people who are very deliberately trying to destroy the thing. So you think, oh, I don't think, I mean I have friends who were on deployments to different places and they're like, oh yeah, we just got a bio like biotech terrorist with a phd from like Brand Name University in the u s and Yemen who's trying to build a dirty bomb to like explode over the Great Lakes using a blah, blah, blah. And we're just like, whoa, huck, like the number of times.

Speaker 5:          01:42:23       So do you think, do you subscribe to the idea that that's what's going on with the United States government? That's why he's trying to clamp down on, on, on personal liberties and freedoms. It's really is to protect people because there's so much shit going on that we don't know about. I would love if that was true, but there's so much shit going on that we don't know about that they have to. It's not like they want to read your email and find out who you're sending Dick Pictures to. What they want to do is make sure that no one's making a fucking dirty bomb and there's only one way to really do that is to monitor everybody's email and look for certain words. But then you're going to arrest Bryan because he'll call a girl. I'm like, I'm going to leave a dirty bomb in your mouth and then boom, next thing you know you're in jail.

Speaker 6:          01:43:01       I think there's a fine line between the two. I mean, I think that once you sort of set the juggernaut and motion for like constant surveillance and warrant free wire tapping and whatnot, that yeah, it's a fun, I think it's very hard to have to not have the, to go lockstep, uh, hand in hand.

Speaker 5:          01:43:22       The other issue is human beings, whenever they have power over other human beings, they abuse it. You could go back to the Sanford prison studies that they did where they were trying to, Stanford was they got as students to pretend to be jail house guards and prisoners and they had a stop. The experiments really quickly because people are all immediately started abusing each other and that was supposed to go on

Speaker 6:          01:43:44       for something like a week or two weeks. I cancelled it I think after 48 hours

Speaker 5:          01:43:48       and you're in the problem. One of the big with the idea of warrantless surveillance is that you're allowing people that are just regular folks to decide whether or not they should spy on people and whether or not they should take their information or whether or not they should fuck with their lives. You're regular foot, you have no evidence whatsoever. They are enlightened, no evidence whatsoever. They're operating on a higher frequency. We'll all with the good of mankind. There's no evidence whatsoever that government people are any different than regular people and regular people are fucking crazy. Regular people are on antidepressants taking sleeping pills and drinking every weekend and they're doing drugs and they're all fucked up in the head and who knows on what Ssri is there on. That's everybody. That's a huge percentage of our population, including people in government and we've seen with his general Patraeus thing, okay.

Speaker 5:          01:44:44       That the people at the highest level of government, the guy who's the head of the fucking CNA still can't keep his pitches in check. He's still got regular people problems. The guy's still got like affairs. He's still got, you know, this hot woman who's married and this is going on a site and these people, that's the CIA, they're allowed what an I were ironically enough. What I think is fascinating about this is this must allow the people at the highest levels of government to understand how dangerous it says because the whole thing came about. Like his exposure came about because the FBI was investigating the CIA, FBI and a CIA don't like each other. All it's so, I didn't know that. Did you know that? Did you ever think that the FBI and the CIA didn't like each other? No. I have a friend who explained to me that the navy seals and the marines do not like

Speaker 6:          01:45:34       each other. There's a lot of infighting. That shit is ridiculous. Ton of infighting and you know what? What mildly don't like each other or like want to kick each other's asses. Well, the, yeah, maybe, maybe it's, that's an unfair question to ask cause you generalizing and lumping everybody into one group. But I mean if you look at let's say the Pfizer Bill, which Obama passed a couple of years ago, which effectively allows warrantless wiretapping uh, the response that people have, which I understand in which was the response I had for a long time is I don't have anything to hide if it keeps everyone safer, go for it. Right. The problem with that is when you have people in power like to stay in power, obviously enough, when you have that type of warrantless wiretapping, who do you think are going to be the first people who get wired that every member of Congress. Sure. How all your opposition, how many people have, so what percentage of congressman or congresswoman have dirty laundry? 100% everybody has fucking dirty laundry. I mean it's easy enough to, you know, especially the old school people that have been around long a long

Speaker 5:          01:46:40       time. They were, they were rocking it like pre-internet, you know, if you want, you know, like Teddy Kennedy, like you want to go to like to his past like that, you know the, those guys like that, the fucking Newt Gingrich's of the world, that they rocked it that way long before the distribution of information. So now that all this stuff is out and everybody's tapping everything like, whoa. Yeah. You see with the portrayal scandal clearly mapped out the problem with this whole situation because there is fucking no reason this should be news. There's no reason this should be investigated by anybody that's in any organization that's trying to stop crime because there was no crime being committed other than I guess morals violations by the guy who supposed to be exemplary of the military, his highest honors. Yeah. I guess you can look at it that way, but the reality is there's no, no one's in danger.

Speaker 5:          01:47:32       Like why are you wasting resources on his fucking national enquirer shit. Yeah. And the attitude you go about doing it well, it's all so obvious. Like, you can't allow people to just check shit out because the woman, she was just like some crazy bitch that's like this socialite flirts with guys. And then there's this other one who's the author whose email and that girl saying, get away from my man. And she calls the FBI says, this bitch is threatening me. She turned the FBI honor. And then they're like, why is this? What's going on here? And then the guy who's investigating it sends shirtless pictures of himself to the chick. So then they stopped the investigation. They go, what the fuck are you doing? You can't send to, so they investigate him and find out that he's doing creepy shit while he's investigating. Portray us and this girl, oh my God, it's so clear.

Speaker 5:          01:48:24       Just that as a map should be stop, stop looking in each other's fucking emails. Jesus Christ, you women, the FBI shouldn't be a bunch of fucking women. The FBI should be one of the most distinguished group of people in the position of power in this fucking country. You're not supposed to be investigating who's blowing who. That's ridiculous. There's shit to be done. Yeah, we're in two wars. You fucks. You can't send shirtless pictures of yourself just chilling at the barbecue. Thinking about our case, flexing your six pack. You fucking asshole. We're sick. We're a God damn sick nation. What we need is legalized prostitution and no more snooping. Those are two things we need to calm everybody the fuck down those those gentlemen in this position of power clearly need some sort of an extracurricular release. Yeah. I'm not saying everybody needs it. I'm not saying I'm, I'm happy, I'm good, but what I'm saying is you need to figure out a way to calm these motherfuckers down.

Speaker 5:          01:49:23       Yeah, and that's the only one that makes sense. Stop reading their emails and let them get blowjobs. We're trying to fucking keep the country safe. Yeah, I think that's it. I think that's a pretty good concession. You can't just go digging into people's shit like that. These guys are portraying is 60 fucking years old. That means for 40 whatever it was years he operated with. No, he lived his life without a fucking whisper of the Internet. And he lived his life as a fucking guy who's a professional killer. Okay. And all of a sudden introduce the internet, this guy's life and to start snooping on his email. I think that's rude. Yeah, I think it's not fair. Those fucking guys, they better stop this gear. Stop this NSA thing that they're trying to do when they're trying to make a database of every phone call you've ever made, every email you ever take, every text message you ever make, they're building some crazy facility in Utah where they can just record everything that gets done.

Speaker 5:          01:50:24       Well, just in case they need to investigate Tim Ferriss, he's making terrorist threats against the president. Let's see what he's been doing online. He doesn't even build, the scarier thing is he's not making terrorist threats, but like Tim Ferriss propagating a message that the, that the, uh, the powers that be disagree with, I mean you get to like a West Berlin point pretty fucking quickly. Exactly. And you know, and people that think that's impossible because America doesn't stay. That's not, you're not dealing with America. You're dealing with people. Yeah, exactly. America is just an idea and I love America. I love the idea, but I just don't trust people to be in a position of power and neither did the people that fucking founded this country. That was the whole point, the whole point. And we have slipped away from that to the point where now we operate under this semi democratic situation where you kind of have a say, but not really.

Speaker 5:          01:51:13       Yeah, that's not cool. We're all adults. That's not cool. You don't have to do it that way. There's really good a movie I'm going to spell. I'm going to fuck up the name. I think it's other people or other people's lives about West Berlin and there's surveillance done in west Berlin. It's a Ooh fucking great movie. It's fascinating. But if people look back to, not to dwell on this point, but it's like people should keep that potential in mind. It's not that long ago that we had McCarthyism. Right? And if you want to put McCarthyism on steroids, like have every phone call, every email that anyone has ever sent. Um, my Lord, I used to think that, that we, we learn, but I think we learn and then we forget and then we have to learn again. I think we have these like cycles. It's like the, the coming and going of the tides.

Speaker 5:          01:52:02       I, cause when I was a kid, I remember that the Vietnam War ended when I was, I think it was like seven or eight or something like that. And I remember it because I remember very clearly thing, I was really terrified of the idea of war because, uh, my, my stepfather had avoided the draft. He got lucky. He didn't get drafted, but we knew people that did. And it was really scary that these people would go and they would have to go someplace where they might get shot and nobody wanted to do it. And everybody seemed to not believe in it, but yet it was still going on. So when that war was over, I had this real tangible sense of, okay, we figured out that that sucks. That's, we're not doing that anymore. Like that is, we figured out that war is a terrible thing.

Speaker 5:          01:52:43       It's unnecessary now that the war is over, we can relax. And that was the case all through my life through high school and into my early, I guess I was maybe 21 when the first Gulf War happened and I was living with my friend Jimmy did Telia. We're living in Waltham, Massachusetts, and we're sitting in the middle of the living room watching the shit on TV because it was the first time they would show you these like night vision shots of these rockets flying through the air in this Eerie Green Hue and you've seen all these explosions and he just looks at me, goes, well buddy, looks like we're at war. That Boston accent. I was like, Holy Shit. Like we were back to this. Yeah. That one went nice and quick and then post September 11th it's like the entire lessons of generations that had to go through World War II, Korea, Vietnam, those lessons were that whatever the society learned from that, at least elusive was temporary last temporarily temporarily.

Speaker 5:          01:53:44       We lost our fucking minds and now people are starting to starting to come around to it again and I'm hoping that the evolution that we make from this version of it will be more lasting because of the freedom of information rather than the the free ability to distribute information with the Internet that we can get it out a little bit easier this time and then we could say, listen ladies, gentlemen, we're not saying we don't need government. We certainly do. We're not saying people shouldn't have laws that they abide by. They certainly should. We should have a nice peaceful, not saying you shouldn't make profit. You certainly should. What we're saying is you can't get crazy. You can't go nutty and not look at humans and not look at the human race as the most important thing. Instead consonant training on money, concentrating on, you know, the extraction of resources from strange parts of the land that people aren't really paying attention to because it's not close by. So it's okay to kill people with robots that fly in the air. You know, all of that is bananas and it doesn't mean we can't keep a nice order in the world. We can but we can't get too fucking crazy. Yeah. And I'm, I'm hoping that, I don't know if you agree with this, but that there's a, uh, a sort of a wrestling match going on between the idea of an apocalyptic scenario that's human created and the idea of technology and understanding meeting somewhere in the middle and working it out.

Speaker 6:          01:55:06       Yeah. No, I think that you have technology that's, I would like to thank, you know, human sort of self interested rationality, but I don't know, you have the technology to solve problems which is developing really quickly. And then you also have problems that are compounding, right? Just like money in a bank account. You have these problems compounding, whether it's climate change, populate, explosive population growth in certain areas. And so it is a bit of a, it's, it's a race in a sense. Um, and I, I don't know which side is going to come out in front. I mean, I'm very, very curious about population growth and how that population density and global travel and how that compounds the impact of something like avian flu or SARS or whatever. And it's like, at what point do we reach a population density where it is like the deer jumping in front of your car, where you just have such a high density of people that the inevitability of a disease and rapid spread globally through air travel effectively just wipes out.

Speaker 4:          01:56:18       It isn't that the sort of the natural cycle of things is that when there's an overpopulation is correction, there's a correction. God, it fucking terrifying to think of the plague as a correction, you know, wild.

Speaker 6:          01:56:31       Uh, in any case, I mean, so I'm actually probably going to be getting a little bit of land in,

Speaker 4:          01:56:37       uh, you tell him, tell people Tim Ferriss to come into your house. Brian and I have been talking about Columbus. His mom's got a compound. We're gonna move in with Mrs Red Band. I actually ended up visiting a couple of, uh, from the last book, um, for our body. Had a number of hedge fund managers who were, who basically want to be the guy from limitless a pro. We got to talk about this. I gotta take a Piss talk to Brian. He's really all about limitless. I will talk to Brian about limitless and then I will piss off. It also

Speaker 6:          01:57:06       had like a gallon of water together boys. We could do that. Why, why is your were we were talking about this earlier, a what you're, your book is banned from bookstores. Yeah. What's the, what's, what's going on with that? So the four hour, the four hour chef is the first major book out of Amazon publishing as Amazon, about a year and a half ago announced the launch of Amazon publishing in New York City, which would be competing against all of the major publishers to recruit authors. Right. Uh, and that's really making everyone in the book industry extremely uncomfortable because Amazon super ambitious and hyper, hyper confident and competent also. So the book is being banned as a result. The first time I'm aware of that, a book had been banned by all of Barnes and noble, tons of tons of indies. Uh, so they even matter anymore because to me, I barely even see bookstores anymore.

Speaker 6:          01:58:07       I mean, no, I'll tell you what the, I think the play is. Um, so there, what they want to do is kill Amazon publishing so that they aren't able to recruit good authors. And so they want to make an example out of me as this guy who's had two to number one New York Times best is very fortunately they want to say they want to basically crippled me. So I don't hit the New York Times list and then point to that. And in effect, say if that guy can't do it with Amazon publishing, don't sign with on publishing. And uh, oh, is this, you're talking about you're being banned from Ben wanted to bring that up? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's the most, uh, band boycotted, whichever were 1100 bookstores more than that now. So yeah, in the airport, even the airport bookstores or is that he's nothing.

Speaker 6:          01:58:56       No, the airport bookstores are are interesting. Those are basically, not always, but effectively pay for play, so that's like buying advertising almost. You pay for placement with a lot of people. Fail to realize is let's say at a Barnes and noble, it's just like a Walmart like you have. Coca Cola owns the first 20 feet of Walmart, like they legitimately pay for that space. Similarly, if you walk into Barnes and noble and you see like the the whatever, whatever rack or the the new note note worthy or whatever, the store owners have some decision over that, but a lot of it is paid op advertiser. That's why it's so hard. If you're a self published to get books into Barnes and all works, they're like, you know what are you going to pass for an end cap that's not free. They also have to stay open.

Speaker 6:          01:59:37       Man. Barnes and nobles closed lefts and rights. Hard to get people to buy books these days. I always said that if you want to really starve to death, open a bookstore in Miami, you know, it's hard. It's hard. It's tough. It's a tough business. And either, I think that what, uh, I'm curious to see what happens. So they've banned you. Yeah, I'm out zero. And actually if he was like discussion, no. Well, what's, what's really funny about the whole situation? There are a lot of things that are amusing to me about it, but they, at first they said, well, we're not going to carry Amazon published books because you're not on the hook. Like you won't let us put like the four hour chef on that does look bad. I have a nook. No, it looks not bad. No. What I'm saying is they were saying, hey, Amazon, you're not letting us put these books on the Nook so we're not gonna, we're not going to carry you in the stores.

Speaker 6:          02:00:23       And then Amazon came back and they're like, okay, fine. Put It on the neck and principles. Like I always still don't like you. And so they, uh, yeah, they're not. Yeah, they're not carrying it. In fact, some of the Barnes and noble store owners wanted to carry this book and they got severe slapped down from corporate because corporate got word that they were ordering copies of the book and they just gave them the iron fist. Have you thought about organizing an email campaign or something against Barnes and nobles? Unfair practicing. I said unfair. I think it's unfair. Yeah, it's deep feelings. I feel like you know who it's unfair to and this is the children, the children, the poor refugees. No, it's, it's an, it's unfair to their customers and ultimately this is where I think they're, they're, they're missing the mark. Number one is if even if Amazon publishing fails, that will not stop the move from print to digital.

Speaker 6:          02:01:16       That will not stop that trend. It will not. It will not even register. Secondly is Vic only competition is for loyal customers and bookstores. Certainly more than ever need loyal customers. If someone comes until it's at Barnes and noble, browses around and then goes home to buy the book on Amazon for price, that person was never a customer to begin with. If, on the other hand somebody walks into Barnes and noble and says, I really want to buy copy, I want to buy three copies of the four hour chef for, you know, as Christmas presents and for myself, and then they kick it. It all that accomplishes is there driving that loyal customer to Amazon to become a customer of there. So I don't, I don't quite understand the logic I, but again it's, it's humans are emotional, right? That's why it's, it's so concerning among other reasons about all the stuff we were talking about.

Speaker 6:          02:02:02       So I'm not sure if it's a completely rational decision. Amazon's a big scary company to go to a lot of book sellers, but I think that for instance, the only way to keep print relevant for, for the foreseeable, let's say 10 15 years, is to create a tactile experience like works of art through publishers like Faden, p, h, a I, d, d o, and they make beautiful books that that is next to impossible to replicate on digital or to have a very unique experience in a relationship with your customers, like omnivore books in San Francisco, which is all cookbooks. It's all they sell. He's like, you want to know anything about cookbooks by something at a print, get a recommendation, meet one of the top chefs in the world. That's where you go. Really? That's a specialized sort of corner store. It's cool. Yeah. There's one called, uh, I think it's Slotnick, Slo, t n, I, C K cookbooks in New York City.

Speaker 6:          02:02:54       Same Story. It's like the Mecca of cookbooks and you want to know something about that. That's where you go. And those businesses will continue to thrive. But it's like if you're competing against digital for price and convenience, it's going to be a pretty tough road. And uh, but there are ways to counter it. So I mean the only reason if I wanted to just make more off of the book, I would have stayed with other publishers quite frankly. Um, but Amazon was interesting because I want to try new things and I want to be allowed to try new things. Like I'm doing a partner, a content partnership with bit torrent. I'm putting out like tons and tons. I probably well over a gig of free material and videos and all this shit on bit torrent because they have 160 million users and that's the kind of thing that Amazon will let me do.

Speaker 6:          02:03:37       Whereas others may not be so keen to let me. The other thing that people are talking about the distribution, the distribution and they're like, oh well what's Amazon going to do with first thing, no publisher out there. I don't think any publisher except for Amazon in my case would let me do a 672 full color book with thousands of photos. That is a fucking expensive book to make. I don't think anyone else would have, let me do it. Why is that? I understand. Because the margin suck. It's a really, really tremendously expensive book. And you just, the way the photographs, the print that it has to be on. Yeah, exactly. Like to create a really physical book, a really beautiful physical book, like a tactile experience. There just aren't many publishers will do that anymore. And, uh, so, uh, you know, distribution aside, if you, what's, what's really p seven assets, um, what makes Amazon interesting from the standpoint of a content creator is that if you look at almost any other publisher, Simon and Schuster, whoever, it doesn't matter, they do not have any direct connection

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       to their readers. They sell to the head buyer in a category of Barnes and noble. They sell to the head buyer category at books, a million in the middle of the country. Uh, but whereas Amazon, I mean I use Amazon prime. Amazon probably knows me better than I know myself and a lot of ways like they have such direct access to tens of millions of customers. It just makes it really attractive as an experiment. Whether it'll turn out like who the fuck knows? Well no at the end of next week, but that's a really interesting scenario. The Amazon has a couple of good things going for it. Besides the fact that people already know it as a great place to buy things with one click and buy books. They have this new thing that they're doing with audible, which is one of the sponsors of this show. Oh look, we're doing whisper sync.

Speaker 4:          02:05:27       Yeah. This is the fucking coolest thing. Would whisper. See I was going to save it for the commercial, the next audible commercial, which is this week. But what whisper sync is essentially is you read a book and say if you fall asleep where wherever that it pages, you can have it on your smart phone where you get in your car, you plug it in, you have an app that plays through your audio Jack and it picks up where you left off and starts reading the book to you while you're in traffic. Yeah, exactly. We'll go from text to voice. It's fucking beautiful. It's really amazing. He said going from tax to an actor's voice, right. So it'll sink. Like if you're reading a book in bed and then you get in your car to go to working and you have the audio book version, then you'll pick up where you left off reading it.

Speaker 4:          02:06:12       So do you have to sync it from your, um, cure your kindle to it? Does it as long as you're connected to Wifi or three g it syncs automatically and it syncs to your phone and your phone knows what Scott, what's up in the car, whatever that's predicted. The government's got to know, got to know what page of 50 shades of grey exactly. Hawes and masturbated on who is, it's it, um, it's so it's actors, a reader or as a computer that reads it. Do you know that? Uh, I built, my understanding is that it syncs with the point in the book that Oh, they have this act to come to hand. Ian Audio, audio book. You buy an audio book on audible and then because it's owned by Amazon and then you're reading on your kindle, let's say the next chapter, you get in your car to listen to it and it will continue where you left off in the book reading.

Speaker 4:          02:07:00       It's pretty credible. That's wild. Yeah. Here's the answer. It's a, it's a, it's only on the kindle fire HD and the kindle fire. That's two of them. The 8.9 inches, the seven inch, the second generation ones, they, um, it's a professionally narrated audio book. Amazing. Yeah. It's pretty cool. Yeah. That might actually get people to start like reading books for and learning some shit. Yeah. That's, that's, that's the future. But it sucks that Barnes and noble a is trying to keep you out. Yeah. I mean, they really need me to fail, so if I succeed next week, they're going to have a big world to trouble. So silly. Just sell the fucking, yeah. I don't see, be in bullies. Yeah. I mean they're, they're really being bullies. It, another thing is the, I mean, I've had the prior, the prior two books, very stupid. They're picking the wrong guy to make an example of, yeah. Like your your books or New York Times bestseller, number one, New York Times best sellers socket, Amazon or Barnes and noble talking to Amazon to suck. I'll suck Amazon for you. Suck Barnes and noble. Come on. Barnes and noble. Get it together. That's ridiculous.

Speaker 6:          02:08:03       It's silly. So, uh, yeah, it's going to be a dog fight though. So we got some, I could actually give you a give you a scoop on some stuff that's happening next week. But so for instance, uh, nobody knows this yet. Oh, I know. Yeah, yeah. No. This Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo. Get new sound. Yeah. So do you really? Yeah. You have a breaking news. So ready? Go. Uh, I have to find it. Oh, come on.

Speaker 4:          02:08:26       Semi break. This was one of those fucking morning zoos that's not Britain. Oh, that was good. Definitely good. Damn good. That was worth the wait.

Speaker 6:          02:08:37       Uh, so you know, what do you do when you get banned by bookstores while you open your own bookstores is what you do. So I am actually going to be taking an outlet. I'm partnering with a Panera Bread. Oh Wow. Which a lot of people don't realize. Pinera has like what, 2000 locations in the u s and I was doing a pilot starting, uh, what's tomorrow? Monday. Tomorrow in New York City, people will be able to buy the four hour chef at retail at all of the pioneer look, the four main penny or locations in New York City.

Speaker 4:          02:09:03       Interesting. So like how Starbucks sell cds now. Exactly. And that's a, that's a new thing.

Speaker 6:          02:09:09       Dang man, I think that's the way to go. That's a perfect place. Starbucks and Panera bread. Yeah, and they're also going to be at the same time piloting. So Panera, right? Bread Pan Pawn, right? They're going to be piloting a slow carb diet, hidden menu, which is from like the four hour body stuff. So if you want to actually effectively eat paleo or eat slow carbon loose fat, now you can go to this place that's known for bread and actually get a slow carb meal, which is pretty cool. It's going to do both the simultaneous simultaneously.

Speaker 4:          02:09:39       That's amazing. How do you feel about like seeing now there's, there's so much awareness for the content of food now. You mean you see grass fed meat everywhere now. It's part of the vernacular now. This is what just didn't exist as five, six years ago. I think. Great

Speaker 6:          02:09:55       thing, as long as it's, the labels are policed to some extent so that assholes don't come along and start mislabeling things purposefully, which happens all the time. But I think it's a great thing. And I mean, one of the goals that, um, that I have is to sort of create a, a, a, a super trend of about 20 million people who simply think about let's say purchasing food from breakfast differently or dinner differently. And if you can create a super trend by getting roughly that number of people to change certain buying habit, then I think we, I think that this country can really it towards

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       more of this, a smaller producer, many suppliers versus, you know, monolithic industrial producers. And once you do that, I mean, once the money is there, the supply will generate itself. I mean, you'll have, it'll be commercially viable for people to do more of this grass fed stuff, which we already see coming. It's just I want to stick kind of a Archimedes lever in the whole thing and fucking blow it up, which is part of, uh, what I hope to do in the next, I don't know, 12 months or so. How much different would communities be if every neighborhood had a little mini farm? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like a shared gardener garden. And we all sort of chipped in and everybody had responsibility, Neighborhood Watch type thing, and it's not that farfetched. I mean, it's not that far fetched at all. Well, the problem with cars is that now we don't have communities anymore. Like I don't live near any of my friends. I've been trying to get everybody to move near me. That's not working. We're going to have to buy land somewhere. But I thought, how great would it be if I lived in the same.
