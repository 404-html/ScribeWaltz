Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Guys need to cut it out. Try Casting. Did you ever organize parents podcast brought to you by the flashlight? What is the fleshlight? Fleshlight is a vagina made out of rubber. That's an a thing that looks like a flashlight and John half. Ron The brilliant comedian John had fallen, had a very funny point and he said they really should make a fleshlight. That's a flashlight because you never know what your flashlight is, but you always know where your fleshlight is. You laughed. You can't help but laugh because it's funny. Hi. If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link to the flashlight and enter in the code named Rogan, you will get 15% off the number one sex toy for men. Shazamm bitches, Duncan trussell's in the house. We ready to get off free con.

Speaker 2:          00:01:02       Hi. Hi

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       Dunkin. Hi. We got everything going on here folks. We took Alpha brain pills, Alpha brain by on it, o n n I t.com. We've been selling these here on the podcast telling people about them. They sold out completely quickly and you know, there's always going to be, some people don't, don't like certain things, but the response, a positive response from these things, it's been fucking tremendous. And a, even Tim Ferriss loved it and he thought the, you know, he read the ingredients, he said they were great, said it's a perfect combination. It's, which is really nice to hear because he was fucking brilliant man. What an interesting guy. But reading his book, the four hour work, while the four hour body is the one I've been reading, it's so fucking informative. There's so much in there man, about so many different things and his own personal detailed examinations and experience.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       He's done with his own body, like gaining 30 pounds, like getting over a course of like six weeks and did all this bodybuilding stuff and all these different things where he combined foods and nutrients in different times of the day and he detailed everything and it's fucking really interesting. And one of the things that he detailed his, that his balls were getting cooked by his cell phone and it was killing his sperm count. Like he's totally healthy. It just gained all this muscle, right? He's lifting weights, doing all this kettle bells and shit figures. He's healthy as a horse. Good gets his. Is is berm checked just for whatever. I mean I'm, no, it's gonna to come back. Awesome. You know, it's was one of those things, my loads are going to be awesome. I'm going to be glowing. Well he goes and he's, his sperm is like down significantly, so the only thing he does to change it is he adds some, I believe Brazil nuts to his diet because Brazil, Brazil nuts contain certain minerals, minerals or something like that. It's supposed to be good for your sperm count and took his cell phone out of his pocket, did no longer had a cell phone on him. Apparently the studies online that show a significant correlation between having your cell phone in your pocket and low count. Can I ask

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       you why it was important to him to have a good sperm count?

Speaker 4:          00:03:03       Well, we wanted to know what was going on with his body because his whole, his whole thing is about him experimenting with his body and trying different things that people try to get optimum performance out of your body. His sperm count, the number of sperm that are live and healthy living. It's not the loads, the size of the loads could be the same. But inside those loads is just how many words a dead fucking does it. He goes ship, he'll look good, arrives like, you know, you're calm, smart boy. He's the fucking boat. Hits the beach at Normandy and every living soldiers just dead. They're just slumped over and it's terrifying. So you're so, so my loads could be filled with dad wore a good friend of mine, had a really hard time getting his girlfriend pregnant, his wife pregnant. And um, they went to a doctor and he's not even 40 and he found out that he had a really low sperm count and he's kind of freaked out about it.

Speaker 4:          00:03:58       You know, it was like, what the fuck? And He's thinking about all these different things, but one of those things could easily be your cell phone. Your cell phone is cooking your balls. Your laptop does that too. Yeah. Well that's heat though. Differences, what you're talking about heat or radiation? No, it's the signal. It's the megahertz. It's a spectrum. The radio spectrum, but cell phone during her. That's a good question. I apparently having the receiver right next to your balls is like really bad for your balls. Your balls are just battling this radiation. Now this for, I just want to say I've done no research other than read what he said so I haven't rehearsed researches online. The, it's like the brain cancer. It's switches left and right every time. You know, every time they say, oh no, cell phones give you high brain cancer, but that they say is true one day and then just treat onfi.

Speaker 4:          00:04:44       I don't think, first of all, I don't think it has to give you brain damage to be fucking you up. It could be fucking you up in subtle ways. It's very possible. It doesn't, it doesn't necessarily have to give you tumors, but if it's the potential for giving you tumors is there, what does that mean? That he'd either kills you or it does nothing to you. So either it turns your fucking head into a grapefruit and pineapple start growing off the side of your head, your brain, or it does nothing. That's ridiculous to me. To me that, that seems like we're being silly. That's a silly way of looking at health that like you, you, it has no effect on you other than maybe kills your brain, this

Speaker 3:          00:05:25       thing. And in Virginia there's a part of Virginia that is a cell phone free zone because there's some kind of radio telescopes out there and they don't want it. They want to have the purest signal and they don't want any disruptions. So there's a name for these zones. And there are these people who have been moving to this town. I can't remember the name of it. Green something. West Virginia. It's Tom. I, it's my last tweet. But they've been moving to this town, uh, because they think that they're sensitive to cell phone frequencies and they break out in rashes. And this article, it said that like the has acknowledged that this does exist, this health problem does exist, but there's no proof that it's from cell phones. But there are people who get really sick when they're in cell phone areas and you know, there, I'm sure a lot of them are kooks you know, but uh, so you know, who knows.

Speaker 4:          00:06:14       Well that's a good guess because a lot of everybody with when whenever outrageous claims come up, you've got to think a certain percentage of them are Kooks. But I don't think we've completely assessed the effects of all these wireless. Yes,

Speaker 3:          00:06:27       no. Think of that shit man. Think about the fucking megabytes of information pouring through the air at any second. It's, it's like, if all like the, the information that can create the beautiful world of Warcraft is like flying around me at every second. That can't be good for you. That's so much information just blasting out of your modem at all times. How is that not going to affect you in some way?

Speaker 4:          00:06:53       Yeah. Even if you can't process the information rationally is your brain's still tuning into it, like all these wireless signals that are in our, I mean we never think about that because really it that wireless like real full wireless like we have now with like Internet and you know, and radio signals where you're cordless phones are on certain frequency and then of course cell phones. This is really kind of recent, right? How many years has it been slowly since the 80s right?

Speaker 3:          00:07:21       Yeah, but even in this started, I don't know when Ra wireless routers started. I mean like in niche more recently. Yeah. So yeah, there were cell phones, but I bet the information that was coming through is less. It had to have been because fewer people had cell phones.

Speaker 4:          00:07:35       I remember the first, first time I got a computer that was a wireless, I was like, this is the craziest fucking thing I've ever seen in my life. I'm no where near a wire and I'm on line. That's when you really start to think how crazy the fucking internet is that this thing that I can't see can fly through the air at like ridiculous speeds and sits on my laptop and I get all the answers to anything. It's basically, this is a magic box that lets me have every answer to everything that's ever been asked that Cuban pings of answered,

Speaker 3:          00:08:05       but what, what's coming through the air? Isn't it just that is it? Is it like a sound that's telling your computer? It's a signal. It's like ones and Zeros basically certain frequency. It's like the old dial tone sound that used to dial in using a 50 60 modem but quiet.

Speaker 4:          00:08:19       I thought believed that wireless Internet was invented by Nikola Tesla too. I believe the concept of it came from his work. Is that true? You did that drunk Tesla drunken moment and if you haven't seen is folks, it is one. I retweeted it just the other day. One of my funny and one of my favorite videos and I think it's the one of the funniest videos ever because it's first of all, it's so informative. It's really interesting. A lot of people don't even know who Nikola Tesla is. He was just amazing genius. And one of my personal best examples of that, I have a lot of other, I have a lot of theories about brilliant people and a lot of the brilliant people that I've have been crazy. You know, there's, there's something there. They might not be a hundred percent crazy, you know, maybe it's only 10% grazie maybe they're hanging on with 20 or 30% crazy. But to, I almost believed to be super, super brilliant at something like Tesla was like at that level so far beyond everybody else can almost like you have to be quirks tuned out. You can't be, can't be balanced. There's no way.

Speaker 3:          00:09:19       Well remember when you were a kid and you would play, make believe with your friends and whatever that was that you did. Like, I don't know, cowboys and Indians, I play with my daughter all the time. So when you, so now imagine this, imagine that you had to play that game for the rest of your life, even though you knew you were playing with kids and you knew it was just this big kids' game. Maybe when people get super, super, super smart, they recognize that they're sort of trapped in this dimension where everybody's deeply engrossed in what amounts to a baby's game, that they all things very important. They all think it's really serious, but you recognize, oh no, this isn't even a a 1% of what exists in the world. This isn't even 1% these, these idiots are playing the game of like presidents and country and army and police officer, a married person, but it's just the game.

Speaker 3:          00:10:12       Maybe when you get really, really smart, you see that and all of a sudden you don't. Not If, if you're not really smart or if you're just one of us, you just normally play the game. You don't even think about it. You wake up, go to work. He was playing the game. But imagine if you knew this was a make believe games. So every day you woke up and you're like, well, got to go play with play this absurd silly game and you just knew it. Then you'd start doing weird shit cause it'd be hard for you to just instinctually do all the different things that everyone does. You start doing weird shit and people would be like, why? And he's kind of off, isn't he? He's a little off. He doesn't shake hands. I wonder why then shaking hands. What's shaking hands is stupid. Fuck, I don't want to slap technicals. I'm sorry. I don't feel like rubbing tentacle. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:10:57       those with you today. You don't want to touch people. You don't want to offer up your sword and I feel disrespected. You know that's what it was. You would offer up your sword hand. That's right. You couldn't, you couldn't kill each other at that moment. I'm not going to stab yet. That's not wine England. He's still driving the left hand side and then we drive on the right hand side. They drive it the left because that was how you wrote a horse and had your sword in your right hand. So some Douche bags coming in the other direction and you want to get them on your right side so he can sort his ass. Jesus Christ, they still, that's why they drive on that side of the street. I mean it makes sense because look, realistically, it was just a couple of hundred years ago and people were riding horses everywhere.

Speaker 4:          00:11:30       I'm, these were tough. That's how it works. That's not that long ago man. That's, it's amazing when you stop and think about the end, Nikola Tesla is really one of the reasons why we're so fucking advanced. If you look back at the inventions this guy was responsible for and all the patents at this guy was responsible for, it's a brilliant thing. And I don't remember at feet here in a fucking peep about him in high school. I, I, somebody told about him, uh, when I was in college and some, some, it wasn't even in a class. Some dude was a reading something about the guy and he looked interesting on the cover and I think that's how I learned about Nikola Tesla. But I mean, I obviously, I didn't take any science shirts, but I, I, I never hear about you hear about Thomas Edison. You hear about Benjamin Franklin, the people that invented a May. Oh, you've had electricity. He wouldn't have told you who the fucking keys. No, Nikola Tesla was talking to aliens, bitch. All right. That guy was inventing everything and wound up dying like completely crazy at the end. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:28       Yeah. He, well, he, yeah, he was a, I mean, I feel like I'm quoting the drunk history, but he is essentially, it was in love with a white pigeon and he was wandering around New York and, you know, and you know, New York was lit up with his technology, um, and he was just broke and it was all there because it came out of his mind. You know what, I'll give you a weird little trivia

Speaker 4:          00:12:49       money from him. Was it Edison? Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:12:51       Uh, I, well, no, it was how many die broke? He died broke because he had some bad luck. Uh, his, um, one of his main laboratories burnt down. He had basically figured out in his mind, a way to generate, I, I guess you'd consider it wireless electricity, like he had this idea that you could there rather than having to have like a, an engine, a generating the electricity that the, I don't know, reality itself for every, you know, bit of reality had compressed within it, enough energy to supply anything. There's like energy all around us. That was his idea. We're just surrounded by energy and there's a way to tap into it. And so he was way to broadcast electricity later. Radio. Well, yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, I guess you could if, assuming that you didn't have to have like, you know, a hydroelectric dam or oil or whatever it, it to, uh, create energy, assuming that in every inch of the universe there was infinite energy, then you would just, every house would become a power plant. It wouldn't all be based on wherever the main energy is coming from, the nuclear power plant or whatever. It would be some sort of device that you could put in your house. They could channel the, the energy, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:14:07       channel. But what, what are they calling that energy? Like what is it? Just something we haven't figured out and discovered yet? Something we haven't figured out. And so instead of this the crude method of pulling oil out of the ground and light it on fire, that there's another step.

Speaker 3:          00:14:21       Well, yeah, or you know, I mean it's obvious. I mean, look at fucking, uh, the solar panels, right? I mean, there's a, there's, there's enough energy from the sun that to keep every organic form make that the law. Why don't they just make that roofs? You know, in California you have to have solar panels on it.

Speaker 4:          00:14:38       Well, it's no fuck laws, man. You don't need to make more laws. The last thing we need is more people telling people what they have to spend their fucking money.

Speaker 3:          00:14:45       It's also expensive to make them an n n the a amount of time it takes you forever to recoup the amount it costs to install and make them right. Right now it's financially a good deal, but they can be done. They give you a tag backs or whatever they're called. Uh, I don't know. They give you money back. I would think about doing it just to get off the grid. That's fine. Sand when I lived in Colorado, I wanted to

Speaker 4:          00:15:03       do that. Tom. Um, what Chia Saunas [inaudible] yeah. Fuck. I can't forget his name. A friend of mine. Anyway, he uh, he had a windmill set up at his house. That's cool. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:15:15       those are awesome man. I love passing those fields and when males, it's so cool.

Speaker 4:          00:15:20       Yeah. He, um, he had a windmill set up at his house and he, uh, he was giving money back. Like they would give him money rather than me giving energy back to the grid, which is crazy. He was making numbers on energy.

Speaker 3:          00:15:31       You know what, man, the thing, the thing I've been thinking lately is that, uh, it's, we live in such a funny time because I guess people just don't like if you start saying things like, no, you know what? I have the feeling there's actually another energy source out there that we haven't even stumbled upon yet that has like all a million times more energy than you could ever need. If you say that now people really will, you seem kind of like a fruit or a flake or an 88 or they are like here, well bays it in science. You don't know what that is or you don't know what you're talking about. But there was a time when if you were just talking about electricity, you would've seen like an absolute lunatic. Like if you went around in the, I dunno, 12 hundreds and started telling people, listen, there's this fucking energy called electricity that's more powerful than fire. You can use it to, you can, you can run it through wires and if you touch it, you'll get electrocuted. They go like, get this fucking, which on the stake? What are you talking about? War Lock. We are going to harness lightening. Yeah. Yeah. What are you talking Frankenstein? What are you talking about? But so in the same way, man, I think that there's probably, I've been thinking about, it's such a, I have this weird idea.

Speaker 4:          00:16:37       Do you remember when Frankenstein, when he made that fucking chick, when? When were you made when they made Frankenstein and they actually had to get lightning to make him a lot of, they had a good idea how to hit the tower with lightning.

Speaker 3:          00:16:48       Wait, you mean they really did that? Are you saying that one of the movies, the movie back to the future?

Speaker 4:          00:16:54       Hmm. One of the Frankenstein movies.

Speaker 3:          00:16:56       Remember when they did them? I know, I know Frankenstein was fucking, I know that like Frankenstein what I've like had to have like a hit of whitening to bring the person to life. That's right. I'm sorry I interrupted you. So go back to what you're saying. Well No, what I was thinking is it's like, okay, so like what if like you look at like, I know this is something I so wish that you can do and you'll never be able to do it, but it would be so amazing to look at from the beginning of time to right now and like a 22nd fast forward to see what that blur of happening look like or the, you know, the good, the evolution. It'd be so fun to be able to see in a real way what evolution look like from, you know, the evolution of a fucking, I don't know, the evolution of a chicken and do a or a dinosaur and do a chicken.

Speaker 3:          00:17:39       It'd be amazing to watch. That thing happened really fast to be really cool. But so like, okay, so this is gonna sound crazy and I'm sorry if it seems rambling and weird cause I haven't quite figured out how to articulate this idea. But like if you have, okay, you have fire, fire leaves a trace, you know, where there's, where there's been a fire, there's suit, there's ashes, black suit, whatever from the carbon's being released in the fire, right. The carbon rather. So in the same way I was thinking, what if there's another form of energy that's raging through time and this form of energy instead of leaving ashes leaves evolved things. It's like the, the biproduct of the energy is that it causes things to evolve and advance and grow and become more sophisticated. You know, and like maybe that energy that there's literally an, an energy associated with evolution.

Speaker 3:          00:18:28       There's an energy that you can tap into. And so when you see like, which is why you know computers are so amazing is because they can really tap into that energy right away in the form of like open source software and stuff like that. And you see things that go open source or things that allow the most people to have the most input to the most intelligent people. Having the input create the advance in whatever the thing is. You know, the classic example of it as a silly example of it, it's like reddit where someone will write something and then the top comment inevitably will be so fucking funny because hundreds and hundreds of people have like voted it up to the top. So it creates this evolved way of getting information to float up to the surface. So in the same way it's like, that's brilliant.

Speaker 3:          00:19:11       It's fucking, it's, yeah, it's brilliant. Awesome. It's the way our government should work. If someone Youtube Cummins do that too. Yeah, yeah. It goes up to the top. So like that's a form of like tuning into this energy, this like evolutionary force as it's manifesting, you know, and the form of the most, uh, the, the comment that his mo, the strongest comment or the comment that works best in that particular zeitgeists their paradigm goes to the top. That comment is the fucking animal that survives that comments. The animal that in its environment does the best. And it's getting there through, um, you know, people voting. But what I'm saying is technology like harnessed the evolutionary, uh, flow in that situation. So I'm thinking, okay, maybe evolution itself is an energy. What if you could fucking harness that shit? Remember in Star Trek, what was it called? The genesis beam or whatever. They blast the planet with the thing that makes the life grow out of it all of a sudden. Wow. I don't remember that at all. Which was that the new star trek reverse spoiler alert. No, no, it's an old one. I think it would have to incur the wrath of Khan. Oh, the wrath of Khan. Don't you remember the RAF and Ricardo [inaudible] bonds? Fuck yeah, with the ear.

Speaker 4:          00:20:21       I was like, how the fuck are you going to have the dude from fantasy island be the bad guy in a fucking star trek movie? I think you did great out of here, bitch. Yeah, he was great. He was great. I mean he's a great actor, don't get me wrong. But when at the time she was like, this is the dumbest Shit I've ever heard of in my life. And they're like, no. Ricardo Montalban he's a very respected actor. Yeah, he was handsome bastard man kind of pussy. He got off of fantasy island. Your fantasies can through with die. Did he die? I bet he overdosed from Posey. I bet they'll the line of chicks. They wanted to fuck him in the 70s it's probably still outside of his house. They just get into them right now cause I have no time for all of you girls. Welcome to fantasy island. He had his own midget, he was the first guy on TV to have his own midget.

Speaker 3:          00:21:08       Yeah. And, and you know, have you ever seen the pilot? No. It's Kinda creepy man. It's like diabolic like that character Rourke, that was his name, right? Rourke was, uh, in the pilot it was almost like he was Satan or something. Like he was like some dark being really. Yeah. Cause you know, in, in history, uh, in a cult history, which is always have amps are familiars that a common way to know that you're around. Like that's why, you know, like David Lynch and twin peaks, that spooky little fucking backwards talking midget, you know the guy that table is for Micah. Right? Um, so like that's an a cult symbol I like, which is what always have around them and lower, they would always have like a cat, you know, some kind of creature. And sometimes they'd have a little emp Earl or creature with them. So Monto bond. Rourke's tattoo was his name. It seemed like in the pilot they were thinking, let's make this like heat. Let's make him a feisty in character where he's like, when he's not, you know, he's maybe not giving people exactly what they want. Cause remember some people would want something and it fuck them up.

Speaker 4:          00:22:14       Didn't they redo fantasy island for a little while? I don't know. Did they, didn't they or was it the love boat? No, it was fantasy island. That's Jerry Redd. Wilson. Yeah. That's how he died. There's this comic named Jerry Redd Wilson and he supposed to go and film fantasy island and he apparently had meningitis and he did know he just had a headache. Yeah. Like knew something was wrong and he went to the doctor and I guess the line was ridiculous and he wound up just couldn't take it anymore and he left the doctor and you want to die. Oh Shit. Yeah. Get yourself checked out people. It's just not, not as, not a bad thing to do. Smart. But um, point is, I'm pretty sure he was going to do fantasy island. It was a fucking great show back in the day, dude. What a great idea. People have fantasies, they fly in, they get welcomed by this magic man and it's magical island is going to make your dreams come true and teach you a little lesson. Bitch. They always taught you a nice little lesson and g and quiet. And then let you, you leave the island and you kind of get it now.

Speaker 3:          00:23:09       Wait, did everyone, did everyone who came in on that plane leave on the plane? Didn't some people not make it out? I, I, I don't know.

Speaker 4:          00:23:18       You can't have people die on your island, Ben Fucking, you see what happens with Aruba is said fucking 19 year old chick from Arizona or something like that. It's just on a vacation. And you know, a rube was like where they turn up missing, right? That's right. Scary was the one with the boat. Gilligan's island. But the other one with the boat love boat, the lowest got love boat in that show mixed up. Oh, did people die on the left though? No fucking way. No. No shows ever. I don't know. I probably was like, they should

Speaker 3:          00:23:47       the love boat ship wrecks on fantasy

Speaker 4:          00:23:50       that didn't like go for from the love boat become a politician. He did, I believe.

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       Yeah. Yeah. I need to research that. But I uh, I'm pretty sure he did. I'm pretty sure he became like a senator. So politicians are, they are this, I cannot wait until the day and this day will never come. But that day when we have zoos, where politicians are placed in zoos, like antiquated things like kids can come and look at them.

Speaker 4:          00:24:15       Behold Fred Grandy, that's his name. He's a politician. He was a congressman. He used to be, go for Weirdos, man on our kind of crazy shit they did back in those days because that then when they did shit, they could totally get away with everything. You know, they just were complete freaks. Like, remember that movie about the guy from Hogan's heroes at the fuck's his name? The, the, the main dude wound up killing himself. And um, you don't know the movie I'm talking about? No, it's a great movie. Um, here, let me look it up real quick because it's, it's really important. It was the, the guy from talk soup. John Hanson. No, no grey patch.

Speaker 4:          00:24:58       Uh, uh, the dude from love letter movies, love letter movies. What is his name? Kissy face movies. Fuck, I can't auto focus. That's the movie. Greg Kinnear. You got it. Yeah. Pam, it's a great fucking movie. Um, they don't got a 6.6 on the IMD B. How dare you get an excellent movie. I know. I didn't want to bring the legacy of this movie auto focus. If you haven't seen it, you must, you must see it. It's about this guy, whatever the fuck his name was, Bob Crane, he was a sex fiend, like a complete the charts sex fiend. And he started out on the show have married guy. And uh, somehow or another he got so many girls from being on Hogan's heroes that he just completely became out of control, didn't take care of his career, taking care of his family, just with just banging chicks and filming and all and like their stack.

Speaker 4:          00:25:54       Any eventually wound up getting murdered. And it was a very sorted thing cause they believed that the guy who played the Willem defoe character was the one who killed them. And they even, I think they have that in the movie as well. But either way, it's our great grateful. They fucking hated each other there, boning together and shit. It probably got jealous that, uh, Bob Crane was getting all the Punana, you know, he used to sit in front of a television at a bar when he knew that the show would be on so that they could see him. They'll show was like long since canceled. It would be on in reruns and he would be doing like local theater like at these towns and he would just bang all the local broads and filming. They were freaks back then. They didn't have any Twitter, they didn't have any TMZ. You could just go off.

Speaker 3:          00:26:39       You didn't have to worry about it. If something was on a VHS tape, I mean he's was, the VHS was like 18 millimeter,

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       eight millimeter or 16 millimeter over the hell it is. You know those little reels, you had to play it on a projection thing and he was like one of the first dudes to be on top of that shit, that technology of filming things.

Speaker 5:          00:26:58       And you see those naked pictures of that girl that, that were released, that actress check what actress chuck. I, and she has to be in a new movie soon because there's no way that that that's just happens to be released. You know, that's the big talk on the Internet too. Let me see. What's her name?

Speaker 4:          00:27:13       I don't know who that is, man. I've no idea. No, she's like super famous. Yeah, that girl. Super Fun. Yeah, she's a me. I picked up the cover of one of those us weekly things, whatever it is, one of those inside something or other and I didn't know who any of the people on it where I literally knew who none of the celebrity don't know any celebrities aren't like your Hansen and I fee. I was like, I think I've won. I think I won. Yeah. It's good to not know celebrity names like in this, this one battle with gossip. I got free cause I had no attachment to any of them and it occurred to me when I looked at the magazine and I didn't have any attachment. I'll be like, God damn. And if there was a fucking some Jennifer Aniston broken heart because Gerard Butler, you know, fucking did her wrong.

Speaker 4:          00:27:58       I'd be like, Oh, why would that guy do? I'd have to go read it. I would have to go read it. I'm invested in that storyline, but there's like, there was some guy on from the Bachelorette and some girl on from fucking orange county wives or something like that. I didn't know who anybody was. I was like, this is great. And they had a couple like little teeny boppers, you know, and you know Joe, he breaks up with Demi wants her back. I'm like, Oh, who the fuck they are either. And it occurred to me, while I didn't have any idea who any of these people were, how freeing that was. It is like a little God damn drug. If there's some fucking crazy story about someone who, you know their storyline, like tiger woods, you know tiger woods, you know a man resurfaces, you know tiger woods apparently was bisexual and they did that and that was on the cover of us weekly.

Speaker 4:          00:28:47       That would be like a God damn tractor beam. You wouldn't be able to avoid it. If I sent you a link and it was photos of tiger woods kissing a man, you are so God damn connected to that storyline, you would, you would, it would be impossible to get you to not click that link. If you had, if you had the photograph, you'd be a millionaire. If you ever had that photograph and you put that online, I guarantee you it would be like 100% click through. Like if you send people it and they know they have this link and they click this link and they see tiger woods kicking that dude click, it'd be like 100% like no one's gonna go, who cares? No one's going to say that. They're going to see people are invested in that storyline because it's such a charged one.

Speaker 4:          00:29:26       Such a big scandal, very unattractive guy, beautiful wife Guy, super, super fucking successful, like ridiculous. Really Rich, the greatest golfer perhaps ever, and just fucks everyone. Just fucks everyone. So it's so highly charged that if something else happened to it and it's like, well, I'm already invested in this tiger woods story. I can't believe he's kissing guys. You know you would, I would be drawn to it, but all these people, like one of them was, you know, I don't know any of them. I don't know, age people. One was like a on America's got talent or something and I don't know the fuck any of them were. I was like, this is awesome. I could walk away. I don't have to read it. I don't have to open this up.

Speaker 3:          00:30:04       Great. It's gravity man. It's like that Shit's got gravity. It's got attention. Gravity. Like some stuff in the world act does the same thing to your attention that the planet does. Dale like satellites. It'll grab your attention and suddenly you're circling this weird like a temporary vortex in the subjective reality, the planet with your attention. And it's so stupid. I mean, there's so many things that have that example. Football, fucking uh, any sports is the exact same attention. Gravity, video games, attention, gravity, girls' attention, gravity, mu, it's all like different, quite gravitational fields that will, depending on what person you're like, you're going to get your attention sucked into this certain thing. And once it gets sucked in deep enough, you're not thinking about anything else. No. That's true thing when everything shuts down except for whatever this silly thing is that when you're locked in a video game, yes, that's it. You will negate yourself if you get stuck deep enough into a video game. Complete introversion. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:31:02       Do you think that it's like a hijacking of our natural ward system by this new creation by it is what it is, right? Because you know, I've always said that we're sort of set up to imitate successful behavior. Right. But I don't think we can differentiate 100%. You know, how we can't differentiate between a placebo and, um, and an actual drug in certain situations. Even if the person knows that something is a placebo, they showed marked effects, you know, if they're concentrating on this actually having some sort of an effect, it shows sort of some sort of effects.

Speaker 3:          00:31:36       Oh yeah, totally. I read that placebo, I know it's, I don't understand that, but I, I get it. If the police CBO affects amazing. That's why people have different rituals. They do. What was my point? I had a point where you get the same effect though from me. What do we were just talking about? We're talking about attention, tension. Vampires were talking about the forces of nature that grab your attention and you were saying, is that based on a reward system? Is that like, is it hijacking the reward system?

Speaker 4:          00:32:00       Right. Okay. That's what I meant. What I meant by that is that we've created something with like w like big events. Anything that you see in your life that's memorable, the, they're very shocking and engaging because you need to learn from this situation. If you could come over a hill and you stumble upon a bunch of barbarians slaughtering a village with axes, this is supposed to shock the fucking shit out of, you're supposed to be aware that this is all possible. This is like, oh my God, you could be dying right now. You need to learn from this, but when we recreate that in some sort of a crazy imaginary flacked, one dimensional or two dimensional image with sound that comes from all around you, I don't know if your brain 100% can differentiate that from reality any more than a placebo has an effect on a person. I wonder. I wonder.

Speaker 3:          00:32:56       You know what it is, dude, I'm sorry to cut you off. When you take your cat and you have one of those like, I don't know any cat toy, watch what it does to your cats attention. Your cat goes from like, if your cat gets into it enough, it stops being a toy and now the cats obviously thinks it's the a bird. It's intuit, it's in nature again and it's stalking it's and it's attention. It's totally sucked into that cat toy. That's what video games are for. The human nervous system. They were like, he, they're like human cat toys. You're playing this fucking cat toy. Your attention sucked into it in like, you know people when they party, when they portray aliens coming down, they're going to use laser guns to subdue us. Fuck that. They're just going to like some super advanced being which is analyze our nervous system and just like hypnotize us. That's what it would do.

Speaker 4:          00:33:45       Well, Laura, assuming that life is going to be hard or assuming that life isn't going to be like a fucking Wifi frequency, right? Just because we are physical and we are hard and we touch things and move them and manipulate matter, it doesn't mean all life has to do that. Do we? We know that bacteria doesn't do that. We can't even fucking see it. We know what we need. Some crazy lens that magnifies our normal reality down to the point where it's supposed to be completely invisible to us. Like we're not supposed to be able to see it. Right, right. Yeah. We can find it and we can find that there's some life there. There's something there. Intelligent life might be ideas. Intelligent life might be creativity. What creativity might be is when you just relax the fuck enough to listen to this intelligent life that's all around you. This training get you to move your monkey body in a certain way where you're going to manipulate matter to the point where you punch a fucking hole through space and time. And the idea of tangible objects no longer exists. Right? Like that's the destiny. That's what, that's your reason for your curiosity as a reason why you've created music and motivation and cocaine. You're supposed to be pushing towards this inevitable goal of creating some sort of a fucking opening where this thing changes into the next thing.

Speaker 3:          00:35:07       You know what that made me just think of like, imagine, you know, like when those miners got stuck in the mind. Yeah. Imagine if like when they got stuck in the mine, so I'm kind of fume came out, they gave them complete Amnesia and so they completely lost their identities and couldn't even speak any language anymore. And so, uh, they thought that that's where they were born as this stupid mind. And imagine the people outside the mine would first have to teach them English, teach them a language, teach them who they were, give them all this information first before they could get trapped out of, you know, escape from the mind. So in the same way, maybe this whole dimension is some kind of Cavan and on the other side of it, there's like super advanced beings that are trying to teach us like, hey, wake up, you know, try this, try this, try this. You'll have to get smarter before they, cause like if you can't tell someone in the 18 hundreds about electricity, you sure as fuck can't tell them about the most

Speaker 4:          00:36:00       diverse. This is going to sound totally crazy. All right. But what if people are to ideas what reconditioned laptops are two people. And that when you get a recondition laptop, you've got a laptop that's all his hard drive, all the space and the operating system and then you swipe all the data at and just give it to someone to add their own stuff to completely clean. Yeah. Like, but has this past, you know? Yeah. And that is what it like a human is. You come into this life, you press the reset button, press or re, what is that?

Speaker 5:          00:36:38       It's kind of like Carlos when see it. I don't get it. I was talking about that tweet. I have nowhere what? Tweet? Chris Hardwick. Sweet. Oh

Speaker 4:          00:36:50       God damn dude, you lost me. Totally. Yeah, of course. Hardworking. Brian and I had a conversation about stitcher. I think are co other people see podcasting differently than we do though. You know, there's a lot of people that are trying to monetize their podcasts and um, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:37:06       when you're in the top five or top 10, all right, he was breaking down 3000 listeners. Uh, an episode on stitcher. 3000 is how many would he, how many people listen on stitcher and your keys in the top four of comedy, iTunes rankings, right. I know the numbers just because we did, we did this show, I'm not gonna say the numbers, but I'm just going to say 3000 is not going to affect anything in the top five.

Speaker 4:          00:37:31       Well, it's a, it really depends on what you're doing. Some people are actually selling their iTunes podcasts and the there building up towards the point where they're gonna sell them. And then some people they, they, there's not though. Okay. But some people have advertising that's based on their iTunes ranking. You know, it could be based on how many hits you get on iTunes. And in that sense he's absolutely right. Cause in that sense, if he doesn't want to shit on stitcher and they, I believe they pulled it off, he's absolutely right because he gets paid by iTunes. What he should be able to do is go to the company that's sponsoring them and say, well, here's, there's another application called stitcher. It's very easy to track. Why can't we work that into it? Say let's say, you know, I get x amount per, you know, thousand downloads on iTunes and then, you know, a percentage, uh, of the downloads on stitcher. It seems to me that it's, if it's trackable, you should still be able to run the ads on it. As far as I know, they don't, uh, they don't do any editing of your show.

Speaker 5:          00:38:26       They don't do any of that. The only thing it is, it's a banner on the APP, which is about one 12th of the APP. Right. And it's like, uh, from Hardwick's numbers that

Speaker 3:          00:38:35       he did it in a blog post, I can't remember the exact number. I want to say it was uh, 800 every 800 views of that teeny banner on that APP. He gets a dollar, which sucks. But knowing what Google adsense pays for like views of ad, it's not far off.

Speaker 4:          00:38:51       Well, I, I, you know some man, he's got his own thing. He, he likes doing it a certain way and he should be able to, it's his, it's his product. I'm, I'm agreeing with Chris Hardwick a hundred percent. But for us, we have a totally different take on stitcher because I, the podcast is, first of all, we started off with, it wasn't supposed to be a job, it was a goof. It was just me and Brian having fun and why I wanted to do it too is just to do something. I thought it would be fun to just do it and do it on a regular basis. And people like things that are free. It's good. It's good to give people free shit. I think it's in the spirit of things, you know? It shows that the entertainment that you're trying to provide, you're really trying to provide it for the sake of it. If you don't, you know what I'm saying? Like you know how he don't have any ulterior motives. You're just doing it for the sake you're trying to make it good. You're trying to make it fun. People will respond to that and they like it and they'll do, they'll support you in other ways. They'll come see your comedy show. They'll

Speaker 3:          00:39:41       no what, man, whatever. That's where we did. I just say I disagree with that. I think it's awesome to give free content, but I also think it's fine to charge for,

Speaker 4:          00:39:49       no, no, no. You're missing turban me. I do not think there's anything wrong with charging it. I just don't need to, so since I don't need to, I make it free. Right. It's that simple. If I needed to look like in your case, I know that you charged occasionally for podcasts, we do an extra episode a week and charge a buck. Right. And this has been like a a source of controversy and some fucking dummy on my message board wrote some whole thing about how he's upset at you because you charge for a podcast and all that. I fucking pay, you know, listen, no one is telling you you will have to pay and in fact Dunkin is actually giving you something for free still. He does an extra one a week and then the extra one he wants to see if he can make some money. We know what's particularly to me, what's gross man, people are gross.

Speaker 3:          00:40:28       But I think it's a, it's, it's, it's, I know it's, I, that's what I thought originally, but then when I started thinking about it more, I realized that it uncovers this certain layer of conditioning that exists in people because like when you go to the ATM and the ATM asks you for two Bucks or whatever to get cash out because you're not at your bank, you're just like, ah, fuck it. Do it when you're at the gas station and it's like 35 cents convenience fee. I don't even know what that fucking means, but I'll pay it. But the moment artists start saying, hey, I, I like to make money for this stuff I'm making. People are like, what the fuck you're gonna charge for that Shit. They, but if

Speaker 4:          00:41:06       I see you're getting it for free, you mean? Well, they're getting it for free. If you start charging from the beginning, people have no problem with continued to pay for things. Yeah, yeah. It's, once they start getting it for free,

Speaker 3:          00:41:15       that's all. We added an extra episode and experiment totally worked. And it made me think, you know, this is a model. Maybe this is a new model that other people can use. It's like instead of pulling the rug out from people's feet and saying, you're paying now I'm charging for everything. You always offer some free thing for people to enjoy and then you add one extra thing to. It's if people are really into it and don't mind paying. Most people send us emails saying they like supporting the show. They like it.

Speaker 4:          00:41:44       Well, most people do. The reason why people get upset is the reason why people there. There's people that find something anywhere to get angry at and it's because they're looking for it. They're looking for something to piss them off. And if you're angry at some guy whose podcast you like because he would like a dollar for an hour and a half's worth of, uh, him talking, I understand what you don't. If you don't have a buck, like, look, I've been there before, man. I've been to points in my life where I rolled pennies so I'd have something to eat for dinner. I understand poverty. I've, I've been there for a long time. I totally get that. You don't have to buy it, but you have to be fucking mad that he's selling it. And by the blessing, when someone's giving you something

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       for free, and also, by the way, how about you email me and ask for the fucking MP3? There's like a 99% chance. I probably wouldn't

Speaker 4:          00:42:31       just send it to you. Just fucked up and said on the Internet was the one time I would have done unto email. Never do it again. Okay, well, whatever. Trolled by a hot chick, right? It's really a dude. Ah, that will be tearing at whatever height you fucked up. You open up the gates, you challenged. There's all this time he challenged the hackers in the world right there to what? To a duel. I do not just mentoring. I know you said you were, you said you were respond to email. You saying you respond to emails is like opening up the gates to hell sure. That someone's going to go, okay, how do I get this one? The fuck could it looks stupid.

Speaker 3:          00:43:08       Oh No. Next game. Now I'm paranoid. Now we got to exist in like a Philip k Dick Universe with like being terrified of people who email me. I do. You know what, by the way, people already know I respond to shit cause I talked to people on Facebook and you do on occasion get some emails from people that it really seems like these are cops. You know what I mean? For sure. I got an email from somebody who's like, hi me and my buds. We're thinking of taking some magic mushrooms and we're wondering if you could tell us where to get them or could send us some in the mail. But it was like the slang they were using was like, like sides. But yeah it was weird. Obviously worse. First of all, you hippie ever. Even if it was serious like I'm going to be like, oh sure

Speaker 4:          00:43:55       his mail you an illegal substance is really hilarious. Yeah, it's very, it's very spooky. I had a guy wanted to get DMT from me and Cleveland. I knew he was a cop cause the first of all, who the fuck is asking me for DMT, Cleveland and Cleveland. I mean Cleveland and this guy is a crew cut. He's looking at me and I'm like, this guy isn't this rock. He's not high. And you know, you know, I'm assessing a dude, I'm looking at this guy. I'm like, this guy seems like he's had some self defense training. Right? It seems like he's a confident man. It seems like he's in a, he's acting what? He's got some weird like um, feeling of authority about him. I was like, he's almost like, he expects authority. He expects you to like this guy was like such an obvious cause.

Speaker 4:          00:44:36       Ridiculous because a bad cop or at least a dumb cop, they get a, a feeling of entitlement around people. You know, a dumb one. I've seen it a bunch of times and I'm a big supporter of cops and I always say that the 99% of cops are just trying to do a good job. It's the 1% of cons that fuck it up for everybody else. You know, they run a pretty fucking tight ship and most police for sure, but this guy just eat of cop. I was like, what are you talking about man? And he goes, he goes, he goes, come on man, DMT. He's like looking at me and I'm looking at him, we're making eye contact. I'm like, motherfucker, the last thing you want is DMT. You're not looking for DMT. You fucking Weirdo.

Speaker 6:          00:45:11       Yeah. You know and I, and I was like, I said

Speaker 4:          00:45:14       weirdest stare off man. It was so strange. I think associate cause cause he was totally full of Shit. There was no way this guy was looking at trip. He wasn't looking at Trevor, he was looking to fucking arrest me.

Speaker 6:          00:45:24       You're not know that marijuana thing that John Have Ron gave you? Yeah. Ever since that show, every day this guy rob writes to me and he adds an extra hundred dollars. He goes a hundred dollar donation. If you send me one of those marijuana sticks, $200 donation, he's done it every day. I think I'm up to $500 a month. That's just to tell him to suck your cock on video. Do An internet search. Why Tracy didn't tell him about Google. Yeah. Well, you can't get that shit on. You can't get a vapor I oh really? Yeah. Yeah. Those, these are California. Oh. Oh, I see. I didn't, or maybe probably Colorado's rockets. They're thinking about closing the post office. Yeah, man. I'm tired of getting mail. Yes, me too. Me Too. I never get good. How about, how about we make it so that, just like our answers,

Speaker 4:          00:46:06       Sasha, we get to the point where nothing we have is traceable. Once the big bang happens, right. Fucking rock hits the planet and all our fucking, yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:46:13       Yeah. All our hardware corrodes. We have nothing solid written anywhere. How about no post office and only quarters do you mean only quarters doll or money? Dollar bills and stuff like that. Paper money, but only quarters. No pennies. Nickels and dimes. Everything really. Recording. Stopped doing the, no, I mean, what, what? Did that make sense? I mean, that'd be a good idea. Oh Jesus. Dude. Everything in quarters. Yeah. I mean, how many knowing it seems like it would be a nice excuse for them to raise taxes so that everything runs off to a quarter. Yeah. Yeah. No matter what it rounds off to. The next quarter always raises high and all that goes to the government.

Speaker 4:          00:46:46       That's not a good move. What are you doing? What of those fuck heads? More money had been watching these republican debates. Yeah. Did you see the one where they were talking about the guy dying cause he didn't have any money and didn't have any insurance. She die and the audience was cheering.

Speaker 3:          00:46:59       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:47:00       Tell me about that. What is,

Speaker 3:          00:47:02       well I'll tell you what it is. The tea party is hilarious because the moment you climb out of the pussy it's open game. But when you're in there and no one can touch you, they're all anti abortion. But the moment you're born there like let him die and I'd like you could have a baby that pops out and doesn't have insurance inside the fetus. If the woman wanted to get inside the womb, if the woman wanted an abortion, the tea party be like, no, it's evil. The moment that baby comes out, if it doesn't have insurance, tea parties

Speaker 7:          00:47:31       let it die. It's Mama didn't have insurance, let it die.

Speaker 4:          00:47:35       I don't think they feel that way about babies, what they feel like grown ups on it. But growing up, growing up, you're on your

Speaker 3:          00:47:40       gramma grownups, which is mutated babies.

Speaker 4:          00:47:42       Well, their babies that grew up there, but I don't think they're anti baby. I think they're just, when you get to a certain point, you're supposed to take personal responsibility. I think the way they're going about it is pretty silly. I mean, the idea should be that you should have a sense of community that is earned where everyone contributes. So everyone wants to help everyone. Sure. Our real problem is that there's too many fucking people and that you cannot have communities of 20 million people, right? Because you're going to get a diffusion of responsibility. You're going to get a situation where there's too many fucking people and they're not going to care about one life here or one live there and one person here, one person there. They don't have to. But if you lived in a village of 50 people, everyone want to have to care about everyone and that's how we're supposed to live.

Speaker 4:          00:48:27       We're supposed to live like in the movie Little Red Riding Hood where the, there's a girl with a bug eyes. It's really hot. What's that chick? She's blonde flogger who cares? I don't care what it is very hot. She's in a lot of movies and um, she was in Little Red Riding Hood and they played this little village where there was a werewolf that came was fucking everybody up. I have to see all werewolf mode across even a little red riding hood. But uh, she lives in this little village and as well as watching all these people sort of prepare their town and you know, and, and you know, stockpile everything and prepare for this werewolf. I was like, this is how people really are supposed to live there. Some supposed to live in small communities that are worried about outsiders. That's how they're supposed to live. He supposed to be. Everybody that you know in this little area is your friend. You're all cool, you're cool together, you work together, you eat together, you hunt together, you cook together. Everyone is in this little group. The people that you don't know that come over the hill, those are the ones you have to worry about.

Speaker 3:          00:49:24       I don't think people are supposed to live in any particular way. I think that there's bears, you know, that's what adaptations all about. Sure. So I think that the, you know, now that the real problem isn't that, you know, people are sucking the system dry. The right, the real problem is really quite clear. It just seems like it's right in front of everyone. Diabetes, it's that 2% of the people on the planet have all the wealth. And that's, that's the problem.

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       That is, that is part of the problem. But the other part of the problem is that the biological evolution, the evolution of the animal to human animal itself to adapt to this system of this community being intensely like incredibly larger than it used to be. That our DNA and our, the way we think and behave and it's based on communities and when all of a sudden the community is some abstract number that you can't even wrap your head around a community of 300 million people. Well, that's the only

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       reason why we can except states. And you know, if we just had one giant state, it would be so completely ridiculous. You know, it would be, it would seem so strange.

Speaker 3:          00:50:38       World. The order or like a global, yes.

Speaker 1:          00:50:40       No, I mean the idea of a giant community of bunch of people you don't even fucking know of a, not in a number that's so large. You can't wrap your head around. We don't know what 300 million means. 300 million is just some numbers on a piece of paper. No one's brain registers with 300 million people is, but that's the community that we're involved in. Somehow or another, the world has grown to the point where 300 million people plus the whole rest of the world is constantly communicating at the exact same time, which is something the biological body of today, it's absolutely not ready for. So all of our checks and balances and natural reward systems are completely fucking hijacked. Just like they're hijacked with movies that fucking trick us. Just like their hijack with placebos, just like the whole system is hijacked and we have just have not caught up to how much life has changed,

Speaker 3:          00:51:31       not catching up and and a big reason it is not right

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       catching it is, but slowly it's the, it takes longer than the thing.

Speaker 3:          00:51:39       Well that's because the people who are in control of the system are the 2% who have all the money. That's the fucking problem.

Speaker 1:          00:51:46       But isn't that why the system has gotten this big this fast and the first place? It's almost like you need greed tents. You need a greed and intense ambition and all these things in some form ultimately lead to monarchies ultimately lead to bad things. It's like they get so intense that a person is so competitive about money that they get to the point where they have way more money than they can use and they're fucking over the rest of the world, but they can't even help themselves because it's like an ethic,

Speaker 3:          00:52:14       always an explanation for tyranny. There's always an explanation like that. You can almost always tell there's an x. There's like there's the current explanation is these people the not what you're saying because what you're saying is is is is smart, but the, the, the, the base version is these 2% of the wealthy have earned their money and they deserve to keep it in everyone else. They're lazy fucks. That's the idea. They're just not lucky. They just didn't put their shoulders to the grind stone. They didn't push hard enough and so that's the, that's the idea. Now I think the real truth of the matter is that many of these people have inherited their money. Many of these people, they didn't necessarily earn their money and even if they did earn the fucking money, the fact that there are people in the world with big fat, bloated fucking bellies cause they're starving to death in Somali and we can't get the resources there because some of fundamentalists fucking Islamic organization what the Shit through so that fucking babies can eat.

Speaker 3:          00:53:17       The fact that we're totally cool with that, while simultaneously every bomb we drop costs $100,000 on top of Libya. The fact that we're totally cool with that is an indication to me not have a nervous system not catching up, but a state of people not being educated appropriately and ethics. It seems like a simple thing. We need to fucking t school teachers need to start getting paid that doctors wage school teachers need to start getting paid the same amount of celebrities get paid so that it becomes a competitive industry and only the super smart are the ones who start giving our children like the basic information.

Speaker 4:          00:53:51       You're absolutely right and on that platform you should run for president. But my, my point is not a attached to the human animal as one of its own. My point is looking at it objectively. When I look at it objectively, when I look at the, the way human beings are so intensely focused on wealth and so intensely focused on privilege and of uh, on, on, conquering and taking over things, I really think that it's like a queen bee or like any sort of a natural, you know, a large leader of an ant colony or whatever the fuck it is there. There's some crazy thing that people need in order to accomplish what we are abstract, abstractly, aware of trying to accomplish. And it goes back to this technology thing. You, when you, when you have ambition, any kind of ambition, you're going to have competition.

Speaker 4:          00:54:45       When you have competition, you're always going to have people that take it to the next level. And some people, you know, take it to the next level like Michael Jordan does on the basketball court. Or you know, you've got guys like William Randolph Hearst who takes it to that next level when he was running newspapers. He's just a fucking dominator. Fuck you. I don't give a shit. How about I make up stories and put them on my newspaper? You fuck head. And then I'm going to kill you and I'm going to make up a story and put it in my paper that says you were in the Kiddie porn. You fuckhead I mean, William Randolph Hearst got to some insane point of power, but I almost wonder if instead of looking at these individual circumstances are individual, uh, people that create horrible things and greed and an obscenely wealthy people while other people are starving.

Speaker 4:          00:55:28       Instead of looking at that, I always look at the mechanism itself. Look at the movement itself. Which way is the wave going and why, why, why is it going in the, the most supposedly progressive of all the countries being America, the most hyper aggressive about controlling natural resources and about innovation and have about weapons, about weapons and about science. And today NASA announced that we're going to try to go to Mars, so going to have manned missions to Mars, a giant fucking thing, like, like the Saturn five rocket on steroids. They're going to send astronauts to Mars. And you know, this keeps American. This is one of the big points of their point. The keeps America in the leader in this space race. People are worried that we're losing the space race because we can no longer put people in the, the, the space station. We have to rely on the Soviets. And the Soviets just crashed one of their shuttles the other day. So now we're like, um, you guys, did you change the oil? What are you doing? We don't even know what they did were hopping on their plane.

Speaker 5:          00:56:28       You know, that we still have space racist. That's like the last Olympics. You know, this is like the dumbest thing that were in these, the Olympics with other countries that we got to go farther, faster first.

Speaker 4:          00:56:37       Yeah. But no, because it pushes innovation and it pushes people to really, I mean, whether or not you believe people will end up on the moon. I know it sounds retarded. I was 12 questions. Um, and people go, well put, I got answers. You know, there's like this recent photographs of the moon landing and everybody sends them to me and they're like, what do you think, man? What do you think? And I think if I was guilty of something. Okay, and I sent you a picture that showed that I wasn't guilty or something and it was really fucking blurry and it looks like it was taken from a million miles away and black and white. Would you believe me? No. Oh, I'm sure that this is a satellite photo. It's very likely that it is. I leave open the possibility that it's not and people say that's crazy and I probably is.

Speaker 5:          00:57:19       Is that possibility 1% or how? How big it?

Speaker 4:          00:57:22       I have no idea. Then I would know because they look, this is what I would say. I would say if it's 99% if there's 1% why was that 1% therefore what the fuck did therefore it's 99% means I really believe it. I just see leave it open. I don't have a percentage labeled on it. I think the people in the 60s and the 70s were full of shit. I think the government was intensely full of Shit. I think the Nixon Nixon had wrenched administration was deceptive as a practice, generally across the board, completely full of Shit and without accountability until they got busted in Watergate and the shit that went on in the Vietnam War. How they got into the Vietnam War from the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which was a big fat fuck

Speaker 5:          00:58:04       can lie. Do you think the government would have learned by now like, Hey, we're getting into some harder age. Hold on. We're not going to lie. I don't know. I don't know

Speaker 4:          00:58:12       cause they still do shit that's fucked up. Who get the Pamela smart or not Pamela smart case. The girl who got the girl who got rescued in Iraq. What the fuck is her name? The Fun on polling anybody's names out today, but the point was this girl with Jessica Lynch, she was in the hospital. They said there was a gun fight. She was kidnapped, they had a rescue or they're brought it back. She was an American hero. Well, it turns out she was not in a gun fight at all. She was in a fucking hospital. There was no guns fire. They went in and got her and they made up a god damn story. The Pat Tillman story. Pat Tillman died because of fucking friendly fire. Someone made a mistake and he died, you know? But when they put that story out, they did not say that. When they put that story out, they said he died in defense of our country.

Speaker 4:          00:58:50       Meanwhile, Pat Tillman, when he was over there, was a huge, he went from being a huge supporter of the war to going over there and openly criticizing and saying was a gigantic cluster fuck of epic proportions. And his brother's still maintains that to this day. So they lie about shit. They make shit up. But I don't know whether or not they've made up landing on the moon. I don't know whether or not they killed Kennedy. I don't know. I leave those open. I leave those open because I think it's very possible. It's, there's nothing, there's etched in stone shit to me. Here's something etched in stone edged in stone. There was a man named Kennedy shot and cats. Right? That's actually the stone. I don't know what the fuck happened to him. I don't know. It's fascinating to me the whole idea of this bullet magically showing up on governor Connolly's Gurney, they bring them in.

Speaker 4:          00:59:35       Oh, I think we found the bullet. This bullet didn't look like he gets shot through anything. It's ridiculous. There's more fragments of metal supposedly in their bodies that are missing from this bullet. You know, attribute that to what you will, but the idea that you could shoot a bullet through fucking bone and no one's ever been able to recreate that. They tried that in one of those fucking shows and the only way their ability to make it look anything even close to that bullet, they had to shoot it through like gelatin that it's treated through like fake skin that's supposed to replicate gelatin. But as soon as you hit a bone that's a rap song. That bullet was warped and fucked up. That's what happens to bill. It's man, it's supposed to be like that. They fragment inside your body and they create more damage.

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       They shatter things. They're led with a shield on them of of another metal, like brass or something like that. And when they, depending on what you have and they hit things, they fuck up, they bend up. That Kennedy bullet didn't go through shit. They shot that thing into a fucking fish tank. The thing we like, it never had anything like it hit a million pillows, didn't look like in fucking hitting anything hard like a bone and shattered someone's wrist. I don't buy that for a God damn second. And if you do buy that, you're looking for that to be the answer. You know? And the only reason why they ever even said, you know, people dispute the positioning of the magic bullet, the positioning look. But you know, Anthony Bordain had a really good point when you talked about people that get shot when he was on our podcast.

Speaker 4:          01:00:45       Talk about some people get shot and the bullet ricochets inside their head and exits out the back and doesn't even do any damage. It was totally true. Crazy things can happen when you're shooting bullets for people. People have been shot through the head and nothing happens to them. Literally shot through the fucking head. They have a hole straight through their head and they live and they don't have any functioning, you know, they're, they're allowed to walk around there. They're fine. They can rehab. It's amazing. Some people know, but every time you shoot a bullet into something, that bullet gets fucked up every time, every time. And that bull, if you look at that bullet, it's so clear that bullet didn't hit anything. There's no fucking way. It went through two different people. There's no way. And the only reason why they even had to say it went through to people is because we had to attribute three bullets to one person because they found a guy who was under the underpass who was hit with a ricochet.

Speaker 4:          01:01:36       When that guy, when it hit the curb, the ricochet of the granite came up, hit this guy, fucked him up. He had to go to the hospital. What happened? I got hit with a ricochet. They've found the spot on the concrete or the, uh, the, the granite, the whatever. There's the curbs don't where it had been hit by the bullet. So they knew he was telling the truth though. Here's a bullet hole, okay? This is where the guy got hit. So they had to that. Now they have three wounds. Now they have all these shots and they don't, or two, I guess two wounds. And they had to attribute one of them, two to one in two different people's bodies to the same bullet. It's completely unscientific. Instead of saying, what are the, what is the possibility that even though we caught Lee Harvey Oswald would, if there was a guy on the roof above him, what if there was a, is that possible?

Speaker 4:          01:02:15       And No, no, no, no, no. Impossible. Is it pos? No. Nothing possible. Let's talk to this guy and find, oh, this fucking mob collected guy or mob connected guy ran up to him and shot him in broad daylight, in the stomach, in front of everybody and police officers. What, what happened? What kind of fucking charade are you running here? Oh, the guy who killed Kennedy is dead. Oh, well that's convenient. There you go. Well, let's go back to work in Vietnam and uh, Lyndon Johnson's going to take care of everybody. He loves you. He's a, he's a good old boy and it's terrible to happen that boy Kennedy. But you know what? Sometimes those younguns it's fucking Massachusetts boys. They don't know how to shut the fuck up. Yeah. They clink whiskey glasses and they proceed to fuck headless tie whores, you know, come on man, those guys are animals. Those guys are all savages.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       Let me think. Brian said about how, um, maybe now they've, they're not doing that anymore. I think that, oh, it's nonsense. But I think that idea is like a prevalent idea and it's a hilarious idea because if you look back at every age and history, things accelerate, you will find that in every age there was an idea people had about something that was okay, that a later age found to be completely an absolutely rock. Most recently segregation. There was a time when, I guess our grandparents, they would really like go to use the bathroom and they'd be like, oh, there's the white person's bathroom. And then they would say to whoever was working for them, like if they happen to take their a black made on a shopping trip, they'd be like, oh, there's the colored restroom. You can go use that. And that was normal.

Speaker 3:          01:03:54       They didn't do that with some sense of like, ah, I don't know if I should do this or not do them. That was a normal state of existence. If you go back a little bit before that, there was slavery. You would go over to your friend's house and your friend would have a fucking dude that he had bought. Did I had to do everything he said because it was as new beat it. Yeah, he beat it. He beat a human fucking being. That was totally normal. And then if you go back a little bit before that, you would wake up in the morning and your cow's milk would be sour and you would go and say to your wife, I think there's a witch nearby. And she'd be like, well, who? Who Do you think it is? And you minute and you find a woman and you'd fucking incinerator on a Goddamn pyre that was just before slavery.

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       Now somehow people think that right now we've got all figured out and there's not something equally insane that we all considered to be a total normal facet of reality like all of a sudden know all of society's totally got it figured out. No, we don't have it figured out. The truth of the matter is there is a hive mind. People are leaders in their people who have under who understand that in primate neurology, there is a way to tune in to that fucking frequency of attention and convince people that you're the president, the leader, the king and the Queen, whatever the fuck it is you want to call it. You can convince primates if you like, spend the fucking spiral in front of them in the right way. You can convince them that you're their leader and they'll just believe it. Oh yeah, that's a leader.

Speaker 3:          01:05:24       He is our president. How? He's my president now. Somebody saw that them. Then I said, noodle fight. He's my president. Fight you. You got to respect the president. He's our president who's our president. Don't talk about our president that way. Now, this is a clearly a form of conditioning and a form of hypnosis and what I think that that, that's like the final thing for us to overcome. We got over fucking slavery, but it's a weird thing when you're not supposed to discuss that. No Way. You're not supposed to. It's got to be current guitar.

Speaker 4:          01:05:51       You're an intelligent person. If you're an intelligent person, he respected person. You go on television and say their president should be respected no more than any other men. Ooh.

Speaker 3:          01:06:05       You Know Matt people, people, if you want to see the conditioning, when you watch somebody burner, watch someone burn a flag in front of the wrong person. Yeah, people will freak out. You want to see the conditioning fucking burn a hundred dollar bill in front of people. No, not the patient.

Speaker 4:          01:06:19       There was a story, a new story about a dude who was in front of a Mexican restaurant and he was a Vietnam vet and he was angry because the Mexican restaurant was flying a Mexican flag above and American flag, whatever. Apparently this dude said that that was not legal. So he goes there with a fucking knife, opens up this giant knife and saws the rope on this guy's flag in front of this man's Mexican restaurant. Good man, holds the flags down and cuts old glory free, folds it up properly and takes it with them. And he's like, you will not disrespect this flag. And he's like, he clearly states somewhere, I don't know where it is. Some old asshole who's dead as fuck wrote down on some piece of paper

Speaker 3:          01:07:03       or the old glory. Most be on top. This is the appropriate late of food.

Speaker 4:          01:07:08       America can never be, you know, [inaudible] never be humble. You can't be like the third flag. Yeah. You know, really cool to bat. You want to be on top, be on top Tibet. Who wants to be honest? But in the middle of Ireland, you wanna be in the middle. Okay, we'll just be on the bottom. It's cool who

Speaker 3:          01:07:21       we are. America, that's what I'm talking about there Jo. I'm talking about this make this game of make believe that we're being forced to play. And it seems like the tea party represents the people who most want to hold on to this silly game of make believe. And it's like, you know, I, I, I love this country and the sense that I love the geography of the place I'm living in. I love the cultures here and the people I've met and I really love like a lot of the ways in our culture that um, free dialogue can spring up and all the amazing things. But why are you forcing me to then take that, that love or a sense of like belonging here and put it on a God damn symbol? Why are you making me put that on a fucking flag or on whatever the silly thing is that you're turning into an idol?

Speaker 3:          01:08:04       I don't want to do that any more and more as we get smarter. I think as a, as a species, that kind of stuff is becoming less and less palatable. And, and, uh, because now when we're engaged in these ceremonies, most of us are thinking like, you know, the pledge of allegiance or whatever at a baseball game. I don't even know they do that. A baseball game, I think, I'm not saying everyone, but I think there is a percentage of people in the audience who are doing it out of just a sense of like, oh, it's kind of quaint. I'm going to do it. This is weird, but you want me to put my hand on my chest? You so okay.

Speaker 1:          01:08:36       It was just one of those same reasons why a lot of people want to be Christians and tell you they're Christians because it automatically carries with it a certain amount of respect. And you know, if you say to me, you know, you know, where do you stand with politics? You know how you feel I'm fucking patriot Patriot Bro. I fucking believe in this country. I'm a patriot. And all of sudden like Dang guy is not to be questioned. You know what I'm saying? Right? You mean like that guy has a, there's a certain amount of respect for you, you're going to get from me for being a patriot.

Speaker 3:          01:09:05       Well, no, because I believe in the system and this president was elected and because this president was elected than everything, and I just have to go with what's happening and this I trust my government now. This is a, this is the silliest fucking place to have tea for your mind to get to. When you really look back at the fact that this very same government with the same government that enforced segregation, it was the same government that illegal. You went to war in Vietnam. It was the same government that told us that there was weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction. This very same government that you've pledged your allegiance to again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again throughout history has shown that it does not do the right thing. He consistently does shitty things. Slavery, segregation, now it war, war now, bombs. Now it will repair itself from time to time. And what's really beautiful is the promise of democracy, the promise of democracy or are a truly, I guess what a representative government, a truly representative government is fucking beautiful. Jesus Christ. That's like pure evolution. Okay. A purely

Speaker 1:          01:10:11       representative government have an educated population, a truly educated, not just educated with books and number or you know, numbers and words but educated as far as behavior educated as far as character. There's too many of us to get that done. There's not enough insight. I know that that the, that we are right now, the idea is that there's too many of us and I think that's what this whole, I'm a patriot. I'm a Christian. This is a reason. No, no, no, no, no, no. There's a million good things Brian up anti just what I'm saying. The, the, the, the idea is that being a Christian saying you're a patriots hearing you are, you are trying to hold some higher ideal that you would really like other people to do as well. And if they do do it, you know you're going to treat them better and everyone's going to have more energy together. So this is like, you know, they're trying, it's like when people say like, I'm, I'm a Christian. I'm a, I'm a Christian too. Even though a lot of them don't do anything Christian, you know, the first thing they want to do is fucking shoot the enemy. Yeah. Jesus has turned the other cheek. The last thing you want to do is go and fucking say, I'm a Christian.

Speaker 8:          01:11:14       I'm here to fuck people up. Yeah. You can't say that, man. It's like they're, they're, they're saying it because there is this urge to do it.

Speaker 3:          01:11:20       Yeah. It's fun to imagine Jesus flying the Enola Gay. Like imagine fucking beard. He's got his toe gone or whatever the thing is he's wearing and he's flying that fucking Enola gay did drop a nuclear weapon on a population of children and women and boyfriends and girlfriends and artists that Jesus is like, I must do this from my father. Of course not.

Speaker 8:          01:11:46       Well, I had to get that out, but what did you mean Brian? Like what were you saying?

Speaker 3:          01:11:50       No, I mean it's just like you're saying about how bad the government is, how many bad things they've done, you know, in the past. But everyone never looks at the good shit, you know? And no one's ever looking at all the good shit they do.

Speaker 6:          01:12:00       I don't think that's going to tell him the bad stuff. I don't think that's necessarily the Grand Canyon. It's bad ass. Did you ever read watership down? Government didn't make the grand canyon, Bro. He's a fucking buster bubble. Hey, will you do me a favor of, no, we're not

Speaker 8:          01:12:12       plus to play music, but there's a song that we have to play. We have to play because I really liked the song and it's a super appropriate and we'll just talk over it. Okay. We're not like selling, it's Aaron Lewis country boy. You know the dude from stained. Okay, well he's reinvented himself as a country music singer and yes, yes, yes. I want you to you because it's important. It's really important. It's really important for two reasons. One, because I honestly like the song. I liked the song a lot. I really do. It's a fucking good song. Guys got a great voice. I loved him and that, that band stained and he, yeah, I think he's a bad motherfucker. He's, he's got a great voice and a apparel. It's just so fascinating because it's super, super patriotic song. Cause here it and it's, it's, it's, it's so patriotic. It's like almost like a parody tone from the beginning. From the beginning. Hit it from the beginning. Here we go. Ready? It's about being a country boy that's here. We never play songs anymore, but fuck it man.

Speaker 9:          01:13:10       I love this song. No dirt around it. How do you know? Do the listen, how good his voice. It was probably 1500 bucks back in nine.

Speaker 6:          01:13:21       Man. I don't like sounding like a home. I'll put down, motherfuckers got a bad ass voice. He could talk to me to bed at night with that voice. You're alone.

Speaker 9:          01:13:30       Listen to this change of a man. I don't know what is changing.

Speaker 6:          01:13:44       Vh One gray. This is a great fucking song. Dude.

Speaker 9:          01:13:48       Rarely drink from the bottle, but I'll smoke Gulen

Speaker 6:          01:13:56       concept. He's onsite, man. He has don't tread on me. Tattooed on his neck tense. That's a tense right across his neck. It says, don't tread on me, and this song is talking about how he never leaves his house without his nine or is 45 it's like of gangster rap.

Speaker 9:          01:14:12       It's tried to know the words that come out. La Concha, he sold his soul to the devil in La. This is talking about women's in that other band winger. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:14:32       It's the saying, the devil hooked him up in La with a, like a regular guy. You ever see spinal tap? He's like, what he's doing is he's making up for his time as a Rockstar, a spinal tap. When they sit like there's a great thing where it shows all the pictures of the band and they tried every demographic. They kept changing demographics according to what was popular and to like. He's just swapped demographics like, yeah, you've got race entries. Publicist was like, hey listen. I think, I think the country markets, he's trying to be legit, just like a gangster rappers trying to be legitimate. In the video. There's a picture of him like get to holding a gun. He's two and he's got a gun in his hand. I am not bullshitting. He says me age too. He's holding a gun and there's another picture where he's got a large mouth bass.

Speaker 6:          01:15:15       See I used a fish, you know, so it's like all these pictures of him, but all that shit is like so manipulative and silly and that whole thing, man, it gets way better. I grew up on a country place. You never know the last few seconds of it. I'll tell you Brian, exactly where to go because it's so ridiculous. It was one of my, it's, it's, it's just really interesting cause you know there's a miss hands. No, and it's way worst and Mr. Quota, four minutes and 14 seconds. Go do at a four minutes and 14 seconds. We'll just end this because it's fascinating. By the way, I'm not dissing this guy at all and I fucking love this music and I love, I love his song and I love that kind of music. I like a lot of Toby Keith Song. I don't have anything wrong. A patriotic songs

Speaker 10:         01:15:57       at the end of it. Listen to sky does this little speech, and this is like this old old dude.

Speaker 11:         01:16:02       It's like, I love my country. I love my guns, I love my family. I love the way it is now. And anybody that tried to change it has to come through me. I should be on our head.

Speaker 10:         01:16:13       Jeez, it's, this is America and a country boy was good enough. Okay,

Speaker 6:          01:16:19       play that back again because that might be a terrorist message. Okay. That re retarded. Fucking speech. Back it up, right?

Speaker 10:         01:16:26       Listen, listen, this

Speaker 11:         01:16:31       is that. A bag. Listen, I love my country. I love my guns. I love my family. I love the way it is now. And anybody that tried to change it has to come through me.

Speaker 10:         01:16:43       That's a music or attitude that should be all of our answers. This is America and a cargo is good enough for me.

Speaker 6:          01:16:49       Country boy is good enough for me. Like we are as evolved as I need. Let's stop right here. And he sadly, if you can listen to a cancer cell, just so fucking stupid. It's like a Loma guns. Oh, that's you. Oh, I love my country. I love my guns.

Okay, look, I'm not saying I want to take your guns, dude. I don't want to. I like guns too. I love my family too. All right. Settle the fuck down. Every time it hits price. Every time in history, no one's coming through you bro. But every period in history, he's got those human anchors desperately trying to dig their claws into that fucking into the earth and keep evolution from happening.

Speaker 6:          01:17:42       Desperately. Fight. They'll kill for it. They'll kill for it. What do you mean? Wait a minute. You can't be serious. Do you? Everyone gathered around. Did you hear Galileo? Did you hear what Galileo just said? Father, he said that heard he speak not being, I love my earth in the center of the universe. Earth sticks and bows and arrows. I love, I love Burt's ears. Muscling. I love my slave Vernon, which is trying to take my catapult away. I'll come to me. I love my scroll. I love my car. I love carving and rock. I'll love walking. I don't need to run any horses. I need domesticated animals. That's complicated. But who wants to domesticate horse has got to come through me. I love being a hunter gatherer. I love having a lifespan in a single cell organism.

Speaker 2:          01:18:34       We're all having a good time down here at the bottom of the ocean floor and anybody who wants to change, that's got to come through me. I love being a carbon molecule. I love exists in the pre big bang conditions. Hello, 11 protons. Anybody wants change that as I opened up the second bottle of wine, it's always,

Speaker 6:          01:19:03       yeah, I have a question about it. When you're a beautiful song, man, the guy's just sing his fucking ass off. I'm sorry, I'm not denying it. I'm buying that shit on iTunes right now cause I made funny bro. I love that song. No bullshit. I love and he's a Massachusetts boards. Just like me. When you first, when you first talked about the horse pumping, how many dirt roads or in Massachusetts you called it Mr Hand. Just because you saw the file name Mr has done mpeg. Now was that his name? His name. The guy who got fucked to death was Mr hands. If you don't know what the story we're talking about, we're talking about a real true story about a gentleman in Seattle, I believe. I believe he was an engineer, but he was a professional and he had this crazy fetish for sex with animals and wind up getting killed.

Speaker 6:          01:19:48       And there's a video of him getting fucked by a horse. And the video's Mr [inaudible]. Dot. Amp Peg and you can get it at two guys, one horse.com and then if you're new to the internet or you don't have any fucked up friends like me, you probably, you might not have ever even seen this. It don't. You're right, John, do it. It's not worth it. So we do that to you. So crazy. Watch a guy get fucked by a horse. They were talking about Mr Hands Today. I worked on this horror movie, there's low budget horror movie and they're all talking about Mr hand. They're all calling it, you know, like you know that and Mr hands died mpeg or whatever. And then they were saying that there's a Mrs hands and really Oh yeah mrs his is even worse. Cause he described it where it was the woman's face is off the side of the thing and the horse, it was just fucking come and say it pulls out and just floppy Dick and calm and everything.

Speaker 6:          01:20:34       And the girl at one point is Glenn. Oh yeah. You know like it changes. That's old. That's not actually misses hands. They just called it. It's a marketing. Yeah. There was a dude named Billy Billy Connolly. I fucking wash it over his house while someone's stood guard over the front door. We were in the basement and what one of us had to stand guard by the front door that were in the basement that would go up the stairs and stand by the door. And if you hear my fucking mom better say something. This is Billy saying cause it's apparently maybe his mom either caught him with it or didn't know he had it. But there was some issue cause it was, it was called barnyard better. Yes. Vhs. And then you could barely see what the fuck was going on. It was really shitty quality. But that's one of the scenes.

Speaker 6:          01:21:14       The horse shoots a load all over her and she makes these moans like Oh yeah and it's so disturbing. It was like almost like I got molested that day because the, the, the day is literally like broken up in my memory with these jolting one, the standout memories. Like you know how you scroll through your icons if you're a a Mac and you scroll through and then they get larger when your cursor goes over the thing. Like that's what those memories are. And it's like, like the whole day is like a normal day. No memory of the day at all. So growing up fuck by a horse and Billy Connolly's basement, I gotta tell you something, man, I don't think there is a comparison between a girl getting hoarse, calm, blasted all over. And a guy getting impaled to death on the penis of a horse. Those are two different things.

Speaker 6:          01:22:02       We didn't have died from getting fucked by horses. Many people have got it. Sam, this woman who was a some, God damn. Who the hell was queen there? My memory sucks.

Speaker 12:         01:26:06       Yeah, little hobos back, but he's smaller. I ordered the wrong God damn size. I think it's funnier.

Speaker 8:          01:26:12       Could he tell the story? Dude? How big is it? How big is a little Hobo? I don't know. He's like this big and that's even better. It might be better. First of all, it's easy to carry him and second of all it's even creepier than a tiny little dog is going to kill you if you want to do it in New Orleans, but I don't think it'll work on fuck it. It's not going to work. You must do it. It's too small. It's like a tiny little dog. Oh, that's the picture of what's going to the head. It's pretty

Speaker 12:         01:26:33       funny and the whole time I'm laying there while she's up at me, I'm just looking up her pussy. How I'm sure fucking made. Her eyes are like look like scary monster liquor. Just still blue. They're the most beautiful geysers

Speaker 8:          01:26:47       keep talking. I'm saying you notify, but she's married to a black wasn't as long as what? A black, white and that's K and she's married to another porn star. Oh, how's that work there? They allowed the only bank people on camera. This is, we had Dana DRM on. Don wants, it was very cool check, but she was talking about her relationship relationship. She was in ones where she had a, a relationship with a porn star, but they were only allowed to bank other people in movies and she caught him bag at other people outside of the movies and she was mad. How dare you, we do a bench. I'm Morgan. I'd be working all day. That was, that was like a total loophole in marriages. Every man would be a porn star. We'd all be like, I got to, I'm like, I'm still, I said, how many times are tough? Okay, it's a bad economy. I'm going to pick up a little money on the side. Fucking checks on film.

Speaker 12:         01:27:37       Yeah, man. It's still embarrassed. I mean that's one of the other things about being human. It's like, you know, you're just trapped in these fucking awful primate monogamy patterns and it's just like embarrassing. You get jealous or weird and all that shit's embarrassing. It's like the whole situation, like we're still stuck in this really primitive way of living and we can't get out of it.

Speaker 8:          01:27:58       That's what it is, is we're becoming aware that it's silly. Whereas for the majority of existence, it was just accepted and it wasn't what it was. And it was what made you feel good? What makes you feel good to conquer your enemy? You know, it's like Conan, what does best in life? What is that, uh, to crush your enemies, to see them driven before you and they hear the laminations of the women. I know. And he had this, uh, you know, and I mean, but that's what it was, man, man, fucking ancient Sumeria or some area, whatever the fuck you was from. That's what it was about. Right. You know, and that's, that's whatever supposedly, you know, it's a fake world, but we're, we're thinking he lived 6,000 years ago, 7,000 years ago that some people did. And then there was, it wasn't a lot going on.

Speaker 8:          01:28:35       I like the first two, but the third, it's like, I don't want to hear it. All the commands. I don't want to hear the limitations. I don't mind like crushing when you hear them go laminations screaming because you're fucking getting raped by his limitations cause he, you know, he says it wasn't like he, it's a word that I've never used ever. Yeah. It's moaning, screaming cause you use this word by the way, you're a douchebag. Mentations use that word. That word. You should hear my wife laminating now. Is it limitating oh, there's some weird thing about the Jewish Prophet Jeremiah. Are you sure this is the same thing? Pretty sure. What definition? Isn't it like a nurse or I went to with a Bible.

Speaker 8:          01:29:20       Hmm. The act of laminating and that's the worst definition. Pressure. Sorrow. A cry of sorrow or grief and lemon. Asians as the women are crying until, until you start because they're getting raped. No, no. The men are getting killed. The Cross. Do you see them? The Mongols and the Mongols would fucking ride in and it was just, you would sack a village and then you would rape the women. Are you saying that Conan was based on the Mongols? I think so. I think they drew a lot from it. Cause this was day bro. It's Robert, he Howard, he didn't know about her book and I know he committed suicide and I used to have the fucking poem he wrote when he got suicide. He's to have it memorized. I can't remember it now. Yeah. Did you ever read any of the old Conan's fuck yeah dude.

Speaker 8:          01:30:03       Fuck yes. Things got me through a depressing high school. Yeah, I love, I'm so bummed that apparently the new movie sucks cause I was like really looking forward to, I really wanted to see it. I love those dudes. Well I met the guard too. He came to the UFC once and he was, uh, I was Kinda glad that I didn't get a half to interview him cause he was kind of going crazy and I don't know how I would've reacted to it. It was not going crazy in the bathroom. It was all psych because Chris leaving wall and he's all pumped up and everything. The Goldberg is like, you know, Mister professional well all. Tell us about this movie Conan. You know, Goldberg is like, he's like a super professional play by play broadcaster guys, so he can interview somebody if he knew nothing about them.

Speaker 8:          01:30:42       When I interview somebody, if I know nothing about them, I feel weird. Right? But this guy is the perfect Conan. You know people are giving him shit because they don't like the fact that he's pretty, they don't like people don't like fucking six foot four beautiful man sculpted bodies and game of Thrones, right? Yeah. He's great and fucking game of Thrones and he have been good. This movie is a piece of shit. He's a good culture and he, there's, there's, there's scenes where he's fighting as Conan that are bad fucking ass. There was, he's fighting with these things that are made out of sand and he's like sand monsters and the way he moves around, I'm like this, you nailed it. That's Robert Howard's Kona. That's it. This guy just needs like he needs, first of all, you need a singular vision. You need a guy who's a brilliant writer, who's a Robert Howard fan.

Speaker 8:          01:31:27       Go for it. Create the whole thing. But there's scenes where it's just like so preposterous. They were so dumb. This the final scene with him and his antagonist is like one of the dumbest scenes in any action movie ever. It's almost like they slapped it together in 10 minutes and filmed it with an iPhone. It's so why do they do that? Because there's a bunch of people that want to get their fucking greedy little pause on things. There's a bunch of different producers, a bunch of different executives, a bunch of different people, and they all have their own vision of how it should work. This guy, Jason Momoa is an unknown actor, fairly unknown. At least carry such a gigantic franchise. It's a $90 million fund

Speaker 1:          01:32:03       vestments for the studio and all these assholes want to stick their dirty fingers in it and I've seen it, man. I watched in a fucking movie contagion. There was a movie I did called Frank mccloskey. CII and I have talked about it once before that I did this movie and I watched this kid who was a really funny kid. Frank, I should say his name. It's Dave something. Frank McCluskey. See, let me look it up just to give this kid props. He was a fucking really funny comedian man. He's like, I was watching them, Dave Sheridan, I was watching him like his adlibs. I was watching his, the way he performs, he was like really over the top almost Jim Carrey in uh, ace Ventura ash. Right. And there was a guy who was on the set who was an executive and um, I don't know what production company film that.

Speaker 1:          01:32:54       I was barely paying attention to any of that shit back then. But this guy had the Rolex on and a super expensive suit with suspenders and cufflinks. I mean this is a fucking, this was a baller. This was some guy who had made a bunch of big, big movies already and made a ton of money and was dressing on this movie set in a way that I'd really never seen anybody addressing the movie. Said it was to me it was ridiculous. And he's wearing this ridiculous, it was so obvious. He had a ton of money and he was giving this kid line readings. This kid was doing his scene and the kid would do the scene and he would go, okay, okay, okay. Instead of that, how about this?

Speaker 8:          01:33:33       But you walk in, you step one foot on the floor, your throw your legs up in the, he, he, he made it himself. He did his own little interpretation of what he thought would be awesome and the scene. And I was like, God damn here is ego one, a mock, some completely uncreative fuck head wearing. Cufflinks is telling this really funny kid. What, what to do. And I was watching it a road right before my eyes. I was watching what was like a really funny script and it really zany kind of silly actor. I was like, oh, it's kind of fun. And I watched them poison it or watched them like stick their dirty fingers. And that's what Conan's smelled like. Conan smelled like one guy thought we could do it right and we could recreate robbery, Howard's version of Conan and we could have, you know, fucking monsters and sorcery and all kinds of crazy shit that he fights again.

Speaker 8:          01:34:27       We could do this. This could be fucking wild and studio is like, we're in. We got chasing Mamoa from the game of Thrones. Look at him. He's six foot five. He's a fucking male model. He's built like Hercules. This guy's Conan. He is Kona. I want you to meet him. I am Kona. He's fucking Conan. They get all fired up. They do lines and then they start rewriting the script. The executive say they like, these guys don't fucking movies like I know fucking movies. I produced 25 fucking movies and they start getting their dirty little stinky, TJ's covered paws all over that script and they start fucking drop and rocks out of the fucking

Speaker 12:         01:34:58       nose on key words that they blow it. But that's when, when people, or not to get back to the idea where it's totally different scenarios. This is just for entertainment purposes folks. Please also mean I enjoyed the thing we were talking about at the beginning about, you know, when people are used to free entertainment, you know, they want it to stay free. And you know, a lot of people when they watch NBC or ABC or CBS or any of these shows, they think they're getting free entertainment, but they're not getting free entertainment. They're getting, they're paying with their attention on the advertisements, but more than that, they're paying in the form of getting diluted entertainment. They're getting shit. It's got, it's that thing that you just described. Every show on a network has had almost every show has had that exact same thing applied to it and so many different ways because the executives want to sell and a depressants or they want to sell Chevrolets or whatever the fuck they're advertising on the show.

Speaker 12:         01:35:54       So you, have you ever had this experience personally where shit got diluted. My one experience with a show that didn't get picked up by comedy central, weirdly, because I was prepared for this. I was like, they're going, they're going to comedy central. Ruined my vision and not the first round. And notes that came back was awesome. It was great notes. Really smart. It was like, it made the, the, the notes made sense. There wasn't any kind of weird like, Oh yes, wait, no, no, no. I did have it happen. I did have it happen when I made some stuff for fuel TV for this show called stupid face. And uh, uh, that, that's where we made our galaxy cabin log cabin. And Jodie is living in someone's, yeah, please explain how ridiculous it is. What it was Julie Diaz doing well, this lead of fishermen. Well, the story was about, I played at mountain man and my friend Brian Jarvis played a space captain and something had happened where he'd gotten sucked into a black hole and a flood.

Speaker 12:         01:36:50       It sucked my cabin to a black hole at the same time. And now we fly through space in this cabin and we're just idiots. And like it is the stupidest, I wish we'd had a bigger budget though magazine. It's such a funny idea. So stupid. I wish to give us more money. I know cause we had no budget for the thing. We had like a green screen. So Joey Diaz is episode was we're like in the cabin and um, my grandfather comes like knocks on the door of the cabin and space and I'm like, granddaddy, I thought you were dead. And he's like, Bree wants might the space commanders ring. He's like, let me see your friends ring there. And my friends like, I'm not sure this is your grandfather red. And then basically it was an alien living in the neck, my dead grandfather and alien living in the neck and that was showing him and he was called the fishermen and he was in a rain slicker and it was small bodies floating on a canoe. Joey Diaz nailed is, have you ever had children and you and your wife were getting divorced? She would

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       bring that fucking video to add to a court, say this is the kind of shit I got to deal with.

Speaker 12:         01:38:05       If you know, that's another thing to fight for the kids. No, you win. You get the kids, you can keep them.

Speaker 4:          01:38:10       Oh well you don't want him. And once you become attached to the kids, if your wife is crazy, he comes a real issue with people. Or if you feel like your wife is going to lie and turn your kids on you, that's what a lot of men think. A lot of men are worried. I wonder why they think that. Well, listen man, when someone fucking hates you and they talk shit about you all day, that's a terrible thing. If you go over as a nurse, you know your, your mom's house, your mom is just constantly talking Shit about your dad and you go to your Dad's house, your dad's constantly talking shit about your mom. It's like Jesus Christ. How the fuck am I ever going to have a normal relationship at five you dumb cunts. Yeah. Fuck heads don't even know how to get along civilly outside of your fuck time. You know you stop fucking and now you hate each other. You have kids, you don't want to be together. Get, get, grow bro. The fuck up. You got a kid dummy.

Speaker 12:         01:38:52       Yeah. Well, you know, man, the the problem, the thing about that Shit, man, is that, well, the thing I'm realizing is there as a fucking shitty network executive in everyone's life are most people's lives. It's like that shit doesn't just stop at the network.

Speaker 4:          01:39:06       Nah, dude. Most people have bosses. These are way, way, way, way worse and shitty network executives because if even if you've got a shitty network executive, you're on fucking TV too. All right. You got a television show. You're doing something wild and crazy that very few people ever get to do. Yeah. I've dealt with network executives when we did the man show, we got fucked. Doug and I both get fucked. It was a disaster and I watched other people get fucked. When I was doing news radio, I watched the influence I've seen. I've seen things that could have been really good, get fucked with combat or when people don't believe in things because the ratings are not good. All of a sudden they want to bring in people. They want to bring in man and bring in women and hot chicks and we're going to mix this up in a network, has all their nutty fucking ideas.

Speaker 4:          01:39:50       How to tune things up and make them more exciting. It's gross. It's annoying as fuck, man. What they're supposed to do is promote the shit out of the show and if it's not good, if it doesn't get good ratings, just cancel that piece of shit. Sell it, don't smell it. Don't. What you don't want to do is get a bunch of network executives who are generally or uncreative people influencing creative piece. Sure. W the creative people, either they do it or they don't do it. Either it works or it doesn't work. That's what I take. But wouldn't do an executive start

Speaker 12:         01:40:17       digging in. Very few know what they're doing. It's very few. Very few know creatively. Yeah, it's, it's like like the time when we are doing stupid face that the guy we, oh, here's the weird thing that executive are like, there are two guys here are these skateboarders named Ted and Laban or the main producers and they're awesome. Just crazy. Awesome, brilliant guys. Then above them was this guy did, they had to pass everything through and he would give the most random shitty notes about stuff that you would do. And I was like notes that were impossible to do it to address, you know, like

Speaker 3:          01:40:53       not specific notes like I'm trying to think of like, so we know like to on notes, like, you know, this was good, but it would be better if we could make it more laughy. Whoa. You know what I mean? Like kind of ambiguous notes were like, well what? How do I make something black coffee or more like, you know what I mean? There's like, do you mean fun z? What, what are your specific problems with it? But that was the one experience I had with that. But, but I have obviously heard shitloads of people having these problems. It's kind of like remembering, you weren't when you were in reading class, when you're learning to read as a kid and you'd sit in a circle and you'd read. Yeah. And there was always that kid who slowed the whole thing down. It would get to that one kid who's like there is right. You know, and you knew how to read. You are, you know, you can read pretty fast, but the whole fucking thing, lunch was being fucking push back. Cause this one thing when the same way those people insert themselves into power positions, right. And they'll put themselves into like creative power positions or they're everywhere. They're in fee even affected everything. But now they have power. Imagine if the kid got his,

Speaker 4:          01:41:55       let me tell you something that's an, that's an unrealistic characterization because it's very fucking difficult to become a neck network executive. Right? Most of them.

Speaker 3:          01:42:04       No, I don't mean that kitty. We know. I don't mean they can't read. I mean there are like that for creativity. I'm saying their skill level for creativity. The same as the kid who can't read or write. But I thought you were talking about those people. No, no. Hopefully those people learn to read

Speaker 4:          01:42:17       z Z. I think it's an ego thing entirely. I think they become successful and successful people think they're good at everything. That's why people who were successful at one thing don't like learning other things. You know, one of the biggest problems in mixed martial arts fighters is people who have a specialty and don't want to learn another specialty. You become, yeah, they become very, very one dimensional. There's a lot of fighters like that where they're really good kickboxers and they never learned how to wrestle or do Jiu Jitsu. Good. Yeah, no, it's terrible. It's terrible for them. And the problem is they're not willing to be a novice. There's so good at that one thing that that's the thing they want to train all the time because they're so good. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:42:50       But whenever you see how he's just someone just showing me this website for this actress and it's her resume and it's like director, actor, producer, writer. There was like seven things that she said she was and it was like, Oh God could give me a fucking break. And then like that she had quotes, you know, like referenced to it of Healer. That shit. Yeah. It's like, you know, when you in spiritual guy and some people do it, some people do it, some people like we'll have like nine things going at once. But I always, there's something I respect and people who are just focused on this one thing, like just start, there are a writer. That's what they do, right? They just, right. I think that's cool. Well, it'd

Speaker 4:          01:43:30       be in a comic, you know, I mean, I do a lot of other shit besides comedy. Like, uh, I do the UFC and, and do other things. So what I've managed to do is be professional, a professional. Me, I'm, I'm me professionally. So that's, that's what, and so I put me in certain situations, I put me in a situation where there's some fights going on and have to explain what's on in a way

Speaker 8:          01:43:52       that people are gonna think it's entertaining and ingest that. And then there's other me where I'm going on a stage in front of a bunch of people and I, I, I'm going to say things in a certain way that's gonna make them laugh. Or I'm me and I'm talking on the Internet. And the podcast, you know, or um, me and getting people to do something fucked up on fear factor. I just, I'm a professional meet. What's that? Talk about that thing. Oh yeah. I wish I could too, but I cannot sir. Yes. Photos or something you can't talk about on his phone will be able to talk about it eventually. It's, it's insane. Oh, it's terrible. It's terrible. It's amazing. It's amazing. The difference between 2002 fear factor in 2011 fear factor. It's just like, Oh yes. That's exactly what happened. The Internet, no question about it has changed our, our line in the sand.

Speaker 8:          01:44:41       It reminds me of when rap turned in to gangster rap. Remember that transition? This is way crazier than that dude. I mean hip hop, but to the hippity hip hop too, like some Nwa or something like that's terrible. Yeah, exactly. It's terrible. It is. By the way, when I was, when you were taught, just talking about it is always drinking the coconut water. I gagged. I'm immune. I was right there. And not only was I right there, I was right there while there was people vomiting and nothing. I'm immune to vomit. It's crazy man. My little baby threw up in the bed the other night and uh, you know, it's sad. You know, she was okay. She just sometimes kids that cough while they have food in their mouth and he'd just throw out all the fuck. Yeah. But cats are gross to throw up so much because they lift their hair, man, the lick, their own hair.

Speaker 8:          01:45:32       That's one reason they either they have to throw up those, those hairballs and sometimes they get food. She throws up every three times a week, three, four times a week. My female, my mail doesn't throw up. And you know what else I've done. I started bringing them to the groomer, which is great for them cause it's hot as fuck out here in California. And so I don't let him out. I do let him out in the courtyard sometimes, but outdoor cats, I believe that cats should be free. And I've had outdoor cats in my life and I believe that's the best way for cats, but I'm terrified of that fucking toxo plasma shit. You know? You can say that. That's ridiculous, but if you, if you read about it, I might have it to him. You got to talk to me. A microphone, homeboy. You got to talk.

Speaker 8:          01:46:11       Anybody 100% serious that I will take a test. We should all take a to put your headphones on. You think you have it? No, I don't think I have it, but I think we definitely need to take a text. I think we should do it on the show. Yeah, you're right. I think Joey Diaz, how's it by the way? You can. You can have it and be a healthy version. It just affects your judgment apparently or has a effect. Look, if you're slightly cranky, that also affects your judgment. You know, there's a lot of things that affect your judgment if you haven't gotten enough sleep. If you're in a bad relationship, there's things that affect your judge. I know I've got it. I fucking change so many bags of cat litter. When I was like, breathing in that shit is probably

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       not to worry because it's not. I worry because I've had feral cats. I had,

Speaker 12:         01:46:55       wow. I did too. I captured six kittens, brought him back to my apartment. Oh, we both have feral kittens. I'm festering. Came around by their neck on by your mouth. I caught him in a box. I caught him in a box and a construction site and they were assholes. Man. I wish I'd never done it.

Speaker 4:          01:47:12       Well, they're scared of people, but they will bond to one person and really, really be attached to my account was super attached to me, but terrified of everybody else. Ma'Am

Speaker 12:         01:47:19       have cats. What? Why? Because I was an idiot. You've got to have a lot of responsibility. Yeah. Pet cats are like, hey, it's easier than a fucking Hams. People don't understand more responsibility than a plant. Yes. And, and also, and also depending on your conditioning, some people, some people raise other people to think that cats are like one step above like a steak. Like people don't, a lot of people don't, they don't have animal empathy, so they're really shitty with their animals. Like when you drive by someone's porch and they've got a dog. I'm like a tiny little chain and I think that's normal. People think that's normal or people only like walk their dogs for or do dogs who don't have a backyard. People only walk. Their dogs are like five minutes a day. Like you can't do that. You'd have to, you got a dog, you have to walk your dog like 45 minutes. What ever you should aids walking.

Speaker 4:          01:48:12       What do you mean you should if you don't have a big yard or are you just should no matter what.

Speaker 12:         01:48:15       Well, I mean for what it's worth, that's what the doc whisperer sad. He said dogs need like a 45 minute. I remember different breeds on these Pekinese. My dog loves it. That's the point. My dog loves a good long walk. It's clearly like he wants to be cooped up in a fucking house all day.

Speaker 4:          01:48:32       My dog. That's totally true. I hope I have a one solution when my dogs, I have a giant yard that I have a yard for my dogs only. That's a full acre wooded saw pine trees all day. They're just fucking chasing squirrels and having a party up there. Fine. Yeah. But I, I bought this place specifically because it had this big lock right next to it and I knew that I'd keep my dogs then. Yeah. You know, I feel like if you have dogs, man, you have a responsibility to give those dogs like a fun environment. Totally. You know, like my dogs are happy as fuck you come to your mind dogs, they're wagging their tail and shit. They're never like freaking out. They're stuck in this yard, their yard. She huge, you know, it's a full acre.

Speaker 12:         01:49:08       Yeah. Yeah. I think I've basically transformed my dog and down monkey. My dogs turned into something more than a dog because I treat you, I treat my dog like a person and I feel like my dog understands that. I think that dogs can become like these amazing creatures if you give them enough love. Sure that people are dumb and they don't get that and so they like give him some dry food and water and let them lay on the couch. I'll fucking day it says it doesn't want to do that. They want walks, man. If your dog doesn't want attention, they want attention and he wants to simulation and they want to be outside. Yes, they need the outside. They need the air, they need this. The squirrels.

Speaker 4:          01:49:45       Oh guys really loved it when we lived in Colorado because we lived in Colorado, they were just roam free. You know, I was on 148 acres in the mountains so I didn't have a fence. I just let them outside at night. What I did was we were there every day for weeks and we let them know this is where everybody lives. Okay, this is where we live now. And they figured it out really quick and I just did it totally natural style. I just, you know, walked him with me and I took them with me on walks. We, we know we scattered up perimeter. They got ahead of me sometimes, but when they got ahead of me, they always went right back to the house if we lost them. It was pretty interesting until the dog got emailed the mountain mine of course. Cheers. Cheers.

Speaker 6:          01:50:18       Frankie Harris and drinking game. You have to just bring up the traumatic story. It's my little buddy.

Speaker 4:          01:50:30       It's a sad story. Did you hear about this fucking shit about lifelike cells made of metal that they've, they've figured out a way and then they're theorizing now that there might be living things out there in the university evolve from metal. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:50:45       Like fucking terminator type Shit. Yeah, of course. Yeah. That, I mean, what the fuck man? That's the same thing like people thinking that let light it has to be water and times that's the, isn't that the same thing as thinking that the earth is in the center of the fucking universe? It's the same silly idea. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:51:03       The scientists said, listen to this statement, I am 100% positive that we can get evolution to work outside organic biology. How funky boy fucking scary is that. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:51:16       totally. That's what the article says. It's probably like that monkey boy from the old son TV or the national enquirer. The screaming monkey boy, monkey boy says Mr. Sign.

Speaker 4:          01:51:25       Just fellow. He's from, his name was Lee Cronin.

Speaker 6:          01:51:30       So what do you have to be to be a scientist? Can do you have to go to school work and you just like three times things and call yourself a sign. That's an interesting point. I think. You think you have to have some sort of a degree to be taken seriously? You can your mom right you the degree and say from her knowledge and her backyard, you

Speaker 4:          01:51:42       silly goose. This guy's from the University of Glasgow. He's from Scotland and his building blocks are largely, oh Jesus. Say this word. Poly Ox. So, but tell a ox Pauline [inaudible]. Oh, you mean poly ox and metallic? Oh yes. I mean poly oxo met towel. Yes. That's, it may have a range of metal atoms. Mostly tungsten linked to oxygen and phosphorous. By simply mixing them in a solution, he can get them to self assemble into cell likes. Fears. Whoa. That's called. Could you imagine if we fucking showed up on some planet somewhere? And they really were like maximum crime. They were like the transformers. What about transformers were real, man, this, this, they should have released this. If they released this just six months or six weeks rather before the transformers movie came out and they can have this information along with their teasers. It can be a more exciting movie for me because I'd be like, maybe it's not so preposterous. And these big stupid cars,

Speaker 8:          01:52:46       com people saving robots, I think give a fucking flying shit about people, Dude. I, what about the sun? I mean, maybe the son's alive. That's it. That to me it's like why God, why think about other planets. You have this source of all life on this planet, the main energy source for all life on this planet outside of things that are getting it from like a steam vents that they brought him in the sea. Uh, things that are living in thermal ducks or whatever. I'll do, I'll go you one further please. We're made out of stars. We're literally, every fucking is single piece of your body is stardust. Yeah. I mean that that is what happened to human biology is a direct result of fucking son's blowing up. That's right. That's the only way you get the information to make human beings or the, the, the, the materials. It's so incredible that it, yeah, it sounds ridiculous. Stuff like a kitty Roger's song. We're like retarded.

Speaker 6:          01:53:42       No, not just kidding. Dot. Katie Rogers, he log book, but Kenny Loggins. No, it sounds like the, the fucking, the highway men. That was a highway man. Yeah. Costa goes calls. Where does it match and pistol grandmas. God, I love that song. It's a great song, man. When Johnny Cash comes on, I ride a star ship cross the also university of eyes and when I reached here, if you haven't seen, it's a, it's a song. The highway men. It's about real good up Brian. We're, we already violated. Our music is great and this is what happens when we get drunk. That's one. He opened herself up to get sued. Aaron Lewis, please don't sue me or you think you're fucking music's awesome. I love it too,

Speaker 2:          01:54:26       son. I'm officially hammer. I've got blood

Speaker 6:          01:54:30       is to drink it too much. We're stones. We're drinking wine. I'm on. Ion is fucked up. I ate so much fake, but today I think I might shit out and living in that water. What's it made out of? I don't know. But they said not to drink it, but they were squirting it in my face. Right. I drank it. Wow. They said not to drink it, but you're dragging your swipe. Clever. Cheers. Cheers. My little retard buddy. Yeah. You're not a retard retired. Your only play one on the podcast. It's awesome.

Speaker 6:          01:55:02       So I understand going on, Ari Shaffir I was going to branch out on his own and have iTunes. He just wanted to, to frank was frequently. And when you're doing it well, he also wants you to do it. He's he, you know, it's hard to do. Uh, you know, your, your podcast is getting super popular. You've got so many people that are doing it. If you don't know, Brian has a whole network of podcasts on iTunes called desk squad, and it's with a bunch of great comics. There's Sam Tripoli, he's got a podcast and now John Reap and John Heffron, our buddies are, are, are doing a podcast and Tom Segura and his wife are doing a podcast. Sam Tripoli's doing a podcast. Did I miss anybody? Uh, low Esther once in a while does wine Brody does when he's, when he's feeling good. And I love how you phrase that. Know they just had Steve

Speaker 8:          01:55:44       O on and they've had a bunch of really good ones the day before that Mike Tyson and him ran into each other at their face. And then you didn't hear what happened at the roads and Charlie Sheen roast. Now I don't, this is just, I heard from word of word of word internet or know of people. I heard that. Is it on the Internet? Did you search? They just recorded it Saturday supposedly a Steevo as Mike Tyson. If he could run into his fist with his face. And when he, when he did it, he broke his nose and he has a picture on his, on Steve O's on Twitter with two black eyes. By the way, Steven wants to come on this podcast. So those are how much he loves you. So are you talking about, we've got to do Judah Friedlander is gonna come on to my buddy Judah contact. He's hilarious.

Speaker 8:          01:56:29       And I'm Max Kellerman who is the, uh, HBO boxing analysts. My personal favorite boxing analyst. I'm next to Jim Lampley who's also those two guys together on my two favorite boxing analysts. You know, a lot of people think that because I do the commentary for the UFC that I don't like boxing. I'm a, I am a gigantic boxing fan. I've been my whole life ever since I was a little kid and remain, and by the way, so is Dana White, the president of the NFC. He's a fucking huge, huge, huge boxing fan. He bets ridiculous amounts of money on pack, you know, fights on Floyd Mayweather fights. He's a fucking huge fan. But Max Kellerman is, we're both fans of Max and he's cool as fuck. He's a really interesting guy. And he used to be a rapper, so it's going to be, he's a white guy too. And he used, he used to be a rapper and he's really coolest fucking, he's going to be on the podcast too.

Speaker 8:          01:57:20       But Judah Friedlander and Graham Hancock, we're going to work out Graham Hancock and the way this is going to work, Brian's, we're going to have to do it probably most likely in Irvine because he's doing some seminars down there and he only has like one day off and I felt bad that it was to drive all the way the fucking bad ass spot at the Irvine. Yeah, we're going to do as well. I want to, what I want to do is we're going to have to talk after the show. We're going to have to figure out a way to make the ship mobile cause there's some people that might need to come see for the lavender hour has just innovated a mobile podcast kit and I'm sure he'd help you guys out and it's got a laptop. But no, it would be what? I want it to equipment. He's like this kid's a sound engineer.

Speaker 8:          01:57:59       He went to college. Well listen, this guy's a sound engineer. We should listen to him. The fuck burn anyway, so we'll, we'll do that, but the bottom line is that we're going to go to Irvine and we're going to talk to Graham and see if we can make sure that this happens. But Graham Hancock emailed me out of the blue. It was one of the fucking coolest things in my life. If you don't want the coolest thing so far of this whole thing, this whole, how about this? The coolest thing of my entire show Biz experience right up there with my spike TV special, which is my favorite special is Anthony Bordain doing the podcast. That was pretty crazy. That was pretty the room. That was cool as fuck. I would definitely get star struck, but the next coolest thing and may be even cooler if it's possible, is this Graham Hancock

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       interview. Because if you don't know who Graham Hancock is, I want you to go and research fingerprints of the gods if you're so inclined, if you're interested in this, but what a fascinating guy who's basically dedicated his whole life to the very controversial and unpopular idea that human beings have been around perhaps far longer in this advanced state of civilization that we currently enjoy. Then we give credit to and then the fact there's been some huge ups and downs throughout history and it's not simply one straight path from caveman to Wifi and that along the way there's been some disasters and that this can be clearly it. I wouldn't say that it can be proven, but what I can say is enough evidence can be brought forth that makes you completely questioned the current ideas of the timelines of human history and this guy, Graham Hancock is responsible from his book, fingerprints of the Gods completely changing the way I look at at civilization.

Speaker 1:          01:59:41       Do you, did you send me where you, the one who sent me the fucking video of that Mayan Pyramids, they just found in Guatemala the single largest pyramid by volume on earth. And it was covered in jungle. They didn't even know it existed. Not only that, but it has a, you know, when, when the, when the Spanish came and when the, uh, the Mayans were conquered, you know, and you know, in different parts of, uh, you know, uh, South America, you know, diff, obviously there were different things happened, but, um, the one of the things was a big issue was the, the mind creation story was a, was changed and altered and fucked up and broken up. And it's, it's very hard to find, uh, an unedited mine creation story. The pub view it's called, but they found this and it's an, it's, it's [inaudible] unedited and it's amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:00:31       And they're, they're going to work on, on, on, on translate again. Now anyone in it before, like, does it look like people who know? Not only that, not only they're not in it. It was completely covered. I mean, I'm sure some local people were aware of its existence because you know when you, you know, you stand, you walk around on there and all of a sudden you're like, what is this? We'll dig a little, oh, it's a giant fucking perfectly hewn rock. There's four feet wide and two feet tall. Well obviously this didn't just happen. You know, somebody made this, who made this, they just didn't know that this mountain, you know, there's, there's, they say that there's thousands of these that they haven't discovered, which is so mind boggling until you look at the geography of South America or if you take into a comp.

Speaker 1:          02:01:12       Yeah, Google maps. But if you take into account the size of North America, South America, look at Mexico. Look at like how, how, how much land you're talking about and how much of it is jungle. No, they've found there was a documentary that I was watching on Egypt where they were, or excuse me, on the Amazon, rather whether we're talking about all these different structures that they're finding in the jungles of civilization, that they have no idea how this civilization got there. Don't know who they were dumped on, what their origins were. Origins were, but they're looking at aqua docs, they're looking at roads, they're looking at all this shit that's just run over by the jungle. And the reality is, man, if you have a fucking house and you put this giant stone house in the middle of the Amazon a hundred years from now, that mother fucker is going to be covered with [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         02:01:56       tree. Yeah, man, there's a documentary. I know, we claim it. There's a document or a Netflix you can watch now. I can't remember the name of it, but I'm taking these fucking Alpha brain pills. You take it on backwards. I Google it, but I mean, what is it about, so what it's about is this side. Yeah, it's an explorer who was searching for this a theme, the last city that existed in the middle of the Amazon. It might be that pyramid that they found. He was looking for it based on like some old scrolls in this like library that he found and he was like a theosophist cause the theosophists. We're really into this idea that there's still existed, advanced civilizations on this planet that had closed themselves off to the rest of human society. And he thought you would find a place where people were still living there, but he went down into the Amazon and just basically vanished.

Speaker 12:         02:02:44       Save the secrets of the dead last Amazon. Yeah. Be a PBS documentary that's on Netflix called the secrets of the dead set out to find the fabled lost city of z. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. And, and the Amazon in 1925. Yeah. It led to a mysterious disappearance was actually a movie. It's a, it's a, it's an, it's a drama. There's a documentary too. Oh wait, no, it is a document. I'm sorry, the late Liev Schreiber is apparently the, um, I looked at that author, I mean, or that actor, I assumed that he was an actor. He's actually the narrator of it. Yeah. But there, it was like a big news story because he was a famous explorer that vanished. And it was weird that you would have watched that shit tonight. It's really fucking cool, man. But they, you know, he thought that they would, there would actually be people living there who were, who would give him like it was a mystical quest for him. Like he really thought that there was going to be this advanced civilization is still in existence. There was somehow going to transmit this information to him, which some people still believe, you know, there's like the hollow earth theory, the idea that like the Shambala exists in the Arctic. If you ever seen that shit no. That you've never seen like in the North Pole, the ideas

Speaker 1:          02:03:51       hold on a second. This secrets of the dead. Apparently it's a whole series. Oh Shit. Bunch of them. And they're available online secrets of the dead. China's terracotta warrior. You, me, and you know what that is? Yeah. Well they found these fucking, this army of terracotta soldiers like buried for thousands of years or however long it was, secrets of dead. Her kilania uncovered. I don't know what that is. Secrets of the dead silver pharaoh, secrets of dead world's biggest bomb secrets or the dead, the Dead Sea Scrolls. One Star on Amazon dog. It can't be too good sequence. You get one star. No, no. Churchill's deadly decision is got four stars maybe that maybe has the same sort of lost in the Amazon only has two stars. I wasn't the, well you

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       know what man, who knows? One customer review. Maybe you got one current who reviewed it and didn't like it. But um, anyway, the point is that these, uh, this, this discovery in Guatemala, I believe they discovered it in 2009. Um, and it's just sort of being publicized today and it made its way through Twitter. But somebody said to me on Twitter when I retweeted it or wherever the hell happened, he said, this is from 2009. I'm like, you know, he's like, just old shit. The Guy said this old shed. I'm like, oh my God, there's 24 months ago. We're talking about some shit that's been buried without human beings ever finding it for fucking thousands of years. No one knew it was there. You know, the, the unedited Mayan creation story.

Speaker 12:         02:05:18       Do they still have, she stole my voice on Netflix not to change the subject. And what is that? It's a documentary about lesbian rape. I recommend Grand Canyon. It's like lesbians raping each other. They, oh, no way. Yeah. They like lesbians rape each other. Will they just fucking forced scissors on each other? Yeah. The idea is you, it's that you mount someone's face and face. This is not on Facebook. Fuck them bro. They took it off. Did you find it? No, it's a, it's not on the IMD beating. She stole my voice on Netflix. I was talking to

Speaker 5:          02:05:49       don't get in the car on the way here. I watched, uh, Grand Canyon recently. Do you remember Grand Canyon? Yeah, we talked about this. Yeah. It's weird how time has passed since that movie came out. Uh, and how we don't, we don't buy it anymore. We're, we're, we're way more intelligent than 1993 or whenever that movie came out because that movie and the first hour, 15 things happen in one day almost to all these same people. Like what is it fucking

Speaker 4:          02:06:16       well worth the unconnected though. There were a bunch of different things to happen in two people didn't even know

Speaker 5:          02:06:20       kind of, but yet there was also like, all right, the husband, you almost got, you know, mugged in his car, got stolen and then the next morning his wife is walking and found a baby in a Bush and then like, you know, then his secretary or they connected though. Or are they just like, it's all like crazy shit happened in like one day. Like it's so ridiculous now you kind of watching her like this seems pretty extreme, you know, for one day.

Speaker 12:         02:06:45       Yeah. This lesbian and Rafe movie gets terrible reviews. Oh, it's terrible. Horrible documentary. Or should have known there were views of this movie before I purchased it. No, it's really so funny. It's the worst documentary you'll ever see because really all it is is like a porn that somebody wanted to call it documentary cause it's real. It's like reenactments of what girls like, yeah. Yeah. It's like just all these reenactments of lesbian sitting, it's just niches. Reenactments of like some bloods being like sitting on another woman's face. He was like, no, no, I can't get you off exactly that. Lesbians rape each other. Well I guess so man.

Speaker 5:          02:07:24       Brilliant. Yeah, he's dead on. It's weird. It's freaky that you know how to do it so well,

Speaker 4:          02:07:28       wait a minute. Do you know

Speaker 12:         02:07:29       just a real high, he doesn't, Brian knows about that. What do you think happens? What do you think

Speaker 6:          02:07:36       it happens? More ready? Lesbian rape or Chinese Nascar drivers. I shouldn't be in a fucking Chinese dude. He just really loves cars and you get into Nascar and you have to hang out with those assholes. Well can you, hey man, you want to, we'll blows up some Chinese food before the next lab. Oh you know who wants to come on the podcast? I totally forgot about this kid. Dr Ken. Doctor Ken [inaudible]. He's great. Really? Some zookeeper. And he was talking, he hang over. Yeah, he saw Joey d is the other day and he wants to come on and he's hilarious. Norton's in town right now and we should be my call. Yeah. Well I'm, we're all, Duncan and I are only in town for a couple of days cause we gotta get ourselves over the knowledge. We're going to do the house of Blues. It's fucking Friday night and that

Speaker 13:         02:08:28       solve that bitches crazy. Ooh,

Speaker 6:          02:08:32       I can't wait. But we're also right,

Speaker 4:          02:08:34       they're going to be at the UFC Ellenberger versus um, uh, Jake shields this side, this

Speaker 6:          02:08:41       interesting. I know last time portraying Jay,

Speaker 4:          02:08:45       well, you know, people who don't know Jake Shields Dad died and he died just a couple of weeks ago and it's, you know what, I'm in Jake, his dad was his manager. His Dad is like super duper close to him and you know, they grew up whereas dad home schooled him in the mountains. So I mean this is, I mean, I mean everybody's relationship to their father except mine. Cause I don't know that Douche, everybody's relationship is close, you know, and not everybody's for a lot of people's, Jake shields was particularly close to his dad. So, you know, it's for him to, uh, to fight just a couple of weeks after his dad died. It's devastating. And it's down. I was like pretty healthy. His Dad, his dad died in his sleep. His Dad was a vegetarian. I mean he grew up with, Jake is a vegetarian. Jay Jay grew up vegetarian. He only gets his animal protein from eggs, you know, he just believes that, uh, that factory farming is fucked up and he would actually eat food, animal food as long as it was hunted, you know, like,

Speaker 6:          02:09:40       ah, did food is like, like, like, like a Kevin Smith was saying the other day how like just like that everything can fucking change. You know, you could wake up and then I have a stroke. I never walk again.

Speaker 4:          02:09:52       We have to, we have to somehow or another balance, the idea of ambition and, and, and, and, and planning for the future with enjoying the present. And that's the grand dance that everybody has to go through this so difficult to master. And I've, I still don't have it down. No one, no, I don't think anyone ever has it down, but I'm way better at it now than I ever was when I was younger. I'm way better at it and I can offer some insight and here's the number one piece of inside that I can offer that he be reckless. I'm reckless. I'm a little, I'm a little bit reckless, but I'm also really nice. I tried to write as nice as I can, you know, and I'm not, you know, people say, Oh, I'm a Joe Rogan, who's a dick. A guarantee. You're me first

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       for sure. You know, and you might've been a deck because you were nervous or you might've been in debt because you were drunk, but if you're nice to me, I can't be not nice to you. It is impossible. I am. I grew up, I, I've, I've, I've been a nice person as long as I've been capable of being a nice person to know. Don't wear a condom. What are you saying? I'm just saying do everything exactly opposite of what you're told him to do. Well, I don't know if that's the truth. I don't know if that's the case. It's like you have to, because when you start talking about sex, okay. And you say don't work on them, you know, sex to me is just like doing drugs. Natural. It's fine. Yes is natural. It's fun. But you can, you can get caught up in it and you can get fucking crazy. Yeah. And it can, it is, it has just as much of a poll as, as, as any other kind of crazy psychological addiction, whether it's gambling or anything like,

Speaker 12:         02:11:22       but Brian, you don't really mean don't wear a condom. Yeah, I do. It feels good. It feels way better now I'm on them for the first month or two and then you figure out the girl enough. No side. If you want to or need an abortion and your life to appreciate the little things can go wrong. It makes you good together. Closer. A little horror story. I'll tell you a little horror story. I would love to hear it. Um, there's someone that I know, there is someone that I know who got a, who got a waitress pregnant and we just, what did she work? She worked. She just girl, why did you have to make her a waitress? Yeah, because he was a bartender or something. I don't know. Cause they both like they worked at the same place, so it's like, okay, so they worked together at this place.

Speaker 12:         02:12:04       So I'm just going reverse sexism on. Yeah. I don't know why I said I don't mean to leave a people. I'm so sorry. Stop Lesbian rape. They, they uh, so they um, they, they ended up, uh, he ended up putting his pee pee inside of her and the guess what happened? She got pregnant. You should have kept the cell phone in his pocket. Yeah. But yeah, he should have. And guess what? She doesn't want to fucking abortion. No, this is like awesome. This is, this is a one night stand now he's a daddy. Awesome. But it's with someone that he just fucked one night and, and like, yeah, it's like now he's legally bound for the rest of his life to this, to this, to his kid. He didn't wait the two month ago. You got to wear a fucking condom. You're crazy if you don't work on them for two months. Yeah. But you

Speaker 1:          02:12:52       also got to fuck people that you like. Yeah. Don't, yeah. No, it's hard. It's hard to say because you want to fuck anybody want to give up the pussy at a certain point in time, pussy is like water and you're living in a desert. Okay, so you weren't going to get him. You know, it's only until you, you live by a fucking stream. They could drink water every day. Can you see the forest for the trees? Because otherwise your entire waking life is dedicated to getting this resource that is fucking water or pussy. Either one. They're interchangeable and when there are plentiful, then you could see them for what they truly are. You know, and you know, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have to get spoiled does necessarily mean that you have to get that. You know, you, you don't it, you should totally appreciate every single one of the biological pleasures of existence.

Speaker 1:          02:13:37       One of the reasons why I'm a huge fan of Anthony Bourdain is cause he calls himself an enthusiast, but he is a chef and he enjoys, he, he like really shows how much joy you can get in eating great food during the whole fact that the feeling of taste and the feeling of pleasure and the feeling of friendship. I like drinking wine. I like smoking weed. I like going to, I like seeing fun movies. I like listening to great music. You know, I like being, I like being inundated by great feeling shit. You know, I think that's, it's important to wrap our heads around that.

Speaker 12:         02:14:10       Well, I mean, if you can like accept it, it's just like the, there's uh, you know, me and my friend were just talking about this, uh, uh, sorry, the one of the excess, this French existentialist philosopher and like how they have the existential is basically I have this idea where it's like, yeah, you can fucking, you know, enjoy reality and get caught up and being an enthusiast or whatever. But the depths of it, it's just pure absurdity. There's no meaning behind it. There's no meaning to life. It's like just this empty meaning was vortex. So like, you know, for example, like when you see your dog dry hump, another dog, you know, you see the dog dry hump and you're, you kind of watch it. It's kind of funny, but it's like you're, you're watching a, uh, an instinctual trigger, you know, go through the thing and it just acts this thing out. And then when you find yourself humping somebody that you just met and you realize you're going yeah,

Speaker 6:          02:14:59       to the same extent, instinctual trigger and you're like, ah, fuck, same thing. No meaning to this. No meaning, this is just a, I've triggered a series of responses in my primate brain that is wanting to reproduce once, once I come, I'm going to go right back into this state. And that's absurdity. That's a form of absurdity. I got an answer. A question for you Brian, because I, it's so funny you just said that cause I just thought it's something that the other day, like you ever scratch a cats but, and they do that dude, that dude I think where they're just like, yeah, ever fucked a girl and seen her do the exact same thing. It's creepy. It's almost exactly the same. Yeah, it's cause they turned to me and Shane, you know, fucking them hard enough. You've got to fuck them to the point where they're nervous. No body circuiting. I think that's what it is. I need to buy I fuck up dude. I fuck 'em they get nervous for an audition or is, what? Are they nervous for them? And that's a lot of pressure, son. As 185 pounds of Alpha and loads in your body making grunt. No, listen, stop. Like I'll make anybody nervous.

Speaker 1:          02:16:11       Imagine a girl on top of you that's way bigger than you. And while she's talking, you should just start fucking hitting you. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          02:16:16       Fucking bitch. You can fuck me. Could you imagine being a situation where you girl can kick your ass? Have you ever been there like Bourdain's? I don't think so. Well, I don't think board wife can kick his ass. I'm still, he's still a man

Speaker 12:         02:16:30       and she's still anybody on enough adrenaline. Eh, Anthony Bourdain been around the world. I guarantee you he probably has no endurance, but he's, he knows how to throw a straight right dirty boxing match. If you have a hammer, if you have a hammer in your house and you sleep next to somebody, they can kick your ass no matter who they are, what they can slam it. Yeah. They can slam the hammer on your fucking face while you're sleeping. If they catch you off guard. Yeah, they can catch you off guard. Right? So do you want to get gay? It's like, yeah.

Speaker 8:          02:17:00       This videos online of girls sucker punching guys and knocking them unconscious. There's a bunch of them. I mean, it's hilarious. The sucker punch a guy. You know what? A sucker punches. Yeah, I know what a sucker punches a lot of videos of girls, sucker punching guys online. It's a great fetish. Listen man, it's a fucking wide world out there. A lot of fucking things happen. A lot of cross streets, a lot of one thing intersects with this thing when it wasn't prepared. And next thing you know, fucking coked up girl punches a drunk guy in the John knocks him unconscious. It happens all over the

Speaker 12:         02:17:30       [inaudible]. It's like MMA spanking.

Speaker 8:          02:17:32       There was a girl that used to work for a buddy of mine. She was, uh, my friend's assistant and she could punch so fucking hard. She was nice. I mean she wouldn't have ever punched anybody, but she was like, I could punch hard. And I was like, all right, whatever. You know, I'm fucking do commentary for the UFC. You could punch hard. There's some people, man, there's some people that for whatever fucking reason, they got this crazy Tommy Hearns punch. It's a weird thing man. Cause I've, I've experienced this since I was a child since I first started doing martial arts. Every now and then you'll come across some guy who can just, he gets so fucking hard. You're like, where is that coming from? Does he make? He's 160 pounds. Does it make sense? But when he hits the bag, the bag just moves more than anybody else.

Speaker 8:          02:18:17       There was this fucking check and she was a regular girl. She was like 23 years old. She was my friend's assistant and she was like, I can pass. I can punch. Okay. She's like, put your hand up. I put my hand up. She goes, she hit me and I thought about my face. She hit my hand and my hand was stinging. Fuck. And she turned her shoulder into it and through her fucking weight into it and she went to knuckles for, I go, who the fuck taught? You had a punch like that and don't like her dad taught her how to punch people and Shit, but I was like, man, if that check punches you in the face, she will knock you the fuck out. Right? Here's a, if you're not ready for it, it only takes a certain amount of pressure to hit your jaw at a certain way.

Speaker 8:          02:18:55       Your legs just go. I've seen it. I seen him in person. I've seen it in fights. I've seen it in bars, I've seen it all my life. It's a weird phenomenon. If you don't get the job, why the job? What is in that cluster of, it's a design flaw, design flaw, complete design power off button. Well, this is what it is. Your brain is this fucking central core of information, of movement, of everything. All the design, all the direction comes from this spot. Well, what you are your body is is like a fucking a house

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       that has a bunch of ethernet cables in it. You know, and you want to get Internet to your toes. We've got to run wines. You got to run nerves through your whole situation. Well, you also have this thing where you have, you have to chew food, supply the body. So we'll, how do we do this? Well, we're going to have something that moves. We're going to have something that moves and it's going to be hard and boney and it's going to be right in front of all the chords. We have no choice. That's the design and we just got to hope that the human doesn't get hit on the job bone and it doesn't compress all those nerves that send the signals down to all the limbs because if it does, everything shuts off. It's right here, right? That's that. They call that John? No, no, no.

Speaker 1:          02:20:05       It's the actual jaw itself. Is that what they call the button? Yes. What I call the button. It's the movement of the jaw. I got the apple shop presses into the cord. Well, I don't listen. When I say precedent, the court will have, what the fuck do I know is inside my neck? It could be all elves, gummy bears could be all sparkly fairy dust that comes out and you cut my throat. I'm just guessing. But the idea that I have, I've had explained to me is that the nerves, when you punch a person on the jaw that their job on slams into the cluster of nerves behind them and it just causes this big electrical short circuit depending on a bunch of different things to printing on your determination, depending on your anger, your adrenaline level had your focus, whether or not you saw this coming, whether or not you've been punched before, you know how to react to it or how to stay calm under pressure.

Speaker 1:          02:21:01       And depending on the physiological, the physiological design of your actual frame, different body structures have to, can take a different load of impact. You know, like large jaws and big David to luck looking faces. There was a guy named David too. I was still is a very dangerous heavyweight. Boxers is a Samoan dude. Tanga Dude, whatever the fuck he is, he's anyways, whatever he is, I think believe is smaller. The bad ass boxer. And one of the things about him, it says this mother fucker can take a punch man, you can hit David [inaudible] with a bomb. He fought Lennox Lewis and Lennox Lewis connected with straight right hands. It just would have put normal men on the moon and just boom, hits him and he can take it. He just doesn't go out. He's had, he's got an incredible job on top of big, big punching power. So there's that. There's the, the shape of your frame, the shape of your body, the thickness of your tendons and chords.

Speaker 1:          02:21:52       And then, you know, then there's just the fucking design flaw. The jaw goes to the, the cluster of nerves and depending on your sensitivity, some people just shut right off. There's some dudes that they just have a glass jaw man and all you have to do is get to their jaw and it's fun and doesn't have, you know, there's nothing I can do to strengthen. I mean, they get toughen it up a little bit. Who's exercises dude's do, where they fucking lift weights with their jaws. They pull cords with their jaws. They suck a lot of caulk. They, they tried to suck Bryan Cocke. They just hold them down.

Speaker 1:          02:22:25       There's, um, there's things that I've seen guys do. Gerry Cooney who was doing it once in this video I watched the first time I ever saw, we had like, oh, it's almost like a bungee cord and all those tape inside his jaw and he was biting it. It's change a fucking pulling jaw, trying to strengthen this whole set up so he doesn't get knocked unconscious. So embarrassing. Why is that embarrassing? It's fascinating. It's fucking embarrassing his man. Why is it embarrassing? You know? That's embarrassing because you never beat the fuck out of a dude in a cage.

Speaker 12:         02:22:51       No, I don't mean no. Look, no. Look, look, take that shot. Come back with a counter drops. The crowd goes dusk. Hell, it's amazing. I think. I think that's really cool to watch and I fucking love it, right? But I just think that when you get into a situation where you have a bungee cord hanging out of your mouth and you're lifting weights with your jaw, it's embarrassing. It's like that moment in time. If I was doing that, if I'm like, gotta get my fucking dry stronger. Why don't you fucking pick up a history book? It's time to look at a globe job,

Speaker 1:          02:23:26       right? And you're not at the same time. And here's why. You're right. You're right. Because you see where this is all going. You see the falling away of the archaic models and the ridiculous nature of clinging to our monkey genetics. But we aren't. We are trapped in this age and we have about 80 years to have a good fucking time and one of the things that have a good time, you know you got that right, is one of my favorite songs ever. Leonard Karen Song. I like to drink and dance all night. There's nothing wrong with that. It's nothing wrong with liking a drink and dance all night. Now there's nothing wrong with like glad going to fights. These guys agreed to do this. Let them do it. They're going to do what they want to do it. I used to do it, they've got to do it. They're going to do it. Nothing wrong with that. It's go on. Go enjoy it. Yeah. Oh man, I feel really bad about porn and porn exploits women. Well guess what? There's 100 million gigabytes it have on.

Speaker 12:         02:24:20       Yeah, not me. It's you. You're not going to go back in time and keep those girls from being fingered by their uncle. You're not going to do it. What you know, and I've tried and if you can jerk off to that, you will feel better. No, enjoy it. By the way, if like you see like if you see a kid playing with dolls and you go after to the kid and you're like, you know, those dogs aren't real and what you're doing is totally meaningless. You're kind of an asshole. You the kids. Lucky. It's getting to play with dogs. The kids fucking lucky that the kid can get fixated on doors, that he can wear a fucking great towel around his neck and pretend he's a superhero and wander around his backyard with a cardboard sword. Lucky. He's lucky. Lucky. But I, so in the same way, when adults are doing the identical thing and taking on these silly identities is drinking their draws and they're absorbed in their attention is focused on to whatever the fucking thing is, whether it's Leonard Skinner drunk at night of line dancing or somebody punching his fist through a fucking wall or someone climbing a mountain or whatever.

Speaker 12:         02:25:17       If that's grabbing your attention, lucky you, don't stop it, go for it. You're being distracted. The void for a little while, congratulations. Fuck you. But once that shit stops distracting you, if you continue on that path and pretend that it still is like it distracting her from the void, that's like where shit gets weird.

Speaker 1:          02:25:36       Maybe maybe you get to a certain point where you're, where you realize what difference does it make? What difference does it make? What my understanding of the situation is, what differences that make my acceptance of the void if I am but a temporary creature and should I not just enjoy this time. Yeah. And spread as much positive energy as possible and contribute my part in a true and clear understanding that that I cannot fix all the things you ever see those videos, but that is my, my obligation to enjoy this moment and to have as much positive feeling as possible the most spread as much positive feeling as possible. That is my instinct. That is my dry. When I'm in the isolation tank and I'm alone and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, when I'm at my most happiest when I'm thinking about things. You know what I think?

Speaker 1:          02:26:26       I think I have a rare opportunity to spread as much positive energy as possible and I think that is what is most important. That is, that is my instinctual pull. That's what's pulling me. What's pulling me is I feel like I've got this weird, crazy opportunity. We have this weird, crazy opportunity right now. There's at least a half a million people listening to this and will over the course of iTunes and stitcher and Mario Stream. It's more than that. It's going to be easy. It's going to be even more than that over the course of a couple of years because this shit is going to spread and spread and spread. And some of these ideas are going to resonate with people because you are ahead of a lot of other people in this weird game of thinking. There's people out there the right now or listening to this podcast and they are 19 years old and they've never considered any of the ideas that Duncan Trussell is presenting to them. And the idea that you know that that is human civilization and ideas and all these things could be literally alien lifeforms trying to manifest themselves in a conscious way on this plane. And that's how they interact with people. There is a lot of people right now, 17 1615 sitting with their friends, getting their fucking mind blown by you, dude. And you don't think about it because you're just being a new, but that impact is serious and legitimate.

Speaker 12:         02:27:33       Yeah, that's a court. And that impacts, we love it. Well, of course. And also why it's fun to, uh, it's what you're saying is exactly the thing that I'm obsessed with is, is, uh, is, is whatever that is transmitting like as a, anytime you can like help someone be happier, connect with something. It's awesome. Hey, do you think the Dalai Lama on Twitter's real? I don't know if he is. He's fucking positive shit he ever, he writes positive shit every day. He does. He just writes a bunch of fucking passive isn't it? Is Shit. Why is people serve others? Putting the needs of others above their own. The ultimate result would be that you find more happiness. Hmm. He's got sounds like a song written by a dude who's trying to fuck a girl.

Speaker 12:         02:28:21       Amazing. He's got someone's waiting. It's not verified yet. Of course Twitter doesn't verify anymore. I don't know if you guys know that Twitter style verify. Oh well son of a collector, father bitches know you have a collector's edition Twitter that you can sell before it to my spacious cell right now. Yeah, man. But to get back to that idea that we were just talking about. When you find yourself successfully getting fixated on shit, like successfully getting into something, the last thing you should do is stop it. It's really up. It's kind of sad when you see people who really enjoy something and out of some sense of guilt. They're trying to stop themselves from doing it, but like, like addicts, they keep doing stuff even though they're clearly aware of that. It's not satiating them anymore. They're just doing out of heavy. Well, you've been addicted to things. Fuck yeah. Yeah. I've been in, I have, I have an addictive personality, so I know exactly what it's like to have the focus in my mind sucked away by something and for me to consciously think, I don't want to do this anyway.

Speaker 8:          02:29:23       This is a direct, this, this, this conversation. This idea is directly connected to what we were talking about earlier about hijacking the reward system about something that is artificial and artificial in its power and its potency. The idea of what can fucking fucking the Oxycontin pill, that shit is artificial. This is not, suppose somebody, something's not supposed to impact you. That strong a fucking Avatar Avatar in three d if you were a caveman, your, your GNA is basically the same DNA as people that live 10,000 years ago drawing fucking stupid buffaloes and the caves. Well, you know, on the cave walls while we're living by the light of a fire, I mean w w th th th th it's, it's impossible to wrap your fucking head around the kind of impact that's having on the organism.

Speaker 12:         02:30:07       Yeah, well that, that, that it's all a magnification of the four basic drives, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Those are the things that drive all ma or of a prime most organic forms of life. I don't know about Amoebas and shit,

Speaker 8:          02:30:21       but, and love and law and look, look, you know, it sounds gay as fuck, but we could say it because we're drunk. The reason why this podcast works, the reason why, you know, we all can do this over and over and over again is because we love each other.

Speaker 12:         02:30:33       We're all passing notes underneath the table to each other. We're playing footsie about data. Everyone would be if we all are even, how about if we only did this podcast holding hands and with our sweaty feet touching each other [inaudible] with each other afterwards. Like we all like that.

Speaker 8:          02:30:56       But you know the reason why we can have this conversation and be so fucking crazy with our ideas that is, you know, I'm not going to judge you. You know the judgment between you and me is already done. It's over. We met each other, we know each other literally inside and out. I know that your weirdest fucking thing. You lived with me. We lived together. Yeah. You know, you know and Brian and I have known each other for almost a decade. What are, we've known each, we know each other inside and out. Brian and I have cried together. Its gaze

Speaker 4:          02:31:20       that sounds, yeah, we, we've cried together. You know, he's, he's my friend. We've known each other forever. So because that, because we know each other so well and we know we're both looking out. We're all three looking out for each other. Rather we can say anything and then we can say anything. But what we're doing is we're saying anything and somehow or another way more people than we're ever going to meet ever in our fucking life are listening all at once. Yeah, it's crazy. That's where things get squirrely and that's where things get, you know when we sit and be calm to play, like you know, what is consciousness? What is reality? What are ideas? What does imagination, where does it go? Why is it going? Why is it going through you? Why is it going through me? Why do you, why are we so looking forward to going to New Orleans where this weekend you and I are going to go to the house of Blues, a sold out show and we're going to perform for that. We don't know those people. I'll probably know 10 people in the audience will be a bunch of people from the UFC that we'll ask for tickets, I'll hook them up, you know, they'd be 2030 people and it's you and me and we can have the greatest fucking time and right. It's going to be incredible big. Why? Because you've been putting that thing out your whole life. And I've been putting that thing out of my whole life.

Speaker 12:         02:32:20       You would cry if you, if he found out it was a guy also, what guy? The, when we create it again,

Speaker 2:          02:32:29       fucking podcasts over Brian. Brian gets the line of the night.

Speaker 4:          02:32:34       If you want to get in touch with Dunkin and you can follow him on Twitter and now he's obligated to respond to all of your messages because he told you that all you had to do was call him about the flux.

Speaker 2:          02:32:43       I didn't say podcasts,

Speaker 12:         02:32:45       searches video with Tim and Eric. I don't think we've ever talked about it on this podcast that we talked about it and he has the surfing video, the body surf, Adi Boys, legend, Legend or the pipe. One of the best videos. I laughed my ass off. Yeah, it's pretty great. So it's something I did with Tim and Eric for a HBO is funny or die. Is that it? It's, you know, it's something I did for Tim and Eric for Hbs, funny or die and it's like, basically I take off on the skateboarding videos, but it's about, we play these 80, it's like idiots who learned to body surf. But mainly it's just about us all. Fucking this one dude on the team. It's really, it's one of the best things. You fucked a dude on a beach. Each horse, each horse thought of it. You kissed another guy. What was it like to kiss another guy? It was amazing.

Speaker 2:          02:33:37       You kissed.

Speaker 12:         02:33:38       You guys are real. Well, I mean, I, I believe it was on the cheek. No, I don't remember it though. It was on the Dick. You know. I love you bro. I'm just kidding. All right. It's a very funny video.

Speaker 4:          02:33:48       What are the dates, man? Uh, what's still available this weekend is totally sold out tomorrow, by the way. Nowhere out of nowhere show we're doing it. The Ice House. Oh, here's, here's what you should talk about this real quick. We are all of us. Uh, last weekend we did the comedy. Um, there's, there's two rooms at the Ice House in Pasadena, which is one of my favorite clubs in the country. It's been around for about 30 plus years, I think. 35 years. It's not just a comedy club, it's Goddamn museum you bought. It's like the comedy and Magic Club and her Masa. It's one of those clubs. It's been forever and

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       it's got all this like a really amazing history and the walls and it's a really cool fucking club. And there's a, there's two rooms. There's the big showroom. I say big, you know, in quotes, it's 185 seats. It's very small. It's very intimate. But then this other room it's like 85 seats. And uh, you know, Brian and I w you know, an all company. You've, uh, you've talked about it, we've talked about it before about like, what's the perfect size of the comedy club? I don't know. I mean, we're, this weekend we're going to do somewhere around 700 people at the House of Blues, which is, you know, like a medium. And then there's like the really small places where it's like the ice house, which is like 85 people. And then this October 7th at in Houston with uh, uh, Brendan Walsh and me and Joey Diaz, we're going to do that horizon wireless theater, just like thousands of fucking people. So it's all different sizes, but there's something magical about those little fucking rooms, man. And we did that little, we did that little 85 seat room at the ice house this, this past weekend. And Brian and I and, and Ari and manager Madrigal and Brendan Walsh, all of us, we got together and we talked about, I was like, this place is fucking great. And then someone came up the idea, I don't know,

Speaker 6:          02:35:28       it was, I was like, imagine just renting out that room right there and doing a podcast. And I showed, okay, that's fine. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:35:33       Well it also, Brendan said, I know it was Brendan Walsh said, why don't I just do it right here, right in front of the door, which I don't know if that

Speaker 6:          02:35:39       word, but it might work sometimes. Can you imagine fans trying to do a podcast? Well, this is what I was thinking. If we hired some Tait Fletcher looking dudes to fucking keep people away from you and fucking keep the peace and then just the energy of all those people. As long as they didn't interfere the energy of all those people hanging out sec. When we did the live show with Jim Norton, there was definitely a different feeling. When you are trying to feel like you're entertaining people watching you, it's cool to hear. We're hanging out. Podcast has great. I did a live podcast at the laughing skull on stage. It was fucking awesome. That's a small club.

Speaker 1:          02:36:15       Norton is small too. We did it at Kevin Smith's placement only like 60 people I think, but my point is that you can, you can. We're going to do our idea for a podcast with, we kind of assimilate it all our ideas together and the best idea seems to be wherever we put it, it's the comics that are right about to go on stage or just got off stage and we're fucking smoking when we're talking shit. Just like this, just like the show and we do it. You Know Brendan Walsh, Jon Heffron, John Reese, who the fuck? Who the fuck is in town? You know anybody who, Joe Judah Friedlander texted me and said he wants to come on the show. How would you to frailer Freelander you know, calls us on a Wednesday night and says, Hey, I want to come to your fucking crazy podcast thing at the ice house. Boom. It comes down to the ice house and we have this wild ass show with 85 people in that little room. We do a free

Speaker 6:          02:37:02       podcasts. We all have a good time. The idea with Hollywood bullshit. Exactly. Not deal with traffic and black wizards, black wizards and parking and nonsense. Listen, you fucking Goddamn fucking

Speaker 8:          02:37:16       show is over. Wait, can I tell people this show I'm doing

Speaker 2:          02:37:26       testing

Speaker 8:          02:37:30       September 23rd uh, Joe Diaz Brennan. Oh No. Joe Diaz, Ari Shaffir and I are at the paramount theater in Denver. Colorado tickets are still available. They're going quick. There's not much left. If you're interested in brain pills, go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t.com if you want to see one of the best, most interesting and fascinating standup comics in the country. And one of my best friends, go see Duncan Trussell at the laughing skull in Georgia and Atlanta, Georgia. And when is that? That's at the end of this month, and I'll be in Seattle. What was it?

Maybe so we can upload the video on Vimeo. We can't do it. What's, what do you mean we can't do it live? But no, I mean like if we're at a hotel that the internet sucks. The new Ustream lets you record to your computer and then go back and upload it later. What's, yeah. For Real. Yeah. For Real. So we can do private shows whenever we went to, you know, is this some new shit? Yeah. And you should, when did this happen? Uh, about a month ago. And what does this Vimeo thing, you've got some shit up on vein. It's like youtube.
