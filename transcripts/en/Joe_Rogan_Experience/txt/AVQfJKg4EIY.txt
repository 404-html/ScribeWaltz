Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Good. Goodly Moodley Jamie. We're all hopped up on adderall here at the, at the Rogan studio with Tj supplied some adderall. He came here from Columbus and they just give it to you at the airport. It's like, you know, they're handing out little samples. Yeah, I just got this little guy here, Anna, wrong. Imagine if we did come up with a drug that had adderall like effects but no negative consequences. In fact health benefits. Well I don't know. Some people are prescribed adderall so for some people you know, apparently they just think all right for you this is good. Yeah. Oh No, no, no. Does she just let people decide that for themselves and they just, you know, let everyone try adderall and they keep taking it. If they don't, they stopped taking. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I mean some people obviously benefits them. They should be able to get it whenever they want.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       They shouldn't. I don't have the, they should have to go to a doctor about that. How about that? You want to try it? Two Thousand Fifteen, 16. We know what adderall is. Yeah, they at least have a place where you can go get a free sample, you know? Well, how come you can try whiskey? All you have to do is be of age. You don't have to have any knowledge whatsoever about whiskey and you can be on the 21st day or the 21st year of your life. The first day you could walk right into a cvs, buy a jug of whiskey. Would no instruction manual? No guidelines? No. No one to walk you through it going. Have you ever done this before? Do you have any idea what a shot is like? You just have to get to try to drink a glass. You might die, you know, thinking back to my first time drinking, maybe it is a good thing that there's like some barriers, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       Yeah. Because I don't know. The first time I got drunk really drunk. They just handed me like a Coffee Cup full of vodka at a party and I never even been to a party before because I was so socially awkward and Shit. I'm like 17 and my first party and I'm like, okay, I don't know how strong this is, but I'm just going to assume that one cup is good. Oh God. So I just, hey, you know, it was the, the rest of the night did not play out in my favor. After that, I had a very similar story. My first time I was in high school, First Party, new high school, just move. There was all Dorky, didn't hardly know anybody and I made friends with this kid. Jimmy Law is who's still my friend to this day, great guy and his fucking party and I remember I couldn't even smell Jack Daniels for like years later or I would get sick to my stomach.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       I had that problem for awhile. I grew up in a cab that's always rough. Throw up in a cab, like halfway opening the door to wherever. Lucky enough to puke. I always just piss myself. Is that better? I think that's better. It's my pis that's not freaking me out. Like, I don't know. I'd rather know if you puke and then it's like, oh God. And then afterwards you're like, oh, okay, I feel I feel kind of better now. You don't feel good about waking up with your pants covered in Piss, especially because by that time you're almost sober again. You do have a point, you know? Then you've got to look down and like, oh my God, I'm a grown man. That just piss my pants because I drank too much. Depends on how you look at it, man. I feel like a grown man. It throws up. Its more of a pitch to the guy who piss themselves. All right, well then I guess I'm less of a bitch. I think you're right dude.

Speaker 1:          00:03:21       Joe Rogan podcast. All right dude. Throw up is a contagious pisses and I think that's part of the problem with throw up. Like if you smelled throw up, you're like immediately you smell it and you want to start throwing. You never smell someone else's pissed and be like, I gotta take a piss now you imagine if that's what it was like if somebody farted and like Ah, Kinda Shit. How and when it was contagious. Yeah. Like oh my God. I mean burst. I heard him fart. Now I got to shit. What been, why isn't? And if you smell diarrhea, shit, all my friends had to. Shit. Yeah, I guess. I guess diarrhea is evolutionarily, like if you, if you throw up the rest of the people around like, Oh, you know, we're all eating the same shit. He Sat, we better fucking expelled this stuff to 100 percent.

Speaker 1:          00:04:10       That's exactly what it is. It's really interesting because uh, I, I became immune to it for a long time because I was around Puke so much on fear factor. It's, it's back now. A little freak out over puke now. Like if I'm passing through a restaurant and someone through. I saw someone throw up recently in Vegas. I was, I was close to him when I was like, oh boy. I felt it a little. But all the years of fear factor man, I saw people throw up like almost every week. Pretty much everybody threw up one time. My fucking brother who's also my business partner, we've lived together our entire lives. He got sick and he went to the bathroom and be in the fucking idiot that he is. He doesn't puke in the toilet. He pukes in the sink and it fills the sink to the brim, to the brim with fucking puke.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       Oh No. Can you guess what? He's so fucking sick. He can't clean it, so he has to clean face in the fucking pool is the most horrible experience in my life. Oh, how about those fucking crazy people that administer colonics and they start telling you what you're reading by looking at your shit as it goes through a tube in front of them. What about those wacky folk? I have no experience with that, so I've never done it either, but everyone that I know that's done it. Like first of all, I don't. I don't think you're necessarily supposed to do it that way. I feel like if you eat fiber, it cleans everything out from the inside. That's probably better than blowing water up there. I'll probably gonna get a bunch of tweets from people that love Kalanick. Oh yeah. Well, everyone's got their little health.

Speaker 1:          00:05:39       Craziest shit. Some people think that they can poke needles in themselves and hit certain parts of their foot. And you. Have you ever seen that reflexology? Like psychology. That's bizarre stuff, right? Like pulling your toes to fix my shoulder hurts. Let me work on your foot. Okay. You, I'm sure people believe it, but I don't. It seems unlikely. Yeah. It doesn't mean maybe, I don't know anything more research needed, but I've talked shit about acupuncture, but apparently people use it works. Some people use all kinds of things and say they work. I mean, you know, right. There's no, but I think there's actual evidence about acupuncture and made some sort of a peer reviewed journal about hey, if there is, I'm open to it, but I'm pretty sure it was pointed out to me, the mind a little hazy right now. There's definitely been times when I've said Shit on a show or in a video and then I'll be like, I am fucking certain about this, and then I get a bunch of messages.

Speaker 1:          00:06:37       I'm like, these fucking idiots trying to prove me wrong and I look at their perspective. I'm like, Oh shit. I guess I was wrong. Well, in six months I'll just act like I never believed that. Well, do you change your mind though because of people correcting me? I'd definitely do. You got to have to. I don't want to be some close minded idiot that just believes the same thing no matter what. Yeah, and people love you to be beholden to your earliest beliefs, like if you had an idea a long time ago and it was wrong. Like if he said something I one of your youtube videos and it turned and you were like, this is a fucking fact, and then it turns out to not be a fact and yeah, you're not allowed to make a mistake. It's just immortalized forever in history like this time.

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       What about the time you said that it's like maybe I think differently now because years and years of time and experience of pass. Well you know what happened with dumb people. Unfortunately the term flip flopper got out and what a flip flopper is, is someone who changes their fucking mind, which means you're a normal person. The idea that you're going to be a president or a congressman or senator and never changed your mind once you establish this esteemed position, once you're in there, you get elected, you got rock solid ideas about how the world works and you're so enlightened. You no longer need to learn or correct your ideas. That's ridiculous. But to dummies, now they have that term. Oh, he's a flip flopper fucking tj. The flip video from seven years ago, all those life experiences before that, that fucking dude was saying this, you're a flip flopper.

Speaker 1:          00:08:10       I wonder if they're just that consistent in their lives. You know, they just want to find something to fuck with you on. They're just trying to poke, poke out horse, you know, that's like the, the nature of life, uh, you know, on the internet or in any sort of public lens, even in the wild, I mean, it's natural you, you find a guy like you, you puts out, you put up these very interesting thought provoking videos. You have strong opinions and you broadcast them out there. And then there's gonna be a bunch of people that respond to them. Some people really enjoy them, some people get really mad at you, but because your stuff is good and that you have really interesting points, you get a lot of attention. And when you get a lot of attention, people go, fuck that guy, man. That shit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       I'll fucking kick his ass if I see him. I heard that shit. He said about all you have to do is put it in context of lake. You know, even if you find like, you know Christopher hitchens or something like the most eloquent fucking guy you can, there's still gonna be people that fat. Fuck. What? Did you see? What happened when he doctored? Yeah, of course. You know, he's in hell now he's burning. Yeah. Because he's a misogynist. Oh yeah. Now that's the truth. Yeah, that's that, that little bit of revisionism too. I forgot about that. The data was, uh, an interesting one that people chose to attack because it was like, it was so white nighty that it was, it was like blinding. Like you had to put sunglasses on to read the tweets, like, oh, Christopher hitchens was a massage. I know what he was a debater.

Speaker 1:          00:09:35       He loved to debate people on anything and he knew that a very thought provoking subject was the idea that the only way women are funny is if they act like men. And so he wrote that Vanity Fair article and he's a fucking genius. Trolls. What he is, he's, he's batting around a mouse and so we have to remember too, is this, the bar for massaging is so low. I mean like better that I've made videos like, all right, let's just, I believe in equality between men and women legally and all. Always, you know, every opportunity man has a woman should have. Let's just get that out of the way right off the bat. But I think this wage gap thing is a little wonky massage. I just like, yeah, instantly. I mean, you know, I sat there and I explained to you that I'm just, we have a fucking point of contention on an, on an issue of economics that doesn't make me a fucking misogynist.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       The wage gap thing is a really weird one because people just don't want to talk about it. They, when you say, well, this wage gap thing, the way it's been explained to me is a bunch of different jobs that people pursue and the jobs that men pursue tend to be higher paying jobs. Also higher risk jobs. More men die while they're employed. They die on the seven percent. Some crazy number is really high, but when you taught, when you, if you, if you even go into that, you can't. Those, those are problematic pieces of information because just the fact that they exist at all, you're attacking them like it becomes this really weird thing where you're not. You're not supposed to talk about the actual facts of what is happening in the workplace. So the actual numbers. Forget about the fact that we know there's white bosses who were racist.

Speaker 1:          00:11:15       We know there's men who are bosses who were sexist. We know there are women who are bosses who hate the other women in the office and you fucked them over. We know people are getting fucked over left and right. We know and I think you could put it into a good people, bad people thing. I mean that's really what you're dealing with. You can call it man or women, you can call it whatever the fuck you want to call it, but it's good people and bad people and that's you. As soon as you pick a side, it's only gender based and any information whatsoever is unacceptable and that's why. That's why I don't like the, the Mras and the snake towels and shit. It's like all you're doing is inverting the whole victim complex thing. You're just saying, you know, you get after them for saying we're the give us special

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       privileges, but you're just trying to flip the script and do the same thing from the other end is the only place they have a point is financially I may have some. I think they have some points in a child custody and stuff like that too. But I mean as far as like saying that they're victims. Sure. As far as like really establishing this idea that for whatever reason it's okay for a guy to get fucked over in a relationship. To the point where he loses everything just because these two people don't want to be together anymore. That that's been firmly established. That's not part of like a systematic society wide impression of man, not just an issue. It's a legal issue. It's it. Yeah. And it, it can be taken seriously on its own. You don't need an ideology to address it. Just like you don't need feminism to address, you know, problems that women have, which I'm sure there are plenty of feminist grievances that are well founded, well thought out and shit, but I mean they're drown out by, you know, the tits and video games are too big or they're too small.

Speaker 2:          00:12:50       Like there's a famous example of this, this, uh, Anita Sarkeesian, you know, she was complaining about the old Tomb Raider Games because Lara Croft tits were too big. And then they made them smaller. And then she said, oh, well look how they're defeminized Lara Croft to make her look more like a man. Just, you know, it just proves that she's an unpleasable can. No matter what you do, I'm just going to find fault. She's gonna find a fucking problem. There's going to be people that whatever hot button issue, you know, especially when it comes to gender, gender is a real hot button issue. It'd be crates like almost instant argument. I don't know why. I don't know why. Why is it? I don't know. There's gotta be a reason there. Yeah, sure. There has to be a reason, but I don't. I don't really get. I mean I guess it's maybe just the history of that inequalities have existed, but I mean, I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:13:39       I don't know why people still have such a hair trigger reaction on the gender thing or why it's so important because like what's weighted? It's weighted by the actions of the past. You can't look at it as a thing that exists in the present. I mean even the current, if you're a person who is being victimized, like if you're a girl is being sexually harassed by a boss or something like that. It exists in the present or whatever. Fill in the blank with sexual harassment, but it's not you and it's not me and we're not doing what I have in these conversations about the wage gap when I was working, when I was a teenager, I was working in my dad's office and there was a woman there and she was perfectly attractive, but she would make very strong like, come on, it's to me, you know, she'd be like grabbing my ass and shit and you know, I just, I wasn't interested, but you know, it's like when I wasn't interested, it's like, oh, you know, we think Tj is gay or something because he didn't want that. So I mean it's one thing, at least for women, there's that mechanism there of like society kind of has something built in to believe you if you're a victim of sexual harassment. But for me it was like there was nowhere to turn. Did you feel like a victim? I mean, I didn't feel like a victim because I don't like to foster the victim mentality, but I certainly felt like there was an issue going on in my life that I had no ability to address.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       Was she above you in the office? Yeah. Oh, okay. So that makes it weird too. Yeah, she was like, uh, the manager of all the people in the call center because we'll call sand. She was just a crazy lady you want and how much fun in the office and she was. She was pulling, you know, she was grabbing my ass. I mean, Hey, if you want, if, if I was into it, cool, you know, if I reciprocated. And I was like, yeah, we've got a fun office now. Right? Because you imagine what would have happened when it became obvious that I didn't like it. It's just like, you know, Oh, why? Why are you going to keep doing this? Oh. So she kept doing it like it was, it was a persistent pattern, just like, you know, day after day, I don't know, probably three or four months.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       Holy Shit Dude. So every day you would go to work and you'd be thinking, fuck, this crazy lady's going to grab my ass, and I just didn't like her. Wow, man. That's not cool. That's not cool for us. I was so. I was so passive than to. I mean I really didn't know how to say anything. I got to assert yourself because you know, I wasn't very assertive at the time. That's a hard spot. That's a hard spot for a human being. You know, I, I think there's a real problem when people don't want to look at you as a guy who's in a hard spot because you are a male, right? Whereas if you were a woman and you were in that same position at the same age and the same awkwardness at the time, I would feel really bad for you. I'd be like, fuck man, what an asshole that guy is, or what an asshole that woman is.

Speaker 1:          00:16:14       If the woman was grabbing her ass and she was freaking out, it'd be the same kind of reaction have if you had a young girl who worked in the office and was a little awkward and there was this like super aggressive woman who kept grabbing her ass all the time and freaking out and it was a woman who was above or in the office. That would be a really creepy scene, but you don't get much sympathy for your store. Why would I? Yeah. Because there's no. There's no social mechanism that says that's a problem. Yeah. It just looks like, Oh, you know, that's just some funny, isolated thing. But you know, when I've told that story, I've had other people come forward and say like, yeah, I had that problem too, and I just didn't know what to do about it because you know, if you're a man, you can't say I was sexually harassed, but you know it just because you're not interested in a particular woman who seems to have way too much interest in you.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       That's not reciprocated on your part. Yeah. What the fuck, man, that's a weird. A blind spot, we have what I mean, if you're a man, you're supposed to deal with it, but that's across the board. I mean that's like. It's not just men that say that women say that to across the board, but if you're a man you're just supposed to, but that's one of my larger point is that when it comes to these like feminist and gender issues, it's like we're supposed to always believe that there's a gender root cause to what's happening. It can't just be that one person is horny for another person that doesn't want that person back, which can happen to anybody. Yeah. There's too many variables with people to take a side based entirely on gender. There's just too many variables. Variables are a form of mysogeny there. There are trigger warnings, variables or trigger warnings and unto themselves I think. I think

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       you, you know, we kind of addressed human beings as individuals, as human beings being male, female, gay, straight. Who gives a shit. Let's get on a team. I try to do it too. I think we all try to do it. It's difficult when it's not being done like universally all around us. When I was a kid, this is a true story. When I moved from San Francisco to Florida, I was 11 years old. Yes, I was 11 years old. We moved to Florida and I didn't know what the word nigger meant. I didn't know. I had no idea what it meant because I lived in San Francisco. San Francisco is super diverse in the seventies. This was like the Vietnam War ended when I was in San Francisco, so this was like hippies and fucking people with bell bottoms and like my stepdad would get whistled at her when he was with me.

Speaker 3:          00:18:40       It was like crazy how weird people were. It was like a real freaky place to be like a young kid, but no racism. I mean, none of that fucking never heard those words at school. So then I go to Florida and I heard it like first day someone's calling somebody a nigger. I'm like, what the fuck is that? So I didn't want to say I didn't know because then I would look like a loser. So I had to go home and I asked my mom, she got pissed and maybe she thought I was playing a game. She's like, you're trying to get me to say it. I'm like, I'm not trying to get you to say. I like, what does it mean? She was, you don't know what it means. I'm like, you gotTa fucking tell me. I'm like 11 years old. What the fuck does it mean?

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       And so she had explained to me that it was a derogatory term for black people. I was like, what? Like at 11, I was like, what the fuck? What, what real. Those are real. Like I couldn't, I couldn't imagine it at that time. So it is possible to grow up in a place like maybe it was just the area that I was when I was young, if we could somehow or another promote that sort of universal look, it doesn't make you immune to doing something stupid because you're gay. It doesn't make you immune to being an asshole because you're a chick. It doesn't make you immune to whatever. I mean fill in the blank gender wise. Just people as individuals. That's why I like star Trek. Am I running for office? That's why you like star Trek Star Trek because you're not enough diversity. A lot of men run a white men running, you know, there's a lot of diversity, especially compared to, uh, the shows on at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:20:05       And you know, first interracial kiss on star Trek, one of the first lesbian kisses on star Trek. Really? Well, not the original series, but on deep space nine. I don't count those as well. I did. Those aren't star track. They just stole the name, you know, I don't even like the original series. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I just don't. It's too cheesy. It's too corny. Goodness. It's a time capsule though, right? Well, yeah. It's definitely cheesy. A cheesy time. Best forgotten. Well, it's become a comedy. It's a comedy. It wasn't intended it as the time. No, it was not. But if you watch it today, it truly is a comedy, especially if there's any aliens involved. Like when Kirk Kirk had to duke it out with that one dude with the lizard head. Oh my God, it's so slow.

Speaker 1:          00:20:50       It was a fake, it was so fake looking like sped up the film or something. At least they should have made it in the dark. First of all, the plan should have been total darkness. So the monster was like very hard to see because see, when you look at all of it, you're like, what is this piece of shit you're trying to tell me as an alien? But my point about star trek was though they never really talk about that kind of stuff. It's not like, you know, if there's a black character, there's no issue dealing with their blackness, you know, it's all been moved past. Look at this. Look, is this real? Oh my God. Come on, come on. This is real. Oh my God, this is so hilarious. Oh, Kirk, with a Shitty Moy Thai terrible technique doesn't turn his hip over. No weight to that.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       So this is, um, is it playing with sound too? Okay. So what we're looking at for people listening to this. So I'm so sorry I haven't been describing this. Is Captain Kirk Duking it out with the shittiest fucking fake looking green man. Alien on this planet, it was like one of the cheesiest scenes in all of Star Trek. It's just so bad. Kirk boxes is yours to get free. It's just, it's everything's bad about it. The acting is bad. The movement is bad. Like they're moving in slow motion. Like when he's trying to throw punches at the guy. Now Kirk is coming out with a rock. Oh Shit. He's got a rock and he's. There's a closeup as he lifts it over his head and throws it and he hits him right in the chest and guess what? It does nothing. It just bounces off of a curse.

Speaker 1:          00:22:28       Like what? Like do, just start walking. That fucking thing is never going to catch you. It is the slowest piece of shit of all time. Yeah. Just stroll away leisurely and it walks up to a big rock and that was going to pick up the big rock look like that fucking piece of shit. Fake rock is good Lord. So this lizard thing that literally it's expression does not move. It's a child's toy. It throws this rock at Kirk and he barely gets out of the way. A little too casual. They are correct. If that was a real fucking rock, you'd be shitting your pants, man. That rock was within six inches of hitting him and tearing his arm off his body. Fucking goofy. You're right. It's too cheesy. I hate when people are right, you know, at least. I mean, there's some cheesy moments. I'm like the next generation or something, but there's nothing like that.

Speaker 1:          00:23:17       I never got into it. I never got into it because there was this guy named Kevin Knox who is a hilarious comedian in Boston and he had this ruthless bit about, uh, what the fuck did they do to the Old Star Trek? Wow. Who's this fucking new captain? Go, who's this new bald guy is new captain. He was, he would do this long rant about like how great captain Kirk was and how much this guy sucks. And out of respect, I never watched the uh, all right, now at least I can. At least I can understand the reasoning. There was a little logic to it. Very little, but it's amazing how bad special effects were just a few decades ago. Yeah. But you know, that was a, that could have been done better even in the time, like you said. I mean like shooting in the dark, speed it up a little, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       Well that was done in what the sixties, seventies and it was probably either 66 or 67 were like late sixties. Right. I mean you think about the great move, I mean the hustler with Paul Newman and Jackie gleason. That was just a few years before that. That is a great move. So they were doing great. We saw that last year, you know? Oh really? Wow. That's great movie man. Jackie gleason was a fucking hell of an actor. It's really interesting to see his, his career got so weird. Like he did so many different things going from like the honeymooners to like doing a serious role, like the hustler where he wasn't funny at all to doing smokey and the bandit, which is like so slapsticky and hilarious. Smokey and the bandit holds up. It does. It holds up. Yeah. My first girlfriend showed me that movie. I found it weird because, you know, I've never really thought of sally fields is very sexual, but in that movie, you know, I didn't like her ass.

Speaker 1:          00:24:54       It was very big. I remember that good. She's a sweetheart. She was like America sweetheart. Like a sweet woman. Like you couldn't. You could never see an engineer from my generation. The only role I really remember him prominently if like from being a kid was like the mom and forrest gump and I was like, fuck that. Yeah. Sally field when she was young, definitely had something go on. She had a little bit of that ginger know Maryanne, the little bit of that. Maryanne from Gilligan's island thing. Yeah, but Maryanne was considerably hotter. I agree. She was like pretty like pretty much had a girlfriend that was, I don't know, building is falling apart too. We're being attacked. I think there's people fixing something or something. Sorry about that. Now UFO attack sally fields. I'm ginger and Maryanne. Maryanne had that thing too, like if you think ginger is a little too high maintenance, if you've known someone like her, look what we got.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       We got this girl that probably knows how to plant things. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing. It's probably a bad thing, but I used to date a girl who wrote Gilligan's island. Erotic fan fiction does. Definitely not a bad thing. Yeah, because that's fun. That would be a bad thing. You know, I, I don't know. I like it because I'm like, you know, she can be turned on by Gilligan, you know? It seems like I'll, I'll have an easy task of it. Yeah. Have you seen, um, there's a whole genre of bigfoot porn? No, I've not seen that. Yeah. There's, there's a woman who's writing these big foot sexual novels would like, and they're there. There they're like real books, like, I don't know if it's in like going out to a book, you know, going out to bookstores kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:26:35       That's a good question. I know they're definitely ebooks, but I'm pretty sure they're real books too, but it's bigfoot. I'm, I might be wrong about that. It's big foot porn like this is. Here it is. Come for bigfoot volume one. We'll look at that bitch. Three and a half fucking stars. Volume one. Customers books one through five. How many of these fucking books are out? All my God. Scroll up so I could read this on a week long outing in Mount Hood National Forest. What begins as a flirty fun field trip soon turns into a nightmare when an ape like creature kidnaps a group of teen girls with the purpose of procreating with them, thus began the erotic adventure of a lifetime and inconceivable love story between a young woman in her horny, sasquatch. Wow, right mix of horror and erotica says scarlet Jones, who is scarlet Jones?

Speaker 1:          00:27:26       I don't know. She said scarlet's on the ball. She said it's the right mix, and so there's a bunch of these titles come for bigfoot volume to a. They should have had. They could have some of this. Another thing they didn't have to. Oh, this is. It gets even better. Hold on. Go back to school. Make that a little larger. Oh my God. Look at this kid, horny, ape like creature said, Mount Hood, national forest, but her name is portia for shifts. Shelly and Leslie find themselves it'll lusty situation as a tribe of bigfoot's use. They're willing, willing new bio bodies to satisfy their monster Cox. How can porsche leave all this behind and return to civilization when she's in the arms of her sasquatch, warm and snugly and is mad at for the only thoughts going through her mind are of utter bliss, but challenges around what the fuck, but challenges abound for this star crossed lovers including Leonard's head injury. The guy got a head injury, there's a male, so they kicked up a male to male human and it devastating wildfire and as sexy forest ranger named Mike. Oh my God, this is hilarious. Do you think, you know, they say it's hard to go black and then go back. Could you go big foot and go back? Probably not. Definitely not. You'd be all stretched out. Fucked up.

Speaker 4:          00:28:51       It'd be like a like a

Speaker 1:          00:28:55       golf pencil after that. Yeah. What a strange genre of Erotica. I mean, I don't know if it's just this one woman who's writing this or if there's others, find out if there's a big foot. Porn is an actual genre. Young Jamie, when you find out how legit this actually is, I mean, why not, right? Why not? I mean, if there's bronies oh yeah, that's true. People jacking off to like weird animated ponies and Shit, you know, I'll do hangouts and stuff for my podcast and some of the people that come into the private hangouts or bronies, so I kind of get to like try to probe their mindset and uh, I, you know, I asked these guys like, so do you jerk off to the all the porn that they got out there?

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       They know, you know, for me it's more just about fascination to go show with a good story. Like show with a good story. There's plenty of shows with good stories that are made for adults that don't have, you know, a little cute animated ponies in them. Right. Why would we care though? Really? Right. I don't give a shit. They can do what they want. Yeah. I don't give a shit either, but I'm not going to trust your judgment. Right? You, you're going to like, if someone tells you about something that's awesome and you know he's also a brony. You're going to go, oh, okay. Thanks dude. Yeah, you got to kind of weigh that out. Yeah. This guy says this place is cool, but he is a brony. So. And

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       if you were a brony but you hadn't discovered brony ism and you were missing something in your life, you just felt like there was just a whole. Would you recognize it instantly? Maybe you would. Maybe the moment you saw my little pony, it was just your heart would just fill with like, like, like sparkles. Everything just feels alive and wonderful and warm for the first time and it's the perfect entertainment and you watch my little pony and you just, you get chills. You just feel great about everything and you go, this is what I've always needed. I needed this. And so you start secretly wearing my little pony tee shirts under your dress shirts at work, and you go home and you put on my little pony way, cooking yourself a lonely dinner. But you're happy now because you discovered what was always missing my little pony. You found the missing piece for somebody that's got to be possible mad if people want to be furries, right? If somebody wants to run around with a chip monck mascot outfit on and like furries. You heard of the other kin? Yes. There are even crazier. Yeah. Once you describe those, for the people that don't know what the fuck we're talking about, right?

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       Other 10, prepared, preparing mind blown folk. If a Brownie is like someone who is like, I like to pretend to be a fox, I wear this, you know Fox mass. Yeah. Yeah. I know I'm, I'm, I'm just starting with furries because it's Kinda like you were saying brony. Oh sorry. The furry, you know. And I like to wear a Fox mask and I like to gift with other furries. That's their term for fucking. I don't know why they can't just use the word fucking. Yeah, they call it riffing. Why iff? Yep. Don't know. Anyway, so that's, that's a furry right. And uh, and other kin is different but similar, but way worse because they actually think like, I am a Fox and I have the soul of a Fox within me. And they also claim to have astral limbs. Like they can feel the Fox tail. It's not just Fox as it could be. Dragons, you know, they say I'm a dragon, I have the soul of a dragon. I'm a reincarnated dragon. Um, you know, all kinds of stuff. Spirit, animal, they, they even have like a fiction. Can they go a step further? They, they, they think they somehow are characters from TV shows. I even saw this post on tumbler where someone's

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       like, you know, I was Joffrey from game of thrones and I don't regret shit that I did. You're allowed to be whatever you want. Now. You've got a lot of questions you anymore. No criticism is hate. It is. And, and, uh, you know, there's people that go around saying they're like a laptop, Ken and computer can we, things that don't even have souls to begin with. Like I share a kinship with computers. These people listed like, Oh, you know, it sucks that I have this fleshy body now because my true body is made of metal because I'm an android kin. Oh my God. And they're serious. I'm serious. That's scary. I mean it's like identity politics gone fucking bat shit. What are their preferred gender pronouns? Um, I don't know if they have specific pronouns for the each other kin, but most of them do tend to like, you know, the CSI kind of shit.

Speaker 1:          00:33:36       I was on some websites that I was just scrolling around looking for information, looking for new stories. And I saw a story, I think it was on dig about how William Shakespeare used the pronoun they for an individual and now it's coming back. You're talking about gender neutral pronouns. Like William Shakespeare used it because they talked goofy back then they had just invented England. There was a bunch of shitty ways of describing things that we don't do anymore. Thou far out now. Oh, there's a bunch of stupid ways they talked. We realized, Hey, this is a lot of extra sounds we're making with our face and it's not getting the point across any better. It's just dumb. So let's cut the shit and let's clean this fucking bitch out. Modern English is the best English. It's like they got the age gender people that they want everyone to say they until they.

Speaker 1:          00:34:26       Until they tell you their preferred pronoun. Exactly mean like you're fucking a plural. Yeah. When there isn't a single is when you say they. This is where I draw the line. You want to call yourself z. Who goes why? Mr Wiseman. Mr. Okay, but not what do I give a shit? But they would you like teaching people the difference is singular and plural. Plural is they? That's a bunch. That's a few people. They went to the store. It's not a fucking guy. Would you go, well, okay, we'll meet them at the store. No, you meet them at the store. What the fuck you talking about? My meeting them like how many people were there? What, what? What the fuck did you just say? Why don't you say even assuming though that we started using all of these gender pronouns, like Howard, how is anyone even going to keep that straight? Like assume it catches on like wildfire and everyone gets to choose from a list of like 297 genders with their own unique sets of pronouns. Like I can't even remember his pe. Remember people's fucking names. All right. I'm not going to remember that many different sets of pronouns for people. Yeah. It's. I think people try really fucking hard to define themselves because in some way, shape or form, defining yourself helps you feel like you have at least a little bit of sovereignty. This madness

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       that we're all trudging through. I think that's the most interesting thing about you is that you use some weird pronouns then you're not very fucking interests. That's true. That's true. But to those people, it like one of the reasons why they fight for it so viciously. I think for a lot of like really disenfranchised people, they feel so outside of any little victory they can get even in coming up with a new gender pronoun that makes them somehow another field. But it's not a victory though, but it is for them. Maybe it's like a little tiny. I mean, it's not like, oh, like you're not winning the war. Maybe you win a tiny little personal battle, I guess. You know, like, yeah, if you're in other can, every, every person that gets to tell you that you're a dragon, you know, that's just another. Yeah, I'm a dragon.

Speaker 3:          00:36:22       But say I'm a dragon and agree I'm a dragon. The more true it becomes. I think other kin is a very extreme example, that extreme example. But I'm not into, you know, even like all the alternative gender pronouns, you know, and I'm cool with transgender people. I'm cool. But uh, you know, there's not 200 genders there just isn't going to go to that. I want, I want to read this. This is Jamie just put up 2015 word of the year is singular. They says, fucking who you can have a word of the year, asshole. If there's a reason why there's millions of words, because words can only convey a portion of an idea. They string them together and form sentences. You don't get to have a fucking word of the year. That stupid shit that's really fucking dumb. Maybe the word of the year should be as dumb as using the word gay as a singular person because that's not what it is.

Speaker 3:          00:37:13       You fucks. Okay. God Damn it chose pissed. God dammit. Look if because it's unnecessary to. Why would she have a singular? They tell me Your fucking name. Is it pat? Okay, Pat, I don't know if you're a guy or girl. I don't give a fuck. I know I can call you pat. They fuck you. Fuck you. Just fuck you. You're asking for too much goddamn attention. Stop it. They don't. You think? I think America. I speak for you. If Donald Trump speaks for most America, I speak for everybody else. I don't know. He might agree on the whole day thing though. You guys could probably find common ground where, Oh, we'd probably find speak you speak for all of America there. I think we need Donald Trump, but we need Donald Trump on mushrooms. That's what we need. We need a Donald Trump that has a bunch of psychedelic experiences and just releases all this fucking aggressive bullshit and realizes like he's in this unique position to maybe link legitimately changed the world.

Speaker 3:          00:38:12       Can't believe you found mushrooms when he's 65, but now that he did, he knows he's got to do something about this. So give them shrooms and like a spear and set him loose in the woods. Well, you know what happens is Donald Trump has a science advisor. This trying to keep him alive and this an science advisor informs him of the longevity properties of relaxation and that is bound up 10 step thing. One Way to cure this pattern or behavior may be a breakthrough psychedelic experience. So they convinced Mr. Trump to go to like Cedar Sinai or someplace it looks legit and they bring them into a room and they dose the fuck out of him with like 10 grams of mushrooms from Mexico. Just the mothership, hieroglyphs aliens communicating with long, stretchy fingers that go right to his soul and rearrange his synapses and he comes out of that two hours later, a completely different cat.

Speaker 3:          00:39:04       Then we got a real fucking presidential candidate. Then we got somebody. But right now we've got Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And I think Donald Trump's gonna Fuckin. When you think he's going to win, I don't know. This is what I. I don't, I don't know how healthy. And this is a legit question, how healthy Hillary Clinton is. Like there's been some questions about. Apparently she had had a concussion at one point in time and she suffers postconcussion syndrome. Maybe. I don't know if that's true. So it's figuring out what's true and what's not because everything is. So. It might be a rumor that you put a. It was talking to your Jamie earlier about a mine. Well, he's yours, my friend Jamie, Jamie, Jamie. I didn't want to presume, but anyway. No, he was talking to him about. I was talking about how there's just like, there's so much information now that people can just kind of cherry pick whatever they want the truth to be.

Speaker 3:          00:39:57       Yeah. You know, it's, you know, no matter what crazy shit you believe, you can always find someone that's selling that narrative. So that's true. Why not just go with them and say that's the truth and everything else is a lie. That is true. I mean, you can always find support. So it's one of the more interesting things about online communication. When they ask you something, what would you prefer between Hillary and trump? That's a good question. I don't know. I don't know them and it's all. It's like saying like, who would be the better mom? Angela Lansbury or the mom from the Brady bunch. I don't fucking know those people. I don't. I don't know. Who would you rather have as your mom? I don't fucking know. I don't know. I think what you get when you watch Hillary Clinton is a fucking polished politician, a polished lawyer who became a politician who was married to a president who's been secretary of state, just group Frankenstein.

Speaker 3:          00:40:46       She's, you know, she's. She's a deep political person. She's deep. She's deep in the system and in the game, and I think we all can agree whether you're a republican or a Democrat, that the game is fucking rigged. It's rigged. It's rigged in a bunch of real simple ways and a map, a couple of them out real quick that everybody knows the have way too much money that's being spent on these parties by gigantic corporations. Way Too much money, way too much influence. It was way too much cronyism. There's way too many people to become career politicians and they get intertwined and I rubbed my back or rub your back. You Rub my back and they have these weird fucking allegiances and then they have parties to very clear distinct party of Republican or a Democrat and it would take a fucking meteor hitting Virginia for them

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       to elect an independent candidate. I mean, it was some radical fucked up life changing event would have to happen on earth where people woke up out of the fog and realize we have to try for an independent party but don't yet. But even what I was gonna say is the idea, even if there's only three parties is fucking insane. It's insane. The idea that you have three choices and two of them have proven to be inept at managing the country over and over and over and over and over and over again. It's like having Walmart and like JC Penney and they're both selling cancer sticks and everyone's like, you know, art cancer sticks killed way less people than their cancer sticks and then they trade off back and forth. One shitty fucking fast food joint versus another Shitty fucking filling the company Jackie fucking company that's selling you terrible shit. That's what the republic.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       Don't you think it was at least kind of interesting that we have, as you know, out of the three people who stand a good. I mean, I guess you could put crews in there too. You really don't think you as an outlier. He's way too crazy as far as you know, but the people who actually have a stand, a chance of being president, I mean, Hillary, as we've said, is total establishment, whatever. Donald trump, he's really not taking money from others. He's mostly just using his personal fortune at this point, right? Bernie Sanders is not taking money from super pacs. He's just getting funded by, you know, a private citizens and stuff. So to have these people who are so popular or people who have largely issued this system of, uh, the moneyed interests, pumping the, these political campaigns full of money and then expecting, you know, of course their, their core values and return that, that's, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:43:14       So it's kind of interesting that at least we have two candidates that are not part of that. It's a good point, or don't at least seem to be on the surface that are, you know, Bernie Sanders have the second most popular Democrat. He stands a pretty decent chance of winning A. Donald Trump is the most popular republican. He probably will get the nomination if Bernie Sanders just made a little bit more sense about finances. I think I would be in his corner, just don't you like there's a bunch of things that I do like, let me just say what I do like I like what he says about having these people that pay taxes or that I'm shelter their money from taxes by putting them in foreign banks. They should, they should have to pay tax on those and that's bullshit. There's tax shelters that are set up for corporations where a corporation makes billions of dollars and somehow or another they don't pay any taxes.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       That's insanity. That all should be fixed. That, that. And I agree with him 100 percent on that. I agree with him on a living wage and I've had people argue with me about this and you know, say that I need to talk to an economist and maybe they're right, but ideologically maybe they're right financially, but ideologically I think if somebody works for you 40 hours a week, they should be able to eat. They should be able to have a, an apartment to live in. I mean, you should pay someone a living wage. Yeah, a full time worker should definitely have the ability to feed,

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       clothe and shelter themselves. That's seems very reasonable. It should be without debate, right? I mean it should be. We're talking about a person dedicating eight hours of every day of their life. That's a giant chunk of money. Whenever, whenever these, uh, companies crunch the numbers like Mcdonald's, they cry. How much would we have to raise our prices to raise our wages to $15 an hour? It'd be something like, you know, five cents on every big Mac and shit like that. Real. I mean, it's so insignificant. Oh, see, that's just crazy. It's crazy. They won't do that. And you know, furthermore, we've seen, well, you know, we're, we're about to get a big experiment in this in Seattle anyway because they're raising the wages. Well, Seattle is also in the unique position of being at a first year legal marijuana sale and when that, when the taxes came into Denver, I mean it's twisting the whole economy sideways there.

Speaker 3:          00:45:26       Real estate prices have gone through the roof. I think the real estate prices, we're closing in on like 16 percent or more up from the previous year when marijuana wasn't legal there. They're violent crimes kind of way down. Drunk driving is that the lowest? They've had it like 10 years. It's fucking crazy and they've made more money in taxes just in the first year than they did an alcohol. That's. That's insane. More money from marijuana and that state from alcohol. You think about all the places that serve alcohol. That's amazing. Do you think they should take that approach to some of the other drugs that are currently illegal set? One hundred percent, especially the ones that don't kill you, all the ones that you make, any exceptions or would it just across the board the real problem is going to be children. That's the problem. It's a problem now.

Speaker 3:          00:46:11       It's the problem with prescription pills that people leave around. It's a problem with irresponsible folks who leave around potentially dangerous things like a prescription medication or like a bag of mushrooms or coke or something like that. Like, yeah, that's going to be a problem, man. If you make coke legal, if you make it so that you can go and buy coke the same way you can go and buy whiskey, why not tell me why not? I don't understand. Why not. If you want to tell me that alcohol should be illegal as well, then I go, yeah, okay. I get it, but I bet you if you looked at coke versus alcohol, if you look at like daily use of coke versus alcohol, I bet you'd see some real similar like health problems. I bet if it's real similar, I mean it might be even an alcohol might lose.

Speaker 3:          00:46:53       Like alcohol might be worse for you than cocaine. They're both are terrible. No one's advocating them as like a health remedy, but alcohol might be worse than coke, but we still that fucking shit everywhere. Yeah. I pretty much agree with you on that. I think we need adults and children, but let's get back to children. There was something that you didn't just say get. There was things about Bernie Sanders is a economic platform you didn't like. He just said a bunch of crazy shit about marginal tax rate that he didn't think the marginal tax rate is like was it eisenhower had it at 90 percent while he was in office and they asked him if a marginal tax of 90 percent was too high

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       and he said, no. Now, wow, that's 90 percent. Here's the thing about taxes and this is the number one most important point. We're talking here. We're not talking about rich people. Definitely having income equality, having way too much money, way too much influence in changing the laws to make it even easier for them to protect themselves and save money. We're not talking about that. We're talking about taxes and taxes are sneaky because taxes go to the government and the more money the government gets, the bigger it gets. It becomes cancer. It starts fucking growing and swelling and you get bureaucracy and you get red tape and you get a lot of bullshit. If you could ensure that the money was going to these really enlightened people who are super wise and are going to figure out some awesome solutions to reengineer our society and they make poor people happy and well fed, well then yeah, that's a great idea, but until then what you're doing is you just.

Speaker 5:          00:48:20       You're finding successful people and you're taking more from them like you're cutting away incentive incentive. You're cutting away this ability to get to the place where you could buy an island. You're saying you shouldn't be able to do that. Well, I don't know if you can do cocaine every day of your life or you can bust your ass and develop a company like Google and then buy a fucking island that's also in the game. It's in the game. It doesn't necessarily mean you're evil and this idea that because someone figures out how to do it and I'm talking about only ethically and within the boundaries of the rules. I think the issue that Bernie says that I agree with is people that don't work within the boundaries of the rules that we all agreed on and they've figured out all these sneaky fucking loopholes and it essentially bribed politicians to making it easier for them to move money around and not pay taxes on things.

Speaker 5:          00:49:09       I'm with him 100 percent on that, but the. I don't think the answer is taxing the fuck out of people, I think, and he's going to have to tax the middle class higher too. He's admitted that when he goes over his life. Sure. It's crazy. Plan you should take. People don't need to be taxed more. We need to do is figure out a responsible method of managing the money that we already fucking pay you guys. That's way better than taking more. That's way better than taking more so when someone says they want to see more taxes, I go, stop with this talk. You're doing a shitty job of managing all the money people are giving you right now. How about figure that out first? Yeah, I mean you're definitely right and I'm running for office. Jamie, you're gonna run for office, fire it up to Jay. Got Me fired up. I don't usually get this fired up about something I think is a rigged game.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       Well, it turned progress. Turned you into a believer in a ways. A little bit. But let me tell you this. I mean, I agree with you, but I mean, um, you know, government, I mean the government program, there's definitely some government programs that produce results and have efficacy and shit. Yes. But you know, you're right, there's, there's too much bureaucracy, there's too much. There's too many things where everything is just fucking in disarray. Like the va and Shit, you know, there's, there was so many files in one va building that the building was actually collapsing, you know, just under the weight of all these files upon

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       files. So you know, it, it is kind of hard to argue that more money needs to be spent when the situation is like that. What's also going to the irs and the irs is. But I mean there's so many tactics before. There's so many problems though in this country that really do need to be resolved. Like our infrastructure is shit and no one wants to talk about infrastructure because it isn't boring fucking topic. No one wants to talk about the bridges and roads crumbling and shit. No, it's good point. That's a very good point. You know, the architects and engineers been telling us for years, our, our, uh, our grades and infrastructure are fucking d's and f's. We're not doing great. You know, I grew up in Boston or costs a lot of money to fix it is. I grew up in Boston and Boston had the big dig.

Speaker 1:          00:51:09       Do you remember that? That's also one thing I like about trump. By the way. He, that he has seems to be committed to rebuilding America's infrastructure. That's one thing I will give him. That is true. Well, he's, he's going to take a radical approach that's different from the radical approach of Bernie Sanders to, in my opinion, those are the two that are most interesting to me. Unless someone can prove to me that Hillary Clinton is not totally healthy and, and cheese. Um, and that also she's not just some robot monster. That's what she is though. She's color Schullery. You don't think she's interested in her? I think she's pure. I mean like I've been. Maybe I would be interested in her if I could look beneath the mask, if I could see who she actually is the person and get a sense of a human being that resides within this completely fake exterior with just to be just a place to advocate because I kept doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       Do it. How hard is it to be fucking Hillary Clinton? It's probably brutal. The scrutiny that she gets to the constant attention, the people like she probably has to put up a wall just to get through life, you know? I mean, her behavior as a politician probably mimics her behavior as a person. Look at the amount of Shit Donald trump gets about to recommend mushrooms to Hillary and Donald together. Look at Donald Trump gets one thing that Donald Trump. He takes criticism way better than Hillary because Donald Trump's response to criticism is like, I don't give a fuck. Fuck you. Right. Hillary Clinton tries to project this image of being this flawless being that never makes a mistake, and even if you think she did, you're mistaken, you're wrong to Donald Trump on mushrooms with Mexicans in Mexico, so he gets a deep love of Mexico. I just fuck this border. He just goes, fuck this border.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       Why do we have a border? Fuck, let's just have all the same money and no border. Boom, the gates open, legalized and legalize mushrooms and weed, and you would have liked the cartel would have zero power. They would go under or they would be significantly. We wonder what the result would be of trying to merge the dollar and the peso together in norland currency. Well, white dudes were to explode all over the country. You would have white, white fat guys with like loose skin screaming at the top of their lungs like that movie scanners. I love that. Why? If they open up the fucking borders, oh my God, it would be amazing. It'd be. It'd be great. It would be. It really would. It would be great. People need to stop just as long as you don't let any Canadians in federal law. They would make it way more polite.

Speaker 1:          00:53:40       I'll tell you what. Are we in Canada? One of the other. Now there's less of them, so I think that we would just make them rude, obnoxious assholes like us. Um, I don't know, man. They're pretty firmly established as nice folks. They are so much nicer than Americans. I would say Canadians are 20 percent nicer. Yeah. I've, uh, I've met some Canadians, so I would agree. It's weird. They're strange country though. When you first go waiting, like going from Boston to Montreal. I'm waiting for like the true people to come out. My can we, you guys are in the cold to how come you're not a bunch of evil cunt like me. You can find mean people everywhere. Sure. But the difference between the way people behaved in Montreal versus the way people behaved in Boston, I was like, oh, how weird. Well, Boston's like very aggressive.

Speaker 1:          00:54:27       Yeah, it's like known for that. Yeah. It's boat people. People that came over on boats drunk. They crashed their 200 years ago. They stayed and they fuck they had kids ruined their lives. They had kids ruin their lives and now here they are right now, a few, four or five generations later, maybe three. I should point out that, um, the Boston accent is one of the most horrible sounds to my ears. It's disgusting. It's really wretched. I had one for awhile because I was uh, you know, when I moved to, um, hear it anymore, but I hear it occasionally if I have a couple of drinks, a word will come out. But I heard myself a talk once and I was like, what? I heard like a recording and I was like, what the fuck? That's what I sound like. I didn't realize I sounded like that.

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       So I made a concerted effort to stop speaking like that where could really hard and had oh, stop things that they all talk like that. It's a monsters. Don't do it, but it's fun. I'll tell you what though. It's funny when it comes out of comedian, I'll tell you what though. I'm my, my southern accent will come out if I'm angry or I'm really drunk. Yeah. Got To just do y'all, did y'all ever come out of your mouth? Oh yeah. I'll say y'all. Even even without speaking in a southern southern affectation, I'll still use y'all because I think. Yeah, I actually will make an argument for y'all because you know, it is actually easier than it's, it's, it's a, it's a legitimate contraction. You all, y'all, I mean know there's no a in in you, but whatever. You know what I like to know y'all, it seems to buy pasta all.

Speaker 1:          00:56:06       It seems to be almost always friendly. It is like, you know, y'all gonna get killed. That's not even in that context. It sounds friendly. Fucked up. I guess you could say it like that, but it's like, but it's more like what y'all doing, you know, like everybody's like casual. It's a casual word. Well, it's the difference between the black and the white. Y'All, you know, what are you doing? Getting racist here and a little bit, just a Smidgen. Listen, if there are any differences between black people and white people, I'd like you to not address those because those in faculty be microaggressions. Well, do you not know about microaggression? I do know about microaggressions. I mean, it's a white male. You're a walking microaggressions. True. It's true. How dare you. But you know, black dudes have bigger dicks so they don't ever know. They don't object to that one.

Speaker 1:          00:56:52       That is microaggression. Black men, they never backed black men that are like, they have that expectation. What if white men or white women, either one only go out with them because they expect the big black Dick and meanwhile these guys, they, they dread, they live in fear of the moment. They have to put out their normal cock. Well, all they gotta do is when they whip it out and be like, surprise bitch, that'll work. Once it will work, it'll work more than once. We'll work on different people, but you're going to have to get to that position over and over and over again. That's the hardest position. I guess you'll just have to get by on personality or something. Boy, you're asking a lot. I have to do it. I'm not working with much. How did you start making these youtube videos?

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       Um, well, you know, it's funny, I was, I was there, I was there from almost the beginning. I'm the one of the few people that still from the old youtube because when did you start? Uh, nine years ago. Wow. Two thousand seven. Two Thousand and eight Christ. That's how long youtube tube's been around. Yeah. While, and, but I mean it's not that long at all. Yeah. Well to me it seems like a really long time. That's a, you know, I think it started in 2006 or something, so I wasn't there from the very beginning. But everyone who was big at the time, I don't think any of them are big now. I think they're all gone. So I mean it seems like the shelf life of a youtube channel is pretty short, so I'm glad I've been around this entire time. Yeah. But I mean I guess I just started because I went on there, I was already being like a fucking asshole atheist troll to people in like Internet forums and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:58:28       So a bunch of people, they like the way I wrote, they told me I should take my, you know, I should take it on youtube and I was Kinda like, Eh, I don't know, I don't really feel like I have much of a camera presence or whatever, but I, I, I went on youtube and I made a horrible, horrible fucking video that is just wretched in every way. And you know, I walk around my garage talking in this monotone voice like this, but for some reason some people liked it and uh, I kept doing it and I got a little bit more natural in front of the camera as I stopped treating it. Like, I dunno, I started treating it more like a person or a friend. And uh, over time it just, I don't know, I've never been like the biggest channel on youtube or anything, but it's just always been consistently successful. Consistently grows consistently, seems to keep pace with, you know, whatever the standard of being on the lower end of the

Speaker 3:          00:59:21       popularity scale of youtube is. Well, I feel like youtube in particular, it's one of those things where if you do a show like yours, what's really important is consistency. You've got to do it a lot so that people get addicted to it and you also just have to put a lot of effort into it. And those are two things that you do, you know, you're really consistent, you put a lot of videos and I try, you obviously have like really well thought out points of view in these things and you argue them well and, and in a funny way, you know, and that's kind of interesting that before youtube and before the Internet I got like, you would have struggled to find a forum, like if you wanted to go to some television production company and go, Hey, my name's Tj, you know, I live in Blah Blah Blah, and I'm but thinking about doing this thing where I just fucking turn a camera on me and I just say what I feel about shit. Like yeah, that sounds great tj. Get the fuck Outta here. Get outta here man. And watch that piece of shit. We know how many millions of views do you have on your Youtube Channel? High average. Four to 5 million views a month.

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       Yeah. Fucked up NBC. You fucked up. I could have got four or $5 million views a month. What are you doing instead? What do you got instead? Huh? What kind of bullshit. And you sell in America right now.

Speaker 2:          01:00:32       But you know, the, the weird thing about the whole youtube thing is though, I mean I have two successful channels now. I have the amazing atheist channel, which is the older channel. I have the drunken peasants, a podcast channel. I'm doing kind of what you were doing. Um, and that's doing well. That's only a couple of years old, but you know, I was thinking if, if, if it weren't for Youtube, I mean before when I was a kid, I used to want to either be a writer and really it was writing that Kinda got me into doing youtube anyway because I was just like a forum troll that would argue with people on the Internet. I had no fucking life. Right? Um, well because it's exciting. It's fun, it's fun for me and I like pushing buttons. It pissing people off, you know, I'll say things just to piss people off.

Speaker 2:          01:01:15       Of course, you know, and um, you know, I do that. I mean I guess that probably I would've had to try to be a comedian or something, but when you were there in the day with flame wars, I wouldn't want to be a comedian though because I don't want to have to always be funny. I don't want to feel pressure. Like everything I say has to be a fucking joke, you know? Well it only does on stage, you know, I know that. But I mean I, I don't want the, I don't want people to think that the performance has to be about laughter or whatever you're producing, whether it's a song of the cast stuff. I try to be funny. Another thing though is, you know, it's a lot harder to gauge whether people are finding it funny or not because you know, I don't have a live reaction to what I'm saying. So sometimes some shit that I think is really funny, people would be like, this video was cringe or something, you know? I'm like, Oh fuck, I guess I will. That's always going to be. The king wasn't as funny as I thought I bombed. While you're also dealing with a. what's the sample group? What percentage of people leave comments? Is it even one? It might not even be one tiny. It's a tiny in that sample. It's a tiny percentage of people that write the videos. It's a percentage of people that

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       comment on the videos. Most people they just watched. They don't interact in any way whatsoever, so it's impossible to know what they think, but you know, they keep coming back so they must see something. They're like, well, and the people that are fine, like the one thing you said that piss them off, that makes them go on this rant about it. You should die in the fucking car accident. Those those people, like you're missing the whole point of what one of these things is like if you have a different point of view, you should establish your own channel and you should go fucking make your own videos about it man, and if you can even link to them in a reply video, you could say, you know, fuck face made a reply to Tj and you know, this is what I think about you and your fucking shitty atheists ideas and when Jesus does come back, make a video man, make a video.

Speaker 3:          01:03:02       And that's the interesting thing about today is that someone can do that. Well, the problem is they try and no one cares. Yeah, well it's way easier to critique than it is to do obviously. Yeah, it's very easy to sit there and say you're an idiot and everything you do is wrong. To actually do what I do and be successful at it, it's a little harder. The problem is like to really critique someone. If someone's critiquing someone, I can read their words and I can try to think if make it make sense to me and it might make sense, but I don't know them and that is, that is a problem because if I don't know them or I don't know their work, like if they're an artist, like I say Michael Stipe or someone like that from rem writes something about someone, I go, hmm, well he seems to be a weird, interesting Kinda guy.

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       I wonder if I would agree with his opinions on things and wonder if his perspective is skewed. What? What does it do? His words represent honesty or is there some sort of emotional imbalance that he's a who? What is, what does that, what is actually going on? Unless you know someone, it's hard. Why? Like why is he getting mad at the amazing atheist? What is what's going on? Which I wish more people would think like that. I'm like, why is he so angry at you? Why? Why? Why is he threatening you? Why you freak out? People don't get mad about ideas that they think are wrong. They get afraid of ideas they think might be right. That's a big part of it. You know, and, and when you, when I'm someone who will come out there and just brazenly say that someone's most deeply cherished beliefs are just wrong and stupid, you know, of course people are getting upset.

Speaker 3:          01:04:34       Of course people are going to have the reaction of, Oh my God, this guy, he's obnoxious. He's an asshole. He's an idiot. Which all might be true, but I still don't think there's a god. Um, do you think there's no god or do not believe in God? I don't think we even got. Yeah, I think there's a difference. Right? So you don't have a thing and let people go with WHO's not you fucking more. You're atheist. Bullshit. Let's just, let's just follow me for a second here. I think there's one thing if you believe in God, okay. If you believe in God, you are essentially, you're, you're believing in something that you have no evidence of. There's no proof of it. There's no direction that points to it. There's certainly some weird stuff going on in the universe. The Universe is fascinating, matter itself is a wonderful.

Speaker 3:          01:05:17       It's amazing. It's incredible, incomprehensible, incomprehensible and infinite, right? But believing in something that you have no evidence is very different than not believing in something because when you say you don't believe in God, it doesn't mean that there's no god, but there's no evidence of it whatsoever. I've never seen anything like if you and I die and we're in heaven and I'm like, Tj, can you fucking believe this shit? Be like, Holy Shit, we were so stupid. High Five, you know? I mean, if there is a wonderful, beautiful God that's all about love and created the universe, by the way, he's going to know that you didn't know and he's not going to be mad at you. That's like a friend not knowing when you're. You don't know where they're from. You don't know when their birthday is, so they come over your house and beat the fuck out of you because you didn't say happy birthday.

Speaker 3:          01:06:06       He's like, dude, I didn't know you didn't tell me. Well, that's what. What? By God not being here to tell us all this stuff. Most people, most people think that God is a is a dick. I mean, most people who believe in God, they called themselves God fearing, you know, they don't. I'm sure there are. There are people who preach about a god of love and forgiveness and all this shit, but most of these people preach about a God that expects you to blindly believe in him or suffer eternal torment forever in hell and be tortured. It's nonsense, but we don't know what happens when we die. It's really that simple. It could be just like a DMT trip. It could be like a completely new DMT is released in the brain when people die. Yeah. During moments of heavy stress when your body feels like it's going to die.

Speaker 3:          01:06:49       Um, and we, we even know now, thanks to the work of this guy, Dr Rick Strassman who wrote that book, the spirit molecule spirit molecule. It's amazing. He wrote, he, they did these clinical trials out of the University of New Mexico and he documented it in this book or they're administering DMT intravenously, really fucking wild shit. But he's got this thing called the cottonwood research foundation where they're trying to do more dmt studies and one of the things they've found is that they've isolated one of these universities that mice produce dmt in their pineal gland. Like that is a fact now. Whereas before it was just anecdotal evidence that pointed to that. So like the seed of the soul, the third, I like all that. Like the, this gland in the center of your brain really is the DMT factory, which is what you know, ancient people have been saying forever.

Speaker 3:          01:07:38       I mean that's the third eye from eastern mysticism. That is, that's what it represents. So that is supposedly what we release our brain releases when we die, which is really amazing if you stop and think about it or if you've had a dmt trip, but it might not even be that about this. That might be just the doorway that gets you to diapers and all of a sudden you wake up and you're a fucking baby again. You got to do this shit all over again. You got to live as Tj and you've got to do the same fucking life. Your parents make the same moves. Your Dad, mom gets a voice at the same time. This, this is like a Nietzschean ideal of eternal recurrence. Why not? If existence kid

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       can be real. If the hold on a second, if these actual distance of us talking, sitting here know airplanes landing, all these things take place. Why can't it take place in an infinite number of times? It could, you know, but that's kind of, that's kind of a, the one of the most compelling arguments to live an interesting life if you're going to have to actually go through it over and over and over again in exactly the same fashion with nothing different or not. Or maybe you do get to change, I don't know. But that concept of living the same life over and over again is um, that's been around a long time. But actually a word for it, full disclosure though, my belief is generally that when I'm, when I'm dead, I'm just going to blink out of existence. But why do you believe that?

Speaker 1:          01:08:56       I just don't understand you believing that you don't have any information, but I couldn't understand you believe in result. The reason I believe that is because I think that my consciousness has seated within my brain and that my brain is unique to this time and place, and that even if it were to be recreated identically, you know, right next to me, that still wouldn't be me because there's, there's still a separation there. You're not a clone of yourself. I think that, you know, uh, but I, I kind of try to live in the eternal presence, you know, just, that's good. That's smart. I don't believe in a, I don't believe. I think that, you know, if you were to pull out a gun and shoot me in the head that it would be the end of my existence. I would never form another thought. I would never have another experience.

Speaker 1:          01:09:42       I can't prove that though. It's totally just what I believe. It's totally possible that you're right, it's, but it's also compelling the idea that what the brain is is the universe finding a way to imagine itself in a physical three dimensional form. That's what the brand represents and that this dimension that we exist in right now, solid things is just one of an infinite number of possibilities that exist all throughout the cosmos and that what we're experiencing right now is the body, the physical embodiment of life, multicellular structures coming together and forming these coalitions, which is essentially what your body is, right? There's all this bacteria and all this different shit that's going on and then it has to take in life foods and enzymes and creates this environment, this in its most advanced form, at least as far as its ability to manipulate your house right now.

Speaker 1:          01:10:40       Have you ever heard Howard blooms the frames or. I'll forget it. Okay, good. What did I say? Fuck, sorry. But, uh, you're talking about a lot of stuff that my friend Howard Bloom has written about in a book he wrote called the global brain that basically talks about exactly that coalescence of, you know, a single bacteria to a biofilm, a bacterial colonies, to an organism, to organisms getting together and forming societies. And you know, it's, it's all about how, you know, we, we, we're, we're climbing this ladder of connectivity and you know, like Los Angeles is a good example at you. You kind of likened it in a video I saw of yours to the mold eating the sandwich, you know, we're, we're kind of that force because humanity is like a super organism and we've built this crazy large society that no other ape species on the planet has been able to come close to.

Speaker 1:          01:11:37       Well that was the concept was that it's all moving towards this ultimate goal of things being more and more complex. Right? Well, while that's happening, the brain, which is what the human uses to go through this experience could have been created like over time and through all these advancements for, for the universal sort of experiencing itself for the universe to imagine itself and what we're doing as these weird organisms that changed things as we're, we're, we're designing something, we're building towards something. There's no question that if things continue to get more and more complex, which we are fucking starving for, we're constantly thirsty for new inventions. Innovation. That's what everybody wants and no one wants like a static world. No one says, hey, everything we have right now technologically is perfect. We need to stop spending money on research and inventions. Let's just have joy.

Speaker 1:          01:12:30       All the shit we have and just be nice to each other. That's not what we're interested in at all. But so if you look at us objectively, if you like, pull back and go, what is this thing doing? Like what is this thing doing? This thing is constantly getting better at getting closer together and it by combining people and electronics, combining people and technology. I mean the dinosaurs could have had that perspective though, like yeah man, we're built into like bigger and better dinosaurs one day. It's just going to be the biggest ultimate dinosaur that rules the universe or something. You know? Instead they went extinct. Yeah, but they got hit with a rock cheating. If you fire like it's cheating. If you find like a cannon ball, I mean if it's going up and up and up, you might make the mistake of saying this is always going to go up and up and up and then, you know, eventually gravity catches up with it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:19       I just don't think we could take it for granted that we have some sort of great destiny on the horizon. I think, you know, it's up to us to make that happen, but I don't think we can take it for granted. Oh, definitely not. No one's suggesting that definitely can't. I don't think it has to work out. Look, here's a fucking gigantic super volcano under yellowstone. Could easily blow up and killed. Basically everybody on the continent as close to it. That fucker blows. This is a global extinction event. I mean this, this. Could they think that that one that blue was at in Indonesia, chop the human race down to just a few thousand people 70,000 years ago. They think it might have been as few as 2000 people left. Well, the real detriment is the clouds blocking out the sun. Exactly. Lack of food. Photosynthesis. No vegetables, fucking serious climate change, very, very drastic, very, very cold, real cold, real quick, no food and a lot of people are going to die of sickness and illness.

Speaker 1:          01:14:15       Yeah, it's a super volcano. Could fuck up everything and then that's the argument that a lot of people have made as far as people that have looked to try to revise those current model of history based on cataclysmic events like look back and say, well, you know, there's a lot of these cultures that created these incredible stone structures. Like maybe they died off because some shit happened like he couldn't get. It might not have just been disease. There might be like a series of media impacts. Super volcanoes, all sorts of different. There's like shit that can happen to this world all the time. California is due for an earthquake at any moment. This we can be sitting here doing this podcast and any moment a nine kid hit and half a fucking Malibu could slide right into the ocean and waves a hundred feet high can just roll three, four miles in.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       At least. It'd be an interesting episode. It would be a dope podcasts, but I think, well, we figured we need a battery. Joe Rogan goes screaming into the abyss of the earth. We need a battery backup. We're strategically far away from the, uh, from the ocean for that reason. Oh, you're saying, okay, you've thought of this. You've planned. I had been thinking about setting up shop in downtown La. Man. I have this weird compelling notion to try to get to downtown La and set something up in there like put, put together a studio in downtown. It just seems like a spot to go to right now. Like I'm drawn to it like the ring, you know what I'm saying? Ring of power. Yeah. Well which are on, was using it for something about, uh, going there. But that's a high enough to have a good vantage point to see the waves come in and know that you can't get it out of the way.

Speaker 1:          01:15:50       And I don't know, I just don't plan for stuff like that. I figured if I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die. I'm not going to try to avert some unlikely fate of the tsunami waves. I mean, you know, I figured like if that's what's going to kill me, I'll just stand out there and I'll look at them and I'll be like, alright, embrace me. Death. Right. Like the final scene of deep impact. Yeah. You know, just fucking like. Except that shit. Don't be trying to. Fuck. I'm going to watch from above is all the fucking stupid people drown. Told you it was going to happen. You morons will. That would be a lot like walking dead, right? Yeah. Like the, the people that are free are the people that are dead. The people that are trapped in this shitty world surrounded by flesh eating monsters. Those are the people that are alive.

Speaker 1:          01:16:33       The of live fucked up. That's why they did that whole like play on words with that one episode where he's like, we are the walking dead, you know? Oh yeah. I see a twisted it around. Subverted expectation was fleshed out that no, I pretended it didn't happen. It happened. It was beautiful. Do you watch the new walking dead? No. It's really fucking good. Is it because I heard bad things? How dare those people? Those people suck and those people don't know shit. I'm addicted to that show and I know that sometimes it's pretty hokey and cheesy, but I do like it. I like it too. I liked both of them, but the new one is way more like a movie or way more like maybe a netflix show. Whereas the old ones seems like an NBC show. Yes. I love about the walking dead is that every episode is just like, what?

Speaker 1:          01:17:18       Miserable Shit. We're all characters go through next and then it's just like misery, executive object, fucking horror, terror. Just no moment of goodness. And even if there is, it's just so it can be taken away, you know, and you know, that kind of makes people feel better about their, their actual lives I think. I think a lot of the sjw types around the Internet need to get into that show. So people who have a real life, it's a social justice warrior. It's what he's referring to when he says asj w dot m r a. that's not one said really. Anyone on the Internet knows what I'm talking about, but there's a lot of people that are not on the Internet. They're just getting this podcast. We have to help them. Lucky them. We have to help them. I don't want it. If they don't know what a fucking sjws don't do them the disservice of telling them what you said Mra earlier, which allowed people's rights, activist or advocate. Right. I guess it can be advocate to. I've always heard activists, but it basically means like men are oppressed in America. It's both. It's like, oh my God, shut up. Yeah. It's not a good position to be in, but

Speaker 1:          01:18:22       we, we, we discussed their valid thing. It's easy. It's easy to mock. It's easy to mock it up. Exactly. But what that was, you know, uh, my, my whole point was like, a men's rights activist would want to support you when you were being sexually harassed by that super horny. Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm biting the hand. They should potentially feed. Called a couple friends. Had A fucking gang. Bang. That crazy bitch. That's what you should've done. She's like, you all right. You want to fuck, here's some guys that are down to fuck with wish she'd be like to kind of grow. Whereas those weird fucking stockings connected with rubber bands for some reason. Why is that hot when they have the stocking and it's got like strap and like you've got a harness and shit like you're ready to go. Fucking parasailing. Like why? Why is that hot? Those. What are those called? Garter straps. Are Gardeners started or something? What the fuck is that? Why is that hot? Because that's what you're dirty boss would have. That's what she would have those, you just see it in a lot of movies and shit too. You know why? Because that way they can fuck without taking their panties down because their panties only go up to like mid high. And then above that it's all just meat

Speaker 1:          01:19:28       almost. I was uh, you know, there was probably a racist reasons why I didn't want to get with her too. She wasn't, she's black and she's, Oh, well you're a racist. Dare you. That's the real. That's the real problem here. God Damn it. You have a lot of problems. I know I'm just, I'm racist, I'm sexist. I'm just a horrible person. Um, if she was white, you think you'd fuck her? Maybe. Wow. Damn. I know you're not allowed to have that preference. I'll just let you know. That's racist. Well, I like Brazilian girls better than white girls. Too Racist to maybe she moved to Brazil. Maybe should get the fuck out of my own because I don't like crushing poverty either. So. Oh well. Maybe you can go over there and find a nice gal. Yeah. And treat her for the wonderful life that you live on.

Speaker 1:          01:20:09       Being a youtube star. Yeah, we can do that. Do you ever like go back and forth with any girls from there that are desperate to leave now? I'm not. I'm not suave enough for that endeavor. If this woman was like a really hot, like stone cold Russian lady and she kept grabbing. Yeah. I was thinking I should know just like really sexy but strong. A kind of scary but still really. Okay. I'm talking about you're talking about like, uh, like that chick from rocky for. Yeah. Who still owned while up Marion diddy. He married her. Bridgette Nielsen? Yeah. She was a fucking giant Uber woman. Yeah. I like that. Yeah, I do. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking. Things would have played out differently. Totally different. It's just not in the blank checks, but that's okay. I am now. Just not then. Well, you know what man?

Speaker 1:          01:20:55       Why is it a bad thing to not be sexually into whatever. I don't like meat. Maybe it'd be like you don't like skinny women. You don't like tall women. You don't like short. It's not a preference issue. Like are you allowed to say sexually you you're not attracted to black women or a black man. Are you allowed to say that or is that racist? It's racist. That's weird. It's considered racist. It's only about sex as a thing. If you're a lover as a human being. If you go to the SJ W, which our audiences just learned what that means, circles, then it's racist. If you're in the MRA circles than it's not so raised, then I'm on their side now among them that I will admit it's easier to take their side, but I still just think there's too much of this. I'm a victim. Feel sorry for me.

Speaker 1:          01:21:43       Give me special rights. Give me special privileges. I just tired of that line. I mean, look, we had people that were oppressed groups in America for a long time. No one denies it, but I mean, is that really still the case? Like she'll give me. I always asked feminists, like, tell me an objective objectively provable, right? Give me a right that I have that you don't have. And it's just silence. Like, well, uh, you know, oh, what about the wage gap? Wage gap. There's no, there's no right. There's lots, but don't just don't remember though. Like there was a wage gap. You know, you already know this. Somebody wrote this down and just don't say it. The wage gap is real. Guys. Just stop that space. You know what? Can't argue with those facts. I've done some research, I've discovered that in certain industries there are wage gaps, there are individual wage gaps in certain industries.

Speaker 1:          01:22:39       Like what industries are our primary. I don't remember off the top of my head. I think a real estate and stuff like that, but I mean that could in real estate's a weird one though because it kind of depends on how successful you are at it. You know, it's, it's not like you're going in and doing a nine to five and get into fucking salary. I know a dude who bought a house and the girl who was selling the house was hot and he was a single guy and he showed up at the house and this bitch was in the tub naked.

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       That's one way to sell a house. There used to be able to do that in the early two thousands. My friend for fucking social media ruined that party. You know, he'll blow her shit on facebook and ruin her life. She's just trying to get freaky and sell a house. Maybe get some Dick, catch some of that loose dick. This float around when you're a hot real estate agent, why not? I want to share levels or no bubbles. I envisioned bubbles. Bubbles is bubbles is the move. Yeah, but it's pretty gangster to go fucking straight, naked. Clear in native. I think it's better if there's bubbles because then she stands up and then the bubbles kind of run down her body, you know? Well, then also might be a decision of whether or not she could become your woman. Like she could be your girlfriend or your wife if she has bubbles.

Speaker 3:          01:23:49       Like this pitch just loved me and she took a chance. She's crazy. We went for it and now she's so fun and spontaneous. We get along great, but if you show up and she's just cudi ass naked, he wouldn't be like, this bitch is crazy. I gotta get Outta here. I can't buy a house from her. She's going to know my number. You know, like you might immediately think she's so nuts. She took off her clothes and now she's in fucking pussy soup over here. Why there's got to be bubbled. She's making a big cup of asshole tea and she wants me to come over and look into it like, get, get dressed. I want to buy a house. You want to go out for a drink? We'll go out for a drink. Um, some other time, but not if there's bugs. Show me the fucking floor.

Speaker 3:          01:24:28       Pennants word. Jesus Christ. What's the inspection look like? I would think she's trying to distract me. I can try to distract me. What did the inspector said? These, this fucking house. I've termites. Crazy bitch house could be falling apart all around you. Just like, Damn. It could be right. We don't know. We don't know shit man. She's distracting me. It's sexual. She's sexually harassing you, right? Because you didn't request this sexually distracting you and she's using her sexuality to distract you from the world around you. Let's keep you from making good decisions. Let's flip it. Let's flip it. What if you are a young, attractive woman and you show up and you're trying to buy a house and you hear, oh, c'mon. And Debbie, I'm upstairs and you go up. I'm Mike. You looking for the real estate agent, you're a little person, you're holding onto your iphone, checking the text message, make sure you've got the right place and you opened the door and this dude's got a fucking rod and he's sitting there.

Speaker 3:          01:25:20       It's poking out like a periscope. I was thinking the same thing. Call the fucking police right away. Even if he had bubbles. Is he naked? No, I'm calm. I'm wearing bubble bath. You don't where bubbles are there? It'd be like a court case. Was he naked, ma'am? I was not naked. You could not see me. What? Are you naked in the water, sir? No, I was wearing bubbles. That is not clothing. Who are you to decide what clothing is made up? I was making. So I was wearing something that does that. It, it hit me in a modest way. You could not see my genitals and uh, I feel like I was okay. Why would, your honor, why would it be okay if he had a towel on? But it's not okay if it's got bubbles, doesn't tell them bubbles to the same fucking thing. I don't know if she would immediately call the police. I think she would probably just scream and leave.

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       I call the police. I'd say no, I press nine slash 11. While I was in the house. I'd be like, I'm looking right at this guy's Dick. This is not cool. It's not even. His house is freaky fucker wants to take baths and some houses that. I mean, what is she? What is. She was in it, but what if she just showed up and she's like, Ooh, Dick. Because when. What would you think at that point? Well then you're good. You know, as long as that happens. But that's pretty unlikely though. Yeah. That's like $100 off the ball ticket ever fucking made off. The chances are that crazy, but they're close. Think it's one and $292 million that she'll jump on the deck. If you didn't know the guy and you just showed up and his dick was poking out of the water, you'd probably assume that was the last few hours of your life you would run and expect to immediately run into a guy wearing a fucking hood.

Speaker 1:          01:26:46       You know, like you, you standing in the next room like this, I'm going to die today. I'm, I'm a young girl. I can't protect myself physically from this guy with his heart on and who knows how we set this up and who other. Who else is in this building wants to chop me up and burned me in the woods. So I would assume, I don't think they need to. They don't want to chop her up. You know, sometimes they do though. You just fucking has a big Dick. He wants to maybe do something maybe. Or maybe she walked into a fucking trap and this guy's like, Charles Manson, you're always assuming the worst about matt, about meme man. You know he guys, some guy sitting there in a truck with a big erection. He wants to chop her up and fuck it. Barrier in the woods.

Speaker 1:          01:27:25       Some woman's in the tub, she just wants to suck this guy's Dick and show him the time of his life and maybe sell them a house. Do you not watch TV? What you're saying? That's what I'm saying is not normal. I think it is pretty normal. I think that's probably how most people would think about it. Yeah, I think so too, man. Why maybe the MRI's, MRI's, MRI's, men's rights informant. Hey, I just want to tell you these fucking men on this side plot and some shit. They're going to troll your forums. That's. That would be a men's right informant or a rat for the men's right organization that tries to befriend feminists to get close to them. I try to try to be there. Their lovers. Would it be, uh, would it be um, a men's with the men's rights informant be someone who's a coil to the men's rights movement and trying to gather intel on feminists or reporting Intel on the men's rights movement back to feminine?

Speaker 1:          01:28:19       That's a very good point. It could because I could see it going either way. They're bright. You could totally see like a guy pretending to be a social justice warrior who becomes a male feminist and he uses hashtag feminism on his twitter page and he makes videos about feminism, but really what he's doing is trying to get deep, deep, deep into the roots of the organization. His ultimate goal is to get a position with someone like who's that woman you were talking about earlier before what Anita Sarkeesian got one, like one of those like one of the queen bees get very close to her and perhaps maybe help write some of her stuff or perhaps get closer and closer to the organization to maybe perhaps he could have some influence or find out their strategies and then what he does in the clan to Stein arrangement. Whereas the fucking black peacoat and fucking

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       a wool cap and he meets on the docks with the. A real man and the real man is like, what are these cons planning? And he's like, oh, I'll tell you right now. And he and he becomes a men's right in form it. There you go. Could be one of both things. This could be a movie. I would say it would most likely go the other way though. I would doubt. I would doubt a guy would be able to even keep the job if he was a real. A real man. That's right. I said it a real man that goes deep into the heart of the Social Justice Warrior movement just to befriend feminists, to try to be their allies. A real man would get sick to his stomach and a very short amount of time. You think so? Most likely, unless they had really good points, in which case they probably would just be egalitarianism.

Speaker 3:          01:29:41       It wouldn't really be necessarily feminine, would probably be this thing. They'd probably just be folks that didn't want to get fucked with, which is everybody, which is all humans, you know, but men's rights act. That's what I wonder though. Why is it, why is it a. Why isn't it okay to just be like, how about everyone just treats everyone okay? Should be like, why can't. What is it? Why is that such a controversial idea? Why when you present that to a feminist, like let's just be gender, egalitarianism, egalitarian, and all other ways and you know, as long as someone's not hurting you or you're not hurting them, you could just do whatever the fuck you want and you know, you would think that that would be a perfectly reasonable proposition for any human being of any ideology. But it seems like it's rejected so roundly by so many people all the fucking time, like, no, we don't want to do that.

Speaker 3:          01:30:25       We want to have our stupid little ideological clique's and be like, yeah, we're the feminist and where are the Mras? And we're gonna have some lame Internet fight until the end of time and annoy the shit out of everybody. Well, I think, I honestly believe this all bullshit aside. I think people are way better at communicating now than they've ever been before and I think we're going through some growing pains and I think that's what a lot of this stuff is. My, my honest belief is that what we're looking at winn block watch captain Kirk Duke it out with that stupid fake lizard is very similar in a cultural context like that's art. That's like a piece of art that was on television. That's unacceptable today. Well, there's also communication that was normal back then. That's unacceptable today and I think along the way there's some battles and some some lines get crossed and some boundaries get established and I think that's exactly what we're going through right now.

Speaker 3:          01:31:19       When you blame men for everything and then you won't talk about the real issues like your issue because you're a male, you're getting sexually harassed as inconsequential as compared to a woman who was in the same situation or whether it's divorce laws or whether it's alimony or whether it's child support or whether it's custody of the children. As soon as you have a male versus female perspective and you ignore the enormous gigantic range of people that exist on the female and the male side, they're so different. Everyone's so goddamn different to to have an ATM or aB team. I think it's becoming more and more preposterous and I think that's sort of been highlighted by why we can so freely talk about this. We're mining so much humor and goofing on these people so easily because it's so easy to goof on them that over time, those differences, the ridiculousness of it will be highlighted by our culture to the point.

Speaker 3:          01:32:14       It will be common knowledge. Everybody will know that it's ridiculous to side with all women or decide with all men. Everyone will know that when two people get drunk and have sex together, if they're both consenting, they both fucked up and no one raped anybody. You know? There is a difference between rape and two people getting drunk where the man becomes a rapist and that's one of the big problems right now that's going on and this whole men's rights activist versus feminists culture argument that it's happened in at Occidental. It's happened in numerous cases where people have been blamed for things where two adults get together. They have consensual sex while they're both intoxicated, but the man becomes a rapist. That's fucking bullshit and it's always been bullshit. It's so strange because there's no, there's no other area where people are exempted from their bad decisions while they're drunk.

Speaker 3:          01:33:02       You know, if I get drunk and I get in my car and I crashed into a building or something, no one says, well you were drunk so you were impaired. So really the building attacked you or how about this? How about you assault someone, you get drunk at assault, someone you're responsible for your actions. 100 for sure. Yeah. It's all stupid, man. It's stupid and it's, it's based on if you hope, if you're a woman and you open your legs up while you're drunk and you, they add, bring it on, you know you're not responsible for that decision whatsoever. Well, I think that's the one decision where society societal be like, you know what? You were taken advantage of. You were raped. I think that doesn't exist in most aspects of society. It only exists in universities and amongst like super leftist, progressive liberals. That's the only way that they're trying to turn the all of society into that.

Speaker 3:          01:33:48       Yes, but it's being rejected is my point. It's like the fact that there's so much that's easy to criticize about it. It's so easy to reject and uni just sitting here when we just met today and we both goofing on it like we like we have a sketch, like we planned out a sketch. Was this the first time we've ever sat down and talked together and we're like bantering about this. Like we've rehearsed it. Like it's because it's so easy to mine. There's so much preposterous, stupid shit into it. It's so. I mean the, the, the stereotypes are so fucking obvious. He's like really feeble men who like defend these hideous women who have purple hair. Like what am I, is this, is this a fucking show on the WB from the early nineties? Like what is this? Remember the web, the Wayans brothers. Everyone remembers that. Come on. I think as it becomes more and more ridiculous, the more people will crack on it. Those, those ridiculous aspect, you know? I don't know. I don't have the same. I guess I don't have the same faith in people that you do because all what I see right now is that here are some ideas that I was subjected to these sjws social justice warrior, ultra feminist stuff. I've been arguing with us on the Internet for, I don't know, or six years

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       who said stop arguing with them. They're not going to change. I know, but. Well, I do it because people like to watch it. Like you said, it's easy to mind, but, but uh, I've seen them go from an obscure fringe of Internet people who have no power whatsoever to, you know, constantly having representatives on mainstream media. They've infiltrated the journalists on so many publications now. I know that right now America is kind of going through a, a disenfranchisement with the media in general anyway. But, uh, you know, it does seem like these, these people are permeating mainstream culture more and more. It doesn't seem to me like they're, you know, they're on the run or something. Well, you can put it this way, and I'm not sure if this is a valid comparison, but when you choose to engage them online, it's very similar to them being interviewed on CNN.

Speaker 1:          01:35:51       Whereas like it's fun, it's fun, or there's a point of view that's controversial. There's a hot a hot button that you can hit if you have someone who does something. Some guy does something and some woman goes on some television show and he argues that that man should be tried for rape because he had sex with intoxicated woman, let's say maybe a celebrity or a rockstar or athlete or something like that. If that became an issue, like you would immediately want to have one of those people on because one of those people is going to argue the very strong position that that guy is a rapist. Whereas then you would have some other men's rights guy on the other side or some other, you know, social, a libertarian type dude on the other side and they would. It would make for a great show and that's what people do.

Speaker 1:          01:36:35       And so in doing that, those movements grow and you find out who that person is, what their organization is, what's the Hashtag, find their twitter page, boom, like their facebook page, boom, you're in the circle. And by doing that, even you arguing with them online and them doing this on these one of these CNN type shows, it's the same kind of thing and a lot of ways because it's just, it's creating a portal where people who agree confine those, those other folks that also doesn't really seem like too many people will find them through me, agree with them. Some of the things I see. But that's comments and we've already established the comments or maybe one percent of the people watch if you watch, if you look at the metrics from the, the, the thumbs up and how many people subscribe when they see those videos on that stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:37:19       I'm sure there are people who find the videos and to discover some feminists through there, but I've never made a thumbs up in my life, made a comment in my life. Had Milo Yiannopoulos on the show a few weeks back. Uh, I don't know if you're aware, but he, he, he, his twitter has been unverified. We talked about it yesterday. It's insane. It's very strange because I cannot recall anyone's twitter ever becoming unverified, known plagiarists. There's no plagiarists that are verified, that have been proven as plagiarists. They're verified. And One guy who likes to poke fun and fuck with people and does it in a really humorous wally funny. I mean, what is his fucking twitter handle? Say the dangerous faggot. I think that's what he calls himself. Like it's in a giant label across the. Yeah, on the top is the dangerous faggot tour. And uh, his, his username is like at Nero Nero.

Speaker 1:          01:38:09       But the thing, the thing about it is, it's like, yeah, there you go. He's hilarious. He's a fun guy. We had him on our show, the show not too long ago. But, um, the thing is, the thing is, I mean, it Kinda just goes to the point I'm talking about have, you know, here's twitter, obviously taking sides. They don't do this to the people who are, um, who are feminists. They do this people who are critical of, well, here's the thing that's, that's part of his bread and butter as well with mining. That's that, uh, you know, my load doesn't have an egregious, like, isolated incident that they could point out. There's not one thing where you violated the terms of service with. They've alerted him on it. They just unverified them because they didn't cancel his account. No, they can't do anything. It's not doing anything wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:38:53       So what they're doing by attacking him, it's just making them stronger. It's so crazy. He got 20,000 new followers after they unverified him. Of course he did. And also there's a shit ton of people now impersonating him on twitter. Of course he's not, he's not verified so I can be Milo Yiannopoulos and so can I. and so can I, it's been like hit the reaction from the community, but it's been a disastrous, terrible decision for twitter. But it Kinda shows where twitter's head is at in this whole thing. And there's so many sites that are taking on these, these guidelines. Like if you actually read youtubes guidelines, like so many videos that I've made and that other youtubers like me have made like Sargon of cod. I don't know if you're familiar with him. Yes. A tenderfoot underfoot. Yeah. Like so many of our videos really, if if youtube just changed, not even the verbiage of the guidelines, but just their interpretation like those.

Speaker 1:          01:39:49       All of our channels could be gone easily. They can say all of this is wrong and sexist and vulgar and whatever guy in Canada going to jail for doing nothing more than a criticizing feminist online. I don't know if that's played out yet. A gag order. See, Canada has different laws. Surely this is how it's been explained to me and that this guy had already had an issue with these women and had a gag order to put on him. Then he violated the gag order by responding to their criticisms of him online. His point was like, you can't just talk about me on twitter and not have me respond. That's ridiculous. You're bullying me now, and so he went after them after they did that and then he gets arrested. Then he gets like legit legal trouble, so the question is should someone be able to have a gag order? And he apparently was working with them at one point in time, knew them first, then became a look. If you have a gag order, um, you know that, that doesn't give the people who put it against you the right to endlessly publicly humiliate you. I think you have the right to recourse. That was, she felt she had free shots at

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       him, so she started taking them and then he was responding to those. He's like, I couldn't defend myself and somehow or another in Canada that was worthy of an arrest. I don't know. I get messages all the time about Sweden too, about how things are going crazy in Sweden as a question though, in terms of like I've been, I've written several messages have been written to me about how it's, I don't know if it's, again, it's not against the law or anything, but it's very frowned upon for men to pee standing up anymore. Yeah. The should sit down like a bitch. Yeah. You got to sit down now.

Speaker 2:          01:41:27       Why is it so bad to sit down and pick? Like if I ever showed it at the same time, I have a fucking problem with it, but I like having the option of standing up if I fucking want to. Exactly. You know, I mean if it was like we suggest you sit down and here's some reasons why I'd be like, okay, these are worth considering. Thank you. But if it's like you should sit down because it's unfair to women who don't have a penis, it's like, well, is that what they're signing? Yeah. I. It's like, I didn't write the biology. What the fuck? Wait a minute. Someone's actually said that. Yes. That may be unfair to women who don't have a penis. That you can stand and pee. Yeah. It's like, oh, it's looked at as a male privilege. What about birth till we get pregnant as well.

Speaker 2:          01:42:04       Maybe we should put like Arnold 15 pound rock in our stomach. Junior. I know if you remember that. Yes. But he got pregnant. He actually got pregnant. But. So, you know, I would have liked that movie better if they showed the scene of the baby fucking coming out of his cock. You know, just like ripping it apart like a bloomin' onion. I think you got a c section. Yeah, probably. Yeah, I would assume. But they should have had that scene though. Schwarzenegger's sneakers, cock being destroyed by a fucking baby swing out of it. You don't have any faith that we're going to work through this really unfortunate moment in our culture. Oh No, I'm anything. It's possibility. Do you think if president trump gets an office, everything will be solved? Uh, you know, I think. I think he could solve some problems. Sure. What do he get solved?

Speaker 2:          01:42:50       I think he could do good. Some good things on infrastructure. I like his tufts stance on China. I wish that he would be. I wish instead of talking about a trade tariffs against China, he would actually talk about maybe getting China to cut off supply lines North Korea. Since you know, there's a country that actually poses a fucking grave, imminent threat that no one wants to do anything about. Yeah. There's no resources over there to jack because we can't poor people, but you know, it's like, here's a guy that's, you know, putting his own citizens in concentration camps whenever they questioned is already killing people. Here's a guy who was definitely working on various weapons programs, a hydrogen bomb. Well, I've heard some people be skeptical of that. I'm not sure. Well, you're online. Yeah. So there's always skeptics. But um, but yeah, I mean like what, what, whatever the case may be.

Speaker 2:          01:43:40       It's a dangerous fucking place. China is the only thing keeping them solvent because they're the ones that have the supply line. So if trump wants to have this big, tough stance on China, I don't understand why he doesn't come out and say we're going to fucking get China to stop feeding this fucking monster of North Korea. But uh, I do like that. He's tough on China in terms of like trade tariffs and shit. And I think that, uh, you know, in a lot of is a lot of his trade policy and like a lot of his aggressive stuff. I remember I was watching an interview with trump where he was saying, you know, Vladimir Putin will respect me and all this shit, and I was like, oh, shut up. Look, I will cut you open, you know? Then I was watching a Vladimir Putin talk and they asked him who he thought the strongest candidate was.

Speaker 2:          01:44:20       He's like, I like trump, you're strong. You know, so maybe Donald Trump was right when he was reading Vladimir Putin. Maybe that is the guy that Putin will respect. It's interesting. We're not sure that we should be looking for Putin's respect, but it's interesting when you go online and see the trump supporters, like, boy, it's more interesting to meet them in person. There's a lot of strange humans in that group. Yeah. Like finally a candidate who sees things the way I do. Personally, I was telling your they over there that, um, that I was at Disney world a few months ago because my mom is obsessed with Disney world. She always wants to go. She'd been 23 fucking times and I've been dragged a few times. But, uh, I met a trump supporter. They're your mom 10. No, she's a 50. But um, I met this trumps for their big fat woman stuck in a scooter cart. Right. And, uh, like, um, she's like, I was like, uh, she's talking about trump and she's like, I hate Mexicans across the street from me. They are all illegal and loud now on day nathen while now one do nothing about it. That's why we got to get trump in there. I don't know what we going to do if we don't get trumped. Almost crying. Wow. Like emotional impassioned. Like she wants fucking trump and she wants him now.

Speaker 3:          01:45:37       Hmm. And he's going to fix everything. Yeah, he's gonna fix everything. It's going to be beautiful. No one's ever fixed everything. No one has ever gotten office and fucking shit got way better. But the reality of the presidency, if you look at Obama's presidency, um, as far as accomplishments, it's very confusing. It's very confusing when you look at the, uh, the, the data as far as, um, the economy because many people think that he's done an incredible job of building up the economy and, and making the economy come back. And like, so I don't know because other people say that the economy came back on a cycle and that it was on a downward trend and when the crash of 2008 happened, there's automatically like a rebounding and that's what happens. Things go bad and then they get better and there's been shifts.

Speaker 2:          01:46:26       The economy got a lot better for a Wall Street. It didn't really get too much better for normal people.

Speaker 3:          01:46:34       But when you limit the statistics, I went up a little bit. Yeah, that's what I'm saying though is a tick. But there's still huge unemployment problem. Right? Well isn't it also the see the unemployment things confusing to me too because I think what also happens with unemployment is if you're not looking for a job anymore, it's not counted as unemployed.

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       Yeah. So the people who gave up, they don't count them, but there's a lot of them. They said there's a lot of people now that are quote unquote retiring in their twenties and stuff like they just given up on work. They're like, Eh, fuck the world. How do you eat? You just leach, just Leech off other people. Well, there's gotta be a lot of that. That's a, that's a constant in society. You're always gonna have people that are lazy and unmotivated. That's just always going to exist and people will demonize those people and try to say that all poor people or that. And that's not necessarily true. That's not true at all. I know some really hard working people who were very poor. Yeah, and it's also like, excuse me, circumstances which you were born where you live, the environment and where you find yourself stuck as a small person with parents that you didn't ask for in a city that you didn't pick and you're like, well fuck, you know, and the idea that that person's the same person as someone who's born in Beverly Hills to fucking really wonderful parents who bring them to a nice private school.

Speaker 1:          01:47:46       It's, it's crazy. But this is, you know what you're saying right now. That's another one of these things people like to rebel against. They don't like, they don't like the reality of like maybe we all have different circumstances and different hurdles to overcome. They don't want to hear anything like that. Yeah, they just want to hear that America is the fucking dream that, you know, anybody can be a success here. Any, any child born can be president one day or something. I mean it's, you know, it's just not realistic. Well, if the child wants to suck Satan's Dick and make its way through the labyrinth to the center of the heart of darkness, yeah, every child can be president, but I don't have to go through the whole song, believe in Satan. Whereas Satan's Dick is real. Dude. You seen it. Bill Hicks had a joke about it.

Speaker 1:          01:48:25       I know it's real effects. He would do. Yeah, Satan's cock. I saw him do that live couple times. Oh Wow. Awesome. He had a really long Harlan once live. I never saw a bill Hicks live. I saw Hicks alive a few times, maybe three or four, I think four times. That's awesome. Yeah, it's a lot of fun. I saw him before anyone knew who he was. Interesting. I saw him when he had just done one of those Hbo Young Comedian Specials and a note like very few people knew who he was, like maybe a few people that knew that he had been on hbo, like if you, if you were on the marquee. Oh, been on HBO. Oh, all right. But it's seven minutes on HBO. It's just a bunch of funny gags and bits. But then when you see them live, you got to see this full attack on culture or life in general and the mall mentality and Jimi Hendrix, uh, like it was some, some betty did about Jimi Hendrix meeting tiffany at the mall and it was awesome. It was awesome because I didn't expect it. The first time I saw him I was like, wow, this guy's crazy. Like this is, this is completely a different kind of comedy. Yeah. I was, uh, he was already dead by the time I became a fan of unfortunate man. But, uh, I just know one of his ex girlfriends, she was like, I think she was his girlfriend, like right before he passed too. It was weird. She was

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       a comic too and she was just bewildered by it. She just kind of went into a shell, you know, when she was like this link to me, like I knew her, like she was like the link to like one of the late great ones. Like, Oh, you knew him. He actually fuck back. I'm cool. You know, it was weird to uh, to know someone who is intimate with like one of the all time greats as the power of his dick still reside within you. Do you know? So it, it was also weird too that he was so young, like he died of cancer. I think he was 33 or 34 years old. Yeah. It was really young and so much work done by that time and so much of an impact on the people that saw it. Like he, there was a possibility that he could've gone to shit if he'd still been around because like what, what is it, you know, it, it's, it's a thing with like it happens with comedians that happens with musicians.

Speaker 3:          01:50:37       It happens with movie directors happens with just artists in general of like all their good shit is really early on and then it just seems like it goes downhill. Is that just like a matter of public perception or do you think there's something that like changes in the mentality or it's depends on the individual and what they work at. But a good example is David Bowie. David Bowie kept producing to the very end. I mean he just really wants to grab them. It was great. Yeah. So I think it's, what are your motivations like what's motivating you to produce things so you, you just trying to fill up a hole that was left by having an asshole stepmother who you know, fucking screamed at you and kicked you out of the house when you're 17. Is that what it is? Or a zero, like a legit desire to create and have you cultivated that legit desire to create?

Speaker 3:          01:51:21       I think some artists continued to be really good throughout their lives and then some artists, they hit this wall somewhere and that it's a wall sort of seems to coincide. Superstardom like I think there's stardom and then their superstardom and I think superstardom is almost impossible to ask someone to navigate whether it's Michael Jackson level of fame or fucking axl rose or whatever. I think there's a level where everybody's just like your brain just get fucking scrabbled. Like, dude, I could take it. Like if you ever, um, have you ever been in a fighter jet blue angels type situation now they, um, they roller coasters. I don't, I don't fuck around with like g forces shit. Well, and a lot of ways it's kind of similar in some ways, but way more extreme obviously in someone else's piloting it. But I'm just saying like, I can't even handle the little kitty pussy version of that.

Speaker 3:          01:52:10       So there's no way there's, there's amount of g force that you can take and it's. Everybody has a number and it gets to like six, seven, eight, nine, 10. And the guys who are like the heavy duty hardcore blue angel dudes can get into like the 11th and twelfth and they just stay conscious through this insane pressure. So they're banking. He take these hard turns. The g forces is overwhelming because you have a jet engine and a plane that weighs nothing and it's just flying through the canyons and you're black out like you feel your consciousness closing like an elevator door and some people can take a lot of it and some people can't and it's a matter of like how strong you are, how used to it. You are how accustomed you get to the experience, how much you practice resisting it because you have to hook, you have to hook, you have to do little stuff where you're forcing blood into your brain, but it's saint called hooking, but I think that's a lot like that sort of Michael Jackson superstar them level.

Speaker 3:          01:53:06       Yeah. I think it just like the pressure becomes so fucking overwhelming that only a few people can hang in there. Most people just elvis out just fucking blackout and pills and chaos and shredding to the wheat field and gas fires. At least. Elvis had an entertaining end though. Cold. A little trap. Yeah. He, um, he went out, you know, they, they, they remastered one of his concerts, his last concert in Vegas. They're showing it in movie theaters now. Really? Yeah. There was an ad for when I went to see star wars. It's fucking crazy, man. It's wild to see like it's like a time capsule of Elvis on stage and he's kind of overweight and he's sweaty and shit and all these people going nutty for him. It's like, wow, this was a. This was not that long. You ever hear of extreme elvis? Yes. I know him.

Speaker 3:          01:53:51       You know him? A little blog post about him in like 2002. He doesn't do it anymore. I know. You've gotten too much trouble, right? It's a feminist. No, really. That's crazy. Told me he's a male feminist. Wow. I'm one of the argument with me about it and debate then. Good luck. We're not interested in seeing how much things weigh. Doesn't do that anymore either. I don't think. Uh, but I mean everything that, that was good about them is gone. We used to get hammered and he used to be on stage and just get blast. I'm like, so wait. It's like Elvis and Gigi Allen combined into one. That sounds pretty awesome. It was pretty awesome. Well, here's the thing, he's actually very talented as a musician and so we're the band members like the music was fucking good. He sounded like fucking Elvis. Yeah, like spot on and there's a girl that would sing with them who was hot and she would take her top off and he would piss in her mouth and it's like this micro penis and he pulls out.

Speaker 3:          01:54:43       I mean it's a micro penis and he's pissing in her mouth on stage because like, who wants to drink the kinds pissed. She's like, I do, I do. She's got her tits out. The club's going crazy. They can't like, they're going to get fired, right? Or everyone's going to get a. they're going to get evicted and closed down. So he's pissing in her mouth on stage and the club owner comes up. There was at one point in time, he walked out into the audience and some girl just started shoving a bottle up his ass like a beer bottle. So he starts backing up into the bottle and then she panics and, and just gets out of there. I don't remember. She would drop the ball a what? But when he tried, he's like, that's the wrong holt's order. We were hunting. He like tried to help her stick this beer bottle in his ass and that's what she was like, alright, you when you, when you took it too far, they weren't willing to go to the same extremes as extreme elvis, but he was not getting paid for these gigs because he was getting kicked out and they would, they would kick them out of there and he would wonder why.

Speaker 3:          01:55:32       Strange. Well me and Stan Hope, um, we're, we're both there alive. When it was, it was like before we did the mantra was like, so it had to be like 2002 and he was doing it back then. It was really good, man. It was a good fucking show. Like he was a really good singer and he had great musicians and the girl could sing her ass off, like try replacing her. A girl who can sing her ass off and she lets you piss in her mouth onstage because that's like the whole thing is that like everything about the act is like, you know, but the thing can't even conceive of it. He's got his pants off. Okay. He's just pissed in her mouth. The fucking crowd is in chaos and he sang suspicious minds and they're singing along. Singing all caught in a trap. Did it.

Speaker 3:          01:56:16       There's a little. Dick is out. He's fat. She's a girl. The girls next to them saying she's got piss on her fucking tits. He pissed her mouth where you can't go on together. It was fucking amazing. It was one of the best. It was on the best show in my life. I wish I could have seen some of that shit. I need to be a club owner. If I was a club owner. I totally understand. I'll be like, I see what you're doing there, man. That was great. You just went for it. You could have just made him like the House Act. I connected him to Penn Jillette and he performed a pendulum. That's where I heard about him. I heard about him for Pendula. Oh, okay. Well I connected him with Penn. Penn read my blog and penn contacted me. He's like, this guy real.

Speaker 3:          01:56:52       I'm like, she's amazing. Because Penn came on fear factor. Penn and teller will bolt on fear factor and I became friends with pen and uh, and then he hired him, but he made sure he was so he wanted him to be sober because penn is. Penn is no drugs, no alcohol, no nothing. He just like, he has parties on his house and he won't let anybody do anything. You have to go there and you have to be totally straight, which I don't know, he's an entertaining guy. I mean, as long as you're around, dude, I'll stay sober if you promise. Don't go anywhere if you to stay being a stay being interesting. But um, I don't think he doesn't anymore. I think he's, uh, he's out of the business now as far as extreme elvis. Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know. He was as aware.

Speaker 3:          01:57:31       He'd been gone for awhile, but I didn't know the full story like you. I, I can, I can say that elvis picture behind you keep just like drawing my eye, you know, I'll start focusing on that and then you'll become blurry and I'd be like, oh shit. He was one of the few guys that was a white guy that could rock sunglasses indoors. Look at that picture. I mean, this fucking dude. Is tHat the white house? Okay. He's got a fake mug shot that's taken out the white house and he's got his sunglasses on. He was a bad motherfucker. I agree, but again, too much g-force. He spiraled out, hit the rocks, died young. They all do. It's just too much. I think it's too much. I think there's a reason why miley cyrus is sticking her tongue out and going fucking bananas. She's trying to stay above water. That bitches just being overwhelmed. And I think that's what happens to all of them. It's just too much fame, you know? And I think that's why a lot of artists go to shit. That's what I think. I think the fame overwhelms the creativity and that becomes almost a primary focus of your life is mitigating the effects of fame versus just experiencing life. I think for artists especially whether you're a comic

Speaker 5:          01:58:42       or whether you're a musician or a writer, I think you have to experience life. You have to go out and do things by, with this set idea in mind of enjoying the moment and having life experiences or being in the moment and not constantly worrying about the business or ticket sales or concert dates. I've

Speaker 2:          01:59:03       always surrounded myself with people who are more pragmatic than myself so they can worry about that shit because, you know, it's good to. I can't really conduct myself in that way. I can't be concerned about like how many views in the last video get, how much money am I making this month? You know? Uh, so especially if you start considering in your creative process, right. Because I can't do that, you know, I have to keep it separate. So that's why I kinda like, I kind of leach off of the responsibility of other people because I can't really be responsible myself. I have to be very, like sort of a flighty and chaotic and always just off doing my own thing. Like every once in a while my friend ben, we'll just look at me and be like, jesus christ, are you a fucking cartoon character? Because I'll just do weird shit that I guess doesn't seem reasonable to him in some way.

Speaker 2:          01:59:52       Like I just conduct myself in a strange how fashion. Like I'll the other day where we like to get to la, right? We were supposed to leave at 7:20 because we got a flight that's leaving an 8:45. I'm there, uh, you know, bike, my friends ben and scotty who came with me. Uh, scotty's my brother ben is my friend and cohost. They're both actually cohost on my drunken peasants podcast. Doesn't matter because it on itunes by the way. Yeah. And um, they, they come there. They're both ready at seven slash 20. Of course I'm not ready. You know, I'm still fiddle fucking around. I'm barely fucking getting dressed at seven, 20 7:40. I come upstairs, you know? Uh, it's like disaster after disaster. The garage door fucks up, it won't close. We gotta fucking manually close it. We get to the airport. We were trying to drive the airport.

Speaker 2:          02:00:44       There's a traffic jam. We got to change routes. We get to the ticket machine. The ticket machine says we can't check in because we're too late, but we already fucking checked in. So we just needed to fucking print our boarding passes. All kinds of stupid shit happen. So my friend ben, he's like the kind of guy that gets really stressed about shit, like hyperventilating, like when things go wrong and the more shit goes wrong, the more he's panicking. Right. And so he's really panicked. He's in this fucking really agitated state. We're going through security, he's running to the fucking plane because he knows like this motherfucker we're supposed to have taken off like 10 minutes ago. It's going to be a miracle if he gets there. So he's running the onto the plane and he gets on and uh, you know, then scottie gets on and finally, like I guess at the last possible moment before they're leaving the gate, I show up and I get on the plane and I sit down and I didn't realize it at the time. But ben, scotty, we're both

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       like staring daggers at me. Like this is all your fucking fault. You horriBle, irresponsible piece of shit. So you cartoon because you're late? No, no. And then I fucking stick my leg, you know, staring daggers. Me, they're Pissed. But I'm like totally oblivious to it. I'm just like, um, oh, let's see. Has pretty good leg room for a plane and they'll, they're just like fuck it. Burst out laughing at me and shit. Cause it's just like I'm, I don't make the connection between like what other people think is supposed to be serious. What other people think is supposed to be going on. I'm just going to do my own thing all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:02:18       So you're late. Yeah. It was like, in other words, I was late. You were late. I was late and I didn't give a fuck. You're irresponsible. a little bit. I got it. It sounds like a comedian. I'm lazy. I'm lazy. I'm irresponsible. I fuck with you saying it like it's almost like a badge of courage. Like you like it. Yeah, sure. I like being the way I am, but I'm just saying that I have them around to be like these nagging bitches to kind of be my handlers. Cattle Prod me into fucking actually doing an associate because you know, left to my own devices. Could I have gotten on a plane and come to la and been on the joe rogan podcast? Probably not. I don't think so now. That's sad. I had to just been like, feel like you could make it if your life depended on it.

Speaker 1:          02:02:58       Maybe just not tell you if you're standing on it, but you know, I'd probably just sit there and be like, you know, do I want to be on joe rogan? Yeah. Do I want to travel across the country now? I'd rather sit here and watch netflix. Well, we've always threatened to do shows on skype, but it's just, it's no, no, you don't think you should, you know, you got this whole like face to face, like in person thing going on, you lose something with the skype thing. I think so too. But there's a few people that you can't get, like kim.com. I'd like to get him because he's in. You can't leave New Zealand or maybe just make exceptions for people like, yeah, I want to do him because I want to do him, you know, him doing show. Um, I feel like he's really getting a raw deal in a real weird deal the way a lot of people have asked me to describe your height.

Speaker 1:          02:03:42       Five. Eight, five, eight? Yes. Okay. Describe it. Well, no, because we found all this. We found contradictory information. We can unconsciously roommates or some shit. You said you were like five, six some shit. Said you were five, nine, five, eight, five eight. Right in the middle. Five eight. I'm kim dotcom to giant guy. he's huge. He's like this cushion for the pushing. Fascinating dude. Man. A key. Um, it all. If you don't know his story, it all came from, but people that are listening to came from mega upload. he had one of those upload sites, but they don't, they don't really have those anymore, do they? Um, I think there's still some version of mega upload around, but it's not at the same url or anything, but used to be that like you were, I could upload something under an account, like you could upload a movie and I could download it from your account so you could take a pirated record, sharp load online.

Speaker 1:          02:04:31       And so they made him responsible for all this stuff that people uploaded. He did. He invented that, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He didn't invent shit. I mean, there was plenty, there was plenty of services doing it. Google had their own version of services that we're doing it for some reason. This guy was the problem. Yeah. Why was that? Why did he get in trouble? Because he flaunted it. Is that what it was? Yeah. I mean he flaunted it and he changed his name to [inaudible] dot com. He made a spectacle of himself. Yeah. He used to be called like kimball or something like that and he used to have. We did this before, remember jamie, we played some of his old animations. You remember that it was kimbo or it might've been kimbo. He was calling himself before kimbo slice kimbo or kimber or kimba, I forget what it was, but he had this website way back in the day when he was just like a really resourceful hacker and he had like a flash, like a suPer complex flash animated opening to his website like way back in the day and he was way, way, way ahead of the curve and he made these like really funny little animated things of him being in his mega car going to his mega boat.

Speaker 1:          02:05:36       You remember all that kimball? That's what it was. It does before he called himself kim.com. Yeah. But I mean like, you know, it's kind of easy to see why he gets singled out. I mean if you got, you know, I don't know, 10 drug dealers and most of them are really low key, but one guy's out there like, I'm the fucking drug king Pin bitch, you know, who the fuck you is going to attract the attention. Of course. Yeah. no, I mean it makes sense I guess. And also he didn't have the benefit of being attached to a giant company like google or one of the other file sharing companies and he probably wouldn't provide the information that they would provide about the people that are uploading things because I would imagine someone like google or someone like if you upload something illegal, they probably made.

Speaker 1:          02:06:18       They probably make it pretty transparent thing. Gonna take your side over the government's now. Sorry dude, we got. We're here to make money. You tripped us up. So I wonder what's going to happen with him because they took all his money, right? I mean know what his current situation is. I try to move them kind like a uh, I don't know. They're trying to fly him to America. It's been like, it's been two years since I heard anything about that case. I just don't know. Yeah, I'm vice went and interviewed him fairly recently, like I want to say within the last year. And I didn't see that he's got a remarkably upbeat attitude about all this, but you know, it's essentially one guy and whatever organization he has left versus United States government, the new New Zealand governments complying, they gave up all his money and the whole thing's kinda kinda reminds me of larry flynt and away. Hmm. Flint seem like more of a victim because there was no one who is being stolen from. There was no lost revenue by him showing, you know, but it was still someone who was, you know, agitating the, you know, not necessarily morality in the case of kim dotcom but agitating, you know, the law abiding sector or whatever. And you know, he was kinda like, they both got shit on and made a victim of and just like almost was like a

Speaker 2:          02:07:35       one man show down against the entire government and both of those situations and. But yeah, movie star at a courtney love. Yeah. I think larry flynt was, uh, was probably a more of a victim though. You're probably right about that. Yeah. It doesn't seem like there's any arguments good in that she was playing a heroin junkie. So vain and it's probably not. Did you see the church? No, I haven't seen it yet.

Speaker 3:          02:07:57       I saw the other night. Whoa. What is it? Is it, is it like a conspiracy thing? Ah, it's the conspiracy where they believed that, uh, courtney love had kurt cobain killed or was involved somehow or another in his murder and that she had. There's evidence. They believe that she forged his, uh, his death letter, her know I've heard the suicide note forging thing when you listen to like the recordings that he, uh, the private investigator has with her and you get a glimpse into her mindset. You're like, ooh. Like they fucked up either whether she was innocent or not. They absolutely fucked up the burden investigation. The murder investigation was, or the, excuse me, the death investigation, suicide investigation. They fucked it up. Like they ruled it a suicide before the coroner did. Like there was, there was so much of it that varied from the first responder, like his version of the scene versus the, uh, the police department's version of the scene. Like what, when they compare, compare the two stories. The whole thing is it's definitely a cluster. Fucking sheriff wound up getting fired for some other in competence or fuckery. It's, it's a very disturbing. It's very disturbing documentary.

Speaker 2:          02:09:04       But who knows how many cases the same department had botched before they just had this high profile one to botch. Sure. I mean, how many people are sitting in prisons right now that don't deserve to be there? Probably tonight.

Speaker 3:          02:09:15       Oh, a lot. Yeah, a lot. Yeah, no doubt about it, man. Well, that's what this making a murderer. The other netflix thing is about. Yeah, they're, they're trying to show you how fucking chaotic and criminal some police departments really are. I mean, how, what kind of nutty shit really does go down and some of these small town police department.

Speaker 2:          02:09:34       I was reading about a, uh, a case. This isn't something back from the seventies, but uh, there was um, these janitors. There was like five janitors at this high school. I'm, this white girl's body was found, uh, raped and murdered in the attic of the school and the sheriff, you know, walked into the room with the five janitors and four of them are white and one of them is black. She, he's like, you know, someone's going to have to hang for this and urine nigger. So I'm afraid it's going to have to be you. So I mean, that's like the attitude. Um, jesus christ. Pretty brazen. This was Texas, I believe. So what year was this? Seventies. God. Well, again, what we're talking about, if you know, if you want to, if I'm mistaking any details of it, the whole thing can be found in this video I did called like the top 10, a false rape accusations or something like that because was, it was basically all these people who have gone to jail for rape allegations that later turned out to be false or there's got to be hundreds and thousands.

Speaker 2:          02:10:41       Tons, tons, tons. It's terrifying. The idea that people get locked up and even executed for somethIng that they had no part in. It's terrifying. It's amazing how, I mean, uh, dna evidence. I'm in my own state of Louisiana. I don't know. Everyone know what came of this, you own Louisiana. I did back then sarah. It's my own state. Just like you own him. I only Louisiana. Um, no, but uh, in, in when I was living in Louisiana at the time I was watching some local news shit and um, they, they wanted to do dna evidence to. There was a guy who was a in there for rape and murder and he said, I want a dna test done to prove my innocence and you know, the da got on and said, well we can't do that dna test because if we do it and it turns out he is innocent, we look bad.

Speaker 2:          02:11:30       Like that's literally like the, the, that's not the subutex. That's not like, well, you know, we better come up with some bullshit reason. [inaudible] will look bad if this happens. No, his overt reason for not doing the dna test is maybe you know, we might actually exonerate this guy and make ourselves look like idiots who just punished him for years. Uselessly, oh, you're callousness now towards thIs situation isn't exactly helping matters. Is it? It's terrifying. I don't know how that turned out though, but you know, you see that shit all the time. I, the justice system is fucked. It's fucked up. Well, people having too much is fucked. People having the power to decide who's guilty and who's innocent based on withholding information or, or releasing it. Sensibility. I don't know. It's a really good question. But in that situation, it's not a good system. It's a terrible system.

Speaker 2:          02:12:17       If they could withhold evidence and not be god damn it. What a dark thing that has to do to know someone who's innocent and send him to die in a fucking cement sell because you don't want to get caught fucking up or you didn't want to. It's so terrifying. They want to have the case. They wanna be able to say, case closed, you know? Well, it's like a. Who was it? Uh, was it ed gain? No, it wasn't at gain. Uh, there was some serial killer that maybe you'll know who I'm talking about when they found out that he was going around. Really? Lucas? Yeah. They found out he was going around killing people and shit and they decided, you know, we got all these unsolved murders on the books and we could just pIn them on him. They had him like a confessed to the murders, like as if he did like a murderer in, like, you know, san francisco one day, and then like New York city five hours later and shit, just any murder case around the country that was closed, that was passkey to them. They just say, oh yeah, it was, it was Henry Lee lucas. He'd done it and he would go to the scene and he'd, they feed him information and then he'd feed the same information back to them and he got to be like celebrity serial killer. Created a mythology behind them that led to a movie henry portrait of a serial killer. Yeah. Yeah. Which was the guy from the walking dead. The brother that got his hand caught off and the walking dead. Oh really? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       What the fuck is his name? Really good dude. He's using merle great actor. I don't know they not the crossbow guy, but his brother is one of the interesting. I don't remember the name of the. I forget the guy's name, but he's an michael rooker. Yes. Awesome actor. He was Henry Lee lucas. Henry lucas was this terrifying, violent, ruthless vicious man on the real headline. Really? Lucas was this little shifty shufly fucking hustler character who's just really fucked up and lost and they made him out to be. This mom killed maybe like three or four people maybe. Who knows? I mean, well, he killed his mother for sure. I believe. Maybe. I Don't know. I'm not positive. I'm not one of these people that's obsessed with serial killers and shit, but that's just another example of like law enforcement gone crazy. There is in the movie fellow was a really good movie though.

Speaker 1:          02:14:20       It's a. It's an interesting movie. It's, I'm in a lot of ways it reminded me of that fucked up movie where brad pitt played was a California where brad pitt played a. I'm a serial killer. So with California, with a k? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That was a, it was a dark movie. It was fun because they didn't go with the usual, like super genius serial killer either. They made him kind of like, you know, just a simple guy. Yeah. Which is probably more likely. Yeah. I mean, I guess they say that serial killers have above average iq was. But the hannibal lecter archetype is not really accurate. Did you see that fucking thing where they showed that more money has been taken from americans from the police then from burglars in 2015? It doesn't surprise me. There's plenty of laws. There's plenty of laws that say you can, you know, uh, I don't know what the amount is or how many states allow this, but basically they can just sees any amount of money up to a certain amount or more than $1,000 or something.

Speaker 1:          02:15:19       He just say, well, oh, this is oBviously drug money received for evidence and you know, you could be on your way to buy a car. You, you know, you've got a craigslist ad guy selling a car. Okay, I'm on my way over. You bring cash. Okay. I'll go to the back when I was a kid, my dad was rIch and he would carry like $15,000 around in his wallet ball and big money, you know, did he have like crazy shoes and like a lot of times he was like stupid looking silk shirts and shit. He looked like some kind of decadent roman emperor and he always had big orgies at his house to dad is cool. He was cool. What did he do for a living? He was pretty much a con man. Whoa. Really? Where uh, he started as a diploma mill called lasalle university. Did you? Shit, I don't believe you, but. No, no, he just started. He started a fake university degree mill, you know, it kind of, you could say in some ways maybe it was fake or maybe it was just a precursor to things like phoenix, university of phoenix that just, you know, but his real problem

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       wasn't the school. It was the government never went after him and said, you're running a scam school. The government went after him for, for committing mail fraud and for um, a tax evasion was the big one because he didn't feel like he had to pay any taxes they felt otherwise. So he ended up in jail for, um, you know, three or four years over that will actually was sentenced to five years, but then he claims to be a drug addict even though he wasn't, never did drugs and they gave him some time off his sentence for enrolling in a drug treatment program. God, that's awesome. He was always lookIng for the angles. I wish I had that ability like my dad did. Is he still around? Now? He's dead. Uh. Is your mom still around? Yes. When you talked to your mom about him, like, like how long were they together?

Speaker 2:          02:17:13       Uh, you know, I think about maybe eight or nine years. Wow. What a, what a blessed be like to be a woman and to have a child with a crazy man who's running around just scamming people and hustling. You know what I mean? It wasn't like he was really scamming people. He was actually helping people to scam employers. If they know the degree is fucking bogus. Right. That's a good point. And actually it was crazy because when it was exposed, there was like congressman and you know, they got their degree, like ceos of major companies that all had degrees from lasalle university. Super successful even with fake degrees. Yeah. That's hilarious. Well, you know what, degrees are bullshit anyway. Well, they certainly are not the only limiting factor in someone's competency. Yeah. I mean, especially not for like business or something science. Maybe that's a different story.

Speaker 2:          02:18:06       I'll for sure. Medicine. Yeah. You want a real document? We don't want, you know, a doctor with a lasalle medical degree with an incomplete idea and I don't think, I don't think he, uh, he, he issued medical degrees though. Well, either way, that's not the most egregious example of someone being a con person. That's not. No, I mean, uh, there's probably way worse things, but you know what I mean. Yeah. But he was an interesting guy though and actually, you know, when he was dying, when he was on his death, he died of a super massive heart attack at the age of 61, you know, basically I was sitting there at my desk, uh, working for him on whatever he was doing and my step mom comes and she taps me on the shoulder and she's like, something is seriously wrong with your father. And I follow her and he's sitting there on the bed and he's just like a, I'm like a dad, are you okay?

Speaker 2:          02:18:57       I'm like, oh shit. We called nine slash 11, uh, took him to the hospital, that stuff. And that was reallY the moment when he's lying there in the hospital bed and everyone's saying, you know, he's fucked and you know, this, there's not, you know, his, his wife is kind of align yourself and saying like, we'll be laughing about this tomorrow, but not really believe in it. And shit. Well she knew she was in the will, but there was no will. Oh, unfortunatelY. But anyway, that was probably the only time in at least my adult life that I ever prayed or anything like that because I did, you know, even as a staunch atheIst and a strong skeptic, you know, I was emotionally moved enough at that time to prostrate myself before I or power and say, you know, if there is something out there, you know, could you change this outcome?

Speaker 2:          02:19:48       Didn't happen. Um, maybe you didn't pray Hard enough or you didn't really believe I didn't really see people right now that are mad at you. I didn't pray hard. And if you say that, but we'll think about what you just said. How many people right now are going to be mad at you for that? You call yourself the amazing atheist because god took your dad. No, I was calling myself tHe amazing atheist before that I know, but can imagine being the amazing atheist and then in when, when the test comes from a where I failed the test. Luckily, luckily atheism doesn't have any built in tests or anything like that. It does. Now I just. What do you think about atheism plus is that you are, okay, well, if you're going to define sjw to people, you've got to define atheism plus to people because if they don't know sjw, they certainly don't know atheism.

Speaker 2:          02:20:27       Plus atheism plus is a very weird little offset group of atheists who want to connect atheism with a bunch of moral and ethical beliefs. So in other words, it's a cult. Yeah. And uh, you know, it's mostly a, it's mostly just due to feminist infiltration, but If you look at what they've done to the speaking circuit, the atheist speaking straight like this used to be like hot shit that attracted thousands of people. They wanted to see christopher hitchens. They want to see richard dawkins, they wanted to see sam harris. They want to see daniel dennett. They want to see all these like big towering intellectuals deliver this fucking iconic classic message and an entertaining and compelling passionate way. And now you look at the conferences and it's fucking, I am a cis gendered white male and I recognize that as such. I have a lot of privilege here on this panel.

Speaker 2:          02:21:26       It's gone from fucking christopher hitchens to that. And as a result, attendance has dwindled. It's shit. These people still have something of an online presence, mostly spearheaded by a guy named um, pz myers a hates my guts. Hates everybody. Really. Um, there's a lot of hate coming from that dude. yeah. He's a very hateful fuck and you know, I don't have no problem with them. Look, if you want to have atheism plus and you want to be like, we're atheism plus all this other shit, fine by me, have fun, but you know, you don't get to come to me and be like, you're already to be atheism. Plus thIs idea of shaming people into changing or shaming people that somehow or another you're writing. Well, that's how you become a warrIor, right? You have to go out and attack. You have to shame people for their differing viewpoints or sexist opinions like big on sexism.

Speaker 2:          02:22:18       Very. That's like one of the number one, uh, attacks they'll uh, they'll use Is going after sexists like and shaming them, shaming them in some way, hurting them, lashing out, making them feel that pain. And it seems like a way of bullying in response to the bullying that they've experienced, like dave experience, negativity. so they've decided to turn that negativity on people they feel deserve it. You know, I noticed uses that bullying, that uh, that shaming tactic to milo bEcause, you know, he, he, you know, he pulled this, he pulled something on your show where he did this thing, this little bit where he's like, you and him got in an argument maybe about circumcision or something like that. And he's like, I can't believe you of all people would argue with me on, you know, and he tried that same shit on our show.

Speaker 2:          02:23:04       So he has this weird thing where like, eh, it's, it's a really interesting rhetorical trick because not only does it shame you for not apparently being as extreme on the issue as he is, but it also bolsters itself is like, look, joe rogan doesn't even have the balls to say what I milo yiannopoulos. Say the drunken peasants podcast doesn't have the balls to say what I milo yiannopoulos saying because I think it's just a clever debating tactic. It's just he's, he's trying to win and these guys, when he's having fun, it's effective, but you know, that's why I got to call that shit because, you know, we can't let them get away with it forever. I see what you're saying. If you only looked at him as being a rational debate or I look at him as being a theater. He's what he is. His problem is that, you know, on when he was on our show, you know, we had our, one of our guys, paul, very popular, I got a guy on our show, uh, you know, attacking his arguments, treat them like you would treat any other guests, but you know, the milo fanboys or like how dare you challenge the perfect walk, kick of by.

Speaker 2:          02:24:09       Whoa. It's like he doesn't have perfect lodge. I think he's a smart guy. He's an entertaining guy. He's compelling, but eh, he's not completely 100 percent objective dicks. So didn't know anybody is circumcision and he hates his own sexuality too. Well, I don't know how much that's real. I think it's real sincere. It, it's hard to know when you delve into religion with him too. I don't know if you guys got into that very much. It's pretty ridiculous, but I think that's. I think that's connected though. I think you know the hustle. No, I think he's sincere. I think it's a hustle. It's a hustle. I want to be conservative. You want to be respected and conservative. Circles need to be down with the baby jesus. You have to. That's almost the only point of entry that's undeniable. You cannot be an atheist. I got a staunch atheist advocate for atheism, plus being a republican. They're not gonna let you in, but you could be a gay guy. He could be flamboyantly gay as long as you have a sense of humor, batteries, fan, and as long as you have plenty of self loathing and wish you weren't and then we'll let you in. Well, you know what we believe in jesus. One thing that kinda does go to what you're saying is that when he on our show, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:25:25       he specIfically told us like let's try not to talk about religion too much and when he did talk about religion and he was very, it was easily the most evasive subjects, so maybe maybe you're onto something there. He didn't want to get into it too much with me either. I think he would go to this whole thing that judeo christian values or what this country is founded upon and judeo christian centered countries are the best countries. Like he had these talking points that he did not want to debate or explore other than repeat those premises and I felt like there's a certain amount of him that I just, I just give in to the fact that a lot of his theater and I think he's entertaining. It's almost like his brand of gonzo journalism. She's bran of gonzo. Journalism is sort of this gay self-loathing jesus believer.

Speaker 3:          02:26:10       Like he'll put stuff on twitter like a, like something about people believing in god. The only smart people. Like that's it. Like the whole sentence and people. Yes, yes, the fucking apes to start fucking banging against the cage and appreciation and I imagined that he's laughing while this is all going on. I can't imagine that a guy who's as rational as he is fact based and driven as his arguments are about so many different things when it comes to arguing against social justice warriors or whatever the fuck it is, but it against religion. He has this giant blind spot and there's the religion in question that he chooses. Thinks that he's an abomination, like it's preposterous. I think intellectually you could make the argument that it's not theater. I believe he's theater. I think he's the dangerous faggot tour. He's havIng a fun time with this whole thing.

Speaker 3:          02:27:00       It's the whole thing is awesome. I think it's awesome that the twitter unverified have to. They just fucking created a bigger monster. They just threw gasoline on a fire. They fucked up. Why? Why do you think they don't see shit like that though? Because they're assholes. Just say they're too. They're too blinded by what assholes. They are to realize that all they're going to do is add to his popularity and legend. They must the people that made that decision must harbor social justice warrior ideals. There is no question about it. The other. There's no way other than that that you could look at what he's doing and and say that this is a guy that you should unverified. I mean, yOu have to do something to get banned, right? If do something mean you have to harass someone. You Have to call someone problems. well, someone can block you, so if you're bugging them, they can block you and then theoretically at least you're not experiencing their, their bullshit anymore unless they start new accounts.

Speaker 3:          02:27:49       So they didn't, they didn't ban him. They just unverified him. Well, that doesn't make any fucking sense because you know exactly who he is. Verification it's supposed to be done. Is this guy a breitbart journalist, but you. Okay. Donald trump has said horrendous shit about mexicans. He's fucking verified me. Say they're all. Someone's doing them raping, like he's saying crazy shit about fucking race of people that's connected to us on a landmass and he's still verified. well, why don't you unverified trump too? Like what you. What are you gonna do anytime. Anytime someone says something provocative. Yeah. I wasn't aware that the verification was supposed to be a badge of

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       approval or anything. It's supposed to be like, here's a notable personality.

Speaker 5:          02:28:26       He's notable. Yeah. He's been on a podcast that was seen by him or listened to by over a million people. That guy's notable. He's got a bright bart column that gets hundreds of thousands of fucking views. He's notable. What are you doing? Twitter, what are you doing? It doesn't make any sense and I've never heard of him doing it before. I never heard of doing it before either. I don't think they have done it before and they have definitely band people, people that there's people that deserve to be removed, but there are assholes, you know? They were ruined in ruining what twitter has established, which is a really fucking cool community. Twitter is amazing. I get everyday I get cool stories and interesting articles and interesting bits of information or corrections where people will tell me about things we've talked about on the podcast and most of the time it's really polite and I find my interactions on twitter to be really cool.

Speaker 5:          02:29:15       I mean I enjoy it a lot. I get a lot of like really cool website referrals. Like someone say, you got to check this out or check out this musician or check out this artist. Lot of really cool stuff is being exchanged through twitter, but you can't take a guy like that who's so obviously entertaining and having fun and fucking with people and has some points that he actually believes in. Where's he crossing a line? He's not crossing a line where you can ban him like he's not advocating violence or hate or going after someone or doxing them or doing something that we would all agree is fucked up. So what Is going on here? Like what? What is going on here? Why are you taking them down while you're taking the little blue checklist off

Speaker 2:          02:29:57       what I was asking you? I don't understand it. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, especially when you consider it. Like I said, it's not a badge of approval. It's not we endorse. This is just saying this is the real milo yiannopoulos, like are they taking away his identity? Are they saying that's not who he is anymore or that you know, that being that is not notable. I mean he's a breitbart journalist. He has one of the largest and most fast growing twitter followings of all time. Yeah. I mean like almost all of his twitter subscribe. Here's twitter followers which are like massive dwarfing dwarfing. Mine are in the last like 18, 19 months. Yeah. Like this guy has exploded onto the scene. Well he got 20,000 thIs week. Yeah. Just from this whole debacle. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:30:41       Guy, we need interesting people out there in this World and when people have disagreements or different opinions about certain subjects tHat are controversial and pertinent because we're all discussing them, whether it's men's rights or women's rights or whatever the fuck it is, you're going to have controversial characters who stand out and their their hot points of debate. That's this guy is, you know, you might not agree with them, you might think he's an asshole, you might not want to read his tweets anymore, so you block them. That's all fair play, but it's as soon as they decide, like I've said, some pretty fucked up shit on twitter before just to get a rise out of april and like is that we're going to decide that this am I going to be unverified now it's going to be a bunch of fake news out and one of them just happen to have one point 7 million followers. You got to find the guy with the most followers to figure out who's the real guy. That's stupid. You're ruining your community. You will allowing someone, the fact that you allow. Like I could call myself the amazing atheist in my heading. I could have my same twitter handle and just start crying. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:31:38       I'm sitting here. Yeah, that's the. That's another thing. You know, I'm sitting in a channel that has nearly 800,000 followers is getting four to 5 million views a month every month for twitter. You know, and I'm not verified. Where's my verification? I'm the real fucking amazing atheist. YOu are dude. No verification, but you kind of a rebel doll. you're on the outside. Maybe it's better like tHis know stay underground. You don't want to be that band that used to be cool and now like people don't like it because you're already know I've already experienced that bullshit. Have you sold yet? No, I haven't. I mean I'm not sold out, but. Well maybe a little here and there. Product placements. Sure. I guess I have sold out a little, but the thing is though. No, I'm more talking about like the people coming up from below that are the, you know, they're more edgy or whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:32:28       You youtube people. You mean? People coming onto the scene, like the amazing atheist is a fucking faggot bitch compared to me. I fucking tell it like it really is. That should be flattering to you that someone's trying to steal some of your thunder. It is. And it's also very flattering that they never seem to succeed. Well, we got to meet a couple that have succeeded. No, no, not that I've seen. No. The people who go, the people who would just ignore me and is trying to establish their own unique identity, they can succeed. The people who define themselves as the antithesis of me never going to succeed. Well also define themselves as your enemy and it's almost like their individuality, their identity is based on being an enemy with you. Just making yourself contingent upon me. You know, you're, you're done. Especially if you get mad at them back then, you give them poWer. You're their adversary. there must be important if tHe amazing atheist talked about me for seven minutes and people are very nice. Most people, most people are very nice. Like, I mean, um, most of the messages I get overwhelmingly positive. Most of the tweets I received overwhelmingly positive. Everyone is always cool. Everyone's always nice, you know, there's a hater here and there, but it's never really been that big of a deal.

Speaker 2:          02:33:38       Sometimes I'll say something to piss people off, you know, the things that really had been like the most offensive though, are never the things that I planned to be the most difficult. What do you think? All the videos you've ever done, what's like the most defensive point I've taken? Here's the. Here's the three things that probably piss people off the most when I did a video. Well, I did a video against ron paul once, but that was when I was a smaller channel that really piss people off. I did a video against buddhism. People really pissed because they. The strange thing about the boot boot, you know, you would never think that for doing an anti buddhist video, you would get death threats, but I did. People were like, you fucking misrepresented the tenants of buddhism, bitch. Now I'm coming for you. It's like, I think you understand them even less than I do.

Speaker 2:          02:34:25       Apparently insulted soccer. Even calling it soccer will piss a lot of football fans off. Yeah. That's the european style. If you get an american that gets mad at you call it soccer. He's a cunt. Yeah. Agreed. But I would, I've never lost more subscribers than when I made a video. Again, soccer when I said soccer is fucking stupid. I must have lost. I don't know. Uh, my channel probably had, I don't know, a hundred thousand or 200,000 at the time and I lost, you know, three or 4,000 people just for not liking soccer. I was really mean about it in all fairness. But I mean, come on, it's fucking soccer. But why and others say the same thing about baseball when I assaulted the other kid. Really? Yeah. They got this. They got super pissed. By the way, refresh your memory. Other kin is when we're talking about people that think they're foxes or computer elves or unicorn or a stapler who fucking a golf shoe.

Speaker 2:          02:35:19       Fucking golf shoes and golf shoe kid. Mom. The you easily could understand. Yup. There's a lot astral cleats coming out of my back. There's a lot of people out there that are connected to these small organizations they're very passionate about and they don't like you just sitting in your hive throwing up on youtube and hitting all over. The thing I got with, with the other kid was they said that I was a kid. I was putting minors at risk because some of the other canner minors and if I make fun of them then they're going to kill themselves and it's my fault because I made fun of. So basically, you know the guy who goes around saying, I'm a dragon. He's not the problem. The guy that says, no, you're not. That's, that's the issue. Strange logic. I agree. Well, you know, making fun of something like other kids, like someone who believes they're a fox, a in a, in a rational world is a very safe practice.

Speaker 2:          02:36:17       I agree. And rational world that is like, boy, there's almost no victims there because the person who really is a pretending they're a fox, they need to be slapped. Someone needs to wake up and hey, fuck face your, your, your name is mike. You live in toledo. You're not a fox. You're a guy. This is your mom. Does your dad. He goes to school, you talk to people, you drive a fucking car. You know how to fox. I don't know if you agree with me on this, but I mean if, if mike wants to be a furry and pretend these a fox, he knows it's pretend I'm okay. I'm okay with it. And even if he wants to be a fox for short periods of time, like really it doesn't even think he's mike, mike at all. Maybe that's like, it's cathartic release. Like he does get naked and he fucking runs through the woods on all fours and it really does feel like a fox freedom to have fun. Why not turn live dance? It's 24 slash seven thinking you're a fox, like in the grocery store walking down the aisle with your fucking cart or whatever. I'm a fox. No, that's rude.

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       That's just. Well, you know what it is, is a dummy in. There's plenty of dummies, you know, you find other things to do just. But anyway, I had away from that guy chairman to leave them alone though because uh, there are a little bit too extreme for me. They're upset because again, being this other kin as we discussed before, is this tiny, minor personal victory. If they can say, I'm a fox, I am fox kin, like now if you agree to it, now all of a sudden they've gained some traction. They've got some motion going on. It's otherwise dismal life. That's real. It's like it hurts to suck, you know, to be stuck in some horrible existence where the thing that gives you the most joy is pretending you're a chipmunk. Like, but, but pretending you're chipmunk, ken and that you'd meet up with other chipmunk king online and like how often do you guys eat acorns and you get together and you fucking sit on your knees and the park and you pretend to be a chipmunk and you enjoy the shit out of it.

Speaker 1:          02:38:12       Why? Why is it okay to golf? But that's not okay. Golfing is way fucking dumber than pretending to be a chipmunk. While we agree on that, if you, if you're playing pretend to be a chipmunk, you like trying to commensurate based. I can see why. Pretending to be a chipmunk will be fun. You get to like, golf is fun. Golf is just like, you don't. I really don't get fucking guys are bringing their wives out golfing. Like what? What's going on here? Like I have a friend of mine, he told me that he'll go golfing with his buddy and his buddy won't say that he's going to bring his wife and then just brings his wife and he's like, what in the fuck I thought were going to tell dirty jokes. I'm gonna talk shit about this girl I work with and we're going to have some fun.

Speaker 1:          02:38:54       You fucking asshole. And now we're putting the ball round with your mom because she corrects you every fucking time you say something and she's mad at you when you don't compliment her on her stupid fucking golf game. Oh man. What the fuck? Those guys are the worst dudes. You bring their girlfriend everywhere. I think the most brutal one of the most brutal. Right? You know, I don't know. Some of the most part don't ever hang out with other men, so I don't really know at all. No, not really. Whoa, what's going on there? I don't know. I don't really. I'm. I mean I'm very solitary in general, so. So when you go out and you just hang out with me, I guess I just disagree because I don't really have. I mean, let me see. How many friends do I have? I have always had with golfing.

Speaker 1:          02:39:34       Ben, scotty, chelsea. That's pretty much my three friends. Those are dudes. Yeah. Is it a handler? Chelsea handler and hanging out with her? Chelsea is my girlfriend. Oh yeah. And yeah, I mean uh, you know, I had a broader here if I could bring her to la. So I guess I am one of those dudes that just would bring her everywhere, but there's no but I can't see. I can't see her ever being like I was offended by the us or some shit. Like yeah, it's all dependent upon whether or not your chickens cool. Like, like I have friends who bring their girl everywhere and it's awesome because she's fun to hang with. It's when they bring their mom out, I mean their girlfriends, like their mom. There are dudes that have that sort of weird situation where a sorta tells them what to do.

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       Fuck that. That becomes an issue. But I guess girls have the same thing to imagine being a check. You want to have some cool fucking thing and this dummy brings her husband and I know is your party. I can't imagine myself being fun to bring places because all I, all I do is just bitched and complained yet. But it's entertaining. That's what you do. It's fun. It's fun for me. But I could see how someone else would just be like, oh my god, you just second out of the fun out of things. It's like there's no fun to be had here and that's what I'm pointing out. Fuck them. Yeah, fine. Other people that enjoy it and you have a nice whole conversation. Like if you and me we're at a party and we met, we started talking about shit. We would have probably the same conversation whether or not there was a recording of us at all.

Speaker 1:          02:40:55       Right? Yeah, true. That's what I'm saying, man. It's all good. Fuck those other people. Fuck them all. Fuck them all. Do. You're the amazing atheist trying to get away from that name that I know cause you know, it's not because a, it's not because I mean like I'm not an atheist anymore. It's just like, I don't fucking know what else to say. Right. But you're kind of tied into that name, right? Yeah. So I'm kind of trying to phase it out. How do you do that? I don't know. You're going to be like p diddy. He used to be puff daddy. No, and then he'd hit a jarring. You know, people you should do that. Like people don't like that, you know, when you just suddenly changed. I just figure I'll use tj and amazing atheist interchangeably long enough that eventually, you know, they won't notice.

Speaker 1:          02:41:36       I'm not using the amazing agency. Maybe you should have two different outfits, like one you should wear, like maybe some sort of spandex yoga type outfit, like a superhero would with a they want to see my physique, but I do just for the sake of this character, like you have two a's, like an a amazing atheist and it's like a character that you play and then you bring in tj and maybe you could have a split screen where tj and the amazing atheist can. Can have different points of view. Oh yeah. It would be like two different fucking versions. You remember when garth brooks became chris gaines do remember that? Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah. He's like the edgy garth brooks. It wasn't even the edgy. Garth brooks. He was made a behind the music. Remember that? Edgy. But it wasn't at garth brooks at all.

Speaker 1:          02:42:23       They made a fake pack. Yeah. Well they made a hole behind them that and like wearing mascara. Yeah. Well you had a crazy wig and background and drug problems you've got away from. And I was a tortured artist and he's like, you're a garth brooks. You fuck, we know who you are. Like what do you two have pretended to be this new guy? Why are you wearing a wig? Garth? What do you do it? I thought you got friends in low places with all this bullshit. What's this? Moody fucking smashing pumpkins. Shit. You know, if, if I was a. I don't know if you show me a picture of garth brooks in a wig and said, who is this? I don't think I would be like garth brooks. You not? No. You didn't know about chris gaines. I'm looking up more. Apparently he was australian.

Speaker 1:          02:42:59       Oh, chris gaines is Australia. He had a whole different country. You came from god damn. Anti american son of a bitch. I thought he was all about country music. I got friends in low places on man. I just had to listen. That shit on the bus was like fucking trent reznor. Trent reznor fuck prints. That's what you see in right there. That is so hilarious. What was he? What kind of drugs was he on? I'll tell you what. He was on fame. G-force. THat's what happened to garth brooks. The same shit that happened to elvis and fucking everybody else, man, donny and marie, all of them all.

Speaker 1:          02:43:41       I don't know what to say. You don't have to man. You don't have to know. We just, we're here. We're, we're experiencing. We're existing. We're basically out of time though. So, um, I want to thank you for doing this and give you an open invitation. Man. I enjoyed talking to you. So thank you. You want to come back? Get your fucking lazy ass out of bed on time. Make it to the airport. Don't shake your head. You can do is I surround myself with responsible people. There's like a manager type character who takes you in the road. You can pretty much. That's pretty much scotty though. You could do these like you could do live shows. You could do this on the road. We've been thinking about doing that with a drunken peasants, you know, while we're here in la, we're doing a meet up with our fans.
