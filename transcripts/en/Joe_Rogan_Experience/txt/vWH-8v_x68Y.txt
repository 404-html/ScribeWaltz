Speaker 1:          00:00:06       The joe rogan experience. Fuck it. We'll just splice it in commercials later. Todd glass. There's no reason to get all crazy. Oh, there you go. My headphones. Old School. Old School. That's not even old school. That's new school. We were just talking about this tee shirt that I'm wearing, which is a firm Cap City Comedy Club in Austin and one of the great American comedy clubs like without a doubt, one of the top three four clubs in the whole country. You know we're talking about like places that have you not hearing yourself a little hard. Oh it's too high. Too Low. Oh he can to low. Who is in here that like beautiful. That's so much work. So hard. People always say like when I do UFC broadcast, like why are you fucking screaming all the time? You were scream on TV and like if she there, you can't hear anything. Like people are so loud, like there's nothing like one of those environments. It's so fucking loud. So when we're talking before the beginning of the show, I have to talk louder. I can't even hear what the fuck I'm saying. You can't even though, you know, it's hard to imagine. Okay. I know that every, I don't know what I'm talking about. I've got lost already.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       But, uh, what I wanted to talk to you about is, I know that you had a hand in designing one of the other great comedy clubs in the country. You had a hand in designing helium, didn't you? I did. And, and you know what? I give him a lot of credit. Um, what's so funny, I just saw that fake head. Oh, this the aliens. Funny to turn to them dope, isn't it? I can hold a conversation that cat is making me a, he's making me, um, another thing, a Zombie. That guy's Badass. Oh, by the way. Uh, so I should say my opinion means anything. Cause we talked about it a little off there. This is why I don't want to insult the other podcast. It's not something they care about, you know, let me look at it that way. But like this is the coolest studio I've ever seen.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       Like you took a lot of time, like creatively to make this a cool space. The brick wall, the red curtains, the black ceiling, the lights with the like stars in them, the lava lamps, the rocks. It's like, why fucking nut, right? Yeah. Well, I wanted to do something that would make me comfortable. Like if the, if I don't think it, yeah, if you have an opera, I'm very childish and with what I like, you know, and uh, like aliens and fucking big foot and the Werewolf in the front of the place. I'm very childish, but I don't, you know, if I'm in a, in an environment that's not like me, if I'm in a like a clean, sterile environment, they'll always be like a little bit of hesitation. Even if it's a fraction, a little something that keeps, wants to, it makes you want to keep it, you know, PC or, or not be so honest or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       Office environments I think ultimately are that they like hypnotized people. I think just the idea that you're in an office, all of a sudden everybody becomes something that they're not everybody puts on this bullshit attitude. They all have this, uh, this, this weird way of behaving. No one swears, no one talks about sex. And then you know, you're not even supposed to bring up religion or politics. Supposed to like everything's supposed to be like super fake when you're dealing with customers, super flat, no personality, and really ultimately make it look super predictable for the person you're talking to. Like you're gonna follow a very strict pattern of thinking and behaving. You're a gentleman at Biz in doing business. Well, uh, yeah. That's why even then when I see managers offices, like I won't say who, but like you, this is your way to express yourself creatively.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       Which people then like if I walk into a manager's office and he gets it creatively and um, I don't know him that well, I go, I give them some points for that. Oh, this guy gets it right. This manager could have anything he want. It's not like he, it looked like hertz and we are still behind his back. Go, what? This is what he wanted. Like this is like if you had to go, ah, fuck it. Look at me. I work at Hertz. Look at my office. He goes, I want that. Look. Anyway, that story is available in store. Okay. I did sort of don't give a fuck though. Right? It's something that they don't put self analyze myself. All I'm worried about my, that story was horrible. I don't even remember what the story is. That's where I'm at. I swear to God, I swear to God that's how much I get lost.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       Wow. And now I'm going to just talk about wherever I'm at. Dude, we got bookmarks for you. Do you? Don't worry. You don't have to worry. We'll always refresh you and let you know what we're talking about in every conversation. We're ready. Hi Person Professional. When it comes to be and I were excellent at it. Did you ask me a question that we're talking about helium? Actually, we were talking about you having a say in the design because somebody had told me like before I'd ever worked there, it's like the best club in the country. They were like, this place is perfect. It's like everything you want to club, low ceilings. People are packed in tight. A great neighborhood. It's really cool. Neighborhood is a lot of their bars and jazz clubs and like there's a lot of funky shit in that area and that club is just perfectly set up.

Speaker 1:          00:04:42       And then they told me that you had a hand in designing it. Yeah, mark called me and he uh, uh, through uh, Lewis Lee or somebody from Minneapolis and they said, you're opening up a club and uh, you know, um, is that the guy from acme? He's the one. Zach, well, back to backtrack a little, which I thought was cool that mark even knew to do. I go, how did you know to call Lewis Lee? He also called him. Louis basically taught him how to run a club. Well Acmes another exam. I've never worked at acme but I was there recently. I was hanging out with the arch barker and he was working there and it's a fucking amazing place. It is. It's perfect. And all comedians like it. Mark did the guy who opened up helium, I'm like, well how'd you know to pick him? Like, how'd you know acne?

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       He goes, oh, I went to a comedy festival as a, as a non club owner, just a guy who thinks he wants to open up a club and he has every comedian what their favorite club was. He goes, who? You're attacking me a lot. He goes, that sounds like a guide. Want to talk to? I go, that's so brilliant. He goes, it's just common sense. I go, yeah, but it's every, most people don't have it. It's like we were talking about cops the other day and I love cobb's cobb's in San Francisco. I started at the old cobb's, which is a really tiny place. It don't mention cops. To me it was this kid and you know how many people, no matter what you're talking about, hey, don't mention anybody I can mention around you and then you have to ask them why and then it becomes about that.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       That's really what it is. Let's guys are annoying. That's exactly what it is. They turn it into something about them. It doesn't have to do with what you're about to say. That's to do with their personal trickled. Did I count it every seat in the room. He's 180 seats. She told me 270 sheet rooms or stealing 10 seats. Oh God. Those guys are the worst. Those guys that are getting robbed everywhere they go. And I'm not saying that people haven't been robbed before. Legitimize. It's when it happens, obviously come on every story. These people have so many stories. It's like I've taught class hasn't been ripped off. Why have you been ripped out? What the fuck is going on that you keep getting ripped off by who you mentioned? Oh, Vinnie APAM squats off. Well, there's a show for him. There had to be at least a thousand people.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       It gives me a check, 80 bucks. Fuck that shit. And there's certain guys that just have an animosity towards, uh, club owners. There's a almost like a natural animosity because of the fact that like in the beginning, they didn't want to have anything to do with you. You were real like rejected girl, you know, that isn't mature yet. You know, get real emotional about it and very upset. And then when the guy comes around, you're like, where the fuck were you when I was 18 you know, people get crazy. All right. I think comedians get that way too. We'll need. Then in the beginning they're fucking terrible. So nobody wants to use you. You can't work anywhere and you have to slowly work your way into a position where someone's actually willing to pay you to have their customers hear you talk. And that's a really kind of a special relationship.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       And the beginning part is so bad that we developed this weird sort of contentious relationship sometimes with club owners. I think that's like really ridiculous. You know? I think you're right. I think you're right. And again, because I'm overly paranoid, we're not saying that certain people haven't legitimately maybe been ripped off shore. And when that happens, that sucks. What we're saying, like a lot of that animosity comes from exactly what you just said. It's like you, maybe you were bad. Then maybe you know, maybe this, maybe that may be, you know, but they're not all bad people. Well, a lot of good ones. It took me a while to get the respect of the people that I came up with in Boston, like the clubs in Boston. I was headlining on the road before I was headlining back in Boston again because they saw me when I was terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       I mean, they saw me as an open mic or I should never been allowed to go on stage. So when, so when you seen someone just fucking stink it up hardcore for like, you know, a year or two in the beginning of their career, it's just, it just makes sense that you wouldn't want and you're like, five years later you're like, Chrissy, man, I'm not buying it. This guy's gotta be still terrible. You know, I saw him when he was an open miker and every comedian sorta says that they have to like leave your town and get success elsewhere and then they respect it and recognize it. But if they see you when you suck in their mind, you suck. Like Pete, it's really hard for people to adapt. It's works that way with athletics too, with fighting. It works that way. And these guys that believe that this guy can't beat them. There's no way that guy could be me. My like, I just you like, it's

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       craziness. It's a crazy way of thinking. But they know back when the guys sucked and they refuse to admit that people can figure things out that people can improve.

Speaker 3:          00:09:05       Yeah. I even have that happen, but I try not to like, I'll think I'll think of somebody the way I thought about them. You know somebody, there's a comedian wanted to, Oh, a Jew, a middle in Philadelphia and I, and I really think of, well, you're probably like, oh wait, I haven't seen him in a while. And then I take the time, I'm like, oh my God, I just got stuck in this mindset, but at least I got out of it. I love the comedian that it's about, don't fucking find it. If it's not useful. You know what you but don't be so sure you might, okay. I'm very sorry it's you, but don't be so sure there's somebody on that has to be me. I'm from Philly. I worked with Todd and Philly. Wasn't he? Just say my name. Give me a plug. People are too damn sensitive about a people's assessments of them.

Speaker 3:          00:09:45       As long as those assessments are polite, you shouldn't take it to fucking personally. You can learn from those things. Yeah. I had a comedian once. You know what? I'm glad that I just luckily wasn't stupid because he goes, I could have easily been offended, but early in my career, he goes, well, hung out during the day and then he goes, he said this affectionately, I remember it. I was like 23 maybe 24 he goes, he goes, you're funny hanging out. He goes, what are you doing up there on stage? You know? Like I knew he was fucking right and he knew I could handle it. You know? He said something, he goes, that's what you want to be doing. But I, but I remember thinking I could have easily been like fucked up. Right. That's my story. You know what my story could have been then this fucking idiot tells me I'm fun me offstage, but I'm not. Fuck you. I was doing better than you every night when she might've been because he was bad, but whatever. He was honest with me. And, um, instead the story is, thank you, I appreciate it. He said that it made me consciously tried to change that

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       there was a guy that said something to me when we were both starting out together. We had been both doing it about six months and, uh, I was still like, I still had my foot in another world. I was still teaching martial arts since I was still competing. And I was really confused. And he said to me, goes, you know, he was being a Dick, totally being a dick. He goes, you started off pretty funny man, but you, uh, you lost promise. He seemed to be repeating yourself and it's just like you, uh, I dunno. It seems like you've lost momentum. And I was like, wow. And I didn't argue with them. That was the weird part. I didn't like, fuck you bitch. You know, there was none of that. I just went, wow, I got to agree with you. Like I'm not really paying attention a comic.

Speaker 2:          00:11:21       And Open Miker that I worked with that you know, we would, you know, we were all like sort of competitive young guys and going to these school, I try to be, I have some camaraderie, but there was always a glad we were young, we were retarded, we didn't know how to communicate with each other. We didn't know how to be honest and express ourselves and we were insecure as fuck. We're trying to be a standup Comedians, most insecure world, probably in show business. He created all yourself and he said something that was totally true and I remember it. It's tall, it's stung for sure, but it made me make a clear decision to, to just abandon the other, to [inaudible] to completely remove myself, quit my job, just get, get jobs, like paying for things just because that's what one thing is. One Guy said that it helped me a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       Like I could say like he was being a dick when he was doing it and I'm sure he was, I'm sure he's trying to hurt my feelings, but he was right and because he was right, it was really beneficial. It was really important and it was really important, like for me as a comedian to mate, first of all, to be aware that that this has to apply this way. Although it's like very difficult to do, especially emotionally, it's very difficult to accept criticism. It's very difficult to see people see yourself as other people see you, but it's so fucking important. If you can't do that, like you're, you're gonna, you're gonna never continue to grow. You're going to hit a rough spot and then boom, you're going to tail spin and then that's it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:39       Yeah. You see that a lot. Fuck yeah, you do. It's funny people too. That's what's a shame. Like it's not funny, but they get caught in this, something goes wrong. Yeah. Or like, and like we said before, the ones that I remember, comedians that had fucked this business attitudes. I'm not kidding. Like now of course then it seemed like they had been doing comedy a long time, but like eight years into the business, right. Fuck this. Fuck this business. We're two years in. I remember it comedian having a joke, like, hey, here.

Speaker 2:          00:13:06       Really? That's so silly that man. Well, it's the same thing. It's like a rejected boy or a rejected girl. Rejected young person, I should say. It doesn't have emotional maturity and they get angry. That's really what it is. Like that rejection sometimes is the best fucking thing that can ever happen to you. Like it might feel like shit, but you'll figure that out because of it. You're either going to quit, are you going to figure it out? You're going to have a new inspiration

Speaker 4:          00:13:31       suit so that you know what? Um, I would never want to own a club. When I complain about club owners, I've realized I'm not changing this. Does it seem like I'm changing the subject? Not at all. Not at all. You're right. I'm going. I know exactly what you got because I do make fun of the bad clubs and I do. I spend a lot of time making fun of the bag clubs and they should be made fun of. Some of them have fucking, they're horrible, but I also defend the good clubs. I wouldn't want to own a good club. You know why? Imagine all the fucking whack a doodle comedians fucking bothering them and getting mad at them unnecessarily. Like, you know, not all of them. I wasn't. I was, I remember thank God and I did a lot wrong, but I always knew that like I, I forgot, I completely forgot what I was talking.

Speaker 4:          00:14:17       We're talking about clubs and like getting along with clubs and I never got mad at club owners over the years when a club wouldn't use me. You know what all at all I liked is when they told this story, and I can think of a specific club that said this. I wasn't what they wanted, but they said, you know, he was nice and he, the staff liked them because it's just not my thing. But he tried to point out that I was at decent guy and you know what? I accepted it. I was like, I remember someone was like, fuck him. I go, no, no, no. He has a right, he can't love every comedian, but at least he told that's not the story I could have told. I could have been like, oh yeah, I could have

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       been that same story could have been even though the guy did it right and he tried to, I could have been like, fuck him. You know what he tells my manager, the staff flight to the Fox that supposed to mean, you know what I mean? Like flipping it around negative. Totally. Yeah. So it was so, and there was a few clubs over the years that wouldn't hire me and guess what? Some Jew now and uh, I, you know, I didn't want to be that person. I'll fuck that club. They will now. They want you. So what do you want to teach them a lesson? Love the fact that they exist. I mean, one of the best things about being a comedian is the ability to work in clubs. I do some larger spots now and I, but I still do like the ice house. Like I deal with the Ice House on a lot of Wednesday nights and it's only like 150 people or 190 people or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       It's fucking amazing. It's a magical room. I mean it's, it's magical. It's tight. The ice house is dark and it's got 50 fucking years of laughs burned into it, you know, I mean that's legit. That place. If, uh, an area or a space can encode a memory, can somehow or another capture a memory. Like if you go to, my dad went to Gettysburg and he said when he was there, he felt sad. He said it really was a overwhelming feeling of sadness. He goes, it was really hard to describe. He's not an airy fairy sort of a woo woo kind of a guy. And when he said that about Gettysburg, he's an architect and I said that about Gettysburg. He was like, he was just something about it. It just didn't, just, you could feel it in the air. I really believe that. I believe a club like the laugh stop in, uh, in Houston.

Speaker 1:          00:16:20       Did you ever work at that? Stop that place, that place you walked in, you said you felt it in your fingers. You're like, Whoa, this place is on fire. Mark Babbitt is the reason that club used to have a great reputation. And I love, let me tell you something I don't wish anybody ill on. I don't wish anybody ever, I don't care what they do. I do not wish anybody ill. But I do wish that your empire would fall apart. It doesn't mean anyone would be sick or homeless or, but you're, I do wish your empire would fall apart. Like it did not realizing Mark Babbitt was why you had it. They never knew that he was the soul of that place. So when he left it went down hill and they have no idea to this day, do you think they have the intelligence to go, hey, what happened there?

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       We made a huge mistake. We had a manager who fucking basically gave them, you know, we didn't know how important he was. We fired them. And the business slowly closed. No, they're just telling some other's bullshit story. Was there a matter of, I don't know, there was some sort of a legal matter. I don't want to mention what might or might not have happened because honestly I've just rumors. I guess what I heard from fucking Ralphie minor knew it that fuck I totally turned on him. He was a, you know, a guy who really loved comedy and that's a historic fucking club. Maybe Bill Hicks recorded, didn't Bill Hicks one of his standup specials there? Saint Man, I think, I'm not sure, but I know that um, one of his early special said sure. But I wasn't positive. I think it was there. Um, and that's, that used to be where the, the, the annex was, you know, we're s Kinison started out and Hick started out like you would walk into that

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       last stop in river oaks. There was two laptops. It was the one and then they moved it. When they moved it, that's when things started getting squirrelly. But the original one, you would walk into that place and you would feel the fucking energy that has been pumped out into that room. Like these people have like years and years, a fucking hysterical

Speaker 3:          00:18:09       gold laughter. Like impregnates the walls. You want to hear new place. Didn't have that. Do you want to hear what you're talking about? But someone took advantage of this and works at for them when they sell homes, I swear to God, this is what a girl told me. It'll, it goes back to exactly what we're talking about. She goes, you want to know my line? I say, when I'm selling, someone's selling some of the house. She goes, I say of House has sold this. I don't you feel like this has a good one. And she goes, most people like, oh yeah. Especially if they liked the house, but she's full of shit. She's lying. She's just saying that. But every half else, that's such a good line that people go, yeah, I it does have a good soul and, but, but she's working on something that does exist as we're talking about. Cause I agree. There's no way those laughters it's not just in our head, that's something there, that's some energy when a room has had that much, you know, not out that much soul. You know, I don't, I mean it sounds like horse shit. Makes Sense. Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:19:02       Uh, any reasonable scientist would tell us it's horse shit. Oh really? But maybe, maybe it does for us symbolically because you know what that like when I walk into the punchline, Atlanta de Jesus Christ, I mean that place has been around forever. It's a fucking masterfully bill club. Another one perfect comedy club. And you see those pictures of the wall like Richard Jenny when he was like 30,

Speaker 3:          00:19:24       you're like, wow, like look at these fucking headshots. So like all these old, old headshots, xannies and Nashville. You ever do that place? I love, all you can do is look at those pictures every night and find something new to the figure out. That time I never get tired. I read, look at them. I look at them. Any of those clubs, I know that there's a breed club you're talking about. It's not a helium because they don't haven't been open as right, but it's those 35 year olds, 35 year old clubs or clubs, those walls. Holy Shit. I remember the person I thought I look up at the wall. Anybody that had a gimmick, I thought they were going to be really successful. Like one guy who was called the coach and had a whistle and I was thinking I was like 19 I'll be like fuck, I wish I would have thought I was always so jealous. Yeah, I get it. Blows the whistle and I'm the coach got damn it. That's it. I was always so jealous of those and then they tend not to be doing comedy. You know what I was really jealous of of

Speaker 2:          00:20:16       the dudes who had like the, the big full page ads in that comedy guide. Do you remember the comedy guide? I sorta do. The comedy guide was this, it was an industry comedy guy that would come out like every year, like all the managers would have it and they would, these, these comedians would take out these giant full page ads and show like what Naca Conference, you know they perform dad and performing at colleges lot and they, they had like this really professionally done photography and shit. Like that was how comedians got the

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       word out about it and that's how they marketed these stuff. To buy time in the industry guide and then put together some VHS tape and send it out the cards. Did you ever have a comedy card? No, never had it. We had a card once to promote a website that I put out to promote my website, but there was never one for like, like, you know, I'm appearing in this town like with like pointing to the right and the big some someone told me, what am I coming to you? Someone told me that uh, um, my track record is this and then I'll tell you what somebody told me George Carlin said, but at least I wish I could've said I never had a card. But I am proud to say if I'm going to be 100% honest, I had one for like a month and then I just didn't like the smell of it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:33       So he got rid of it. I know. Yeah. I was like, no tog glass comedian, I was like, Oh shit. I think I saw some other comedian with a car and I'm like, I should have cards, you know? And then I got rid of him. So now I'm glad because someone said somebody at the, George Carlin was talking about cards backstage at the comedy magic club and basically said, he goes, God, you know, and the community doesn't have a fucking card, you know. And then the comedian that had the card sort of felt like he took them very quickly over to the trash because he had just gotten cards. Yeah. That was a thing about headshots back in Boston. Anybody who's any good had the shitty headshot, they didn't give a fuck about their headshots. Right, right. And you can see that same, that same path.

Speaker 1:          00:22:14       And they would talk about it like if you hire a photographer to do your headshot, you fucking suck on stage. That was like, those are just such an unspoken are their exception. Yes. But no, mostly that's such a great, well there's something that makes you want to take a picture of yourself and be all sexy looking. That's Uber Douchey and it doesn't translate into comedy. You know, there's some guys who could ham it up. Like I remember Kevin Knox had like are really zany like Ted shot, but it worked for him cause that was like his act like he was a wild energetic guy. What if I talk about how bad that is and I agree with you, but then you guys pull in line a picture of me with my shoe is a phone. Todd, we found this picture of you like, Oh that with the shoe.

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       Yeah. It was like, it was a fun, nobody did that then. No, I was really the first. You know what my favorite is guys who do characters and they have like multiple characters on their head shots. Like this is the hillbilly. This is doctor. Does anybody still do that? No Man. I don't know. Someone was on the podcast, I don't know who to credit for this, but they were talking about how um, uh, you guys would know, you guys remember about how the genre of prop comedy's gone. Carrot top room moved it. You can't be a prop guy anymore. But when we were starting out, that was an option. It was like prop guys. There was, you know, regular standup comics. There was dirty guys, it was prop guys. The prop guy doesn't exist anymore. You never see the prop guy anymore. Carrot top essentially just

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       dominated the market so thoroughly that everybody else abandoned it. Let me, let me say this, if somebody out there was willing, this is a real offer to like let's say they had money and they think it's a good idea and then I could give them, I will give them 40% of all my income. If somebody goes, I will pay for it. Todd, we build him a great property, like we hire writers and it's the, it's like an anti prop act. I would go tour with it if somebody was willing to put money into it, like producing go, you were going to hire, we're going to build this. It's going to be a truck. It's going to go and you're going to do a, but we're going to put money into it. Somebody out there, promoter have creator, half promoter. Thanks. I'd fucking do that. You would ask 40% per, I want to put it down on record, but we will talk about the fee.

Speaker 3:          00:24:27       You would actually be the perfect guy to put together like a fake prop act, like a prop act as that you have like, but no disrespect, disrespect to it. It would be just like the opposite of it. Like there'd be like these weird like, I don't know, he would just make it shitty the way you know, like you, if you're going to make fun of a comedian, you tell a bunch of shitty jokes and the punchline, now it's, you're not disrespecting comedy, shitty comedy. Right? So that was what you would do. You'd be disrespecting a shitty prop back. Yes. And it would be just almost a mock of a project that didn't put a lot of time into his props. Like, no, he's just like tape. You know? He's like pulling things out that are obviously, and they're not even, he goes, it used to be taped together.

Speaker 3:          00:25:07       He shows the crowd. It was a few guys that were like combination. They would like have a few props and they would do comics. Do you remember Dennis? Melanie. Lenny Shoultz. Do you remember crazy? Lenny? Jesus Christ. He would, he would pick up a fucking smokey the bear. Okay. He had a smokey the bear doll and he would only, you can prevent forest fires. Then he'd go fuck you and punched the bear. And that was so ridiculous. It would knock the bear like through the crowd. Like fuck you. This is completely silly. Duncan Trussell in it. Does a prop back are used to with little Hobo. Well it's hacky. That's a little different though. That there's another level. That's the other level. That's the, the, the puppet master guy. The puppet is a, another video camera. That kind of, Jeff Dunham is pretty much dominated now. I mean there's still a few other guys.

Speaker 3:          00:25:58       Like there's the, uh, the guy a faith tour. What's his name? Fader. Terry Fator. Terry Fator. Oh yeah, a big one in Vegas as well. Um, and, but that's, you know, there's not like many young guns out there with a fucking taking a doll to a coffee club and he's got a lot of guys that are rocking that Ad. I think so. You know the visual of the hand just instantly. I just picture the comedy club. I was just out a week ago. What are the odds? Like I would walk up on stage seriously and you put your hand up and made the fake puppets. Well, the best of all time, best of all time in my opinion is auto and George the best of all time I worked with Datto. We did a gang of gigs in a danger fields in New York. We did prom

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       shows, which are helacious. Have you ever done the prom show? Oh I've, I've done a, yeah, one or two when they have them in New York City where they just keep funneling the people into the club. They get these kids from high schools and they bring them in and they, they don't end the show. They tell you to do new material every time and they, they are, they tell you not to do new material, that to tell you the same material every time so that they would realize that the show was over because they never cleaned the place out. They just kept packing kids in there, uh, violating every fire code in existence and would, and it would go on til five o'clock in the morning. I mean, you would start working at eight at night and you would do shows until five o'clock in the morning.

Speaker 1:          00:27:22       They would just keep rotating the lineup. I would leave and it would be light out. It was madness. But for like a young comic, it's a pretty good cause it's like 75 bucks a sat or something like that and you're packing all those sets together. So it was, it was, uh, a good chunk of money for, for Canadians. So a lot of us did it and odd when I did band and we did a I a couple of clubs, I'd never got to work with him that much. I only get to see him like three times live. I remember just punching, you know, it's nice when you go to see someone like that and the people around you are enjoying as much as you do, like a ton of people in really fucking enjoy him. And then I feel like there's like people like me that go, it's fucking, I can't handle it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:59       I want to be around those people and I wouldn't wear, the last time I saw him, the couple next to me, husband and wife, I found that they were w I, we just started punching each other and we're glad we had someone, the punch, you know, and the people ahead of us. We're sort of the same way. Everyone else was loving it, but we were definitely going, I'm going to die. You know, it was just so, it is what it comedy festival. And he was saying health, desperate, older comedians. And then he went, I give to understand. I felt like I never saw them my whole life when he, when he goes, um, like something happens. And then de jure, I get it mixed up right now I'm talking about, oh, and George auto would say, uh, he'd say as a woman in the crowd, like, hey, how are you? And He, the puppet would mock him.

Speaker 3:          00:28:40       It's crowd work was holy Shit. Are you shitting me? That's what you find in a Lillian. He has stopped to chauffeur. Hey, hello. Oh, he goes up. Then it would like to see a puppet really dig into a human being. I had never seen that, and for me that was fucking unbelievable. He used to have a fucking thing he was working on. It was Kennedy getting shot in the head and saw the puppet's head would flip back like a flop up of scalp, which he goes and I want to figure out how to put a brain in there. Maybe square blood out of it. That's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          00:29:13       He was so funny and people will get mad. They would go, I see your lips moving. He didn't try to hide that. His lips are moving like, what is he not understanding what he's doing? I see. Guess what? That has to be certifiably. No, no, no, no bullshit. A problem with the mental, the mental disability. It's a fucking puppet. Of course, his lips are moving. Just pay attention to what he's doing, but that's someone there that was taking it for face value. Oh Wow. How was he? Well, I didn't hard to get past the blips. You know, I saw his lips moving. So George, obviously he's still doing club dates. Yeah, he's a maniac, but he's just so crazy. I know. So He's, he's fucking hilarious. What was that picture of me? You're in a prop. What was it? You and a bag. Oh, did somebody make, did I used to do props?

Speaker 3:          00:30:06       No, I don't think I did that ever. I do that or did they Photoshop? It looks like it was like a red carpet event. You from the American beauty or something like that. Oh, Jesus. I wonder if, I wonder if there's hope for, for the, uh, what, what would they call him? Puppet acts. What's the, somebody will have to do it. Great. Ventriloquist. Yeah. The wonder. Yeah. I mean it feels, I feel like that's a genre that can be fucked with, you know, Dunkin did it, but he only did it for like this one bit, which is hilarious. Beautiful. A Little Hobo. Little Hobos is evil puppet and killed his grandfather and he does this one bit. It's fucking genius, but it's not a lot of like young guys. And he'd go to a club. It's very rare that you see a young guy that's a puppet act.

Speaker 3:          00:30:51       Yeah. Yeah. You don't, is there anything else? We're not thinking of a willy, Tyler and Lester. He was another famous ones. Yeah. No, I mean that you don't think of another type of comedy. Yeah. Oh, oh. Any style. When I think of someone doing it, I think if somebody has may be mocking it. That's what, but what about not mocking it? Could somebody come back and make it? It was just that good and they, right. Why can't it be good banter between the puppet and the person? Certainly the book it is with Auto, right? That's what I'm saying. But we're, we're excluding him guys. He's got some jokes where he goes back and forth with the puppets that are pretty fucking funny. We'll know then. Then that to me is always amazing. But I know that the, the cliche stuff, it's like, I think Jeff Dunham does it like more of like family friendly.

Speaker 3:          00:31:34       Like he tries intentionally to sort of, uh, is there a good psychic, does that exist? Well, I mean like comedian psychics, I've never even heard of one. I've heard of a comedy hypnotists. Juva juvenile never. Oh, you have an opinion on that. They'll way it works. It definitely works. Yeah. Comedy hypnotism is 100% real. Okay. Here's why I'm sort of, not that you're the all knowing, but you know, I usually, you probably broke it down without even getting into detail. You probably shred it the fuck out of it. And so I think you probably know the right answer. So I'm glad because here's what my problem with is. If it was fake and I thought, no, I can't explain it, but here's what I used to say. I can't explain it. I don't. But here's the one thing. If it's fake, how come never do those audience members on stage break? Never. Never. Now. So are they in some hip? What's happening here? You can tell they can tell a good guy whether someone's under not. And some people you just can't hypnotize. I think there's really some people that have brains that are easier to hack. I agree. I think you could just get into him. I'll tell you this for a fact because I worked with a named Frank Santos,

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       the r rated hypnotist. I worked with him many, many, many, many, many times. Back in the Boston days when I was an open miker and I was 100% skeptical, the first time I saw it I was like, this is bullshit. These people, I'll just faking it, but then when you watch a guy actually come in his pants and you watch people do things that he's telling them to do, then you realize, oh, wait a minute. I'm a control freak. It would never work on me, but it works on some people. Some people, especially in the, in that context, it actually might work better because they're nervous and they get on stage and there's a bright light and this guy just knows how to lock you in and tell you what to do, tell you what to do. You're going to breathe, you're going to breathe in on the count of five, you're going to just go, you're going to go to sleep, relax all the muscles in your body.

Speaker 1:          00:33:21       One, two, three, four, five. And he would touch these guys and they would fucking collaterally for me. I could just feel that. I swear to God. No, I mean it just let it in. Three seconds just to go. Someone is counting down and let your shoulders down. But he was a real hypnotist first and then he got into comedy hypnotist. Let me ask you this, and someone that knows a lot about this might even say, well no Todd, that's not hypnotism, but what? Even if it's this, because look, they get laughs and the average person to get laughs, it's how's it feel to get laughs? It feels unfucking believable. So let's say even if a Naysayer said, I, ed tries to answer the question this way, I still might not negate to hypnotism, but what if a Naysayer said, now they're just getting lamps. And when people get those type of lifts, they get comfortable.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       So they get, they let their guard them because everything they do is getting a laugh. They're getting a laugh cause there's a professional up. They're making it happen. So maybe they get more comfortable and more comfortable. So the more weirdness is thrown at them, they're getting the laugh. It feels good. And they go to the, you're still take him somewhere. So if you're doing it through laughter there, you're taking them somewhere to do some shit that they're not doing in their normal lives. Yeah, I don't, I don't know what the conscious, like the interpretation of the person who's actually doing it to some of them see what they're doing to other ones. See something that's not even there. I don't, I don't understand that because one of them he did, he said, uh, he was, he had a weird way of talking about a very strange accent and he'd say, you about to make love to Madonna.

Speaker 1:          00:34:47       Madonna is on the ground. She's naked. You're on top of a, you're going to make love to Madonna. And this guy starts fucking, I mean, he starts fucking, and the crowds is, is it stitches? Stitches Comedy Club in Boston. This is the stitches to the second stitches. There's one that was attached to the paradise. It was this old school place that's the first place that ever performed an open mic night at that place went under and then they opened up a new place and this was at the new place. He, the guy came in his pants. I saw the guy come in his pants like, I mean, I ain't go go look at them. But I mean it was pretty obvious that the guy came in his pants and he was embarrassed and everyone was laughing and he didn't know what the fuck they were laughing at.

Speaker 1:          00:35:28       He was gone. He was in a weird other place and when he snapped him out of it, you could tell the guy is, I don't think they're that good of an actor. I think that you are skeptical because it wouldn't work on you at all and I don't think it would work on me there. But think about some of the shit that people are willing to do. Think about cults. Think about people joining cults that they think about people that believe that some, some guy who lives in Siberia is Jesus. And so they're going to set up these huts and live up there with Jesus because Jesus is back and he lives in Siberia. Do you have to be like, there's something has to be like really wrong with your brain for you to accept that? I think people's brains are jiff and just like people's dicks are different.

Speaker 1:          00:36:11       That's what I think. And I think some people you can just tell them what to do and they'll just lock into it and just do it. Yeah. I mean, cause if you, we, we know that like the first part of what you said is true because it's happened in the past. People following cold. So like, so what if that light, light, light, light, light is someone just doing that for an hour? Like they'll do that. Why won't you just go, you know, like there's yeah, right. People. Yeah. There's a lot of your Ryka I always, um, I always, uh, forget that. I'm like, really? But then you think, yeah, that's you. I'm thinking of me picking at me. Yeah, you can't think of you because you have an extraordinary job. It's very, you have a very unusual amount of people that you come in contact with and share your ideas with and you're on stage all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:36:58       This is like your, your comfort level with humans is different than the average person's comfort level cause he experienced humans and it's really extreme state, the state of a standup comedy club. So it's real hard to, to just couldn't hypnotize a guy like you. But there's some people out there that have nine volt brains and you know, everybody else has a, a bunch of those lithium ions. They used to run a Tesla, not this motherfucker. He's got a nine volt brain just like God gives some men two inch painting says this guy has a nine volt brain and that is what he's got. You know, and I say this from a person who's very acutely aware of how smart I am or how lack of smart I am. You put a math problem in front of me, I start fucking drooling. I'm an idiot. I'm really bad when it comes to math.

Speaker 1:          00:37:42       Like I'm shockingly bad. You know, there's just shit I'm not good at even slightly. But I know that it's, I'm not confused. You know what I mean? Could it, cause you're able to know where you're, you're right. I get what you're saying. So I know there's different levels. I know there's people that are way smarter than me. I just know it. I've a, because mathematically I feel like I, I'm, I'm horrible at math too. Right? I know I didn't choose that. That so you're saying there might be people that get the math thing but then socially or like given these nine volt batteries and that's, you think it's not changeable? I think it is. I think if I had interest in, in mathematics, but what I'm saying is I don't, and because I don't, I don't have any knowledge of it, so I'm really dumb when it comes to that subject.

Speaker 1:          00:38:27       It's not something I've ever pursued. So because of that, I completely lack any comprehension of like really advanced calculus. And you only see like those physics guys, I have zero knowledge of what that is. It's because when I was a kid, I associated it very early with something incredibly boring and because I did that, I just never put any effort into it whatsoever. It wasn't rewarding to me. I think that's what, yeah, I think that's what makes things, it's you should have a comprehensive knowledge of how to count and divide and all those things. The absolutely, but it doesn't appeal to everybody and to make a guy like you or make a guy like me chase after like really complex math, it's not really beneficial because it's not going to do anything more than let us know that we don't really like math, especially in this day and age because there's not a matter of there's a finite amount of time to learn things when you're in high school, finite amount of time in college and finite amount of the time. When you have a job, he's so fucking small amount, so cut out all the shit you're not really that interested in. There's plenty of fucking calculators out there. Stop trying to be mister renaissance man. When it comes to knowledge, there's a calculator punching those numbers, get it done. It's really easy. Even help board don't or be a math guy.

Speaker 3:          00:39:37       I'm so bad at math. Now granted this look sad or this looks Saturday. This is going to tell Saturday than it is, but it is a true story. So it all has to do with math and how bad I am and I have to tell you that I like bubble tape. There's a reason I have to tell you that because I don't know why, but I'll buy bubble tape. You know pop, pop, pop stuff comes in. It's like baseball tape and you pull a piece out. You can make it like 10 feet long. You know it's all in. It's all like in a, it's like, I know what I'm talking about. It's like one big long piece of gum and then you pull it out. It's gum, you chew gum bubble, bubble tape go. Oh. Oh, okay. It's hard to, most people listening are probably, they'll, they'll know.

Speaker 3:          00:40:16       I'm like, that's my, that's like meet a nice way of me going. Everyone knows with you I think, but I could be wrong. I bet you're right. I'm an idiot. Um, so, uh, so anyway, so I'm on the plane and I'm horrible with numbers and I have like I'm at this, I have a checkbook and I'm opening it up, you know, cause I, and I'm counting with my fingers and I'm figuring something out. And also then I take a piece of bubble tape and I eat it at the same time. And then I, there's a guy in my brief and I look at him like, oh my God, I thought instantly what he had just seen like not a man my age county with his fingers, you know, pull it Eaton bubble tape. There's no way you think there's, I have any amount of success.

Speaker 3:          00:40:54       He has to think, oh that poor guy, good for him. Get on a plane and oh, am I one of the look up? No, no, I swear everything. All right. It looks very archaic but I don't like I'm aware. So it's funny that that's eccentric. Like to eat childish sort of candy that we have like in categorized like this is candy for children. Well, it's true. It's like if God forbid and I don't, so don't worry about judging me. Those big lollipops you can get. Oh yeah. What if you really liked go as a full grown adult eating one of those big lollipop? I think you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want knickers on you. I think it's so stupid. Can I tell you I wish you like those and I'll tell you why. Because if you did, I hang out with you every night and just see if anyone gave you shit.

Speaker 3:          00:41:38       I would love to see it. What's up man? You know I like these lollipops. You would address it. The lollipop industry would love you because he'd be like, it's Nice Joe Rogan's out there, but they give him shit about eating. The big lolly puppy tells him to go fuck himself handedly bringing back the fanny pack, Todd glass or you can go handedly. I wear it everywhere. I wear it every time I go on the road. People point to it. And you'll get the fuck out of here. And I go, yeah, I'm wearing a fat. It's fucking easy. It's easy to travel with. You know? I don't know if I'll ever wear one, but I've said this a million times. Why can't the fanny pack be cool to where it is? I don't. I have shit. Mike flew long nights just with where to put pot. That lollipop. Exactly the one I was thinking I would eat one of those where you talk last car confused.

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       Look at that fucking lollipop. That's a lot of sugar sign. How much sugar is that Todd glass. That's a fucking hard piece of sugar that weighs pounds. I don't think it probably puts you in a straight diabetic coma. A girl should not eat that and not be looking for and it guy or girl. If you're out licking that lollipop nonstop that Amar and I don't think if people, you're going to attract some Weirdos board or some people who really admire your tongue. Exactly. Yeah. Maybe you have a really sweet tongue. I mean, you know, some girls stick their tongues out and they go all the way down their chin and he, yeah. [inaudible] your friends would say, dad, you're looking at that lollipop and public. It's, you're, you're only going to attract the wrong type of guy. You can't attract the right type of guys. Fuck, hey, let's get it as Josie has, would say, let's get this party started, Brian.

Speaker 3:          00:43:11       Okay. Alright, listen, stop it. Brian. Stop it. You confusing everything. Um, yeah. Well I think like lollipops, like anything else, man, look, whatever the fuck you like this. We aren't here for a long time. If you like something, they just say you like it and say why you like it. And when, when I, when I say it was bringing back the fanny pack, you know, people thought it was joking. Like I've really never stopped wearing one. When I travel I'd wear of the people would constantly mocked me. I'm like, I don't care. It's a fucking, it's, I think it's insane that I can wear a backpack and no one gives a shit, but everywhere pack down here, all of a sudden it's something that's funny. I'm like, that's gears. Nothing. And here's the thing. You're right. But here's the problem. Here's the problem. Like I know you're right and not only do I know you're right, but the here comes, there's the end part. Um, I've said it over the last year so many times, especially if if, uh, if you have a pipe or a key I playing, I don't like to have my phone on me. I thought she got damn it. Why can't fanny packs like I just said be, why can't they be cool to where we're bringing him back? Todd glass?

Speaker 3:          00:44:11       I don't know. If I have, I'd be too insecure. I be too insecure. Just everywhere I went. People would be like, look, that guy wearing a fanny pack. He would feel like you were being courageous, but it makes courageous and just carrying stuff. Wear sweatpants. Fuck it. Sweatpants and a fanny pack. Fuck him. Who am I dressing up for some nice soft cotton sweatpants. Those are like the most comfortable things ever, you know? But we never wear him. No. Let me get my and stiff ass stupid plastic pants on. You know what I was, uh, last night in Santa Barbara, it was Halloween and there were some people walking around in costumes. I go, forget about the costume and what it is. Just what they're able to wear. Like a onesy right. Walking around with, with, with the comfortable slippers and they're comfortable. Like why can't they do that every night?

Speaker 3:          00:44:57       Maybe minus the, the, the costume part of it. But like every, I thought how many people are getting to walk the streets in a freedom? It's like walking. It's like swimming naked in a, in a bathtub, in a pool. Probably. They're just walking around like with all that, just comfortable shit. Right? Like right. Cause you were saying, why can't we just walk around and, yeah. Like why, oh, in a fanny pack. Yeah, but what would the type of pants you said? Oh, sweatpants. Yeah, like nothing's more comfortable in sweatpants. So thing at one point were giving up anything. We, we've developed the most comfortable pair of pants there is, but we choose to go well but that's so many. Gave me a pair of these slippers that are like kind of like borderline between slippers and a shoe. It's real close. I think they'll like uggs from man or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:45:44       The inside is all like golf fleecy it's comfortable, so comfortable. And so a friend of mine came over and uh, I put them on and I go, hey man, what's up? And he goes, what are you wearing? Fucking slippers is there, are they the crocs, the ones with the no, no, they weren't crocs. They're, they're like, they're like leather on the outside but they have like a lining and the lining is like, like fleece, like like lamb scan or whatever the hell did they have. There was like, what does that slipper, I was like, it's fucking shoe or something. But to him it was like, it was like he wears slippers bro. You're like, why are you wearing, what are you trying to have fucking your feet be all soft.

Speaker 3:          00:46:22       Weird is against something that feels good. Why you wearing slippers? He doesn't realize it. That's the thing he doesn't realize, but breaking it down. That's what he's saying. You're wearing something that's more comfortable than everybody else. You're wearing slippers anywhere in a fanny pack. I might even say the same thing, but at least I'm willing to. I'm not from that one. If I see someone wearing slippers, you know what? I'm gonna do goat. It's a great idea. It's a fucking wonderful idea. How about rod and I mean, I mean he, that's why, I mean I, I want to live to be the age where I can show up at the Improv in probably my pajamas. I took that for granted when I used to see him doing that. He would then you sort of wear pajamas and slippers. He would wait bathrobe on stage with nothing underneath it. I was working, this is when I was working. I wasn't, I, I saw him. I was getting paid. I didn't know what the marketing arena, I was working at great woods center for the performing arts when I was 19 and Rodney was there backstage. He didn't give a fuck. He had no underwear on, no clothes on, who were fucking bathrobe and everybody's like, it's caucus just fucking hanging out. He doesn't give a shit. Rodney's, Hey, what are you saying? What do you say back there? Just getting fired

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       up on weed and he would go onstage in his bathrobe and he fucking destroyed. There's the human, his bathrobe. That's how he would dress backstage. Paul's Bullshit. He didn't give a fuck. He didn't give a fuck man. He didn't want to wear anything but a bathrobe and so he would go on stage like that and he would feel so funny because he was fucking naked up there and it was half of the fun half the fun of the show. I never knew the bathrobe thing all it goes us the pajamas, but that's just beautiful. I'll never forget man. I was about, I guess I was probably 19 years old and I was in this back area where the performance go right before they go onstage and I got a glimpse of Rodney like pacing before he went on in his bathrobe and I wasn't even, I had no comedic aspirations back then whatsoever, like zero, but I always loved stand up comedy and so I remember looking in there and go to holy shit, that's fucking Rodney Dangerfield right there and he's in a bathrobe and then we, they would all tell me like the guys who were backstage, the security was doing back there, they were like, dude, his balls are hanging out and just party and he gives zero fucks.

Speaker 2:          00:48:33       He's like 70 or something. I don't know how he old, he was back then, but he had to be in his sixties like deep in the 60s he was still doing blow. He didn't give a fuck. He was a maniac. You know the way, the way, it's awesome.

Speaker 4:          00:48:46       The way to explain what it was like, explain what it was like to meet Rodney. I was trying to explain this. I think over the years. I think once when I was, uh, somebody in my family or something, I was like, it was very hard. But I think I, I can do a better job of it now, but like, you know how we'll never get to meet homer Simpson? He's a character and you're not going to get to meet Peter from the family. You know, you don't get to meet them. You get to meet Rodney. Like you don't, you're not supposed to get to meet him. He's so larger than life that it's hard. Yeah. I have seen other people that are on TV when I was younger and when I saw them in public, yes. I was like, Oh yeah, there's that person. But Rodney was different.

Speaker 4:          00:49:21       It was like, what the fuck that, that's real. Because he was such, you know, like a cartoon character, you know what I mean? In a good way. He was a, in the movies too, and he was like larger than life was disrespectful, but he was, he was, he was, he was, he was, it was, it was amazing. And then, and then he knew and they capitalized on it later with the suit and a red tie. And there you see this. Oh my God. So anything he said, I went once to see Bob Nelson opened up for him and he, it's not a great story, but it's all I've got. So any little piece that I happen to have anything, I'm with Rodney, I'm happy, you know? So I remember seeing him and being like, that was just weird. And then a Bob goes, hey, this is Todd. He's from Philly. And he goes, that's good. Philadelphia needs him. We laughed so hard, laugh so hard because it was funny. But later when he left, I went, what did that mean? I don't know. No one knew. It didn't matter what it meant. It was Rodney. And, and it's not like we were fake laughing. It was just him fucking be. And that funding to go, they pulled off. He needs him. It was funny.

Speaker 2:          00:50:21       I got a chance to see him alive then. And then several years later at the laugh, stop, uh, uh, laugh factory rather. I got to see him at the laugh factory on sunset a couple times there. Like when, like what year? I would say it was the 90s and how it wasn't 90 days. Did he go up and do it pretty tight set hazing. He was killer. Who's killed even back then. I mean he, he didn't go onstage and half acid, that's for sure. He was crushing. He was really fun and he was just chilling, hanging out. His wife was with him, attractive woman who was like, you know, 30 40 years younger than him. It'd be just looked like he was having a great fucking time. He rode that thing right into the fucking rocks. He took that boat and just whoa and wrote it right into the rocks.

Speaker 2:          00:51:06       And he's 70 years old and he's crushing onstage, partying, hanging out with a hot senorita. Jesus Christ. He was an animal. That's, that's, that's so much. I, you know, that's, when you look at it from that perspective, it's like, just amplifies what you're already know was like, yeah, fucking, he really did. He really do day or you know, I'm sure a lot of it's true, but the thing that most people know is like by the time he could enjoy it, he felt it was too late, but he still had a lot of fun. Right? Yeah. Oh, he had a great fucking time. Yeah, he was Rodney Dangerfield. He might as nice to people too. That was the other thing about Rodney. He helped comics out. His Hbo specials were legendary. Like a lot of people don't really even know like what a huge stand up he was.

Speaker 2:          00:51:51       He was a huge comedian, like great woods where I worked, where he performed, I mean I don't know how many thousands of people it is and it has to be at least like seven or 8,000 people in the, in the part that's covered. And then there's like this back like hill area that's like the grass, which is all like open wandering around. It was really crazy. Like what their idea was ridiculous because the idea was you would take these people and you and some of them would be seated in his beautiful amphitheater and then pass them. You would just stuff the grass, which is enormous patch of grass with savages who couldn't hear anybody who was talking on stage. So it was really unfortunate because like he needs what you saw him? Yeah, yeah. I got to see him close though. I heard it. But then I went to the grass because people were complaining.

Speaker 2:          00:52:38       They were coming down. They'd say, hey, we can't, we can't understand a fucking word. He's saying we've got tickets to the grass. And so I went out to the grass and I was like, oh no, you couldn't hear anything. It was this weird echoey thing. So when it would come out of the amphitheater, you had no idea what he's talking about. You'd hear people laugh and you'd go, Oh fuck, this is terrible. So will they like ripped all these people off? And so they, you know, the, unfortunately it didn't get a chance to see him, but he was in his prime and he was, this was, he was a really fucking, really funny guy. But his big thing was helping other Comedians, those Hbo Comedy Festivals Launched Kennison launched dice clay launched bill Hicks and, and you know what? I'm going to give him a huge compliment. And it's not like I'm complimenting myself cause I don't know if I, Hey, we only can live to, if I got to that point,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       if I did what Rodney didn't, but up to now I haven't. So I'm not doing it from a place of judgment. So it's nobody's job to come and help other comedians. So we, I'm not saying it from that point of view. No, no, no, no, no. I'm saying it's just sometimes you get someone that loves comedy so much that on their own they go, you know what, there's some people I know are fucking funny that, you know, back then it wasn't even TV. There wasn't a lot of avenues. So it was Rodney specials. They weren't getting on the tonight show. Some were did both, but a lot were like his vehicle. So no one, since Rodney has ever done that. No. No one. And if I'm wrong, I want to know. I don't want to be, you know, I'm not saying like if somebody looks something up and goes, this comedian did, I'd be like, well, they're cool too.

Speaker 1:          00:54:02       Martin Lawrence didn't, he didn't? No, no, no, no, no. Robert Townsend did a few of those. He did a few of those. Then you do a few of those where he brought up different comics like Damon Wayans. I remember did one then, then so, so I like that. That's a guy that kind of disappeared. Robert Townsend. You remember that guy? Yeah. Whatever happened to that guy. Yeah, that's a good question. He just sort of, I don't know what happened that day. He was really respected. It was hilarious. He was really funny. Did he do, what did he do? Um, it wasn't a Hollywood shuffle, was it? I don't know. I'm not good with movies. Yeah. I'm not eating them at home. Yeah. Robert Townsend. Oh my God. Yeah. He was hilarious, man. Whatever happened. I remember that special where he came at w what was the special where he came out and he was talking in the accent and then he, oh, he broke character after like a minute. I don't remember. That was on one of Rodney's maybe was it? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:54:54       but anyway, I hope that came out right. That's just very admirable that Rodney did that and you know what made it even more admirable because he was so big. It's not like he needed it. Certain comedians may have done it when they're at a point in their career when it needs them or they need it. Rodney didn't need that. He, I think he used his power to get a special and do something you wanted to do. I don't think he needed that. Like Rodney, they called you. They want you to host this. It was something he perpetuated the, he had sorta

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       past. That's why it was sorta cool. This is Robert towns right here is this Hollywood shuffle. Meteor man. Meteor man. He did a lot of really funny movies, man. And he was a funny comic too. Yeah. Yeah. What's he doing now? I don't know where is it? Maybe just said, you know what, I'm good. He's only 56 you knew also dresses like pretty much how they want on stage and almost every day is don Barris. He'll, he'll just wear like boxers and my jetpack. Yeah, well that's, that's the thing, you know, be uncomfortable. What do you wear on stage? Whatever I'm wearing, I'd like to wear something that's not too distracting. I like to wear something that's a comfortable just, I usually like to wear like I work, converse all stars pretty much every day. Once I started wearing those, I realize like if I wear a regular shoe now, like anything that has a heel, like a running shoe, it feels weird to be like in that different posture.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       You're not supposed to stand like that. I suppose stand flat and outside were like them because they're flat and comfortable. You feel as you're tilting forward you are. We just, I'm so, it's so rare for me. The only time I wear shoe shoes is want to do the UFC. Do you think? Do you think like even I know exactly what you're talking about because I've put the, I get used to it after a while, but there's a pair of boots and after I'm not wearing them for a while ago. What am I, what's the go forward here? So we're women do that. Do you think that, yes, I'm going to take from that to this, but I'm curious of your opinion on this. Do you think like for women wearing high heels it might hurt them more than they may be think cause it's a horrible thing to do to yourself?

Speaker 1:          00:56:52       I think it's probably, and it is really difficult to do every day. I think women who wear them everyday just to, to uh, their job. I like to wear high heels around the office constantly and that's all you were at work. Ooh, I got to think that's brutal and punishing on your feet. I got to think that. Yeah. I don't see how it couldn't be. Could you be doing, let me ask you this. Some people will go, could you be doing it just for yourself instead of putting it from, you know, so he could, I know I don't. You could be. Yeah, they could do it for other girls. There's, well, there's a misperception about women that everything they do is to attract men and as that's certainly has some merit to it, but it's not everything. They also do it to show up other girls like girls and, and to be like impressive to other girls.

Speaker 1:          00:57:33       Oh that's that Chinese thing, that foot binding thing that they do. Whoa. Where they smashed. They smashed their feet down. They want their feet to be small. People are so crazy. The size of the feet means so much to them buying their feet up into this crazy positions. Oh, that's so crazy at all the things that people do. That is one of the weirdest ones. All the body modification things that people do culturally, like really common body modifications. The foot binding one is so bizarre. Like really, really fucking weird. Yeah. That's not just respecting other cultures. That's, come on, that's a port. There's a problem. It's torture. There's something sane about it. Women in Africa that are, uh, the Suaree women who are the, I think it's Surrey where they make that, that big plate in their face. The young ones are rejecting it now they're going, fuck that.

Speaker 1:          00:58:24       This is crazy. Like I'm not wearing a fucking plate in my lip anymore. And like they're like, they're getting sorta like, uh, there's a cultural rift with the young ones don't want to knock their teeth out and where this plate you have to knock your lower teeth out to where those plates, it's fucking cool. You know, their knowledge cause the, cause we're in a computer age where they're give there. Yeah, that's, they're not even getting, I don't even think they're getting that much impact from the computer world and these like really remote tribes. I'm not sure I probably be wrong. I'm probably wrong. It's probably someone with a laptop and a fucking cellular connection that gets online or something when I got to feel like you're wearing it, you and me really super tribal environment. They've topless wearing skins and stuff. Like some of them it's like really crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:59:07       Like, how similar that the way they are living today as the way they were living like hundreds of thousands of years ago. What were we talking about? Right. But like just uh, leading up to this but the same thing. Um, body modifications. Foot binding. Oh yeah, the foot binding. Yeah. What I was thinking there's got to be one of your listeners could, could look this up for you guys or you could, there's gotta be someone that's living today that did that, but move past it in this world. There's got to be one that tells a story. Do your foot. I think once your foot's bound up your fox or did it, but then you're right. I'm sorry, did it and then tells the story like move past it mentally is a point going and that was what am I doing and how do you know people, I don't know how you would do that though.

Speaker 1:          00:59:46       Like can it be somebody is stuck like that forever? No, no one do your thought like explain the thought process. Well it's, I think it's just cultural conditioning. You know, there's, we have a we really weird problem as human beings that once a group of us start doing a thing, even if that thing is ultimately detrimental, once a group of us start doing it, people want to join in, it seems normal. We can rationalize because other ones are doing it. It's, it makes sense. That's how the lip thing gets started. They put this giant plate in your lip and the bigger the plate, the more cattle you're worth. What does that noise, do you hear that? You know what I thought it was, I thought you were bringing in like a sound effects. Yeah. It sounds like, is it an airplane? Yeah. Crash space shuttle. I'm sure. What, okay. Whatever. What was my point?

Speaker 1:          01:00:36       I was doing my ventriloquism. That's pretty good. Look what was my point? What was it like? Oh, we were talking about, um, um, oh, the, the modification, the foot binding saying all that stuff was really bizarre. Yeah. The, the uh, the foot binding, the lip thing, you know, it's, it's really bizarre that there's these cultures out there that are really still like super, super primitive. You know, to this day, apparently a lot of them were like really fucking happy and healthy though. That's the weird thing about these indigenous people. When you find them, you don't find a lot of like problems that a lot of people in the city have like psychological problems. It's very rare. It's very rare that people have like psychological issues while they're the winners. Right? I mean, seriously. Oh, if they're happy, I guess so, but I don't think it's impossible to be happy in this world.

Speaker 1:          01:01:22       I, you know, I think that there's a lot of people that don't get there, but I think it's possible. I think it's possible for anybody to be happy in this world. I think did this world though is insanely complex and it requires a much more rigid idea of what you're going to accept and not accept in your life and what what you're going to put out there and what you're going to try to get back now. I think that that's, it's very, very, very complex. This is an insanely intricate in woven society and these cultural tribes. That's really what we're designed for. We're designed for these, you know, these environments, these places where as you know, 500 of us that live in a village together. That's, that's what we're designed for psychologically. That's what our brains are designed for. When we, you jack it up to 7 billion people in contact with each other, it's going to require some adjustments and that's what we're going through right now.

Speaker 1:          01:02:13       It's not that they're, it's going to be impossible for people to be happy in this crazy day and age. It's just a little bit more to manage and it a, it brings you to this movie that I just watched. I was on a plane coming back from England and I watched a summertime in Paris. I think it's, that's what it is. Is that Woody Allen's moving? Was it summertime in Paris? Let me see if it's, it's the Owen Wilson movie. Well, that's what I was, what was really funny. He was doing woody Allen movie. Woody Allen movie. Come on. What's the movie? Springtime. Paris, forget your trouble. Who's, come on when you Google woody Allen in midnight in Paris. That's what it is. Midnight in Paris. Sorry. Not Summertime and, uh, it, it was hilarious in this weird, it was, well, it was a good movie first of all, but it was, what's it about? It's about a guy, um, it's basically a woody Allen movie. He's woody Allen. Owen Wilson's doing woody Allen like eve, his mannerisms, but he's not admitting it. No, no, no. He's not admitting it at all. He's like, is this a trailer for it? Is that one of those things that nobody will watch how he does it? Like what?

Speaker 5:          01:03:20       Yeah, he's so measured and even it's very woody Allen. Like, that's great. We can spend some time together,

Speaker 1:          01:03:35       a lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's, well, what,

Speaker 5:          01:03:39       yeah. Did you have your slippers on when you watch this? Oh, snake, that's worth, because I was blessed by his wife. He was never married to Ron Antisocial, quite as taken with him as you are. It's a pseudo in electrical, slightly more tannic than the 59. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:00       I don't remember what thinking you're right. And then I go, don't just say he's right to say he's right. Like Todd really pay attention. But that's, once you look for it, then you just see it. Every single joke he's doing what he, and he does it brilliantly. It's brilliant. He's really amazing. And this movie is that perfect? What would, would, would his contemporaries think he should just sort of give an homage to it or do you have to mention it? I don't know if you do, but that's what he's doing. I think what he wrote it for, it means to playing a character. Obviously he's not playing Owen Wilson. What do, yeah, what do you need to read it? Oh, he did woody Allen Film. He didn't know it was woody Allen did. And yes, it's a woody Allen film. So let me see if, what if I ran out crying?

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       I don't want to get a writer and director Woody Allen. It's so obviously woody Allen movie that basically, Oh, and him agreed that he would do it as woody Allen. So it's like he can't do those movies anymore, but he's got them in his head, you know, so what it but what he can really star and movies anymore. People don't want to see him anymore. That whole thing with his daughter, and this is just, it got so weird with so many people that regardless of whether they're happy or not, it's so tie boot taboo that they've sort of ostracized him. They allow him to be behind the scenes, but if he's in front of the camera, like people are really sketchy about it. Unfortunately or fortunately, what could this work for him and yes, we'll do it. You get on Wilson, do every fucking movie and do it as Woody Allen and woody on and can crank out a million fucking hits.

Speaker 1:          01:05:22       It would be amazing. I'm telling you, this movie did not get nearly as much credit, like it only got a 7.7 on the IMD be, I dunno if that's good or bad, but I thought it was a, it was a woody Allen movie and if you take again, some people are not willing to take away their feelings of him as an individual shields work. I don't know. I, I know there was some madness with him and his wife and the, you know, the Wyatt mentioned his wife. She, uh, well, you know, that woman makes it look like, what was her name? Woody Allen. Then Mia Farrow, Mia Farrow, and uh, he looked, man threw a cup of fucking Hollywood people. Who knows what the fuck the truth really is. There are a bunch of nutty people, but ultimately he wound up leaving with her adopted daughter. Yes, I know about that dance.

Speaker 1:          01:06:11       You know? That's crazy, man. I mean, he was with her from the time when she was like to, you know, don't try to be funny. You have an opinion about that. That's, that's fucked up. Yeah. I mean, I think they adopted her when she was a baby. She was, wasn't his biological daughter. So, you know, it's true. Obviously judgment, all the judgments, all the judgment is fine. But if it's not, what if he has a relationship with her kids with her? Oh No. You know, what am I saying it's true or not. If it's true, it's definitely true. That's right. That's right. It's the moral judgment. It's like if she became a woman and that's what she really wanted, and that's what he really wanted. Is that a bad thing? You know, everybody wants to decide that it is and I think you know ultimately that's the snap judgment and that's the one that I would take.

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       I would go, oh, he's a fucking creep. That's his daughter. I hate to say this, but when we're dealing with what you should and shouldn't be able to do and if ultimately this is what two adult people want to do, it sounds disgusting to me, but I don't feel like it's within my jurisdiction to tell adult people what they can and can't do together, whether it's a brother and sister. Her brother and sister are in their forties and they started decided to start fucking each other. Why do I care? The only, the only reason why I would care as if they decided to make children and it can be some harm to the children. Why is it a law against them fucking each other? I mean I don't, I don't want to do it to my sister. I love my sister. She's my sister. It would make me feel disgusting to have sex with her. I've never thought about it once. But if you do, what do I give a fuck can,

Speaker 4:          01:07:43       can I tell you why I don't care if I had to, like I call it gun to my head go, which way's better your way or the way we do it now? I always say go on that way because every time we evolve, we don't look past and may think we made any mistakes. And you know what I mean? Never went. You know the one group we were too fair to. Who knows? Like it just seems like it always, the story's going to be most likely everything you're saying. And like who knows what year there'll be like, there'll be some kid off to go wet. It used to be wrong to date. Your, your brother told be like, yeah, I mean years or they would the, you know, they'll tell the

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       story and she about who you fuck. Yeah, no to me. And it's funny than me. And you both need to say because it doesn't have, it doesn't have interesting introspect. If it's interesting to one of us to think of having sex with my brother fucking at the group. I don't get where I'm at by the, I get by. That's what everyone else does. They think, well, I wouldn't want to have sex with that person. So that was be gross. That's what people think of gay people. So I'm, am I turning around and doing that to another group right now? I don't know, but fuck it. I'm Aaron on your side and going leave everybody the fuck alone. I think as long as you're dealing with two sober adults, that's, you know, I got, whenever I'm high and I talk about stuff, I get nervous. That would be the one detail that I would look like an idiot if I go, wait, Todd, that was between this age and that age go, oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:08:57       No, I was thinking of consenting adults, consenting adults. Uh, yeah, 18 and over you, you know, mistakes are no mistakes. You're, you're certainly going to make them. You're responsible for a certain amount of your actions from a certain age on you. You should. You should. It should be very difficult to trick you. That's what we try to do. We tried to make it legal to fuck you when it's really difficult to trick you. Really, people should be able to fuck until they're 30 okay. It should be illegal to fucking under that standard. I'm petrified right now. I'm sorry I wasn't listening because I'm petrified to think. Did I just say that being gay was like fucking your brothers? No, I didn't say that right now. You said that that's how some people would feel about being gay, that you, you as a gay man, a repulsed by the idea of fucking your brother, but some people would think about that as gay sex.

Speaker 3:          01:09:50       You know, just just have a brother and sister. Make it brothers and sisters. No, it's a perfect analogy because why does anyone care what two people that are adults decide to do, whether it's two women or two men or for women and six men? Who cares if they are all in agreement and they all are consenting and everybody's sober and no one gets tricky because there's plenty of people making psychological mistakes by who they date it, whether it's so, whether even if it's cause it's a guy and a girl there. There's other, yeah, a million reasons. So this is one more, maybe you shouldn't do it. And why it's, I, I was sort of halfway knew I was going and then I got lost. Well, the idea of someone being able to tell someone else what they should enjoy, whether it's sex or music or anything, right.

Speaker 3:          01:10:32       Even if we write, if you're a person who likes getting your feet sucked, you love it and everybody else thinks it's fucking disgusting. If, if someone else like sucking feet and you two get together, that's awesome. You know, immediate might freak you out if that's your next door neighbor and you're like, hey, just sucks feed all the time. They go over the guy's house, his feet all over the wall and it's fucking feet phones. He's just a crazy flood soccer, you know, don't get no one. You know what I sort of, what I sort of get from what you're saying right now is that like, and it's good. I like to remind myself, I figured myself as lead everybody the fuck alone and don't judge everybody and just, I know they think as long as maybe I catch myself doing, oh, of course you can have limitations where you can say there's obviously that's a two consenting fucking adults. But maybe even though I think I'm open minded, you're right like that, you know, why would make judgment on someone you're right. Maybe or make stupid jokes like that to what you were just talking about. The foot sucky, but what, why the fuck I don't want to be that person. Yeah. He likes feet. Somebody black stocking feet. I don't want to be the person who goes, hey, you know that guy.

Speaker 3:          01:11:42       Yeah, it's weird. We all do it. I think we do it also because we're insecure and because it's also not even necessarily, and it's, it's, it's a jump reaction that people have to something that's very different from them. And guess what? If you found it out and I'm saying maybe someone hearing this would be like, you know what? I might do that, but now I'm not going to, here's what it is like you don't want to be that person that goes, hey, you know that guy for no reason at all and found that out about that person. Two years later you're still going. Yeah, he's a good guy. He likes slugging feed. How do you know how some picture got published and you don't? Why would you want to prepare? Why do you have to keep telling everybody that? Why do you now look, I don't like sucking feet and I don't want everyone to get nervous.

Speaker 3:          01:12:20       Your me. Oh, that's a joke. I was doing a sketch feet and a sketch schedule, like if you had a picture that was an old SNL audition that I used to make my own tapes was this thing I used to do. That's hilarious. So funny. Jesus, I'm leaving. I'm going to leave. I'm going to, I'm going to leave it more people alone. That's all I want to do. That just saying it's fine. You're not alienating anybody with foot soccer's. Oh yeah. That, I know. It's a small segment and you don't have to worry. They could laugh at it. That's my rule. Like I think I tried it here to that, like someone that did suck feet could listen to this, you know? Yeah. And laugh. Yeah. I don't think they're going to be offended. I think we're pretty much giving them the green light. Thank you for giving everybody the green light is that you're not hurting anybody else, but it's one of those things where like, have you ever told someone that you like a certain thing and they go, oh, that fucking sucks, but it doesn't suck to me.

Speaker 3:          01:13:07       Do you know? I like it. I actually do like it. I like this band. I liked that. And like food. Yeah. It's like so many things that were comfortable to talk about that we don't like. No one has to be lie. They like Italian food, but some areas it's like you have like Kimchi, get the fuck outta here. You like Kimchi, they'll get mad at you. You like Kimchi. I'm like, go. I buy it. I like it. It's delicious. Leave me alone. No, I mean like fuck is wrong with you bro. You're eating Kimchi over there. It would never do that if someone goes, you got to read you like a red car. People live. Yeah. Yeah, like different. Red is a little tricky, right? It's a little douchey. Why? I don't have a red car. A red sports car. Almost got one. Did he never had a red car?

Speaker 3:          01:13:50       What color is your car? Just getting a red core colors. Your car. I silly. I get silly. What color is white? What kind of car? It's a Porsche. And is it a of Kuwait? I wouldn't even ask. I was going to say, is it a four door? No, no, no, but they make those now. I know. I know. Here's the, here's the thing. I thought like, you know how when you don't know? I don't know. Like it seems to be, it was one person I knew that likes Porsches were like, no, that's not cool. And then I thought, Oh, do people think they're not cool but not knowing. When I just saw one, I was like, fog, like I don't even not, it's not the type of car usually like just looked like a cool sedan. I didn't know it was a portion until I looked. There's a problem

Speaker 2:          01:14:26       people have with a rich people, items like that and that they automatically dismiss them as being a douchey thing to have because so many douchey people on them, but the reality is what they are is marvels of engineering. There are these amazing creations by these geniuses and artisans. I mean, to me that's what it is. It's an expression of art. It's geometric art, it's functional mechanical art. They figured out how to make this exciting, exhilarating thing that performs in a way that other cars don't and it looks great. It's like a cool, sleek, like I liked the way they designed it. I think it's a beautiful piece of engineering.

Speaker 3:          01:15:00       No, it's funny you mentioned that because there's something I'd probably do like I sometimes, like we've talked about on the show that I wouldn't want to pull up. There's a lot of cars where I do my show. I looked down on these cars. Oh, there's so many that I fucking love. Like I could just, I get it to sightlines. I'm more of an SUV guy I think, but I can look at so many of those, but I wouldn't drive onto the Improv because I've said this on my show. I go because I don't know you, but what the fuck? Why? Why? That's like doing exactly the opposite of what I preached to do. It's like an eye prejudge. I do. I prejudge instead of, but, but I know that's person might drive it up for the same reason that I sit upstairs and look down at the cars and go, fuck, look at that one.

Speaker 3:          01:15:40       Look at that. We go over and we touch in the paint feels different therapy, but yet I would be afraid to do it. Well maybe you shouldn't be the Mar. I'm going to buy a Dune buggy. But if that's the car that's one of those crazy VW bugs and has like the extra wide fender flares, engine exposed, drive around with that convertible. It's the one I like crazy. Joe Rogan told me it's all right. It's painted whatever fucking color. You're like a bubble machine. I've gotten out of it. Could Joe Rogan. It's a inside of it. It's constantly blowing bubbles. Little sound.

Speaker 3:          01:16:17       Todd glass ladies and gentleman pulled up to his spot when Todd told me, you know, this is you going when? When Todd told me he, I appreciate car. I thought he meant like an old Porsche. I didn't know he's going to get that. He's blaming me. I mean, yes technically, but Dune buggy with a full roll cage I wanted, I was so jealous in my neighborhood when someone had a dune buggy. This guy's got a dune buggy. The bottom of the ocean. Is that what this is? Beetle a beetle cage car where they can drive around on the bottom of the ocean. Oh, that's hilarious. Cade says sharkskin kidding. That's incredible. Oh my God. What a genius idea would have a little shark swims in their bites. You right in the Dick and is playing a holes and that fucking thing. They're crazy. Yeah, there I wouldn't need weapons and Kevlar. What do you do? I have, I've, you know, the whole seaworld thing that's going on that hate it. Have you,

Speaker 2:          01:17:08       I hate the idea.

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       I've spent too much time paying attention to killer whales and dolphins and reading about them. I hate it. Let me ask you a question. It's Pr, it's slavery. It's slavery to an alien animal that we don't understand. What do you do with people that like if they can look, there's some things I do that make me hypocritical and I'm asking you to help me fight the fight. What do you do with this? Because you know someone would go, what about, so I agree with the, I agree 100% it's like no, come on. Like, well, the way we will treat them as the way we treat each other, it's more than that. Even if it's just not that it has to do with it, but it does. Even if it ended right there and that animal's pain and it didn't affect the way those humans that can do that, treat other people on that alone.

Speaker 4:          01:17:49       It's wrong. But don't think your for a second that that's not also if you have the ability to do that, you're not bringing home a good energy to your kids. Those people that fucking do that, they go home to children, they pass that there's something vial and unaware of a human thing to slug it in. Now what do I do with people that go, you eat meat and that's the way it's what I've set up till now is this. I go, I don't want to be a smoker that smokes and because I can't quit, I want to be the smoker. I was, I used to smoke and while I smoked it, but this is such this, I knew it was violent, disgusting. I didn't think why don't have the ability to quit. So I'll make pretend to give a public outward thing of going, ah, you know you're going to have, you can, you can eat a candy bar to not, you know, you know there's people that write it off because they can't quit.

Speaker 4:          01:18:30       I just called the vial and that led to me quitting one day. Right? So I want to do the same thing with the meat just because I'm lazy or whatever it is right now, and I might be partaking in some of that slaughtering the way I eat every day. It doesn't negate that I know it's wrong. And Sea world thing like come on. How can someone think that's okay with Joe and some of your listeners, you know, might disagree with us. Just like the seaworld thing. You just, when you hear the facts and the size and you get it, it's a bath tub and that they take, so take away from his family and all that. What listening person right now, and I mean that wholeheartedly is sitting home going, oh, it's seaworld. Come on now. You're being ridiculous.

Speaker 2:          01:19:07       Worse than prison. Okay. Because it's being imprisoned by an alien species present. At least you could talk to the guards. It's, it's an insane relationship that they have those killer whales have with those trainers and it's, it's atrocious. The idea is insane. They are incredibly intelligent. They have a very complex language that we can't decipher. They have different accents for different regions. They recognize each other. They have very tight knit colonies. He stayed together forever. We just can't appreciate the way they live their life. But their world is a magical wonderland where they're the top dog of the sea. They kill sharks, man. They got their name killer whale because they kill whales, they kill small whales. They'll go up to like a a humpback whale, have a child and they'll tear it apart is, I watched a horrible video of it the other day with these, I mean we like to think of Orcas as being these like really sweet things that jumped for fish.

Speaker 2:          01:19:58       They're murderous machines when they're out there in the wild. They killed dolphins on a regular basis. But for them, that's the spoils of the real world. That's how they to the top of the food chain by being these ruthless superintelligent motherfuckers that live in this playground of the ocean and they cheat, they migrate up and down the coast and they've done so for thousands and thousands of years until this fucking tiny blip in time. This industrialized age, this age of aquariums is age where they figured out how to capture those fucking things. And stuff them into fucking swimming pools. It is slavery. It should be highly illegal. The people that want to do it, it should. It should without a doubt. They should tax them out of fucking business. There should be no way. You should be able to profit off taking a thing and making it do tricks.

Speaker 2:          01:20:48       And when you find out how they train them and you hear the things they do, they isolate them and put them in small tanks they put there. It's way crazier than putting a person in solitary confinement. They have them all stuffed together physically. They can't fucking move. They wind up biting each other and aggravation. It's slavery. It's just slavery of a nonhuman, but equal level intelligence. We have this idea that just because they can't alter their environment with their fingers, that they're not super intelligent, but that's our own biases. They're insanely intelligent. In fact, their cerebral cortex is something like 40% larger than a human beings that we don't know what the fuck they're going, what's going on in their mind, but they're absolutely aware that what we're doing to them is not what they want. They want to be fucking free and just because he charged money say, well it's going to go to conservation. You know what else would go to conservation awareness? Let people know what a magical animals and the people will donate.

Speaker 4:          01:21:42       By the way, whenever I hear more on podcast where we'll ask those type of questions, I go, who? I always go if I had a show and people go, you do have a show. I go, yeah, but I mean it got near the people that I want to ask the questions. How come nobody has told them yet? And better way than I could tell as this, but no one I've never asked. So one interviewer, when they're interviewing these people that say, well we give a lot of money, would you be able to molest a group of children but then give $7 million a year to the cause of molestation to, cause it's not a race it no, it's like they actually through such as like doctor Phil calls a paper argument. Like you're, you're making an argument that's not really being had. Like you're trying to act like the argument is why do you give money to,

Speaker 2:          01:22:18       that's the argument also for hunting. You know the argument for hunting is that when you hunt you the hunters pay for tags and those tags pay for conservation. And in fact hunters do like better. They, there's more money that comes to conservation for preserving animals that come from hunting than I think almost any other source is hunting bad. No, no. Not only is it not bad, it's important, right. That's what I thought. That's what I miss the levels of the car. If you've ever been on a road and like Wisconsin or some shit like that, like late at night, you have to manage that. Like people are gonna die. Like unless you introduced predators into the environment, unless you introduce wolves, which is equally dangerous, you know, and we're starting to see the results of that. There's people that are getting attacked by wolves. A guy was a hunting with his friend and they had a fight off the fucking wolf pack is really recently and there they were trying to fight over an elk carcass and it becomes a real issue and they dominate areas and they don't take kindly to some new hunter coming in.

Speaker 2:          01:23:14       There's a video I put up on Twitter. Um, guy runs into wolves while elk hunting. I put it up a while ago. Just look up on Youtube, uh, ran into wolves while l cog, elk hunting. And there's this, I'm always fucking crazy video. These dudes, elk hunting in these wolves are around them circling them how old and shit. It's fucking eerie. And they're like, oh shit. But they have guns. They're not freaking out too much, but they're like, oh shit, this is crazy. Like the wolves, like following them, looking around at them. Like they would here one over there and then would one would run through the woods in front of them. It was really fucking weird. Uh, coyotes, uh, that's what we see in Los Angeles. Or is it wolf? When I see a coyote on my street, if it, if it, if it's anywhere near my house, like especially in front of my house, uh, I will rather, if I had the money, I would go check into a hotel because I'm always afraid when I get out of the car, they're going to be lurking out of every tree around my house.

Speaker 2:          01:24:08       So it's like, I just pictured that I get creeped and I though I bolt from my house to my front door. You should, they give me the boat. I just got bitten Colorado. A guy got attacked by coyotes at a bus stop. I liked the [inaudible] wolf hunting surrounded by wolves with a bow. That's a, this is the, it's the first one. You know, I see this Brian w w wolf hunting. Yeah. Listen to the fucking sounds. These things are making these guys, uh, we're out there hunting and the wolves started circling them and finding out where they were and like communicating with each other. They like, one of them would pop out and they were like staring at the dude's and then they would go back into the forest and another one will come from a different direction. They're all making these crazy noises, man. It's really fucking bad ass. They're hungry enough, right? Oh, they'll kill you for sure if they think they get away with it, but they, they're very aware of these dudes. And so they're, they're letting these dudes, no,

Speaker 6:          01:25:01       first one was white. It wasn't, but they have their guns.

Speaker 2:          01:25:04       How about now? They have bows and arrows. How different are they from the sketchy? Dangerous. Jody's much, much, much bigger. Much bigger. Much stronger. Much scarier. Much smarter. They eat coyotes all the time. Like goldfish. No, no, no, no, no, no. Coyotes are sneaky Fox man. They're very sneaky. And they figured out how to get over over fences and shit. Coyotes figure out a lot of ways to, uh, to get into your, they get into my yard, man. They got it into my yard. And I have a, I have a high plans at the big one. Yeah. So he's a blowing an elk horn to try to get them to come over. And that might've been what they responded to in the first place. They blow these horns, that sounds, they have two different ones. One of them that sounds like a male elk, which is kind of scary. And another one that sounds like a female or a baby. And that's what brings the wolves around.

Speaker 6:          01:25:49       Sure.

Speaker 2:          01:25:52       These guys are going to soon have wolves around them. They have holes around him right now or they do it. They're making these, there's still, these fucking assholes are still making these calls cause their elk hunting, they're looking to get an elk, but they're not going to get elk right now because there's wolves everywhere. There's a thing going on right now in part of the country where they've reintroduced wolves because the wolf population had been decimated. So they reintroduced walls button. They used a larger Canadian wolf to like, uh, you know, that's like using Germans instead of pygmies. You know what I mean? Like their bosses, wolves. But one of them's mother fucker. That gets to be about 200 pounds. And so these things, these big ass wolves have been decimating these elk populations. So that's your options. If hunting, if you don't want hunting, you have to bring in wolves. I'd say we're probably safer with the hunting.

Speaker 4:          01:26:39       No, I always knew. Matter of fact, I was surprised because I always thought I couldn't hunt myself, but I always knew that, that I had thought that that was always a good way to like that's a, that's an honest and animal has a life. It doesn't suffer. I know I couldn't. They get killed. But you're talking about in the plants where an animal is whole life, the dates killed is the best day it's life.

Speaker 2:          01:26:58       And not only that, the, yeah, the life is absolutely, you know, absolutely wild as nature intended, nothing changes until that one moment you get shot. Right. So it is the freest of free range possible. And a lot of times they've never even seen a person before. And a lot of times also you're dealing with environments. Especially, I went hunting in Montana and they lose a giant amount every year. Just they freeze to death, they get killed by predators. They freeze to death or they get lame and if they get lame, that get killed by predators. I mean there's a lot of different predators in that area. And we found mountain line shit and it was a log of mountain line shit and was filled with hair. So it was a deer hair. So they, that's how they get that go. They use the freeze to death of the killed by mountain lions. They're not gonna make it. No one makes it, no one, no deer die of old age. It doesn't happen. It doesn't exist. So it's just a matter of who kills them, whether it's a Predator or whether it's a human. This fucking thing is dying computers in a horrible way.

Speaker 4:          01:27:50       Do you know what? I didn't realize what you just said until, I don't remember what year it was, but it was in my adult life. Like I always had this visualize, visualize an animal, a certain age, you know, they grow. Go what you just said, I sorta realized once and I went, oh, they didn't do any. I mean statistically do any, no, it makes it makes you maybe elephants the so just, and I don't know if you know the, you know, just get me in the right area. I'll be happy. Like, so let's say you're a, I want to, I don't want to pick an animal too far up. How long's the deer live?

Speaker 2:          01:28:22       Oh, if it's lucky, it gets five years then it's got to be really lucky though. Oh really? Lucky. Super Lucky. And then as it gets like six and seven, they get old and haggard and then something takes him out. Either they break a leg, hop a fence, and they freeze to death. That happens all the time. All the time. Especially northern areas or predators get them. If they break a leg in California, they're not going to freeze to death. But you know, they'll probably get killed by something that comes along and finds them.

Speaker 4:          01:28:46       You know how they say, if it's Cliche, it's true. Nature can be cruel. As you're talking, as you're talking, I'm like, half of this I'd never even would think of, I was like, forgot about the, they get old, they fall over. It's like nature can be fucking cruel. Well, not only that, there's also amount of limited

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       food supply depending upon the area. That's one of the things that conservationists do best. Um, and uh, including these, um, game wardens and other, the fish and game, they figure out how much land there is, how much food there is, how many animals can be sustained, and then what is the population? And then they release tags based on those estimates. So it's the whole idea behind it is managing populations and they pull the pull hunting back if there's any sort of a problem, if there's any, if the species are being extinct. In fact, like big horn sheep, um, when we were in Montana, these fucking things are everywhere. Everywhere you went hunting for deer. But when we were there, we saw more sheep than we saw deer. But it's really hard to get a sheep tag to kill a sheep even though there's a lot of them because they're trying to build up the population because they were decimated at one point in time.

Speaker 1:          01:29:51       There was also, um, there's, there's wolves there as well. Montana wolves. There's, see there's coyotes, there's mountain lions, there's plenty of predators out there. So they didn't necessarily need humans to take care of this population. They want to build it up to a substantial size. You see that in Nevada as well. What, what's the most amount? Sounds like a weird question, but what's the most amount of animals you've, you know, I mean like what you could say 50 or a hundred running together in nature? No Elk. You can see hundreds. Have you? No, I've never seen it. But in Colorado there's a town called evergreen and we were visiting and there's this area of evergreen is where this main street is. And they have a photo, I think it's on their web street, their website. What's the most you've ever seen? Uh, I, I've seen several like deer together, like four and five deer together.

Speaker 1:          01:30:38       I think probably the most I've ever seen. I've seen, um, many times I've seen a moose I've seen from five moose total, you know, but not more than two together. I've never seen a moose. Yeah, I'm talking about it the other night and we were saying, I swear to God, we were what we were talking about the Moose, how we, we, we thinking are we thinking of the cartoon Moose? Are we actually thinking of the Real Mousse? And we decided that no, even the real loose, it's got some crazy characters. Yeah. Like the, you know what I mean? Obviously they amplify it, but even the route, so we pulled one up online. I was like, Oh yeah, that looks like something that shouldn't be real. That's what I thought. But someone told me that the nose, the length of the nose. Did you tell me this?

Speaker 1:          01:31:18       No, the length of the nose is, uh, because it, it warms the air up before it gets to the brain because you're dealing with something that's so fucking cold. The air is so fucking cold that they have to have this long. No. So as they breathe in the air, it gets heated up slowly along the way before it gets to their head because they're dealing with like 50 below zero weather. They don't hibernate. I forgot about that. We're doing moose where they ask, they're living in Alaska. No, they live in Montana too. In Colorado. Uh, where I was, uh, someone, someone had moose droppings that they had discovered. So they, they get into Colorado. There's this moose in several states, but in Alaska they're really plentiful. I wonder if, because you know, I mean, keep in mind like, you know that lot of people aren't that bright, you know, a lot are, but some aren't.

Speaker 1:          01:32:01       So these are the ones I'm talking about. Like how many, I don't want. If Moose killings, when people, people would see them would be higher than other animals because dumb people go, oh, it's a moose and not getting, it's a row. She's animal. Would people ever get to be near Mousses? Yeah. People die in Moose attacks all the time. Is that true? Oh, so maybe I'm right. Someone died recently in Anchorage on the school campus. I think a moose got in and killed somebody. They panic and they'll stomp you to death if they're with their baby. All I'm thinking of is the happy Moose and I can't imagine them in a fit of rage. Well, twice we stumbled upon, um, Moose that had a child and we were super careful about it. They're cute. Jesus, the child is big, like a fucking great Dane already.

Speaker 1:          01:32:42       And we know it's boring. Yeah, I think the size of a great deal, but it was, when we saw it, it was a, it was obviously a baby, but it was still, it was a big fucking animal, you know, even though it was a baby, but the mother was huge. The mother was absolutely massive and she just locked eyes with us. They're pretty acclimated to human beings and they're, they're pretty sure of when people are dangerous and when they're not. But they also know that this occasionally a bang sound that comes from people and then one of their friends disappears. Like they're aware. They're not sure what the fuck is going on, but there were a fucking people, you know, like if you're, if you're ever in a place that has like a lot of hunting pressure, the deer are super skiddish. But when you're in boulder, Colorado, when you drive it around deer just chilling on the corner, like as the cars are going back and forth, is it 10 point buck just chilling in the corner eating grass from cars.

Speaker 1:          01:33:29       You're fucking flying around all around them. They don't give a fuck cause there's zero pressure from hunters and they start you. Yeah, like they acclimate, right, right. Boulder is crazy because I've never seen a place like that. I got out with my kids and you know, I made sure that I stood in front of them if the deer got really sketchy. But usually they run away. They're not, they don't try to be aggressive. And the males especially, except when they're looking for girls, that's when they could be dangerous towards the winter, uh, towards the, like the fall of the Rut when they start getting really horny. If you cock block a deer, they'll fuck you up. I would, I, I'm scared. You know, I'm the biggest chicken of, and I'm not, like, if I could drive in the car, I would appreciate it. But yeah. So I'm not, I would be near it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:08       I'm scared, you know, when we should be. It's just, that's a healthy intelligence is what it is. Every time I see a picture up there and I don't like it, it makes me paranoid of yourself. Yeah. Okay, let's take it down. No, that's okay. Why don't we don't need it. It's just a distraction. News cast or hair. Yeah. We can just shut it off, right? No, I don't, I don't know. Logo on or something. I don't want to freak you out. Oh, it doesn't the audience see this? No, the audience he's in no matter what. We just don't have to. Okay. See, there you go. Yeah. Now, um, what were we just saying about the, um, about the Oh yeah, so when I go to, uh, you know, DC where there's a lot of monuments and the squirrels are used to people. Yeah, yeah. Like that. Like, if I see a score from a distance, by the way, you know there's no more squirrels in Lake Arrowhead. What? Isn't that weird? What do you mean it? I almost, when somebody said it, I went, there's maybe less,

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       I don't know, more squirrels and then I have somebody, there was something that happened about five years ago or seven years ago with some disease that was up there. West Nile type. I think that's what it was. I'm not positive, but it's the only thing like, you know, when we hear about like for me, you know, I always just hear about, you know, like you just said, when they're trying to save certain animals, they cut off the hunting in certain areas or we're trying not to kill whales or you know, all that. But it was such a, to see an example of it to go after I realized that I would start noticing, I go, no, their score, maybe there's less, no squirrels. Whoa. It just not exist. Like that shows you like the magnitude of like just fuck. And that's what happens to other animals.

Speaker 4:          01:35:38       Just don't notice it. Oh from a distance. They're so cute. My mom had a squirrel, but she knew that when it was at a certain age, he had to let it go. She's like smart enough, she's not going to be one of those people with an animal that belongs in nature. But she nursed it back to health. She founded in her garage and then she just let it on her patio, but it wouldn't go anywhere and it would just stay there. And you know, uh, I forget what happened every time I've told this story two times and each time I forget what happened. But um, she had it for a long time. Oh, she gave it to a friend. She, she couldn't, it wouldn't leave her house and she couldn't take it anymore. Wow. Became the Mama and then the same thing. Yeah. And then after that, I don't know what happened. I got hit by a bus. Oh, just kidding. Why would I forget that

Speaker 2:          01:36:20       friends with wild animals though when you take them in, is that the, to reintroduce him back to the wild, the super difficult. They grew up getting food for free. Like now. They got to go look for it.

Speaker 4:          01:36:30       Yeah, that's why it is. It is. Yeah. You don't, well, I don't know what you should do. Squirrels.

Speaker 2:          01:36:34       Vegans of the rodent world. Oh, they don't eat meat. No, they nuts. That's why they're so sweet. That's why you don't have to worry about them like that. That's those cons. Theat everything there. He fucking shit. Elite condoms. They'll eat your deck,

Speaker 4:          01:36:46       Daddy. Whatever's in front of them. Rats are assholes to me. What you just gave legitimacy. Now look, if I see any road in, I get a little freaked out, but when I see a rat in New York City, here's what I think of their belly filled with trash they found was Phil look dead rats. Oh, they lead other routes. Oh

Speaker 2:          01:37:03       fuck yeah, they will. They will be wrapped in Encino. I lived in Encino and I had a rat in my garage, a little rat problem. I put my garbage in my garage before I would put it outside. And these rats, this apartment, those hills up there and then see, no, they are infested with rats. And this fucking giant rat got killed in a trap. I mean, it was fucking huge. It was as big as this thermostat's thermostats about the body of the Thermostat is about 12 inches long. It was a huge rash, rat, splat everywhere it was. It got, I get it. You know, I had a big ass rat trap, but it just smashed his head and killed him. But it was so big that I went out there. I was like, whoa. I was kind of freaked out. Well, I said, I'll clean that up in the morning.

Speaker 2:          01:37:41       I was a bachelor, you know, Lazy Bitch. I shut the light off. I shut the door, I go to bed, I get up in the morning and it's gone. The only thing that's left is its tail. They didn't need the tail. They ate everything else. They ate the whole rat. They found out. They felt that they'd frown. I was fresh meat. There was their buddy and they were like, good, this guy was a dick anyway, let's eat. And they ate them. And that's why rats are scary. Rats don't even wait for you to be cold before they eat you. If you're their friend, they cannibalize like on the Nache. It's normal. That's how you get bought. There's no like stigma about why. What are you doing? It's just a squirrel. Oh

Speaker 3:          01:38:16       it's this girl puts at a golf game the other day, took a squirrel out of the another guy's pants and then put in a tiger was like, why does the guy have a scroll scrolling his pants? You're like, just get an escort. And then I thought he was pretty nice about it. But you get the fucking squirrel of my best friends. His girlfriend isn't as girlfriend girlfriend, I think that's his girlfriend. She's a scroll lover. What can you tell? What can you say?

Speaker 2:          01:38:39       Yeah, they've exceptable rodent. You know what I mean? You can have a pet rat. Don't get me wrong. Guinea pigs are a little sketchy, but squirrels like, oh, they're free and wild. But yeah, their joke. You did. The only rodents we see in the wild, we go, aw, he's so cute. Which one swirls. We have this attitude about them. We have this APP will chips.

Speaker 3:          01:38:57       Thank God they got their tail. She mocks or actually even cute or adorable. When I was in boulder, there was a lot of chipmunks out there and we don't get the first step by that either. No, we don't get into it. And again, same thing. But did they eat the same thing? Rats. Yeah. They, no, no, no, no. The chipmunks are like, they're eating nuts. Nuts. The leaves of sugar. The rats. Or maybe they're just because they maybe if they wouldn't eat so much trash, we wouldn't, maybe we should tell them stop eating trash and people won't be as scared of you.

Speaker 2:          01:39:19       Well, they carry diseases too. They absolutely carry diseases. They carry rabies. It wasn't, didn't rats have something to do with the black plague? Didn't. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:39:26       Research that once. I don't think I could. I know I couldn't. That's the thing. I couldn't, if I, if I set a rat trap, I could never go near it. I'm like biggest chicken in the world, but that stuff and I hate it. Like I hate it. Like one time I saw a bird flying to a pool at a house I was house I was living in when I first moved to La and uh, it, it jumped, it got into the water and I could have run out and save it and like fucking Clinton, it was a bird. I could have reached in and gotten it and I couldn't. So I was like, yell for somebody else. I'm like, Hey, come on down to the pool. There's the bird just flew into the pool and the dot because it was too scared shitless to go over and touch the bird. Other people walk over at scoop it up. Like, you can't hate that about,

Speaker 2:          01:40:09       you should go to what you should volunteer for. Like a petting zoo. Get over that shit. Well, no, I'd go to the petting zoo animals. There's so numb and you need to hang out with like, well, he's dead. I was going to say

Speaker 3:          01:40:20       crocodile hunter. No, I don't want to get back, but I liked it may not be screwed. So

Speaker 2:          01:40:25       listen to this, the black death, which is the w, this is the, the rat disease killed an estimated 75 to 200 million people and peeking in Europe through the years. 1348 to 1350. Although there was several competing theories as to the, that's a lot. I ediology at e I, T I o l. O. G y Mellon. When I say that one of the black death analysis of DNA from the victims of northern and southern Europe, published in 2010 and 11 indicates that the pathogen responsible, blah, blah, blah, year, uh, pursuing bacteria and blah, blah, blah, blah. Had somebody do a rats spread through rats. I'm trying to figure out what, Oh, here it is. Okay. It was carried from fleas actually that lived in the rats, oriental rat fleas that were living on black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships. So it's spread throughout the Mediterranean in Europe. That's why they were so scared of rats and black death decimated to kill. Ready for this 30 to 60 60% of Europe's total population that time.

Speaker 3:          01:41:33       So there's a reason they have this reputation shoot, some of it on a fairly though

Speaker 2:          01:41:37       percent of their total population. You imagine if something came along and wiped out six out of 10 of all of us,

Speaker 3:          01:41:46       I think it should have a mean or reputation than it does. Oh my God. You know what I mean? You know you're a rat. It's not that bad. It should mean despicable. It should be very bad. Not just [inaudible]. Yes, thank you. Should not just be told on somebody. Yeah, you right. Well, I think that's like, you know, listen to this.

Speaker 2:          01:42:03       All in all the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350 million in the 14th century. [inaudible] this 14th century, so 13 hundreds so it killed. That's insane, man. It killed 100 million people at least.

Speaker 5:          01:42:22       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:42:23       75 to 200 million people. That's insane. So hard for me to even think about those years. And apparently it lasted forever. I mean, they, they couldn't cure things back then. It just would last for years and years and years and years and years. People kept dying of these horrible fucking diseases and some people would barely get through it and their main immune systems would strengthen and some people would just fucking drop off like flies.

Speaker 3:          01:42:48       Did you know the washing of the, you know your hands and everything was sort of not agreed upon by everybody. At first I babies for giving birth, they didn't even surgery wash their hands and it was almost like the people that wash their hands. That's why I'm saying Joe, everything leads down to the same thing just because people didn't do it. Like there's those things today. Don't be on the wrong side because every time in history it looks stupid. There was a group of people to argue with him over washing your hands. Well yeah, there's that thing going on today, so err on the right side of it or the story's going to be about what a moron you work

Speaker 2:          01:43:17       well. This is a word, weird denial about global warming. The, to me is absolutely fascinating because it's really one of the few arguments that have anything to do with nature and the nature of the world that have these ideologies attached to it. Liberal ideologies and conservative ideologies battling it out and when I hear conservative people say that it hasn't been proven that humans are responsible for global warming or that it's just a cycle of life are oftentimes I talked to them about it and they aren't even paying attention. The actual effects of global warming, they have this vague idea of what the impact of global warming is. Their main concern is defending conservative business practices and conservative ideologies and that's like where they go to immediately to strengthened up the gate and battle down for argument and it's the, okay, well who the fuck knows who's doing it?

Speaker 2:          01:44:12       Look at what's happening. How much do you know about what's happening? And that's when you, it's minuscule. These people have very little idea. For the most part, people are like really passionate about the subject. I'm sure there's a few experts out there that disagree with be right now, but I'm just saying that by Mike personal experience, a lot of people that I meet, and I don't have an opinion on it because I'm not a fucking climate scientist, but I've talked to like 25 year old guys, you know, they're like, you know, hard asses and they're like, look, fucking Earth's temperature has been trained in for, you know, a million years. It goes up and down. The dinosaurs lived in a totally different, okay, that doesn't matter. You know what else we know then? We know that used to be an ice age to do, you know that you know, that half of North America was under like a mile high sheet of ice. But what we do know is it's happening right now for sure.

Speaker 4:          01:44:53       Well, but let me ask, and this might be a no shit type of a thing, isn't the argument you would think on the, on the people that think let's uh, let's, uh, do what we need to do to do whatever we can do isn't what you should do the same whether you believe in we could change it or whether you can't, let's say you think you can't change it. We can't fix it. You would still want to respect the planet while we're here so you can not believe in it and still like I don't understand what the argument is to not acknowledge because isn't the whole fight to like try to be more aware of how much gas we use and right. Isn't that the ultimate goal to prove that it's happening? Does that make any sense to me? Totally. Me. I thought we were trying to prove let's use less because look, the global warming is our way of proving it may be making people believe it. So that's where I'm confused is so even if it's not, even if we can't reverse it, what's the downside of doing everything they say to do? Does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          01:45:44       How does that businesses would have to change some of their parameters like car businesses, you know, what did they do if they have coal burning plants, what do they do? Like this is what real problems in parts of China that the pollution has gotten so bad from coal burning that they literally can't go outside. There was this insane video that they, that was on TV the other day. Uh, let me, let me pull this up. Smog in China. It's a, it's fucking nuts, man. These people are walking down the street and they, they have their, their faces covered with like masks and stuff and they're trudging through and it looks like they're in an apocalypse movie. I mean, it's worse than the road, you know, the gloomy look, that mood, the road, this gloomy, apocalyptic world. This is way worse than that. And people live like, yeah, dude, it's, it's insane.

Speaker 2:          01:46:30       Like you couldn't make a movie like this unless you added in later because you couldn't expect the actors to work in that kind of conditions. If you made a movie about the apocalypse. They have to, where's this at? China? Look at China live that long, right? No, they don't. They can't live long at all. It's just, it's killing them for sure. There's no doubt about it. There's no doubt about it. It's killing at a rapid pace. It's probably taking decades off their life record. Smog levels shutdown. City of Harbin, this is it. Pull it up. Uh, Brian pull up smog in China and it's the first video on, uh, under videos in Google. It's fucking crazy, man. You're seeing these people walked on the street and you're like, oh my God, you nutty. Fucks have poisoned your city to the point where people can't even breathe the air.

Speaker 2:          01:47:15       And it's still, everyone's tolerating it still. Everyone needs jobs still. Everyone needs to feed their kids. So they just let these businesses continue to operate the way they are. Everything. They should divide all the food. Everything should be shut down for a fucking month. Just let the air clear out. Jesus, look what you're doing. Pull up the video, Brian. Look what they're fucking doing. Look at this. Look at this Todd glass. Okay. Want to remember that? I look at it. Look behind you. Look behind you. Look behind. You can see it. This is fucking madness. This is a incredible, incredible madness.

Speaker 7:          01:47:47       Well, nine more than 20 anything above 300

Speaker 2:          01:47:51       I backed it up so that makes sense that he's describing what's wrong with the content.

Speaker 7:          01:47:55       Organization recommends daily levels of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micro meters to be no more than 20 anything above 300 is considered dangerous levels. Around a thousand were recorded in some parts of Harbin. All schools were shut and the airport was closed. Open. His home to sum it up

Speaker 3:          01:48:14       would have been still in your head going up and Philly, California. People don't understand that. No days, snow days was the greatest thing ever. Remember that boy? 98 one close. We were 102 they go 103 and whenever you were like skippy, be like, shut the fuck up. Remember you would call a number, the add a number to call for school closings. I would tell you all the school closings in a recording and they don't have that shit anymore. There's tweet it probably. Yeah, I'm sure they probably send the parents emails just on a mass email to all students. That's such a great one to think of like, Oh shit, that is like another fucking snow days are awesome. Did you hear about that? I never liked school. You didn't stay up? I see yellow bus. I get a stomach ache. What? Well, University of Iowa teacher, a teacher assistant sent out her whole entire class. She was supposed to send out like the answers to that thing, but sent out pictures of her and her boyfriend masturbating. Oopsies Iowa, Iowa. Woopsies so this is what happens when you fuck around with email. You don't know what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          01:49:24       Those snow days were fucking awesome on one second. Do you think that woman, I know, do you think she should get fired for that? Oh, but what do you think the masses thing, you think in that community? People are quick to judge. They're hypocrites. She's taking a picture of her father didn't. So what? Yeah, she is definitely an accident and obviously she's probably, I mean unless she's Cuny love, we might be wrong. Okay. We might be assuming it's an accident

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       and she might be just be like really a crazy attention person. It was like this is the way I'm gonna get attention. I'm going to send him pictures of me jerking off. That's possible. To course we limit that, but that's not, yeah, we shouldn't necessarily, I think you should leave all possibilities open up cause we don't really know her. I mean we limited when we're deciding if it's all right or not weeks. Yeah. Okay. Excluding that. No, that was her story holds true then. Yeah. So of course she should keep her job. People are so fucking judgmental and hypocritical. She's a woman who, I mean d depending upon of course your actual performance as a, as a teacher, let's just assume she was a great teacher. If it was a great teacher, also loves playing with her pussy. What do you give a shit? What?

Speaker 1:          01:50:28       You know the parents that would have a real problem with that. You're completely unrealistic and if she's playing with her pussy, she's having fun to me. She's going to be nicer to the student masturbating. So what? She feels good. It's her pussy. She's off work. You know she's not like sitting on the desk today. Kids are going to watch me jerk off. Not a bill in front of them at first I would like to have to fucking beat that thing up. A lot of people are more in channel and they like to go with extra for the list. I'm just telling you that one's going to teach you this but I'm going to teach you but don't tell your pants. I like to spend my hands cause I feel dirty. I want to just really beat it up side to side tends to speed bag.

Speaker 1:          01:51:03       Just look to go onto the heart or what are they writing things down? What do you think they're telling me? If you did that, first of all, this is all in the the in real life, which will never happen. What do you think? You know enough about enough about therapy, but you can get pretty fucking close to what we kids would do if you did exactly that in front of a room full of children. At what point would they go and may potentially does it with her pants on so it's not as gross. When we were imagining it, well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say pants on. I would say no panties to skirt. The kids do. Seriously not to be funny, but what rig out? They would freak out, right? They would start to cry, cry. Girls would scream, and this is not wrong that I'm even asking, is it?

Speaker 1:          01:51:43       Oh No, not wrong at all. I don't think they'd say, you hoard. Some girls they would say, well girl I grew up with would say, you are. Oh, what age were you? 14 you know, I'm talking about high school. Yeah. They would definitely know that debts don't like that. I brought this up. No, no, no. I think it's important that you brothers one judge. The answer made me look crazy because, no, no, no, no, no. I didn't know because if it's a good question. Okay. Nights. In fact, it's an interesting, it's, it's weird. You know what? What'd you do? What would you do? You think I'd take out masturbate? I didn't say that though, but I think there might be like a, a desire to get close to her if like this has happened more than once. Okay. In high schools, more than once. Some young attractive teacher has had sex with two or more boys from school, either on campus, like locking the door or take them back to her apartment. It happens, it happens all the time. It happens, I wouldn't say all the time, but it happens. It's happening several times in history. Hearing about it more and more to it. There's probably been half a dozen or so that's being

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       really conservative examples of this that have made it onto the news. So we know that people are doing it. You know, we, we know that we, we, it's not like, so you know, to say that someone sends these naked pictures of themselves woopsies I don't know what I did. Like she could be some crazy freak that wanted to beat off in front of the class, but they didn't want her to and she's like, yes, she really did send it

Speaker 4:          01:53:08       to everyone in their class. Oh, she wanted to do that. To not do it live but to, it could have been. I'm not excusing that

Speaker 2:          01:53:15       I, yeah, I do. I do not know what her motivation was or if it was actually an accident, but if it wasn't an accident, it is possible that there's a person out there and not saying it's her, but some person, a person who's willing to fuck every football player in her school and she's a 28 year old that's happened before. If there's a person like that out there, there's also a person that'll just email her pussy out there and go woopsies. Right. All my goodness. Did you see my pussy? Did you like it? What did you think about it? I didn't mean to send it to you, but now that you saw my pussy, what'd you think by the way? You basically in life get one freebie. Yeah. And then after that, thank God for keeping records leave. I accidentally sent my pussy to everyone again

Speaker 4:          01:53:56       the first time you're clear record. I think everybody gives you the benefit of the doubt and they should because can you imagine, by the way, we're only saying the 1% chance that it happened with some cray or 3% because we know 97% she's horrified. She's a decent person that just got out. It's like fuck. And then there's people that judge you were saying we don't want to be that. Exactly. We definitely will. We'll take a break. We'll be right back. Joe Rogan is my guests this afternoon. We'll ask him what he thinks of the new healthcare program when we come back and get into it and blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          01:54:25       Dead. Clarifying your point is very important to you. I like that it is the one that's not weird at all. It's thoughtful. I think you're very thoughtful about it.

Speaker 4:          01:54:33       Yeah. I tried to like, uh, yeah, it's the, it seems like I go backwards sometimes.

Speaker 2:          01:54:37       No, I mean sometimes you just thinking about things like you don't, you shouldn't. Odd. Americ automatically have a very fully formed opinion on certain subjects everybody thinks they're supposed to. And if you don't, you're an idiot. But there's nothing wrong with not having a fully formed opinion. As long as you're honest about it.

Speaker 4:          01:54:52       I always say that I always say the same thing. I'd go, yeah, as long as you're careful to say it like because uh, and I do, I try to go look, I'm still taking in stuff cause I think it lessens the anger if people at home that really genuinely might, no, you're wrong. I feel like they always tell them be comforted because if I get an email and it's intelligent and somebody breaks it down, you know what? I think the first time I read an email that educates me, I go holy fuck, I want to do an earlier podcast cause I want to come back on and go totally didn't think about that. So knowing that I will do that always lets me think. Okay. I'm comfortable to sometimes speak before I have formulated my, yeah. Opinion.

Speaker 2:          01:55:23       Yeah. It's important I think. And it's important to be honest about what you actually know, what you don't know. There was one of the funny things about this midnight in Paris movie was that, um, his wife and the movie was a, there was a guy saw in the clip was just like super intellectual guy who was like, you know, judging wines and he was a real, you know, annoying dude. And throughout the, you saw woody

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       Allen like a woody Allen's character, like battle with this guy about like facts and ideas and deal with his, uh, by bullshitting him, you know, so it's, I dunno, I think, I think it's important to let people know what you actually do. Now this movie, it was pathetic. It was funny, but Willy Alan was always pretending that he had facts he didn't have. Oh was that like the yeah, he, he would argue with this guy about some things that he hadn't researched at all. It was really fun. It was funny because he didn't know what you get lost. You're glad you come back. Cause it's like what a great and that, that movies out right now. Yes. Well, I watched it on a plane, but it was 2011 movies. So you could probably get it on a, you know, probably get it on apple TV or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:56:27       We've all, we've all done, we've all done that. Yeah. Yeah. There, especially when you're young bull shit, your brains out, you know, somebody posted on the message board that and the pollution in Beijing, it's pretty much identical to the low Pittsburgh had in 60 years ago and posted these photos. Oh, that's crazy. But that could be fog. I'm assuming it's not though. No, there's a, there's a Jesus Christ that's real. And that's in 19 what, 60 years ago. Who uh, what's the guy's name? I have vinegar taster and put a link to an article. Wow. That was, that was Pittsburgh not long ago. Whoa, that's nuts. Oh my God. Look at it on a map. That's, look at that from the sky. That's insane. Oh my God. When you look at it from, when you look at it from the top, like from an airplane, it looks like a big black cloud or a gray cloud over the city.

Speaker 1:          01:57:22       That's bananas. They cleaned it up all nice and good. Oh my headphones. Pittsburgh or injured. Is that because it's like the steel city and they probably had shitloads of steel factories and stuff like that? Probably back when he's back. Yeah, I would imagine. Yeah, I would imagine that's a lot of what the pollution is. You know, whenever there's a bad, in the past I remember in school I would ask my teacher, cause it's the only way I can visualize. I had no concept of the 1300 so I would ask her anytime we talked about an ear, if there were stores, that was in my head. That's what, and I think she, she was always very nice to me, but I think after a while I stopped asking you because we're their stores. Then they, I wonder if they even had locks back then. They must've right. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:58:03       but what they have, when did, okay, let's find out when was the invention of the lock. They used to have those keys like, yeah, let me know when you go to a hotel and they still have the old key and you're just like, really? You don't have a key card again, that's always weird isn't it? Isn't the police in Austin, I'm thinking, okay, the history of locks, I need to know this. Okay, ready? This the first serious attempt to improve the security of the lock was made in 1778 the first loc was s woe ready for this estimated to be 4,000 years ago. It was a four runner to a pin and tumbler type of lock, a common Egyptian lock for the time.

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       That's insane. The lock work using a large wooden bolt to secure a door, which had a slot with several holes in its upper surface and the holes were filled with wooden pegs that prevented the bolt from being opened. So that was the first invention of the LoC proving people that had been stealing shit for years. There's no year to go back to stealing shit. Well also figuring, figuring it out the need a gang of people working on this kind of stuff. In order to get things happening. You know, if you're going to figure out how to make a wheel or make a car, or maybe you need a lot of mother fuckers, dude who knows how to make tires figured out how to make rubber, you need to do to understand suspension components you need to do to understand the combustion engine. How do you get that into a a card? Make It, oh, we need a transmission guy. There's a lot of different variables and one person's not gonna invent a car.

Speaker 3:          01:59:29       Yeah, but even when you, yeah, that's, that's, it's funny to think about like someone I don't think about back then. The process that goes into it, like someone invented the wheel because that was the forward thinker. If that time, where was he writing his stuff down? Like what year was that? Does that, does that? When was the invention of the wheel? So did, they didn't have, they couldn't have written then. By the way, my, my history is atrocious. So if I ask any questions like what? No, it's all right. You're not pretending to be an expert. We're just talking. Thank you Kaitlin and time as we all right. I don't know man. That's a good question. That's what I'm saying. I, you know, I always picture the worst. Uh, for some reason in my head though, every listener, like even though I know I'm crazy, is this, no, he's talking about the map. He knows nothing about the map.

Speaker 2:          02:00:12       Well, there's images of uh, it as, as recently or as far back as 2,500 BC. That was for what? For four wheel. The invention of the wheel. The earliest well dated depiction of a wheeled vehicle. The earliest is 3,350 BC. It's a clay pot that has wheels. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:00:35       I'm not even joking when I ask this, even though you would think the answer would be no, I bet. I Bet I'd be wrong for thinking that the guy who had whatever, you got things around before that probably thought the guy with the wheel was crazy. Like he didn't see it in his head or like now it's hard to imagine someone not understanding a wheel. Well, that's, that's pretty, pretty fucking incredible. One of the old one was a square and then things like that guys like it's a star dirt good. You get good traction, you need to take a break and then you keep it.

Speaker 2:          02:01:04       That's what the Jewish stock came from. They drove around, they put it on a stick and the guy sat down there in the middle and the flicking. Okay. I pushed him. It was great for plowing fields as well. You till the soil as he drove it was good for agriculture. It drove around these stars of David's until someone say, hey, how about you just make it fucking around man, this fucking guy. He knows everything. How are we going to plow the fields if we have realm wheels? They just drive around like an asshole. Like wait, what? What are you doing? You're going to make roads everywhere. Is that what you're going to do? You're not gonna, you're not gonna do anything that's going to go in the dirt. Are you going to make your own road? How many roads

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       do you think not still with that is you think the world is going to be covered with roads all over the place. You could just drive your stupid fucking car that doesn't even drive over logs. There's a lot. It's everywhere. How are you going to make roads everywhere? That's a stupid invention. That's what they probably say. Get the fuck out of here with this. There's going to be roads everywhere. Don't fuck Outta here. Get on your horse and shut your fucking hole. This is as good as we got bro. It's very interesting. It's really interesting. Did they just take horse paths and just kind of made them wider? No, they had to fucking, they use tools. There's a lot of times they use tools. I mean you look it up. So those old California roads where you're going up the coast, but you could tell they carved it out of the, out of the row, the wall, they're like carved the CARF tunnels like in northern California especially.

Speaker 1:          02:02:26       They carved holes through the, through the buildings, through the, uh, through the rocks. And we're talking a long time ago, they did that shit a long time ago. They carve paths around mountain tops 200 300 years ago. They did it a long ass time ago. They did it before there was any cars. They did it when there was wagons. They would just, they would, they would grade the ground. They would cut it and you know, smash it down, roll it with things. They pulled things with horses. They tried to get the ground is soft and flat and straight as possible but barely, and they only did it like here's where the food is, here's where we go to sleep and this is where we got to work. Let's get this and that and this and then everybody stayed in that area. He didn't go anywhere back then.

Speaker 1:          02:03:03       You didn't get in your fucking horse and buggy and go to Arizona where taking the cad, the kids are going to go to California for the weekend. You ever see those bells on the side of the 101 I don't know if you've ever seen it. There's these bells. Are they just hanging on the side of the one on one and your dad the fuck is that every mile. Really? Yeah. And it's like, I always wonder what it was and that's the actual original path that they, they had dug down and they kept the bells there. And that was back when it was horse and buggy. Horse and buggy. Yeah. They made some roads with horse and Buggy, but you know, people lived on the coast. Um, most of the time there was some, some towns in the middle where somehow or another people got there because of the trains or something along those lines.

Speaker 1:          02:03:39       But when it was pre pretrained like way, way back 17 hundreds and shit, they came in boats. Let, let me ask you this then. So like let's say this, this is a, they start this village somewhere, you know, was there still a higher key of who doesn't do as much work as other people are at that course? That's always existed. Does, it's crazy to think so. What, like the person that would stop and not, maybe they get the ride the horse or something. It'd be like, it may pretend job for them. I think people died off easier that way because people didn't want to breed with them. And I think it's, it's, it's certainly always been a looked down upon aspect of people's personalities, but it's also super fucking common man because a lot of lazy bitches out there and there's a lot of people that don't understand how that being lazy like that is so bad for you in every way.

Speaker 1:          02:04:23       You're never going to achieve anything you ever want to. He never going to meet your expectations. You're never going to improve. He never going to like feel like a real sense of like accomplishing things. He's just lazy. He never gonna to put out, you're never going to really go for it. And that's it's, it's there for you to see so that you could see how gross it looks to other people. So when you meet someone, I think, you know, you meet someone who's troubled, oftentimes the, it's one of the best things that you could see without having to go through it yourself if you apply it. Yeah. If you see what makes, makes it feel weird about you? Like I don't remember who said this. Um, I think it was mark Twain or one of those fucking guys. He said a fool learns from the mistakes that he makes.

Speaker 1:          02:05:06       A wise man learns from the mistakes of others. Yeah, I love those. Yeah. What does it great there? They're great because they say so much. It's so, yeah, that's a big one. And that was one that was a great one. I think it was mark Twain to me, who the fuck knows who it was? It might've been Benjamin Franklin. Somebody great. Some old bad motherfucker [inaudible] of the long time ago. Wrote shit down and so crappy paper. Is it, did you ever even think or would even be something you'd want to think of if somebody said like, you know, what's a quote? You know, you can get it to go down or they're doing a wall of quotes and they call you and you get to have one of your quotes up there with all the, I would go over a picket never in a million. Oh, that's right. You can't pick it. Yeah, you would never, that's like giving yourself a nickname.

Speaker 3:          02:05:47       The comedy medicine man. Hey, I got Indian in feathers or how I go, Hey, I'm here to do at Sharman ceremony. I'm the comedy medicine man. He can't nicknamed me. She was jealous of those guys. Oh God. Do something off my thing be that's why I bought them.

Speaker 1:          02:06:05       Maybe there's somebody in the business. You know what? Maybe we can pick your own quotes and you can, I want to say this one thing now. I put this on my Twitter and um, some people still keep retweeting it. There's a, um, a thing that somebody attributed to me that was not my quote at all. It was a quote by a drag. Geraldo and I tried to tell people like when it, when it happened, I, I tweeted it, but the core, there's like a picture of me and it says, this homeless guy asked me for money the other day and I was about to give it to him. Then I thought, he's not going to use it on drugs. He's just going to use it on drugs and alcohol. Why should I give it to him? Then I realized that's what I'm going to use it on.

Speaker 1:          02:06:43       Why am I judging this poor bastard? That's, it's actually Greg draw though. Somebody got, must've gotten him confused with me and attributed that quote too. Yeah. But that's not my quote. He was a really, really fucking funny guy too. Greg Geraldo was, uh, uh, a good dude too. I knew him way back in the 1990s. He was out here doing his own TV show right next door while I was doing news radio. So, you know, we were super friendly. He's a really nice guy. Really, really fucking smart guy too. That's a great, that's a great joke too. Yeah, it's fine. Well, you know, that's his style. You know, it's totally even, it sounds like, are Geraldo joke. I didn't know him well, but it's almost says more about that type of comedian and, and the good part about comedy because I love Comedians. Yeah, me too. And I love it. I love comedians and loved comedians too. It's, it's, it's, uh, I, I appreciate that because it's, it is, it is something I really try to be aware of how lucky I am to be like, even though I'll complain about some of the ones that don't, like,

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       it's never a new comedians that I complain about. It's just really old bag comedians that do have no desire to change. I'm not, so that's my number one problem. It's not, it's not a new guy that might change. I don't, I don't judge a new guy that acts like another comedian cause you know what, he might grow out of it. I've seen comedians and emulate other comedians and then you look at him two years later you go, oh they came into their own. I don't judge in the beginning. I just root for it all. And I'm positive, very similar to musicians to do that. Really? Yeah. Because so anyway, when I talk about that, the guy that's doing it for like that, but this all started positive. But overall, I love comedians and I and and it's a great fraternity to be a part of and most of them were pretty decent, pretty soft and pretty cool and pretty honest. You know, you hang out, you feel you feel good around them.

Speaker 2:          02:08:19       I love Dom Irrera and one of the things I love about Domino Rera is dom I rera is always working on his act always. He truly loves comedy. It's not just what he does for a living. He truly loves doing comedy and he works on it all the time. He hasn't ever hit the get ups, give up switch. Some guys just hit that, give up switch and then they start complaining and you're around them. They complaining about the business. The business keeps screwing guys like me and you're like, dude, I haven't heard your sat in forever. I haven't seen a special out of you and forever. I haven't seen you haven't seen a website that's out. I haven't seen blogs you've written. I haven't seen a podcasts. You've done. I haven't seen a fucking let them in appearance. I haven't seen anything from you. You stopped. You stopped doing comedy and now you're whining like shut the fuck up. Go and do it. And they're a drag man. They're fucking drag.

Speaker 4:          02:09:07       There's such a big difference from complaining cause I know someone taking this out of context. I mean including me going, I love to complain about a clubs that don't get it or when they don't set it up right. But that's not my majority. I also spend a shit ton of time talking about good and positive things. But the other guys there, well after a while it's hard to be around them because you like, you have to do a lot of head nodding and you think at one point don't they realize I'm not agreeing because they get to the point where I can't agree on it.

Speaker 2:          02:09:31       You're beating, you taken a near beat. Yeah. They just beat you down. What do you just give him a little bit of that and they accept that? Oh, those guys are brutal. There was a guy that, uh, I was friends with that I, I had to stop those back in the day. I was friends with them for a long time. Like I met him in the 90s and uh, he did not do well. He moved out to Los Angeles and now these are real insecure guy and real problems with, you know, trying to go on auditions, who's trying to be a comedic actor. I like the guy, I enjoyed him. Like there was a percentage of the time that I loved being around him. I loved it when we were laughing and joking and talking about things. I loved being around him. But then there was another part that was maybe it was only 10 20% of the time.

Speaker 2:          02:10:11       It was an unbearable, it was torture. And I tried to let him know, I tried to say, lick man, you know, I appreciate that you're struggling. I pee appreciate you're out here in California. And it, you know, it's hard to make things happen, but here's what you got, man. You're a talented guy. You're a talented guy, you're a funny guy. Just keep doing it and you'll figure out how, what it is. You'll find a manage you an audition, you'll make a set that goes onto it. You're going to find it the most important things that you're enjoying yourself and you're out here, you know, doing what you love to do for a living. That shit never flew with him. Why is this fucking guy is fucking guys on TV? How come this fucking guy got a development deal? You know what man, I'm turning the TV. I'm seeing this fucking guy with a show and I'm like, maybe this is not the business for me. Me, me, I'm in the wrong business. I saw that fucking guy set. This fucking guy was terrible. Let me tell you something. I mean, he was like open mic night. Terrible. I can I can I tell you,

Speaker 4:          02:11:00       I told someone who by the way, they're not that case yet. And matter of fact of the half, half of my life is being afraid of saying any names. Um, this is, this isn't even a bad thing. Like this is actually giving this person, you know, credit, right? But, um, that they were aware of it, but it has to do with what you're talking about. Uh, uh, complaining but, but not, not that, not that bad yet, but it could be going down that path and maybe I want to help a little and I said, let me ask you a question. If some celebrity offered you, um, I didn't know what figure to make up. I go $10,000 a month right now. Does 10,000 a week exactly. To write funny tweets. He, you know, it's a weird make pretend thing, but I go, they call you on the phone.

Speaker 4:          02:11:38       He goes, listen, I want to start tweeting more and you know, my voice you'll given to me at the end of each day. I'll pick a few. I like, you know, it's a, it's a good paycheck, but it's okay. I'll give you a $10,000 a week, whatever it would, would you be able to do that you need? No. No. I asked, what would you think? No, go ahead. Handle. I asked him and he's, I know he could. He goes, yeah. And I went, well then write some for yourself. Like did the, why are you not that you at least should be tweeting funny tweets now me, could I do it? No, but I don't want to get a job as a writer. I don't think that's my strong point. This person is so like, you know, write some funny tweets. I take advantage of what there is.

Speaker 2:          02:12:14       Well if you, if you just have a couple thousand followers, okay, let's say if you're a comedian, you're struggling, you've got a thousand followers to see a thousand, I guarantee you out of those thousand people, if you say something that's truly funny, they're going to hit that retweet button and it might be a slow trickle. Where would it be? Like a few other people get it and then a few other people get and a few people steal it and they'll just fucking copy it and throw it. That's a, that's a real common thing with non known funny people with tweets. But then people get found because of that. Our friend Kathleen up in Toronto slash lean on a Twitter. She's uh, w we hung out with her and uh, Toronto, she's just a Twitter comedian. And she wanted to do standup, but she never really did it. You know, we, me and Doug Benson and who the fuck else was with us up there?

Speaker 2:          02:13:02       I think I was Callin. Hmm. Maybe. Uh, it was in Toronto. I don't remember. Was it Ari? Whatever, whatever it might have been. Ra, whatever it was. Um, she was like, she's really funny and now she's got a development deal. She's like doing a show on MTV. Right. All from Twitter. And we know people. He's supposed to say that. And that's what to say. Anything, I don't know. Is it, is it supposed to be a known Cognito? Whoops. Oh, you don't, I didn't know man. You didn't, can't tell me Shit like that. And then it's supposed to be a seat.

Speaker 4:          02:13:28       No, no. Okay. Whenever it ain't no people just got my point is got like 50,000 Twitter followers or something. She's hilarious. Yeah. Yeah. People are going to, and again, it's not me saying that about myself because it's for a tweeting is I tweet and I like it. It's not my strong suit. But this person, if you're claiming you're right or anybody out there that says they're a writer should ask themselves the same question like, yeah, fucking, you're right. It doesn't mean you have 3 million overnight, but you will see your numbers grow. And obviously we, we, like I just said, we see a lot of these people, so it's just applying what certain people do to your friends that don't realize you could do it. Here's what she said.

Speaker 2:          02:14:03       Here's our latest tweet her, her name on Twitter is Princess Anus and she writes, turned on the little heater under my desk at work crunching numbers and cooking pussy. She's showing her pussy like her pants looking down at the the heater. It's right underneath her. She lives in Toronto. It's cold as fuck. Pull the picture up Brian. It's hilarious. It's slash lien on Twitter. How did you find out about this girl? Uh, somebody tweeted her, so she's got 71,000 followers now and she's not like a famous person. Look at that. Just got it. She shows a picture of her buzzy above the heat or she's just a funny girl. She says a lot of funny shit.

Speaker 4:          02:14:44       Yeah, it's good. It's, it proves that it works. Chris Carmona he reads, writes a lot of funny tweets and people, uh, you know, you just start noticing after a while someone forwards it to you.

Speaker 2:          02:14:53       She had a great joke about blowing a guy, um, who like blowing so many drunks that she didn't pass her, uh, her breath, the test breadth detector tests cause she had sucked the drunk guys deck. It was really funny man.

Speaker 4:          02:15:11       I love it when somebody like that, you know, I always, I've said this a million times, but like I don't mind giving jealous when people, you know, have early success in size. We have to remember the people that aren't doing it anymore. But I also tried to turn the jealousy in a motivation as opposed to like bitterness, you know, just try to like get, okay, that's cool. You get a little jealous and then think, what could I be fucking doing

Speaker 2:          02:15:30       says here, no matter what the letters are all knuckle tattoos. Say Dad's gone. That's so rude. Just accidentally stabbed my face on a dick. A true friend will tell you when your yoga pants are sucking your pussy lips up like a three toed sloth. It's a funny fucking Twitter page and she does it all the time. If you look at it, you know every couple of days she bangs out a good one. So like her, her like numbers, like she'll like take a couple of days off or something. But the numbers that she puts like what she, whatever she puts out there is like really high quality. She doesn't have a lot of stupid tweets like my mind is a lot of useless tweets. I mean some of them are funny and some weed everyday shit. Pretty much. Yeah. If I find anything, I mean I'll take days off if I find things that are interesting. I think it's my duty almost to like retweet things I think are interesting. He got like 1.5 million followers and someone comes along and shows you something that you think other people be interested in. It's your duty to send

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       it out. Like hey check this out. Like they're your friends. Like that's what I would do with you. That's a great way to look at it. If you've got an interest, like if sort of like modeling whatever, clays fucking making sculpture, whatever the fuck it would be, sail boating. And I said, Oh Todd, like sail boating. It's a cool article on sail boating. Boom. I would send it to you. If you were into science. Boom, I would send it to you. That's what you're doing on Twitter. Like someone sends you something that makes, you know, you go whoa. So you're sending it to all your friends. You know all those people on Twitter that are your followers. It's ironic that the, they're your followers, you know, they follow the, you really should probably call him a Twitter friends. That'd be like a nicer way. It might be a little warmer. It's, but it's really what it is. You know? Why are they following me? Yeah. Fuck you father time and you're not my real dad. Human to hire somebody to write funny tweets for me. Why not? Fuck it. Anybody can I tell you when they correct me on spelling, I want to have a God damn.

Speaker 4:          02:17:24       I want to find the person. And I don't want to do what I want to do because I have to calm down before I started doing what I want. I want to talk to them at the end of the day, but I want to go, what is wrong with you? Seriously? Who are you? That's what I want to look at. Someone to go, who are you? You read that? I'm not going to yell at you. I'm just going to, when you read it, you saw there's a spelling mistake is really that you were motivated to fix. Re who are you? Are you seriously like, it sounds silly. I get it, but then there's also like, yeah, who are they? Who are you? What do you do to everyone else in your life? If that's what you, the first thing, I'm trying to be funny, I'm a comedian. I'm not a good speller, but your goal is good.

Speaker 1:          02:18:04       It was people are angry. They're angry. Todd glass life is not what they wanted it to be. Well, let's say they said this, we're trying to help. I still go, all right. Now you're just making yourself the victim. There's a lot of that that you know what there is, there's paths, there's, there's ways you manage your life in this pass. He'd go down and if you go down that I'm a victim path by instinct, by automatic reflexively. A lot of people do. Goddamn those people are annoying. Those people are so fucking annoying. It's a real problem.

Speaker 4:          02:18:37       I tend to agree with you on most of the things you say. You know, I'm, I'm in always in a pretty have the same area. Sometimes you say it in a better way than I say so it still helps to listen to it cause I, it helps me fight the fight. So I, I think preaching to the choir as good. I don't think it's a waste of time. We're doing a fingers that move the presales folks listening to this. I think sometimes it's good to hear it because you, it's like I said, it hit it from another perspective. I'll drop an analogy I use. If someone gives me a better one, I'm like, oh, that's better. Mine's gone. I love that one.

Speaker 1:          02:19:04       I think we naturally would just, we were talking about cults earlier and, and you know, people arguing over ideologies. I think we naturally form tribes, you know, and I think there's some tribes are formed just based on behavior and belief systems and geography. And we get these weird things and very dangerous.

Speaker 4:          02:19:22       You might think, I swear to you, I think this genuinely has to do with what we're about. I'm not trying to go cheap segue. If I am, you'll know from my gut. I didn't think I was, I believe you 100%. The only thing I wrote down and I wanted to talk to you about was, uh, it's not here anymore, was the when people, you said they will need the, you said they will form tribes. People will just say so. Okay, here we go. So podcasting is original, basically taking radio and making it as, you know, just getting rid of the middle management. It's just, it's pure stand up. So that's what it is. It's getting rid of that person. So there's this thing that happened by, I think if you're right that people will naturally create their own rules. So we got rid of the person that you just do what you want.

Speaker 4:          02:19:58       And then there became the was Yolie do an hour podcast by people that did bod test. They decided that and I felt a little bit of that. Now should I only do it and then you, this is why I'm thanking you. If someone go, oh no, Joe Rogan, he does a three hour podcasts. I'm like thank fucking God. Cause it was like, yeah, like I want to do three hours, leave me to so, but that whole rule was made by the, here's this great institution, get rid of all the business radio. It's a great tool. Get rid of all the business. Get rid of anyone telling you what to do. It's just us now. And someone decided to go, yeah, you only do it as an hour.

Speaker 2:          02:20:29       Here's one thing I want to put out there too. This is really important. You don't have to do commercials in the middle. You fucking podcast. You don't, I don't do it. I won't do it. I never will do it. I'm not interrupting the fucking show because it's brutal. It's brutal. It, it fucks with the conversation. It puts a hitch in the conversation and you, we've Umaine yourself afterwards in post here, but if you interrupt the conversations, start reading off a page, we're starting from scratch again.

Speaker 4:          02:20:53       Certainly. We've certainly heard good people that had to do it when they had radio do it and it's not the best part of it, but we still love them. They don't have to do, he knew more. Now you don't have to do that. So I totally, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:21:04       since you don't have to do it is because if you are selling things that you actually believe in, we have a series of different products that we agree to, but we've turned down a lot of products. I'm like, I have no use for that. I wouldn't use that in real life. I don't agree with it. I don't like what it is that I've turned down. Podcast sponsorships to promote things that I don't believe in. Movies that aren't believing shows that I don't believe in. Once you make that sort of an agreement, well, people will support the things that support your show automatically. They would want to, if it really is a good product. Who is that? That's me. God dammit. You see that? You know what that has pitches with this is is a Samsung Galaxy note three that I'm super happy with. Oh my goodness. How do I reject, reject a call with a message? Okay. Hmm. Sorry, I'm busy. Call back later. I just sent a message.

Speaker 4:          02:21:54       You know what? You know what I always think of when we're, when I'm having conversations like this,

Speaker 2:          02:21:58       it's beautiful silence the size of this thing. Folks at home, it's going to let you know I'm 100% android now, fully converted and not just fully converted, committed. Love it. It's amazing and it's great. Is it okay in your pocket? Yes. Yeah, it fits in my back pocket. I had his contact. It's a Google phone, unfortunately. So you have your phone contacts. Get confused with Google. That was the only the issue. The only issue I've had at all was just merely transferring my, that's

Speaker 1:          02:22:25       it. Everything else has been great. This is Courtney on this thing is amazing. There's two things. I'll figure that out. There's a program, sorry, because when there's a program, um, called a smooth sync for Icloud, couldn't be pulls it right over seizing it takes three seconds cause I'm super happy with this. The um, the camera's a little wooded. We got off the air and you go, it's a piece of shit they're inducing. This is just so much stuff you can do with these things that an iPhone would never let you do. There's so much weird shit that you can get done with these things. It's that thing big and too big though to carry around in your pants. No. You know what's not big of, it's just a matter of getting use it. Look, I have a magazine that I choose on my own. I choose all the content and scroll through it every day and it gives me stories based on interesting shit.

Speaker 1:          02:23:09       It comes standard with the phone. There's a you, it's so easy to cut and paste images and put them in a scrapbook, cut and paste URLs, save websites. You save documents on it, you can actually download and save things, which the I to phone never lets you do. You're not allowed to download things on the iPhone. Just put them in a file and this, you could put it, put things in files when you want to play music. He just grabbed the music and drag it in there. It takes three seconds. You'd have to load iTunes or anything weird like that. It's way more. It gives you way more freedom in a lot of ways. That's bad. And for some people it's probably not what they want. They want something that just works, you know? But if you're a person like me that's like really into technology and finds it fascinating to fuck around with new things, you can't beat that screen son.

Speaker 1:          02:23:53       That's gigantic. When you go and watch read websites on this, it's, it's almost like a laptop iPad. Why would I want it when I have this in my pocket? Super Big. It seems so easy to use. It's easy. It fits right in my pocket. It seems bigger than it really is. I mean it is. It's big to the point where it's not like sitting on my fucking shirt here. It's big to the point where like if you had it in your pocket, you wouldn't want to sit down. He wouldn't want to sit down like this with no my back pocket. But if I'm just like walking around, it fits fine. This is huge. It is huge. But it fits the difference being to me. First of all, it's fascinating. I like fucking around with the new operating system. I like playing with it. Everything seems to work real easy. The processors, the fucking pictures are incredible. The pictures, this thing takes their magical, I mean it's just, I don't know, what is it, 12 megapixel or something by the way,

Speaker 3:          02:24:50       actually funny cause I know just gracefully happen, but we're talking about I would never do it. The sponsor and then I know you're feeling like that's not a sponsor. No, no it's not. This cell phone isn't sponsored me. No, that's what I mean. Sometimes like in life I'll say something, I will be so passionate about something like you are and I go, there's no way. If that was they film that they could ever play that because there's no fucking way anybody would believe that was real. But it is. I'm like, there's some product I'm talking about. I go off on how good it is, how could nobody have it? And then I think there's no way someone would believe that. But that's how passionate I am. But I believe you because I know that you wouldn't do that. But there's some people that you know would, where some people, you know, it's sneak in a commercial and pretend

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       that they really love their galaxy note phone and it's really just a commercial. Somebody in a silly person. Yeah. But the, you know, the, the idea of commercials interrupting things is unnecessary and it's not just unnecessary. It's not good for the product. It's not good for the experience. Just get good sponsors, play it in the beginning, played at the end. Say thank you to your sponsors. Let everybody know those your sponsors. We've had a lot of like really loyal sponsors like Ting and Squarespace and as, because we'll mention them even when we're not doing a commercial, it's, we really do believe, I really believe in Squarespace. Somebody who might be one of the ads for this show, but they're fucking great. It's a beautiful design. It's a great way to make websites. If I find something cool, I would let you know, even if it's not paying me money to let, yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:26:12       You know how it's, um, you know, we always guess what we would do, what we wouldn't do it. I know it's always a hypothetical when you turn down because you can act morally on your high ground when you turned down something that wasn't offered to you. But I you, we do it all the time. We all may pretend as Comedians, would you do this? Would you do that? And I wouldn't do Batman fucking mainstream comic book movie. You know, and you don't know until those things are put ahead of you until those things are put in front of you. And the first one. Now granted I'm trying to, I'm not saying I'm a, I turned down some shit ton of money, but at least it was an example when I did stick to my instincts of don't do something bad. I learned the copy for this phone thing and then I remember the next day waking up and going, look again, I, you know, how much I would've made it a new sponsor who received a check for $50 maybe.

Speaker 4:          02:26:51       I don't know what we get, but, um, I didn't understand it was one of those ones that I hate and I go, you can't. So I, I was afraid that they were going to be like, oh no, you have to do it. I called back, I'm Katie at the time and when Katie, I, that's, I don't even fucking understand this. And it's like, I don't want it. She was, oh, you don't have to do it. I was like, oh, cool. Yeah, I didn't know if there was there supporting us now, but they were like, no, no, no, no, no. So that really made me happy. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:27:15       it's nice. And you can also, people will, will gravitate. Like there's been a few people that we've talked about their products, uh, on the show where they've never been sponsored, but people know about it because of us. And I just want people to know about that. Like that Green Mountain Grill guy that has those pellet grills. Great. Greg gave us his, he doesn't pay us, he gave us these grills and he's like, look, I think, just think these things are amazing. And I would love to sponsor the podcast. It didn't work out. He doesn't sponsor the podcast, but they're so cool. I got to tell people about him. I would always tell people about him, whether it was a sponsor or not. You could cook something, one of these fucking things for like hours at a time. They use pellets like hardwood pellets, a called pellet grills. It's like a new thing. Oh, it's the temperature stays exact. So like if you want to cook a roast outside, like smokey hardwood and cook it for like 300 degrees for like four hours or something like that. You do that. You just said it. It's amazing.

Speaker 4:          02:28:08       I didn't know that there were pellet grills because my parents live in an old home in Philadelphia and they had a pellet stove in the living room and that would come in bags and they're like wooden and they're very natural. It's very compressed hardwoods, natural sugar. It looked like rabbit a little bit. It does.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       It looks like that kind of cat litter I use to get the green stuff. Do you use that stuff? That pine stuff's good. It's the best stuff. And kills the smell of the best. Yeah. How many do you have a, how many cats do you have to, to what are they just cats or they have, one of them is a rag doll cat. No one tells are these there? He'd go limp. When you pick them up, they're like real sweet. Oh really? Yeah. And the other one is, she's part per, she's a Mutt. She's part Persian and part, uh, like Tomcat. She's like 16 years old. She's 16 years old. She acts like she's a kitten. It's crazy. She says, totally healthy. Come when you come home, she talks to you like, my whole house thinks it's hilarious. Just have conversations with this cap. What? Sometimes it's annoying. I'm not going to lie, but you know, she cool cat.

Speaker 1:          02:29:07       My friend Andrew is my friend. Andrea has a cat. And um, it, it's crazy. Not only does it, which I've seen a lot when you know, like you go into someone's house, I like if a cat jumps up on the sofa next to me, so, but it eats potato chips. Whatever you're eating wants to eat. And it fetches. So I'm like, are you shitting me? I used to have a cat that fetches, see, I would if to me, if you're home alone and you have a dog or cat, anything, just to have it, it just, it is a bonus when you get patches because it's like you can do something in the potato chips because it's like you're maybe your home by yourself and you're just sitting there and I, the fact that this other thing wants something and you give it one of the beats it, you don't give it too much of it.

Speaker 1:          02:29:42       This cat hated everybody. But me though it was great because it fest it fetch balls. They take a little ball of paper and crumple it up in a ball, toss it, and would chase after and swat it and it would bring it back to me and then I would throw it again. We would play games, but she hated everybody but me, she hissed at me when I saw her in the pet store, like all the other kittens were in this little pet store and she just like history. I was like, oh, give me that one. Really like, she's crazy. That's the one that needs, well, not just that. It's like, no, no, no, no. I'm always been akin to the wilder creed. You don't have a dog. You have two dogs. What do you, was it the dog's doing a, she blew, he knew English bulldog mix and I'm a massive, oh, you have a master that's, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:30:27       The other one, I'm not sure what it is, but a master of, into it there. Yeah. He's a, he's a small, massive, he's 140 pounds, so it's called a regency mastiff. They, uh, it's half Neapolitan mastiff and they breed them with pit bulls to make this dog. It's like a really athletic, massive, but they, uh, they're, they, they're big. It's a big, like 140 pound dog, but it moves like a panther. It's crazy how fast these things are and how powerful they are. But super sweet. The sweetest dog. I got him for his personality. His Dad was on fear factor and uh, I couldn't believe how sweet that dog was. We would use him as an attack dog. We'd put people in the suits and he would send them out to attack. But to the dog, it was just a game. Like he wasn't mean to people at all, but when the owner told him what to do, that was the game was to go do it. And then you've got rewarded for that. So we put these people in these giant attack suits and this dog just grabbed them and boom, threw him to the ground. But was mean like

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       when it was over. Well, you okay out? He stops. He backs up and I go, how was his dog? So cool? He goes, I don't let the assholes breed. He goes, I just, I make sure that all my dogs, they never have any dog aggression. They never have any people aggression. So this dog was just chilling with all these other dogs. He's a, it looks like a lion, like this black lion and it's just sitting there, chit his, he was even bigger. He was 190 pounds. His father was very big, but he's just sitting there and I'm like, why is that dog so nice? Like this doesn't even make sense. Everybody would come by. He would like look at you twice.

Speaker 4:          02:31:53       That's why I remember my mom bred dogs when we were growing up. And uh, not, not like a puppy Miller. And uh, she said that when dogs bite out of fear, they're not going to bite when something really happens anyway. It was mean that somebody takes a shovel and lifts it up in the air where their hand, those dogs cower. So the dogs that are trained from like it, same thing. Like what you're saying, my friend's a cop and to see the dog, how calm it is. Like, I know what that dog's capable of and then it's so super confident. It doesn't bite out of fear. Exactly. Doesn't bite at a fear, you know

Speaker 2:          02:32:24       these mastiffs it's one of the reasons why there's such great dogs because they're really like relaxed and calm around people that hadn't worried about you. What are you going to do? Like unless you have a gun, what are you going to do? Two, 190 pound mass stuff. Not a lot, man. There's not, this isn't going to take long. You know, they listened to us out of love and you know when you have a dog that you race from a puppy and really love this guy, his name is Joe and he has this, uh, this, I mean he doesn't, he doesn't have a puppy mill at all. He has the opposite. Like he re they're called regency mastiffs and it's a breed that he created himself that he's been working on for like decades. And so he's like super specific about what dogs he lets breed.

Speaker 2:          02:33:02       And at the end of the day, he has this amazing companion like this Johnny, Johnny, Johnny Cash is my dog. He's the sweetest dog I've ever had in my life. I mean, he's just a gentle, big giant who's just, he loves everybody. He loves my three year old. He loves my five year old, loves other kids, other kids come over. He's immediately like happy. He doesn't get weird around them. He's like super. Any friend that comes over, you've met Johnny. He's super friendly. Right? Like immediately. You don't feel sketched out by him at all. Right? Right. No, I love your dogs. Both of them. Yeah. But and booboos very sweet too. They're all sweet dogs. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:33:32       You know, one time I used to, I was about five years ago watching a friend's dog and I saw one day in the street what the dog did to another day. He went, I've never seen him like that, that type of aggression towards another door. Nothing happened. I had him on his leash, but I was like, I never saw it. And I remember thinking it was the type of dog that when I had him, I would bite his face and just love them and buying them. And I thought I'd be afraid to do that now. But guess what? But that night I did, I was like, cause he was so like I go, that's a different, and I'm a chicken, I'm a chicken. But I just, I get it when people are comfortable around animals because they'll sense it. Cause I don't know why I just thought no, he's that way with that dog. So I'm like going back to biting him. Sawso

Speaker 2:          02:34:09       probably protecting you. He doesn't trust that dog. He doesn't know why that dogs near him. That dog is violating his territory by being a stranger in near him instinctively. So unless he's socialized, unless you take them around other dogs all the time, it's a natural instinct to want to ward off other dogs. That's why I'm raising a dog. You could raise a dog that's really sweet with people, which my dogs were. But then we have real problems with other dogs, especially if it's genetic, like pit bulls or something along those lines. I've seen it. There's no way you can avoid it. You can't avoid it. The only thing you could do is socialize those dogs and bring them around a lot of other dogs and constantly reprimand them or stop them from, uh, from attacking and stopped them and keep them exercised. You got to wear them out, like throw the ball with them having play and only like make it a positive experience when they meet other dogs.

Speaker 2:          02:34:56       But still you could run into some other dog that tests them and next thing you know, they're going at it. But they don't have that to you though. Like all my dogs that I've ever had, whether they had problems with other dogs or not, they've all been sweet to people. All of them. They just can't wait to jump up and kiss people because that's all they get. All they get is sweetness at home. You know, they get, hey, don't eat that. Hey, don't chew that no bad. But they don't get beat up. They don't get yelled at. They get kissed and hugged. And when you have an animal like that,

Speaker 3:          02:35:24       you were saying the, uh, you know, there, when they get around other animals that they've been seen. That's why a long time ago I made this rule like, oh, it'd be like a bunch of us running maybe a house up in lake arrowhead or something and where people go, hey, can we bring the dog? And then I would trust them. They will go, he's, oh no, he's so calm. He's so calm. But then someone else would ask and if there were two dogs, they weren't they and they would all apologize all weekend. They're not normally like that. I know, but they are here. You're bringing them around fighting or even if it's not somebody, even if their dogs calm at home, sometimes it can not be common another place because it's not comfortable. There's noises. So I'm not mad at the dog, but I'm like, there's always exceptions.

Speaker 3:          02:35:57       I get it. But overall, my feeling is there are exceptions, but overall, leave your dog. I totally agree. I've brought my dog places and it's selfish. It's selfish. I was selfish when I did it. And people who do it, they don't think they're being selfish. But I mean, you could do it. Like if it's one of my friend's dogs and I love the dog and I've been around the dog a lot, and I don't mind, that's one thing, but a lot of times the dog dominates your thinking. Now that dog, where's the dog? There's a dog in the kitchen. The dog, the dog in my bathroom, my bathroom man, when we went camping, Eh, not even from, I wasn't crazy that these people, by the way, you know why I always say there's always exceptions because I live a very parent. Maybe it's not a paranoid life, but I've had dogs where people bring them and I'm happy they brought their house. Of course, I even ask I who know, bring your dog, bring your dog. So there's, but over all, you got to test the waters a little. You know what I mean? I don't want anybody that I would think that would listen and I, and I'd be like, no, no. You were talking. I really did. Like, I'm not just making exceptions, but overall leave your dog at home. Yeah. Overall unless you have an understanding, right.

Speaker 2:          02:36:56       Like each other. Like I have my friend Robbie, when I first got my dog, he had a dog, there was a boxer and him and my dog were like, they would get together and they're both basically the same age. I think his dogs are a little bit older and they would just go fucking nutty, just run around in circles and bounce up in the air. When they saw each other, they were so excited because they were pals. Like they had decided to like really early on they, they

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       play font and stuff like that. But they were buddies. So when they were around each other, they're like, holy shit, I can't believe you're here. Woo. And they would just start bouncing and jumping. And it was fun. It was, but we had to watch them. You know, we had to watch them every five seconds. You forget about those two type of dog cause you're right. On the most part, you're lucky if they're just don't care about each other. But when they get along. Yeah, it is like too, I remember growing up we had our friend's parents who would bring their dog over and you could just tell they were like in the yard and getting along and like, just look at them. They're friends. Yeah. It's cool when, when dogs are buddies, you know, it's cool when they, they, they, they, you know that's in dogs are pack animals too.

Speaker 1:          02:37:52       That's the other thing. Dogs want to be around other dogs. Like they love being around people, but they also love being around dogs. Like to leave a dog by itself all the time. It's kind of sad. It gets lonely, you know? Yeah. You're your dog. Selfish Bitch Paul Little Dog. No, I'm pretty good except for Monday, sir. Hey, how long you got to do what you gotta do you ever have somebody, they'll go like, how long can you, what do you think the, the reasonable amount of time on it? Five days a week to leave your dog at home alone is, well, five days a week. It's not, the house is tough. Um, let's, so we can be just so we can, let's save doggy door to a yard. Oh wait, no. That widens it a lot. That makes a big diverse and I'm thinking of no, no.

Speaker 1:          02:38:32       Uh, no Doggie door is potty trained on IPADS. Well that's pretty, it sounds good on paper. What it is, is these paper towels with shit on him in your house? Yeah. It's fucking, it's fucking disgusting. I know that this potty trained, he only shifts all over the place. They're gross beyond gross. But the worst is like my old dog used to just go when I had carpet would piss and you would never know about it. And then so when we tore up the carpet it was just like, oh my God. How much pissed it might've been. Your cat shits all over the place. Your dog, your cat pissed a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Especially the cat. The cat is upset that you live with a dog now. Like you brought a dog into the cat's house and catch a cause. The bitch piss everywhere. You're not even here.

Speaker 1:          02:39:18       You mother fucker must treat this thing like I would treat it like they did. They totally decided that there's like, I haven't seen that guy in 10 hours. I'm just going to piss like what would I do in the wild? They're just piss right here. So that's what they started doing. The litter box stinks. He doesn't clean it. I'm just pissed behind a couch over here, that smell refrigerator. Hey, they want to be, they want to be treated right. My cats don't piss in the house. You know when my cat was pissing in the house, when I would change the litter box, like every couple of days, I would change it like every three or four days and she would pee in front of the door. Sometimes. The old one, you can't yell at her. She's 16 but I'm like, what are you stupid bitch? Like what are you doing? Like pissing in my house. And then I realized, you know why she only does that if the litter box is kind of funky. So now that I clean it every single day, she never does that stopped, you know, they don't want to do that. You just dirty bitch. He had a fucking big box at shit. She preaching step in. You know what I was thinking if let's say you had a cat and you had like, well you know what, what I'm about to say? Probably we could afford it. Let's say it was $3,500 a

Speaker 3:          02:40:14       Wa a hard plumbed cat box. Hard plumbed meaning that's what they call it. Like, like if you have like a, some people like take their trailer and they put it next to their home and sometimes they use it as a guest house or they, I heard a plumber wants to go, your heart plummet, which means you hook it up to the regular sewage. Right, right. So if you had a heart, like a toilet, but it's a cat box, wouldn't it be great in New York? That's very possible. Typically it's like a little toilet. Maybe there's some sort of litter that way you never have to change your cat box. You just flush it. Yeah. But it doesn't seem like the Cabbie down with that. They want to shit and dirt. Dana, what if you put dirt in their toilet? Yeah, there was cats. If you can do that, but doesn't she have one of those big crazy sphinx cats or something?

Speaker 3:          02:40:47       Or she has the skinless cats. Yeah, that's what I mean. It's just thanks Kat. It, yeah. Forgot about to go in the toilet. Maybe my whole idea is not a good one. Well, they do do that. There's a, yeah, she has a sphynx cat. I'm pretty sure that's the hairless one. There is. Um, I've seen pictures of it on Twitter. There's a, um, a bunch of people that have videos and how to train your cat. That shit in the toilet. Yeah. I didn't trust, wasn't thinking. See, look, here's that. Dane is doing it. That's so crazy, dude. What is going on inside that toilet besides the p? I think that's the training. That's the training thing, you know? Oh, to teach the cat how to be in there. Oh, that makes sense. Oh, maybe she gets a treat. Oh, that's so smart. That's really smart.

Speaker 3:          02:41:35       What Kulak and cat. It's an alien. It's cancer. Awesome. And if you're allergic to cats, these cats don't have dander. So you can actually have this as a cat. Yeah. Are they supposed to be sweet? Yes. Supposed to be cuddly. Cars are amazing. They need body temperature. They need body heat. So they want to snuggle with you all the time. Yeah, she's always taking bath. That's why they bred the, I would imagine like there was no really reason to breed the standard poodle to the golden retriever or Labrador, except that they, they know that they're big cool dogs. But people wouldn't want it cause it's a poodle. I think maybe because we had a standard poodle growing up and then when we were little, we didn't want to get it. My parents had to lie what they were, cause we wouldn't want a poodle. Why not?

Speaker 3:          02:42:11       Because it's not cool. It's not cool. But my mom said, dog, did you want a lab? Anything but a poodle. Like we were little and we took it to this place. I remember it was like this woman Ruth Lukens and it was immaculate and it was like a woman that really loves her literal puppies she had and they came running out and we loved them. We were, it was probably like in fifth grade or fourth grade, my brothers all about the same age and we all, they were so cool. And then we had to learn that they were eventually standard poodle and we got one Billy and then bear and they were big. Like there was like 90 pounds, a hundred and almost close to a hundred pounds. He was a big mail, but now, but labradoodle isn't sending any cooler. Well it's a thing like a combination thing that people like is thing too.

Speaker 3:          02:42:49       They love saying it and social circles. Oh, he's got a labradoodle. I love those. Have you seen those? They're so cute. It becomes one of those and they don't shed. That's the thing. Oh that's the reason I picked the standard poodle. You'd get the dog, it doesn't shed. They're smart. And then they, that actually sounds really good. That sounds like a good dog. They're pretty smart. I like smart dogs, but here's the deal with smart dogs, you got to give them things to do. Okay. That type of smart. If you have a German shepard, like people have German shepherds and they don't exercise them and they don't, they don't give them tasks and have fun with them and play with them. If you don't do that, that thing's going to get bored as fuck. And that's a big ass animal. And how many people do you think go with the, with the technology, with the H, how easy it is to do a little research on a dog and find that out.

Speaker 3:          02:43:33       I bet there's so many people that get it, like they're there at the time in their life when they don't think about it, which I understand they're going to go get a dog now. Some people do, but other people wouldn't. And just get a dog. They have no idea. No one ever told him that huskies. So they just get a husky and then they learn like, you know what I mean? Like now I can see that 40 years ago, but now you would think you would, but there's still people. I have friends that got a Husky Friends of friends and they were to I, we were camping and they told the story and I'm like, oh they had no idea they went and just got a husky. What does this video, right. You know, like by the way, do I take that for granted or did you know huskies or they want to be working.

Speaker 3:          02:44:05       So if they're not, they do destruction. Is that something that most people know I was true today? Most people would know that. Fuck up. You're a little dig out your yard. Yeah. Mike, this guy just said lets his German shepard play with his bare notice I said Brenda friends, I didn't want you to think all my friends were idiots. Yeah, look at this. Bear sends a great video. Have you seen this video Jeff? Oh, it's amazing guys. Buddies with a bear and the dog hangs out with the bear too. Yeah, well that's all well and good. As long as the bear really super likes you and you were with it all the time. That's the thing about those things, kind of be with them all the fucking time, man. You gotta make sure they're well fed, you've got to make sure that they're super comfortable with you and yet still those bears will eventually, you know, occasionally rather turn on people.

Speaker 3:          02:44:48       I agree. You know, it's funny when we, you know, I always, this is my, my obsession with life and I always see examples of it. Every time I see something now I see an example. There's some people that would think putting a horn in that I agree by the way. Like just try to have some dignity to the animal. The San Diego Zoo, you used to be able to keep in mind, it's still a zoo. So that's the bigger argument. But when we were little, I learned this when we went back. They don't make them clap their hands anymore and wave to you, the bears. And I asked why. Because when, once, when I went with my parents, they did when we were younger. Then when I was an adult and I went, they didn't do it. And the pita said [inaudible] well, they already don't want them at the zoo now.

Speaker 3:          02:45:24       Well they're there. Can you give some dignity? Does, does that make that makes sense to me. It makes sense to me. Um, that you, uh, if you're going to a zoo, first of all, you should see an animal in a semi natural environment. I think zoos should have a minimum size requirement for big animals. The saddest things. When you see like a big animal and they were in a tiny ass fucking enclosure, that's scary. You know, that's, it's a prison, a public prison. Everyone you would agree to to. So even if the animal's happy, it looks like it's happy doing it. There's no reason to make him no reason, no reason to make fake trumpet. Here's my question. Who Fuck wants to see it? Clap. Why do you want to see a bear clap? You fucking Weirdo. It's a bear. You know what? Want to see a bear. You should see that bear wandering around the woods and its natural environment. Anything else? It's human beings imposing their own power over this

Speaker 2:          02:46:10       animal. And then all the crowd reveling in the fact

Speaker 3:          02:46:13       bear just clapped on its own. Who would give a fuck? It's the idea that you tell the bear to clap and look the big giant furry killer, but goes to the bidding of the intelligent man. Yay, we win again. That's what the celebration is. And everybody cheers at seaworld cause you've got this majestic fucking Orca. So the reason to jump for fish, the reason that I think this is what happens a lot with people. And you know what? When I always talk about this, I always think, am I saying I'm perfect? No, but I hope I fucking grow. I tried to be, you're being honest about your opinions on things, but not saying that you're perfect. I'm not saying I'm perfect, but it could sound like it. I guess if you listen to someone for a while thinking, oh he's a try, I fucking at least try and I make mistakes.

Speaker 3:          02:46:49       So the question isn't that people when they go to sea world, cause I think a lot of people go this I just went and I didn't think, no, no, no. We're not asking you to judge yourself when, when you went, when you went, that's who gives. You didn't think about it. Now, once you're educated, right, I went to sea world. I didn't think about it. I wasn't a bad person. I'm not going to hold on to the rest of my life that it's okay cause I did it. Cause if I admit that it's wrong, I admit I did something wrong. No, it's not wrong until you have knowledge. Right. So that's what the seaworld thing, going back to that or this, the Peta, you know the same people. We're probably going, oh they're just waving. But Nah, now you think about, do you want that fucking bear to ride a bike? Yeah. And I watched it the first time and liked it, but I was young. I didn't know. But you have to ride a bike. It's one thing if you have a bear and you teach that or ride a bike and it loves it and it's like, where's the bike? You know? But when you're making them do it for a fucking show, you know, it's like, come on man. Yeah. When you think about it, and again, I went to video, I'm sorry,

Speaker 2:          02:47:42       but did you ever see the video of the bears and monkeys and they're going around, they're riding bikes around a circle in Russia and the monkey falls and the bear attacks it and they can't get the bear off the monkey. The bear kills the monkey in front of the crowd. Do you ever see that bear bear attacks? Monkey?

Speaker 3:          02:48:01       Can I take, why do I think, although I know my, I wouldn't want my child to see that so, but my instincts were to go good. Well He,

Speaker 2:          02:48:07       you can't count on bears to do what you want to do all the time that you can count on them if you train them to be nice to you, if you feed them and train them, you could count it. But that is a wild motherfucking animal with a hair trigger idea of survival and death built into its DNA and it's ready to explode at any fucking dangerous situation. And if it thinks a person is threatening it's life or if it thinks something is violating its instincts to avoid, look at this bear. The bear is on a bike.

Speaker 8:          02:48:36       Yeah, the monkey see the monkeys in front. The monkeys in front of the bear scooted ahead a little bit cause it might take a few minutes. So the uh, monkeys running and then the bears running with the monkey falls and the bear falls on top of the monkey and gets pissed and just goes after the monkey there. These are tearing the monkey apart in front of everybody and they can't get them off the monkey. They're like, stop, please stop. Please stop. They're pulling the monkey. They're pulling the bike in. The bear is just fucking this monkey up. It's a big bear and they can't do shit. They're trying to pull the monkey out of his hands are out of its mouth, but it won't let go. It's just mauling this monkey in front of everybody freaking out. But that's nature, man. This bear feels like he'd got attacked by the Monkey. The bear is not understanding that he was on a bike and the monkey was on bike. Now they pulled the monkey out, but it's dead

Speaker 2:          02:49:29       parks than monkey is just minding his own business doing. Everybody tells him to do, but the bear thinks that the monkey attacked him. He doesn't. He knows what he's like, why did I get hurt? All this fucking monkey like you get attacked me and so he just goes after him.

Speaker 4:          02:49:42       I think I feel good when I see it obviously not because of the monkey cause I think.

Speaker 2:          02:49:45       Oh okay. Maybe that will remind people. Yeah, they're fucking bears the same old thing. We think every time we see that stuff, that's a county thing to do to take an animal and in prison it like that. It's not a bad thing to do. Look at them in the wild. It's not a bad thing to do to manage their numbers in the while and including like wolves and bears and you got to kill a certain amount of them, especially if there's a lot of people in the area. You have to keep populations down. It's important mountain lions too. It's a big one, but there's, there's, that to me is not nearly as cruel. It's taken them and sticking them in a fucking animal prison so we can gawk at him. That shit should be illegal. I take my kids to the zoo, but I want to say right now I'm a hypocrite.

Speaker 2:          02:50:20       Take them to the Santa Barbara Zoo. It's a beautiful place. I love it up there, but the reality is it shouldn't exist. It shouldn't. If the very least you should have some gigantic walled in preserve where you could travel through their ranks, undisturbed like in some sort of a camouflage tube, but they should be able to hunt. The animals should have a natural ecosystem. We're completely dominating their ecosystem and forcing them to exist in an unnatural paradigm. The paradigm of cold food being slid in a tray under your door and you have massive predatory instincts of thousands of years, millions of years in fact of DNA in your body. And you have these natural reward systems that you uh, you don't understand. You don't have language and context, you just have these natural reward systems beat in and you're told to ignore them.

Speaker 4:          02:51:05       You know, you just sort of, whether this could happen or not, but bigger things have been built, you sorta just explained something that could happen. Like there's this thing obviously with technology to get it moved through this area silently would be easy camouflage, you know, it looks like and you get inside and there's windows that are one. And then if there's some way you could let all that happen and what could you charge then to tape this thing through their, first of all, it'd be be much more maybe, maybe, maybe that could be, you know, but I liked what you said about you. You got to go to the zoo because like the opposite of that is, okay, I'm going to take my kid that do. So now I'm going to just make pretend that it's okay. It's better to just say, yeah, I'm doing it, but it's fun.

Speaker 2:          02:51:42       Certainly hypocritical because I'm contributing to the problem.

Speaker 4:          02:51:44       Yeah. And I do the same thing, but I think admitting it is at least not disrespecting the people that are fighting the fight. And we know they're right. Like I think one thing going is bad. The next level, and maybe I'm saying this to make me feel better because I get ultimately don't go don't, but I think there's another level of, there's people out there. You are too lazy. You know their fight is right. You're a little too lazy or selfish and you don't listen, but don't fight them. Don't call

Speaker 3:          02:52:06       them idiots. Just go. They're fighting the right fight and I'm lazy, right?

Speaker 2:          02:52:10       Yeah. I'm certainly selfish. I'm selfish more than I am lazy because I want my children to experience these animals. That's why I go. I think it's fascinating for them to see gorillas and know that that's a real animal right there and it freaks them out. But seaworld, you w would you take no. Well, I think even gorillas and chimps, I think it's gross. I think all that should be illegal, but it's legal and it's there and I'm not sure how much impact. I know this, believe me, folks who were, who are or you're writing right now, she was hypocritical flock. These animals are living beings. I agree with you 100% but it's still there. It's there. The zoo is there. Do I think it should be there? Absolutely not their thing. It should be illegal. And should I be boycotting it? Most likely if it was just me on my own, I wouldn't go.

Speaker 2:          02:52:50       But in this situation that I am in right now and having children who enjoy looking at the animals, I think it's important first of all, that I take in there and I tell them that there's something wrong with this. I tell them that I don't like it. I tell them that I think that animals should be free to live in their own environment and I think that this is way worse than being, I think an animal. I mean obviously they wouldn't have this choice, but if they had a choice between living in the wild and being taken out by a Predator or living in a fucking cage, just staring at people that stare at you, I would take my chances with a wolf, you die. It's quick and it's the natural way. This is nonsense. Giraffes are not supposed to die of old age. It's supposed to get taken out by lions.

Speaker 2:          02:53:30       All right? That's what's supposed to happen. It sounds fucked up, but that's what they always cause no one could defy that. That's just flat out nature is what it is, is what it is. Cause ELLs or fast for a reason because they taste delicious and there's a bunch of animals that want to fucking chase him and eat him. I mean, it's really simple. It's really sent. But to put them in a cage and say, oh, this is where the judge cause L's live now. This is crazy. They can't even run. They're stuck in this little tiny spot and they're freaking out and they always think someone's going to get them, but no one's going to get them ever. I even feel bad for goldfish. Yeah. Golf Fisher. Stupid as fuck though. They barely have it. Even brains. This bitch is winding down Todd glass. You're an amazing mother fucker. You're hilarious comedian. And it was, thank God we finally did this.

Speaker 3:          02:54:08       Yeah. Um, this was, this was a, I never get to do this ever. So do this anytime you want. No, but I mean it's like you, you know, it's fun to do a podcast where you get to do something you don't do in years. And I was able to let go. That was an amazing, uh, one hit upon. I took her to this. That lasted the whole time. About 10 minutes ago. I felt myself coming down and that was just a very enjoyable conversation. I really enjoyed it too. You're, you're a very thoughtful guy and I think you, you, uh, confused that with a over analyzing. I think he just thoughtful. Well, I appreciate that. I really enjoyed talking to you, man.
