Speaker 1:          00:00          The joe rogan experience. There's a movie I saw the other day, uh, about these two prostitutes from Amsterdam and there the roads, they were like the oldest prostitutes ever. Oh. And they said that they saw more than 355,000 clients to date. And they're, they're twin sisters. And there's, uh, uh, oh my God. Are you kidding me? Yeah, they just retired the other day, but there's eight. Just retired. Yeah, there's a, there's a Netflix, a movie all about them. Uh, documentary, uh, he's a Scooby Doo van for sale on Craig's list. Oh, there's a lot of those because of the law. When the movies came out, this could be doing one, two, and three. They had a bunch of these like advertising vans. So these ladies, these ladies. But anyways, it was a really interesting, uh, uh, documentary. I can't think of the sea, see if they say what it is, but they're, their name is Louise and Martine focons in their sisters that had been prostitutes for over 50 years. And, uh, it was the most creepiest documentary because they talked about how they didn't really want to do it anymore. They were kind of, you know, like, I'm an old lady, I don't want to do this. But then they had to because they had no other choice because they had no money. And uh,

Speaker 2:          01:14          you said I was a little tired. That's her quote. I, those are the [inaudible] I was a little tired, tired. Luis told as it happens, host Carol off in an interview that aired March 18th. The sister said that old age and arthritis where the main reasons for their retirement, and I've written about their exploits in the new book called the ladies of Amsterdam.

Speaker 1:          01:40          That's how they would walk down the street. And the documentary was kind of cute. Does cause there was so such an old ladies, you know? Oh my God. But it was awesome. Really disturbing. They look like dude's pretending to be old ladies. Like one of those theme movies like Benny Pills. Yeah, they'd look Dustin Hoffman. Yes. Yeah, they do.

Speaker 2:          01:57          Yeah, they look fake. Yeah. Look to Benny Hills and dresses. Their body just becomes like a battleground and all the Siv, HIV, STD, syphilis, gonorrhea, aids, it all just battles it out together for dominance, see who wins. And meanwhile she stays healthy. She's tastes healthy cause they didn't attack each other. They don't even go after the immune system. I mean as if though your kids, that's when it would really gross you out. Imagine if you had a kid with a chick and then you weren't really that into it and you kinda like kept away from her and laughed and didn't pay child support and she went into property and then he found out many years later that your kid retired as the oldest prostitute ever in Amsterdam. You know, man, you want to talk about regret at someone's a little girl. That's someone's, a little girl. That was someone's little cute baby that was so sweet and everything she said was adorable. Oh my goodness. Look at her. She's so precious. Next thing you know, it doesn't really end that well. This story. Well, how did it end? Well, do you really want to hear the end? Yeah. Well they became a prostitute for 50 years and soc 350,000 decks.
