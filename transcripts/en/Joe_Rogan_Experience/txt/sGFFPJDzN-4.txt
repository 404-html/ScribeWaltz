Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Keep it together. Keep it together so hard to keep it together. We just got to keep it together. It's so important to keep it together. I know it's hard as fuck to keep it together, but key pay together. Before we get started, we've got some shows coming up. Brian Red Band and Tony Hinchcliffe or making them wait Serrano. Be careful up there. He fucks cause that's Canada or I design America. He's gotta be respectful. Don't go up there. Thrown your fucking waste products in the street. Be Kind, be gentle. Canadians are awesome. You're gonna love Toronto.

Speaker 2:          00:00:35       Toronto. Very different than a Vancouver.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       Yeah, I think, uh, well they're both awesome. You know, cannabis, like one of my favorite places to perform. I'm doing a Winnipeg this weekend. Wow, that's awesome. It's fucking, they're strong. They're so fun. They're, they're like, they're like, just like regular, like American crowds, like a really good American crowd. Jazz that up like 5%. That's like a really good Canadian crowd. They're like super enthusiastic. They're awesome. Sweet. And that place that you're going to in Toronto, they may or may not smoke marijuana while the show was going on underground cafe and you may or may not not be able to see people in the audience because you're performing in the fucking clouds.

Speaker 2:          00:01:13       I heard that. I think it was Esther or somebody went there and they don't smoke weed and they said that they got so stoned that they was having a panic attack while just doing comedy there.

Speaker 1:          00:01:22       Absolutely no doubt. 100% the, there was no air left in that room. You were only breathing we'd wow. It was insane. I had never been so high in my life. There was no way or they, there was nowhere else to go. I'd hit the back of the high wall like, Oh, here we are. It's like this is the wall. This is the 300 foot or

Speaker 2:          00:01:41       I'm not going to, I'm not going to do good. I, this is going to be scary for me. I'm not going to be fine. Just don't get too high before you go up there. That's the thing. Just don't get too high before you go up there. Wow. Or do it get high like really early in the day. So you're comfortable around like five, six o'clock. You better build up your tolerance. Yeah. Go over your notes or just stay with the stone is set everywhere. I'm just making words a great though. Great. You're doing three days up there. July 11th to 12th and 13th. It's a great spot. The people that run it are super cool. All that stuff about weed. I made that up. It's not even going on down there. I don't worry about it. Uh, but it's a, you're going to love it. And Tony Hinchcliffe we've taken with you.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       It's fucking hilarious. Really Funny Dude. He's a, he's really coming up. We started that new podcast with him, the Hinch piff notes and man, we've only done two episodes, but I really see this becoming big. It's like, if you know what it's like, it's like American idol for, uh, open makers. Yeah. You're doing some weird shit with him. Tell me what exactly what you're doing. What we do is we have a show and like whoever does they, the comedy store has this sign up sheet where like every Sunday or Monday you sign up to try to do three minutes on stage and there's tons of people that, you know, it's pay $20 parking. They try to just get there three minutes standup in and they don't get on. So we take those people that like the people that didn't make the standup and we let them sign up on this list and then they get to do one minute in front of me, Tony and whoever the special guests for the week is. And then we pretty much either do this thing called tag it or Faggot, but spelled with a Ph. Uh, but we changed it to valid. That's really rude. No thought for your very first time

Speaker 3:          00:03:20       tagged with the p h a g thing. That's like the whichever career I think limit first of all guests. You named that. Right. Okay. And uh, second of all, you didn't run it by any gay friends first? No. No, but we changed it this week to bag it. Just because everyone got nervous. It's unnecessary in this day and age. Fag is unnecessary. It's too bad cause it was cause it was awesome. We got to let that go. You know why we've got to let it go. We got to let it go. Sort of in unity to our gay friends cause we don't really give a fuck if someone's gay. I mean we really don't. So like if you're, you're saying like something homophobic just cause it's cute and fun to do. If you really don't care if someone's gay, it's like you, you're doing yourself like a little bit of the service. You're getting lumped in with something that you don't agree with.

Speaker 2:          00:04:07       It's absolutely a, a poop joke. You know, I'd, it's like a cheesy dumb joke, you know, you would say in high school. So we changed it to bag it but last night and what we do is we pretty much sit there and they do their joke and then we either help them like, like that's a good joke. Right? You know, here's some tags for it. We try to tag it up for him or we just tell them to bag it and get to get the fuck out of area. And we kind of like almost do it in like a roast kind of way. But like last night we were there and this guy came up and he's like, and he was dressed up as iron man and he was just came up to us and goes, I'm a huge dose squad fan and I wanted to come here and show and hang out with you guys. So He's our nut now our new security guy. Like I like getting the people off stage.

Speaker 3:          00:04:44       It's not a fucking outfit. Yeah. First of all, he's like part Ironman Park. Captain America. Yeah. Look, it has a microphone thing in it that's out into battle against anyone who would threaten our way of life. All mine.

Speaker 2:          00:04:57       God, it was so ridiculous having him on board because he was, he ended up being really funny too. So like he would like, you know, give him chime in on some of the comics, but it's, it's the first episode drops this week, uh, on iTunes

Speaker 3:          00:05:09       can go to get death squad.tv and you can find the, uh, how to get tickets for the Toronto Gig. Yeah. Uh, we're also brought to you by hover.

I've used it myself to register websites and um, their, their user interface is very intuitive. It's super easy. I'm not that technical when it comes to the Internet. I'm not like that. Like, um, I'm not that proficient. I fuck up a lot of feel like I'm always calling Brian. It's like, what am I doing? What's wrong? Like, what's wrong with my fucking phone? What's wrong with it? I, I don't, I don't know

We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com and what a shock because the fucking CEO of on and is here today. Ladies and gentlemen, International World Traveler, psychedelic explorer, huge cock. That's what I hear. Well, well easy, easy. There is no need to, huge is a rude word except when I do a Bogo then it shrinks to the density of Pluto and a small diamond, but it's t pressing his dick hole. How dare you. I don't think that be effective. Maybe it would imagine if you found that was the best way to do it, just pack it in there like a musket tastes like watermelon. If you could get it like, because there's some drugs that people do take Ainsley and they actually enjoy it.

Speaker 1:          00:07:40       Like there's a girl named neuro soup and she did a, a a piece on youtube where she was talking about, it's kind of like a billion hits because she's talking about taking Dmt, Anal Lee, that she took DMT and she put it in her ass. And she was one that was in that vice story, that Hamilton Morris vice story where he was talking about how her boyfriend was his gigantic cocaine dealer, an ecstasy dealer. Wednesday, your Hamilton Morris and version was balling. That's his real voice, man. Don't hate. But this chick that had this greatly detailed vivid video about her putting, um, DMT in her ass and it was just fucking super intense ride with the devil.

Speaker 4:          00:08:21       Yeah, I went to have watch somebody go somebody into your bloodstream. My parents talking to aliens that an electronic music conference and I do not endorse or recommend this behavior whatsoever, but I watched the girl who said she couldn't get high from ecstasy anymore. She takes one and she puts one in her mouth and goes under her little Tutu and puts one in her ass at the same time. And it's like, I hope this works. Oh my God, I hope this works. Did she at least break it up before she wrote in her answer? She crunched down with their butt and try to slowly it into a fine powder, dissolving it with the natural juice and what? Yeah. Why wouldn't you start with your vagina first? Cause it's definitely easier to get juicy in there if you just found out that you think you're an asshole and brain best thing ever for cracking wallets like you like this.

Speaker 4:          00:09:09       No Way. My ass has no strength. There's no, but really you put a wall, nothing in there and it just destroys it and you're like, wow. Have you ever tried to squeeze it on your finger? No. No stick things in my ass, but a doctor did. Once I got, I had a test once in a doctor looked up my ass with his finger. I'm like, wow, I've thought a colonic and that's a little frightening. Yeah, that seems like a bad idea, right? He had a stick a pump up up your stomach and you're going to shoot water in there and clean yourself out. Including all the good stuff. Like there's a whole civilization going on inside your stomach. It's true. And you're going to blast water through your, your shit hole and then they're gonna examine your poop and you're going to discuss what your diet is.

Speaker 4:          00:09:46       Whoa, watch it. Go through the tube, see salad. But you said excavating. It's like archeology, you know, you see stratosphere, like layers of the earth dude, I different meals past years past, you know you got the red layer, the brown layer, the chain breaks off. Just different parts that you see from not just your last meal but many meals before, how often you need to do it. But that's what I saw going through the two. Did you feel good after he did it? The very first one I did. I've done like a three or so. The very first week.

Speaker 4:          00:10:21       It's a good excuse. No, the very first one I did felt like a slight religious experiences. Like amazing. Like I walked out of there like feeling light and like I was cleanse and then the other ones were mostly just uncomfortable and I didn't really notice very much reward leading me to believe that colonics are good like once every five to 10 years or so just to kind of in case there's some shit hiding out in some nooks and crannies cause the digestive tract as all these little spots and nooks and crannies and little areas where waste can collect and start actually really rotting, coming septic. So it's good to get that out of there every once in a while. That's my theory. I'm just see bullshit on at Penn and teller bullshit. What'd they say? What'd they say? They pretty much just went to all these doctors and like, and you know, had they got this guy on Craig's list that was broken in the aid that you gave him for like $300 to do it and let them film it. Oh my God, this poor guy. So then they went, all the doctors and their doctors are like, that's, it doesn't, nothing.

Speaker 4:          00:11:25       That seems silly. There seemed to be not paying attention and they let you watch it. Maybe that's the next product we'll go with on it. On a colonic. Colonics and douchebags actual literal dude. Apparently I'm a lot. There's people that will take a Epsom salts and they drink it in a glass, like a couple tablespoons. Does that go through you like rocket fuel? That's what I've heard. I've heard it's just really uncomfortable. Gassy, uncomfortable, very diuretic. Don't rely on that either. But is it to have a benefit? Is there something to clean your shit hole out? Yeah, I mean if you're doing a cleanse right and you need to, you need to open up the channels. Have you talked to be doing a cleanse is chances are you're a douchebag if you're one of those fucking guys and cleansing, cleansing. I'm getting very feminine cleansing.

Speaker 4:          00:12:10       Yeah. But if you are doing some kind of fast or some kind of protocol where you are trying to detoxify your body, it's good to open up the channels of elimination. One of the channels of elimination is shit. Right? So it's good to actually, cause you will get kind of constipated because you're not feeding your body with a bunch of food. So it's good to actually push that out. But usually better than Epsom salt is going to be oxygenated magnesium. There's a couple of brands like mango seven, um, and that ozonated magnesium. There's a couple of different types, but it'll actually help really push that through with a kind of a good,

Speaker 3:          00:12:44       does the absence salts contain magnesium? It does, right? Maybe that is the mechanism perhaps you thought to, yeah, because different form, one of the benefits of the tank is that you absorb Epson salts or your skin. So the fact that you don't have a tank I'm going to, right. We've got to get you on that shit. That's correct. At this point. That's preposterous. A great, uh, magnesiums like the thing that we all need, what we, none of us really get enough of. Yeah. Magnesium, zinc and magnesium. Yeah. A little lot of minerals. Actually. The, remember that guy that was around dead doctors don't lie. And he was, uh, explaining like cheerleaded minerals and he was saying that mineral deficiencies, the reason for like all these issues in farm animals that we fixed a long time ago, cause we just give the mineral rich diets and we add minerals to their food. But we don't add, I'll add minerals to people's food. He's like, do you know, few people take mineral supplements? And he was like talking about all these different deficiencies, calcium treating osteoporosis. And it was pretty fucking crazy shit

Speaker 4:          00:13:42       convincing because there's not as much mineral in the soil. I mean they're replanting over and over again in the same fields. And that's where I, vegetables are coming from constantly replanting. So the minerals in the soil are mostly from the fertilizer. What they're actually putting in, well, they're not necessarily putting in complete full spectrum balanced minerals back in the soil. So the, a lot of the food we eat don't have the mineral content that we originally had if you were farming in a really sustainable way and rotating around getting new soil and things like that solution. Now easiest one is the Himalayan salt, 84 trace minerals right there and the salt. And that's, you know, one of the reasons why salt was so prized back in ancient times is that that's the best source for your mineral. The easiest source at least. There's a lot of good sources,

Speaker 3:          00:14:25       but this is a really good reason to forgetting Himalayan salt, right? Because that's like it's salt that hasn't reached any, there's been no pollution, I'd say.

Speaker 4:          00:14:33       Yeah, it's like a hundred million years old. So all of the pollution that's in the world now, everything that's in the air, everything that's in the water and the fish and all that shit that wasn't around back a hundred million years ago. Just Tara doctorals and some ancestors roaming around on the ground. So there was nothing to pollute the salt at all. No oil spills, none of that. So it's a very pristine deposit. That's fine. You put like a little in your water in the morning. Yeah, I do it intermittently. I actually like it at night and I was, I had a pretty dramatic incident where I, for like a week I started going through, I was uh, I was taking very demineralized water, like highly filtered water just cause it's a water filter that out. So then I was starting to hear my pulse in my ears when I would go to sleep and I was having trouble sleeping and they're like, well it could be a mineral deficiency for your adrenal glands.

Speaker 4:          00:15:21       And I was like, okay. He's like, yeah, they're like, take a bunch of salt before you go to bed, Himalayan salt before you go to bed. I did that and made a dramatic difference. So now for me, I take more salt at night before I go to bed and I sleep a lot better and I don't get that. It wasn't so much that I was, it just, I could hear my pulse in my yeah, years and I felt like a real deficiency. What would cause that? Did they explain the mechanism has a mineral deficiency. The adrenal glands need, you know, need the minerals to function at an optimal level. Like most of the systems in our body. So all kinds of systems need the minerals. Minerals are kind of the foundation of what makes us up, makes everything run really well. So were you drinking distilled water?

Speaker 4:          00:16:02       Is that what highly highly distilled water Kangen water, it's called Kangen water. It's just happened to the filter. Completely mineral devoid water at my house, you know, and I was eating good vegetables and stuff, but the vegetables don't have all of those minerals. And I was, I would occasionally sprinkle salt on my food, but I wasn't really paying attention to my salt intake, you know? And then I tried to regiment it and actually supplementally take it and it made a huge impact for me. Wow. Yeah. Cause you have to be careful with that. I mean all these water systems, I mean this is a fancy water system. I'm not endorsing it by any means. It's just good to take everything out. But it takes too much out. You have absolutely no minerals and electrolytes in your water if you're using one of these highly filtered system.

Speaker 4:          00:16:44       So adding a pinch of that salt back in is going to be important because that's your body runs on. That's interesting too. But what about like, um, springwater? Is that the best water to get a new body? Like there's a difference between spring water and like what is the difference between a spring one and like Disani and all those, like those are filtered waters, right? Right. So that's, they're basically taking water from anywhere. It can be as dirty as can be and they're just running it through adequate filters to take the bad shit out of it. And that's distilled, that's filtered water. Now springwater is actually filtered either through the ground, which is the best way to do it. Like a volcanic system where the water naturally filters to the lava that comes out. And that's going to collect all the minerals through the earth that you really need. And that's going to be the best way to do it. Yeah. My friend's place in Colorado has a a, well yeah, and she gets it. She gets it like right from the, well, it's incredible. It's like spring water. Totally. So like you've free springwater, so you probably need half the Himalayan salt or a quarter or maybe you don't need any, I don't even know how rich that water is, but you'll need way less than if you're constantly drinking filtered distilled water. Yeah. They pull water right out of the fucking ground

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       up there, man. It's nuts. I mean that's where they're getting their water. They're getting free springwater, just pulling it out of the ground just like drank tragic. I get some water here. Yeah. You know, try it. Should I go into studio city? Dig it up. Fuck at a hole in the ground and Fido, not going to be good. Suck it out with a straw. You're dead. Even some places out in the hill country in Texas we have wells and you bring it out. It smells like eggs, software. So there's no way you're going to stomach drinking that that's so nasty. And Himalayan salt that you have on on it.com is to prove too. So it's what she proved. You proved. What does that mean? Oh Shit, baby. Oh, it's kosher. Is that what they call it? Proved to me make that up. I think a rabbi has to bless it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:31       Do it a little bit. Well, no, I think and not punch parameters like not like you can't like rub his balls on it, you know, none of that. Yeah, it definitely not. He has to know that the process has been observed. Yeah. Do you have like real strict rules? I think like what's slaughtering animals especially. Yeah, very specific rules. But what's kosher and what's not, but you know it's not kosher bacon, so kosher. Stupid. Okay. That's ridiculous. Okay. If you don't, if you don't like Bacon, you can go fuck yourself for real. I was thinking about that and I kind of feel like the Jews are pretty cool with masturbation. I'm pretty cool with sex. I feel like they had to pick something that they get. They get outlawed and say foot beading and they were just, they got bacon. We could live without that shit.

Speaker 3:          00:19:15       Well, jerk off all day. We'll fuck whoever we want, but bacon, we're going to outlaw that. So people take our religion seriously and dirty salt you think and how much tricker gnosis pigs have pigs. The thing about pigs is that there's, they're omnivores and they, they're oftentimes are scavengers, so they'll eat like wormy food man. And you can get all kinds of horrible diseases if you don't cook their meat. Yeah. So I'm sure back when they did a shitty job of cooking meat and they didn't know what the fuck worms where they would eat that stuff and get really sick and possibly even die. Bacon back then was like rod dog or go in Africa. Yeah. I mean dangerous pigs would just be one going at your own risk. But it's tempting, you know, because it's delicious. Yeah. They didn't know what the fuck they were doing and those pigs are wild to just eat and fucking cadavers and shit and yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:20:02       But wild pigs are dirty. Franks getting rid of evidence. Yeah. Like that movie snatch. Right. We talked about that. Uh, this is not even a commercial anymore, but then install goes Himalayan salt. Yeah. Go get some, uh, if you haven't been to the fitness section on it, we got pretty much anything you need for a serious rigorous strength and conditioning program. We provide it all when you talk about stuff for functional strength, weight vests, battle ropes, kettlebells, steel maces and steel clubs, both of them, which are, they're excellent for developing like all full body movement and the kind of strength that you could really translate into any athletic endeavor or murder. While if you know,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       I really slow shot the Steel Steel Mason, the club and you're a really strong, uh, we, we also have jump ropes now, pull up bar, wall medicine, full home gym and you know, and really are functional stuff. Yeah. And two of the best DVDs we eventually, we'll make our own DVD. We promise you this, we promise you this. But for now, the extreme Kettlebell, a cardio DVD one and two by the fabulous keep Keith Weber, it's tough to keep those fucking things in office, right? We actually took over production. So we've got us covered. You can hammer us with us things now we're not waiting for oh, Keith. And they send them to us. He finally worked it out, right? Yeah, we worked it out. Is it possible to get those DVDs about was it was international incident every time we had to try and get them. Hope you're happy, Keith.

Speaker 1:          00:21:38       Keith, I hope he's happy. He's happy. He deserves it. That is a bad ass workout. Both of them, they're ruthless. So if you, if you've never done any kettle bells before, really our urge you to start slow, start slow. And if you can hire a trainer to someone who's Kettlebell certified to just go over the movements with you, you can work out at home, you can totally get, I do kettle bell workouts at home all the time, but the first couple of times you're doing it, it would be really smart if you're paid. Very close attention to technique and very close attention to your form and make sure you don't hurt yourself. We don't want you hurting yourself. Generally. We have a bunch of videos

Speaker 4:          00:22:18       from the a I KFF, which is one of our really cool new partners. They're, uh, one of the biggest sanctioning bodies for Kettlebell sport here in the u s and two of their top athletes are on there on the side as well. Given some instructional tips. If you try to find that on Youtube Penny stock or you can go to, um, you should be able to navigate to it from the kettle bells themselves, not the DVD. But if you go to the youtube page you can definitely check that out. And um, Ken Blackburn, Mitch Blackburn Rather Than Sun Mitch is like 165 pounds and set the American record for the um, the clean impress double clean and press was 72 pounds. Yeah, each cattle, he did it like 65 times in 10 minutes without putting them down. Oh, bolts on that. He's like 165 pounds, 19 year old kid. You can see him on the honor roll. Actually, if you look up Mitch blackboard, that's somebody, it just shows you what it is. I mean, and it's form these guys, their form is impeccable. You have, they're not wasting any energy at all. It was cool to watch them. Cool to learn from him.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       You know what's really fascinating about a lot of these guys just they don't look like, they're not like bodybuilder looking guys. It's like they have this incredible strength for the amount of mass that they carry around. Like you were saying, this guy is 160 pounds, 165 pounds. Jesus Christ. That's a tiny little fella. There's the guy, right? The fact that the guy that weighs 160 fucking pounds can throw two 72 pound kettle bells around like that. He was ripping the 90s up and snatch in the 90s saying whatever. That's an insane, oh good. What do you want me to do? Okay, you've got some shock hair. I don't know. Like for the average folk like you would have, you would struggle with a 35 pounder. Trust me, it's hard the first time you do it, it's real awkward. But what did develops, I am a fucking huge proponent of kettlebells.

Speaker 1:          00:24:07       Kettlebells. It would, it would, it gives me is like real functional strength, functional strength that just directly translates to Jujitsu. I noticed a big difference in my rolling when I got really heavy with kettlebells. Yup. Because it transferred my workouts from, oh today I'm going to bench, uh, tomorrow we're going to do squats and all that. That gets you stronger. But there was something different about doing it all together when you were doing like, you know like alternating cleans and clean press squats and he's crazy full body exercises. It's like you didn't just get stronger, you also got more fit. You'll also got like more endurance. You also got like translatable explosive energy.

Speaker 4:          00:24:47       Some of those other main lifts like bench and squat, they're really good for getting you bigger in particular, you know, and stronger in certain finite ways. But if you're talking about general functional strength, Kettle Bell is the clubs, the battle ropes, yeses. That's really going to get you to get the job done

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       and it gives you a balanced strength. And look, if you want to get crazy, I mean like a lot of people, like there's dudes that can squat 225 pounds easy. Like, I've met a lot of guys who can do that, but how many guys could do that with two 120 pound kettle bells, right? You mean tell me. You really can do that. You can clean and squat 220 pound catapults. You probably can't. You know you're going to wobble all over the place. You're, you're dealing with this weird thing that you have to kind of control them balanced with. He got to learn how to hold on to them correctly. You got a bill, this weird kind of functional strength. We are swinging these fucking cannon balls around and touching them on your forearm without snapping your arm. Yeah, it's manly shit. Folks, go to [inaudible] Dot Com o. N N. I t. Use a codename Brogan and you will save 10% off any and all supplements. Did Somebody Fart? Seriously? I didn't any natural dick pills coming soon. That was bad.

Speaker 4:          00:26:02       My old business, you know, the natural, the Dick Pills, we have those rock hard weekends, but we found out that the whole game and a lot of those pills is, you just sneak a little Viagra in it and then you get popped and then you sneak a little Cialis in it and then you get popped and then your third version is just pretty garbage. Right? I mean, once you get used to the paradigm of what those drugs can do, just forget it. I mean, you can take all the herbs you want and it's not going to really move the needle, so to speak. But you know, I mean, you can help support the systems in general, like with t plus. But as far as dick pills themselves, forget it synthesizes a fucking joke doesn't even exist. So there's no

Speaker 1:          00:26:37       like aunt boners or anything that you could put in there that just natural calling Ian boners is just by Agra Bro.

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       It's, yeah. And a lot of them, one's in the gas station actually work because they're putting like Chinese viagara and then, yeah. So it's like you'd think there, they're a real piece of shit. But you look at some terrible label on the gas station. It's like, I don't know, phaser laser hard five. And you're like, what the hell is that? But if you take it, it's like a little bit of Chinese viagara ridiculous. He's so ridiculous. Like why wouldn't you take the real critical drug? Well, you know what it is just like, let's just hope this one works because some are more powerful than others in anthrax. So you like lose all responsibility for what happens based on the luck of the draw. It's kind of like a job, but there's, I've found a couple of them that like you really take and it's the most, you're just boner, but oh, that's hilarious.

Speaker 4:          00:27:27       But it's last seven days. Well, I'm, it's the Cialis one. Hey listen, don't die. Please don't die. Uh, on a.com o n n I t use code name Brogue and save yourself 10% off any and all supplements. Brian experience, but hey, you never know until you try, you know? Yeah, exactly. This mother Fucker, when this Dick Pills, you believe this guy, I took two different brands last week. Why not? You would doctor and tell him your dick is bro, he will give you amazing drugs. I'm not saying that it's broken, but don't tell the doctorates broken. Did they have a test though? Like does he rubbing it and go like, you're lying sucks your cock for five minutes. And if you can think of dead puppies for five minutes, then he'll give you the pills.

Speaker 4:          00:28:26       They can't say no can they? There's no, there's no way for them to test the horse. They can't. They don't want to stimulate your prostate with a large finger death grip. And then if you get hard, they, they can't obviously. I mean, did you use, they're going to take your word for it. Why would you say that? You can't get hard. If you could get hard. Well, you wouldn't lie about that. What'd Ya, they don't, nobody breaks their Dick with that stuff. Do they? Can you possibly like break it so that you like, you can't get a boner without it. You know how like some dudes, they get addicted to those sign the sprays.

Speaker 4:          00:29:03       The biggest problem is a psychological addiction. You know, like the back when we were selling the rock hard that worked back at flashlight because it had flaggers yeah. Alison and or whatever it had it. And I don't know. Um, but back when it worked, there was people who would take it and they'd get, you know, they start off with a girl, right? And they'd be hooking up with a girl and they were like, oh my God, you're a god among men. And then they'd get that. And then if they didn't have it, you know, they would start to panic and then their brain would start to take action. Is the brain gets activated in the sexual act. Isn't it crazy how different you can get excited for one girl over another? Like there are some girls and we all know

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       them in your life where when you're around them, it's just like instant flagpole. And then there's other girls where it's just, it just for whatever reason they can look just as pretty, they can be just as nice. They can be just as attractive. But this is some freak connection you have with thinkers and people really do think so. Yeah, I think so. I think really what you're saying is kind of true. Like the juice essence is you have Zam Zam Isru how's you say that? That French dip. How's you, I never knew how to say that. They don't to that the restaurant. I know it on the other way where they've had like guys sleep in the same shirt for, you know, a few weeks or whatever and then they have gross smell the shirts and they'll be very attracted to one shirt and completely repulsed by another shirt.

Speaker 3:          00:30:33       Just by smelling the actual pheromones in it. I would lose that one for sure. I fucking stink going down. I eat too much meat. It's all coming out of my pores and shit. I don't know. I've smelled some of my clothes. My, uh, g the worst is Jujitsu because he take your, you, you sweat so much and then you take your shit off and you throw it in your gym bag and then you throw your gym bag in the trunk where it cooks cause it's 110 degrees in La. So you're driving around with your gym bag, cooking in the trunk and then you pop that bitch open and unzip it and it's just like ammonia and funk and, and that's where it, there's a lot of skin diseases that people get from that stuff because they don't wash those things enough and you're essentially, you're rolling around and microbes and bacteria and shit.

Speaker 3:          00:31:19       And the worst part is not when it's fresh, like fresh sweat is not that bad. Same as fresh urine. You can drink your own fresh urine all the time, but you're leaving me. I know, but if you leave a cup of that year and out for a day or so, don't fucking drink that. That's poison. It's like a breeding ground for further back to same with your gym clothes. I would agree that it's sound advice. Don't drink, drink. I think I'm going to ship into a meme. That's the next meal. You, Uncle Aubrey says don't drink old pis here it on it. We don't recommend drinking your own when it's old. So I'm thinking of trying to do an am Anita Mascara experience and I'm thinking I'm going to eat it and then drink my piss and see what's up. Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do. I would say no.

Speaker 3:          00:32:08       I said, well, I'll do it. I'll do it once and then I got to try it. I've tried everything else for real folks. This isn't a shamanically tradition. I know you're listening to this and you're like, there's no way these guys are serious. No. The true shamonic tradition is, it was explained to me, um, by uh, this Guy Jack Herer and he said that the idea is that you, you eat the, the drug, the plant mush. I'm an eater. Miscarriage. It's a very different, it's not psilocybin, it's some other type of what you're shooting for is Musk, Amal.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       You should, the active compound is Musk, Amal and what its Axon, a very different mechanism action. So the mechanism of action of emoney to miscarry, it actually acts as a Gaba agonist, so it's going to give you more of the neurotransmitter Gaba where it's still the [inaudible] the mechanism of action that there recently finding, which I learned a lot about at the maps conferences, mechanism of action of Siliciden is it's actually restricting blood flow to your default mode network, part of your brain, which is your top down control mechanism in your brain so that you're basically your mental cerebral filter that allows you to focus on the day to day mundane tasks starts to go to sleep and that happens to be the center that controls depression and a bunch of other things, which is why the clinical application is proving so important and impressive and and all these people, but that's a totally different mechanism of action. Then the Amanita miscarried, which is basically flooding your brain with more Gabba from what I understand, but the Musk, Amal is a tricky beast and it doesn't necessarily come out through your gut. However, once it gets processed through your kidneys and you piss it, it can be passed up to five times. They say through different people. So like I could Piss,

Speaker 3:          00:33:49       oh, you could drink it, you could piss give it to Brian. He could pick it and then Brian could give it to two other people and everybody will be high as fuck. Wow. That's what they say. How would they know? How would they know? Why would they find out? What are we doing with our lives? Which sitting around drinking each other's pice to get high. What are you seeing in fairies? Cock sucker watching Pluto.

Speaker 4:          00:34:13       He's supposed to be kind of like a little bit drunk and a little bit like a little bit high, like a psychedelic.

Speaker 3:          00:34:21       I only had one experience and it didn't work. You didn't drink your own piss. You got to commit. You've gotta go in. You can't just put the tip in. You gotta go miles deep. Huh? Is that how it works? You're supposed to just eat it and then drink your own piston and that's what gets you high. I mean

Speaker 4:          00:34:34       there's some ways that I think you can heat it and like lightly bake it. I don't know. But I think the sure fire way if you really want to commit is to eat it. Then drink your piss and then you can, you know,

Speaker 3:          00:34:46       but you feel so stupid. If it's getting worse. That's true. Sitting there with piss mouth, not high. I'm just thinking what kind of a losing him. I should just become a republican. Okay. I should just go the other way and get single malt scotch and sneaking some Cuban cigars and just become an asshole or renting a movie while I'm, but if it works it around eating mushrooms and drinking piss the fuck am I doing with my life. You got a dirty garage like I was going to get to that but I had to eat mushrooms and drink my own piss first. I'm a fucking real winter over here. I'm going to film it for, for all of the savages cause it is perfectly legal in the US.

Speaker 4:          00:35:24       Seminated Mascara is not a scheduled substance, so the reward if it works and it was awesome. It was pretty cool because we actually have something legal to do.

Speaker 3:          00:35:31       Yeah, and you're just going to encourage people to do that. No, I don't. I'm not. Look, please let me be the pig here. I don't

Speaker 4:          00:35:37       know. It could be terrible, but I'll let you know. You have to give one estate if it's bad. Also you have to have a [inaudible]. There's just like all with pissy mouth.

Speaker 3:          00:35:46       Self paid feeling the lowest of the low. I've never met anyone,

Speaker 4:          00:35:50       but he's had a good one. Is it a good a amnesia, miscarry or experience or not? Not. Not that I can remember anybody telling me about one. They've always said like, oh, it didn't work for me. Yeah, I met somebody who had a weird one and a not so good one drink, pee bro.

Speaker 3:          00:36:07       Weird and not so good, but there is piss drinking. So come on, join the party. That's a tradition around it though, you know? I don't mean that. We can all check each other's pissed by. Come on over here. He's got it all figured out. You just got to get a fresh is in to you and then you piss him. No, no, no. See that's not how it's done. I forgot to bring cups. We all thought how it works. I just pissing your mouth and is that what we do with you? That's straight from the spout kind of Potty we doing here the freshest way to get this in his ass mouth. We're going to work this out. We're going to get high as fuck disappeared.

Speaker 3:          00:36:44       It is exactly what he's trying to trick us in. You stumble upon this fucking party. You open up the tent door. What the fuck's Piss all over the place. Bunch of guys. The Kochs names. We just trying to get enlightenment but imagine if it does work and you get someone really high and they love it and then you could trick them constantly cause my piss. You just get a drink it yet here. That would pissed them off. One. It tastes like total primary care. Maybe some tea. Plus did you pack it like a musket? Why is Doctor Laser wearing lipstick?

Speaker 4:          00:37:25       We need to call doctor laser and ask him how many of those books behind him he's red cause it's driving us crazy. Yeah. I picture a doctor Lacey's get those old school books and nobody really reads. Yeah, he's old and he's read them.

Speaker 3:          00:37:37       I don't know the best way to answer. That's the best way it is. The finished that say, I don't know. I don't know. But he does have have

Speaker 4:          00:37:44       the brain surgery kit from Napoleon's fuel doctor. Pretty cool shots in his office. Yeah. They had a brain surgery big saw like it looks more like woodworking equipment, but like really finely crafted made woodworking equipment, things that like crack things, things that saw things. Oh my God. He debts and he actually uses it. Basically he has his patients walked by it and if they get queasy and they can't handle it, he's like, no, you're not the person for me. Cause he's a, he's a tinkerer. I mean he's going to go in there and actually cut your head and do some work. That's what his specialty is. He's done like 3000 open skulls or surgeries or something like that. Oh yeah, he's in it. He's no gee, he's cool. Holy Shit. You imagine working at 3000 brains. Yeah. What an power that

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       must be to those guys like that they, they can fix someone's brain. You know, I kind of agree. Kind of out your cancer and fix your brain and then send you back to how it live. A healthy life. Yup.

Speaker 4:          00:38:49       And he did it. I met one of the guys that he did that for. This guy, uh, is one of his patients and it's pretty remarkable. Went through there, did the brain surgery and then from, and that's actually how I met Dr [inaudible]. He did the brain surgery. Then he took a bunch of the ingredients. We have an Alpha brain too, and he recovered like way fast. This is of course just one story, but he recovered super fast and that turn Dr Lasar onto the potential for these herbs to work in conjunction with what he was doing on the brain. So that's how we kinda got got hooked up.

Speaker 1:          00:39:17       That's interesting. Did, did he ever talk to um, a Roman [inaudible]?

Speaker 4:          00:39:23       No, he hasn't, but we talked about that a little bit. I think it's actually in the long interview that we have up there. But um, yeah, the uh, the brain damage issue is pretty, it's pretty serious. I don't think he's ever been hooked up with bill though.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       Yeah. Well Roman Ascii, that's why he created that neuro one. That was the first nootropic that I had heard of. We were on um, um, no name and no name and Alice or Alison? No named Sarah and Nunu Sarah. No name rather on Alice radio. Yeah. Anyway. Um, and a no name African. His real name. I always called them no names. How weird is that? It's top cool guy. Anyway, he was training with Bill Roman house key and Bill Romanowski got them to start eating healthy and started giving him this neuro one shit. Well this is this a, it was like, it's a nootropic but it's also got like a little bit of caffeine in it. It's pretty interesting stuff and he developed it because of concussions. Yeah, makes sense. You've got to feed, feed back the brain when it's been deprived from getting swollen, swollen and pushed up against your skull.

Speaker 1:          00:40:23       It was had a good program. I was at a, a a neurological research center today and uh, one of the things that these people were telling me why they were there, I was there for this silly TV show. But there's people that take their kids there. Like if the kids are uh, involved in football and then football injuries and they're talking about it like these kids don't like 15, 16 years old and they just have these massive concussions and the father's like, well when can you get back in there? And the mother is like, is he going to be okay? Right. The mothers are concerned that their kid is getting really badly hurt and the fathers are, they want him to get back in there. It's weird. She's she, she was describing it to me like you know these situations that she's dealing with with these fathers and these kids and she's like, it's really creepy cause these kids don't know any better and they're just running their dads and like want them to get back in there like they get can cost. Like do you understand what that is? Do you understand what getting shut off is running on each other, colliding hands. Do you know whoa

Speaker 4:          00:41:22       man and the brain, there's so much more we still have to learn about it. Did you happen to see that thing on 60 minutes? Where there, there are people who are now able to control prosthetic limbs with their thoughts alone and did you see that? So basically they hook up these, they hook up these arms. Now the first, the first version prototype was they hooked the arms up and they actually hardwire it somehow into the nerves. But it's still their thoughts that can allow them, like they can shake hands with people just from like their brain telling this completely prosthetic arm to shake hands or like grab a ball. They can tell if a ball is hard or a telephone ball is soft just from feedback. It's bilateral. So it's not only they're squeezing but their fingers can give, uh, signals to their brain and let him know if what they're squeezing as hard or soft.

Speaker 4:          00:42:06       So it goes both ways. And then they figured out how to hook it up wirelessly so that they can actually control arms that are not even on them. And they can make those arms move just with their thoughts. So [inaudible] was on 60 minutes, like a week ago. I was fucking blown away. So like an Avatar type thing? Totally. Well not, but the first steps, like the big baby steps towards doing it with Wifi. Yeah. I mean I was, what is that? You remember that? It's the old experiments where they pretty much did, let me see. Oh, those rush. Oh, don't show me this. The dog had won. That shit ain't cool. I don't even know if that's real. Is that real? It's real. I don't want the Russians. It was a cool segment on, uh, on 60 minutes that it's literally like probably two weeks ago. Wow, that's, that's fucking freaky.

Speaker 4:          00:42:57       Pretty. I the, the crazy part to me was the fact that they could, it was giving him signals back from their fingers to their brain. That was, that was what really blew my, I mean, I guess the whole thing, did you know, just the fact that you think of this brain and thoughts is this kind of nebulous thing, but it's actually, it is a signal. There is some kind of electrical signal that they can get a machine program, a machine to receive and respond based upon a thought, a willful action to do something. It can pick that up. I don't know how the hell that happens and imagine if they can do that now. Imagine what a thousand years from now it's holiday. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:36       Probably will be able to just lie in bed and send our robot out to do everything we needed to do. Drive the car, you know, and we look through its eyes as it drives the car. We looked through, it says eyes as it goes to the supermarket, picks up groceries and we're just sitting at home, beaten off, beaten off, pretending with this person and the robot wanders through the fucking town. Does all your tasks come back home and you never leave the house? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:44:00       But imagine and then the application for sports, there's been a couple of movies like that, but you could go full. Let's say you created this kind of android creature that you can control with your mind. You could go full gladiator style with net and tried to sort and just have the most brutal. Obviously it'd be expensive because machines are expensive, whatever. But that'd be sweet. That'd be crazy. Bumper cars with a Ferrari. That's true. But you want to just take your fucking robot body torture people with it. Yeah, no, don't do that. But I bet you know what they

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       would do. You know like people play the sims. Yeah, I bet they would play like a real live version of the sims. Just let their human body go out there and interact with all these other robot bodies. You know, they take their body, they uh, they lie down and they look through the body or look through the eyes of this thing and then send it off. Like it's a little game and you send your robot out and the robot goes and fucks other robots and parties and your robots and animal and he drinks and drives. Cause he doesn't even live in the real world. He lives in this fucking crazy robot. Why don't we realize that's what's already happening? Where is the robot has turned us in and do a robot?

Speaker 4:          00:45:07       I keep on thinking simulation theory at the shit. Like, like your inner voice is actually you in the future. Like talking to yourself or something like that. Hit me. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:45:16       I think, I think everybody knows, especially when you're impulsive, fuck. Like I know you are and I am and you've been to sun. We all been a little bit impulsive and there's always, when you're about to do something and there's a voice, it goes, don't fucking do it, dude. You gotta listen to that voice always. That voice is always right. You know, there's like a

Speaker 4:          00:45:37       weird rush on the other side too that tells you not to do it. Like it's kind of feel good. You know, like when you're about to like if you're about to yell at somebody and you know you shouldn't do that, there's pretty much no reason everything.

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       Yeah, you're right. But when you get this kind of like energy that comes up and it feels like it's going to be good to release it. Yup. What the fuck is that? Oh, that's you protecting yourself. Well, why does it feel good though? It feels good because sometimes people need to be shown that their cons, an evolutionary response. The only way people learn, um, how to behave is by feedback. The way they learn how to be harmonious with their fellow brothers and sisters of the world. It's by feedback and when you're not good at it and you get bad feedback all the time and you don't adjust, that's like a sign of mental illness or stupidity or a, a lack of education or lack of someone explaining or your own personal critical thinking involving the way the world works. But for most people, as you get older, you get way better at communicating because you've gone through this feedback loop several times and he sorta stabilize it and you know what people like and what they don't like and you know how to get things off on the right foot and how not to, and it's like sort of easier to navigate.

Speaker 1:          00:46:53       And

Speaker 4:          00:46:54       he, there is, as you know, the key there is not to become completely enslaved by the feelings and thoughts and the kind of world around you and so that you're constantly living to please what the Toltecs would call it, the dream, you know, the cocreated world around you. So yes, don't be a Dick, you know, learn not to hurt people. But then at the same time, don't judge yourself according to all of these opinions that are generally wrong anyways. People don't necessarily always want you to be your best, you know, so you gotta find your inner path as well. Adjust

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       to guiding principle. It's a real problem for young people when they're dealing with haters, like the first haters in their life. You know, like it could be someone who's at work with you or someone you go on to school with or whatever, but it might be like the first time you like for someone like actively hates on you and that should can affect you. And I always say that it's like snake venom and that like Kevin, a little bit of Haider is like good cause you know how to deal with it. And then when, when you get a full blast of it, you're like, bitch, I'm immune to that stupid shit. And they're like, you've been bitten a few times. You understand it. Because people who don't have never been hated on before, like you see them get hated on, they're like, oh my goodness.

Speaker 3:          00:48:07       Just that wave of negativity that can erupt at any time on the Internet. That absolutely. I mean, you know, I felt that the first time, obviously in sports or whatever, you get these mild detractors, but you can always kind of see him. But then as soon as I stepped into the public eye, a lot of support, a lot of amazing people I've met and then a contingency of people who hate me just despise me. And I was looking at him like, why? What is the reason? Like I couldn't properly deal with it. I think I had to talk to many people I could and just kind of started a house. There's some people that are just going to be negative no matter what. But there's also, it's fucked up thing, but there's a truth in that. It's good to get your ass kicked. Yeah. And it's good to get your ass kicked on by the Internet too.

Speaker 3:          00:48:57       It's good. You know it, it doesn't seem like it's good when it's happening and it might be completely off base, but if it's right even a little bit, they're doing you a service because they're pointing out holes and you're tying up your game. Yeah. The pointing out holes in your game and it might be, it might be fair, but in nine might not be fair to you got to deal with that too. But that's part of the game that's part of you. And eventually, hopefully we all hope for some form of personal sovereignty where no matter what anybody says about you or how anybody describes you, it's better way of putting it. You know who you are. I know you're all right. And like all they're doing is exposing this need to detract from another person, just need to diminish another person. And she's a massive weakness.

Speaker 3:          00:49:46       It is. And you know, along and we've all been guilty of, uh, for sure. And along with that, it's also learning to take the praise. Not too seriously. Yes. You know, you can't get your tires last humped up and really buy into that whole thing and that'll lead you down a stray weird path of ego and feeding off that kind of energy that's no good either, either to tractors or too much praise. Just appreciate it for what it is, but really judge yourself by your own criteria. Criteria, you know, you know only you know really if you did your best, if you put out the maximum effort to try and achieve the result, and I only, you should be able to judge yourself toe. Yeah. Well if you're, if you're really objective and that's what we should all strive for. Writing like real objectivity. If he could really just fucking really look at what you're doing right or wrong and what you're enjoying about your life, what you're not, kind of get that bitch back on track sometimes it's hard to see yourself there, has to see other people, which is why a lot of the most fucked up people with the most fucked up lives always want to give you advice.

Speaker 3:          00:50:48       Yeah. I could wants to give you more advice than someone whose life is a mess. You know what you gotta do, man. You've got to get together with your girl and you've got to work this out. Okay. I know you don't want to work this out, but you've got to work and you're like, you really given advice on relationships. You crazy fuck head. They say that most of the people who get degrees in psychology are the ones who are trying to work out their own problems that most vehemently. I mean, I don't know, that's just hearsay, but that's, yeah. Yeah. I would think of psychologists would do the word of shit when they beat up. You know what I mean? Things. What is it? What is a sexual, uh, like one of those people that's like a sexual counselor. What did they beat it off to?

Speaker 3:          00:51:25       You know, do they be constantly analyzing? It can't be that much fun. Yeah. Right. Like how do they really totally cut loose. You're constantly thinking about whether or not she did as good. Up to objectivity is a real challenge. And I think one of the tools that both me and you have found, I've been different ways to break through that kind of mental patterning that gets you in trouble. So the tank is a great way to do it. And there's different meditation techniques that are great ways, but sometimes for us to really fix gold monkeys like myself and you and some other people when we just need something heavier to do it. And I think that's when, you know, I've gone to Peru and done the Iowasca or you can go, so hopefully somewhere safe and do a heavy psilocybin trip or find some way to actually get that part of your mind to really be objective, to kind of cut out all the bullshit and look at yourself with a true reflection.

Speaker 3:          00:52:18       Yeah. And I feel like there's certain doors that get open when you have those experiences and when those doors get open, it's like the whole world just takes a turn to the left. Like it's just not the same world anymore. Yeah. It's just not. And that's scary for a lot of people. Mad and it makes sense, but you got to really look at it objectively. And one of the things you got to look at is do you really like the world the way it is? I really scared. And taking a left turn into crazyville crazy film might not be that bad. Trust me, the regular world is crazy enough. Take a little trip down the Leprechaun lane and have a chat with the pixies and the other dimensions. It's not a bad idea. You got to know what the fuck is going on with your brain though. That's the problem. I would never tell anybody to do mushrooms or acid. And even though I have, I would never tell anybody to do any. Now today, knowing what I know would never tell anybody to do any psychedelic cause I don't know how the fuck their brain works. And then, so having an in something, I always kind of reiterate, having a really good guide is important. Someone who can not only ask you questions but kind of look you in the eye, analyze, um, what you should

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       or should not do. I mean, even the shamans down in Peru, part of the ceremony is before you get the Iowasca, they kind of get a sense of you, even if you can't speak the language, but they get a sense of being, you can sense crazy. You know, like, especially they're highly tuned to do that and they look at you and how's it going? Why some people get like a really little tiny, you know, third of a cup and then they go on their way. Because that's all that the Shamans, no, that's all they can handle. That's all they're in for. And then other people, you know, they'll fill that bitch to the brim and bid. I'll come back for more if you want it. That thick, thick, Brown bittery fiery Iowasca into your stomach. And you know what, I've never understood about the IOWASCA thing.

Speaker 4:          00:54:10       I must say. I'm going to have to do, I'll ask it to learn this, the tobacco thing, like what is it about the, is blowing tobacco smoke that activates some of the helices surgeons. I think it has to do with your actually your nicotinic receptors in your brain there. So there's something, you know, the DMT, the tryptamine like a stack, like you're stacking, that's these receptors. And this is swimming a little deeper than I probably can go, but I think it has something, you know, nicotine acts on certain mental receptors. Um, I think it's your nicotinic receptors and then tryptamine acts on certain receptors and somehow there is a, there is a synergy there. I haven't necessarily experienced that, but what I did experience, which was really weird, I have no very good explanation for this, but at the end of one particular ceremony, he smoked the tobacco.

Speaker 4:          00:55:01       The chairman smoked the tobacco Rustica which is different than the tobacco that we smoke. It's a different species of plant entirely. So Tobacco Rustica they smoked a big hand rolled cigarette from that and he like blew the smoke all over my body. I didn't feel anything at the moment. I was like, okay well I'm going to smell like this burnt plant. Cool. That's good. But he really like took care and put it on certain points and there's always some kind of purgative element to the IOWASCA. But that night I was like shitting and vomiting. Like I had, like there was some evil in my body that was trying to escape like the most violent purge I've ever had in my life. It was, and it went on for hours. I don't know where stuff was coming out of my body. Right. And I've, I've done, I watched it many times, so I know what the normal purchase this was.

Speaker 4:          00:55:53       They have outhouses or five times. Now the, you have a little toilet in your, in your place. Sometimes toilet. Uh, depends. Sometimes no. Sometimes that's just a hole. And sometimes you do have running water depending on where you go, but a lot of times they don't have toilet lids because you're not supposed to sit there and really enjoy, you're supposed to just hover, blow it out, and then wipe and put it in a basket. That's kind of the general program, but put it in a basket. Yeah. Cause it can't, they can't keep it in the toilet paper around the system. Yeah. Oh. But anyway, so there's some kind of cleansing aspect to it. It doesn't make any sense. The science, I don't know, I don't understand, but I know that, you know, they believe it's a cleansing ritual and it's certainly had that effect on me.

Speaker 4:          00:56:39       Wow. It just blows it out. And then that tobacco, he kicked it in something, something and he blew a lot of smoke, all of them. And then the next day he sees me and he starts laughing as I'm walking, like walking by him, he just starts laughing and getting, he asked me, you know, how was last night? And he's, I had someone with me, you can help me translate. And I was like, what the hell did you do to me? And he's just laughing and laughing and just pats me on the back and just keeps on walking. Like he knew that's exactly what he was going to do. Wow. So he was doing that just to get you to get rid of all the shit inside of you and throw up, cleaned it all out and then dose up the next night while dragging juice. Exactly. And the next night was the night that I went out and did the ride on that smuggled. That makes sense. Wow. He cleans your system out with some smoke stuff that they found

Speaker 1:          00:57:29       DMT and the pineal gland of live rats. Huge. Yeah. Huge. Yeah. This is Rick Strassman's Cottonwood Research Foundation. He, um, he, uh, just, uh, I mean this is something that they had speculated for the longest time. I thought it was a fact. I thought that they had known it was a fact until a Voodoo chicken on my message board was I think the first guy to, to clue me in to the fact that there's only like anecdotal evidence and he was like challenging Strassman on the message board because, uh, we know that the human body produces it. Then they, I guess they knew it produced, it was produced in the liver and the lungs, but this is the first time they can prove that at least in rodents it's in the pineal gland of alive.

Speaker 4:          00:58:14       Right? Yeah. I think when you, and when you're the way that, let's suppose it was the spirit mark, right? Let's suppose that hypothesis is true and it is some part of conducting the spirit from source into life and then back out. You know, let's say that there is some activation for that. Um, it makes sense that they wouldn't find the active concentrations in the dead Peniel glands because presumably it's purpose was done there. But to see it there in live, in live, um, you know, and while it's living I think is pretty cool, at least opens up that theory as a possible. One of the interesting things about taking the DMT was

Speaker 1:          00:58:53       the, the shortness of the trip and that's what the thing that people was coming on, that one of the signs that this isn't, this isn't a deadly drug, is how easy your body can get rid of it. Yeah. Your, your body can get rid of it and bring you back to baseline in 15 minutes. Like you're on this voyage to another dimension and then 15 minutes later your body's like, okay, okay.

Speaker 4:          00:59:14       Nothing to see here. We just get to clean this up folks. Yeah. What'd you cook? And just come in there with a broom and sweep up all the memories. What you just did.

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       Um, it, it seems like your body knows what to do with this shit. It obviously makes it, we know it makes it, we know that, but now we know that literally the third eye makes it and that's fucking crazy because that's, that's literally, I hate when I say literally because I shouldn't have said it that many times. That was my version of Ugh, that was literally, I should have said, ah. Anyway, they've proven that at least in rodents, this sacred of all sacred glands, this gland that the Egyptians thought was the seat of the soul, this gland, that eastern mysticism had forever connected with an eye of enlightenment, that that gland produces the most potent psychedelic drug known to man. That's fucking bananas. Pretty wild. It's nuts.

Speaker 4:          01:00:13       So many cross cultures too that you know, have, have some kind of belief in that center of your, you know, in that center of your forehead where your pineal gland is. It's pretty, it's pretty unique. And you know, the shamans down there, the interesting thing, you know, and I was reading Danieli Billy's book about creating your own religion and the distinctions between religion and you know, what both feel as like true spirituality. And some of it is, you know, it's not people telling you that it's, you know, feeling it, it's feeling that kind of activation or feeling what that feels like. And there's been times when I've been taking Iowasca where my most intense experiences come with a really intense buzzing energy that feels like not only that part of my head but starting there, the energy feels like it peels off my whole scalp starting in my third eye, middle of my forehead region, all the way to the back of my head, what they would call the Crown Chakra. And I don't know too much about chocolates but I know that that's what I felt from right here to the back of my head. It was like somebody peeled it off and it had an electric field and electric current over it. And when you get that feeling, you know you're in for some fucking cool shit that Redmond cool shit happen. Like that is the precursor to the craziest experiences of your, of your

Speaker 1:          01:01:28       spiritual oh yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's a language that you can only speak with people who've had some form of experience, something. Cause there's a lot of people out there and there's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with going through. I don't think there's anything wrong with going through your whole life as long as you're enjoying it. Why? Why have a psychedelic experience if you don't want to, if you don't feel compelled, I feel like if you feel compelled, give it a shot. But when you're having these conversations and you're talking about your shock, we're blowing open and putting yourself to dimensions and Phis, crazy flotillas or serpents flying above your head. I hear you. And I'm like, yeah, wow, okay, wow. Fucking hey. Like I know that really happened because I've seen some crazy shit myself. Not that it really happened. Not that it's really a snake, but, but my point that what people always go, well you know, if it's not real, okay then you're doing something really infant tile.

Speaker 1:          01:02:25       Okay. You're taking something that's allowing you to go into fantasy land for a little while maybe. Or listen, what if I could prove that it takes you to another dimension and the in that other dimension, you will see things that you could not possibly have imagined and you will experience novelty and honesty and wisdom in love in the purest forms possible, like their joy, like their waves hitting you where you're standing on the beach. If I could tell you that it was definitely taking you to another dimension, would you go then? I don't know. Maybe not, but here's what I know. Here's what I know for sure. If it took you to another dimension, you had that experience or if you just had that experience in your head, you still have that experience and I might as well have taken you to another dimension. It might as well because the same thing happened.

Speaker 1:          01:03:31       You saw the same shit. You felt the same things. You experienced the same things you saw at all. It might not have been real, but it might've been real too. It doesn't matter. You still experienced exactly the same way as if it did take you to another planet and you did ride around the rings of Saturday and your underwear. I mean, it really does take you to that place. Yeah. So it might be real, it might take you to that place or it might be all happening in your mind, but either way you experienced the exact same thing

Speaker 4:          01:04:01       and it lasts. And the results there, you know, that you get from it are actually, that was one of the cool things about going to the maps conference, which is the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies. They put on a conference in Oakland and they had all of the top scientists from all these different fields of research come and present their findings. So there's been over 80 patients, clinically dose with Psilocybin. Most of them in palliative care easing the anxiety of death towards the end of life. Amazing dramatic stories. You have psychiatrists in there who'd been working in this field for 40 years, seeing people and they, they're the ones running these, uh, these programs. And, well, first of all, the funny part is it's, it's a double blind trial, right? So it was on one case someone is getting placebo which is doing nothing and another case they're getting a heroic dose of Psilocybin.

Speaker 4:          01:04:50       And the research is like, one of the problems with the study design is we pretty much know because they're not supposed to know it's double blind. We pretty much know when someone's taken a bunch of siliciden like it's not hard to tell when that's actually happened, but they're saying that what they're accomplishing in three hours would take on them three years to do back in the old paradigm and their reporting these findings and it's really encouraging. Obviously the Johns Hopkins study was a great study. 94% of people who took the psilocybin said it was one of the top five most meaningful experience of their life. I mean really cool findings that are leading to a potential legalization of psilocybin for clinical use and shouldn't be just for clinical use. This is what's really fucked up. It's all these people that are having all these thoughts and all these positive experiences like that, that this is discounted by our government.

Speaker 4:          01:05:45       Gish. It shows that were being run by a bunch of infants like they should be experiencing it too. You should also do mushrooms as well. Sir, are prerequisite, prerequisite for political. This for sure. It's such a silly little thing. It gloat grows and cow shit. It looks ridiculous. It sounds ridiculous. It appears in fucking Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong and shit, but it might be the thing that humanity really could count on right now. It might be the thing if you could ensure across the board experiences ensured them worldwide over a week's period of time. You changed the world forever and that's real. Yeah. You really would. One, one gigantic world trip where like 30% of the population of the planet does mushrooms. One day you want to talk about a strange world. You would wake up to Monday morning. Fuck yeah. I mean people would be hugging people in the streets.

Speaker 4:          01:06:44       This is a thought I've had recently. What if all of the churches instead of just bickering about their own dogmas and all this stuff, I mean they're all trying to get at the same spirit. What if they were all churches have experience and across the war there was, you know, one basic church that you go to and that church was a little bit of everything. In that church, there was zen meditation in one area, there was float tanks in another area, there was lectures from people like Graham Hancock coming through there. There was yoga in one spot. And then there is different ceremonial areas where you could smoke pot and do, you know, do it dance out in uh, out in a sweat lodge. Or You could take mushrooms, take mushrooms in a clinical, you know, like a really relaxed, you know, encouraging setting. Or You could do an Iowasca ceremony with the local Iowasca Maestro and all of that was available to you.

Speaker 4:          01:07:33       So you look, maybe you didn't go every week or every Sunday, but when you needed to check in, there was your local church and you could just kind of talk to some people, either listen, maybe do some light yoga, or let's say you really needed to move yourself and then go in and pop into an IOWASCA ceremony. Or let's say you were feeling, you know, you got addicted to something accidentally. Oh, well you could pop into the Boga treatment ceremony that last through him Sunday through Tuesday. Real clinics like that. There were run by people really knew what they were doing. I could change the whole world, the whole thing. The whole paradigm shifts at that point, I think. And it's there. It's like a real thing. That's what's crazy. It's not like something from a doctor Seuss book, you know, that rhymes with you no more.

Speaker 4:          01:08:15       You know what I mean? Like, yeah, they took them off on top of the org and traveled to a farm. I do. I am really encouraged by what, um, what maps is doing because they're, they're playing by the rules and you think that you get nowhere playing by the rules, but in some encouraging results, both, both for Mbma for PTSD and he's psilocybin studies, they're getting allowed to do the research to complete these phase one trials and actually test them on human subjects for the first time in a long time. And that's going to lead to bigger trials in the phase two trials and the phase three and eventually there's going to get drug approvals for these. Now why that is significant is that that point, you have a massive amount of data. You have side effects studied, you have clinical use study, and if you can prove that there is an actual benefit to something, you know, it really weakens the argument for criminalization.

Speaker 4:          01:09:10       And then of course there's going to be a lot of off label uses. Doctors who are like, look, this is really helpful. You know, just kind of like what's happened with medical marijuana a little bit. It's been medically legal, but pretty much that is the gateway to legalization. But they're following the steps along the path that could potentially allow this to be legal. There's that path and then there's the religious freedom path and I think those are really the only two paths that are going to lead to fruitful and effective policy change. Religious freedom is a funny thing. It's just, I always feel like whenever someone gets together in a big giant group and there's a few people running, it shit goes bad. It's just, it seems very rare than anybody can keep it together. You know? It all just turns a little. I've been reading, I've been listening rather to a Dan Carlin's hardcore history about Martin Luther and the the rise of the Anabaptists in Munster, Germany, whenever some new dude comes along and tries to change things and we're going to do it the right way, it's just how God wanted it.

Speaker 4:          01:10:13       It always goes bad. It always goes bad, but somebody gets in trouble and then they start just because they realize they can fuck all the teenage girls and suddenly God tells him that that's what they need to do. When this guy died, he had 16 wives. Exactly. It's always the same and they just chopped him apart with swords and shit and eventually got a hold of them. You know what, the other thing I've been kind of thinking about is too is you know, you assume that like some of these Iowasca Schamens at bogus schamens different people. You would assume that by doing those psychedelic drugs they would've straightened themselves out. They would have straightened their morality out and they'd be all good people. But that's certainly not the case. You know, they, there are a lot of examples of these people who are doing the medicine itself and are still completely morally corrupt individuals.

Speaker 4:          01:10:59       And I was just so weird. Yeah, it is weird. But you know, I think ultimately the power of the mind, you know, if you put your mind to it can supersede, you know, at the potential of the medicine itself. So if you decide to it and just use the feeling, it's almost like taking, you know, mushrooms recreationally to watch a cartoon, you can kind of override the potential spiritual value of it and just focus on laughter and seeing colors explode on a screen in the same way that you can do it with morality where you can take a bunch of Iowasca and then use that, override it still with your mind and just use it to practice whatever kind of power mechanism you want. So you gotta make sure you get, you know, just because they do a bunch of, uh, well Huska or vogue or whatever, it doesn't mean they're good. You got to find the people who are on that, that True Path, the path of light.

Speaker 1:          01:11:52       So you think what happens is probably these people grow up in this horrible area, you know, third world country, really impoverished and they probably find out about Iowasca as a way to make money because there's an eye on WASC at tourists trade aid. Even if they take it, maybe when you just reach a certain amount of fucked up, there's no, no Poland. You back to to civilization. You know, maybe the way the human body is programmed to survive and horrible destitute situations. Yeah, really, really disgusting violent situations. The human body sort of designed to to, to be able to function in those environments and knows how to change and get wacky and crazy and it knows how to deal with war. It adapts, adapts and that becomes the new reality that becomes every day to day living now. And it just seems like when you go just a certain distance down the cut whole, you know, it's like there's no pulling you back.

Speaker 4:          01:12:44       That's true. Or perhaps in, in other cases I think it's happened, you know, a lot of these traditions are taught grandfather to grandson and I think the grandchildren start off, you know, on a pretty good path. But then they get a taste of power. Then they realize everybody in their area, if it's a tribe or if in their community looks up to them and they have absolute power over these people, and you put that amount, that mantle of power on people and you'll see cracks develop. You know, you see it all over the place. People who were once good, getting in power and exposing these inner demons, these inner weaknesses that they have and they choose instead of overcoming those that choose to just go with it.

Speaker 1:          01:13:20       I bet a lot of their downfall is chicks from America with yoga pants come down there. And I'm just trying to get spiritually clean. I'm just trying to open up my shockers and just big juicy ass and yoga pants just, and she's in love with this dude because he makes the magic brew and he knows how to call the dragon dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump. And she's in fucking seethrough yoga pants. Do you know they just fix those. See through yoga pants? What took so long? Think they should give them all out. That's the only fair thing to do. They should have shut the fuck up is what they should have done. You knew what you were doing. You dirty freaks. Who? What? Girl doesn't put those on and get in front of a mirror. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:13:59       Oh my God. You can see everything. I can't wear these. Oh my God. You can see everything. Should I wear these, if you would you think wasn't I wore these.

Speaker 3:          01:14:13       Oh my God. You can see it. Can you see everything? Can you, am I being picky? They, they talk themselves out of it. They know that their boxes just hanging out there and a lot of these dirty freaks would go to yoga class with nothing on just these yoga tights and literally you could read their lips. You literally, there's, I said literally five times after I said, I hate that I said it literally. You did fuck cunt cunt. Fuck yeah. The only thing that this company should do is just hand them out. They should just shut the fuck up. They should just go radio silent selling, keep selling them and go radio silent and they go, are these the these yoga pants still see through? Just go, Huh, Huh, Huh, Huh. Yeah. It looks great in, yeah, those are good for you. Go the dressing rooms over there if you want to get changed or if they get sweaty, you can see through them.

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       Just have a nice bright dressing room so none of those freaks can try foul. Just let them steal it. I'm looking at, look at your box in the mirror. That's wrong with that. That's a little showing off a little block. How's that going to hurt anybody? It'd be good for everybody. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Except schamens thing. They use those American Yoga freaks. They used to a bunch of barefoot fishermen. Women. Yeah, it's true. I mean too much. Too much to bear. It's milky white scan and a big juicy booty and stretching out in the jungle floor. You just get yoga pants. I find on roses, all the ones from Lulu lemon or maybe invest in hyper color. I mean, I bet that's pretty cheap and it just is. And we put out Alpha tights for guys to show their cocks. They'll still be the new, uh, the new alpha thing.

Speaker 3:          01:15:47       Alpha tights. Everybody was like, why do I have to wear, why do I have to wear underwear? I'm just gonna wear tights and dudes who just wear tights everywhere, but they're see through tights. We could just really show your cock and that becomes a new thing. Well look it, I would believe that would be the new thing before it would ever believe that there'd be dudes willing to pull their pants down to their balls and then belt them in place there. And you have your underwear hanging out. And if this would be like a super common practice and then I'd be walking on the street and I'd see five 10 20 young men with their fucking pants pulled down below the crack of their ass. And I'm like, what are you doing? Do you know stupid? This is so, I wouldn't believe that that will be possible.

Speaker 3:          01:16:26       And it is. So I believe that the, the, the cock tights, we'd be the shit was it from you that we were talking about that that was part of prison culture. And they don't have belts. You can't have belts cause you can choke someone. Definitely you could kill yourself. And so they would sag their pants. Easy access for their, for their daddies to just bend them over. Well, the, the, the booty master was that guy's name, the one got the booty bandit who was in that aisle locked up show. You ever seen that show? No. You've never seen that Brian. Please pull that up. Since we have this amazing Internet connection now the booty booty bandit from locked up or they also call and the most terrifying man on earth or something like that. But he was all talking about dudes that are sagging, you know, and then he

Speaker 4:          01:17:09       goes, to me, that's sexy. He's like that sexy like you, you sang in front of me. Yeah. You find that this is a huh? This guys to fucking terrified it. Kentucky state penitentiary. We met police jobs. The booty warrior a long time. That's what it costs him. Sorry. Different kinds of homosexuality, right? Yeah, he does sexual dissolves, right. Sean [inaudible] and a warm place all along, get home or [inaudible] all they home made a map warming [inaudible] and it say the most memorable story that's police told us to look. That guy looks like the type of guy that he would lock get his cell. Why don't they just fucked to death? Why don't they just sit in like returns like flashlights are returns, you know, it was a good one. Just send out a person. I did talk to the system and Moody. They weren't, they weren't down with it. Um, more important. Boody was more important than for a man, but, oh no, no. He had the first half. Correct. And the second half wrong. It looked low. Booming. I ave to bullying.

Speaker 4:          01:18:32       What's more important? Drank them. Wow. Oh my goodness. That's it. It's enough. I've heard enough to boody warrior. I was listening to a, I was listening to my buddy Donald shorts. He was out actually in Hayward. They're chasing down rhino poachers, which was a pretty crazy experience because they're going after these rhino poachers that are killing these Ryan. I was just cutting off the horn, selling them to China to make Chinese People's Dick's bigger supposedly, which is really all it is. It's all, it's all, that's what they use it for. Yeah. That's the main thing they use it for is they grind it up and put it in Dick Pills in China. And it's really the same thing that's in your fingernails like it has. No, yeah, it has no actual properties that are doing anything. But there's the big horn, big Dick. And I don't know if it's, I apologize about my accent, but he didn't apologize.

Speaker 4:          01:19:21       You would have been fine problems. You didn't own it, but the uh, but whatever in that paradigm there as one of the reasons for these riders going to kill it. So he goes out there, it's crazy. They end up, they end up shooting this footage and then as they're coming up on these poachers, they get shot at. Why, why? This is all on video. If you look up Donald Sholtz Rhino, I don't know what you can find it, but they get shot at by these poachers and then you see him duck down like oh shit. And they're filming this and then his people, his, his people pop up, he's from South Africa, his people pop up with like eight ks and just lay waste to where the poachers and the poachers have high powered rifles. These guys have like assault rifles. Right. But they shot first Adam and it's a shoot to kill policy apparently.

Speaker 4:          01:20:04       But then they roll up on the poachers, one of them is dead, one of them was wounded. It's this crazy kind of scenario. But the poachers are in leagues with the actual police in there. It's all there paying them off. It's all part of the money system. So as they were leaving, they get stopped by the police and they're looking for footage of, you know, kind of what went down and they hid the footage and I think some parachute bags or something like that. And police are giving him hell and they just go, you know, we're going to throw you in jail and you're going to come out different. And what they meant by that was it, there's something called slow puncture where they put you in a cell with another do with HIV, and then he rapes you. And then they let you go after he rapes you enough times. And then you go home and you die of aids at home. And they call it slow puncture for people that they can't actually press charges on. Whoa. But they want to fuck you for life. And so there they were threatening him with that, but they held the bluff berm got the tapes out. And I've been trying to raise awareness to, uh, to save the rhinos.

Speaker 3:          01:21:04       But it's scary. It's scary. Slow puncture in an African prison sign. Don't do it. Don't do it. How fucking terrifying. And if you do, if you're about to get raped, just fight for your goddamn life. That's it. There's no, no point. We're going to war. Yeah, you're going to war to the death. First Day. You probably gonna die. You may die, most likely it's likely, but go out on your shield, son, go out on your shield, son. Don't go to Africa. That's another one. Imagine if Africa was the only place left. Imagine if there was some crazy fucking catastrophe. Most of the world got wiped out except the content Africa and we all hopped over there and boats from all over the world and battled it out for a chunk of the Congo. Carve your stake in Africa. The rest of the world, just to waste just a giant wasteland, a small, well Africa's Hmong population, you know all the people and influences and all the bullshit, all the corruption. That's fucked it up. There's a lot that's fuck through that place and it's so fucked up in so many ways. It's like, how do you bring some Malia back? You know? Very true. How do you bring Liberia back? How do you, how do you snap those back to the standards of, you know, European cities like London?

Speaker 4:          01:22:22       I Dunno. I mean the corruption is so deep seated. There's that problem and then there's the, you know, kind of Middle East fundamentalists.

Speaker 3:          01:22:29       Sure. It's, it's also like you, nobody has any desire to go and use resources to help these poor people out. And these people who live in Liberia or live in Somalia or live in any of their really poor sections of Africa, like they got a really shit roll the dice location wise. They, they, they were born and incredibly impoverished place and it's like there's gotta be something that the rest of the world like gotta like be honest about where these people are. The rest of where I was like, well, you know, they can pull themselves up by their bootstraps just like we did over here in Munich, but now like the infrastructure of spots, it's like so much better to get born in those spots. I mean,

Speaker 4:          01:23:10       they're in the slums, you know, you would see these shanty's, he's little shacks of basically sheet metal and that's it. Sheet metal. And they kind of put it towards the ground just to keep a little sun off of their head and a little bit of shade in the day. But they'd be on hills, right. And there's no septic system, so they'd be on,

Speaker 3:          01:23:26       so the people at the top of the hill

Speaker 4:          01:23:28       just be going in the bathroom in their huts and the sewage would just slide

Speaker 3:          01:23:32       oh the rest of the places

Speaker 4:          01:23:34       down and meet that. And you know, disease was everywhere. You see. And it's a really intense, intense scenario and generally a very good people. But one of the thing and very cool people there that you meet, but one of the problems is, is that there's so the best way to get ahead in Africa right now, the way to get the most money is not start a business, be an entrepreneur, create something. It's to get a grant. So we have some of the, like the brightest, smartest Africans instead of like trying to create businesses. And of course some of them do. But I noticed a lot of really the smartest people I meet, we're coming, trying to write grants and just trying to get money instead of focusing on starting a business, building something from the grass roots. So it's almost like some of the help that we're providing is not really helping longterm. It's just their gaming it, you know, they're figuring out the game and trying to get the money out.

Speaker 3:          01:24:28       Well that is a fascinating aspect of that Bot Africa is that, that's the, the head, the Nigerians cameras. I mean they're so famous. Nigerian scammers, like everybody has heard about Nigerian scams. There's been so many of them and so many of them were the dudes just get so duped. Like it's always like a guy and they pretend that they're a girl. Then the gold out loud. Yeah. I can't get the gold deer. So easy. It is to get gold anywhere. Everybody will buy gold. So if anybody comes to you and says, Hey, I just can't sell it as gold man, they're full of shit. And the other one is they like to do the inheritance one. You even Harris, you have to pay some legal fees, right? Just a few grand in legal fees and the money's coming, bro. Fucking go to the craziest thing you've ever seen.

Speaker 3:          01:25:10       You never run out of money forever. Start buying a house. I mean, you can use it. You don't even need a down payment. Just tell them about this and then you'll just take money in the bank. Nigerian scammers, I guess they just got like Super Desperado a bunch of smart dudes and then just hopped in and started figuring out how scam white people or they're not even Nigerians and somebody else just hopped on the fucking, oh, Nigerian scams are working, let's do it. Right. Like they didn't know shit about Nigeria. They took it to the next level. They pretended to be Nigeria. Right. But they're really like from Sweden or some shit. Like go ahead. I was just going to say, speaking of uh, Sweden or some shit, I was thinking of foreign countries where this guy can go that leaked this, uh, the NSA documents who's a, he's hiding, you know, this whole story. They had more than other wiki leaks. Kinda. Yeah, exactly. The one that showed us that the NSA

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       has been following, uh, every phone call on Verizon. So in collecting metadata about every, every transaction you've had, every, every interaction that you've had,

Speaker 4:          01:26:14       what do you think the ultimate end game is for that? I guess it's, if anybody you know is a problem, they can just go back to the records and fuck you up. Right. Is that the idea? Cause they're not going to be able to pour through that data and just pick on people because someone said, Oh yeah, I'm going to smoke some weed or whatever. I mean I really don't think that's the plan. I think it's just they have it. Yeah. Just in case they need to, I think, yeah, that's the, I knock you down.

Speaker 1:          01:26:35       It's not that they want to invade your privacy, but that if you turn out to be a creep, they want it to be really easy to be able to pull out any data on you. The problem is that it's like, so are welling in and you're giving people this incredible power to peer into People's privacy and you know, what do we lose in return for that? Well we really, really, we lose all privacy because all privacy when you're interacting with, unless you're talking in a, in a closed room. And even then, like if you go into like foreign places, like literally like working on secret shit, like you know embassies and stuff, they won't let you bring iPhones. Do you know why? Because you can't take a battery out of an iPhone. And Amber Lyon taught us that. Like she's gone in like when she was working for CNN, she'd do these like big time interviews and she would have to get an android phone so they could take the battery out cause they want, don't want anybody, otherwise I can have that thing working remotely and they can spy on you. I mean all that technology is available. They could just set your phone off while you're hanging it out in your office, planning your dastardly attack on Gotham city, you know, with your fucking superhero friends or whatever and they can record it all.

Speaker 4:          01:27:41       You know, that would, that would be less scary if every law in the u s was perfectly just right. You know, there was only just laws. You're allowed to experiment with your own consciousness, you know, whatever. All of these other financial system has to get cleaned up first. But imagine that, I mean, all the shit that we're worried about, what are, what are we worried about? We're worried about I smoking weed. I guess someone could fuck you up. Maybe if you would have, if you're being unfaithful to your girlfriend, but it shouldn't be doing that shit anyways. But you know, that's something that it's still, it's nobody's business. But if at least the laws were just, then it wouldn't be such a pain in the ass. But because we have all these unjust laws where we can be thrown in jail for an indefinite period of time, you know? Well, those two kind of scary for everybody.

Speaker 1:          01:28:24       Those two things you brought up to, she'd have absolutely nothing to do with the law in fidelity or marijuana or is it nothing to do with the law should be all about protecting people, protecting people from violence, protecting people from theft, protecting people from injustice and, and ensuring a harmonious community and that, you know, that's really what it should,

Speaker 4:          01:28:46       all the laws where you'd be pumped to see the cops, how sweet the cops are here. Awesome. They're going to keep everything safe. You know, instead of me like I'm on the or stop creeping. Well, you know, I've been really, like I said it,

Speaker 1:          01:28:58       listen to this Dan Carlin podcasts. I've listened to dozens of them over the last couple of weeks and it's, it's amazing how good we have it today just compared to like the 15 hundreds like the way the people were living just 500 plus years ago. It's just, it's total insanity. Total insanity. We would, we have been hell if we're forced to be back there. It was such a short period of time ago. It's like we without a doubt there's a lot of room for improvement in this society and its culture, but we're seeing an awareness right in front of our eyes that I'm not even sure if we've totally understood the impact of it yet because what you're seeing with like this NSA leak thing and wiki leaks, you're seeing this forced response in this grand global way. Like they have to respond to these things in a global way like the whole UK is, they were writing articles about it in newspapers are writing articles about it.

Speaker 1:          01:29:55       Hong Kong. The fact that this guy was on the run, the FBI's looking for them. This is a worldwide publicity disaster for the NSA and it's been created by one person who took a stand and now they're going after that person as if he's some sort of a terrorist. One person that showed that, hey, you guys are kind of violating the constitution. Like what's going on here? Do we have a constitution anymore? Oh No, this NDA thing that you've fucks past that sort of bypass the constitution. So now all this illegal shit or that used to be illegal, you made it legal. So you think you're doing an okay job. Is that what's going on here? This is clearly bad. Governing is clearly, and I think that transparency is being exhibited in like this reaction to this NSA whistleblower thing where people, you know, like the president's can having to defend it now.

Speaker 1:          01:30:46       And one of the things he was saying, I was just talking about this to Dunkin, we were talking about how Obama was like, you know, well this is something we should definitely have a debate about. We can, I'm definitely open to talking about this will really, well why was it a secret then? Yeah. Why did somebody have to leak this? Why didn't you discuss this with people and explain the pros and cons of losing this much secrecy of losing this much privacy. That's ridiculous. That's [inaudible]. There's, there's not that many threats to this world. I don't buy it. I think they're doing a great job and shutting down threats. If you stop and look at how many threats and they've turned into actual terror attacks besides the Boston one and besides a couple of other ones, there's very few, very few there. When you compare them to actual days of the week, you compare them to actual human interactions that take place throughout 50 states and numerous cities all throughout the day, all over the time.

Speaker 1:          01:31:38       There's very few like those shitheads from Boston. There's very few like you know, whether it's a a nine 11 that happened in 2001 or cause they can squash most of them without reading every fucking email you saying they shouldn't be able to read everybody shit. That's ridiculous. You know, I think if you could prove that you were just, and that you were looking out for the best interest of man, maybe you should be able to go and like look into this stuff without a warrant. But because it's been proven like the IRS goes after conservative tea party groups like mark much more than they go after liberal people. They like, they just got busted for doing that. Like chasing down these tea party Fox and making their life hell harassing them, like making their, their, their experience with paying their, they're just taxes. Much more diff

Speaker 4:          01:32:29       gold. Well the beauty is is that the age of information, the Internet is allowing all of these people to band together and make a force on their own. But it's back in the day. Imagine if you had to gather a large group of people, you know, have, you couldn't do it. You have to put out an ad and then you'd have to get that ad approved by whatever newspaper you were going to do. I mean, or find a reputable news outlet that you could go tell your story too. But now with the Internet, these things can spread and these things can gather and people can communicate and that's a force that I don't think the powers that be are fully comprehending and are ready to reckon with

Speaker 1:          01:33:06       Dianne Feinstein was explaining that we needed to do these things because uh, we need to stop terrorism. And she was, when she was saying this, I was imagining that this person gets to speak for me. I was imagining like the ridiculousness of this, this person getting to speak for me, this silly person who, if there was a couple of us and she started talking to me, be like, okay, stop talking. You're talking nonsense. Like you're talking nonsense. If she was just around us right now and she was explaining why that would be important, she would look like a buffoon within a couple of minutes time. She would be stammering. It would be a disaster. It. There's no argument there and there's not a single argument that you could point to where a competent society that cares about its citizens and he cares about the quality of life, which includes respect for your privacy, that that culture would allow these ass fucks to just download every email you send.

Speaker 1:          01:33:59       Dunkin had a great way of describing it today. He said, could you imagine if the government in the 1960 said, hey, everybody that sends a letter through the mail, we're going to take it and xerox it and then we're not going to read it, but we're going to have it and then we're going to send it back to you and we're going to just keep all your letters in a storage facility in Utah. If you like, get the fuck Outta here. You know how to get to read my letters. Why do you need, you're just because when a person calls themselves a cops or the CIA or the FBI, they put themselves into some sort of a group. Now suddenly they believe they have power that a regular person doesn't have because it was only two people on the planet. You and Mister FBI guy and Mr Fbi guys like, I believe you might be plotting terrorism. So I'm going to read your emails, your emails to who you fuck is this you and me? No, you can't read my email. Get outta here. Go Fuck Yourself. You're just a person. But when you're in a group and you're the NSA or the CIA or the FBI or any fucking other three letters, you want to string together, all of a sudden you have the to go and do really rude shit to people, you know, and that, that's the problem with the big groups and

Speaker 4:          01:35:03       rude by throwing them in jail. And it definitely, I mean beyond, right? I mean, it's rude. It's hurting. Your girlfriend reads your phone, text, even if you haven't done anything wrong. You know, it's, it's rude when people dig into people's fast. It's a, I mean I write, I write in journals and things like that and one of like the most sacred things to me is that nobody picks those motherfuckers up because if somebody goes in and reads that journal, that means that every time I'm riding my innermost thoughts, there's going to be a little sensor voice up there saying, oh well what if somebody reads this shit? I better not write this exactly how it is. As soon as that sensor voice comes on, the whole, the whole practice of writing in the journalist, fuck. That's why you shut up and write in a journal after you beat off. That way you're at your most honest really didn't know you're a piece of shit. Spell it out.

Speaker 2:          01:35:57       Got Out of a situation where somebody did that. You know where somebody went in my phone and screen shot it every single text I have every single photo, every singe thing and send it to themselves and that, that now questions me when I talked to anybody. Cause even if it's something legit, I don't even want to type it down anymore because of that. I mean there's like that program that's popular right now. Snapchat where you send a photo and then it expires in three seconds of your balls and stuff. People found out a way to hack that and now so you can go in there and take all those photos and all those videos that are supposed to be gone forever.

Speaker 1:          01:36:27       Very well. All you have to do, there's so silly. All you have to do is have two phones, right? And you took a photo, a photo of the photo and that way you don't even have to get a screenshot of the game. There was so many to week game that we gave this sweet Dinah shots that you just sense it. All these motherfuckers are playing tic TAC toe and there's no girls with workable vaginas that we're going to send good pictures anyway. It's all the game's terrible. It's a terrible game.

Speaker 2:          01:36:53       But that is something that is scary though. If you think about texting is so popular nowadays, you don't realize what you're typing the people, right? Like you're typing secrets that only you and that person supposed to know. Right. You know, and then like six months later the NSA, you lose your phone or you lose your phone, you're like, oh look at this guy. What he's talking about. Oh look at this. Oh you don't think a shit like that?

Speaker 1:          01:37:15       You should make your journal. You should, you should like write it in like a very specific like do you have those, um, you know those a scholastic white and black book covers, it's like that was weird pattern that they had and it was a hard cover TV. Well you should only write in those, right? And write my journal and then make up a dummy one with one of those ink bombs like they have for bags that they give away and during the bank robberies and once you open somebody ship whammy, right? Yeah, yeah. Green with envy and rotten desire, but you fucking green fuck head all. I like dirty

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       green, like a rotten stinking green or not. Don't write ridiculous shit paper and leave it around your house. If I was staying over your house, I'm probably fucking read it. If I want to use your bathroom and I took a leak and it was like, what is this motherfucker writing on the shitter reading? And you're like, why are you still in there man? Oh Dude, I'm constipated. And then you realize that your book is in there and I'm reading your book most likely. Yeah, don't leave your back. Don't leave your journal in the shitter. Yeah, but I ain't going to cut it. I only have books in the shitter if I'm not taking my cal shakes because if I, if I'm on a regular Kale shake program, the job done, I always, the way I describe it is like a tunnel and then those zombies from world war Z or running down down the tunnel, just all stacking on top of each other.

Speaker 3:          01:38:46       That's what the Kale shake is. It just fills up your entire pipe with a thick green, gooey substance. Cause I down about 30 ounces and then those motherfuckers just push everything out and it's a wild ride. That's what, yeah man. You know what dude? I told you we, I'm someone on the message board actually found out how much of that shit is in Kale. Right. As opposed to other things. Salary has more than Kale. The doctor said that while he was here. I don't know, I feel good but the Dave Asprey, how dare you. But he said that on the podcast but it's still has a lot in it. I don't think he said that. I think he said salary had last actually he was whoever the corrected them online. Apparently they corrected them. What he said was incorrect. It's just a mistake whatever he said. But the way to combat that apparently that's effective is calcium and adding calcium to your Kale shake.

Speaker 3:          01:39:40       It's supposed to offset the effects of any of that. Take your nightly TPC. It's got it in there. But what I was going to say is people discount how you know the feedback that you're getting from your body yourself. You know like you feel good when you have a Kale shake, right? Like you can feel it. Like if there was something poisonous in that, I really trust that the body would be like, Yo, you know, don't drink, don't drink this. He feels good eggs, regular pussy. No it doesn't. It's supposed to be really warm. But you know, I mean people, it's the same. I mean you can apply that same if you're really kind of pay attention to those signals coming back, you can learn a lot from that. And that's, you know, with this, you know, the earth grown nutrients thing that Mike dolce is always preaching about.

Speaker 3:          01:40:20       You can tell the difference and then you get these weird kind of ideas. I mean, I like a lot of the aspree principles about high fat, but if you take some of that stuff too literally and start hammering like lots of butter and you just don't feel that great all the time, you know? But if you're following a more kind of common sense and just listening to the feedback from your body, it, I tend to trust that more just kind of feeling what feels good. Yeah. But it's also good to have some real science and knowledge behind it to which act for sure. Asprey, he takes a lot of heat but he knows a lot of shit. It's not a professional,

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       so if he gets something wrong occasionally you got to realize that guy also runs like an it company and people are always like accusing him of trying to hawk his items, which he definitely is like over bulletproofing everything. I asked him if he had a bulletproof wife goes home to his bulletproof marriage and as bulletproof sex, he's just, you know, he's just, he's starting a business. He's got getting ideas, great ideas, but the point is like that guy had free shit up on his website for a long time. There's still a ton of free information. The Greeley in detail, excellent stuff that he's pulled down. He has references, he tells you where he read it, he tells you what it's about. He tells you what the benefits of these certain things are. It's really good stuff. And I know that his, like his, his thing, his truck, he's like, he's on a quest to try to figure out the ultimate combination of foods and exercises and treatments for it to rehabilitate injuries. And he's right about a lot of shit. Like he me gave me a great tip on that. Prolozone therapy for back issues. This fucking tremendous. It's tremendous. It's got a lot of real wacky idea. It's bulletproof coffees. Genius Shit. That's a genius invention.

Speaker 4:          01:42:04       It's another one of those things where you can really feel it.

Speaker 1:          01:42:07       Yeah. Well the, the combining it with fats so that it's a slow release of caffeine. That's, that's what coffee always needed. That's what coffee was missing all this time. Yeah. That fucking jolt that you get when you down like a 20 ounce Starbucks. It's black. You get that weird shaky like, oh fuck this little druggy feeling so much, man.

Speaker 4:          01:42:27       Yeah, but put some butter in there, put some coconut oil, some MCT. It changes the game.

Speaker 1:          01:42:31       Yeah. But just slow that slow release. That's wonderful.

Speaker 4:          01:42:35       You know what else has really changed the game for me? And maybe I'll tell my whole hunting story to hear if we want to get into it. But yeah, I've, uh, you know, I went out on that hunt down in south Texas and you know, we got a lot of meat back from that hunt and every single time I have that meat as compared to some other meat, I mean, the way that I feel it digest the way that I feel it absorbing, it's completely different. Yeah. Castiel is completely different than even if you're buying some kind of grass fed cow steak, this wild game that we went out and procured ourselves. I mean, it's not only delicious. I mean everything we've had has been pretty fucking good. Maybe one dud, but most of the stuff we're making Fajitas, we're making stew or making tacos or make it steaks or making stir fries and all of this making me hungry.

Speaker 4:          01:43:26       It's been amazing. But that was a really cool experience and it may be something that we've, I know we've talked about doing something like that for on it, so, so really how it could potentially work and it's a challenging scenario. So, you know, hopefully we're working, just know that we're working on it. Guys potentially make this possible because I think the health benefits are there and the whole process is really valuable because if you've gone your whole life, and I know you've made this pitch to, but if you've gone your whole and all you do is show up to the grocery store, pick some cellophane wrapped piece of meat that all you identify as as a steak. You know, you really don't get it. You really don't understand even what you're doing. You don't. Yeah. You know, you don't fully get it until you've been there inside the animal, you know, arms up to your arms, covered in blood, actually cutting those pieces of meat out of something you've killed, that changes your reality, you know, then you have a full appreciation for what you're doing.

Speaker 4:          01:44:23       So, so what we did out there in south Texas is there's these ranches, this one was 10,000 acres. And so there is a confined space. It has 10,000 acres, but these animals are procreating. They just kind of loosely measuring the herds because they're mostly wild. The problem with hunting most native game is there's very select seasons in which you're allowed to hunt them. So you have to really kind of stock up. If you're going to hunt Whitetail, you better be in October and you better have books, some shit in advance or go somewhere that's very small seasons. So what these exotic ranches have done, if it's non native game, you're allowed to basically take animals from the herd all throughout the year. So they've gotten species of animals from different parts of the world and they're just, you know, that country's version of the deer. So there's fallow deer, which come from Europe.

Speaker 4:          01:45:11       There's some blackbuck which come, I think they're from Indonesia, tiger food. There's some access deer, which also come from around that area. Blackbuck might be somewhere else, but, and then there's oryx and addicts and all these different kinds of antelope and deer that they get and they're just living there, living it up out in south Texas, the plants down there have roughly 30% protein and even though they're sparse, they have pretty good, adequate protein. And when there is kind of a drought, they do supplement it with a little extra food as well. But they're pretty much just living off the land and thriving and procreating. And so you're going down there and not only is it like a cool safari where you're seeing all these exotic creatures, you're actually able to go out and take your rifle and hop out on some sticks or you know, track 'em down in these kind of outdoor vehicles, which are like these commando style suburbans and go hunting for an animal that you are going to take then and butcher and have meat for.

Speaker 4:          01:46:06       Man, I've been eating the same deer for like three months now. So it's a really fucking cool experience where you're out there in land and these animals are, you know, ostensibly as wild as, as other animals. I mean they're not sensitized to the truck. A few of the species are, they get kind of used to the truck and that would be a little weird to shoot. But these black box, I mean, I was out there hunting for the entirety of the day and I was really didn't think I was going to get one. You know, I was hoping to get one, but I kind of said, you know, all right, if, if today's not the right day to take an animal, so be it. So rock cruising around in every animal that came within about 250 yards was just scattering. And I knew the ballistics on my, I wasn't going to comfortably take a shot that was over about, you know, one 50 to one 80, just because at that point my particular ballistics on the bullet, the bullet was going to drop about four to six inches.

Speaker 4:          01:47:01       And I didn't really have to gauge that to gauge that. But one of those goggles that you look through and it gives you the number. No, I didn't have that. So it was all by, you know, we had a guide there and he'd be like, yeah, that's about one in one 91 90 get her done. So, um, so anyway, so we finally, it's a very end of the day. I didn't think I was going to get anything and uh, we see this blackbuck doe at the very top of hill about 260 yards away and instead of scattering I was like, oh great, she's just gonna run away like everything else does instead of scattering away. It ran like right towards the truck for 80 yards. So it was like at 160, and this is like right when the sun was kind of starting set. Definitely the last chance I had.

Speaker 4:          01:47:43       So I made like a quick makeshift brace, sod in the cross hairs, tried to steady my heartbeat pounding and try to keep the cross hairs from dancing all over the thing, seeing sky seeing ground and then focus in and take a deep breath and then it just kind of turn just the right way and I pulled the trigger, you know, big blast and then it was just full adrenaline from there. I saw it rear up in the air, fell to the ground and I remember running up to it because I knew that if it was in pain they say to kind of wait and see if it gets up. I wasn't really down with that. I wanted to make sure that if it was there that I could, you know, ease. It's suffering as quickly as possible. So I just dropped the gun and went up there.

Speaker 4:          01:48:27       I knew I hit it pretty good and sprinted up. Why'd you jump the gun and just, it was heavy and clumsy. I, well I had a knife on my one night I had a knife in my, on my side. So you're going to do it in lifestyle. You weren't going to use the gun? No. Well cause the gun can spoil meat. Right? If you miss with a gun, you could hit a shoulder which is going to be 10 pounds of meat. You could, you know, miss and clips and back. You could, you know, really the cleanest way to do it to preserve the meat, which is why you're doing it so you can kill less animals. Is with the knife to be honest. Do you were excited about killing it with a knife? There's something telling you right now that's creeping me out. I'm thinking of you going to stray caveman fighting an ear or you saw him.

Speaker 4:          01:49:10       Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you all of the emotions that went through really at that point. So just leave out Horny, right? That didn't, that didn't cross the path. So, you know, I mean, so we ran a ran up there and you know, obviously your heart's pounding and it's a really weird experience. And I go up and I see it and it was still alive, but it was probably bleeding out. It was definitely bleeding out. I caught a piece of the heart, a lot of lung and uh, it was definitely bleeding out, but I wanted to make sure that it didn't suffer. But at the point that I got up there, the feeling wasn't any feeling of like, you know, it was nothing but just pure gratitude and appreciation for this animal. And I put my hand on his neck and pulled the knife out and just, you know, actually a very special knack to me is one that my uncle gave to me before he passed away.

Speaker 4:          01:49:56       And, and I, you know, put my hand on its neck and quiet and myself and then put it into the heart and I could feel the heart reverberating through the blade of the knife into my hand. Whoa. And I pulled it out and just kept my hands on and one hand on his chest and one hand on his neck and could kind of sense the life, leave the body and you know, I said a little prayer kind of avatar style, um, wrote one out beforehand, you know, basically the ideas. Um, you know, as your spirit goes back to the source to nourish new life, may your flesh, you know, nourish our bodies in this life. You know, thank you system. That's very avatar. Like he's very avatar. Like if you set it next to me and I would never let me live it down, I'd be saying thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:50:41       Oh sister, it's true. Why we're eating. It would be laughing, silly bitch and our guide would, would do the same thing. Most of the people that know that they would say the same thing as you. I mean this is for me what I needed and thought you were saying. They would say the same time. Nobody would say what he said. He say me. But for me that's what I needed to say. Like that's the way I'm giving you a hard time. But the reality is that's a beautiful way of approaching it. I mean it's just something easy to make fun of. And I'm a hack right there. I couldn't let it go, but then so are I. Look at its eyes, its face and its face was covered in these spines. And so I thought it hit a cactus and they were like all up in its eyeball and stuff like that.

Speaker 4:          01:51:22       And then the, I smelled the flick, I hear the flick of a lighter and a cigarette and it's our, you know, country guy. He got like a Budweiser and a cigarette. I don't know. He's south Texas guy. He says, oh, porcupines spines, you know, you, you won't see that one time and a thousand. And so basically some porcupine had whacked it in the face and the spines were working their way through its eyeball. So it was like kind of a cool feeling to know that at that point, you know, I had taken an animal out of its misery, so to speak, to, which was not necessarily my idea. You know, I was going to take an animal that presented it, but that happened to be the one that presented itself. But then the really weird thing happened, I got really angry at the porcupine, like my love for the animal, my appreciation for the animal was so strong and I fucking hated that porcupine.

Speaker 4:          01:52:07       Really? Like, I felt like that was an enemy. Like if someone tapped your sister, yeah, no pork, you ban. All it did is poking in the, yeah, you fucking stabbed it. But that's what [inaudible] Detroit on that fucking poor deer. And you're like, Conti Patti Pie. That's what's ironic is that, I mean, I'm the killer. I killed it. The porcupine was just doing its thing. But I hated the porcupine. Like it was something that like slapped a friend of mine. That's so weird. Yeah. Well I guess you had an intense experience with it. So then you know, and then from there we went there and skinned it. You know, you have to avoid the stomach because the stomach smells like old guacamole, smells terrible. It's like, try not to puncture that. I got a little nick in it, but I did pretty good job. And then you clear all the guts out and then, you know, cut all the pieces away.

Speaker 4:          01:52:50       But then we went fully from there, just skinning it and then butchering it entirely. And it was cool to feel, you know, the best part of the meat is the tenderloin, you know, that's what, you know, these flaming, known chateau beyond. That's what all this tenderloin meat is. It's really tender. But not until I was up in, they're actually cutting the tenderloin out and feeling what it felt like. It feels more like organ meat than regular meat. You know? Did I understand like, oh, this is different part of the animal. You know, this part of the animal is up inside, like the cavity stuff. It's not on the exterior part, so it works less. It's just different. It feels different and that's why it tastes so delicious. And then the other parts like the haunches, the back strap, they have a kind of a more sinewy grittier feel. What the backdrop is the up along the spine. That is the Loin? Yeah, no, the backstrap backstrap is right along the spine, right on either side. On the exterior. The tenderloin is actually up inside the animal underneath, like you go inside the rib cage. So it's covered. Actually it's another section of it. No, it's completely different section backstrap backstrap is alongside of the spine and then the tenderloin is up underneath the animal part of the internal muscles that move the legs as well.

Speaker 1:          01:53:59       There's a really cool video of a dude taking apart a pig. I have it on my Twitter. If you want to see it. It's kind of fucked up. Like I, it's on my Twitter from a while ago. So I don't know, uh, what the, uh, what the name of the video is. See if you can find it, Brian, cause I know you're not doing anything else. You want to show that on Ustream. Uh, I think you can dude taking apart the pig. But my point is when you watch it, like you watched like the, like they're oh well that there's bacon. Oh well there's the ham hocks. Oh that is that. There's this, there's the pork loin. There's the, when you, when you're watching it, like be dissected from an actual pig broken down and he does it in like three minutes. They're fast. Yeah. This guy just hacks through this fucking thing. He uses a saw and some spots. This isn't it. This is, this is taken apart. But this has taken a part of cooked pig. This guy's got a raw one that's, that's the one you want. You want the raw pig.

Speaker 1:          01:55:00       I think this is probably, Yup. Well this isn't the one that I, but I had seen, but this is similar where they just start slicing through and it becomes, it goes from an animal to meet and then it makes that weird transition. But when you kill yourself, it never makes that transition. Even when it's me, it's like there's a re you, when you put that steak on the grill and your seasoning it and you're cooking it, like this is a weird connection with that animal. That's the fucking literally, absolutely. Most people don't get that. You know, they don't ever have a chance to get that.

Speaker 4:          01:55:33       Yeah. And it's a, it's definitely something, something completely different. It changes your whole opinion of the meat and you know, probably there's some, there's some placebo effect in there because of your emotional state towards the animal. But there's also, you know, really feels like there's something tangible there too. You know, some, some deeper appreciation that actually manifests and I don't know, I mean your mind is so important in so many bodily functions to think that your mind couldn't affect your digestion or absorption or things like that. I don't think that's unreasonable either. But whatever it is, whether it's tangible or whether it's mental, you know, the connection and the way that you approach and digest, assimilate that meat, which was, you know, energy from another animal. It's just different.

Speaker 3:          01:56:18       Yeah. And even if it's not, I mean it is healthy and if you think it's different, it becomes different. Yup. If you have this even like you can't, it's hard to dismiss the emotional connection that you have to it because that emotional connection is very important. It is emotional connections or something that people poo poo. Oh, you're just emotionally attached to that. Well maybe it's good. You know, maybe it's something that you like, you know, keep that thing, whatever the fuck we're talking about. Emotional connections is not necessarily bad. And if you have an emotional connection like that, it would make the meat feel better. Make you feel better. Like, oh, about your sustenance. Every time we cook this deer, we're pumped. We're excited about it. Oh, this tastes so good. And it really does taste good. But just the feeling of

Speaker 4:          01:57:03       having gone out there and you know, caught it, butchered it, put it in our freezer and then cooked it up. It's like a connection to something that you know our ancestors had been doing for thousands of years.

Speaker 3:          01:57:14       Yeah. Really it is. It's weird. Even when you're doing it in a place with fences. Yeah. No, I mean it's, it's not like going to Africa and taken out a wild zebra, which by the way apparently are delicious. Apparently Zebra stays good. I never had a horse before until I went to Joe beef and Montreal and they served as horse hallmark. God, it's God damn delicious. A lot of coke. A lot of Mars hate you saying that man. The hate. You're saying that and I, I get it. I've seen people in their horses that's like their dog, right? It's pony better. I want to, it's probably like more tender, smaller. I don't know. The Shetland ponies are the top. Top, fast, right? Yeah. Anything with like the crazy pompom feet don't probably crazy ass Budweiser. Horses. Yeah, those are big fucking whores too, man. What did they Chippendale's?

Speaker 3:          01:58:01       What are they called? A clydesdale that was going to be big stallions. Too Bad. Oh, you went with the gay boys. So when you went with the Chinese voice earlier in the gay voice, now you sign of a bitch. You son of a bitch. So the, what we would do if we were going to have a an on it hunting thing is basically just used that ranch and you know, just work it through like they could do it through us, through our website. We explain it, maybe map out your experience, Whitney's experience, and I'm going to go there as soon to my experience. I want to shoot a buffalo. I got a bit and in people like it's not very sporting. I just want to eat a buffalo and I want to shoot. To me, I want it. I have a giant freezer and I'm going to set it up to eat my own meat.

Speaker 3:          01:58:42       I just think it's the smart way to do it. I think it's the healthiest way to do it and I think that wild game like that, whether it's buffalo or deer and especially venison, I think is like the most delicious meat on earth. Elk is absolutely delicious. It's really the smart thing to do. If you can do it, if you can, if you have the time, if you have the finances to go to a place and, and hunt. It's really the smartest way to gather me. And yeah, it just, it's the way we really should all do it. And if we did, we would have a totally different sense of like this connection between man and nature. Absolutely. Yeah. And you could combine it with a lot of other cool stuff we could do, you know, Kettlebell training workouts, s club and the day get people familiarized with that aspect, you know, have some talks and discussions about different things and the nights and make a cool experience out of it.

Speaker 3:          01:59:26       The problem is is that you can't really get that many people with guns together at the same time. And we got a lot of awesome customers. They want to go do that. So it's like, you know, can we, can we do these things at 10 at a time every day? I don't think so. You know Gail, ability of the gun thing is really challenging, but we're going to try and get some face to face. Some, some kind of program is smart to do with the gun thing is to let them do it. Let the branch do it. We don't have, because you don't want to put people with psychos like we're going to have a four of you are going to go hunting together and one guy was just shooting the ground under his feet trying to rocket jump. You know what I mean? You never know what the fuck you're getting into when you meet random strangers. It just a we all, we all love Alpha brain. I love Outbrain, Outbrain, let's play most dangerous game rock, paper, scissors to go who gets killed? Like tag. Yeah, there's a lot of nuts out there as well, I'm trying to say but, but having a place where you know you have like a gathering of the Juggalos type situation for audit fans. Everybody gets together and does battle rubs till they throw up in the garbage.

Speaker 3:          02:00:37       Fucking truth texts, amazingly chest bump and it sounds like a natural progression for on it to start hunting. Well not on start hunting but on it have um, have, uh, an option where we, you know, we connect you with one of those places. That would be, it would be a cool project. Love to have like a Ted Nugent style set up and it's definitely not, it's the same as going out until like the woods of Alaska and going and getting a brown bear. And I would call it is there and you call it conscious meet acquisition. Yes. That's great. It's like you're acquiring your meat in a conscious way and that's really it. It happens to be at the, you know, at the tip of a rifle. But yeah, that's really what you're about to laser that laser tag hunting with animals. Well, it's a funny thing man, to do that with photos. People love try to get the crosshair. Yeah, they do that. They close up on them. It's really dangerous. And Mountain Lions people tried to do that. Um, the um, fuck photo tag. What did laser tag is where you wear like a vast, right? Yeah. Well, yeah. Well you could put

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       like best on an animal, like a cat, just have a laser tag tag cat ranch and you just try to shoot him because they're fast.

Speaker 1:          02:01:47       People don't have any problem with fishing in a place where they stock the fish. Like nobody has a problem with that. You go to a lake and the fish are in the lake, like are they stocked it recently? It's great and catch big trout. But if you go like to a fence in place and hunting an animal, you're a piece of shit.

Speaker 4:          02:02:01       Yeah, yeah. I, you know, I guess the Mammo thing, you know, fish don't seem, they're so different from us. I had a cool experience fishing though recently. I've always gone rod and reel fishing and that's really foreign. You're just kind of waiting around. Then all of a sudden, oh shit. And he grabbed the rod and reel it in and you hope you get something and then someone you know whacks it on the head and you know, maybe you pull the hook out if you're brave and sometimes you're with somebody who does it, whatever that whole program is, it's, it's different. But I went spearfishing recently, which was kind of like a little bit of a different paradigm as well. That one feels a lot different. It's like hunting, but for fish instead of fishing cause you're out free diving with this, the last big wooden, you know, archaic looking thing with these bungee cords hooked to this little metal spear and you're just free diving down, you know, eight, 10 feet and chasing after these fish and trying to spear them.

Speaker 4:          02:02:53       So what it does, is it a spear gun? Yeah. So basically it's an old triggers field gun. The trigger releases the Bungee cord. So you wrap these bungee cords like this, you pull them manually and they go on this little rod right in this, the spear slides in a groove and the bungee cords or behind the Rod. Right. And then when you pull the trigger, it just releases the thing that's holding the bungee cords, like a rubber band gun kind of. And so it releases that and that propels the, the, the spear forward through the groove and the spear is attached to a cord, right? So the bungee cords, it's all full manual energy. You pull the cords back, wrap it around and then release it in the bungees go. But it's really particularly challenging because as soon as the spear hits the water, it starts to dive a little bit.

Speaker 4:          02:03:40       It doesn't always go perfectly straight because of resistance. It's not like air. So, um, you know, good people who are good could probably do it, you know, 12 feet, 15 feet, maybe even, maybe even farther. People who suck, like me initially, like I had to get like right up on these fish to get, I'm like six feet, eight feet. How many did you do miss before you got one time fucking done? I was missing him constantly. And you're swimming around in his hard current. But the cool thing is is some of the fish you can catch with the hook. Like you can get snapper, which is really delicious. But the guide on the boat, and I was down in Mexico during this guide and the boat was telling me that parrot fish tastes like lobster and I should really get pair fish. Well Parrot fish are these little, they have this little tiny mouth.

Speaker 4:          02:04:26       All they do is eat algae and you never catch them with a hook because you can never get a hook and they're little tiny mouth cause you got nothing they want to eat that's on a hook unless you gotta really algae hook or whatever. But it would never happen. So with spear phishing you can actually target these fish and so we got one actually Whitney got, I didn't get it. I fucking kept missing them. She was way more gangster with a spear gun on that. But anyway, so she got one of these therapists and then we brought it back to the boat and I was really curious to eat it. We brought it in, the chef's cooked it right away and he who is fucking delicious best line ever. One of the best fish I ever had. It was like a cross between like a nice flaky white fish and like lobster, like somewhere in the middle.

Speaker 4:          02:05:05       Wow. It had that kind of, that richer kind of crustacean taste and texture. I want to go there and kill one just to eat. It was so good. We had that and I had trigger fish Svi Che, which is another type of fish that you would never catch. So it opens up the possibilities and these Fisher plentiful, it's not like there's endangered, they're endangered species and any sharks I didn't, but that's dangerous when you're spear phishing because the sharks will, you know, know that there's fee. Cause when you hit the fish there's fish guts exploding Jesus. So if there are sharks, it's not an optimal situation. So doing it like off South African coast, bad idea. Some dude just carjack Jack in France on this honeymoon. Tiger Shark. And, uh, I do not know what charcot was, but I do know that he was the third guy in two years to get Jack there. Too many for my cows.

Speaker 2:          02:05:59       You know what they should have? They should have a restaurant. They have these in Japan where it's just like this humongous saltwater pool in the middle where you guys talking about where you fished and you catch your own dinner and it seems like more places would have that. Like you just have pretty much a huge aquarium and you kind of get the fun of catching your own fish and then eating it on top of it. Back when I was thinking of silly Las Vegas restaurant ideas, I thought of an idea where you had that with like lobsters and crabs and all kinds of stuff and that you could tell them a mermaid, someone with a mermaid fin to go down and you'd point to the one you want and the mermaid or to, okay, that's the one you want. She'd dive down and swim and grab it for you.

Speaker 2:          02:06:35       And everybody could sit around the tank and watch the mermaid swimming around there. There's a, there's anybody here that idea once I take it, go ahead. I don't need any credit. I just want to go, just give me a reservation. There's a bar in Sacramento called I think the mermaid bar where it's just this huge long bar. And on the top there's this humongous a aquarium and that they just have hot chicks in a mermaid outfit just swimming back and forth. And it's so eerie to just see like this mermaid shake just swimming and Bobby. But what sucks is everyone's just sits there and takes photos. Like no one's even talking. They're just taking photos of the mermaid. Right. And there's no real point to, it feels gimmicky. Like if they were actually fetching, fetching stuff, watching stuff, working for you, or maybe, you know, they're trying to catch it with a net. Like, do you have fish in there, like you're saying? Yeah. They also have this a restaurant. I've been researching a lot of things in Japan lately, but they have this restaurant called the no panties, a restaurant where they have, they have this, no, you were going to say that they have this, uh, this, this thing, uh, what's, uh, like a conveyor belt going around the top of

Speaker 3:          02:07:35       the restaurant and they just have huge dishes. And so you just go there to your waitress and you're like, I would like that roast beef. And then she sits, stands up on this like thing that get it. Why did you choose those beef? And she's got no panic and she's got no panties on and it's a party support restaurants like this in America. I mean if you really like to grow, you would be constantly getting more dishes, more food. What do you think that Americans is to savage and that people would just start grabbing her and they wouldn't be able to just let her do that I guess. I mean if there's not many restaurants like that in America anyway that are crazy, like there's that restaurant Dick's where everyone's, they just like, or an asshole to you the whole time. I would not email.

Speaker 3:          02:08:12       I can think that most partners, most spouses and you know in America just would not allow. It would not go there and we're not allowed to husbands or boyfriends or anybody. You could go there, period. Ever. It's not exactly felt like no dogs. Restaurants like have a Hooters where they're just just no top. Well they do. I mean that place in Florida that we went to a strip club, right. They serve wings and there's no tops. Yeah. It's already been done. Rachel's best food ever. Yeah. There's a, there's nothing wrong with looking at a little box where you're having some roast beef on that little vagina and just like, there's nothing wrong for the gals to to go to Cox and get some chicken while dudes are swinging dicks in front of him. Hot Dogs. They really wanted, what's wrong with it? Nothing. It's nothing wrong with it.

Speaker 3:          02:08:57       Whatever they want. Let them do what they want. Right. Isn't that, wouldn't that be better? And let us all decide what we actually like set of confusion the shit out of Catholic school girls by telling him the caucus bad. Who's the biggest freaks ever? Right. Catholic school there were oppressed. Did you ever have a Catholic school girl experience? Yeah. One of my first girlfriends in Catholic high school, all girls high school and every one, every girl in that class was rabid, rabid. They got ahold of some cock. As soon as they got out of school, they would just start jerking dudes off. They couldn't help themselves. They were in a trance. Anytime we repressed those naturally, it's not going to get everything all. That's fascinating, isn't it? That girl was easily one of the, like most sexually explosive girls I had ever dated ever. Like it was like as soon as you would start making out, she would go full, like say tannic possession. It was insane. It was rich with so many other emotions of sin and danger and all of these things wrapped up with an already exciting sexual experience. Yeah, it's just too much. Yeah, and we were both 17 fuck you're doing when you're 17 you're just, you're, you're like just a meat machine. Just moving to the whim of hormones. Dick Pills. That's what happens to me. It's not though. It's not the same. It's not the same. You're forcing it and you're like, oh good papa glug, glug, glug, glug.

Speaker 3:          02:10:21       There's a big difference between that and when you do remember those 17 year old boners, those things were ridiculous. They would hurt your dick would get so hard. It would hurt my dick felt like I was going to blow up this morning cause yeah, but you're on pills. Some wacky fucking shit that you got it. Account store. I had to do the thing where I had to take a shit when I woke up this morning. So I had to like have a bucket that I usually use to calm your dog and so I could pee in a bucket. What? Cause I couldn't Tuck my dick down while I was shitting. Well you got to learn how to have better balance. You gotta look at it like doing a downward dog. I just grab a hold of the top of the lid of the, you know the top where the upper deck is, right.

Speaker 3:          02:10:56       And then just bend down. Push your dick down. Yeah, but don't push your ball. Don't push your ball style so far back that it gets in the way. Your Shit. Yeah. Cause that's going to slide right down. You're going to have to do one at a time. That's where you going. I couldn't have to rock bottom before. I mean when you guys, Shit, you can't really stop that p. That's like a p that you can't stop whining. You're shitting because it will stop the shit also. You know what I mean? And then if he tried to stop it that deeply, but now I'm forced to. I don't think I've ever actually shit with above. I just wait. Brian is constantly on site all day, every day. Can't get rid of boners. It's affecting the way shit. He's like holding it in because he knows his boner lasts for six hours and other three hours I'll be able to shit. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:11:43       So one of, one of the stories I've been reading after reading Danieli Billy's book, I went back and reread some of my, uh, biographies of Rasputin. Oh yeah. You want to as Dick. Yeah. Freak pastured has, apparently he had a foot long Dick with award. At the root of it. They killed the guy. Well, apparently there's pull it up, Brian. This is Prince Putin's cock. Prince Paul was, uh, apparently tried to make homosexual advances at respite and it wasn't feeling it. Rasputin was the old hard drinking Siberia and peasant wizard and he liked women. And that was part of the adaptations he made to his religion is that he was, he always struggled with the fact that, you know, you couldn't have sex and Christianity, but he wanted to be, you know, man of deep faith. Brian's right there under Google images. Rasputin's cocked. They really do have it. Holy Shit. So, so yeah, you put it up. He would, he would go in.

Speaker 3:          02:12:41       I struggle with it. You're allowed to have that on Ustream. I talked to Brad today. It looks like a potato. And look at that. That is Rasputin's deck. But apparently he could, he could base. So he made an exception in yeah. And his

Speaker 4:          02:12:56       religion. He, uh, he saw some birds singing in the print. This is his story. The birds were singing and they were moved by sexual desire to sing such a beautiful song. And if the God made the birds sing to create such a song and bring that out of them, then man's sexual desire must be for the same thing. And then he had this revelation in the forest, probably eating m Anita miscarry mushrooms and then apparently came across three women, three women bathing, and he made love to each of them in turn and then prayed more clearly than he'd prayed in months. And it was solidified. Yeah. Really, because your mind is totally, Chris Dodd was a giant Dick. Fuck yeah. After that point he was like, okay, so God didn't strike me down and I'm praying better than ever. So he adapted that to is a kind of philosophy, but apparently he had, it was kind of a, a bit of a hypnotist, wizard, whatever.

Speaker 4:          02:13:42       I don't know how far you want to go with his powers, but the reports were that he could contract and dilate his pupils that will like through mental control so he could do like weird shit. And he had a huge Dick and we just made just cut a swath through all of Russia. Everybody was able to dilate his pupils at will. It probably means he was on drugs. Probably. Yeah, most likely giant Dick Dude on drugs. And that's where they didn't cut it off at that and it looks like they went in and kind of dug some of the dick out, what they had to do to kill him. So apparently this guy used to pull for the bulb item, a lot of Poland, a lot of people didn't like him. They hated him for it. He was probably fucked everybody. There was accusations that he was fucking this Arrieta and cause he was healing Tsar Nicholas The sun.

Speaker 4:          02:14:28       So all these kind of, you know, people were jealous at one point, one point he was having so much sex. He loved drinking and dancing and fucking, and he was in this bar and he's all haggard and they're like, you're not Rasputin. And he's like, like hell, I'm not. And he pulled his pants down and waved to dick around and it was like, oh, your ass beat and okay, whatever. Damn. But anyways, this one guy wanted to prince USIP of apparently wanting to have sex with, rescued, rescued and wasn't down with it. And the tide of the tide kind of turned against them and popular culture and he told his family that he was probably going to die. So they go there and they start feeding him cyanide cakes, right. And apparently fed him enough cyanide cakes to kill many, many people. But that didn't work.

Speaker 4:          02:15:05       Rasputin got a little bit sick and then he kept eating the cakes and he was like, play me some gypsy music. Used to pop and started dancing. They're like, oh fuck, this isn't working. So then they, then they took out a gun, shot him in his back, Bam, Bam. Shot him right in the torso and his back and he apparently just roared like a bear and stared at him. So they all freaked out and started kicking him and stomping him and kicked his head and kicked him so hard that his eyeball fell out and just totally beat him to a bloody pulp and then wrapped them in a carpet, wrapped them in change and threw him in a frozen river. And then when they found the body washed up, he didn't die of any of that shit. He died of drowning because they had the water that they saw in his lungs from him gasping for air.

Speaker 4:          02:15:48       So whatever the fuck was, this guy was doing you as a strong motherfucker like no, they were not really unhappy with him. Dude. His Dick was 11 inches. That's big. And it's thick as most men's risks. That's what it says. The Russian women were all about it. That is incredible. The dude was just super gangster. What do you mean it doesn't look that big? It's bigger than that chick's whole entire head. It's soft, dude. Oh, you son of a bitch. I don't think you're allowed to do that. Brad from Ustream will frown upon those kinds of Shenanigans. We don't want to get them in trouble. Brian. I think I found the big foot. Look in the jar. Shut the fuck off to stop.

Speaker 3:          02:16:34       I've been talking to too many big foot people, man. This, this, this show has been very fascinating. I'm learning a lot. I can't wait to talk about it, but I can't talk about it yet because I'm learning a lot weren't crazy people. Sun Sasquatch is to, Oh, I'm wearing a lot about everything. It's all connected. It's all, it's all connected cycles. Psychic, Sasquatch, the whole thing. Ufos. No, no shape my balls. Um, trim, Trim. The upper stack.

Speaker 2:          02:17:05       Do you put shaving cream on or you just lightly glide the,

Speaker 3:          02:17:09       I'm glad you asked Brian. I like to use a double blade, razor and defense soap. I lather up the old sacker Rooney, get it nice and primed with soap. And then just the razors of today, you don't need to go five bucks. I don't know how many blades are on there cause I can't count. So I just get in there, whatever it says. Never son. These razors are so good these days. You're not going to nick it unless you're not paying attention. What about asshole? I let that go. He's like, oh I let welcome to the jungle. We got fun and Games. I don't know what's going on back there. I leave it alone. I wash it whenever possible and ignore it. I guess like a squirrel with a bullet wasn't very happy with the balls forward. Everything back outsider, I dunno. I Dunno where it fits in the equation and I want them to do their rake went over it. My Shit usually looks like like it's like a lot of, there's a lot of green in there like chunks of leafy vegetables until I gorge on meat and then it becomes a hard chunky. Brian, do you think that hairy vaginas are can making a comeback? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:18:12       they are, but I mean there's two different kinds. There's the ones that they've always had the hairy vagina and then there's the girls that recently like I'm taking care of this and bring it back because I, there was one recently where it was just like, no, this has not, this is like seventies vagina. That hasn't been touched since the 70s and I think that that's a little too much. Yeah, that's too much. That's discussing. I don't, I, I, you know what, I like it completely shaved.

Speaker 3:          02:18:35       Yeah. Nothing wrong with that either. It's interesting though, what a total victory porn has had over the way women take care of their vaginas. Complete. Damon took Dave internalized the whole philosophy. Yeah. Well they had to keep up. They had to compete. Too many guys were like looking at these perfectly shaved vaginas and with girls licking them and you know, beaten off to him and then the women catch them and I'm like, Oh, this mother fucker likes this shit. I got to shave it all down.

Speaker 2:          02:19:01       And like the little Hitler ones that the girls do that almost like, hey, you're putting an eyelash or an eyebrow on your pussy. That's creepier to me. Then having, here's the

Speaker 3:          02:19:09       man, I never had a problem with the big Bush. You know, when, when girls started trimming it all down, I was like, yeah, I guess that's better. But do you remember like when you were in high school and girls never shaved it? It was always craziness down there. It was chaos down there. Do. You didn't get upset. You know, you didn't get bummed out. You remember like we tell stories like dude, all the way up to her assholes, just can't remember where I fucking a year over a back, and this is a girl that I dated who had hair. She had hair everywhere. I mean it was crazy. She had like her lower back was Harry, you know, she was hot as fuck though, Dude. It didn't matter. She was just cannot deal with that. Oh, you could have, trust me. You could've dealt with it.

Speaker 3:          02:19:45       I'm definitely down with the whole Harry, the whole thing down there. But then the armpits still in the last, I can't, I can't deal with that. Yeah, I'm not even good with that. When I see a little light fuzz on their cheek, you know when the sunlight hits it, right. Creeps. But the armpits and like even the hairy legs, not so much, but the armpits still fucked me up. I was friends with a gal who went to an all girls college in um, in Boston. I forget which one, but it's super, she was super left wing, like the most left wing person ever dated like vegetarian, like full on her friends and shaved their legs at all. She didn't shave her legs either, but she was blonde so you couldn't tell. But her friend looked like a hobbit. It was the strangest thing ever. I W W whenever house, her friend was Greek and she had hobbit legs, her legs would just black with hair and black feet and I'm complete and total hypocrite to say there's something wrong with that.

Speaker 3:          02:20:39       Complete total hypocrites doesn't really fit at all. Well, how could I, how dare I say anything? It's true. There's wrong with that. If that's her choice, but damn it was gross. Didn't matter. I have no business thinking it's gross. I'm fucking grocer for sure. But it was gross. I had to get out of there. It was freaking me out. It's fucking hairy feet. It was just so weird. They were so weird. They were like, they were, they were both. They both came from money, money and educated parents and they were like just fucking fighting the power tooth and claw and I guess I really appreciate that. And then a lot of ways like, you know, if you have like really oppressive parents are very strict parents and once you very rigid in their focus, you want to break away from that and like make it warm. Completely radical. Opposing opinions make a statement. But when the armpit hair starts creeping, like I'm in a new beach that's creeping over onto the tit, you know, if you ever did he go here and it says on the nipples. Yeah. Big hitters that they didn't do a daily down the Nipples, right? Yup. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          02:21:45       back to weird places there now Joe, Esther head one really long and it got caught in my, between my two front teeth and it plucked and she screamed, Jesus son, that's not true. Wow. He just got called outside. You just got called the fuck out now. And you need to tell the truth though. Is it true or is it not true? Yeah, it's true. Totally true. Brian. Sorry. Apologize. No perfect person right there. All right, let's get the fuck out of here. It's late. It's 10 30. I've been working all day talking to crazy people and I can talk to a senator to him about Ufo Ufos. Can wait to tell you, but you got an a half to a, if anybody hasn't seen any of my latest videos, I just did one on the psychedelic experience. Pretty cool. Please try and check it out. Doing like these, uh, Jason [inaudible] pills and they're fucking good man.

Speaker 3:          02:22:36       What was that? The one on the psychedelic experience just called the psychedelic experience. vimeo.com/warrior poet us now can check them out. It's fun. That's a very good one. It's very fun. I enjoy it very much. I liked that you do in that two man. And it's really easy to criticize those things. It's really easy to mock them and make fun of. And uh, if you were in front of me when you did it, I probably would have mocked you a little bit. But it's not that it's not good. It's trying to put some, put some info out there. You know the right vibes out there and that's the problem with the right vibes as they'd been co opted by silly douche bag. So if you get in that mix, that energy vibe, love mix, you can, you know immediately like what bitch, what are you doing?

Speaker 3:          02:23:14       What are you trying to do over there? And you started to call you a and you fuckhead you know it's like no, you're trying to do the right thing, but there's so many people that aren't, that are mixed up in the same vein. I, that's why, I mean I hear going to burning man's a lot of fun. Good fucking luck with that. Good luck with that because this is at least 10 dudes there that you do not ever want to be stuck talking to and they're there in a tent right next to you. Just at least 10 dudes, 10 dude that a 20 I would say maybe let's be super generous. If Bernie man has 50,000 people, I don't know how many people would ask if it has 50,000 people and 10 of them are just insufferable twats why would you go right? Maybe because 10 of them are unimpossible inspirations, but the people that go to Brian, man, I know so many cool people that go, there's a lot of fuck crampy.

Speaker 3:          02:24:00       Hancock goes and so you'd go for though. You figure those guys balance out the comments. If you could stay with them, stick close to the herd, don't stress.
