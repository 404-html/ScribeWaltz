Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Five, four, three, two, one Yamaha. And realize my good friend Doug Dorin. Hello Douglas. Hello Joe Rogan, who to see or so away, man, dude. And uh, Brian Richards, your friend, a wildlife biologist and um, well we're going to talk about a bunch of things, but one of the things that I wanted to talk about is this scary disease that uh, well when Ted nugent was on the podcast, uh, he downplayed the consequences and effects of something called cwd or chronic wasting disease, which has made it onto your farm and you live in Wisconsin and you have this beautiful place that we visited when we did the immediate or television show. And this is a new thing that this chronic wasting disease was just, just, it decimates the deer's health and kills them. And the suspicion is that some of us at least comes from these high fence operations where people grow dear, um, and treat them like, instead of like a wild animal, they treat them like a domesticated animal and have them all feeding off of the same pile of food and they share this disease. Is this all correct and accurate? Brian

Speaker 2:          00:01:16       boy, you just started out about an hour's worth of congress. Um, so yeah, just a little bit. I'm a, I'm a wildlife biologist with the national wildlife health center, US geological survey up in Madison, Wisconsin. And so, uh, one of the things that I spend a lot of time on is chronic wasting disease. I wouldn't say that makes me necessarily an expert, but I've gotten to know a lot of people that I would call experts over the years. So I've gained a little bit of knowledge. So I don't, I mean your, your statement there, we could start a number of different places

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       this disease. Um, essentially, well, describe what it does do these animals and why it's such a major concern. It hasn't jumped to humans yet that we're aware that we're aware of, but it is a possibility, a very real possibility.

Speaker 2:          00:02:03       We can't rule it out at this point in time. Science is unable to rule it out. So, okay, that's a great place to start. Why would we care about this thing called chronic wasting disease? And I would argue in, in some other scientists have argued there's two major reasons. Number one is the impacts of this disease on members of the deer family themselves. And the other is that we cannot rule out the possibility that cwd could become a human health issue at some point down the road. Guys, you kind of nailed those two with regard to deer or members of the deer family, whitetail deer, mule deer, elk, Moose, and most recently it was picked up in, in reindeer, in Norway of all places. Um, we, we could articulate some reasons, some rationale why this disease might be thought of as being important. First we look at is would be geographic spread.

Speaker 2:          00:02:56       So, you know, cwd 20 years ago was thought to be this really novel thing in a very restricted geographic range in south eastern Wyoming, adjacent North Eastern Colorado, and maybe a little spill over and in Nebraska, a wildlife biologist, wildlife disease specialist looked at this disease. It was interesting. Uh, we didn't know much about it at that point in time, but it seemed to be very isolated there. What does it do to the dear Kilz dare, right. But how does it kill him? Alright, so this is a member of a family of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. These are tss. So big long words. Transmissible means it can go from animal aid. Animal be spongiform means looks like a sponge and encephalopathy means disease of the brain. So you put it together. And so this disease results in holes in the brain resulting in progressive neurological degeneration followed by death. Okay. It's a, it's a death sentence and there's no,

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       or for it, it's not like you can capture the deer and give them some sort of metal

Speaker 2:          00:04:02       cation. No cure for these diseases. The sweeter diseases. You know, there's a, there's a members of the TSC group of diseases in humans. Most familiar is, is one called crites veiled Jacobes disease. So it's very similar to mad cow disease in the same family. Second one, the champions. Well, I'd say [inaudible] you could say price, honestly. I'll just read it. It's an interesting, you know, there's, uh, uh, goes back and forth on whether it's pre honor, prion stand poisoner to receive the Nobel laureate for his work on these diseases, coined the term to prion. And in his first publication describing these diseases, he did a phonetic spelling and it's prion. So other researchers, it's especially, you know, um, some from across the pond, um, say it's gotta be prion. And the main reason that, you know, some of them I've talked to about that is that an ERC stand poizner when he hears it called Prion. Oh, so we'll say Priyanka.

Speaker 1:          00:04:59       Yeah. So I'll say prion from now on this disease, which people know as mad cow disease, um, obviously, uh, is transmissible to humans. And um, that's one of the reasons why people are very scared that this could potentially jump from deer into humans. And correct me if I'm wrong, but it also is making its way into the actual plants that these animals eat.

Speaker 2:          00:05:24       You're correct on both accounts show with BSE, mad cow disease. That was an interesting disease where it resulted from, in essence, turning cows into cannibals. We were, which all cyclists in New Guinea, right with KCC, Coatesville with, with crew, which is a human, uh, disease. A tsc likely started when one individual developed Roitfeld Jacobes disease. That individual died. And as, as a practice was the practice in the, for a tribe in Papa New Guinea, uh, they practice ritualized cannibalism to honor the dead and to help release the spirits from you now deceased family members. So they would feed upon, uh, upon the corpse and port and you know, the bodies of their deceased. So when one individual died of probably some variant of Coatesville Jakob's disease, then the causative agent, the prion protein, which is concentrated in the central nervous system and lymphatic systems of, you know, of disease patients, this was fed back to other members of the family and the extended family.

Speaker 2:          00:06:30       And so when they got sick and died veteran again, so we saw that with brew, um, in, uh, in the 19 abused in 1960 around there, um, it was realized that this cannibalistic behavior was likely the result, you know, or the right view, the cause of disease transmission, cannibalism was outlawed. And at that point in time, you broke completely the d disease transmission cycle. So no more new cases of Kourou, but they had lingering cases with an extended incubation period up to 40 years later before Kourou finally burned out of that population. So now with, with BSC or mad cow disease, we were doing exactly in essence the same thing, not exactly the same thing, but in essence. So in an effort to maximize production and reduce the amount of waste when they butchered cattle, we would take all the awful Oh ffa l you have the high, the bones, the parts that are inedible and we would had rendered them cook them at high temperature and typically, you know, high pressure as well.

Speaker 2:          00:07:39       And it turns into a slurry high protein slurry. You skim the fat off the top of that and then dehydrate the rest of it. And you have, you know, kind of a meat and bone meal, a high protein supplement, realizing that cattle grow faster and produce better when they're, when on a hyper higher protein diet, it seemed reasonable to use waste material from cows to feed back to cows. So at some point, turning, turning, turning thousand, the candles. So at some point in time a cow developed a TSC, a prion disease, whether it came from scrapey, the tsc of sheep or arose on its own is unknown. But that cow died. It was rendered into meat and bone meal and this high protein feed was then fed out to hundreds to thousands. And correct me if I'm wrong, for these crayons, they could survive up to more than a thousand degree temperature.

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       Yeah. Surviving is kind of a, a strange term, Joe in, they're not alive to start with. It's a protein a, they can persist, they cannot be inactivated. So yeah, it to, he's to Cook Pretty Harley. These premiums are not necessarily the living thing like a disease or a virus or a bacteria. Well, they're a disease causing agent, but they are incredibly unique. They're so, they're an edl logic agent, like a virus or bacteria or a parasite could be causing disease. But all these other things have genetic material. They're alive, which allows them to change rapidly to evolve over time. So the, the whole concept that you have a protein, a protein that all mammals produce in a normal form can be converted after production into a disease associated form that has these radically different characteristics. One that you mentioned was, you know, resistance to heat, heat treatment, a normal prion protein.

Speaker 2:          00:09:34       And we have billions of them circulating in our bodies right now. Um, have a specific purposes, cellular purpose, we don't know exactly what it is, but it's likely involved in some sort of intracellular communication. It's a string of around 250 amino acids, so relatively short protein. It does whatever it's does, and then the body recycles, breaks that chain of amino acids down into its component parts and recycles it. It turns out that normal. So we would preamp protein likely has a half life of maybe four to six hours. Okay, so you're producing them relatively constantly. Then there's the disease associated form in all diseases associated prions start as the normal cellular Priya. So they're converted from one, three dimensional form to a different form. Okay. And this different form has these radically different characteristics. One is heat resistance and other is UV light resistance. Um, I mentioned that the normal cellular prion protein has a half life of maybe four to six hours. The disease associated ones can persist in the environment for years and potentially up to decades. Okay. And when you say persistent,

Speaker 3:          00:10:43       the environment, you mean in like on the ground on leaves, on like how would they be,

Speaker 2:          00:10:50       yeah, all of those things. Just through, so if a deer, Moose sheds infectious agent, this prion protein, and so yeah, from the time of deer is infected, it's probably around two years before it develops. Clinical signs of disease goes down, he'll lose as it's fear, a human's dramatic weight loss. Um, all of those things, that incubation period, you know, it's probably shedding infectious agent for the vast majority of that time period. So it looks healthy, but it's able of transmitting disease. We'd call that Ala typhoid Mary Syndrome Syndrome.

Speaker 3:          00:11:27       The two deer that we, uh, that were positive on our farm, two bucks, two and a half year old bucks were we had them tested. As you know, we're, for the last several years we've been getting, uh, initially we got our, uh, only bucks tested and then the last three or four years we've gotten all the deer tested. They were a two and a half year old bucks, perfectly look, perfectly healthy. And these are the first ones that you've tested that tested positive and we tested

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       in excess of 35 deer over the last, well more than happy, more than like 50 during the incubation period. Would they still test positive at some point? They will at some point. So that could be spreading infectious agents without testing positive. Yes. So it's say it's probably between three and six months out when we can test an animal test positive, but it's likely shedding infectious agent at least at lower quantities prior to that point in time. And so then he said it's shedding infectious agent. It's capable of transmitting disease and cave long before it looks clinically ill. That's, that's one of the real challenges with this disease. From a management standpoint, they look perfectly healthy, they act perfectly healthy, but they're starting to have that progressive neurological degeneration that we can only see very near the end of disease. So, correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems like we could potentially be facing a ticking time bomb of many, many, many deer that are wandering around out there right now that look totally normal, that are spreading this stuff all over the place and they're, they're acting normally look perfectly healthy.

Speaker 4:          00:13:05       And then obviously with this multi year incubation period, this kid just cascade and I think we've seen evidence of that now. Um, started at, you know, he talked about being isolated disease. It was picked up in Wisconsin at the end of 2001 as of today, cwd has been, now penn picked up in 25 states in captive and or free ranging populations in whitetail deer, mule deer, elk or Moose, two Canadian provinces, uh, in addition to two is picked up in South Korea. And that was real interesting. It was in captive elk and those elk still had Canadian ear tags in them. So we pretty much know how cwd those Elkton swim across the Pacific pond. Most recently it was picked up two years ago in free ranging reindeer in Norway. And subsequent to that, it was picked up in a small handful, like three or four moose and a red deer in Norway in a single moose in Finland.

Speaker 4:          00:14:07       It's a real concern over in Norway, um, with reindeer. Okay. So reindeer are very gregarious, you know, whitetail, deer, Caribou, Caribou, reindeer. So not unusual to see him in herds of hundreds of animals. So very, very different than what we see with whitetail deer, mule deer, elk, or Moose. We don't see those huge hurts. Met with elk. You can in the wintertime. But anyway, it's thought that this gregarious behavior might really facilitate transmission in reindeer. Right? So when it was picked up in reindeer, nor we said, you know, we maybe should do something. It's an interesting story. And um, you know, Norway has got experience with scrapey in sheep and so they have a long history. What is scrappy? Scrappy is the same as well. It's the same family diseases and sheep. It's actually the first one that was described scrapey we've known about since the early 17 hundreds a disease, a domestic sheep, and it's called scrapey because of the behavior of these animals, once they enter the clinical phase of disease display and they, they seem like they itch bat.

Speaker 4:          00:15:19       And so they'll go up to fence posts and other objects and they will literally rub their hide off of their body. So that's the name scraping. And it's the same progressive neurological disorder followed by death. I think about it. So as this disease creates vacuums in the brain, it's killing off neurons. And so without those neurons firing, you fall into that progressive degeneration. And yet at some point your body can no longer survive. And that's what's really spooky about how this thing kills. So anyway, go back to Norway when they detected cwt. Trying to keep this a little bit closer to you. You're very soft spoken. Oh no worries. I'll talk. I can hear myself. Plenty of the problem. Is that recording? I'm sorry. Okay, no worries. So when they picked up cwd and reindeer in Norway and the researchers over there had witnessed what we are lack of success on this side of the pond over the course of the last 20 years, they took it very, very seriously.

Speaker 4:          00:16:17       Um, so they took kind of some harsh medicine. Uh, they announced their plans that they were going to eliminate a herd unit. They were going to kill every rain deer in an entire herd unit in Norway. The idea is to eliminate the host population. It's called stamping out, and it works in a pen. This is the first time had been done realistically in a free ranging population. Oh, ideas. We don't have effective tools for management as disease. They were very fearful of what would happen if this spread throughout that reindeer population and throughout other reindeer herds. And like Alaska, they have multiple herds. Like last year I hunted Caribou with, with Steve up in the, uh, uh, 40 mile river area, but there were, and so they're very, uh, we'll localize. This is probably not, but at least they have a range that they move through.

Speaker 4:          00:17:07       So, and then in Norway they have two or three different herds, many more than that. So I don't know exactly how many heard you could isolate of the herd. So the idea is before this gets to be any worse before it gets any farther, let's take it out. So they had a hunting season, they allowed a hunter's to take as many as they could, which was a little over a thousand range here. And then they came in with government agents. But it's sharp concern that the hunters could eat something with cwd and then catch it. Well that's always a concern. But what we can talk about human health, let me finish this one up though, with Norway. And it took, literally took the bull by the horns. They decided to do what was very unpopular, what we have not been able to do in North America, they, and so after the hunting season, government agent sharpshooters took an additional 1400 reindeer as they killed every reindeer in this herd unit and they're going to keep it foul, allow no reindeer in there for a minimum of five years. So it says every bit of promise of being the first large scale success with dealing with this disease in a free ranging heard pretty different than what we've been able to accomplish over here five years.

Speaker 3:          00:18:19       Is that, uh, with it being in the soil and dirt from what I was reading, wouldn't everything else is that, um, so at some point there becomes a, the, the [inaudible] um, diminishing population or they die out or whatever the proper word. I mean they're not living so they don't die. But if I become viable anymore,

Speaker 4:          00:18:41       yeah, five years is probably a pretty good, it's a guesstimate. Okay. As well with regard to how long these prions remain viable in the, in the environment and in the substrate. So it's a, it's a good first guess. And what, what they'll do then is slowly allowed reindeer to repopulate. And as they do, they'll be harvested periodically and every one of those will be tested. So, I mean it will be a long term experiment into, you know, successful management and also learned quite a bit about whether how far along the environment was contaminated. So those thing, they caught this disease very early. So after killing off, you know, 2,400 reindeer, I think they had around 20 positives. So very low prevalence, suggesting the disease was very, very new in this system. If you're going to be successful with a disease where animals are shedding infectious agent out into the environment, it persist for years to decades.

Speaker 4:          00:19:35       Do it early. If you're gunna get on it, get detected early, get on it fast, get on at heart. Why the decision to let human beings consumed them? Well at this point in time that we really don't have any evidence that, that humans can get cwd could that potentially though be an incubation period issue? Just like it is with deer may be extended with humans. Cause you were talking about how do you, it was the correct pronunciation. I was pronouncing it wrong. No, no, no. W or Jakub [inaudible] disease. So that has a long incubation period in human beings. Correct? Likely. Yeah. And mad cow. Same thing. Extended incubation period. Kourou could, you know, some of the cases, it looks like we're up maybe even to 40, maybe even 50 year incubation. Prts individually,

Speaker 3:          00:20:22       I'm talking about crew for me because every time I talked to this guy, I mean I've learned a lot from him about all kinds of things and diseases. But, uh, yesterday we were talking about Kourou and I'm, one of the things that was interesting to me about it is that these tribes, the women and children contracted it. Yeah, that's true. Isn't that interesting? And the reason why was the man ate the meat and the women

Speaker 4:          00:20:47       and children, it, the internal organs, the internal organs as well as concentrated as coolaroo took off. It was one of the features as the researchers in the, you know, in the 50s and in 1950s we're looking at the population. Um, very few adult males had Kourou and it was more focused in the females and the children. And so it came back to that ritualistic, you'll cannibalism and he hit it right on the head. Um, the women and children got to internal organs, including the brain that have the highest concentration of the, of the prion protein, the man, if they consumed anything, consumed the finer cuts of meat, which have a lower concentration but not now. So I don't know, that's just one of those social things that just kind of stuck with me. You know, it is kind of, it's pretty, pretty interesting story.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       Well, a bunch of people reached out and some, some were very angry after Ted nugent was on the podcast. And, uh, I don't know how cwd got brought up. I don't, I don't know what the context was. I don't remember. But I remember him saying that winter kills more animals than cwd does. And uh, many people were very angry that this was a gross simplification of what could be a ticking time bomb.

Speaker 4:          00:22:06       I guess I would, yeah, I'd have to agree with that. Um, his other disease out there called epizootic hemorrhagic disease, he ahd and periodically you'll have significant outbreaks of this disease. And in, in northern latitudes where the disease is not been present has often you can see dramatic mortality. 80 90% of our herd can be killed in a single event, but a very distinction between these diseases. You know, Ehd is spread by midges little black, no seams, okay. Sabbagh, he actually transmits, transmits the disease, the virus from Adelaide animal be here from the environment to animal a either one. So while you have these pretty dramatic die offs, as soon as the weather changes after the first frost, the first hard frost kills off the midges and within about two weeks, the disease cycle is broken completely. So it has significant impacts on a localized level periodically. But the disease cycle, there's a definite end to the disease cycle and then it's no longer present. Well then for that period of time and for a period of time anywhere the virus may persist in the environment, but once the transmission cycle is broken, the mortality he snob and isn't there,

Speaker 1:          00:23:30       uh, genetically engineered food plots that they're putting together now or different types of seed that a inhibits midge growth and inhibits the HD? I'm not aware of that, but I wouldn't doubt it. And I think there's also some stuff they're doing that bolsters animal's immune

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       system. They're, they're supplementing some of the, the, the food with a, I don't know what they're using, but it bolsters the animal's immune system. It makes them less susceptible to it. And populations that had been histo just are exposed to Ehd over time. Definitely develop a herd immunity to it. And as the HD transferable to humans, no, we don't, not that we've ever seen. There's no evidence that it is, this is a disease that deer and it, you know, it's, it also can get into livestock. So even if people get bitten by these midges, there's still no concern that we could potentially get adhd. No. So contrast that this disease ehd with a very definite end to the transmission cycle. First Frost kills off the midges with cwd. There's no known ecological factor, which signals the end of the transmission cycle. So that's why we see prevalence or the proportion of animals that are positive in individual locations in individual hurts.

Speaker 4:          00:24:44       It just keeps going up, up, up in captive. Um, facilities, uh, the, the hall farm in Wisconsin where cewd was first detected in 2002, the, the place was depopulated in 2006 prevalence was nearly 80%. So four out of five deer in that cap of servant facility had it. Wow. More recently we had a farm, a deer farm in Iowa where in know disease had gone undetected for some period of time. And when the herd was depopulated again about 80% prevalence, but this was a big hurts. There were over 200 positives in this single high fenced enclosure. And so winners not going to change that. It grows. So no stop. There's no known feature which stops the transmission cycle. And so when you say that something like ehd kills a lot of deer, yes, it does. With the disease transmission cycle stops with cwd. We don't know anything that's not opposite.

Speaker 3:          00:25:45       It's Ehd is more like the flu or you had it on your, your farm esd? Never. No, no. Let me rephrase that. I not that I'm aware of. Um, and, uh, so when I learned about Ehd and you know, comparative, uh, diseases, you chronic wasting diseases, like none other, it, it, uh, uh, as it develops within the herd, as it develops within the animal, it just continues to grow. So it'll start out as a very small problem. Um, there's some maps of how it developed or how it spread in the, in the southwest Wisconsin and we're on the front edge of it now. Um, and it's all correct me if I'm wrong, Brian, but it's like, it's almost like the way it develops within the deer taking that period of time before it becomes a clinical and the deer dies. It's almost as if that's reflective

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       of how it moves from the landscape and moves very slowly. But once it's there, it's there. Now I have read about hunters eating meat from some sort of disease, deer and getting sick and dying. What would that be? Misreporting would have been possibly, I mean, I shouldn't, I shouldn't say that. I mean, I don't know the, there there've been instances where, um, people that hunted deer later died of a prion disease likely developed Crutchfield, the outcomes disease. Okay. And so was it the deer that gave it to them? Well, there's no epidemiological evidence that this occurs at this point in time. And we've hinted about some of the, the human health issues. So there's a few things we can look at in areas where cwd is known to exist. Do we see higher mortality rates from Christ spelled Jacobes disease? The, does he have a prion disease, have humans than we do elsewhere?

Speaker 4:          00:27:44       The answer is no. Okay. So from an epidemiological standpoint, there's no evidence that cwd has crossed over that species barrier into humans. Now we can take a look at a number of, of science experiments that have been conducted and at least in, in some of these studies, in experimental models, we have evidence that the cwd prion protein can cause human normal prions to convert to a disease associated form. Okay. But now these are models. Okay. They're not, it's not quite the same as pumping cwd into the brain of a, of a human patient and seeing what's what developed. Okay. So the science suggests that there is a small nonzero chance that cwd could become a human health issue. There's also some of the more recent science that's been conducted suggest that this barrier, we call it the species barrier and it, and it really is a very robust barrier.

Speaker 4:          00:28:48       One would think that keeps CD wg cwd from crossing into human hosts. That barrier may not be as tough as we think it is and that barrier may be changing over time. Is that because one of the things we've talked about before is that they've discovered different strains of cwd. Yeah, it sure is. Don't choose. So yes ma'am. It gets worse. It's fascinating. It's fascinating stuff. You got to get to that point. It's fascinating. It's definitely fascinating, but it's scaring the shit out of me already. So yeah, the idea is strange. It's really interesting with scraping, I mentioned that disease a sheep, we recognize some 30 different strains and it's still all that same identical strand of amino acids. And it's shaped that tertiary form must be slightly different and it manifests slightly differently and sheep. So, um, now with cwd there's at least two are recognized strains that have been published in peer reviewed literature.

Speaker 4:          00:29:51       There's probably more strains out there. In fact, it's, it's kind of interesting. There was a, there was a paper done a couple years ago which looked at the actual, the architecture of this disease associated prion protein. And there's a, there's a portion of it that's referred to as a loop structure and it's just kind of, you know, if you take a rubber band and or a piece of yarn or something and ball it up into a three dimensional shape, there's a little loop hanging off the side of this disease associated prion protein and in deer and cwd, that loop is very, very rigid. Okay. It's very inflexible, shall we say in humans. It is more of a flexible loop as opposed to the rigid loop. And it's thought that this difference in that architecture is part is partially, you know, controls that species barrier. Okay. So I was telling Doug that paper yesterday, it's pretty cool.

Speaker 4:          00:30:49       It's pretty neat stuff actually. It was right zone. So now it turns out mice, experimental laboratory mice, they're prion protein has the same structure as the human pre Honda's. Okay, so you cannot give cwd to a normal laboratory mouse. They just don't get it. And it's likely this different, some of this difference in their prion structure, this one cannot convert that one to a different form. So some researchers in Alberta, um, identified a strain of cwd which came from wild deer. So it's not something they engineered in the laboratory. They have a strain from wild deer that does give mice cwd fuck. So most of the strains out there, mice can't get, but they discovered one that mice do get. So researchers from a few years ago, and lately I've seen it in the, in the popular media that hey, this difference in this loop structure is going to keep people from getting cwd.

Speaker 4:          00:31:53       Well, the, all the, all the assumptions that people can't get cwd are based that on this idea that cwt is cwd and it will always be exactly the same thing. But our experience with scrapey strongly suggests that even though there's no, um, there's no dna in these things, that they do change over time. They morph over time into slightly different, uh, disease characteristics and etiologic agents. Now, in the hunting community, is there skepticism about this as Ted nugent's ideas? Are these unique or is this a common thought that, or is it a convenient thought for them because they don't want it to be real? It's, it's a challenge, um, of education. Yeah. Mostly

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       just in whatever period of time that we talked here and it's, you know, it's really complicated in it it, and to get to the, you almost want to stick your head in the sand and just forget about it, you know, besides of the sort of things that, you know, your friend that we were talking about before that like I was doing on the farm of, you know, managing deer in a particular way for a particular kind of deer, um, which might be contrary to the, to the spread of the disease. So He's, nobody wants to hear that I can't do what I want it

Speaker 4:          00:33:09       do management. We're talking about management wise and we were talking about my friend John Dudley's, a farm in Iowa is that he only shoots the big mature males and he lets all the other deal grow to a very large size. So he has a really healthy population of big deer on his farm. Now what are you doing in your place? I understand you're just on a mass call.

Speaker 3:          00:33:31       Well, I feel like I'm on the front edge of, well, I don't feel like I am on the front end of the spread of this disease. And there's some in Wisconsin and Wisconsin, southwest Wisconsin. So 15 years ago when, uh, or 16 years ago when cwd was discovered, there were a lot of changes in, in, uh, hunting structure and there was an effort by the Department of natural resources to eradicate the disease, uh, in, in the, the core area south of the Wisconsin River, about 70 miles from us. Um, in 15 years the disease has moved 70 miles north. Um, that effort that the dnr started was, um, became political. Um, and, you know, and, and quite honestly that many years ago, um, I would have likely been a little skeptic. Well, I know I would have been skeptical. You want me to do what? They wanted to kill all the deer in a particular area. You know, that many years ago had they come to my farm and said, we're going to kill all the deer here and all the near the neighboring dear, I would have had some real hard questions. I have no idea how I would react to it. I continued to do like buck management and you know, you were there when we were still doing that. Um, and uh, and there's, we can talk about, you know, how, how bucks contribute to the spread of the disease and, and that sort of thing. Uniquely versus doe. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:35:00       we see different prevalence or curves depending on the demographic faction of deer, adult males, the ones with the big hours. Um, but gears on the law over there tend to have higher prevalence sometimes, maybe two, three, four times as high as other segments of the population. So highest prevalence and adult males followed by adult females and then by juvenile animals. So, um, so it's likely behavioral reasons why we see that in adult males. So adult male deer, uh, during the Rut or

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       breeding season, they greatly expand their home range. They contact multiple, a female or a family, groups of females earlier in the fall, especially with the white tail deer, adult males tend to gather in these bachelor groups. So there's a lot of social contact. I'm grooming, things like that. So because of their behavior, they contact more animals at different times of the year. And this number of contacts, it's believed it's likely responsible for them, uh, becoming infected at a higher rate than other members out in the herd. So now if you are an adult male, then you're in the, in this group, you also have a higher likelihood of being able to transmit disease to other animals because you're out there during breeding season, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       Is there any evidence that w that any of these deer have transferred this to livestock or that it's God into agriculture, the food sources to corn and what have you that could, could be consumed by people even that are veggies.

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       [inaudible] okay, interesting questions. So with regard to transmission into cattle, it's basically the same situation as with humans. No evidence that it has, but in an experimental sense we can push it over that species bear here. Okay. Now, interesting you bring up plants because we have shown a research that we've done at the National Wildlife Health Center has shown that if you grow some plant types in a slurry, I concentrate a prion protein that those odds can be uptaken through the roots and deposited into stems and leaves. Hmm. Okay. And so that's one possible mechanism. A second is that Cypriots himselves a disease associated pre hands tend to form very tight chemical bonds with various surfaces. Like showed him a paper on the way out here yesterday where they bind to just about anything. They bind the plants as well. So that deer that's out there with cwd positives, shedding infectious agent out into the environment, through its urine, through its saliva, through its feces.

Speaker 2:          00:37:43       So if a deer urinates as dear cwd urinates on plants, the prions have a tendency to bind to those plants form a chemical bond. It's not just drying on, it forms a chemical bond to the plants and literally become part of the planet. It's, yeah. Okay. So a deer could eat those plants and that could be one of the possible transmission mechanisms. So that's a second one. The third one has a, we speculated about and some folks who've looked at in, in it has potential impacts for, um, agricultural commodities. So when cdot video was, you know, 20, 30 years ago was really, really rare, you probably couldn't happen. But now it's in 25 states, vast geographic areas we have, I'm just south of where he lives

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       in adult males, nearly 50% prevalence. So when you kill that big buck, take a coin out of your pocket, flip it in the air, and that's odds at that deer. I cwd. And when he says just south, just 15 miles. Okay, so now let's go out west. Yes. Or, yeah. So let's go out to overall in the county at this point, let's go up into the big agricultural areas in Saskatchewan or out west. Okay. So you got a mule deer herd out there. We cwd and let's say maybe 20% overall with that herd is cwd positives. You've been out in some of those big wheat fields and hayfields how many mule deer standing up there before sunset? Shitload. Yeah. Okay. So take that amount times 20% or that amount, whatever prep sent, have cwd figuring out how many times it's a deer defecate or urinate on a daily basis.

Speaker 4:          00:39:30       And that's a bunch. And now think about the possibility that when you harvest those agricultural food stuffs and roll it up into big bales, that you might have fecal material rolled up into those big bales, not just Mike, Right? I mean, most likely, um, we'd need a graduate student that we could have, you know, pick apart large bales of hay to really prove that. Um, but I mean, if someone was, certainly now we're now we're putting those on semi trailers and moving them across borders and are those, could, is there a possibility that these agricultural commodities then deer could come up to them and be infected by contact? I think we don't know

Speaker 3:          00:40:13       wharton to say that, um, Brian's a scientist, these other folks studying that are scientists and they don't, you know, it's evidence and it suggests and they get attacked for that, um, by people who don't want it to be true. Well, and, and you know, that's how science is attacked anyway, right? Because it's hard to speak in absolutes is a real hard thing to do. You know, so it's, you'll hear him say, the evidence suggests the information is this. I just think that's a real important distinction to draw here. When you're, you're having those kinds of discussions, you know, there are, people want absolute proof.

Speaker 4:          00:40:51       Proof is hard in a biological world because there's so many factors out there. We can't control for them all. But there are certain tactics that had been used quite successfully. It goes all the way back to smoking. You now when, uh, um, you know, um, what the tobacco companies were attacking science and the whole idea is to sow the seeds of doubt. There's a, we've seen actually merchants of doubt. We've seen that. We see the same thing going on with cwd. So you mentioned it earlier. Hey, um, you know, cwd it's not so bad. What about winter kill? What about Ehd? So instead of focusing on that saying, don't look here, look at this one. This is worse. Why

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       aren't you doing something about this one? So it's a simple diversion. Another tactic which is, and I mean there's some, there's a body of scientific

Speaker 1:          00:41:42       approach this because these are an unrelated issues like Ehd does kill animals. Winter Til most certainly kills animals, but we're not talking about the same,

Speaker 2:          00:41:49       right? We're trying to divert the conversation, right? Another thing is, it's very easy to do is, you know, it's Cherry picking the literature that's out that's out there. We saw a real great example of this about a year ago where, um, there's a lot of letters to the editor being sent into newspapers in areas where cewd is. And I think it's, it's an, uh, an attempt to change the conversation. So they were very careful to use citations from peer reviewed literature. And one of the ones they used was they found that in researchers in Wisconsin found that cwd was not having a significant effect on mortality rates when they studied the disease. So this is a true statement taken directly from peer reviewed science. What they didn't identify was that when they studied that disease was between 2003 and 2007 10 12. Yeah, 11 years ago. Then the next sentence in the paper was our study can use as a baseline for comparison at a later point in time should disease change over time. So you mentioned that exponential growth curve and how early on back in 2003 to 2007 this area disease prevalence was probably lower than 5%. Now it shot up in that curve and it's probably in that, you know, 25 30, 30 plus percentage range. So you're cherry picking literature to make your arguments that even scientists say this is not having a big effect when they studied it, they're just not saying when they studied it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:28       Mm. So as a non scientist, when I'm looking at here is everyone's always terrified or the next pandemic disease, and this is one of the reasons why I felt was so important to discuss this because you know, people would say they look at it casually good, don't eat animals, don't eat deer. This is, this is not that. This is something that has a potential to reach large scale agriculture. This is, I mean if you, one of the things about your farm, and we talked about this when we're there, it's like these animals are farm animals almost because they're, they're absolutely free range. They're absolutely wild. When you talk about the deer on your place, you don't, you don't have them controlled in any way, but they're feeding off of your corn. Yeah. They're eating all this stuff that people eat their eating. I mean that's what they eat.

Speaker 1:          00:44:12       They, that's one of the reasons why the deer populations are so enormous in farm lands is because it's a massive who super perfect environment. Yeah. And it's also one of the reasons why the so delicious, so well fed and you know, there's so uh, you know, nutritionally balanced diets, but the, the real, what what's horrifies me is this potential for a pandemic disease also comes with an incubation period and that we are looking potentially at like if you just objectively look with no hysteria and no hyperbole, you look at the history of diseases, diseases, mutate and, and many of them come from animals. This is why swine flu and avian flu and all these different things have actually come from either farm animals or wild animals that have somehow or another manager transmit diseases that have morphed to mutated and become dangerous and deadly to human beings. This to me seems like a ticking time bomb. He has a potential one switch one way or the other like you've observed or they've observed rather with mice and this could potentially infect human beings and spread across the entire country. Like wow, fire.

Speaker 2:          00:45:26       Well, we're seeing that spread right now in deere, you know, Salian dear, we're seeing Yale clear geographic spread. We're seeing clear increases in prevalence and in areas where the disease has been present the longest we're seeing population level impacts. There's a locations in Wyoming where we've demonstrated where we've proven that cwd is driving population decline and dear. So that's uh, that encapsulates why we should be concerned about deer. And is this an mule deer? That's a mule deer and in wait, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       And the mule deer have a, an extended range in terms of like their migration. That's one of the things that we've realized, I believe over the last decade, right? Is that mule deer travel far mall far longer and far longer distances on average

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       on it. And we ever saw before I even whitetail scan. So there's an interesting, uh, research tidbit. The state of Minnesota, um, you know, they've got, uh, uh, appears to be a fairly recent cwt outbreak in the southeastern part of the state. So they're researchers are really trying to get ahead of this and figure out what could move this around. So they went in and captured deer in an adjacent area, but radio telemetry collars on these to see, well just how far do they go? Um, this was in a, in an article just about a week ago, pop popular media article, so it's not published yet, but they had a doe, single doe coward that went 80 miles,

Speaker 1:          00:46:48       pretty long distance now, 80 miles circular or 80 miles, 40 miles as the crow flies from [inaudible] Christ. So in that 80 miles could potentially be spreading cwd if it was an infected sure. Throughout crops throughout. I mean, and this is, and then there's that exponential growth. So it's, yes, it's there. Sure. It takes a long time for it to become a large problem. And we're seeing that and we're seeing that in richland county. Um, it crossed the river, the testing has begun, surveillance testing has been going on. It crossed the river and it just keeps moving and it be in, again, all these different plants, all these different berries. People could be eating these berries, eating these plants, fruits, vegetables, all these different things. And they could be potentially consuming these pre

Speaker 4:          00:47:43       well they're being, I think it's very clear that there's exposure. Um, and I talk with Doug quite a bit about the difference between exposure and disease transmission. Okay. Um, so it is certain that lots of humans are exposed to disease associated prion protein from cwd, unlikely from plant materials as well. Whether that will result in transmission of disease across that species barrier is an open question. We absolutely cannot say it will. We absolutely cannot say it will not. It's an open question. And one thing we can though I identify very clearly is that the rate of exposure is increasing exponentially. As disease has a larger geographic footprint and prevalence goes up. More and more hunters are just by simple math being exposed to that positive material. So we're rolling the dice. And when you do biological experiments, I mean, there's a certain likelihood that you'll see outcome a or outcome be. So if you keep rolling the dice enough times, you might see an alternative outcome. We cannot rule that out.

Speaker 3:          00:48:54       So when we talked about this, when you were on with, uh, uh, with, with Rinella and I at the farm immediately podcast number 70 of you, Brian, you put it as the chances are very small at this point that it can, and this is what the CDC and the World Health Organization says, well, the chances are very small, minuscule even, but they're not zero. And, uh, I'm assuming that we continue to, that continues to be the, you know, the concern. And I know you're talking a lot of joe about, about, and I get it because after all humans, um, but I've actually begun to focus more on the effect on the, on the resource, on the, on the, on the deer. I mean, I tested positive animals. Uh, we, we properly disposed of the meat, um, which is a whole nother, you know, line of discussion. Um, I'm still eating venison, but I'm not eating. Are you testing the animals to eat? Every one of them. We test every deer killed on the farm now. Uh, how long when you raise a cow, how long before you kill it? Like, how long do you do grass fed beef? And this is actually kind of interesting. You were talking about the deer whitetail deer on our place, eating corn and beans and gmo corn, gmo beans, Alfalfa, whatever they want to eat. I control it. What my grass fed beef eat. I mean, you're

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       right. You're not taking my couch now the one says hello by the way, telling us way. Um, but it's very controlled. So even though my dear [inaudible] affected your cow well and that they're, they're not organic, my cattle are right. Um, because it is controlled. How ironic. Oh yeah. I mean you have farm animals in captivity that organic purely eating grass as nature intended and you got deer eating Monsanto corn. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, and you know, and, and before anybody out there, it gets the idea that my cattle are confined in a little barnyard or everything. That's a big law, big, large area, big pasture. There are, you know, free ranging within that pasture, pasture raised. Um, so short answer, uh, with grass fed beef, uh, I just sent for him, unfortunately, none of it was ready. I was going to bring you some, uh, uh, they just went in on Monday. Uh

Speaker 2:          00:51:34       Oh would like to see him go through the security checkpoint caring, you know, bags of beef with him. But

Speaker 1:          00:51:42       26 so they were two years old and two years old and two months or three months. Now, what the incubation period that you were discussing earlier, you talking about a two year incubation period with deer before they potentially show any effects. So these animals would fall into that line between birth and slaughter, that that would be inside that incubation window for deer. Um, it could be potentially larger for cow. Is that correct?

Speaker 2:          00:52:07       PSC, I think the incubation period is between three and five years. And so that's why one of the precautionary measures for BSC in the United States is we don't allow those older aged cattle into the human food chain. What does BSC stand for? Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Aka mad cow disease. So, so that's one of the precautionary measures has not aligned cause to get old co for mad cow disease.

Speaker 1:          00:52:33       Well, and from my standpoint, they're prime at 26, 27 months. And so when they are in an incubation period, they're still capable of distributing the disease though. Correct?

Speaker 2:          00:52:46       Well, that's what cwd and with scrapey and sheep as well with BSC and clarify, if cwt went into a cow in a, in a natural world, we don't know exactly what it would look like. We know what it looks like when we injected into the brain of account, but we don't know what it would really look like. But BSE is quite different in that. Um, similarly with, with the human prion diseases, um, uh, an individual with Kourou could not give Kourou to another human being. They had to consume it. So that with a verse, that artificial process involved, same thing with BSC cow. A cow

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       would be s he can't give BSE to another because they're not shedding that infectious agent out into the environment.

Speaker 3:          00:53:32       So when they stopped it, when they stop feeding the cows,

Speaker 4:          00:53:38       that's called transmission cycle. Cwd is a different animal. So uwd and just our deputy Yazzie Times 10 on steroids, while they're contagious, kind of freaking me out a little bit freaky because these animals are shedding. Okay. Uh, that infectious agent cows with BSE or not shedding infectious agent cwd positive deer and scrape the positive sheep are these two diseases are unique in the world of TSC. TSC is a prion. Diseases are unique amongst themselves, but scrapey and cwd are in a different world of their own. So, okay. What, if anything can be done?

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       Well, I tried to break this stuff down to like the most basic level. So a guy like me can understand it. MMM. By time pay for science. That's sort of one of the things slow the, this slow the spread of the disease. There's a lot of work being done. Um, uh, all kinds of studies being done, um, different organizations and, and, and the government. Uh, unfortunately in Wisconsin, not as much as we should be doing where, you know, we're a hotbed of it. I think that in Wisconsin, quite honestly, that we've become an example of how not to handle the disease. And a lot of the other states have begun to, uh, you know, uh, take that idea that if you don't have it, you don't want it. So let's do what we can to stop it from coming here. That's why you're seeing things like, let's not transfer carcasses that, you know, there's bands on being able to transfer, uh, carcasses in Wisconsin and in some cases you can't take it to another county. You can take the finished meat so you have to bone your meeting in the area and then you can take it home. Um, which you know, is a bit of a problem for, you know, for some folks, um, uh, we're beginning to stop the movement of, of captive deer from one farm to the other. But that's just recent and there have been hearings on that lately, so, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:55:47       So people resist that, right? Sure. If your, if your economic vita buy him a vitality depends on selling and moving live deer, you're going to be a post to restrictions on your economic activity. That is one of the primary infection sources. It's one of the infectious sources. Yeah. So they will always correct you when you say something like Doug Skating had mobile, like break it down. So that's a world at 11. So we'd think of, there's appreciate, there's two mechanisms, primary mechanisms if we lump them for how cwd moves. One is dear to deer, to deer, to deer at slow diffusive process. Neo moving out on the landscape that's really hard to deal with. The other one is this anthropogenic or human assisted movement where humans are moving infectious material and that might be how it got from Colorado and Wisconsin in the first place. So highly unlikely that a mule deer, whitetail deer got up, woke up one morning in Colorado and decided to go 900 miles, cross the Mississippi River and settle in, you know, western Dane County.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       And back in the day, my dad and a bunch of his buddies used to go out to Colorado and they, uh, are Wyoming's actually where they went and they hunted, uh, uh, uh, elk and mule deer and it ran the whole damn thing back. I mean, just what you did, right? You put it on the back of the truck and off you went. And then a process, I can remember doing it in the garage in Cazenovia as a kid, you know, working there with knives. This is a great thing. Well what do you do with the bones and the, you know, the, the non meat stuff when you're done? Well, back in the day we used to and it still happens, we take it out and put it in a weed called bone pile. Coyote pile or something like that. Dumped on the back 40 yeah. Well where, where

Speaker 4:          00:57:37       that's still could have infectivity if it was a positive animal. So it's a hospital out to Wisconsin is who knows. But anyway, these are so he's, he's absolutely correct. The 25 states that don't have cwd don't want to get it. They want to do everything they can. So these, what is it? Eastern states or southeastern states and some of the far western states haven't picked it up. Oh yeah. If you go to our website, you'll see a map there that shows the current known distribution of where the disease is. So the other states really don't want it and they don't want it bad. So it makes sense, you know, to look at these anthropogenic factors, human assisted identify the possible mechanisms, how humans could bring cwd to him, to you and stop them either with regulatory frameworks or with education teaching hunters that it's a risk to move carcasses around is likely and much more effective than just putting a rule in place that says you can't.

Speaker 1:          00:58:34       And there are unscrupulous people who purchase dear from these high fence operations and release them in the wild because they want big racks and animals that it like people don't know there are these high fence operations, I shouldn't call them high fence operations cause some of them are wild animals that are contained in a fence. These are farms, there are farms that grow deer and they grow dear with special protein feed. So they have enormous racks. So you have these really perverse specie perverse examples of a deer and people look at that and it like to, to someone who enjoys wild animals, you see those and you're like, it's like a stripper with triple f test. It's like what the fuck did you just do like these? They don't look real. They don't like, they have like 80 points. Yeah. Instead of like an eight point buck, which is, you know, very typical or a 10 point buck. You're like, wow, look at that monster. That's a natural animal that lives in the wild. They have these things that they don't even look like deer. They look

Speaker 4:          00:59:37       like some, some cartoon. Like that stripper with the triple f tits. There are dudes or go, I'm digging that. Yeah. But it's

Speaker 1:          00:59:49       vs to all who are in the know, like you go over a guy's house and he has one of those over his wall. You're like, did you just walk right out to that thing and put a pistol in its head? Like the deer hunter, you know, like what, what is that? That's not even an a wild animal. That's some weird science project.

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       Well, and genetics play a role in will correct me when I start to veer off the science thing here. But um, but uh, genetics play a role in, uh, in, in, in bigger deer. Yes. And, and your, your friend, uh, John Dudley had say the number of, he's doing it. The number one way to get big antlered deer as it's not let them grow. Let them get old. Let them get old and give them plenty of food. Yup. Yeah. But genetics have a role in it. Two, three, three factors in production of antlers. It's genetics, age and nutrition. I really the the key three there, but now know a lot of places will identify these as genetically superior. Well that's kind of a misnomer when you get back to the definition of fitness, genetic fitness, there's only one measure of genetic fitness and that's how well represented you are in the next generation.

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       Okay, so let's take an example where we took one of the cl 80 point whatever and let's release it out into the wild. And during breeding season it comes across a prime, three and a half or four and a half year old. Eight pointer. Yeah. This physical specimen that you've witnessed him, they're unbelievable. So now if you put those up against each other in a mortal battle, I know who I'm putting mine my money on the wild animal. Absolutely. Yeah, for sure. Every time. And it's just so, so these animals, while they're bread, uh, very much like livestock for very specific characteristics, big antlers, these don't necessarily translate into something that would be more fit out in the wall.

Speaker 1:          01:01:48       Well, let's also point out that the reason why you're bringing this up, as these animals actually do fight to the death and it happens all the time. They kill each other in, in combat. That's the reason why they have those antlers in the first pace. They don't have them to protect themselves against wolves like Caribou. Do. They literally have them to fight with, you know, female Caribou have antlers as well, and they have these antlers so that they could try to fend off animals that are trying to eat them. There's a big difference between that and elk and deer. They have them for combat. That's why once the breeding season's over, they shed them. Um, and then they start all over again. Yeah. There's an interesting example.

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       If you look to history, um, it's an animal called the Irish elk. That's things where they're, they're extinct now. Okay. They were, they were twice, three times the size of our normal elk in their antlers were measured in feet instead of inches. Okay. And so during their evolutionary time period when they were on the face of the arts, that was when he, all animals were larger predators were larger. These things got Gargantuan. Okay. Then they disappeared from the landscape and at least, you know, they offered author Stephen Jay Gould. Yeah, there you go. I'm Stephen Jay Gould has offered up that likely what occurred was a change in the habitat that climate changed over time and that forest grew up. If you're in the plains and you have antlers that are seven, eight feet wide, you can walk around. But now when trees start to grow up, how can you survive when the world around you changed? And you'd have to literally walk with your head turned sideways and Irish Schalchlin extinct. So there's a very real example of how, you know, a, a phenotypic characteristic. These mega antlers. Really in the longterm. We're not in the best interest of the species.

Speaker 1:          01:03:33       Jamie, pull up a photograph of these farm deer antlers just right. Just type in google, ridiculous farm deer antlers and you get a sense of what we're talking about for the people that are watching this on youtube because until you see it you don't really, you don't understand how gross it's gotten. Yeah. I think one was called Goliath that I remember. Well there's um, the, there, there good go. Perfect example. That is a perfect example. What in the fuck is that? Because that's not a deer like that. That thing is, that's crazy what they've done to that deer. It's a product of selection.

Speaker 2:          01:04:09       Give breeding there specific characteristics that some people will pay a lot of money for.

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       Yeah. And there's a certain high fence operations that you can go online and they they, you know, this is what like look, go back to that photo you just had with that guy standing there drawing. Oh it's a drawing. Yeah. Duh. You went to so quick. I thought it was real. Look at that thing. I mean that is just insane. Look at the one behind it though. Very normal looking deer. Yeah. Yeah. It's probably a one year old. Yeah. Yeah. These, uh, this is, there's these places that have these animals and some people will take these animals and then they import them to purchase them, import them, and then release them into the air quotes wild. And then they'll hunt them. And then they'll pretend that that's a wild animal they shot. And this is a, this is a source of cw.

Speaker 2:          01:05:01       They are potentially, well, okay. So deer has to have cwt in order to be a risk. Right. So it's been shown, I mean, in the lower 48, we're just, I think we're at a hundred captive deer and elk facilities that have been shown to be cwd positive, uh, say

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       we can definitively identify that the captive service industry has been a part of moving cwd across the landscape. Uh, we know that, you know, cwt positive. Do your, have been moved by the industry even across, you know, international and state lines. Okay. The ones in Korea are a great example. Right. And even we had a recent one where cewd positive farm in Wisconsin that can do trace backs where this animal came from. It turned out it came from Pennsylvania, a game farm in Pennsylvania, and then a doing testing in that source heard they found additional positives there so definitively. So now while that's me, I'll say that very clearly. The cwe or the captive industry is a portion of the equation. They're not the whole equation. No, they're not the whole equation. So where did, where did originate? He said there were the first testing of the positive testing of the stuff was, it was first described in 1967 in a research facility in the state of Colorado.

Speaker 4:          01:06:16       Okay. That's not to say that was the first instance of cwd. It was the first time it was described. Mr. Chan dear farms. Well I think dear farms have been around for a long time. There is, if you Google, you know, tame dear, you'll find some from the you with the late 18 hundreds when photographs became possible of a deer following people around. So we've domesticated animals for a long, long time. But as an industry probably really came into vogue in the, you know, maybe the sixties and seventies and more recently now it's grown, you know, that industry has grown exponentially. I used to work for Texas parks and law, but before I worked for USG GS and, uh, one of the things I did was I administered the deer breeding program for the state. So when I started this, I didn't start the program, but when I came into that, that role there were administered a well deer breeders in the state of Texas.

Speaker 4:          01:07:13       Oh. Like many states need a permit from a state agency to conduct those activities. Okay. And so I was administrating that program. I think there are around 120 a licensed to breeding facilities, whitetail deer breeding facilities in the state. At that point in time, you know, 10 years later when I left parks and wildlife in Texas, they're around six or 700 so it just grew exponentially. And now I believe they're there around a thousand captive deer facilities in the state of Texas, cheeses, Pennsylvania. There's around a thousand of them. Ohio's got several hundred, Wisconsin's got a couple hundred. So, so I'd say they're part of the equation, but I don't want to, you know, I don't want to place all the blame for cwd moving it around because there's other possibilities for how this disease moves around. Uh, doug hit on a one of them. Uh, and that's the, the idea of carcass movement. It hasn't been proven that this occurs, but it, when

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       you look at it from a, from a scientific standpoint, it's very easy to identify. So if, if, you know, I butcher my own deer, so if I kill a deer, it happens to have cwd a butcher my own dear, I've got to do something with this stuff. Okay. Um, you know, the meat component in a deer is probably around 30, 35%, something like that. So I've got a lot of other stuff. Landfills, it turns out, are very loathe to accept this material. You know, it's almost taboo. Know who it might have cwd so we don't want it at our landfill because the effluent might be pumped out onto a farmer's field and they could come back. And you know, they see it as a liability. So I, I've, I've gotten my deer bones and, and awful the rest of the material and I drive to the dump, which is 25 miles away.

Speaker 2:          01:09:03       I said, no, we're not taking that. Well now what am I going to do with this stuff? So I could double bag it, you know, a little bit at a time and put it out in the trash, you know, or maybe on the way home, I'm driving past a state owned or state park or a state natural area or a wildlife management area, and I see a trail go down there and I drive down that trail and there's a pile of deer bones and their heads here. Whoops man. Did I knocked that over? Sorry about that Joe. So it's easy to see how inadvertently

Speaker 3:          01:09:38       just hold your thought when you're not on a microphone. Just, uh, that's, uh, and it is one of the w one of the concerns is how are we, uh, how, what kind of hygiene do we have with the carcasses? So this is something that we're talking about a lot more in Wisconsin now and it, and it's become an issue in one of the, interestingly, I'm the county deer advisory committee for Richland County and we, um, it's a citizen group and we have some say in, um, uh, seasoned structure and then how many antler this permits. There are, there's a lot of things we don't have any say in which is fine. I'd rather leave it to the biologists, but because there are a hunter's involved, I'm happy to be one of them. Um, one of the things that happen in our inner spring hearings is that we had folks come in and say, you know, we're concerned about, uh, chronic wasting disease and we don't want to spread it on the landscape, but when we put the bones out on the curb, they aren't taking it on the, uh, Wisconsin Dnr cewd website. There's a list of haulers who will take it. So there are some that will take it. There are some who don't, but my grandmas were they taking it? Well, they're taking it to clay lined, um, land landfills and how it's being handled. There's, you know, there's some question but it can be isolated. So the effluent isn't being taken out and pumped out the fields. It's something that you, we can do something, right?

Speaker 2:          01:11:03       Absolutely. There's PR, there's clear science. So, yeah. And we noted how prions bind to various surfaces. They bind to clay particles very, very tightly and say one of researchers at Uwm, Madison's name's Joel Patterson. Yeah. Tom was looking at this issue, you know, 10 years ago to try and figure out is can it be safe? We'd done, it turns out if you put about an eight inch clay liner underneath Yale, one portion of your landfill, you can put all the deer and all the prions there that you want to and allow the preop, this will then migrate down, you know, over time through the soil. When they come in contact with a play clay particles, they bind and they don't go anywhere. So it can be completely safely done. So there's, there's a way to dispose of these materials very, very safely. But the, the, the thought of it, the risk associated with it, the liability, some, uh, some landfill owners are just like, Eh, we'd rather not,

Speaker 3:          01:12:02       interestingly, because we were challenged about this, what are we supposed to do? And you can incinerate it, right? Because they'll, well, it ends up being a budget issue in Wisconsin. Everything's a budget issue. And the DNR is having, you know, issues with that. And is something that I'd like to talk about a little bit. But, um, uh, they were, when, when this all first happened, uh, in 17 years ago, they were incinerating urine. It became a, you know, a problem. Um, but there are, uh, landfills that are taking it and they're our haulers who will take it. They have dumpsters that they use specifically for it. They're aligned with, uh, you know, heavy mil plastic that it's, they're very specific to deer bones. Um, but some haulers aren't doing it. So I contacted the head of a solid waste for the state of Wisconsin and asked, well, how is this, I go on your website and I see some take it and some don't.

Speaker 3:          01:12:56       And her response was, we have no legislative authority to require them to take this. So some are doing it voluntarily. And actually one solid waste haulers said to me, um, Geez, we're putting a hell of a lot worse stuff in the, in the landfills then, you know, some deer bones. Um, but it's, you know, it's, it's simple hygiene. So one of the efforts that we're working on in, in southwest Wisconsin right now, um, is to, and it's a funding issue, um, is to put place dumpsters in areas where, um, you know, like I'm volunteering to have one on my farm. It's a question of who's going to pay for it. And if it comes down to it, I'm going to pay for the damn dumpster on or about 500 bucks for a 20 yard dumpster. But, um, so that then, you know, people can come by, throw their, put their bones in that dumpster, and then there'll be properly disposed of because we have a, a hauler near us who's said, we're willing to bring them there.

Speaker 3:          01:13:54       Um, uh, you know, to bring the dumpster there and then dispose of the bones properly. Like they do with, uh, uh, at our, uh, and one of the lockers that one of the butcher shops that, you know, processes deer, they have the setup, which is actually when I saw this when I was like, well wait, why aren't we doing that in, you know, countywide and in various so that people aren't chucking them in the ditch. I mean, otherwise you're holding onto the damn bones until you find out whether the things, if you're, if you're being completely careful about the hygiene, which we, I've been trying to do and I'm telling you, you got a pile of bones in the old milk house down there until you find out whether it's positive or not. And I'm literally keeping it the deer bones separate so that when I find out that deer a was non-positive well, okay, I can put those out or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:14:43       Um, so that's one of the things, there's a difference between what we can, we can, there's natural spreading of the disease and then there's human, like putting them on trucks and move them around or taking the bones around and doing its carcass thing. Is it really a low hanging fruit and the idea that we can't fix this one, I mean that's, that's ridiculous. And it's, it's, it's, it's easy. It seems easy to me. I mean, it's just a matter of will and money and then, and education obviously, um, that we're, we're providing opportunity for this. I've been working with the dnr a little bit on this. We're in some discussions about, um, two things. One is a self service kiosk, so to make getting, uh, getting your deer test that easier where he wants to essentially cut the head off the deer and leave it in a kiosk, um, with some information about where it was.

Speaker 3:          01:15:34       And it's, you know, they're fairly simple. They've been doing this for a couple of years on an experimental basis. Um, but again, it becomes a, uh, a budget issue. So we're hoping that we're going to be able to do is start something called adopt a kiosk, essentially that hunters and people who are at sportsman's groups. So, um, uh, gather those heads and then take them into the testing facility and therefore, you know, keep the budget money targeted at doing the actual testing right next to that, that a self service kiosk really should be a dumpster that um, you can throw your deer bones into whether you know, whether it's positive or not, otherwise you are holding it. The other thing that the dnr suggests that we do is if you killed the deer on your farm, leave the bones on your farm. Makes sense to me that way if it is positive diseases already there and said you're not taking his grand a chance at moving it, that's not an optimal solution to leave that stuff on, on the ground surface.

Speaker 3:          01:16:35       And an optimal solution is dig a hole. But it's pretty hard to take sometimes in December in Wisconsin. Well, if, if I, if the dumpsters thing doesn't end up working out with me, there will be a whole, I mean last year we just kept the bone separate and the, and the ones that we, uh, I actually took the, the, the from the one deer was they went into the, the dumpster at the locker. Um, this all seems to me, sorry to interrupt, but this all seems to be like bandaids on massive gunshot wounds. It is. But go back to what I was saying before. Let's buy time, right? Cause this

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       shit's spreading, man. Yeah. Let's buy time and pay for science. Not Ah, there's nothing we can do about it or the other one that it's always been here, which I think the guitar player talked about. Is there any consideration whatsoever that there could potentially be a cure? Absolutely. Absolutely. See, we hit on a couple of things. I think it's important to talk just very briefly about some paid generic disease management practices. Number one. And I said, beetle, wildlife disease, human disease, livestock, disease prevention, number one, if you don't have it, don't get it. Do everything you can. That's why we get vaccinated. Okay. For various diseases if you do get to see is do everything you can to keep from moving it artificially. So that's why we don't want to move the carcasses around. That's why you know we don't want to move captive deer or not.

Speaker 2:          01:17:58       That's why we went when we had an ebola outbreak in 2015 in Liberia and Ivory Coast, we stopped commercial airline flights. We didn't want people inadvertently moving it up. So prevent, don't move it around. Conduct surveillance around areas where it is to see what's going on in states are doing that very well. Largely. The next one is a tough one. Do something about disease manage disease to try and knock down prevalence incidence and get rid of the disease. So that's challenging. But two other things. Number one is support research because if we don't have a cure today, we won't have one tomorrow either. How is resorts funded right now? Either by states or by the federal government and there's not a ton of money. The last one is being transparent with your stakeholders. Being open and communicative with them. So it's with many diseases. We have good therapeutics, okay, we can treat some diseases cwd and other prion diseases.

Speaker 2:          01:18:59       We have no therapeutics, we have no treatments right now, but people are certainly working towards him. That's so likely it's going to be very challenging to create a therapeutic, something that treats a prion disease because treatment would then mean you would have to get past the blood brain barrier. And once you start this cascading interaction of normal prion to disease associated preamps in the central nervous system, it's going to be really, really challenging to stop that. I mean, it's a, it's a roller coaster gone awry by the time it gets up into the brain. So then you're looking at preventative measures, the idea of vaccines as number one. And number two is looking at animals that through their genetic profile are resistant to disease. And there's some advances on each front. So we can talk about vaccines for a moment. Um, so people, individual scientist's research outfits have been trying to develop vaccines for tss, for prion diseases for a long time.

Speaker 2:          01:19:59       Okay. None have been successful. There's no, there's no human prion disease vaccines. There's nothing for BSC. There's nothing for, but there's research ongoing and there have been some advances. There is a Canadian research group that had a vaccine candidate for cwd. They thought it looked very promising. So I went to a field, a production stage, and I actually tried deploying this vaccine in a captive facility in Wyoming. Can I research facility? It turned out that this vaccine was not ready for prime time. And actually after, after a, I'm giving this vaccine to some elk, giving a placebo facebow to other elk and then leaving him in a conceit obd contaminated facility. Actually the vaccinated animals got cwd faster and at a higher rate than the non vaccinated animals. So it turned out to be almost an anti vaccine. Okay. So it didn't work. So

Speaker 1:          01:20:53       being an earth, there was some sort of active cwd in the vaccine.

Speaker 2:          01:20:57       Is that what it is? No, it just, for whatever reason, it that exceed supposed it predisposed the animals. So it, it was a massive failure. But even from failure, you learn, okay, so they're working now in base, you know, they learned a lot in that experiment. There's another research group centered out of the university in New York who published a paper, I think in 2015 was her most recent work. And they've got a vaccine candidate that provides some degree of protection, quote unquote, protection from disease. Now all but one of the animals that they gave this vaccine to and then challenged with cwt got cwd. Okay, so that's not good news. But the average incubation time was extended. That's something like 300 days. Okay. So they're on the right track. They have a mechanism that is somehow interfering with the conversion from normal host prion protein to the disease associated form. So very valuable. Now will they get there? We don't know so, but think about it. Even if we do create a vaccine that works, that prevents cwd and prevent as opposed to slowing, there's a very big distinction. So if you have a vaccine that makes the average course of disease three years instead of two years or four years instead of two years, they still have cwd are there. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:22:21       Dear farms that have 100% negative cwd deer and them like none of them test positive, right?

Speaker 2:          01:22:30       The vast majority of dairy farms have never had cwd the vast majority. Absolutely.

Speaker 1:          01:22:35       There is a potential that you could isolate these populations of completely cwd free deer, and if there's some sort of a mass die off, you could reintroduce these deer into the wild.

Speaker 2:          01:22:50       Well, okay, so you're, again, you're, you're looking at a giant, you're looking at the difference there between a herd that is cwd free, which means it likely hasn't been exposed to cwd versus animals are cwd resistant through genetics. Right? So today we have, we have not seen any deer that are genetically completely resistant. There are different genotypes of the prion protein gene out there that do impact the length of disease and also seem to have some impact on how often the frequency that these animals get disease. But even the genetically resistant deer do get cwd. Okay. They get admitted, they get it at a lower rate, they likely transmit it, they're likely shedding infectious agent. So instead of that, that kind of garden variety, two year incubation period, it might be closer to a five year incubation period. So now for on the one hand you're gone great.

Speaker 2:          01:23:55       Most deer die before they're five years old anyway, so this would be a good thing. But on the downside, you're talking about a population of animals that have cwd with all these other side effects. They're shedding infectious agent out into the environment, this, that and the other and you know, cause a, a potential risk to human and other, other health impacts on the landscape. So I'm not so certain that this is uh, a success story, just like a, a vaccine that results in a longer course of disease where there are deer can get cwd but they die from something else. A population of, of resistant animals that have as a high prevalence of cwd. I guess I don't see that it's a desirable end point because of the other consequences and potential repercussions must be more desirable for killed him instantly. A shorter incubation period would be preferable.

Speaker 1:          01:24:50       Yeah. Because then you have the, I mean it's almost like engineering deer to survive longer, gives them more potential to spread it

Speaker 2:          01:24:57       absolutely sit down. Um, recently sent out there, there's claims that, and there's research going on in some of the, at farms to dear farms that they've identified genetic markers, ones that are not published in the literature yet that are affording a higher degree of protection from disease. But until it's published in the peer reviewed literature and really tested it, it's, it's a speaking point until that point in time. So we don't know if they'll get there.

Speaker 1:          01:25:26       We've got to put a fence around Wisconsin dog giant one 30 feet high. Well, it's, you know, there's 30 feet. The Northern Illinois, no northeast style. All the places that have it. 25 but so what happened? Half Alaska doesn't, does Alaska have it? Not that we know. No. Hawaii, no. No. Okay. So lower 48, 25 it's more than 50% then more than 50% of the states have it. Wow. 25 out of 48. Yep. So this is something that it just can't be dismissed. This is not, this is not something that's a hoax. This is not. So the reason people were upset,

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       it would, uh, Ted said on the podcast, there's very good reason. Well, look, if I want to, yeah, I play guitar and a fine. Want to learn some kickass Detroit Guitar riffs. I'm going to listen to Ted nugent. If I want to learn about cwd, I'm gonna listen to [inaudible] in Richardson. Guys like him. Well, the thing is, ted does know a lot about hunting and he knows a lot of wildlife. You know, it's a lot about conservation, but it appears that he's, uh, very misinformed or under informed.

Speaker 2:          01:26:30       Let me try and put this in perspective. Okay. So you have a disease which is contagious, so always fatal upon close clinical, always invitation, a hundred percent fatal deer don't survive if humans don't survive prion diseases. When it enters the central nervous system, it's a death sentence. Okay? So it's contagious. It's fatal. Neurodegenerative disorder, it's gotta be a horrible way to die. Okay? So that's a pretty significant set of clinical signs or symptoms in an individual animal. Right? Okay. Now let's look at the geographic spread. Rampid geographic spread. So it has an ever expanding geographic footprint in areas where it's, it's been known the longest. We now have prevalence in a cohort of animals, adult male, so around 50% and in adult females around 30%. Can you name any other disease of humans, fish, domestic livestock, dogs, wildlife, anything else that has that set of characteristics and that degree of penetrants into the population and you go, that's no big deal.

Speaker 3:          01:27:42       Um, I'm not aware of one. There was a one. Now this is obviously very, very significant, which is one of the reasons why I wanted to have you guys off. I wanted to ask Jamie to pull up some photos of, of clinical cwd deer or elk. I think you had something and then you kind of took him down photos of the ones that are sick. That, so again, 24 month plus or minus a incubation period in the last six to eight weeks or clinical. Um, I, you know, I gotta tell you, man, I killed this dear, uh, anti tested positive. Yeah. Tested positive in the office.

Speaker 2:          01:28:20       That one's not cewd. That's not the one before that one. What is that Scott? Some of that was called, that's a cutaneous fibromas. Uh, there are tumors that grow on the surface of the skin. Pretty grotesque looking. Those are that, um, it's a virus. It's, well, if you get those awards and those fibromas on your eyes and they block your vision, it would be, but otherwise it's about, it's a stressor on animals and you can actually eat down there. Fine. But I don't think

Speaker 3:          01:28:51       chronic wasting disease that Jamie's got up there, the larger image, scroll down what it is that, um,

Speaker 2:          01:28:57       that's likely cwd. Yes, absolutely. Pick the one that's on the row underneath

Speaker 4:          01:29:02       the second one from the left. That one that the buck there. That's, yeah, that's, that's a photograph. No, you had on there. So that was taken by a game warden. Um, Michael A. Hopper is his name was in the state of Kansas and he's, you know, this diseases has a pretty decent footprint in Kansas as a game warden. He had gets calls about deer acting funny and so he's taken a number of good pictures. If you can zoom in on that photo, I don't know if you can look at what's coming out of that. Deer is mouth. See that stream of saliva that's all filled with infectious material. So that's one of the clinical signs is it's hypersalivation well, deer, that's a wild deer. So it's almost like this disease's trying to spread itself. It's been pretty efficient. Yeah, yeah. But, but by doing that, by forcing these animals to have all the saliva excretion, this is a very effective means of transmitting this disease throughout the, the set of characteristics of this whole disease where the protracted incubation period shedding infectious agents through bodily fluids for the majority of that incubation period, the, uh, the infectious agent persistently environment for years out to decades.

Speaker 4:          01:30:26       I mean, if you wanted to stack the deck for disease, you couldn't come up with a better set of characteristics. Plus they look perfectly healthy. So we have no idea. You know, that they're there that are diseased until later on in, in, in the disease progression. Now is there a prevalence in or is there a higher prevalence in deer versus moose versus a elk or anything else? We tend to see higher prevalence in the deer species, whitetail deer mule deer in isolated areas. Then we do in either elk moose, there's only been, you know, worldwide, there may be only been 10 positive moose okay. To date. And it's likely in a, and it doesn't seem that they're less susceptible, it's just that they're likely haven't been exposed because they're not in the same systems. And there are moose tend to be a solitary, solitary, definitely Wisconsin, you know, periodically a single a yearling, we'll, we'll wander down from a northeastern part of Minnesota, but very, very rare. What about wolves? Have Wolves contracted it yet? Wolves are interesting story. So, um, to date, there's no evidence that any Canaan, any member of the dog family has ever developed any TSC. They never got bse as far as we know. Uh, no evidence at any Canaan has gotten cwd. Now that could be a real observation. It could also be that we haven't done enough science on it. Okay. But there's certainly exposure as opposed to cats.

Speaker 2:          01:32:01       Um, in the BSE situation, both great cats and domestic cats got a TLC. We, it was referred to as feline spongiform encephalopathy and it was from consuming BSE contaminated meat. Okay. Very similar to how he wasn't mountain lions. Yeah. Great cats, which most certainly consumed. Yeah. Regular basis. Now in, in with cwt in North America, we, again, we have no evidence at any mountain lion or any great cat or small cat, um, has contracted cwd and facts. It's very interesting. In a research study in Wyoming that I was a part of, um, it turned out that the highest source of mortality for cwt positive deer was mountain line predation. And so somebody is going, ah, Aha. CWT doesn't always kill deer. Well, but it predisposes them. So think about that. Progressive neurological degeneration and think about how mountain lions hunt. They're ambush hunters. So if you're a deer and you're not quite right, you know, I mean this disease is developing in your brain, you're progressing progressive dementia.

Speaker 2:          01:33:07       It's not at the point where we are humanized, which really are very, very poor. We can't see disease yet, but disease is progressing and an ambush Predator can leverage that and take advantage of that. And that weakness in the prey. We see the same thing in Colorado. Um, studies have identified that cwt positive, do your tend to get hit by cars more often than cwt. Negative negativity. It, it's very logical. So now let's extend that to two wolves and asked the question, could wolves be a management tool for cwd? Okay. Wolves are present in northern Wisconsin. You know a lot of them over there, a lot of other locations and at some point wolves and cwd we'll meet. So there's been mathematical models developed, which are, there's a lot of assumptions built in those models, but it leaves it as an open question. Could a large coursing Predator who's vision and senses are much more acute than ours.

Speaker 2:          01:34:10       Could they take advantage of this disease in earlier stages? And so when disease meets geographically, Wolf's could wolves slow or maybe stop the progression of disease because they're taking the weak and the sick and the old still wouldn't stop the excretion and it still wouldn't stop all of the bodily fluids and they could they could they slow the spread or stop the spread? Maybe could they reverse disease? You could likely take all the predators. You could find wolves and mountain lions and dump them into Iowa county just south of where Doug lives and they likely would not be able to eliminate disease. But at that [inaudible] has disease spreads geographically at the interface. Could predators

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       be an effective tool to slow or stop disease from spreading? It's an interesting question. Especially when states are contemplating more aggressive control measures opening up hunting and trapping seasons to reduce population densities. So woes. So we don't have good tools and I'll leave it an open question. Do we want to take that potential tool and take it out of the tool? What about, what about, uh, okay. So, uh, Wolvercote well, coyote by us, you know, they're eating deer die in our woods and you know, from, we found a dead one, uh, last time Steve was there and I was very suspicious of it being a cw, cause it was a two and a half year old buck. It was laying there and it turns out it was probably hit by a car, but it was fairly well consumed by coyotes by then. Um, and I cut the head off of it and sent it in and it came back.

Speaker 4:          01:35:52       Non-Positive um, what happens when that coyote, which is going to travel while they're traveling huge distances, but, so he's eaten a cwd positive deer on the durian farm and he's running over to bunker hill seven or eight miles away because they do that and he takes us to dump over there. Yeah, we've done that. Science has been done and so it turns out if you take cwt, cwt positive material, you put it in the front end of a coyote, it comes out the backend of a coyote and it's still capable. It's still infectious. They still infectivity and it is capable of transmitting disease. You said mice don't get it. A rats eat coyote poop, correct? Yeah. Yeah. So they, they, they don't get it. Not that we're aware of. Um, there's a potentially spread it and their urine because they would be carrying it. So that, that kind of, and I have to ask you, you say he could eat cwd positive material, you could poop it out x number of hours later and he might be a mile or two away.

Speaker 4:          01:36:52       Okay. So that's a fairly local geographic phenomenon that could be spreading infectious material. Now you have to ask your self, you know, more questions when they defecate on the landscape. Is it dear likely to encounter and consume that material? Well, maybe not now, but it might be fertilizer two years down the road for plants if the deer could eat. So, but I think that's just quite restricted. It's a localized geographic phenomenon. Okay. And that's something that we can do a hell of a lot about. It's hard to, same thing with, with crows, you can put cwd in the front end of a crow or probably other scavengers and cwd comes out the back end about four hours later she could ask her Christoph the question, how far does it crow fly in for hours? And it is a deer likely to consume crow poop. So these had been shown to be possible in a laboratory environment, but how much they really apply out in the field is of Co of question. So we go back, we know that deer, the deer, the

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       deer, the deer, we see that slow diffusive process on the landscape. That's the biggie that's going on just south of him and now his past him. Then we have that answer. Pathetic movement, Yo humans moving long distances and the potential for agricultural commodities to be involved. I mean there's likely other things like crows and coyotes, I a proof of concept in a laboratory, but whether they're really happening in the field as an isn't entirely open question. And if they are, how big are they as compared to these other features?

Speaker 3:          01:38:30       So why not do the, you know, and, and, and some of the detractors will also say, well, you can't stop dear from doing dear activities. Right? And branches licking each other, uh, those, those, those normal dear activities. But if we're concentrating them in an area, let's say a mineral lick, um, where every deer in the area comes through there and then looks at in there or a feeder or a feeder, um, and you know, a bait pile. Um, uh, and, and we've seen bait. I mean, I've seen bait piles where there's a pile of corn. It was a pile of apples. Well, they're all eating off the same pie. You've got all these deer coming into that. That's something that we can do something about. There are all these natural movements that we can't do anything about, but if we can slow the spread by stopping these unnatural gatherings of, during these unnatural, you know, spreading of the disease, why wouldn't we do that?

Speaker 2:          01:39:32       Yeah. There's a few things. You know, you keep honing in on, you know, there's these anthropogenic factors and then what can we do where disease is truly his ear? The things you're talking about, the baiting and feeding artificial congregations of animals. Okay. Um, in where TB is in, in Michigan, you can't bait and feed. And in Wisconsin, some of the other states where cewd is, you can't bait and feed deer. The idea is you're artificially congregating them. So remember that single deer, we saw him up there on the screen is shedding Mayo, copious amounts of saliva. So if that deer goes up to a pile of corn on the ground, he's sharing spreading infectious agent into that corn. It can persist on that corn for a long, long time. Decades, healthy, naive, susceptible animal comes up at each set corner, licks that mineral lick and it's likely that that animal is ingesting viable infectious agent can transmit disease.

Speaker 2:          01:40:28       Um, the, the, the, the analogy there is, is his daycare. Okay, if you want to get your kid's sick, your three year old kids sick, what's the best place to do it? Send them to send them to daycare. Daycare is the analogy. There is that pile of corn on the ground. So if every child that ever goes to daycare is perfectly healthy, they're not little disease factories, but we know that's not the case. So they're in a great place in schools are a great place to spread disease and then those kids come home and share it with you and then you can share it with others. Right? Same thing there. So these artificial congregations, if all the deer healthy, we'll then, they can't be a place to transmit disease, but we know that's not the case. So it's an iguana. Those risk factors we can control.

Speaker 2:          01:41:17       But now you hit doug, you know, we get back to this area where disease is established. Is there anything we can do? And there's certainly things we can try, right? And we haven't, we haven't exhausted the toolkit yet. Um, Mike Samuel at uws and I now retired. Um, he, he looked at this from a mathematical perspective and he's trying to leverage the idea that adult males have higher prevalence, right? So there they are sync spur disease, they're gathering disease and then they're shedders of diseases. Well. So what if in our harvest regime, in hunting season, we focused on adult males. Okay, we hammer the bucks because they're the ones most likely to have disease. So we would lower prevalence and that we're reducing the proportion of the population with the highest prevalence of disease. The idea is if you knock that segment down enough that you would interrupt disease transmission cycles and you could actually lower herd prevalence over time.

Speaker 2:          01:42:23       Now you still have the persistence in the environment, but on from a modeling basis, it works. All right, so now think about the deer hunter out there listening to me today, listening to this show today. Oh, now they want us to go out and kill all the bucks. So it's not going to be a very desirable from a hunter's perspective tool. So all the tools we have, you considered these like medicine for bird disease. They're very bitter. It is a bitter pill. I, you know, you were there when we were still doing the wearing the Sombrero. If you, uh, you know, shot a smaller buck or whatever and uh, yeah, we had a management idea that we wanted to grow some bigger bucks, but at the same time we were pretty lenient about it. Um, we, we're not doing that anymore. The deer I shot last year were deer that seven, eight years ago.

Speaker 2:          01:43:16       I wouldn't even take another look at that first bucket shot. The first buck I had an ethical shot. Yeah. Or the I'm giving you more tags or give housing. Know there's resistance resistance in the hunting community to that. Um, that's unfortunate. It is unfortunate. Um, I'm not one of those, those people, we are in my part of the county deer advisory committee and we're giving more doterra eggs or antlerless tags because the other part of it, sure. We have a, uh, a population in the box that because their sinks as he said, and they're spreading the disease, um, and,

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       and they're traveling more, you know, a doe and her family tend to kind of stay in one area a little bit more where the bucks have a bigger range. Um, but the other thing is then is population. So one of the things that, for a couple of different reasons, I mean, you saw the number of deer that we have in our place in richland county. We have in excess of 75 deer per square mile of habitat. And I know there's places in the country that are higher than that, but, um, you know, it's, it's sort of a, it's a, it's a big population and I'm, I have issue with it for a few different reasons. One of them's disease. The other one is that when I have too many deer, my little oak trees are getting because they love those little oak trees and they're getting chewed off and I'm trying to do multiple things.

Speaker 3:          01:44:32       I'm not just trying to raise deer on our farm, um, and our woodlands. So, uh, you know, that, that's one of the issues. So there's this demographic issue that, that, uh, Mike Samuel, it had been working on, but then there's the population issue as well. Um, we're given four. When I, when I was a kid, when you bought up buck license, you and four other dudes would get together and then fill out this form and send it in and like August to get a, what was called a party tag. And you could shoot one doe between four people because we had, um, they were trying to manage the herd to, to have mortier. Cause again, when I was a kid seeing deer, it was a big deal. It's exact opposite now. So now you buy, you get a buck tag and you get for a antlerless tags with every tag that you buy in our county.

Speaker 3:          01:45:24       What changed from when you were a kid where the population exploded? Well, uh, management was a big part of it. Um, and the management exploded is, I mean, I'm going to be 60 years old. She was an exotic and look. Great. Well, thank you very much as the, you and Brian, you look pretty good too. Um, pretty good. Jamie on the other hand over that, I know he's still a young buck, no kid, but, uh, uh, I don't know. Of course, uh, that's a pretty long period of time. And when you, uh, when you're controlling because you don't have many deer and your managing to increase the deer herd and you have a mentality out there that will, I'm not going to shoot a dope because, you know, those are the, um, and they're having to fonts. And this year, at least in my area, we're seeing a lot of those having three fonts. That's, you can see how that growth of, of the, the herd.

Speaker 2:          01:46:26       Yeah. If you want to hurt to grow, stop shooting dose, if you want to take a her down, you know, shoot does, I'm gonna get back in Grad School in Illinois, they gave away these little pins that hunters collected. And when you brought a dough into the registration station, you got a pin that said, I shot a doe. So the herd won't grow. You know, people collected these little momentos during that time frame. Like I said, I grew up, uh, Yale, a couple counties to the north and west of where Doug was in, in the, in the 1960s. I mean, there weren't a lot of deer around there and watched, you know, as I grew up. Yeah. We, we didn't shoot many dose. The regulations in the state didn't allow you to shoot dose by 1980 on opening day. I remember I counted 160 dear on opening day, 15 years before that, probably saw three, something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:47:15       So exponential growth in the deer population over that point in time. The deer management program worked really well. Oh yeah. We know how to go out there. And that along with all of that that, that we've already talked about the agriculture and the agriculture expanded well agriculture but the uh, but you know, it was always there so it had the potential for all of the explosion. So, so there's a interesting, you know, I talk with folks in, in the state of Michigan and they've got a shoe, you know, pro relatively recent likely issue is cwd and yeah, there's user groups out there that are trying to advise the state on how to manage cwd. One of the groups is, is talking about, um, it's called antler point restrictions. Okay. The idea is a, you know, a yearling buck, 18 months old has fairly small antlers and then as they get older, they typically get successively larger antlers.

Speaker 2:          01:48:13       So a group is out there right now as an active proponent of implementing antler point restrictions and promoting antlerless harvest at the same time. Okay. As a disease management tool. So as we noted, you know, lowering the population that already how cwd is beneficial in it. If we have, if we have a herd of 500 animals with 10% prevalence, that's 50 positives versus a herd of 20 animals with 5% which would be one. And that's a dramatic difference. The prevalence is the same, but we have fewer positives out there. Right? So lowering populations overall does make sense with regard to disease. Okay. But now the other part of antler point restrictions is allowing males to get older. And they argue that that will keep hunters engaged. And if hunters are engaged, they'll shoot more dose and keep the population down and that'll be a good thing.

Speaker 2:          01:49:16       But you know, we've already discussed how adult males have tend to have the highest prevalence of cwd. Okay, that's fair. Now you're talking about promoting, pushing more males into these older age groups in an area where cwd has already known to exist. And so from a, from a biological perspective, from a numerical modeling perspective of disease, I failed to see how this can work. Um, so will keep in hunter's engaged. That's a sociological question that I can't really address. But from a purely biological disease driven process, promoting more older aged ma animals, older hd or in a population with cwd, I cannot figure out how that could be beneficial.

Speaker 1:          01:50:07       That seems the opposite. I'm hoping that through this podcast, this information becomes more digestible because I think that in order to get what you just laid out over two hours, in order for someone to get that by reading, it's like they're not going to do it. Most hunters are just not going to do it. And so I, I have a feeling that like what Ted nugent had said that this is a, the, his perspective is possibly way more prevalent than should be. And because this information is not that digestible, I think that there's, you know, the, I know you talked about it on meter episode 70 70 and then now today, this is going to reach a lot more people and it's in a very digestible form where they get to sit down and listen to it. And hopefully we can get the word out on this in a way that it's not getting out now. So people understand the consequences of this. This is a real issue. And it's, this is not simply like, hey, we don't want to do this because this could negatively impact our hunting opportunities. We might not have any hunting opportunities in 10 years or 20 years like this. This literally could devastate the entire population of deer. This is not, it's not a simple thing. This is an incredibly complex thing with a terrible disease that is 100% fatal and is absolutely spreading.

Speaker 2:          01:51:29       No question. Some of the, you know, the take home points, I always thinking and I get regularly asked by hunters, will, what can I do? Okay, well what a hunter's do. They sit at deer camp and they shoot the crap around, you know, whatever libations or whatever. So, and they're going to talk about things like cwd and good. So let those conver conversations be driven by fact and science as opposed to rumor and Innuendo. Right? Okay. That's what we're doing here to that. And that's why I think this public information is, is so important. There's other things it can do. We talked to doug hit on a bunch of them, you know, hunting as part of a, promoting a healthy deer herd. Can't haunting keep populations low. Test your deer and manage those carcasses. Don't leave them out on the landscape. There's another category though of things it can be done.

Speaker 2:          01:52:20       You know, in deer camp, what's the easiest thing to do is blame the dnr for everything. The Department of natural resources. Okay. It's, it's a, it's almost a sport to kick around at night and see who can insult the dnr the worst. Right? So it was regard to disease though. Is that really an effective use of your time? It might be fun, but it's likely not affected because think of the state management agencies that deal with deer. It might be the Agriculture Department or the natural department. They're very, very restricted in what they can do there within a legislator. Operate within a legislative framework. Okay. So if you really want to impact change in how a government agency goes about its business, should you talk to the local biologist or should you talk to the elected leader who establishes the legislative framework that that agency works underneath?

Speaker 3:          01:53:09       It's important to put pressure on, uh, on our elected representatives and, and we've seen change in that in well, Wisconsin being a great example. Um, are, uh, management used to be science based wildlife biologists making decisions about deer management. It's politically based. Now politicians are, are deciding what the, you'll, you'll often hear that in uh, I will county Wisconsin where this, this first effort started. Um, well see it didn't work up. Their dnr is, you know, they had this idea and it didn't work to stop the disease. It didn't get a chance to work because

Speaker 2:          01:53:45       social and political pressures and political stars forced the dnr to vacate their plants and their aggressive measures. And even more recently, and there's a, but it was a court case, uh, the state of Missouri, the Missouri Department of Conservation tried to implement some restrictions on the captive serving industry to stop importation of live deer seeing them as a risk factor. Um, the deer breeders sued the state, uh, went through the court system and, uh, it was decided by the Supreme Court in the state of Missouri, uh, about three weeks ago that in fact, all dear are, you know, reps or represent wild deer and that the Department of conservation was well within their constitutional and legislative authority to implement measures designed to protect the integrity and viability of that deer herd for future generations. So the Supreme Court said, yes, Department of Conservation, you do have the right to restrict import of animals into captive serve facilities to protect the integrity of the herd.

Speaker 3:          01:54:50       And it's the, the, the legislative part of it is really important and I can't put too fine a point on it. Um, laws can be changed and there's pressure to do that under lot of for you know, a lot of different reasons. I've been a part of changing some legislation it had to do with forestry and I know how it's done. Um, and you know, one of my favorite quotes from Ella Leopold is ethical behavior is doing the right thing even when no one's watching. And the wrong thing is legal. So just because it's legal doesn't mean it's the right thing to do and it doesn't mean it's the ethical thing to do. Is there any potential to changing the, the limits tag limits or making them more widespread if they understand the issue with this and they understand that one of the main tools of, of handling this in a more manner and

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       slowing the populate or slowing the spread of this disease, who the population at deer is reducing the population itself. It mean even the, the, these hunters would resist this because it would limit hunting opportunities. This could potentially be a large tool in the toolbox of conservation and stopping the spread. Short answer on that is yes. As I said, I'm on the county deer advisory committee. We have the opportunity to give out as many tags as antlerless tags is. We want, what about Antler tags? Cause that's the issue, right? One that's it. One per person is legislatively control. But even with this disease, which that might be the number one tool to, to slow down the spread. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:56:26       We used to have a um, a policy in uh, Wisconsin called earn and buck. And it was not particularly, uh, uh, uh, popular with a lot of hunters. Cause you know, I want to shoot my book and I don't want to have, shoot earn a buck. He had to shoot a doe a last year to earn a buck tag. Um, and it wasn't particularly popular. That's really a mild way to put it. Hmm. Well it was a post [inaudible] opposed by a very noisy group of hunters. Just like, and again, with my experience with working with the legislature, a small group of people making a hell of a lot of noise with a certain amount of money can change things. It wasn't popular. It was popular with me as well. Again, you hunted on my farm, um, we shoot way more antler of a steer that we shoot bucks.

Speaker 3:          01:57:22       Um, when when earn a buck was in place, we'd have a stack of buck takes because we were shooting so many dose. That was because it was politically or socially, uh, became a political issue. Um, it was rescinded. And so now what we found in Richland county is we can give, we could drop antlerless tags from a helicopter to shoot as many as you want and we're still gonna kill. But the same number of those about the same number of dose, every, there was a little bit and there's been a little bit of an uptick. But when we had earned a buck, we killed a shitload of them, you know, three times as many. And, um, it becomes a, and I understand, especially like casual hunters, like, you know, gun hunters are a good example. Bowhunters or you know, different example because they're not as casual, but they're more interested in, in, you know, killing the big, big buck a generally, um, uh, gone hunters.

Speaker 3:          01:58:24       Yeah. You go out there for two or three days. I mean, you were there and we froze our asses off. I mean, it's like, well, how long am I going to stay out here? We have a really short season. We initially had much longer season when, when the cwd management first started, we had a much longer season. I loved it. Um, I, I got to hunt with folks that, you know, that, that maybe had their own place to hunt where I invited folks from the community to come in and hunt. Uh, you know, friends from different places came down and hunted. But again, a small noisy group. Um, and I dunno, smallest, I don't know what the numbers are in that, but, um, made that go away. So now we're back down to the 90 season. It doesn't make any sense to me. Like who, who gave into that? The politicians, politicians understand

Speaker 2:          01:59:10       and they're doing it from an ignorance, from point of ignorance, political pressure, political pressure. I've got to hope that something like this podcast gets to them. I sure hope so. Man. I'm not sure why we came out. This is a terrifying couple. Couple of Erica. So the Wisconsin experience was really important and the data shows that the first couple of years, so they say aggressive management with earn a buck was actually forcing the population down, but it was very unpopular. And so, um, political pressure was applied and that tool was taken out of the toolbox thrown on the ground. Immediately. When you stop doing, uh, earn a buck and you stopped having longer seasons, the population trends reversed and started going back up. So it was easy to label, Hey, the dnr failed their effort to eliminate disease by, by having aggressive seasons failed. Like Doug said, we don't know that because we stopped.

Speaker 2:          02:00:11       We pulled the plug on the tool, Alberta, when the wind cwd started really blossoming in Saskatchewan, Alberta was like, we don't want it. And they found their first handful of cases right on the border between Alberta and Saskatchewan. They took, they raise the odds a little bit. They started harvesting deer from an aerial platform called a helicopter. Okay. That helicopter with government agents, sharp shooting deer to try and basically eliminate deer in a buffer zone between Saskatchewan and Alberta, knock the disease, deer out and create a buffer zone where disease wasn't well, that was not very popular either. Like a Fart in church and uh, land owners and outfitters went to the ministry and said, we can't possibly have this. And that program I had every chance of being successful and the rug was pulled out from underneath them. Okay. So now here we have time.

Speaker 2:          02:01:09       Sure. We are, uh, you know, years later and the western states, you know, Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, where disease has been a long time. Their wildlife health professionals, I have put together a set of uniform management recommendations for the western states came and they're promoting the things that we've been talking about, reducing those artificial congregations of animals, implementing a harvest structure to focus males. Okay. The male focused the most, the social group with the highest prevalence and also kind of what I guess I would refer to as hotspot shooting. When you see a new spark of disease out there on the landscape, get on it. Don't allow it to become established. Your only chance to be successful to eliminate disease is very, very soon before it gets established. And Starch, you know, spreading. So now we're seeing in Wyoming and Colorado and Montana, they're actively talking, they're talking to the media, they're talking to their commissions and they're talking about implementing these regulatory structures at least on an experimental basis, recognizing that doing nothing

Speaker 3:          02:02:20       is no longer an option. And that's one of the things that was learned from the Wisconsin experiment, for lack of a better word. Um, that are our failure. I mean, you know, the analogy that I often use is, you know, we had this, we had this car and it was, you know, pretty decent car. That's pretty decent model of how we were going to control the disease. But you know, they kind of let the oil go out of the car and they ran it into, rented in the ditch and banged it around and then brought it up and say, damn, this Ford doesn't run worth a shit. And if you can't actively tried to defeat something and then say it doesn't work, you really have to let it, you know, this is of course, and in Whiskey, what I hope that what's happening and what I can see is in, you know, in the 15 years that I've learned about cwd is that not only is there a lot been learned about the disease, but there's been a lot learned about how to manage it both on a scientific level but on a social level as well.

Speaker 3:          02:03:17       And I can tell you, man, if you don't have it, you don't want it. Um, you know, 15 years ago I felt, and there's so much more known now than there was 15 years ago. Um, you know, I feel like we, it's not too late in Wisconsin. I mean, we can keep slowing it down and we can protect the rest of the state. But, um, we get a lot of work to do and it takes a well, it, but it really doesn't take the medicine was very bitter, I think technical information to, because I don't think people are really aware of the extent of this disease or the danger of it or all the ramifications of it. I agree. I agree. I'm surprised in my area intelligent people that I know that are casual hunters. Yeah. So it's getting to be deer hunting time and I'll talk to them what I'm like, ah, they don't really, well, you know, they don't know. They don't know. Yeah. That, yeah. And that really is one of the things. So, you know, I appreciate so much the opportunity to come out here and talk about it. And, and Brian and Mike Samuel, um, are going to come to a regional center in September, which is the capital or a county seat, I'm sorry, of Richland County. And we're going to do, uh, another, uh, presentation on chronic wasting disease and we're advertising it. Y, you know, widely and more of that information has to get an education, a big part of Joel. You're exactly right.

Speaker 4:          02:04:39       Yeah. Just don't think there's enough digestible education. And I think this sort of form is one of the most digestible, oh, you have to do is you put it on your car and drive around, you listen to it, you put it in your headphones and you're at the gym, you'll get this information, you'll get an a and M in a way that you're probably not going to sit down and go through these studies. And I appreciate it as well. I mean to, I'm pretty, uh, not very savvy on social media and things like that. I wasn't even sure what a podcast was when Steven Rinella, you asked me to come on and do meat eater. And so we did that. And um, I, I understand now it's been downloaded like 650,000 times. Okay. Which for a scientist, you know, I've been an author on a lot of peer reviewed papers and I can guarantee you they haven't been read.

Speaker 4:          02:05:30       You take a couple zeros off of there and that's probably the readership on those snakes. So from an impact, being able to get a message out to people, this type forum really, really is helpful. And getting it down, like you say, down to a level that hunters can understand and digestible I think is very, very important. Um, cause I w o he talked about how misinformation, active misinformation to try and, you know, it's not so bad or look over here, don't look at this, look over there. You know, these diversionary tactics are very, very successful. They were very successful with tobacco. They were successful with other scientific endeavors, you know, today and also the simplistic perspective that hey look how many deer get killed by winter. You know, it's way more than cwd stop, stop crying wolf. Yeah. So diversionary tactic,

Speaker 3:          02:06:17       I'd like to bring up about that. Um, I've killed some big deer and uh, I get it. Guys want it. People want it. Hunters want to do that. Don't want to kill.

Speaker 4:          02:06:29       That's what they look forward to it. They look forward to hunting season. It's only one time a year.

Speaker 3:          02:06:33       Yup. And you get to do that as we're not just hunters, we're conservationists. What we do is going to affect the future and we have an obligation to do what's best for the resource and what's best for the future. Um, and I'll tell you this, last year I shot a two and a half year old buck opening day. And, uh, this is a nice little eight pointer and I celebrated that deer. I enjoyed that year. I remember that moment just as much as the 200 inch block that I killed. It's, it's different. But it concerns me that at times we get so wrapped up and I was one of a man, I feel like a recovered alcoholic sometimes about the whole aler thing, you know, like, hi, I'm doug and I used to be a and step process. Well, and there, you know, there is a part of that.

Speaker 3:          02:07:23       Yeah. But remember what the joy of hunting is and the, the, the, the reason for it and how important it is to make sure that that continues into the future. Um, there've been some folks who really, you know, sounded huge alarms about this and you know, you talked about it a little bit. Yeah. 20 years from now, it could, you know, it could be, well it might take a generation or two, but it really could become that. Um, I want to be able to eat the meat and I want to know that in future generations, you know, a hundred years from now and that farm is still there and it's still in the during name, it's been in my family for 115 years. I want to know that a hundred years from now that my descendants and their friends and their family are going to be able to come there and still enjoy that and in order for that to happen, just like when I'm managing my oak trees so that a hundred years from now there's going to be those big Oak Tree Sarah again a hundred years from now, we have to do what we need to do now in order for this opportunity, be there for the future.

Speaker 4:          02:08:27       Our hunting heritage is huge. Not to mention that the financially, that the economics of of deer hunting in a place like Wisconsin, there's over 650,000 people that hunt deer. They pump in excess of $1 billion every year into the economy of the state of Wisconsin surrounded by hunting. If we put that on a national basis, there's millions of hunters and more billions of dollars spent. So it's not a small thing when you think about, you know, the economics of hunting. But the heritage of hunting is very, very important. I mean, I, I've been hunting my whole life. Yeah. Yeah. Now I hunt. Uh, primarily one county was to him and you know, cwd has coming. I'd say I'm sitting in my tree stands three years ago and Cwt is in the next county. Over two years ago, the first cwt positive deer in Crawford County, Wisconsin was detected, um, less than two miles to the southwest of the tree that I'm sitting in. Last year, cwd had been detected in another, in a secondary in Crawford County. This time, one mile to the northeast of where my tree stand is. I find myself looking at deer differently. I'm looking for those subtle queues, a disease, and it, they say it's changing the experience I get. I get calls pretty regularly from, from hunters who are like, you know, really it's a coin flip out there.

Speaker 3:          02:09:54       I'm not so sure I want to hunt there anymore or no, because I'm on the deer advisory committee. A group of hunters came in who bought land south of us, you know, uh, 20 miles south of us in a significant portion and they're doing, uh, they were, they bought it to manage it for, for bigger box, um, and population and all of that. They came into the county deer advisory committee and talk to us about what they're doing. They shot 43 deer on that property last year. All of the box tested, all the antler bucks tested positive for Cwd, um, about 25%

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       of the dose and some of the Fonz. So a doe fawn who as cw who has cwd and she's going to be clinical and die in two years, she's never going to have funds of her own. That's the population issue. But what I, you know, I hope those guys are listening. Um, what I plotted about them is what they've done is really worked with bringing in other people and I'm going to do the same on our place. Um, bringing in more people to hunt, um, to, to take more deer and to do what they can manage it because they saw it. Well the, and what, they're not seeing big old bucks anymore cause they're dead. They're dying, they're finding them, but they're finding them dead. We've seen that in and a Wyoming in, I mean what we look at, the longterm impacts had disease. And I talked a little bit about population impacts driving population down.

Speaker 2:          02:11:26       The other you're saying we would identify is changes in that demographic structure. So you know, when you were hunting for the big antlered deer, you're looking for animals that are four or five years old and mature over mature animals in an area where cwt as established at high prevalence levels, those animals are not going to exist or what would be extremely, extremely rare. They're rare. Now, here's an example of a, a real large ranch out in Wyoming and there's about a hundred thousand acres and eight managed historically, exclusively for these over mature mule deer. You know the ones with the antlers, you know like that monstrous muled there. Even in the good times, they probably killed maybe three of them a year, something like that. On that vast acreage because you know there's a lot of sources of mortality. They're not anymore because you, you know those deer living that long.

Speaker 2:          02:12:21       I think about it at math question, math quiz for, for, for during here. So in this population with super high prevalence, so let's say at 18 at 18 months of age, yearling deer, let's say they have 20% prevalence, and we have that, we demonstrated that at two and a half, it's probably 30% prevalence at three and a half and four and a half and above it's, it's close to 40 45 50% prevalence. So this is a two year disease, right? So half your prevalence dies every year. So if you have 20% prevalence, half of those deer are going to be dead the next year, half the year after that. Okay. So over time you would expect these cohorts to diminish. So the math question is in that population, how many five year old bucks are there? Because disease penetrance grows over time. The answer's not meant. It's not a, I'm supposed to. It's a sound. The alarm. Yeah, yeah. No. And that, you know, that really is the case and it's, it's, uh, I, I, you know, again, that's why I wanted to bring along, because he's

Speaker 3:          02:13:31       going to provide the science and I'm going to try to break it down to, you know, Doug's level and, and hopefully that, you know, folks can understand it and I know I get emotional about it, but, you know, part of it is, yeah, well my dad would be 94 years old today and he's the guy that I started deer hunting with. You know, he died a couple of years ago and I, he grew up with that farm, you know, it was my great grandfather's farm in that area, in the driftless area. And you've heard me talked about the driftless area before and how important that area is to me. And this is a big part of that area. It is an emotional thing for me, which is why I then look at the science and what can we do about this? And I think about, you know, I think about Elva Leopold, what leopold do right now.

Speaker 3:          02:14:19       I mean, what would he be thinking about this? You know, what am I old man? I'd be thinking about this, you know, I know what my dad would be saying. He always sat my, my antler thing was bullshit. Every time he'd see a bucket on the trail, chemical shooter, you just, he just like, he was just an old school buck hunter, man. He did an antler on it. You shot it. So all those things are in my head as I think about this. And, uh, you know, it's, it's the emotion's important and I get the emotion part from all of these, these, these folks. Um, and I understand that some of them want to kill big bucks. And, and you know, maybe because I have killed a couple of big ones, that's it's not as important. Maybe. Maybe it has something to do with being 60 years old and maybe you understand the consequences.

Speaker 4:          02:15:01       This is a real serious issue. Forget about the ego of killing a big buck or you know, this desire to achieve something that's more difficult than shooting a young one. There's more at stake here. Yeah. So you brought up an interesting, what would leah do and he, I mean this disciple, you know, father of modern wildlife ecology started the first program of Wildlife College at University of Wisconsin in the 1940s populations of deer in the northern part of Wisconsin. We're growing by leaps and bounds and they were dramatically changing the landscape. PM denuding the landscape, you know, eating eastern white cedar and deer in northern latitudes tend to yard together in the wintertime. And so leopold knew that this was deleterious to the longterm viability of that ecosystem. He took people out, landowners out in hunters out into these deer yards in the spring to show them how there was nothing to eat within reach.

Speaker 4:          02:16:04       Of a deer on a hind feet and there were bodies of dead deer that it stopped through the wintertime in order to demonstrate to them the consequences of mismanagement if deere hurts. So he, he was a real proponent of showing people the results of doing things the wrong way and education. So I think, yeah, it comes back, it's what we're trying to do. Not saying that, yeah, we're leopold in or anything like that, but education, getting information out, getting accurate information out as maybe one of the biggest things we can do. I think you guys did down here today. So thank you. Thank you for being here, Brian. Thank you doug for organizing that together. I'm really happy we got a chance to talk and scare the shit out of me. Thanks for the opportunity. My pleasure. Thank you guys. Thank you.
