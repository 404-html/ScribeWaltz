Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Bam, all right. We're live, ladies and gentlemen with a whole new setup. A. Yeah. Yeah. When they listen man, I'm very irresponsible. You know, it's gonna be really cool is when we get something right back here. That's the next step. We're trying to figure out what to put right back there. Most likely is going to be a green screen because I'm looking at this right now. I'm like, how dope would it be if we were in fucking space right now? We can have like captain Kurt ship behind us like late also. We have a real desk. Um, we have real microphones now, so, uh, the iphone version and IPAD and I, whatever the fuck you use, MP3 is going to be much better, much clearer. And we're fucking fired up. We are not sponsored by starbucks. This is just coincidence that we have to happen to have that. But we have had an offer for our very first sponsor and it is the fleshlight awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:00:54       I got some funny to tell you, Joe, by the way. Hold on a second. We've got to tell people. So the fleshlight

Speaker 1:          00:00:59       is, uh, if you don't know what it is, if you're, you're, you're not a, an online type person, it's a, a very famous device that you can fuck. And uh, one of the reasons why it's famous because it's supposed to feel really good. It's supposed to feel like way better than your hand. And the other reason is that there was that, that thing that was online, like I accidentally the whole flashlight.

Speaker 2:          00:01:22       What was that Guy Pranking? Uh, I think it was a customer service rep that a saying only as something that he, he is a flashlight or something like it was a really bad accident. No flush Elo Carola. Well cat, well this guy

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       watched that or heard that thing or remember it. But I do remember that that fleshlight thing got stuck in my head because of that because everybody kept saying it. And uh, it just, it's, it's like one of those things where like, you, you know, you hear about it so often on the internet just because of that. So when they contacted me I was like, wow, that's kinda cool. Then when he told me that he sponsored a Kevin Smith podcasts, I'm like, wow, that's super cool. Like he's going to do our podcast and Kevin Smith's podcast. That sounds fucking bad ass. And then we met the dude and Chris was a super cool guy and uh, you know, uh, just a real chill do that you could hang with like a normal guy. And he was really a kind of a spiritual guy too, which is kind of interesting because we were talking about the porn side and how, you know, porn is kind of gross, you know, there's a lot of porn now that you don't

Speaker 2:          00:02:25       really would necessarily want to be associated with either really good at his job researching you because he seemed like your long lost brother document because he was like pulling out documentaries you didn't even know about, like books that I didn't know about when that was the weird, like you guys would be good for. You guys were gay. You'd be perfect. Perfect Lover, lover. Yeah. Yeah. He was

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       real bright guy, man. When we talked about me and Musashi, we talked about different schools of philosophy, different books that he's read. Yes. Different. Uh, different volcanoes. He knew about some super volcanoes exploding in the past that I didn't even.

Speaker 2:          00:02:57       Right. You got to get them on the shelf.

Speaker 3:          00:02:59       Yes, definitely. He, unfortunately, he lives in Austin, but the next time we're in Austin, what we'll do is we'll bring our equipment and everything is set up in Austin or we can move there. I fucked up. I fucked up moving to Colorado for a bunch of reasons. One, because Mrs Rogan can't fucking drive in the snow, which is just a, it's not good. And if you know Mrs Rogan, that's not something that I'm going to be comfortable with her learning really quickly. Just that doesn't seem like a good move. Just fucking moving where it's freezes and shit gets dangerous and sliding the trees and shit. And then when the dog, when the dog got eaten by the mountain lion, that killed it. Yeah. Otherwise, Austin would have been great. And if our. Anyway, the point is if Austin was great, we would definitely hang around with Chris Kelly,

Speaker 2:          00:03:43       but what's funny is he gave us a sample so we can feel and touch it of the flashlight and the fleshlight uses patent and rubber technology. They have a patent on this shit. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:03:53       It's a very specific type of insert. The bushy squishy stuff has their own proprietary blends.

Speaker 2:          00:03:59       Yeah, and it's like you, you think in your head like, Oh, I'm sure it feels like rubber and oil. Like it's not gonna. It's just gonna feel like really soft rubber. This actually is kind of creepy to feel it. Was He. He gave us a sample. What he did is he took a couple of flashlights and he cut it in half just so we can feel the actual rubber part and then at the end of our dentists and really feel like puts you though. It felt. It feels soft. Yeah, it feels really good. It feels really. Hasn't even moved up though. No, it's not even lose. So he gave us the samples too. Mushy. It's like a pushy that sick. Well because it's usually in a can. It's usually, it's, it's got some bonus

Speaker 3:          00:04:31       behind you want like, oh, but wouldn't, would that make it more clear?

Speaker 2:          00:04:35       Yeah. Yeah. Because you have like a wall right now. We actually have a box of them. Yeah. So anyways, he gave us these samples, just a few of them and we left them on the table and I'm like, you're not going to take that. And he was like, Oh, you know, it's just trash just so you can see like, you know what I'm going to take it. So I took the samples and I had it there in a bag and the other day, uh, I decided when no one was around that I would try to fuck one of the samples, but it was only half of it. So have you used both of them? One for the bottom and one for the top. And so it's doing the left hand and the right hand left hand was the left sample, the right with the right sample.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       And I'm like, wait a second, fleshlight company you need something like that. Because I had like two different hand jobs going on. I had one with a different texture on the top. One on yourself off with two hands like you're milking. Milking a cow will. How you work in the balls. It's hung on the bottom. I put the balls in the bottom one. I wrapped it around the bottom one. So it's kind of to your balls around the bottom one. How fucking smaller balls. They're very, very small, but I was doing both of them. I used to eat a lot of Nmr. You remember the falls? She cried, but anyways, it felt really real. I only had hot water and lube. Yeah, for a loop, but it felt really good, like shampoo or something I'm good at because it's supposed to be a water based oil and that. So they felt good for even just being samples outside of its cocoon and everything. It wasn't even in the can or anything, so I can't wait to fuck one of these things. Is this one of them right now? These are. These are the ones.

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       This is not without some controversy. I don't. This is actually going to be really loud, so to speak softly as possible. I'm willing to do it

Speaker 1:          00:06:08       so it's not annoying. This is a. apparently this is a, this is the fleshlight wow. It comes in a nice packaging like, like, are you going to do an unboxing video for us, Joe? Yes. We'll do the flashlight. Let's see what we got here. Now this is not without some controversy and this is where it gets strange. Um, my manager is very, very upset with me. Yeah. And does not think that the fleshlight is a good thing to have for a sponsor. And um, I was surprised with that because they were like really adamant about it. They were like, you could be up for some sort of a show cbs and they find out that you have the flashlight on, on your podcast. You know, that you're sponsored by a thing, not just that you have an opinion about a thing. They were saying that the big deal is that you are sponsored by this thing and because you're sponsored by this thing somehow or another that makes you like, what does that make you? A bad person? Yes. Because you don't masturbate your hand. Yeah. You're, you're, you're a bad person because you preferred to masturbate with the rubber vagina. Right. Like really

Speaker 2:          00:07:16       old school.

Speaker 1:          00:07:17       It's crazy talk, right? Like, it's crazy the idea that you don't masturbate if you don't masturbate. What's wrong with you? Like it's a, it's a great. Feels good. Okay. First of all to. It's a great way of getting a release, like a sexual release. So it's not built up. It's on annoying you all day because if you're not getting laid. Okay. And a lot of us aren't. If you're not getting laid and you don't jerk off, you're going to go fucking bananas. Right? Yeah, that's, that's a fact. It's totally fair. So what is this some sort of a leftover purity?

Speaker 2:          00:07:44       Yeah. Don't show your ankles, your ankles. Technology. Fucking

Speaker 1:          00:07:48       put dresses over the legs of chairs. You ever seen those, those buildings where they put or those, uh, old uh, um, like furniture from like, you know, I don't know what year it was, way, way, way back in the Victorian era. I guess when they put, they would literally put dresses around the legs of chair,

Speaker 2:          00:08:02       a place like lacey so that people don't get excited by fucking chair, but it was like Brah you remember go to your grandmother's house and seeing like that old white croquet kit table was. What was it called? It was kind of like a white lacey, you know, old people. Dolese. Is that what is doily?

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       I don't think it's the same thing. I don't think. Oh, look at you. You're doing it. Any Bravo right now? You fuck you. Fuck my sits on airplane mode. I thought, oh well I'm going to put them on there.

Speaker 2:          00:08:30       So yeah. So they used to put doilies type shit on furniture that was almost like lace of a bra to cover up the. The ankles of a chair or a leg of a table. Crazier people. How fucking

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       crazier people and how crazy is that? Me Of all people, like all the shit that I've talked about from fucking dmt to the fact that I think the government, Kennedy and the same people are probably in power and giant fucking corporations control the world. And

Speaker 2:          00:09:00       you have a video of you and me watching two girls and one cup and then you showing no, you've got to watch a video of a Guy Cha

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       chopping off their debt, but yet you can't masturbate. That's okay. But masturbation is terrible. It's, it makes no sense at all of all the shit that I'm put it up on the Internet. I try to be as honest as possible and I try to put as much on the Internet about things that I'm interested in. I don't care if you think I'm crazy and out there. I don't care if you know, you think it's inappropriate or look, I'm just curious about this certain subject. Here it is. Whether it's on my message board or whether we're talking about on this, this, this, a podcast or whether we put it on twitter, you know, if I find something, I think it's interesting. I'm going to be honest about it. Like why is that a fucking bad thing? You know? And why is the idea of me fucking this rubber flashlight? Why is that a bad thing?

Speaker 2:          00:09:48       Because I don't think people in Middle America wants to think of you masturbating and then if that gets thrown in their faces. Yeah, because you're not supposed to hand in their face. You're not supposed to have sex too.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       So that's what it is when, when you don't want people to see people having sex or talking about sex too much and if you endorse sex with yourself, that's a bad thing. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:10:09       I, I, to me it's like, I mean, you can't marry that with the craziest.

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       The thing is they said, the manager said that, uh, that one of the things that we're talking about was the fact that this isn't the pornography industry. That's what they said. It's the pornography that it's pornography. And I said, how is it involved in pornography industry? It's, it's like it's just a rubber vagina. They're like, well, when you use it you watch pornography.

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       So that was an actual argument. So, so like how can we can't do it? You can either do it with your imagination. It has to involve pornography. Joe, how many, how many documentaries have you done on DMT and drugs? So the drug industry's okay, but the porn industry, the Janet Jackson Nipple industry is just out of control. Insane. It's why.

Speaker 1:          00:10:50       I don't know what you just said. You might pay a little bit too much to talk right now. You know what I'm saying? Many rambled with your women's documentaries. Have you done about drugs? I've done. So the drug industry to your managers fine with drug industry is not really an industry. Well, the idea is that a documentary is different because it's just your opinion on a certain subject. Whereas this is an endorsement. That's the argument. Endorsement endorsements were endorsed by marijuana. Was marijuana is illegal. You are endorsed by marijuana and endorsement. Marijuana. Marijuana. Actually none of the only sponsors this show. It writes most of the material and causes most of the things to happen. And he's the producer with marijuana is the senior producer. Train wreck. Train wreck. This week it was green crack, crack. Crack is executive producer, secret executive producer of this show this week. Yeah. No Shit. So, so this is a real argument right now. The real argument is that if I endorse this thing that somehow or another, it would be a bad thing. Packaging on. That's. I think that's the butthole is have, but maybe that's the vagina. Wow. This is a super tight. No. Can we just touch it and they put. They

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       give me one and a half. I've been wearing them. I don't want to have her. Do you have a loop? A One? Have a loop. Hey, if you guys know Lupus. She was on the Howard Stern show.

Speaker 3:          00:12:01       It's like Christmas. Listen, this ain't no motherfucking clear. The table of all the junk. This is way less annoying than the way I used to have. Yeah, there's some junk on the table. How about this? I'll take this out. Move this out of the way with that helping. It does look a little bit if I do that. How about that? I'm cleaning up for you guys. That's the difference between the ustream crowd and the iphone. IPAD, ipod crowd. So that's the flashlight fellow. Fuck it.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       I got the stamina training unit. Did you have to practice v longer in bed? It says, every man knows, the only way to get better is to practice view can last 10 minutes in the unit. You can last 20 minutes in bed with anyone.

Speaker 3:          00:12:43       Wow, that's bold. That's strong words. That was one of the things that this guy was telling us. What's one of the more fascinating things about this whole thing was the actual therapeutic applications of the flashlight, and this sounds like nonsense. Sounds like someone's just justifying trying to fuck a rubber pussy, but know what they use them for a bunch of different therapeutic reasons. And one of them is a, people in certain religions aren't allowed to touch their penis and because they're not allowed to touch their penis. These guys, he said that his city Jews in particular actually have a hard time, um, orgasming when they have sex with women because they're so used to like fucking pillows because they do most of their masturbation like grabbing a sheet or grabbing a pillow. This is his words, not mine. This, this could be totally nonsense. I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:13:28       I have not researched this at all. That's my caveat. But he said that, um, the flashlight is actually covered by some insurance policies as therapy, as sexual therapy, to get them to learn how to orgasm with a vagina instead of fucking like some rough pillow. So I don't know. I have not validated this. I don't know whether that's true. Yeah, it totally makes sense to me. And the other reason for the fresh flashlight is it trains guys not to prematurely ejaculate. And guys who have problems with premature ejaculation, they can practice in the flashlight. That's the idea. You're supposed to take this to.

Speaker 2:          00:14:05       Oh, that doesn't, doesn't feel good.

Speaker 3:          00:14:07       Metal plastic card asked him. Yeah, don't get too crazy. Pull your Dick outside. I'll fucking panic. So, um, so I don't think there's any. Look, obviously we all masturbate. It's, it's silly at this point in this stage of life to, to deny that it, it's, it's, it doesn't make any sense. It's dumb. So if we all masturbate, what is the, what's wrong with this thing? You know, what's wrong with this?

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       You know what's crazy? I do things like smoke cigarettes are used to smoke cigarettes in the car and have a of of my hand. I think therapeutically I can put this in my car instead of smoking cigarettes. Just finger. It doesn't feel so good. I mean, don't touch my butt. I mean that's something to do with my hand. Like, like, like that feels good. That feels like I'm playing with like one of those stress balls, but it actually feels like I'm 10 percent woman doing it. Wow. Touching on strong numbers. Let's strong number son. I think there is a lot of things like that because there was something else you were saying about people. A lot of medical reasons. Like was something else that he said besides that, uh, religion. There was like doctors that would use it for a while. The, we already recovered that. Doctors use it for premature ejaculation and religions that don't masturbate. You're way too high on lady here. He blasted. Seems distracted. That's why I tried to keep the ipad away from him. I told you I took one too many hits today. He did take one to many and went over the deep end king outside.

Speaker 1:          00:15:31       It's my fault. Um, so what, what I don't understand. And I don't wanna I don't wanna I definitely wanna hear from you guys. I'm just let me know on twitter at Joe Rogan. I'm just my name now. Joe Rogan. He used to be doc.net [inaudible] dot net because some dudes cybersquatting on my name but I got it back. Thank you very much. Twitter, my account got verified and all that shit. Um, but I, I want to know, do you think it's ridiculous because I think it's ridiculous. And what is there? Is there really a bunch of you out there that would not want to see something and I'm doing whatever the fuck it is because you know that I support rubber pussies. Like is it possible that that could cost somebody's business? I mean in this day and age when the fucking pope. Okay, it's not being brought to justice for shielding child molesters. You're really going to get upset at me if I endorse her rubber pushing me. The pope has endorsed by the goddamn presidents of every goddamn country in the world and this guy shielded, shielded pedophiles. I mean, it's a fact. He did. He's a, he's a part of the problem with the Catholic Church. That motherfucker is accepted everywhere, but I'll be about, am I comparing myself to the pope? I guess I am. Folks. I just fucked up.

Speaker 2:          00:16:35       I did. I don't know why there's some grandy grandiose delusions of grandeur in my head. I connect my because I've always wanted aware of it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       Dope as robe show, show up for work dressed like a marilyn. But you know, I don't think there's anything wrong with masturbating. Obviously you don't either. We all, we all do it. I don't think there's anything wrong with a product that makes masturbation easier or better. And that's what it is. I support it and you know, so I'm, I'm, I'm not going to listen to my managers. I'm gonna tell him

Speaker 2:          00:17:03       go fuck themselves. But he made it, but I love them. You made an awesome point like women in their dildos and vibrators that almost, you know, when people get married at like bachelor parties and stuff, that's like a joke, you know, that's like, that's their toy. Guys have never really had any, any, any, any real legit toys. You know, it's true. This is the first one that actually makes sense. Instead of using your hand. When did you use something that feels 100 times better? Yeah, that is the art and I can't wait to fuck it and I may get a cantaloupe, put it in the microwave, microwave, put a little hole in it and warm it up a little and we fucked that first. Wait a half hour and then fuck this and see which one's better. Cantaloupe is your move, right? You've done that before. I've done it before. It's great because you. After you fuck it, you could totally eat it, so I just wash it out. Don't even layer, don't eat, don't eat, don't eat the layer rude. Someone calling during my fucking

Speaker 5:          00:17:50       podcast. I would shut that off. I knew it was cliche management. They're there. They're listening to the podcast right now, like, hey man, let's talk about this man. Put this out there. That's funny that your managers. That's cool. That doesn't stop because you'd start talking to that. No, just

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       listen. That's hilarious. It's hilarious. They called right when we're talking about, you know, I see what they're saying. They're trying to protect me from like, you know, like if I had to do a show like fear factor or something like that, maybe that could be a problem. Yeah. But you'd still. Producers Horses. Dick's. Yeah. I feel like you got to take me as I am. You know, I'm not a bad guy. Whenever you don't want to do some sort of. I don't want to do a fear factor again. I really don't. I mean it's so tempting not to for the money, but I got to do something more interesting. I got to do shit that I like doing because I have so much more fun. So it's almost like getting in bed with a flashlight. It's like protects me from doing anything stupid that I know I'll do for money. You know? It's just so easy when something like fear factor comes along and they're like, hey, we're going to give you all this money every week and only have to do is just show up and watch people do stupid shit. You're like, fuck, it's so easy to get that money. It's so difficult, but you have got a pass on it. You really do. Because if it was good that I did it, but at a certain point in time you have to pass on doing those things because if you don't, you're just going to be better.

Speaker 5:          00:19:16       You're talking about, by the way, you're talking about old TV while you while you're doing new TV. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:19:23       This is way easier. This look, we could have never had a fucking show like this that reaches as many people as this thing does. Including the, um, you know, the podcast on itunes and this thing on ustream and there's, there's no fucking way we could have ever gotten someone to agree to let us practice a TV show. This is what we're gonna do. We're gonna start off just fucking around with boxes of shit behind me, piled up on the desk and that eventually we're going to move on to like try to have like a real show, like a desk and real microphones and the sound is much better. We got to like a top end MP, three recorder and then the next thing we got ustream producer. We're going to have high def cameras in here and eventually we're going to figure out how to do it all through a tri caster so that we can have a background and we'll put a green screen up behind us.

Speaker 1:          00:20:07       We never thought that this was going to happen. This is just a goof and and this. This is not that. This is any big deal like this could have happened, but it's this easy and this fun and people would enjoy this much. You could never. I could have never done this on television. They would've never let me, and if they did, they would never let me just do it the way we did it. Just wing it and talk about whatever. For the first fucking 10 weeks we didn't even have plan what we're going to talk about. We would just get in there, turn it on and just talk about it, you know. So I completely lost what the fuck I was talking about. I completely lost what I was saying. My. I know what my point is. My point is that this is new TV and you're right and it protects me really if I do something like the flashlight or any of the ridiculous should I do it protects me from doing any dumb fear factor type shit in the future.

Speaker 2:          00:20:52       It's so funny because there is a pretty direct line on the old TV where the new tvs mixing with the old TV right now. I was watching family guy and the episode involved at dog licking out a baby's asshole, but it was on the last episode had that, uh, were Brian. The dog ate out steelies asshole and cleaned shit office as, how's that? And we're talking about masturbating, having a problem with masturbating. Wow. That's incredible. I have to see that episode, Dude. It's the best episode download last episode of family guy. They're trapped in a bank, a bank vault or something like that, and it is so fucking ridiculous. The shit that they get away with unregular primetime television and we're talking about fucking at rubber.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       Your, uh, as successful as they are or successful south park is, you basically can do whatever the fuck you want because people want to be on your show, you know, advertisers rather, right? They want to advertise on your show and your show is gigantic. South Park has just got such all loyal Legion of followers at this point in time until the Mohammed thing. They've pretty much got away with doing like almost anything they wanted for a long time.

Speaker 2:          00:22:01       That's crazy about the Mohammed that mean because in New York City they just captured that guy, that bomber and there's a connection that people are starting to make between a Republican senator or something like that said that they, uh, I think there might be a connection between the two, but they haven't proved anything yet.

Speaker 1:          00:22:16       Well, you know, I mean, that's a good thing to speculate automatically that be a connection. But you know who the fuck knows yoder was, man, what if listen man, people, people are that dumb. There are people that really do believe that you're not supposed to make fun of them at all and if you do, you're supposed to die like that. They are the. That's the worst example of human beings in the world. And the problem with the Middle East, and this is what I've always talked about, I've talked about it as a joke in my act, but it really is kind of true. One of the reasons why the there, there are so arcane in their ways. We don't try and adjust the sound. One of the reasons why there are so arcane in their ways is that that's where culture like began. The oldest known civilization that we know of is Sumir and that's where Iraq is.

Speaker 1:          00:23:00       So basically like the people that are still in that area or like the townies of the world. I mean, they're really stuck on some fucking multifamily hundred year old trip and us being in America, and it's not that America is better than other countries, but the one advantage that America has as it were the most recent country, so we're all from somewhere that sucked. Every one of us here is we came from somewhere that sucked or answer says came from somewhere that suck and they congregate it to this one place to get the most fresh idea supposedly to be the most progressive because they're at the furthest ahead of the curve, but people in like the Middle East, that's the furthest. That's the beginning point of the curve. Like do they really are the fucking townies of the world and that's why the problem with this fucking cartoon thing is that these motherfuckers really do believe that there's some magical motherfucker that you're not supposed to draw.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       I mean, it's, it's bananas. You know that that is the enemy of evolution. This ancient ideology, this multipurpose fucking ridiculous idea that somehow or another several thousand years ago, they had it wired. They hadn't figured out back then, even though they didn't know Jack Shit about medicine, about the constellations. They didn't know anything, but they had it wired. They. They knew. They knew what was going on. What the fuck are you talking about? It's ridiculous. The fact that there's people willing to die for that, that in 2010 that is still rocking. It is amazing. It's amazing. Yeah. Tom Cruise was the same way to do. Personally. I think that the scariest thing is not even the Middle East. I don't think the scariest thing in this world is that ideology. I think that's very scary, but to me what's scarier is what's happening in Mexico and the fact that Mexico is connected to us and Mexico is the middle of gigantic gang wars between the police and these gang cartels that have fucking billions of dollars.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       These guys have insane amounts of money because that's the only way you can make money. So it's basically like. I mean, that's not the only way you can make money in Mexico. So I what I'm saying, I'm saying, you know, they're totally illegal to sell cocaine. It has to be sold illegal. You can't sell it legally. You can't regulate it and tax it. You can't do anything with it. You have to sell it illegally. So people are going to buy cocaine, they're going to buy cocaine from Mexico and there's, someone's going to get that money. Who the fuck's going to get that money? Will these drug lords have all that money and now they're more powerful than the police and they've got US troops are going in there now and fucking helping out. I mean, it's bananas down there, Dude. There's fucking ward in the streets with tanks with bananas and people are still going there for vacations.

Speaker 1:          00:25:41       It's like the last spring break that was still one of the hotspots for people to go for spring break. If they were Muslims, we'd be fucked. Okay. The fact that they're Christians and then on into blown themselves up for, you know, for Jesus, they're, they're, they're into, you know, I mean what's going on is it's a lot of money and a lot of influence and a lot of people that get illegal money and they're dominating the actual political system over there and as many as they try to raid, there's so many more of them. It's such a fucking hard fight because they let them like, dig in and get infested. There's so many fucking gigantic cartels with just tons and tons of money and guns. It's so frightening. But if they like, if they were the enemy, if that was Muslim, I mean if like, if like Pakistan was right next door to us and this shit was going down, it would be even scarier.

Speaker 1:          00:26:30       You know? It really would because for some reason the Mexicans aren't blaming the Americans. It's really interesting. It's like Mexican people are pretty proud people and now they're not blaming a lot of family here and that's fine. They're not going to fuck with half of their families. It's also, I mean it's really clear what happened. They want to. Mexico wanted to make drugs illegal, they wanted to decriminalize it and make them legal and make it so that people can sell them and tax and mental and the United States said no fucking way, like no way and if you don't have laws and you know you were involved in a business like selling drugs, you're going to have criminals because even when you have laws, we have things like pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies are basically legal drug dealers and they're dealing shit that kills motherfuckers every day. There's always people dropping off from vicodin and percocet.

Speaker 1:          00:27:22       I remember when I got my nose fixed, when I got my deviated septum operated on, the good doctor gave me to a value. No, it was a, a vicodin and percocet. He gave me a prescription for both and I looked at him like, man, this stuff is bad for you. Like how bad is this going to fucking hurt? It's going to hurt way more than it hurts right now. Like I'd rather just deal with it being annoying. Then get hooked on some crazy fucking pharmaceutical pills that like an addict. You like what? Like 30 percent of the time. How many people get addicted to Vicodin? Like did they think of those things out like candy? Well, right after I decided not to accept the prescription. A study came out showing that the FDA food and Drug Administration so was there. They're going to recommend like cutting way back on prescriptions and they like recommend that doctors did not prescribe them because of liver damage and because of addiction I have probably for half full bottles of magnum laying around just from going to the dentist.

Speaker 1:          00:28:17       They talked to you sometimes. Do they talk to you that vitamin bottles? Only when I sleep, like in the middle of the night I wake up and you're combing my hair and go, Geez, you really stressed right now. You feel better. Actually I hate Mike. Shoe me up, man. I hate fighting. I hate feeling. I just feel gross when I do like it and I've only done vicodin once. When I had my first knee operation, I've had three knee operations, two acl reconstructions, one meniscus surgery, and uh, the first time I had the acl done it was pretty painful because they did what's called a Patella tendon graft, a scar that goes from here to here. And what they do is they take a chunk of bone out of your knee and a chunk of bone out of your Shin and they cut this big tendon. This is one of the, they cut a slice of it off with the bone and then they open you up like a fish and they drill it in place.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       So they take this tendon and they make it smaller to make you a fake tendon for the acl. And it's apparently it was supposedly like physically stronger than the original acl. But the point is you're, you got holes in your bones and screws and your bones and it hurts like a bitch when you get up, especially when you're sitting down and then you get up. It's way more pain. I have the other one done with a cadaver, so I got a dead dudes. Shit in this knee, but the one with the acl where they do the surgery with the ticket off the bone is way, way, way more painful. You get up from the couch and be like watching TV and it was just like hot lava, just hot lead. Just going right into my bones. It was so fucking painful and I took a vicodin. That was the only time I ever took one and I felt so stupid. Yeah, just so drugged and my jaw was slack and I was watching TV and I thought to myself while it was under it, I was like, I will never take this dumb shit again. This stuff's terrible. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:30:02       so we'd have some people are the exact opposite. They'll give you 20 bucks for awakening. Well,

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       W w what basically we're trying to say is there's no fucking difference between vicodins inheritance. Heroin and Oxycontin and heroin are really the same thing. There's no fucking difference between pharmaceutical companies and drug dealers. The only difference is that drug dealers don't have to. They don't have to work within the law. The pharmaceutical companies, they have to bribe politicians. They have to. They have to wax doctors, you know what to do with doctors. They take everybody out to dinner. Mrs Rogan is, her mom is a nurse and I'm the. She's a. She works with these pharmaceutical companies, these nurses, they don't make much money and they don't get to go out to fancy dinners where the pharmaceutical companies come along and say, hey, Viagara is going to take us out on a nice dinner and they all get to go to a nice restaurant and have a nice meal and it's all on these pharmaceutical companies. They pay for the drinks, they pay for everything and so these people are more likely to talk nice about their pharmaceuticals, so they prescribe them more.

Speaker 2:          00:30:59       You know what's fucked up about that is I've thought about that also when I go to the doc. The other is that the doctor review. It was a poor example because that's a good one. Right. I went to the doctor's the other day for acid reflux because sometimes after eat like too much caffeine, onions or a drink too much. I kind of have feel like an acid coming up from my throat. It makes my throat feel tight and all this other stuff. I had this for a long time. I've had it for a while, so finally went to the doctor, the ODA digestive doctor, and I told him everything I had and then he's like, oh, let me give you some samples. He gave me a garbage bag, almost full of the sample was called the blue pill.com. I don't remember what the name of it, but was the blue pill.com or something that.

Speaker 2:          00:31:35       And I'm thinking, you know what, I wonder if this is even the best thing I could be taking right now or if this guy just got paid to get me a bottle and because he gave me like 20 bottles of samples and coupons and books and it's like. And I, I take it and I'm like, yeah, I guess that kind of is better, but I don't know if I'm just tricking myself or if I have to go back there, make a second appointment, you know, just to be like, look, whatever you gave me, that's bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:32:00       We know for sure the doctors are influenced by pharmaceutical. You know, they give them money, they get money for. They were getting, I don't know if it's still true, it's still legal in or if there's different states have different laws. I don't know how it all works, but from what I understand, doctors have been busted where they're getting a percentage of the amount of sales that they have. Like say if they sell, you know, x amount of volumes, they get a kickback from the pharmaceutical company. That should absolutely be illegal. I mean that's

Speaker 2:          00:32:28       crazy. And that's what an analyst that's hopefully technology helps that done. So when they tried to prescribe something like a million topics come from text to your phone and you go, actually no, I want to take this one. This one's better, you know like yeah, an iphone apps.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       It tells you, your doctors trying to get you to turn it, you turned it on and when the doctor not trying to shit on doctors anything, then that's. The whole system is fucked up. And when you're a doctor and you're struggling to get along and you have to pay an insane amount of malpractice insurance, malpractice insurance for doctors has goddamn brutal. And then you have all these assholes that want to sue you for fucking nothing, for no reason for shit getting wrong, for you. Getting an affection for things that are totally unavoidable. And I'm not saying the doctors perfect, but you know, it's hard for doctors, their medical bills or fucking or medical school bills are gigantic. They're fucking huge. And then all of a sudden some pharmaceutical company comes along and says, Hey, you know, you're, you're still helping all these people. You're still doing great thing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       We just would love it if you would tell them, you know, Take Vioxx if you have arthritis. So these doctors say, yeah, I could do that and we'll, we'll, we'll be in on a deal with you guys. You can buy it, you know, we'll give you a share in the company will give you a certain percentage for every Vioxx bottle you sell. We'll give you x percent. And so they don't think they're doing anything wrong. Vioxx is something that was created to help people. This person has a pain, I'll give them this, it'll help their pain and I'll profit in it and they don't even think it's a bad thing. And then next thing you know that they're prescribing it way more than they did before, especially like nutty pills or you talk to like there's been many studies done on people who take on to have a presence and how, uh, people have gone to a psychiatrist just for experimentation purposes just to write stories on it and just said, hey, you know, I'm just having trouble sleeping.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       I feel shitty all day. I don't know what to do here. Take this. Bam. It's like that simple of Zoloft and you'll feel better, right? Like they're just dishing it out. Try this for a little bit and tell us how you feel like, Whoa, we're fucking with human neurochemistry and we're allowing these heartless pharmaceutical companies to do it. You can't do that, man. There's got to be more oversight. I know there's a lot of money in involved in pharmaceuticals and I know that there's a lot of pharmaceuticals that do a lot of good for a lot of people. Not saying there's anything bad about it, but there's got to be way more oversight because they have so much shit out there that you can get addicted to. There's so much that will fuck your life up and it's readily available. Oxycontin's fucking percosets. Volume's vicodins.

Speaker 1:          00:34:52       Those, those fucking things will crush you and somehow or another, those guys are doing something that's way more acceptable than some of themselves. Pot or coke or Fox or rubber or vagina or vagina looked at as heroes, doctors and staff, but yet if you talk about this book, doctors are heroes. Man, the doctors at a fixed me up, I'm in forever in their debt. The guy who fixed my nose, the guys who fixed my knees, you know, if it wasn't for them, I knows what suck and I wouldn't be able to walk that good. You know what I mean? Doctors are fucking awesome. I'm not saying that. I'm just saying we live in this ridiculous state of a poc resy because there's certain drugs that we make illegal. You aren't supposed to have them. It's not that you can get them prescribed if you need them or they can, you know, monitor, you know you're not allowed to.

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       Big Daddy who knows more than you, tells you that if you're with this drug, this drug, we're going to lock you in a cage like what the fuck? Why is that? Is that set up so that the people who really appreciate and recognize the merits and the psychedelic drugs rise up so that they realize they have to literally overthrow the, the culture, the way of thinking. They have to not overthrow rather, but overturn the way, the way the culture accepts drugs because that's the only thing that seems to make sense. All the beneficial ones are illegal. You don't ever hear about someone talking to you about they did value them and they. They just really had this life changing experience and learn to love everyone. No, you don't have that fucking on valium. I felt connected to the universe and I realized that I'm just a part of a never ending process in my biology is trying to hold onto everything and that's where the insecurity comes from.

Speaker 1:          00:36:33       You know? No, you don't get that from fucking value. Okay. You get that from mushrooms and mushrooms grow outside and if they catch you with them, they put you in a cage. If they come by your fucking house and you have mushrooms growing on your car under your tree, in your backyard, they are legally allowed to lock you in a box. They can take you and arrest you. That's fucking bananas. Bananas and that are enforcing our ridiculous thinking on the Mexican people is why those drug cartels got into power. Is that a conspiracy theory perhaps? Is that a little bit of Tinfoil hat perhaps? Yeah, maybe, but you know, some of that tin foil hat shit is on the money and I, I think it is with this, we're live right next to a country that's involved in a way more deadly war than the one going on in Afghanistan or going on in Iraq.

Speaker 1:          00:37:22       Both of them combined. Can't even touch the body counts that are happening in Mexico right next door. They're killing motherfuckers. They're going crazy over there, dude, and you can get there by walking. You know what I'm saying? I mean, we're all invested in Afghanistan and securing Afghanistan. Meanwhile, we live right next to a fucking third world country. We are connected to them with an invisible line and they're involved in the bloodiest pharmaceutical war that's ever been fought in the history of this earth, the illegal pharmaceutical war. They're finding it with God damn tanks. They're fighting a pharmaceutical war with tanks and that's what the war is the worst. Who gets to sell your shit? Is it going to be people that have no law whatsoever or is it going to be people that have laws and if you say it's going to be people that have laws and that the other stuff, you're not going to allow, well then someone's gonna sell that other stuff cause he's a goddamn demand for it.

Speaker 2:          00:38:17       It sits dangerous everywhere that. Did you hear about this? A West Hollywood like yesterday or something like that. A woman walks into target at West Hollywood. I just started fucking stabbing or shooting people, I think shooting people, shop for people and finally was taken down by you. Got to do a google. This is the age of the Internet side. You can't be used in like 1984 type storytelling skills. We'll give you a why look us up, give some facts about target. Target is an awesome place if you want to buy some shit and they usually have it there. However, target will not carry the rubber pussy. No target frowns upon the rubber pussy. They're not stabs for people in a so it is stabbing in West Hollywood. Uh, she's 34 years old. Enter the store. Attack shoppers with a butcher knife, a steak knife and off duty. La County Sheriff, deputy and store security guards apprehended her.

Speaker 1:          00:39:11       Thank God those guys were there. Thank God someone so fucking balls. I hope they brain that bitch. When they took her out, they should have just shoved that fucking knife right into our heart. You know, you're in the middle of a battle, a knife battle with a knife wielding assailant. You should just stick that fucking thing right in neck. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:39:27       She was yelling, I'm bipolar. There's no witness protection program.

Speaker 1:          00:39:31       Oh God. See? At that point we have to know when to kill people. We really do. You can't bring that person back and reintroduce them to society. This life is short and you have fucked it up so bad. There's just no way of coming back from that. We just got to start from scratch and it sends a message to all the other people out there thinking about going nutty. Don't go that nutty. All right. Stop. They'll go running into target and fucking stabbing people. We're not going to allow that shit. Jesus Christ, you know, we're so goddamn tolerant of fucking loonies to kill him.

Speaker 2:          00:40:05       Yeah. Have you seen those back? I think I talked about this, talked about it the other day when we were talking to the fleshlight dude does it the new, the new, uh, piercings where they have a up and down your back. They have hoops and then they take laces and go back and forth, like it's a dress and I tie bows and stuff with it. I was thinking, you know how fucking crazy is that? Even piercings are crazy. I remember back in the day it was left hoop, right hoop, you know, that was the whigs and one eyebrow eyebrow eyebrow. And it moved on the belly button and then like some crazy girls got nipples and clits. Now they're fucking making clothes out of your skin. I think you should probably talk to that microphone more. Put the pumped up. Pick it up. Yeah, but it's getting to the point where now it's like like laces back and forth and like you're. You're making skin dresses. That's how crazy piercing is.

Speaker 1:          00:40:55       Yeah. What he's talking about as a series of loops that these women are putting on their bodies and their back and they make it like shoelaces. Yeah. Fucking. It's the trippiest thing ever. When you see someone that's a girl doesn't give a fuck, right? Yeah. There was a blank. If you fuck her in the ass, she'll be like, what?

Speaker 2:          00:41:12       There was a girl standing outside of my grocery store trying to do Greenpeace, whatever that shit is because she had that whole thing up and down with a bra on. Do you

Speaker 1:          00:41:20       think that that's the message that the message is that they're just. They can take all sorts of crazy pain. That's the sexiness of the message that our people are just getting weird about skin. Yeah, but does that maybe the sexiness of the. What it is, is that you know, what you're doing is you're taking a lust to the next level because everything has got to go to the next level now because we have this crazy access to information, you know, like people are fucking way different than they fucked. Like in the 19 seventies, you know, no one is accepting, you know, lights out, you know, just fucking and no, no dirty talk. No nothing. Missionary Style Rollover Kiska and I go to sleep. No one is accepting that everyone's going [inaudible] style and this is all because of the Internet because pornography has changed the way people look at sex and you know what they're talking about.

Speaker 1:          00:42:05       A lot of people are talking about there's a problem with young girls right now getting all sorts of problems with their bubbles because they're having but sex like, hey, early and all the time. Yeah, there's going to be a lot of 30 year old women in a couple years from now with that. Yeah. The diapers on and that's gonna be the fashion I fastened with your pamper. Oh my God. No, you know it's going to be. The big operation is not going to be botox. It's going to be getting your butthole tightening, get your butthole brought back to reality and like a filter for awhile. You're going to have to use a colostomy bag for a little while until your butthole gets recovered from the surgery. That's Shit's real, man. That's. That's one of these people doing. They're their. You know what they're doing. They're there. They're getting there.

Speaker 1:          00:42:42       They're getting everything to the highest level possible. That's what these piercings are about. That's what guys think. Girls who were tattooed up or sexy, what's sexy about tattoos? If you have tattoos, you know how much fucking pain it causes. It's so God damn painful, so you see someone with tattoos, you're like, that's someone who doesn't give a fuck, you know, and that's the sexiness of it, but shit, we're word bananas, man. Our society is going in a very, very, very, very strange direction. Oh, that's ridiculous. It's the, the age of information is not necessarily aiding it entirely because people aren't necessarily using the information on the Internet to make an objective opinion. They're usually trying to find stuff that reinforces their own current opinion. It's a very tempting thing. You know, you've got to look at like, like w with ideas in the Internet. You got to look at both sides of it, but a lot of people aren't.

Speaker 1:          00:43:31       So it's like almost helping retards be retarded if they can find other sites that say the earth is flat and dinosaurs lived with people 6,000 years ago, as long as you can. You can find plenty of sites. If you look around and tells you that evolution is retarded, you could have plenty of science that we'll have guys who are doctors and they're scientists and they are telling me they're obviously crazy, but they're telling people that the earth is only 6,000 years old and carbon dating is not real and that evolution is a myth and that, you know, we had to come from somewhere so there has to be a god and that, you know, the Bible is, you know, can prove the Bible mathematically and they start talking talk and these are doctors and scientists. So if you just look for them, you'll, you'll decide on their point of view, you know, I mean if you just look at any one side of any issue you can, you can get your answers reinforced.

Speaker 1:          00:44:20       So the problem with that is people are just getting their answers reinforced or questions rather reinforced there. They're not necessarily like learning, you know, they're finding other retards, your setup websites that confirmed they're retarded ideas and all that. That's kind of a little bit of a problem. That's one problem with the Internet. You know, the other part of it is just magnificent. The other part of it is people who are open minded who are really using it, it's this crazy network of information and they're really learning like at this incredible exponentially expanding rate. Like we're learning shit and we're so much more aware of shit than our parents were. Were so much more aware of information. There's so much more shit going on that you have to store in your head. I mean it's the one I talked to my mom about like the world, like what's going on in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:45:05       It's, I feel like I'm talking to my daughter. I mean it's like it's, you know, there's, there's a level of understanding that our civilization or are. I'm a generation has reached that really hasn't been reached before. Is that just an age thing? No, no. It's the, it's the Internet man. The Internet. Yeah. I mean it's acceleration. I mean, I think our parents were smarter than their parents and their parents were smarter than their parents and you know, it's always been that way that we evolve and as we evolve, we get brighter. And you can see that in culture, you can see that in like the movies that use, they used to watch the 19 forties, they're fucking horrible. I mean, they're way worse than the right.

Speaker 6:          00:45:38       It doesn't even have to be the 1940 the other day. I watched a reality bites. I don't know if you remember that movie had a, uh, what's his name? Ben Stiller. Janeane Garofalo had all these famous people are awesome. Sounds. What was the other one that you.

Speaker 1:          00:45:48       You're telling me that you made your girl watch you. You thought it was an awesome movie at the time, but it was fucking terrible and she was mad at you.

Speaker 6:          00:45:55       What was that? Oh, can't buy me love. But Reality Bites don't you? The dream big dream is in it. And he used to mow lawns and he paid the money bag. All those bras delivering pizzas. And that's the same one. No one paid the most popular girl to be his girlfriend for a week. And then he became too popular and then she's still cranberry juice on a dress today. But I watched that the other day. It was awful. But reality bites, horrible, like really uncomfortable to watch and then. But the worst disturbing thing is I used to have a crush on Janeane Garofalo back in that time period. I thought she was like, oh, she's a hot comic girl. She's so high. I looked at that movie, almost puked because how ugly she was. Now I want to know what the fuck.

Speaker 6:          00:46:42       Don't be rude. That's rude. You're being rude in a movie character and the character in that movie with Abby, you used to have different tastes. Now you're into like the porn star. Look, that's all cool. That's all cool. You know? But back then that's what it is. Everybody has a look and he watched the movie. You could see the line where we're making it up. That's ridiculous. Listen, that's not what's important. What's important is the evolution of culture. What's important in this conversation is not your fucking weird thing. Which my. I'm just saying I evolved. That movie to me is like I watched altered states. It was terrible, right? Ultra stays totally. Just not home. Hold

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       up. I mean, to me, that movie changed my life because that's the movie that got me into the isolation tanks. If it wasn't for altered states, I probably never would have a tank in my basement and when that tank in my basement has changed the way I look at the world, that thing is like my reset button. Whenever I got anything that's fucking with my hand, that tank kicks me the real deal. Every time. It's like my guidebook. It's like literally to me, my isolation tank. He's like my connection to the spirit world. It's like my spirit guide. It sounds completely retarded and gay and it sounds new agey, but that's what it feels like when I get in there and I just zone. I just disappear. My body disappears when my mind has no sensory input. What? I'm just floating through space in that tank.

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       I get truth. I get straight truth about everything I've ever done about anything that I've ever done where I was the Douche bag. Anything that I've ever watched where you know, I, I can rewatch like things that have happened in my life and see where I've personally made mistakes, things that I've done well, things that I could have avoided, reasons why people are upset at me, like everything you kicks you and then it kicks me everything about what am I doing wrong in my personal life? What am I doing wrong in my career? What am I doing wrong in my comedy? What am I doing wrong in my writing? Here's what you could eliminate. Here's what you can do better. Almost never like it's never appraising thing. It's always like a ruthless self-examination experience. It's never like a experience like, yeah, I'm fucking awesome here.

Speaker 1:          00:48:40       I'm in the water. Never. It's almost always uncomfortable, but after you get out of it, man, you have a new found appreciation and respect for life, you know, and that, that experience would not have happened if I didn't watch that movie. Altered states and get, get confused. Meanwhile watched it. I couldn't even watch the whole movie. I shut it off. It was a piece of shit. Those old movies just don't hold up like etc. I watched that the other day and you remember when it was like, I could believe this is an alien I saw the other day and he's like, ha,

Speaker 7:          00:49:07       I can stop any rocks when he stops on my rocking. It's so bad.

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       It's amazing. Amazing. The technology available today, a random dude with a pc who knows how to encode three d animation. he could make something its own computer and literally have a texture to it and everything. It will be way better than 18. Imagine what you could do that with avatar graphics. Oh my god. It's going to happen. Why does that? Would that be 15 years, 15 years, years, 15 years? Shit is happening so quickly, man. Well, with the internet, with the level of complexity that they can pull off and animation now is just astounding. I mean, avatar still looked a little off, but the reason why they got away with it looking a little off is that they used monsters and shit that you don't know in real life. so you know, you're looking at it and you go, oh, it's fake. You can't tell it's fake.

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       But like you've watched like I am legend, I am. Legend is the shit. But when they had those lions, you like, get the fuck out of here. Those lines look so bad here. They're making a sequel to that have so good. I love that. I love that movie. That movie was fun. And uh, the um, in the, in the scene where he shoots the lion or he shoot, he's going to shoot a deer and align it takes out the deer. It looks so bad. It looks so corny and fake. It's so. It should be totally unacceptable. Like they really should have to film in another way, but you should have to do it in the where I can't see it when it happened so quickly. But what you show me is just dog shit for a movie that's that powerful. They can't totally recreate real life. And because of that, they can't totally recreate people yet, but they can really recreate monster shit that they make up. They can make shit that they invent. Look fucking amazing. Like king kong, king kong. That was awesome. I just saw that the other day also and that was still looks good, dude. I don't even watch that movie. You know what I do with that movie? I turned it on to the scene where king kong's fucking shit up. He jack off. I almost do. I scratch my chest.

Speaker 5:          00:51:02       Fucking crazy footage. If you watching king kong by start flooding.

Speaker 1:          00:51:10       I've always been obsessed with primates. I have a giant poster. King kong, it's like 12 feet tall. My flasHlights around like fucking apes. I have just a smidgen more monkey in me than the average person. I feel. I feel very connected to the monkeys. I get angry when I go to the zoo and I see the monkeys in the cage. I always want to let him out. It's always been like that little kid being curious. George fan, sIcilian man. Those monkeys. they're way closer to monkeys and regular people. There's. There's something about my. My ancestors, the way they used to yell at each other. It's just like going to the fucking chimps. My grandmother used to fucking scream at my grandfather. She didn't give a fuck that I was there. She didn't give a fuck that I was three or four or whatever the fuck I was. I'd be standing right next to her. She and my grandfather. My grandmother was always late for everything. My grandmother was crazy. She, my grandmother did time. Okay. So crazy. My grandma, my grandmother worked for the mom and she didn't come. That's crazy. And my grandmother's bananas, but she would fucking screen.

Speaker 1:          00:52:14       My grandfather's name was joe. Her name was jo. She would fucking scream at him and he would have to eat it. You're like a monkey.

Speaker 5:          00:52:20       I wasn't in the family. My family was in the line

Speaker 1:          00:52:24       cage at the zoo. What's up guys?

Speaker 5:          00:52:29       Yeah, you seem like a lion. I had to

Speaker 1:          00:52:32       describe you. You know what? What can brian was an animal? What would it be? Be? What are you? What's your son? Leah? Yardley. That's right. Don't have a monkey sign. If they had a monkey sound, I'm sure I'd be here a tiger. Do you get upset when you go to the zoo? Does that bother you? It doesn't surprise me fucking crap. More lIke, wow, tiger. I don't advise me. I'm just not that deep. I don't care about the dumb animals. Like I don't freak out when I see a walrus. Fuck a wall ball. We're kIss my ass. Give a fuck about you. You're just dumb. You know? What are you doing? I don't want to kill you. I don't want to hurt you. I don't want to cause you pain for no reason, but I don't give a fuck about you. When's your movies? Zookeeper coming out.

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       It's not my movie. Your movie's Kevin James movie, bro. And it comes out in october, october. Have you seen a preview? I've seen little clips where I had to do a voiceover shit. It's going to be fun. Yeah, it's a funny movie. Kevin's hilarious. He's a very funny guy. He's awesome at that. That whole physical comedy thing and doing it with all these animated animals and the animated animals. Pretty fucking dope. Yeah. They just, they just changed their mouths and make their mouths move. They're like real animals. They have to train real animals, do certain things, and then they like add animation to it, you know, and then they have like one guy in a monkey suit that one guy that's really funny, walked into a car, accidentally knocked himself out. It was really fucked up, you know, because he, he hit the thing hard. He rented the door, this car and just fell over our cold.

Speaker 1:          00:53:55       Wow. You didn't see a comment and he walked right into a door. This duck man, man, stop man. A fucking savages. These guys are nuts, man. The dude that I met on fear factor and the dudes that I've worked with, especially the guys on this, a zookeeper movie, [inaudible], there was a lot of crazy stunts. I, I crashed a bike. I wasn't supposed to be doing my own stunts, but I had this bike scene with me and kevin were. I'm chAsing them and I'm yelling at him, trying to reach them. I crashed my bike three or four hard times. Hard times. One way I go over the handlebars. Are you dating to the concrete dude? I went over the bars. I grabbed the front brake accidentally in squeeze it too hard and I just went over the top. That was only one hand in it because I was trying to grab him.

Speaker 1:          00:54:33       JusT improvising a scene. Dude. I launched myself, but somehow or another I was fine. Like somehow or another I this, the, the, the whatever, the, the clear headedness or the, you know, the peace of mind to gather myself. No, I knew I was going over this and just land correctly enrolled or something, something. I got lucky all the time. The only thing I did, I got a scratch on my shin, but dude, that crashed hard like four times. I did the crash recently that it could have easily broken a wrist or something. There's was one time when I went down where it was pretty fucking hard. I went over the handlebars and I got ahold of. I hit the ground first with my hands and then my face, my chin hit the ground, but I absorbed it and I pulled back enough. It was like just enough level headedness where I did. I wound up not because of jujitsu, I'm always fallen. You're always rolling with shit. You get comfortable with that. Like here's the round. It's like it's normal. It's a normal feeling, but dude, I kind of got fucked up. I could have lost some teeth

Speaker 6:          00:55:24       for sure. Yeah, I, I just got a bike recently and I did the same thing. I went over my handlebars because I hit a curb. It was dark out and I hit a curb and it didn't like pop over. It just went straight down for a second and I flipped over my bike and I felt like my teeth. I'm like, oh my god, that's the first thing I do is grab my teeth, but I landed okay. But I was like, I could have died right there.

Speaker 1:          00:55:43       Yeah, man, that's some scary shit. Bicycles are fucking scary when you're fallen, man. I just read some article about some woman who just got paralyzed from a horse racing horse jumping same as christopher reeve did, jumping over hurdles and shit like that. That's some scary shit, dude. You don't need to be doing that. People in, you know, taking it from a guy who was involved in the ufc does jujitsu. It sounds ridiculous. But jujitsu, if you, if you trust your partners, you pretty safe that. I mean I'm doing it all the time and I've only been injured a few times and one of the injuries was an old injury. You know, I had one acl and meniscus tear from my old taekwondo days and that one re-injured first in jujitsu and then I, I

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       injured the other leg, but that's over fucking. I've been doing it now for 14 years. That's a long ass time. You not only have a few minor injuries and to roll like all the time because most of the time you're rolling with dudes you can trust and you know you're not going to fucking dump each other on each other's heads. You're not gonna. You're not going to hurt each other if you don't have to. Like when you get an armbar stop me back off before you know, you know, you know when a dude is got you know, you don't hurt each other so that you could trust people.

Speaker 8:          00:56:50       Well, you can't trust a fucking Horse. You can't trust a horse. If the horse is decides, fuck this. It just digs those legs in. You're done sign. You're going to go flying. You're. You're on a giant, super powerful animal and animal that's so strong. It can run like what? Fifty miles an hour with a person on its back. Are you fucking kidding me? You're going to go off like a pillow. You're just going to go flying off. You're not even going to believe how light you feel. That horse just stops and just throws his muscular fucking shoulders up into it. You just launched like you're on a spring head first, right into the dirt. Snap your neck. How cool would it be?

Speaker 6:          00:57:30       none of us had cars because gas went out and we all had to get horses. We all had our own horse and then like every time we went, hung out. We all had her horses together to be friends with their horse. Breaks his leg. You to shoot him in the head. I know. Think that's terrible. Yeah, but then we'll get into horse or two of her friends. Horses would mate and have a baby horse. It'd be cool just to have your own horse. Brian, where's into? She definitely had one extra hit I think should not have had that third hit. I think it's cool that I live in an equestrian district where it'd be nice if you're with the horse and you treated it very well from the time it was young, so you had an awesome relationship with the horse. Right. But that's not always going to be the case and it's going to be like you go to a dog park with your dog. There's always gonna be some douche bag with his fucking dog that wants a bite. Everybody's dog, you know. And that's gonna be what it's going to be like with horses. My other two can't trust people to raise the horses correctly. So you're gonna have a bunch of horses out there that are douchebag horses. They're going to get mad at your horses. You're gonna have douchebag. Gang wars.

Speaker 8:          00:58:25       Awesome. This is the most ridiculous conversation to have a horse. What else, brian? Well, I was shooting for real money. Wouldn't you get. I'd get a pony when, if I can't get a pegasus,

Speaker 6:          00:58:42       what if we run out of oil or if we run out of golf? Can we all go back to that? That'd be crazy. If you had to go back to the board. It's really ridiculous how short a period of time. I put this on my twitter this week. Go just thinking about it. How nutty it is that 200 years ago, the fastest way to get around was on the back of an animal. Right? Two hundred years ago. That's so funny to think about it. And there was no photographs in the best way to get an image of someone was to draw them 200 years ago. No,

Speaker 3:          00:59:07       that's nothing. That's um, a blink in time. Jesus christ. And it's all because of technology and an oil. Unfortunately. It's all because of oil. All the plastic, all the shit we use. I mean, how is oil

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       like embedded in our life? It's totally, it's the main thing for almost all the words for religion and oil together. Yeah. Well

Speaker 3:          00:59:29       I believe that religion and oil are stuffed in together, you know, on purpose. Just to make it easier to control the oil, you know, whether or not that's true, you know, I mean the, you know, the idea that the cia is involved and all these, you know, secret shadow government organizations are involved in creating drama and turmoil so that we always have an enemy over there and that's a very real theory. And, and you know, if you talk to people who understand, you know, how the United States is involved in other countries and how we do sell arms to people like Iran and Iraq and we do provide them with weapons and we played both sides of the fence will provide their enemy was shit too. And we create, we create drama, you know, this weekend go in there and cleaned it up.

Speaker 1:          01:00:08       We should find a way to make money off of religion oil combining the two like jesus oil

Speaker 3:          01:00:16       in the oil business or all the people that are supporting the conservative. Right? But at this point, I think the concern that I think everybody's involved, you know, I don't think it's just the conservatives. I don't think it's just the republicans. The democrats are just as like, I mean, I believe obama was in favor of offshore drilling, you know, I think there was so much pressure that we need to relieve ourselves of the, uh, the need for foreign oil that they, uh, that they were in support of it. I think everybody was of it. Look, it seemed like a great idea. I was, I mean, I thought it was a good idea. I'm like, if they don't spill that shit and it doesn't seem like they do very often. I was like, well, hey, if they know what they're doing, that's the problem. If they know what they're doing. So I was in favor of it too until I saw this and I was like, okay, this is crazy. I got it. No, that this could happen. I thought that if something breaks you just shut it off. You know, I thought like you have some sort of a fail safe. Like I can't believe they had no backup plan. Like there's, they don't know the exact estimate, but one of the estimates is 40,000. You're talking about 40,000 gallons a day.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       That's insane. Yeah. think of how many, how much oil that is. Well, I think have a big. The ocean is, so I've heard hundreds of thousands. I've heard a million gallons a day. I've heard all these different efforts for hundred thousand, but even if it's a thousand gallons of oil a day even that. Have you seen the slIck, the slickest gigantic, pretty fun green. You can see it with a satellite. I hate seeing the animals that they're like cleaning off their phones is and stuff like that. Well, the one of the ways that people describe me and they're saying that it could be apocalyptic, like that was the language that they use. I'll talk elliptic apocalyptic. It just sells more tee shirts. Joe, is that what it is? Yeah. I don't know dude. It's, it seems pretty. Look at. Look at, um, we're looking at images right now and you can't see because you're not here, but the streak is jai fucking qinetiq. Okay. Forty 2000 gallons of oil per day. That's what these people are saying. I mean, who knows if they're right. nobody's down there with the fucking a measuring spoon. MeasurIng, measuring spoon. We've been

Speaker 3:          01:02:04       talking about nobody's down there measuring for real, but it is an insane amount of oil and it's leaking out every day and they don't know exactly how they're going to stop it and I heard someone last night, but this is a dude in jujitsu class, so who knows if he was telling me the truth, it could have been just talking out of his ass, but he was saying that they could stop the oil, but the way they would have to stop it is blow up the. Well they would have to blow it up and if they did that the oil was stopped but then they'd be fucked because they don't want to do that because they have this well down there. They want to protect and they want to be able to turn it back on again eventually.

Speaker 3:          01:02:39       If that's true, that's insane. If there really is a fix and I have to do is blow it up and they're worried becAuse this, this company wants to, you know, continue to pump oil out of there like you. Number one is you've got to stop what you're doing. You gotta stop oil coming out, you know, did you build the build the. Well, you built it right? You built it. He going to have to build a new one. Okay. You can't salvage the parts of this while it's bleeding oil into the ocean. I mean that's bananas. Like if there really is a fix and the fix involves them destroying the whole thing, you got to destroy the whole thing first and then rebuild it. I don't care how many years it takes to make one of those things. It doesn't. That doesn't mean think how many years is going to take to clean up? What the fuck he did?

Speaker 5:          01:03:16       can't you just get a ship of cat litter and put it on it? Isn't that what you do in the garage? Cat litter, just clung to it. It all. YOu've used poor bags of it would make these big gelatinous cat litter and oil glob boulders that'd be sitting on the bottom of the ocean floor and they would just scoop them up. I'm up. I'm up like one of those cat more sense than what they're doinG now. Well, they're not doing anything now. They, they've, they've trIed to stop it,

Speaker 3:          01:03:47       they've cut it back a little bit apparently supposedly from the most recent reports, but as far as getting it stopped or even under control, if you're not even close, they could be a week away from doing something, you know, they're talking about putting some kind of giant dome over it. I mean, the whole thing is.

Speaker 5:          01:04:02       See, that's ridiculous. Yeah. Superman movie. If it Works in the garage or [inaudible] o'shea, it's fucking bananas. The whole thing has bananas. It's literally going to kill everything in that area. I mean there's the those slick. I mean I'm looking at the images when they show them to you online and it doesn't seem real. That doesn't seem crazy. Does. It literally doesn't seem real. Look at this. There's images. If you go to earth observatory.nasa.gov, you know, you could just throw that picture and you ustream producer and show everybody right now if I can. Yeah, I don't do that. Save it on your desktop and then just throw it in there. God damn brian, you're so smart. Blank image

Speaker 9:          01:04:39       slick. Put that on my desktop

Speaker 5:          01:04:48       and now I'm going to ustream producer and I just dragged it in. This is not interesting at all or listening online. How do I do this? I think you add pictures. Here Was this picture, but they're open image image file. That's open video file.

Speaker 9:          01:05:04       I think you clicked on open image file.

Speaker 5:          01:05:11       Let's go down to your desktop

Speaker 9:          01:05:14       slick. So

Speaker 3:          01:05:21       let's say this works. What we did is we just start. Yeah, there we go. We just started using this thing called a ustream producer and the reason why. So now you can see these ustream video podcasts on your iphone and your ipad. You fucking junkies, you visual junkies. but look at that god damn slick. If you're looking at this on ustream, if you're not an you're on itunes, check this out. When you get home, go, uh, go google it. Go to the nasa site and you see the size of this fucking oil slick on, on a satellite image. And it's bananas. It's really hard to grasp. It's so big and it's just nonstop and they don't even have it under control and it's just pumping oil. And I don't know how the fuck they're going to. I don't know how they're going to fix that shit.

Speaker 5:          01:06:05       Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I don't think they know either, man. Don't think they know my ad. Live shot and this action.

Speaker 3:          01:06:13       See now in the future you can just keep. That's pretty dope man. Powerful producer software. Powerful. Nice. So, uh, you know, until we get off fossil fuels, we're never going to be able to avoid catastrophes that happen when, when oil spills, there was another one that just happened

Speaker 5:          01:06:29       and where a m and a

Speaker 3:          01:06:33       laca straight an oil tanker exploded. And this was yesterday

Speaker 5:          01:06:39       in

Speaker 3:          01:06:40       peck and baroo.

Speaker 5:          01:06:42       I don't know where that is.

Speaker 3:          01:06:44       A crude oil tanker was reported to have exploded. Like they fucking explode. That shit's flammable,

Speaker 5:          01:06:48       you know? I mean,

Speaker 3:          01:06:51       you can't get away from that. We have to, you know, as a, as a, as a species, we have to get past that. They have to figure out these super duper smart dudes have to figure out some new way. no, but right now it's so hard to do that because their system is so oil based. And it works so well, you know, I mean, think about how much we travel. Think about everything you do basically is involved in going somewhere and burning fuel. You know, I'm never, I'm, I'm, I'm home for a few days. You know, I'm home. I'm here. I mean, I don't sometimes I never leave my house at all for like a few days, but there's still like, I'm fucking using electricity. I mean, you know, you're, you're, you're, you're constantly using things that are made of plastic. You constantly consuming, um, things that people are produced from oil and I don't see that changing.

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       How the fuck is that going to change? You know, we would have to come up with a new way to reStructure the whole science. So there would have to be some sort of a reason to do that, to get away from the oil. They would have to be some drastic reason. It would have to be like a cataclysm. It would literally have to be something that resets society and causes us to start from scratch because unless we run out and we're not going to like, we're not gonna like pay attention until we run out. It's going to be like, oh shit, we're out. Fuck. Now we do. You know, like literally they're not gonna. They're not like protecting us and giving us a nice safety net so society can progress easily from here. Until then. It's not him. Same thing.

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       Hot man. Maybe it would. Maybe it would help, you know, but that's not going to fix everything. It's not going to fix everything. It's, it's, it's definitely we've got to do something. This, this oil thing does not work. It's, I mean there's a lot of weird arguments about what oil actually is and some people believe that oil is some sort of a natural substance created by the earth. There's a whole book I got on it called black gold stranglehold. I haven't bothered to research online to find out if it's been totally disproven or whether it's bullshit, but this guy's argument is that the oil isn't fossil fuels. It's not like really like plankton are dead plants or shit like that, like when people assume that it is millions of years of that, but with a finite amount left in the earth, but actually it's some sort of a natural fluid that's produced by the earth and if that's the truth, if he's right and he's probably not right, but if he is right, that's like the blood of the world.

Speaker 3:          01:09:11       Like we're like little vampire bugs sucking off the blood of the world. That's too trippy, man. Even if it, if fossil fuels, I mean even if it's not that, you know, even if it is the, the decay of, you know, things that have existed on this earth and we're consumed by death and decatur and created this, this substance that we use now. Even if that's the case, then it's like the shit of the earth. Then it's like we're sucking the shit of the earth out. Well either way, it's like we're sucking something out that's a part of some sort of a natural cycle. You know? It's all supposed to be in there. It's like, it's like literally like, we're like fucking mosquitoes, man. We really are in the earth is us. Yeah, the earth is us and we're, we're, we're ticks sucking off the blood and the most progress that we've ever had in the history of our race was when we started sucking off the blood of the earth.

Speaker 3:          01:10:04       When we started cannibalizing mother guy, when we started eating our mother, that's when everything started going awesome. So they created cars and computers and cell phones and you knoW, google voice in your pocket. All that shit is all because that we have this oil because we have figured out a way to to make sure that the oil and that we can transport shit with oil. You could get planes to fly using oil and we can. I mean it's fucking bananas. It's what a crazy society. One thing comes along, combustion engines figuring out how to use oil for plastic, for fuel, for all these different things and everythIng just goes buck nana's.

Speaker 3:          01:10:45       And then the question is, what's next? Have you heard about the smart dust shit? Yeah, dude, let me gliffy be our friend cliff. He be over at epic games, sent me this. You're gonna, you're gonna. Have to google this. You got to google up smart dust. This is the most bizarre thing that I think I have ever heard in my fucking life. These are, listen to this, these. These are wireless devices that are the size of grains of sand inside these wireless devices. The of grains of sand, they have the ability to transmit wirelessly. They have a power source. They have the ability to receive and send data. They have the ability to take images. It's the size of a fucking green sand. What websites? Cnn. This is on cnn, how it is fucking bananas and they're. They're literally talking about this being this smart dust being a real world web and the idea is that wireless sensors, they, that you can use these wireless sensors to monitor everything all over the world all the time. Like literally there will be no privacy.

Speaker 6:          01:11:50       So don't you think the smart desk probably would already have existed? you know, if, if this was true stuff, it's probably already probably in our room right now. I mean, do you think they're already been used? Maybe it was telling us about it because what did they do? Use it first and then

Speaker 3:          01:12:04       is pretty easy to track. I think it's pretty easy to track up to a certain point like what people are capable of. But this. I mean I don't, I don't know if the guys who make the most money of the top scientists who they are incorporated by. I'm not familiar with the scientific world, so I don't know if they. They get record recruited by big corporations or if they get recruited by the government and who gets all the best scientists. You know, who gets all the crazy genius do money, money does right oil and. well this thing is, this is a really bananas fucking project. It's really hard to explain how crazy this is. There's a company called street line that's installed 12,000 sensors on parking spots and highways in san francisco and the sensors, what they know is whether or not there's a car in that spot and what they're going to do is they're going to figure out a way to give you data.

Speaker 3:          01:12:48       So say if you're going, you know, 16th street and fair banks, you know, I need a parking spot. Is there any available? Yes, there's one right here. Go get it. And they will tell you whether or not there's traffic headed to that parking spot. Traffic's clear. No cars nearby. Like you can fucking go. They'll tell you where the traffic is, like the sensors on the street will be able to pick up traffic and they'll know what speed it's moving at. There's, there's gonna be no more speeding son. They're going to be able to know who you are and how fast you're going all the time. Like that's real. That's going to suck. That's okay.

Speaker 6:          01:13:20       So there's not going to be any sports cars and sports cars. You have to have to turn in your shit and get some slow ass. Only have horses, you and the horses because horses, you can't. It's not ethical. Yeah, you can't. Who cares about speeding on horses? Well, the sensor is going to be in the streets, so they'll be able to tell you that your horse is going to factor. It wasn't a speed limits when people had horses, right? I don't think so. It was actually better to go as fast as you could. You had the best. You probably have the best world. So we're going to go back. If you fell as fast you could, you know, maybe we should take it easy and just play it safe. That's why you have leather shit on. Let's just not gonna help you in your land, in your fucking hand on a cobblestone street because the horse, he saw a rat sensors to protect as a horse freaks out sandman

Speaker 3:          01:13:57       man. He's a fucking rat kuvan. And you go flying and smash your head on the curb. That's it. Horses, horses. Fuck oil. Well, this, this real world web that they are trying to create is one of the strangest inventions that I think I've ever heard about. Um, I, I did not know that they were this far along. I mean, these smart dust sensors can be relatively small and portable, portable. What they're talking about with this is that they're gonna. They're gonna have trillions of these things all over the world. I mean, this is the idea behind it. Is this even possible though, or is this just theories? Hewlett packard's involved and they're calling it. They're calling it the central nervous system for the earth and the coming years. The company plans to deploy a trillion sensors all over the planet. What? How bananas is first of all, how bananas is it that someone's letting them do that? If you're going to do what

Speaker 2:          01:14:51       I can't, we vote on this before you put jesus christ. You know there will be no privacy. There will be no privacy. It will be impossible. Someone will be able to detect this. Can't happen because then if it's like this, then we can put sensors in the white house.

Speaker 1:          01:15:07       yes it can. Yes, it can. Dude, I've been saying for a long time that I believe that the next stage of human beings is going to be the no secret stage that's going to. There's going to be some. I mean, it's going to be eventually it's gonna get to the point where we can see each other's thoughts and we can communicate with each other and read each other's minds and memories and ideas and we get each other's ideas directly from each other. That's the next stage, but it's not going to go directly to that. It's gonna. Take a little pit stop along the way and the pitstop it's going to take along the way is no more privacy. that's step number one. Before the interface, before human beings are allowed to interface with each other, where before we were allowed to become one gigantic, gigantic wireless mind and that's possible

Speaker 3:          01:15:47       and park probably.

Speaker 1:          01:15:49       I think that's the future. I think there's gonna be some sort of a neural connection that allows everybody to connect with everybody, but before that happens, they're going to have to come up with something like this. Before that happens. There's going to be an intermediate step and then the intermediate step will be no more privacy. You're gonna be able to watch people. Fuck. you're going to be able to do

Speaker 2:          01:16:04       everything all the time. Maybe we're looking at the negative part of this. I don't think. Now we can see. Yeah, that was going to say, now we can see people. Fuck, I could fucking watch you watch you. Not with my marrow blocker. I'm going to make when I make my neuro block or I got to leave latest

Speaker 3:          01:16:18       shit. Yo. That's what the problem. Everybody's going to have a leadership. It's going to be like computer viruses. You're going to have to always be one step up. do you know there's something like fucking 4,000 new kubota was at 4:40. how many computer viruses are created a day, but at some been fucking crazy number. Almost said bananas again, which would have been annoying. Caught myself to think about how crazy that is. They're going to get to a point where, I mean, how many is that? 40 two. How many are out there? Who gives a fuck? Our. Our point is ladies and gentlemen that are privacy is slowly going away and I think that that is a part of the natural evolution of the human race. I think that the human race iS evolving to something that is no longer to deal with embarrassment, no way. We're going to have a different set needs because

Speaker 1:          01:17:10       our environment has changed so radically from what our physical biology is coded for that. It's forcing this sort of an evolution of technology is forcing us to evolve as socially as well as it is evolving like technologically. Like as they come up with crazy and crazier shit that dissolves boundaries more and more, we're forced to play catch up and that's what's gonna happen. If we get to a point where there's no more privacy, then we're going to realize how ridiculous privacy isn't the first place. You know, we're going to realize how ridiculous embarrassment is. Shame and all the stupid shit. Like my daughter never wants to admit when she shouldn't. She's fucking too. She never wants a minute. You know, she'll shake your head, no machine making shit faces, you know, she doesn't want you to touch her. Like they get embarrassed. It's like it's, it's almost a natural coding in our system and I think eventually all that stuff is going to deteriorate.

Speaker 1:          01:18:01       I think it's going to dissolve, it's going to be crushed by innovation. I think that's what's going to force us to catch up because it's like the things that we accept as part of like our normal culture and the way behave. A lot of it is just just what we get used to. I mean, think about the shit that people get used to another country. It's thinking about the cultures and the weird traditions that people have been a part of like throughout history, amish people and you know, people who have plates in their lips and you know, and, and nutty motherfuckers who do all kinds of different rituals all over the world. You know, it's all what you get used to it. You know, we're just used to privacy. Yeah, we're used to it, but it's not necessary. This is going to be more important for us to get rid of douche bags.

Speaker 1:          01:18:41       It's gonna be more important for us to realize the importance of educating human beings and raising human beings that think correctly and to be responsible for the human beings you create and raise like you're responsible for your fucking dog biting something, but you're not responsible for your son, you know, like, uh, becoming a mass murderer, you know? Then it's just, oh, he got crazy. I don't know what happened. You know, if your son kick someone's ass and does a Bad thing to someone and breaks their property, you can get sued or you will have to pay for that kid's medical expenses and you have to. But if your son is some fucking mass murderer, I mean, what are they going to do? Are they going to do? Maybe you should go to fucking jail. You made a monster. You made someone that likes to kill hookers. How'd that happen? Oh, it just happened. We don't even know the fuck. You don't know. You did something terrible. You are so shitty. And raising a human being that you raise the human being that likes to kill and eat other human beings.

Speaker 6:          01:19:38       Because sometimes that's totally just nothing to do with parents. I don't believe that. You don't know. No. You think? I think there are some thIngs that happened to people genetically. I certainly think so. What do you. They recognize that. Yeah, but that's not how you connecting gay people. Serial killers. Because that's something that they're not trained to do. You mean that you mean they weren't raised in in sexual desires? This, that's just just. That's how you get people's eyes are blue. Some people's eyes are brown skinned people like you know, that's just It. Wires get crossed, likes to get sucked. Dicks. This person likes to stab somebody. It's how your brain. No,

Speaker 3:          01:20:12       that man sociopath's, they're not exactLy sure where that comes from and it's not necessarily that every serial killers or sociopath. Some people are just obsessed and insane and broken and they have a lot of other issues, but they. They think that there's a lot more sociopaths. People that don't care about other people's feelings

Speaker 6:          01:20:31       a lot more than you think. And they're not know though whether it comes from nature or nurture. I didn't really know a lot of speculation like your dad molested you stab somebody or your dad let you watch when you're watching hormones. Doesn't know if anything that's been proven that watching horror movies,

Speaker 3:          01:20:47       playing video games is a release. According to todd hollingshead from id software. He and I were having a conversation aBout this the other night when he was saying that that violence among kids has gone down since popularity and video games and violent video games has gone up. That it has sort of a cathartic release sort of thing.

Speaker 6:          01:21:03       That's what they believe in Japan to do. I think it's turning us into super humans with dre. I think there's better driving from video games the other day. Somebody just the world record for sniper shooting. A guy shot somebody a mile and a half away. You know, I think the video thing is video. I think video games, hand to eye coordination is off the fucking hook. I mean, when, if you think about it, like how much it is, like for people that play video games all day, it's all about hand to eye coordination. It's about shit like that. And that's amazing. Is that the use the same controller for the xbox? For those drones? Yeah. They use the xbox controls and playstation controllers. There you go. See? He used to doing that, right? I mean they, they allow them to choose. If you get to the army guys like can you do playstation or more of an xbox?

Speaker 6:          01:21:47       Whatever guy do that are different. WhaT we want to be remote boxes to me is like, you know, it's like marvel versus dc. There was never a dc kind of a guy like marble, right? Know, we'll fucking ps three. I fuck a playstation. Those are faggy sure. There must be dudes like that out there. Totally. They go into the army, but say, man, I was pissed off. I had to play with a playstation. I kill people with a playstation remote mad. I wanted to represent x blocks in my country. The navy is always nintendo. We were all just kidding. Just kidding, you know, but

Speaker 3:          01:22:20       they, uh, they do pilot those drones with, uh, with the same controllers, which is really crazy. When I, when I firsT heard that, that they do that, I was like, that is genius. Makes sense. I mean, why not? These kids, they grow up and they're so goddamn coordinated, but that shit, if you want someone to be awesome at killing people with remote control devices, who the fuck would you get besides of that?

Speaker 6:          01:22:38       Yeah, they're, they, they're the masters. Would they use it now in the army? They use video games for going into cities and stuff. They have like, you know, call of duty's shit, dude. It's crazy

Speaker 3:          01:22:48       if you, if you, if you really watch like some young kids that are bad ass video game players, like I got a chance to watch this dude named fatalities at the. Jonathan wendell I think is his name. I met him in vegas too. It's a really cool guy. He's a ufc fan. I met him at one of the ufc and um, he lives in vegas. This dude is the number one. He was at least at one point in time the number one quake player in the world and I got to see him play live one, so it was at e three, the big electronics a thing in the conference or whatever the fuck it is convention in los angeles and I got to see him play quake live. It was ridiculous. Quake Is like fast twitch muscle fibers. It's all like with quake is if you've never played quake before and good for you because that shit will addict the fuck out of you that that shit.

Speaker 3:          01:23:31       EIght years of my life, it's an awesome game and you're in this three dimensional world. It's a first person shooter, so you're holding a rifle or a rocket launch or something and you're running through these really complicated three dimensional mazes and you're fighting other people in near real time and it is real time. If you hooked up to computers out and you play against each other, it's so fucking fun. It's so fun. It's so crazy. It's fucking bananas. Bananas again. God, it rockets are flying and rail guns and you're electrocuting dudes with a light gun. Lightning gun, lightening bolt gun so much goddamn fun. I watched this dude play this guy alive like he played like challengers, like people will step up and play them. It was the most, the most ridiculous rape you've ever seen in your life. IT will be like brock lesnar fighting my cat. That's what it was like. I mean these guys would just get destroyed and you watch this guys like hand eye coordination. You're like, man, that's incredible. To get that good at one specific type of games, get locked in, you know? That's totally applicable for like warfare, right? Fuck. We're learning how to kill people with video games. It's like that starfighter movie where they went and they put a game out. The scene would be awesome

Speaker 6:          01:24:43       games. It's like all based off like a video game or something like that was going to get into the world. Yeah. Matthew broderick was. See, that's. See that's a movie you can't watch nowadays because that's gay. If you wAtch that, you were like, this is the most unbelievable bullshit ever. I watched aliens the other day when I was watching aliens. They had the scene where he was talking to the computer and the computer's like old old ass text. They haven't even figured out a graphic user interface. There was no idea that that would ever take place. So it was computers were all lights all around you for no reason, but was all lit up and big and stupid. It's like, oh, that's your computer, you know? That's how ridiculous is that. It's like star trek. It's just. Yeah. So who knows what the fuck is ever going to happen with the smart dust shit. But you know, I find it amazing that this is something that's on, you know,

Speaker 3:          01:25:30       cnn labs on, you know, on the internet. But I'm not hearing about this anywhere. Is anybody hearing about this?

Speaker 6:          01:25:38       Sure. That was published April 1st. By the way, was it? No mayfair, you know, just double checking out there. It seems ridiculous. That was yesterday. It does seem ridiculous or something. But it was yesterday.

Speaker 3:          01:25:49       So this is a real project, a real thing. If that's really happening right now. I mean, are they gonna? Let us know when it goes live.

Speaker 6:          01:25:58       Don't see how like the government's allowing that to. They're just doing it. There's

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       no, there's no precedent. Yeah, but it's like google maps, they're, I mean, they're there, they're doing some nutty shit man. They're just just. I mean, google maps actually has gotten in trouble for a few things. There has been some, some disputes about what they are in cities, but what these guys are doing is, you know, I think they probably feel like they're just creating a network, you know? I don't know. I don't. I mean maybe they're exaggerating the capabilities. Maybe there's some dispute about what's going to be possible and what's not going to be. But the bottom line is they're not going to stop here. They're not going to stop with this. You know, if this is something that creating in 2010, what the fuck are they going to have in 2020? You know, what, what are they going to have in 2030? There's gonna be some nutty shits on. It's getting fucking crazy

Speaker 2:          01:26:48       or it's like us talking about 10 years ago and nothing really like, oh, we don't have vcrs anymore. We have blue ray, you don't spend a lot of things have changed in 10 years. Yeah, to a point, but then you're also thinking like

Speaker 3:          01:26:59       on the high end level will the high end, but the higher end of technology things have changed drastically. Like with the large hadron collider and those guys in. Whereas I think it's a Massachusetts that are trying to recreate a son or trying to figure out how to make a fucking son. What, what is that about? I don't even, I don't even know the exact specifics of that case. You know, I'll, I'll look it up. Scientists trying to create son.

Speaker 2:          01:27:24       So a ufc comIng up. It's crazy that he injured his shoulder hit.

Speaker 3:          01:27:29       That's not this ufc. That was another one. What's one is a familiar one? I think his, his, uh, his. He was on the undercard of a rashad evans, I think. I don't know. be honest with you. Yeah. Nuclear fusion scientists attempt to create artificial sun on earth. Oh, nothing's gonna happen wrong there. That's definitely going to be fine. They're goIng to make a fucking son. We're going to have a little portable sons that exist all around the earth and that's, you know. Yeah. Unless it blows up like the fucking oil town. What if you have your own portable sunday? Just followed me around and kept you warm. Yeah. Unless it blows up like the fucking oil tanker. Could you Imagine? Why do you always look at the bright side of things?

Speaker 2:          01:28:11       Why do you guys look at the bad side of things together? Out? We're like the odd couple like tom and jerry. There's two things on the shoulder, like the devil and the angel. Jerry. ThIs animal house son. Remember everything I guess.

Speaker 3:          01:28:25       Yeah. It's been on a million things. There was a comic that used to do an act like that. Norm macdonald was making fun of him. Remember? Remember he had like a logical, logical left brain. Right brain. I'm so look, we don't know what the fuck is really happening with the smart dust, but you got to.

Speaker 2:          01:28:41       I can imagine snort and people were going to find a way to take a snort. It may get high off of it.

Speaker 3:          01:28:49       This, this got high up the smart dose dude, the hp shit. Yeah. This is hilarious. The research that this is, despite these differences, researchers say the dust theory, that monitoring everything will benefit. Humanity remains essentially unchanged. They believe that this will benefit humanity to monitor everything. Maybe. I think they might be right. I think we might have to accept the fact that technology is going to keep moving forward and if technology keeps moving forward, what is the end result? What's, what's going to be at the end of the rainbow? What? What is? Is there a singularity as ray kurzweil would say, or you know, terence mckenna says, you know, timewave zero know is there a moment of ultimate novelty, a moment, a moment where they create something that's so fucking crazy that it changes everything. This is probabLy the beginning, man. This smart dust shit is probably the fucking beginning. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:29:42       google was probably the beginning. That was a part of it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:45       Oh man. Google's browser. That chrome browser is fucking amazing. It's my favorite browser by far. So this nuclear fusion thing, this, this, these scientists trying to create this, this actual artificial sun or you know, a natural side. Yes. It would actually be a son. I mean it's of the same elements of the stars may not have. Right? I mean if it's a son, it's a son. It's not like a fake tit. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:30:07       Maybe it's the fucking son. Well, maybe they're just used throwing that name son around. It's just a really hot light bulb. Well, it just seems. Wait, wait, wait. What's a son? It's a planet.

Speaker 3:          01:30:19       If you want to, if you want to look it up. It's in the telegraph. Bright star as of yesterday. Oh no. Okay. No, it was published in since it was published in 2008.

Speaker 2:          01:30:30       Two thousand eight. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:30:32       Oh, so I think they're moving. No, it's not a hope student there. They're moving. Oh my god. Look at it. Where it is right there. Jesus christ. This image of this thing. It's like a fucking x men inside the target chamber. We're scientists will attempt to create an artificial sun. What the fuck, man?

Speaker 2:          01:30:46       Yeah, but what's the latest update? I don't know, research shows that these two guys are just smoking. A lot of weed didn't exist. It was. They just made it in a rush. It's pretty fascinating when you

Speaker 3:          01:30:59       listen to it. While it seemed impossible goal for nearly a hundred years, scientists now believe they are at the break on the brake rather of cracking one of the biggest problems in physics by harnessing the power of nuclear fusion. the reaction that burns at the heart of the sudden they really think they could do this.

Speaker 9:          01:31:17       Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:31:20       Are people allowed to have like the, the, the, the ingredients to make a son. But you know, it seems like it. You shouldn't be allowed to make, have the ingredients to make science.

Speaker 3:          01:31:28       Well, I mean, what we can look at the manhattan project basically harness the power of his son. You know, that's a nuclear energy is right,

Speaker 9:          01:31:36       right.

Speaker 2:          01:31:37       Say you're not allowed to buy weed, but you're allowed to make nuclear explosions.

Speaker 3:          01:31:44       Fireball. this is sort of an older story. It seems like I'm fine and from 2008 with no a

Speaker 2:          01:31:50       no updates, updates, find whatever that scientIst is names, and then just google that guy's name and then under more options in google, click the last month. You crazy. Fuck.

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       Yeah, it seems like december 27, 2008 is when the, uh, now here's 2009 again. Oh, they're trying to make it in 2018. That's when they believe that will be fine. But those, the bottom line is some shit is fucking happening. That's the bottom line. These, while we think about tiger woods and you know, you hear the news, new show they're putting together to trying to put together a show where tiger woods mistresses are the, a get together with Jesse James, mr says, and they got to search for love. They're going to have like a game

Speaker 2:          01:32:30       all together here to make it a porno. Adam the one main porn star that supposedly fucked with tiger woods, just making a poor. Now with tiger woods. Lookalikes,

Speaker 3:          01:32:40       you could make, you could make real shows with all those girls and people would tune in every week. You could just put them as a cast, that's what they should do, like a scandal that comes out, they should take the cast members and put them as a cast on other shows like you know, like they'll start out with like a, you know, you put them on the apprentice, you know, like see if you can figure out a way to make a business, you know, now you know, you don't have any more money coming from tiger. You've got to figure out what you're gonna do. You're going to have to make money and you're in the public eye. So let's put you on tv. So they get on the apprentice and they try to figure out if they can start a business. Well that's no good. Well, uh oh, I always wanted to be a singer.

Speaker 3:          01:33:14       Okay. American idol. And you put them all the whole american idol. The whole season tigers. Mr says, well, you can't sing. Can you dance? And put them on dancing with the stars all the whole season. Tigers misses on dancing with the stars. You know, I mean, I mean how many more fucking, how many more of these stupid stories can we have? Wild shit is going on like people trying to create songs and you know, and these little tiny sensors that go over the world, how many people are aware of the smart dust stuff, the pr, the amount that this should be a huge fucking story. There should be something that makes everybody's jaw drop. When you step back and go, what are they gonna do? They're gonna monitor everything. What does that mean? What does that go? Does that mean? I mean, when is it going to start with just little bits of information like there's a, there's a person in this area as they can eventually get to a point where they can have your image and you could see everything everywhere and eventually are they going to get to a point where you're going to be able to tap into that shit with your fucking.

Speaker 2:          01:34:09       It just seems like there should be voting before this would ever happen for real,

Speaker 3:          01:34:12       but there's not. There's no voting on whether or not we go to Afghanistan. You vote a president in and then the president gets to decide all sorts of fucked up shit that nobody wants. If you allow the american people to decide, 90 percent of the shit we got involved in would never happen, so we have it set up where you don't get to decide. You get to decide on who gets to decide. That's what you get to decide on, which is fucking ridiculous because the idea that one, gosh should be trusted to fucking run everything in this day and age where as much as we know about how complicated the world is, that's fucking nonsense. That's total nonsense, but yet we accept it. The right way to do it would be to have everybody vote on things. The problem with that is people are fucking stupid. They're really easy to manipulate.

Speaker 3:          01:34:55       You could. You could tell them all sorts of shit not true, and the dumb ones would all buy it and the dumb ones are more than half. So now what do you do? So it's almost like you have to have someone who you think is pretty smart to get into power so that he could make the decisions for you guys and look out for your best interest, but that's when money gets involved and they get fucking corporations and the corporations come the long money to make sure that you get an office. But once you get an office like yo man, like we really like the oil that we're getting from the amazon jungle and we like to keep getting that shit. And you know, there's some places we like to cut down some trees. There's a lot of bitches. Hayden

Speaker 10:         01:35:27       got you. I got you. I got you. You want the trees? It was good.

Speaker 3:          01:35:30       This is what we do. We're going to go over there and we'll give them a giant as loan. They can't pay back. And then when they can't pay it back a little jack, um, take their shit. And we've been doing that since fucking the beginning of time. There's, there's money involved and when there's money involved, you can ever have a real power. The real power can't be isolated in one area and they can't be like all this influence where like one group or one person or one organization gets to control shit because then everybody's going to be trying to kiss ass to that organization to get them to do what they want so that they can, they can conduct business and that's what we're dealing with. That's why people can't vote for everything because a real democracy would wouldn't work. We're, we're, we're fucking babies were infantiles.

Speaker 3:          01:36:10       There's no way with the way we've been living our society, like were there some big daddy looking out for us? You know, there's no way we can go from that to like being able to be completely free and vote for everything that happens. It'd be too complicated right now. That's just going to take a long time, but I don't think it's ever going to happen. I think something's going to just bypass it and launch our culture and launch our civilization and to the next stage. I think we're never going to evolve as we are in this, in this form. I think this forum is all about fucking and violence and chaos and laughter and nonsense. That's this life, this life, this life is all about love and friendships and shit you like to do and fun and it's hang on, hang on to the big ship that is humanity because some shit is going to change and you're about to go through a new door and when we go through that new door, all this shit that you even worrying about about whether or not you should get a mac or a pc or whether or not you're a democrat or republican or whether or not you like family guy or fucking fuck those hooks.

Speaker 3:          01:37:09       I like south park. You know? That's all going to be nonsense when the big change happens and I think it's common. I think it is really fucking comment and I think you see things like this little smart dust thing and you see things like people trying to create sons and you see things like what's going on with with the fucking oil spill, where this going to be? Some radical changes. The way people approach extracting oil from the ground. Now people are going to demand this is going to be a catastrophe, you know, I think some shit is change and I think shit is so freaky, freaky to think that this ridiculous notion of 2012 being, you know, the end of humanity that is a date you can actually track that. It seems like it's happening that way. It really would not be shocked if december 20, first 2012 actually does turn out to be some sort of crazy invention or insane innovation that catapults the human race into the next stage.

Speaker 2:          01:38:04       You guys are going to be, it's going to be nothing. It's going to be completely nothing. It's going to be like turning 2000. It's going to be like the computer virus that it might not be

Speaker 3:          01:38:14       dude, or it might happen before then. I mean, it might be a rough estimate, but I think there's going to be something that takes place and I think it's going to involve.

Speaker 2:          01:38:20       La has been added earthquake. I think that's definitely gonna happen. I think so, yeah. I think that's just lately I, everyday on my, uh, chrome or my homepage, the thing that pops up is my google page. One of the things my widgets is the earthquake map for los angeles. And if you've been watching ever since that earthquake in san diego for the last, what was that? A month and a half ago? Squeak expert? Or is this just rambling? No, this is. I see the same eye. I've Been falling earthquakes just as a hobby I guess for the last seven years I go to this website that just shows like the earthquake map can do it. If you believe in the secret, you're creating earthquakes, right? No, no, no, I'm not. But anyways, like manifesting it current earthquakes and ever freak you goddamn earthquake projection center. Yeah. It just shows you that the earthquakes recently, but ever since the san diego, san diego earthquake, there has been so much activity in Mexico, like maybe, maybe 100 times more than it normally is.

Speaker 2:          01:39:17       Like just, well this one's an earthquake right under the house of some crazy mexican drug dealer. I know that's what I'm saying. You need to put a layer drug dealer in layer map over this google map to see what's going on because ever since then, like a month and a half ago, it's been retarded. You have a fear of earthquakes. I don't have a fear, but I'm interested in them and it's just weird. Like everyday, like right in the last whatever, couple of days a week there's been 920 earthquakes in los angeles or in California and usually that hovers about that same number. LaTely though, almost all of them have been in san diego

Speaker 5:          01:39:50       so much. Shit that can fuck us up man. There's so much focus on.

Speaker 2:          01:39:55       I have an earthquake fetish. That's right.

Speaker 5:          01:39:58       Oh, I got another good story. Let me make a out about how about this guy who.

Speaker 3:          01:40:03       The courtesy of the pee pee pee bucket. You can't even hold on. Wait up here in the flashlight. oh, don't do that. Don't go in the bathroom while you go in the bathroom. I'll take. I'll take questions and when he comes back from the bathroom, we're going to talk about this dude. His name is george wreckers and he is a christian right leader and he just got busted with a twink. I love these stories, man. This dude is like this real staunch anti gay activist. He's a, he's a board member of something called the national association for, uh, research therapy of homosexuality.

Speaker 3:          01:40:41       And it turns out he's really gay. it turns out that, you know, he was trying to pass all this legislation. He was a, he's in the american college of pediatrics or have pediatricians and apparently the America american college of pediatricians. ThAt's like the name of it, but it really like they hand out literature according to this one website, choosing gays have something called copper ofelia, clp r o p h I l I a, which means sexuality while playing with shit, copper ofelia. So they were accusing gains of this copper ofelia, this failure, this obsession, the sickness and you know, and saying how terrible gays are and how adopted children that are adopted. Gay families are all fucked up. And meanwhile this dude, the entire time was banging dudes. It's really goddamn classic. He was, he was caught on vacation with something called a rent boy.

Speaker 3:          01:41:36       He went to rent boy.com rent boy.com. and this is what he advertised for the guy. This is the guy that he went with. He has a smooth, sweet, tight ass and a perfectly built eight inch cock uncut and, and explains that he is sensual wild and up for anything. So the cash. this dude george records of north miami, they catch him, the leading scholar for the christian, right? They catch him at a terminal with this gay escort and started taking pictures and this is what the guys excuse was he says, I had surgery, I can't lift luggage. That's why I hired him.

Speaker 1:          01:42:16       Him. That's fucking awesome. And is pretty good. That's awesome. I think the tickle parties, boy.com, if you were a gay dude and you were so tired of people fucking with other gay dudes. And so coming up with all these laws that make it impossible for you to get married and make it more difficult for you to adopt children and make it more difficult for you to, you know, get all sorts of shit. You know, that, that shouldn't be denied from you because of your sexual preference. If you're not doing anything to harm anybody else, it's ridiculous. They wouldn't even entertain that. There's something wrong with it. And this one motherfuckers just going off just involved in so much, so much legislation, so much.

Speaker 3:          01:42:57       So much activism against homosexuals. And meanwhile this fucking dude advisory roles with congress, the white house department of health and human services and testifying in a state's witness in the favor of florida's gay adoption ban.

Speaker 1:          01:43:11       motherfuckers going to rent boy.com getting twinks. He's getting twinks. If you know what twain started twinks or the the little boys that gay dudes like gay dudes like 19 year old boys are like, I'll have any muscle. And they look like little boys twinks. This dude was going and getting twink. Twinks had surgery. Surgery was twilight fans or something like that? No, no. Twinks, the original twinks is a little, a little gay dudes. My mom's rude. Dang, because she was calling me a twink. Wow. Just called you a twink. I'm sure your mom doesn't know what that means. Your mom's got some fucking betty boop definition of

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       somebody that likes hard candy that she heard on little rascals. You know, whaT the fuck does she know that this is like the ted haggard

Speaker 3:          01:44:03       case? Just as good. It's like so many of these cases. There's been so many of them. It's almost impossible to math. Um, you know, uh, god, what was that guy's name? That was a. he worked for marc faber, who was another guy, right? there's been so many of them. So many people that are, that are, that are anti gay turn out to be gay. it's a favorite. The one that was trying to bank kids. He was trying to bang. He was gay and he was trying to bang his assistance and his, uh, one of those congressional pages. That's what he was doing. I think that's his name. Favor, whatever. If it's not, you know the fuck I'm talking about it. It's, there's so many of these guys that are trying to fight against gay peopLe and trying to stop people from doing things and they turn out to be gay. How do they not know that people are going to check this thing? How do you. How do you not know that if you're a guy who's like just spending an exorbitant amount of time trying to fight the gay agenda, trying to stop gays, were having the same rights as straight couples trying to just suppress people. Wouldn't you think they would look at you? What do you think? They will check you out?

Speaker 5:          01:45:12       It seems like it's so weird when it's always the loudest person. That's nice.

Speaker 3:          01:45:16       It's an incredible. The suppression of others for no reason. When you look into someone trying to suppress someone else's wants and desires for no reason, you have to look at that person and you have to scrutinize where they're coming from because that's not natural. That's not a natural thing. Like why would you care? They're, they're gay. They're having fun. You know what do you give a shit? As long as he doesn't try to fuck you, you, you shouldn't have a problem with them. You know, there's a bunch of gay people, they find the other gay people, they have a good party together. Who cares? Why do you care? You know? That doesn't make sense if you care. But if you do care and you're out there fighting and man, we got you. We know now. It's like, it's obvious. It's all of you. You know what I mean? How many of you, how many of you, the Larry Craig guy? I mean, how, how many of you have to get busted? It's, it's, it's fucking bananas.

Speaker 5:          01:45:59       Shit's bananas. Bananas. Bananas is sponsored by chiquita. I should be. Yeah, but I'm going to be sponsored by the fresh water because fucking my manager and kiss my ass by the way. I can't stop thinking about this ridiculous dumb fuckers. Don't fuck it. I kissed it. Tasted real to it. I hope some big fat, sweaty dude was inspected by number two. It was perfect.

Speaker 3:          01:46:33       Yeah. There's another senator. They got busted watching porn and congress. That's hilarious. Yeah. There's too many fucking people out there telling other people how to live their lives. It's ridiculous and we shouldn't tolerate it anymore. You know? At a certain point in time we have to say, fuck you. That's enough. You know, it's too. It's too crazy. And every one of them that are telling people what to do with their lives and what they shouldn't be doing, it doesn't hurt that every one of them are fucked up across the board. Whether they're musLims and want to throw rocks at you for drawn pictures of muhammad or dancing or the fucK it is. Whether it's catholics, whether no matter anybody that's trying to suppress your behavior, they're all fucKed up. If you're not hurting anybody else, you're fine. Nobody's got this thing wired. Nobody. Nobody is control of the fucKing oil.

Speaker 3:          01:47:18       Nobody Knows what's happening. The one was pouring out of the ground 40,000 fucking a day, brian, at least who knows? There's no no answers folks, and that's important because if we're ever going to get past where we are now, we have to realize that no one is. We can't leave the control to like someone who we think is more qualified than us and someone who's on it, like obama or the idea of obama or some any guy being president and being on it. You can't be on the world. You can't be on the country. It's impossible. Nobody can. And we have to accept that and until we do, we're going to fucking hurdle out of control.

Speaker 3:          01:47:56       I agree. And even if we do accept it, I think it's too late. I think what's going to save us and what's going to change us is technology. That's what I think. Yeah, totally. I think when we realized, I think we're slowly starting to realize how full of shit people are. We're slowly starting to, as we get more and more intrusive into people's lives, we're, we're, you know, we're exposing like another level of, of understanding of human beings and busting politicians and busting. I mean, there was stuff like that guy that got busted. Uh, elliot spitzer. Spitzer. Yeah. In New York. I mean, nobody got busted like that before. Nobody's ever gotten better happening in jail now. Well, you know, that guy was a guy that was a very vocal about the market, about the market being all fucked up and corrupt and you know, and, and talking about all these companies and he believes that that's one of the reasons why they went after him and that's why they're one of the reasons why they prosecuted, persecuted him.

Speaker 3:          01:48:51       Meanwhile, the guy was busting people for prostitution and he was using prostitutes, you know, he was like, that was like another example. He was a guy that was like all adamant against we're going to stop prostitution. like, oh, what a good thing to stop. Stop people getting their dick sucked. Like, well, why would you do that? Why don't you give a shit? You got to really put so much effort into that. Well, it turns out the reason why he's doing this because you just covering up the fact that he's using them. Like why wouldn't he is no different than all these crazy gay activists that are secretly gay. You know, he's hating. He is trying to cover it up.

Speaker 6:          01:49:27       So we should look at anyone that's like a huge, like loud person on a certain topic, like the guy that likes slim jim's that went to snap into slim seems probably hates seeing it correctly at all the time. I was just joking the what we have to look in as anyone.

Speaker 3:          01:49:44       The formula, in my opinion, and this is what I've seen to have out of it. You have to look at anyone that is trying to suppress the behavior or the desires of anyone else where it shouldn't concern them. Whether it's someone who is trying to stop you from whatever the fuck it is, whether it's masturbation, whether it's anything. If they're trying to suppress your desire, if they're trying to stop you from marrying other gay people, stop gay rights, look at them, look at them, find out what the fuck it is. They're trying to suppress prostitute. We gotta stop prostitution. Find that guy. He's getting his dick sucked is paying for it. He's a fucking freak. He's a freak and he's crazy. All the people that are trying to suppress people from doing things that don't affect the person who's trying to stop them from suppressing things.

Speaker 3:          01:50:29       Just leave people the fuck alone and if you don't lead people to fuck alone, you're the problem. You know, and that's really what It is. This eliot spitzer guy, you know? Yeah. Maybe you were exposing, you know, these, these flaws in the market. Maybe you were exposing corruption, but guess what? douche bag. You were also getting people locked in a cage because somebody gave somebody money to get their dick sucked, which is fucking nonsense. In 2010 you can, you can go to jail because you can suck someone's dick for free, but if they give you $5, you're a bad person. That's ridiculous. It is ridiculous. That's completely ridiculous. And then any, anyone who's trying to suppress anybody else's desires or needs and they're trying to suppress them in a way that it has nothing to do with them. You got to look at them. They're, they're all, they're all fucked up.

Speaker 3:          01:51:16       They're all doing something shitty. Yeah, I agree. I'm glad you agree with me. That was a. That ramp tapered off at the end, right? It's pretty good. At the beginning I had an important point, but somewhere around there, through our market, these things, you just, you lose the creative magic in formulating your sentences. You know, I like your setup this week. It's awesome, but one thing I think I just killed sperm, that laptop on my lap, just cooked my boss. What are you going to do it like? I do it. You have the laptop off to the side. That's the move is if you put your laptop, if you move this thing and you put your laptop like you put your microphone here. Folks were fucking ghetto stuff. Planned out situation there. So we've covered everything that I want to cover as far as ufc predictions.

Speaker 3:          01:52:02       People Keep asking me use predictions. I never give you a few predictions because who the fucK knows it's going to happen? I'm the super exciting fights. The main event of course is spectacular. Leo machida versus mauricio shogun who a very, very interesting fight. You know, a lot of people thought that maricio won the first fight, but if he did win it, you know, he didn't, you know, it didn't kill him. He didn't, he didn't really, um, you know, he didn't stop him. He never really heard him badly. He never really had a real dominant moment in the fight. He just edged them. A lot of people felt like he edged them and a very exciting fight. And I tHink that, you know, leonardo is going to have a completely different strategy most likely for this flight. Very excited to see that he's a very strategic dude.

Speaker 3:          01:52:42       And uh, I think also he's going to be the both guys got to be more prepared. They're going to know what the other is capable of. They're going to review the first fight and go over mistakes, go over when they landed and you know, and go over like maybe tendencies that each might have that might, maybe they can exploit. So I think it does. The second fight is going to start out a chess match. Now they're going to be a both guys going to be doing things that they think are going to benefit them in this fight that maybe they didn't do in the first flight. Maybe we'll find guys might start off the fight a little bit more cautious. That could be interesting. You know, cfo maybe show them, plays the role of a counter striker initially or maybe they Just get to it like it's around six.

Speaker 3:          01:53:21       Maybe they just fucking go out each other. That's very possible to, you know, um, maybe that even more so because of the controversy involving some of the fights lately where guys haven't been exciting like the anderson silva fight where he kind of slacked off over the last two rounds and people even criticizing jose aldo for his last round of his fight. So If that's the case, if they're affected by that stuff, maybe they might come out and try to prove a point. I don't think that's going to happen because to too much is at stake and both guys are too dangerous. They're both two of the most dangerous and explosive guys in that light heavyweight division. And anything can happen. So that's my prediction for the main event.

Speaker 6:          01:53:56       Karate guy, his cheetah. Cheetah. do you think, what do you think his karate as well?

Speaker 3:          01:54:00       Martial art in general. Well, what machIda does is very smart is he combined the good things of karate with more thai and jujitsu and wrestling and boxing, you know, but there's a lot of good stuff in karate. The, the ability to leap in and leave out like the way they fight. They're very. The footwork is different than like moitai guys, more thai guys, more like they learned that their light on their feet but they weighed in and they get real close to each other and attack, you know, and they check kicks and attacks the karate guys, they're all, it's almost like fencing, like explode, explode out. And if you're not used to fighting machida he's super hard to deal with because that, that explosion that is fucking throws you off many. He leans way back and he dives in and he's super accurate with things and iF he catches you with one of those, he could fuck you up.

Speaker 3:          01:54:44       it lightens you up like pot shot at you from a distance. You're in trouble. That's what happened to rashad evans. He started just lighten them up. He started like laying back and he comes in and blast them and then once he does it a couple of times, that's all he needs to do. You don't even need to hit you a couple of times before. You're like a little bewildered and he's so good at that. He did that too. So could you. You know, he did that to tiago silva. Stopped him at the end of the first round is a fucking killer, man. He's a killer and he's going to be trying to do that even more on shogun den in their first fight. He's going to be more fired up, more motivated. I think he's going to be even better. And then show gun. He's got to be super confident because he feels like you won that first fight. He feels like he got robbed them decision. So he's going to be confident and he's gonna be fucking coming in guns blazing and leo's going to be confident and the other is going to be more motivated, better strategies going to be an awesome fucking fight. Okay.

Speaker 6:          01:55:32       Are you just, you just go buy a karate studio and you're just like, okay. That little 15 year old has a black belt, you know, that's your sport that you can get a 15 year old can be, have a black belt. Are you kIdding? Well that's

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       the problem with the thing they call the mcdo. Joe's joe's the muck jo jo syndrome is that, you know, when martial arts became popular in America, I guess in the sixties or whatever, when people started watching Bruce Lee movies in the seventies and shit, what happened was people got really into karate and karate became a business and they open up karate schools all over the world, you know, and people wanted to learn how to kick people's asses and then it became like some bullshit mysticism thing and a lot of bowing. And they're very cult like, man, if you never been to karate. Schools are a lot of martial arts schools. My taekwondo school is very cult like, you know, they're like, you know, the, the, the, the sensei can do no wrong. And everything is. Yes sir. Yes sir. It's like they're never a, an even and equal with you, which is one of the beautiful things about jujitsu.

Speaker 3:          01:56:28       Jujitsu is totally the opposite. Your instructors just liKe you. He's super cool and just like you, you don't have to call them. I mean, if you do call him sir. It's out of respect. But he's gonna I approached her brother, my friend to call me sir. You Know john. John would shadow would laugh if you call them. Sorry. He's just a friendly, cool guy that knows something that you don't know. He's going to show it to you. So like jujitsu, the, it's way more rare for a 15 year old gay black bell and it really, really hard to get your black belt in jujitsu. Martial arts, they have much lower standards than jujitsu. Most of them do. And karate. A lot of schools can. If you go to a real karate school, like a real, you know, okinawa and karate school or a cushion karate school where they're like really like rigid traditional, old school.

Speaker 3:          01:57:09       WaIt, no, they're not going to give you a fucking black belt if you're not ready. You got to get that back, but you gotta earn that shit. You gotta want to masa yamas fucking schools. One of his affiliates, you know those guys that's. Those are serious hard motherfuckers. Those, those karate tournament, they fight in especially the kill cushion karate tournaments. Those dudes are fucking animals. They don't punch to the face, but they kick to the face and kicked the body and kick to the legs. They're fucking tough, man. That's a. That's a hard, hard sport. So our hard martial art, if you go to those schools, you're not going to be able to get a nine year old and get them their black belt. But if you go to one of these, like fred valori schools, they used to be like the united studios of self defense when I lived in Massachusetts for fucking 12 years old and you got a black belt that's ridiculous and you can't crack an egg. Like they don't have any idea how to fight. They don't. They're completely lost their, they want to do like high kicks and catia and fucking knife and strike you. Like they literally don't know how to fight. They like taught how to do this stupid dance, you know, they don't even have contact when they spar. I can, most of the schools.

Speaker 2:          01:58:08       Could you hear that? The boy scouts now have a badge for playing video games. I thought it was crazy because then that doesn't that defeat everything that boy scouts about like adventures outdoors and yeah, they have a video game badge and like government man, they want you to become a.

Speaker 3:          01:58:22       Or they want you to target their drones. Could you hear obama made a joke about fucking drones? How do you know the, you know, the whole thing with obama and he told jokes and jay leno told jokes. Jay leno kind of bombed. No, I didn't hear about this. The white house. I think there's a white house. White house press correspondents' dinner. I thinK that's what it's called. Right? You didn't hear about this. Why I ignore all

Speaker 6:          01:58:42       you got to checK this out because it's fascinating.

Speaker 1:          01:58:44       Obama goes on and, and, and everyone's like, obama did so well. Opie and anthony were the only ones that said obama didn't do well and I fucking completely agree with them. He just butchered the jokes, like the timing sucked, but the jokes were pretty well written. I think some of the guys from the daily show or something running for him and um, the jokes put his delivery is terrible. It's all clunky and, but he, he got big laughs. But one of the jokes he did and no one's even talking about this, one of the jokes he did, he said, the jonas brothers are here. Where are you? Jonas brothers? There you are. And he said something about his daughters, you know, that his daughters, uh, you know, his daughters are very beautiful, but I want to let you know, don't even think about it. I've got two words for you. It was like spy drone or soMething. Drone. What of those drones called by drones. But like you said, I have two words for you. I like unmanned drone. Like what, what, what are you saying? Mr. President, you're joking around that if one of these boys, who by the way are like the most wishy washy, chris

Speaker 6:          01:59:49       non-offensive non-dangerous, they have fucking these white. You're upset at how these bracelets on. Yeah. Dude drawn away and fucking called it. I think that's pretty funny. It's not funny. He's talking about things that kill innocent people every day. I use that thing in Pakistan and those things, they launched them in the, in, in, into these villages and launched some of these mountain sides and people get jacked left. Yeah. But you can also say that sorts of people that get killed. You could say that about jokIng about anything. airplanes, anything. You know, I mean there's a. You can joke about black helicopters, but black helicopters kill people for the government. Patchy helicopters, you know, I mean drones. That's pretty funny. He says taking something that's like kind of in the news,

Speaker 1:          02:00:28       your example is ridiculous. And, and here's, here's the thing, when you're the president of the god damn United States, it's just like when George Bush waS president and he said, where are the weapons of mass destruction? None under here.

Speaker 6:          02:00:39       Right? It's like looking under his desk. Yeah. But drones aren't just made for killings, for spying and stuff, you know, they have hellfire missiles on them. They're there to find people that are bad and lost, but there's also implying he's going to spy on the jonas brothers. He's going to kill them. Right with, with something that they've been killing people with light lighthearted. It's not like that's. I think that's attacking somebody that you want to attack the person. I think that's ridiculous. If you're getting angry about that. You think that me saying that, him saying that is attacking him. No, no. You're obviously taking it like in America, right? I can't believe he's joking about this shit. Go man, brian, when you're the president of a country that is literally fucking the whole world. I don't see that

Speaker 1:          02:01:17       evolve into wars overseas and these weird things that happened in Pakistan that are, I don't know who approves them or how exactly they work where they have these drones that fire these missiles at these people that we don't like and all sorts of other people die,

Speaker 6:          02:01:32       but that's not something I would joke about if I was the president, but there's plenty of shit to make you think that he's joking. Also kInd of acting

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       like my mom getting mad about him. I can't believe he said a joke. It's a dumb joke. I don't know why he would think it's funny. I don't know why he would think killing boys that want to fuck his guy thing. It's fucking hilarious. It say that to the jonas brothers. I would say that hilarious. It wasn't a good job. It was like you've got the worst response of any of his bits. It wasn't well delivered either. I think it's brilliant. I can't believe you think that because I think I wouldn't say that if I was the president that's retarded, which is saying something really. You don't think there's any comment and that there's something very serious about being a person who's responsible, at least indirectly for many, many people dying because of these fucking drones. Many people crying. Many families devastated. Many people lost theIr children.

Speaker 1:          02:02:19       Many people lost their loved ones gone forever, but because it's taking place in Pakistan doesn't freak you out. what did we use involved In drone attacks in Ohio would have kids you went to high school with got fucking killed. They got their legs blown off because obama is using drones to target al qaeda in Ohio. Wouldn't that wouldn't? You're saying, well, what if though joe, you're saying, what if not, what really happened? He just brought it. I see what you're saying. No different than Ohio for you to think that it's okay and Pakistan and not okay in Ohio because I didn't say it because it's. That makes it a what if joe, you're making. You're making it seem like that. I. I'm that sensitive about the middle east and stuff where I'm not. I don't think about that shit. You know, you're getting really sensitive about our war and our troops and everything.

Speaker 1:          02:03:00       Oh, I'm not thinking like, oh, I just made a joke about murder. Yeah, I figure you're getting really sensitive about obama just doing a bad job. You know? That's just a bad joke. It's a ridiculous, irresponsible joke. I think to make a joke like that in the middle of two wars that people don't approve and all these things that are happening in Pakistan with unmanned drones, I don't think you should be making jokes like that. It less. They're fucking hilarious and that show was lame as fuck. I think it's. I think it's pretty funny for it when, especially when the president says, I think it's hilarious. I think it makes our president seem edgy. I think it seems like he's not playing dumb and trying to butter like nerf are fucking ears. He's actually saying something that's like, wow, that's kind of blue. That's kinda crazy. Dude.

Speaker 1:          02:03:42       Military the president does now the key to the drums. Oh, so his joke is not only, it's not correct as well, you don't think they would let hIm borrow the key so he could kill the jonas brothers? Is that what you're trying to say? Thank you very much for trying to answer. Yeah, but you're saying like you're, you know your, like your joke on baby blowjobs, you're saying like, you know, that's bad to say, you know, how many people are child molesters and stuff. If I wasn't, no. Here's an example that you need to use. If I was a child molester and I was out there below and babies and then I did a joke about baby blow jobs than it will be the same as what the president is doing. So the president is killing people with drones right now while the president is the spokesperson for the country and the country is in fact at war and has military that is killing people with drones. I just, I see it as at the top of the food chain. I see why. I see why you're upset, but I just, I just don't see it. I just didn't see it. I understand that you don't see it, but I think it's hilarious. Understand. Here's the open. Anthony were mad too about this. Um, no,

Speaker 3:          02:04:38       I think they were talking about something else. we're talking about his jokes bombing. they would just send me that they were, you know, they were open. Anthony were set at his delivery. His delivery was Tyler Norton. Norton was going crazy. It was run on norton, but he's also loves jay leno, you know, and he was honest in his assessment of jay leno. Jay was like rushing through it. He was lIke rushing through his joke, but the jokes were lame. He knew he had bad jokes and I think he thought it was going to be an easy crowd and he could just squeak by, you know. But, but I think he realized when he got there that there was some pressure on him. I think a lot of people don't like him now they're poor. Fuck, you know, everybody's all mad at jake [inaudible]. He took his job back. Like why does everybody give a shit? you know, conan o'brian gets 35 fucking million dollars and it gets to go to tbs, whatever.

Speaker 2:          02:05:21       That's funny how he straight up lied though on the, on the um, what are 60 minutes the other day about twice, twice. And he said that the reason why he got fired, not lenovo, because his payout or leno's payout was more or something like that. But they are like, nbc is like, that's a lie. Their payouts were exactly the same. They also said something like, uh, maybe he didn't know. Maybe it was just mistaken. Well, he didn't. There was another thing somebody told that by agents or something to something about nbc losing money. But what I find odd though is that I checked ratings the other day. Jay leno's ratings and conan's ratings are almost exactly the same as they were. If you were going from year to year from last year to this year or whatever. Exactly the same. So there's no money. There's no like leno's number one makinG $50, million dollars extra month. It's been. He was saying he was, but maybe before. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          02:06:10       for what they're thinking, that he's eventually going to bring it back to where he was beFore that he's gonna take over the reins and, you know, have it back to where it waS because when he left he was number one. Yeah. I don't know man. The whole thing is this, a stupid argument is like, who cares? it's just entertainment and not only that, it's not the best entertainment. If kony had a talk, not a talk show rather, but like a, um, a sketch show, I think that would rule. That's what I would like to say because I think conan's the best parts on conan. It was when he does those sketches, like when he did those, uh, the baseball player, the 18 hundreds baseball players when he went there and played baseball with them and he was talking 1800 speak fucking hilarious. That was way better to me than his interviews. And these interviews are cool, but most of the people that he's talking to, it's like, what are they doing? They're just selling some shit. I jusT want you to see their movie. They just want you to buy their book or wants you to listen to their music. It's like, you know, it's like he's just helping themselves. Shit.

Speaker 2:          02:06:59       That's really all it is. So bad in general of how bad, like a jimmy fallon, they have a whole. They had a whole like 10 minutes sketch the other day on subway and it was a commercial and it was like people were, there was actors involved and they were like doing skits all about subway. Oh, subway subs. Subs like $5. Footlongs was the whole thing they're talking to and it was an ad for like 10 minutes.

Speaker 3:          02:07:21       So. Oh well, you know, if it was funny, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have a problem with it. You know, especially for the flashlight, one commercial where they rip off Brian Collins act. There's a commercial, like an old spice commercial where this guy's like doing. Look at my stance

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       on the horse and the horse. I have an apple tv. That is brian calories serious. Fuck. That's like one of the most popular commercials I do like super rich. Now That guy sounds like brian couns act and all these people are saying that, and apparently advertising executives do that all the time. They see comics, they go to comedy clubs and get an idea from their ag. Here's something, here's something weird. There was a movie called miss march. It was a, I forget the pli. I was half drunk watching this movie and uh, the chat or it's the craig robinson, is that his name? He played a character in this movie called horse cock dot mpeg. And the whole time I'm watching it, it's like they call listens character. Yeah. And that whole thing, they'll joke was his, that his character. He's a rapper named horse cock dot j mpeg. And the whole time I'm thinking like, that's kind of weird because of your horse bit material about being a mr han's dot mpeg. No, that's weird. But it's weird that like, how there's so much similar things like that. And I'm wondering like, you know, writers and people in marketing and commercial and stuff, if they really just, you know, that's a real connection and anybody could come over really hotdog mpeg. Look, it was a real video Man. yeah, but only you of all people focused in on a point that was called mr [inaudible] dot [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          02:08:48       No, I don't. I think that's silly. I'd absolutely. That's what it's called. You can't. I mean, just because I've talked about it on stage. I mean that's what. That is what it is. You can't say that somebody stole

Speaker 2:          02:08:57       that. I didn't say it. I just think it's weird that there's so many similar things. Like you're saying, right? Brain talents that's stealing. I know they stole it.

Speaker 3:          02:09:04       You know, the, all these comics have recognized that, that it's like the guy's like doing a version of brian callen, you know, and probably, you know, he doesn't even know probably. he's probably just some actor and he's funny and he just has the same voice. No, it's not the voice. It's the, the, the, the way brian talks about things. He exaggerates like sometimes I just take a horse stance. I just stand there. He's got a ridiculous act like look up, look up my body toned and defined. I'm eating a peach, sometimes, like to eat a peach. This guy's like doing callan callan has this ridiculous character. It's like someone doing that. You might be a redneck character like going up and doing jeff foxworthy, even if he's not calling himself. Jeff fox were like, you know where he got that came from. But jeff foxworthy famous was Brian Collins, not famous. like if brian cowen was super famous and then this commercial was out, everybody would be like, this guy's ripping off brian cowen, you know, I was like, he's doing brian cowen. I think that shit's real common. I think they do it all the time. Cell dies. Hmm. I don't know about that. Sam. Tripoli seems to think so. Sam shirt play things. A lot of things that aren't true. Really? Like what? Oh, it's

Speaker 2:          02:10:03       two hours and two minutes. That's just about it. So next week we're going to fuck. We're going to this week we're going to fuck one a's, right? We're going to talk.

Speaker 3:          02:10:10       Nah, you know what my manager, I'm sure, but not want me to fuck one of those things. Especially this one whole wine bottle. Well, you're already seeing it. The shit out of that one. UM, so, um, I think the, I mean definitely send me some twitter messages if you think that it's ridiculous to, uh, you know, to think that I should not accept a because somehow

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       this is going to hurt my career. I think it's ridiculous. But I would like to hear your thoughts. Am I allowed to accept it? Yeah, you can. We can split the screen down in the middle. This is brian's part of this show is sponsored by fleshlight. My side is not hearsay shuchita banana long and I want to let cbs, nbc, and abc know that I'm ready and willing to do your family game show chiquita banana on this side flesh. So, uh, I'm doing, what do we need back here? Do we need a monitor or do we need a green screen? That's the other question is should it be a monitor or green? Sixty inch led 3d dlp, dlm. No. Lcd samsung.

Speaker 3:          02:11:16       that when you have people at home would have to watch with goggles on and we will be blurry and everything else you'd be in three days. Awesome. no, that's ridiculous. Probably wouldn't even work. I probably wouldn't transmit through this little shitty ustream. What if it did

Speaker 5:          02:11:28       fuck's wrong? So, uh, there's a question too. Should we do a green screen? I say yes. I'm looking at it right now. I'm like, it would be dope if we have an image of Space behind us. That's the move, right? You have to do that. Apparently we can't do that with this stream producer though when I'm worried about, is that the, the uh, ustream producers, the only way we can get this thing up on itunes or we're just using the eastern producer to take the signal out to the internet. So we'll plug this into your computer and it'll be an input on eastern producer. So we'll still be able to use. You should produce or. Yeah, you should. You know how this thing works for sure. I can try castor figured out in five minutes. That's how easy it was.

Speaker 3:          02:12:05       God damn genius. Without him we would be doing the same thing, but it would suck more and probably the sound would be going on in the background. All right. Green screen. Most people think so. I think that's what we're going to go with. Let's unanimous. Thank you. Everybody. Like, yeah, it's all green screen and everybody's saying greenspan, they don't want to monitor monitor as a gay greenscreen is cool, right? Yeah. All right. So that's what we're gonna do. That is the next stage. So we have this and check this shit out. Look how this thing does at the end of the show. I go like that and it goes down fucking crazy, man. I got that shIt at z gallerie yo. So, uh, that's our show. Ladies and gentlemen, we will see you next week. Tuesday as always. You know, how we rock it basically the same every week.

Speaker 3:          02:12:49       And um, hiS thing is slowly but surely getting more and more, more and more complicated, but more professional, smoother. The sound for the itunes version is going to be way, way, way better now, um, with these professional microphones and the high end mp three player and all that jazz. Um, the video should be better now as well. And, uh, eventually, like I said, we're going to have that and next week we're also going to have hd camera. So we'll have two cameras to choose from so we can switch back and forth, just get crazy. And uh, eventually we're gonna have this thing set up like a real studio. There's another, there's another couch chaIr over here and we'll have it lit up better to just right now it's kind of funky. Um, so, uh, it rolls on. Thank you very much for 200 and I'm glad you guys enjoyed it. Fleshlight fleshlight.com is where you can go if you want to fuck a rubber pussy and uh, that's it. So we'll see you next week. Take care.
