Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Chilson and non coffee enthusiasts. Coffee, coffee, noninclusive.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       Well I drink it every day and I like coffee, but I've got a doctorate a little bit, you know, I've gotten copy mates and the hazel nuts. I've got to do all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:00:16       Uses Jazz Stevia. No, no, but may I is good. Yeah, please. It's stronger than sugar so don't put it in like you would do sugar, but it's a completely natural available everywhere. All sorts of health food stores and whole foods carries it. It's a uh, just a plant based sweetener. Not Sugar. Not Bad for you then give you the DAB. This doesn't, um, doesn't fuck with you. Like aspartame does. Some people don't like the taste of it, but I like it. And the fact that I can get away with it where I can drink and I know there's no sugar at all. I like it a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:00:49       Are they a sponsor? We do an a plug right now. I don't like it. I could say I know about safe sex. We don't even sell it. So I'm a fan of it. So here, here's my theory on coffee and I think this is true. If if coffee wasn't around and I discovered it and I sat you and Jamie down and I slid a cup across the tape and go try this guys, I want, I want $50,000 from both of you. I'm going to build this coffee. Taste this. You'd go, you're out of your mind. You want to give me a dollar? They'd go, no, no, no, no. Not only, not only am I going to sell this for a profit, I'm going to put sprinkles in it. I'm going to put it in a fancy cup. I'm, I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Mix whipped cream on top and sell it at 300 percent profit. You could just get out

Speaker 1:          00:01:29       and tell you. Well maybe, I mean a very small niche market maybe. I mean, it's not like it's going to be everywhere. It's not bad, right? That Stevia is good. It's not bad. It's Kinda like a little bit of a bitterness to it. It doesn't taste as good as sugar, but for me it's a good compromise knowing that there's no, nothing negative about it,

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       but I'm going, this is how you start your show. I like this. No Big Internet. You just turned it on. It's not necessarily share the man. No one else could pull that off really good. They just need to do it. If you just didn't worry, if everybody just didn't worry, they would just do it this way. I suppose you're right. So whatever we talk about today is, there is nothing going on. No, I mean it just seems like it's just nothing happening. It's just an average Monday, a couple of coffee drinkers here. I, uh, you know, we're all trying to figure out if they're going to sell, sell or not. Right? And I'm on the other side of the fence from a lot of the reports. I'm going, God, I hope so. What a cool thing. I mean, they can sell the work they put in the risks.

Speaker 2:          00:02:27       They built this interest in that. The ultimate thing you want to do with the business day one, when you sit down to start a business, you want to create something so cool. Somebody else wants to buy it, so I'm on the other side of the fence. All of these reports were coming out like this was going to be earth shattering news. I'm good. This is going to be great. This is if you like them, if they've done something for you and you're cheering for him than cheer that this goes through. Particularly if you retain Dane, and that was the other part of the report was that Dane was gonna. Stay on. Well, that's relevant. There's not another. There's not another guy alive that can run that and that's not some nice statement to Damon Damon. That's just the truth. Like you can't go to a library and check out a book on

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       fight promotion. You can't go to any college and major in

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       promotion. You either know it or you don't. Yeah, it's. It's difficult and it requires all day. Like Dana's working all day, like people for people that don't. I'll call him at like 1:00 in the morning and he just got off the phone and he's doing deals and he's making things happen and he's trying and he's obsessed with it. I mean I got really does love the business of putting together fights. We will. I'll, we'll talk randomly just in the middle of nowhere about fights for hours. He just loves to talk fights. He really is a big fan and obsessed and not burnt out yet, which is amazing because the amount of hours that guy puts in and obviously he's making a shitload of fucking money, but it's still the amount of hours that he puts in. You would think he would be cooked by now.

Speaker 3:          00:03:45       Yeah, you would. And I know what you mean. One am is a good time to get ahold of him. I was in Brazil. He called and woke me up. I was doing the ultimate fighter. He walked me as 4:00 AM and I grabbed the phone and he was talking business right away and I just said, Dane, I got, I'm not here. Right. And whatever I agreed to right now, I get a pass because if you give them your word, that's it. Right, right. Whatever I agree to does not see I'm out of it. It's 4:00 AM. And he goes, Oh man, it's 4:00 AM. And I said, yeah. And he goes, dude, I thought it was only two. I'm really sorry for calling. But he was, he was serious. He was serious. And so it was like, okay, I get it, man. If you're working on. And it was the office line, it wasn't his cell line. He was at the office and I'm going, okay, well look, if you're going to work for him in Brazil, what time is that in America? That's got to be 10. They're not that far ahead. Where are they? They're there for six hours. I was in Sao Paulo, so it was still, you know, he's in there grinding.

Speaker 1:          00:04:38       That was a ballsy move. Have you to do the ultimate fighter in Brazil after you had talked mad shit about virtually every legend that ever came out of.

Speaker 3:          00:04:50       Yeah. And to understand. Thank you for saying it, but it's also relevant to understand how big MMA is over there. You get away with that here and there's gonna be some pockets that know exactly who you are, but it's going to be just that pockets in Brazil. It's the number two sport behind soccer. Everybody knows. And I had a, I had armed security. We went everywhere in bulletproof cars and uh, and one night I'm the guns came out and whatever bravado you think you have or you think you will have when the guns come out, you find out it's not true. You're scared. What happened there? This is an actual move, like there's a name for this and it's very common in Brazil, but we were going to traffic and a guy cut in front of us and then what they'd like to do is cut in front of you, slow down and they get boxed in. They jump out and rob you. So when the guy swerved out, we're in three lanes, traffic. There was nobody else on the road. So when the guy cut in front of us, security knew right was going on. They pulled their gun out, my wife was in the back and she was sleeping. She was laying down, she had her feet across me and uh, I woke her and I said

Speaker 4:          00:05:58       he got his gun and uh, there was an exit right up and the guy swerved over as quick as he cut in front of us, took the exit was gone. Nothing happened at all. But in that moment you find out when the guns come out, what ever macho is you think you're going to have in that situation? You don't have to, were you think in like, why did I talk all that Shit I've just said, yeah, I had no way to know I was in the car. I mean, I think they were just getting ready or at least the, the security thought they were just getting ready to rob us, you know, it had. But yeah. Yeah, I did. Yeah, that's true. You know, that's true. Getting. Can nobody here take a joke, am my job, but ended up being a great time. It ended up being a really great time.

Speaker 4:          00:06:41       The ultimate fighter just isn't generally. I had the opportunity to have them, but you build lifelong relationships. You know, you stay friends with those guys. You watch them being vulnerable. You watch them putting their whole life, everything into it. These get leaving their families. The first ultimate fighter I did, we had two holidays. I'm counting thing. A Halloween is when I realized that isn't a holiday, but if you have kids that's a big day. Skies leave their kids. They don't get to see them dress up and then we had thanksgiving. They don't even get a call home. One guy had the birth of his first child. He did not get to call in and check on his wife. I mean it's. It's a big deal. What goes on and they are very strict. I don't know why they are joe. I realized that for reality TV that, that, that, that turmoil is build something, but I'm kind of looking at going, you know what?

Speaker 4:          00:07:24       Let's do this little nine to five deal. Send them home, give them their cell phones. Let these guys just be regular guys. People talk too much. They tell too many secrets. They, they explain what's going on to talk to press. They give inside scoops and will only be revealed, you know, I promise you this won't be revealed until the show goes to air. There's a lot of fuckery that goes on with, with people that are on reality shows. That's what they're trying to overlay. A funny word fucker. He's one of my favorite words. Great words, but yeah, there's truth to that. But you are your appearance on the ultimate fighter in Brazil with vangely to it sort of changed like vandalize public opinion right now is very, very high. Like people like him again, and one of the reasons why they like him is because he got fucked over by the Nevada state athletic commission, hardcore.

Speaker 4:          00:08:10       They banned him for life, for missing a drug test, which I just think is fucking tyranny. I think that's straight bullshit. I think that that is a fucking horrible miscarriage of justice. If you think the guy was doing something, then you find him and you, you, you banned him for the amount of time that you need to based on if he was guilty. That's it. You don't get to do life that's fucking crazy to do, to be so callous to show that you are a governing body and that you are taking care of the future of these athletes and supposedly protecting them from other athletes that are cheating or from from whatever other nonsense, whatever other illegal activity might be going on, and to take that position of power and into flagrantly abuse it in that way where you're just, you're, you're openly showing

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       them that you don't give a fuck about them. You don't care about their career, you don't care that this is the only way they have to make a living and you just going to ban them for life because they missed a drug test. So let me, let me give you another side of this too. Vandelay never told his side. Vandelay got pissed and he yelled and he went to, created all of these things, but he never just sat down and told his side calmly. So here's vandelay side, and when you hear this, you're going to, you're going to side with vandelay. Here's what happened. I was the first guy ever tested, uh, in this random out of competition testing, so none of us knew what it was. And you have to take that time into perspective because now guys understand, look, you get a knock on the door, you must, you must comply.

Speaker 3:          00:09:35       But I was the first one ever took, we'd never heard of this guy shows up. Vandelay was to be the second one tested, but did it, did it test. In hindsight, I shouldn't have tested. I'm not even sure they were within their rights. And this is relevant. They show up. The guy has no id, absolutely no identification of who he is. I think that's a problem to start with you then. He's a huge. He then wants to take me into a back room which ended up being a janitor's closet, not sanitary, a backroom at the MGM grand. He takes me in there where I must disrobe and present to him my penis because he, w he watches, you know, that's a very private thing. And the ID, he wants to see your dad and if there's a look and they need to. I understand now and I think a lot more of us do to that you're going to have to get naked and do this so you get wisdom.

Speaker 3:          00:10:23       You got all these weird things going on at that time though. That's a weird thing that we're in the back of the mgm grand in a dirty closet and I'm presenting to a stranger who refuses, not only doesn't offer id, refused to give id and I tried to take a picture of the son of a bitch and he told me I could not do that. Why I backed down and did it to. I don't know. I just accepted his authority, but in hindsight call me. I'm at. Yeah, exactly. I should've. I should've, but I was caught off guard that had never been done before and I'm kind of just going along, but I am caught off guard by this. He then wants to stick a needle into your vein and draw blood. I'm in a back, unsanitary room. Anything I've ever learned in school. You don't do things with intermediate needles.

Speaker 3:          00:11:06       You don't take. This guy has no idea. He's not in a lab coat, doesn't look the part at all. Uh, so now I presented myself naked to him and now he's got a needle in my vein and I'm signing paperwork that I haven't had time to read. So when he goes to now understand, I speak English, we at least speak the same language. Also take into consideration that kind of got in fairness, perfectly nice guy trying to feed his family, but in fairness, what kind of person says, I want to go around and collect people's Pii. It's an interesting kind of guy. So I'm with. I'm with an interesting character to start with. Now I'm naked. Now he's poking me with needles in a dirty backroom at the MGM grand. He leaves there and goes to test vandelay. Well, when you take everything I said into consideration, nobody knew about random testing.

Speaker 3:          00:11:50       Nobody knew about a sudden. Nobody knew anything about this, that out of competition, silver vandelay to go, hey, I don't know who you are. You're not presenting it. I don't fully understand you. That's fair. And vandelay talked to them and said, you want me to sign a contract? Get my attorney on the phone, show me what this thing says. You know, he's Kinda going through the p and the way the story was told us that vandelay just turned and ran. Well, that wasn't true. He stood his ground and talk to this guy for awhile. He said, get on the phone with an attorney. Prove to me who you are. He did all of these things and then finally said, look, I got to get to a press conference. I'm leaving. Got In his car and drove right to the MGM for the press conference and I didn't have this backstory at the press conference, but that's what vandelay did.

Speaker 3:          00:12:25       So when the story came out that he turned and bolted out the back, that's not true. He stood and talked to the guy. He tried to reason with them. Vandelays never told calmly his side of the story and that's his side and that makes a lot of sense. Even in today's standards. That makes sense. But back then when no one knew that drug testers could be showing up, and once they showed up that you needed to present yourself naked, that you needed to accept, uh, you know, that they were going to draw blood. Yeah, man vandal. He had the right to say no. Call my attorney. I don't know. I don't know what's going on here. And the guy wouldn't show id that's relevant as very relevant when they banned him for life. It's crazy. Come on.

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       No, you, the way you describe it. I didn't know it. Was that okay.

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       Yeah. I never told him what all he's done is yell. And I've always thought, no. Wait, vandelay timeout. You've actually got a really good site here. Come and tell it now. Under today's standards is a little bit different. Um, because we know what's going on and we know there's,

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       don't know that some crazy Internet troll can't pretend he's a Usada guy. Show up. Drag you into a bathroom and take a picture of your Dick. Exactly. And they will and won't let you won't. Let, won't document who he is. We'll let you just take a simple picture of him. Well, that's insane that they don't have to show Id. I mean that. That's tyranny right there. There, there has to be some sort of due process and the athletes are already in a disadvantageous position in the first place. I mean, they, they can be fired. They mean this, this random thing that just shows up, which I don't want. I don't know what kind of constitutionality or what, what kind of legalities involved and just randomly testing someone's bodily fluids. I mean, I guess you sign a contract agreeing to that, but boy, that feels. That feels shaky. Yeah. It feels like that can be disputed.

Speaker 3:          00:14:04       And to your point, you now do sign a contract and you agree to go into this pool, but back then we did not, you know, I was, I was the first guy. Vandelay was the second guy. Uh, we both ended up with suspensions, but it was different. It's like, well, Hey, wait, if you're going to do this, you got to tell us or you or you got to tell me right on the spot, but you've got to at least prove who you are. And I would imagine the women must have women testers come out to watch them, but I don't know that for sure. You know, you hear this thing about these tsa pat downs and the women feeling violated. We haven't heard any women's say that yet, but at some point, you know, I just think there's a fine line there. They might have to be a little bit careful.

Speaker 1:          00:14:38       Well, vandelay had his lifelong suspension thrown out. Right? So now he's still in limbo though because they haven't decided how long he gets suspended. And what they've done is. And by the way, how many years ago was this when this took place? Three, three years ago. So the man has not been able to earn a living in three years doing what he does best, which is fight. And he is, he's a legend. I mean, if you're going to have a mixed martial arts hall of fame and you don't include vandelay Silva, you got a bullshit mixed martial arts hall of fame. I mean, you talking about a guy who was the pride champion for a long time, you know, had incredible fight, legendary fights and his beloved. My point was when you and him went at it on the ultimate fighter, his fucking popularity crashed because you made them look foolish. He looks silly. He wanted to start a fight with you. He was trying to intimidate you and it wasn't working. You're like, please don't touch me. Please don't touch me. And then finally you wind up taking them down and just like Jesus Christ, like, what the fuck are we doing here?

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       Yeah, it was, it was really weird. And uh, you know, trying to explain that to vandelay on the set, what was a battle to and, and vandelay walked out on the very first day. He demanded an apology. He said, yeah, he comes in front of everybody. Cameras are rolling. We're about to pick teams. So it's got all the guys there and his way of taking the moral high ground was to demand. I apologize and if I don't then he quits. It's like Vandelay, why'd you put yourself in that position? I'm not gonna apologize, but why would you say you're going to quit now? You have to quit. Now. You have to walk out. So he does. When I, when I call his is he walks off the set camera, stop everything. They put us in the back and, and I'm telling the producers I'm not going to come out and apologize.

Speaker 3:          00:16:23       Call Vittorio Vituro. Come out and do it. We'll have torn a plane. That's how we're going to solve this. Now we can't call it a uh, yeah, we get. We got to work this out with Angela. Could you please a pledge? I said, look, I want this show to go forward, but this is the storyline. The storyline is the bad guy has come to Brazil. Vandelay gets to be the White Knight on the Horse. Let's continue the script. So I had to talk to vandelay and a private room and I had explained that to him. Like Mandalay, I get what you're doing here and you're trying to be the good guy, but guess what, you are just let me go do what I do. Okay. You will come off as the knight in shining armor and I'm okay with that. You're not okay being the bag. I am.

Speaker 3:          00:16:59       You Go, do you let me do meet the scripts already out there. That's why we have this job. And I couldn't reason with him Joe. He really did not understand it. And he does. He's saying, Oh, you know, on and on and on and uh, you know, I, I, and I broke it down to a zoo. Yeah, he was doing that. I was breaking it down and he's telling me how I'm doing everything wrong and in my sportsmen ships off and, and my promotions. But, and I said, stop. I said, George St Pierre Left Brock list or I'm the guy. I'm the highest paid guy in the UFC right now. I'm not the guy you tell how to promote. I'm the guy you cop and I was just trying to level with them. I'm the guy you copy. That's the reason that, that all these things are happening. And uh, he, he agreed with me on that. He goes, I understand that, but I don't like how you did that. I don't. Like I said, great. Then here's what we're going to do. We're going to do this show. Okay, I'm going to to be the bad guy.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       And then we're gonna fight. And if you're so sure you're going to. I mean this, this, this is your moment. And he was ranting on me for the andersons thing, I, I said, did you see how that fight worked out? Okay. I took my punishment, man. I had to eat it all. It's an embarrassing thing, but I did it that, that's my payback for that. You and I are on a separate deal. You're trying to insert yourself in an Anderson fight. Anderson already took care of that matter. Okay. He handled his button, but now you've got to handle yours. And it was just a weird thing and we just, we just couldn't. We just couldn't come around. Well you are an interesting guy to get into these altercations with because you're very logical and because you can say a bunch of crazy shit and not take it personal and I just don't think that he has that kind of mentality. His mind, his depression, but that's him. I mean he just wants to throw down and so he expected you to butt heads with them and you're like, hey man, come on. We're here to make some money. We're on TV. We're going to promote this zoo.

Speaker 4:          00:18:50       And it just, there was no fucking way he was. I mean he just came into this with this idea that he was going to go shoot the buck style that he was going to get in your face and get angry and maybe you guys were brought on the set, you know, but you just weren't having it. I wasn't having an end, but I also understood this vandelay I want to be the bad guy and this is my brand and this is what I'm doing. I'm the only guy on that side of the pool because I'm the only guy that's willing to be so I'm the biggest healing in the business right now, and I know this. If I come into your country by myself and not speaking the language and you team up, you gang, you team up on me, I become vulnerable. If they see me as vulnerable, they're going to like me.

Speaker 4:          00:19:28       I don't want to be like you're ruining everything. And I knew if we, if push came to shove, they're going to take vandelay side. I'm going to come and short, but in the world of public opinion, I'm going to come out on top, which I've worked very hard that I don't want to be on that side. That's not where I'm trying to be. I'm down there, okay, and I'm all by myself, which means I'm ruling that part of the market and I was pleading with him when he was trying to get in a street fight. I remember even saying to him, please stop like Vangelis, please. I don't this. I don't want to do this. Let's get a date. Let's save it for the octagon and he just, he, he saw that as weakness and as soon as he saw the weakness, he started picking on me.

Speaker 4:          00:20:05       He's like, vandelay, if you pick on me, I become likable. I don't want that. That's what this is all about. Okay, I'm down there. You guys be down here. Okay, I'll be the nerd sitting at the end of the pool by himself, but that's still my end of the pool. Will you approach this in a very calculated way, which is very rare for people when they're doing promotion for fights. You know, there's shit-talking, there's, you know, people say I'm the best ever. They Brag, they do all sorts of different things, but it's very rare that they purposely put themselves in one position and you did it on purpose and you, you are the only guy that really had a vision. You like, look, everybody out here is doing it one way, but there's a way to do it completely over the top, but you obviously

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       had skills to back it up as well, but you were completely over the top and you cherish the role. Like when you took the microphone, went

Speaker 2:          00:20:55       Anderson Silva, you absolutely suck. Like the whole place started cheering. It's like, ah, he's. He's gone straight pro wrestling. Like you're the first guy to ever do that, right? Yeah. Let's cut a promo. I mean let's tame attainment. You know we are an entertainment and I firmly believe when one fight ends, the marketing for the next fight begins right then, right? That are paying attention the most. When I hear people tell you all the day, who do you want to fight next and you're giving them an opportunity where your softball on them right down the middle and they say, anybody in their message what they, what they want to be related. I'm not a bully. I'll take on anybody. I'll take on all comers. I don't care. I get that, but that's not what people are hearing. If you say you don't care, how can you expect anybody else to?

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       If you tell the whole world, I don't care who I'm fighting, well then how in the hell can a fan care? How can they care about you? You got to care whether it's a personal thing, whether whether it's a career move, whether it's the title of whatever it is, you have to care and there has to be an answer. If you don't care. I don't care. Nobody's ever gotten a job job by telling the guy, interviewing him, I don't. I don't care. Well that I can't hire you. I just can't hire you. Yeah. Especially if there's someone who does care. Now there's a mention of when, when I tried to get in your podcast today, if you'd have said, hey, are you free on Monday? And I go, no, I don't care. You Go, well then I'll just call somebody else jail. I need a guy in the studio that wants to be here. What you do? I want to be here. Well, I wouldn't worry about that with you if you said I don't care. I said, but like good sales in a weird mood. This is going to be a fun podcast. Fair enough. But there's a. there's an

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       psychology that goes along with fighting and one of them, one of the things that happens to people when they're preparing for a fight, and you could speak to this, is that there's a sort of a compulsion or a, a, a feeling that you would like to avoid thinking about the fight as much as possible. There's, um, there's a natural sort of attraction to just putting it aside. Let's like, let's just not think about this. Let's not think about this at all. Let's only focus on the task at hand and when the task in hand is over, then we're going to take a break. And when a fight is over and the relief has hit, a guy like to shift gears and go straight into promo mode. Sometimes guys have done it and they've done it and it comes off artificial and it comes off clunky. It actually hurts them more than it helps them. Like it seems like it takes a very specific type of personality to be able to pull that off. Correct. Directly.

Speaker 2:          00:23:18       I think that's fair. Yeah. And I've seen some guys do it and I. Ben Rothwell comes to mind. Yeah, well we'll have some pocketed and even an awkwardness or something to see there. It's not a total miss. It. It does come across as pocket and scripted in. My only advice to Rothwell is if you have a pocket of statement and you're not ready for the followup question, drop the mic and walk away. Here's your bit. An exit stage left. And yes, it's very hard. It's hard to say something you want to say. And when the followup question comes, you go back into being yourself. That's very hard. You've got your look. If you take a character, you finished the character until it's done. And if you're stuck. Walkaway. Yeah. Like Daniel Cormier, when I interviewed him after he beat Rumble Johnson, John Jones, get your shit together. That's it. Perfect.

Speaker 2:          00:24:07       Yeah, it was great. It was perfect. So Dan, let's stay on. Daniel. Daniel this week was in one of the. It was a very weird spot. So Daniel comes in. He's not just a good guy of mma. Joe, he's the great guy. Daniel never will somebody meet that guy face to face, but what did your never will? What's amazing is how much he gets booed. That's my point, but everybody hates him. You then have John Jones who is a real life heal that wants to be loved and for some reason the crowd used to be against him and now they find out he's really find out who he is. They love it. They're in. Why do they? They love him more. They love him more. Now that he's keeps fucking up. Daniel Cormier was at a press conference with Jones and Jones says, I've been sober for three months, and the crowd goes crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:24:49       They then shift the camera over to Daniel. The whole crowd starts. We hadn't even said anything. They all start booing. Daniel takes a mic and goes, you guys are cheering that. He's been sober for 90 days. I've been sober for 36 years. They boom again. They hated it. So Daniel gets put in this weird spot. He brings that momentum into this fight. He then becomes vulnerable. His heart's out there. He shows the world that he takes the high road. He says, I think that Jon Jones made a mistake. I've made mistakes before. He starts telling these personal stories, his heart that he's in tears. Everybody loves him. All of a sudden he goes into the fight. Anderson, boom, people. People love the appreciation. He stepped up great middle, all these different things. Daniel gets beat or rather beats him. The crowd boos and the Daniel tries to address the audience explaining himself.

Speaker 2:          00:25:37       It's like Daniel, a couple of rules and politics. First off, you steer into a problem of a crowd wants to boot. You don't ever ask them for their approval. You take the mic, you hold your belt up high. You thank them all for the percentage of their ticket sales that you got. You tell him to shove their opinion up their ass and you walk away. If you're explaining, you're losing. Do not explain yourself. Do not say, I had to do what I had to do. There's such A. I'm tired of the misrepresentations representations and fighting. It comes all the way from the top. We hear that the fans want to guys that are going to go out there and bang, well, that's not true. The biggest draw in the history of the sports, George St Pierre, he never went up there and banged with anybody who finishes it is a very handsome man.

Speaker 2:          00:26:13       He's very marketable. I will concede that, but the bottom line is that's not necessarily what people want and the exact same game plan that did is what lester did five minutes later and everybody loved it. That that's not what it's about. What they decided they want to see Anderson when they weren't upset that they were on the ground there. Whereas if they weren't on their feet because they knew that's where I understood could knock him out and they decided they were going to cheer for Anderson Cormier. I should have just told him to shove it up their ass and they'd be stuck. Yeah, but that's not him at all. But he wants to be liked. He wants to be like

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       Joe, I understand that, but that's not the way to be. Like the only way to be liked as him to beat the shit out of John Jones. I mean that was the only way because right now he's got a title that let's just be completely honest about what it is. It's not a title that he beat the champion to get sure he had to take it away from the champion. And the public recognizes that and while John Jones may be screwing up a lot, he may have all these problems outside of the octagon, inside the octagon and no one has been able to best him. He's amazing. And because of that, because of that, people are on his side because people love winners. They just do, they love Mike Tyson when he was in his prime and you know, even when he came out of jail for alleged rape, he claims he never did it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:29       I don't know what happened obviously. Um, but when he came out of jail, they were still rooting for him. I mean, here's a guy who, if you have daughters, I have daughters, you know, if you have a girl and you hope, boy, the worst case scenario is my, my daughter finds herself in a position where a man wants to physically do something to her that she doesn't want. People didn't give a fuck. They were like Mike Tyson's back back and he's still looking angry and he's rip now. He's been doing prison workouts and there's something about a guy who's just a bad motherfucker that people love. Yeah, and there's a. there's a thing where they know that Daniel feels that there's a thing where they know that Daniel knows that John is the guy who won the first fight, that John is the legitimate linear champion.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       That John is the undefeated fighter and literally the only undefeated fighter at that level. There's no one. I mean he has one loss to Matt Hamill, which is a bullshit disqualification from a dumb fucking rule which said a million times. Nobody's more angry about that. Then you, Jon Jones is not as frustrated about that loss issue. Our madness. It's the law, the law. The rule is madness and it only exists. I talked to big John Mccarthy about this extensively only exists because the commission was ignorant. Sure. They didn't understand that those bricks breakers, it's not that hard to break a fucking brick man. Seems crazy, but it's really just not. Especially when they are spread wide like that. But John Jones has that aura of invincibility about him. Now, if he fought rumble, Johnson rumble, Johnson head kicked him into oblivion and we see John was toes curled, you know, lying on his back, snoring which absolutely can happen to any human.

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       Then the whole thing would change and I think the walls would come crumbling down and if John did a press conference and said he was 30 days sober, they will start booing them. They wouldn't give a fuck. I think that's fair. Yeah, you're right. America does love success. Fans are front runners. They've got the right to be, but yeah, historically that is how it worked and we're talking about rumble Johnson and John Jones. Man, we got to get that match up. We fuck they fucked up. I mean, the whole thing is fucked up and that in that, that hasn't happened because he's in real danger with clover like that. That air of invincibility was taken away from him by, by um, Daniel Daniel beat him and he broke Daniel, beat him down, took his back and choked him and you could see rumble, just having a real hard time with the, what was going on in that fight.

Speaker 1:          00:29:49       He had given his all and that first round he had hit danny with a bomb, like literally took him off of his feet, sent him flying across the octagon. But Daniel is tough as fuck. And he survived. He gutted it out and then he imposed his superior wrestling and wound up winning. So we lost a lot there because that fight was supposed to be Jon Jones and Rumble Johnson. And then Jon Jones Rumble Johnson would have been fucking epic. That would've been really interesting to see what happens when a guy who hits like rumble connects with a guy like John. And especially back then when we didn't know what would happen, we know that Josh Koscheck had beaten him, that he had real hard time in the later rounds when he was competing at one 70. But we also knew that there's no fucking way you should have been at one 70 even when fall [inaudible] 85.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       It was kind of the same thing. He came out like a bat out of hell and then faded. And then we assumed that he also missed one 85 against veto by seven pounds. Yeah, I mean he had a notorious problem with his weight. So we kind of attributed a lot of his failures to that. And we see him at heavyweight beat the shit out of our lawsky break as John the first round, just Tulum for three. And we say, well, okay, well rumble at two. Oh five is the fucking man. We missed that. Ms Dot opportunities.

Speaker 3:          00:31:01       Yeah, I agree. And you know, when you, when you bring up Rumble Rashad who trained with both John Jones and rob says, rumbled beats him. Now rumble only does have one problem. He is a front runner. He does fade a little bit, but that's a big storm that he brings, you know, rda fights that way. He started Amanda Nunez fights that way. Her own teammates. We're saying, look, if she gets into the second, third round, I don't know about this, but she's going to bring a storm in that first round Ou and I don't think Misha can survive it. I talked to Dustin Porsche, he trains with Amanda and he said that he goes, well, if it gets into the later round, she, you know, her percentage goes down. He said, but I think he or she's going to come out and she's going to put her foot on the gas, empty the tank. And the first, I don't think she's going to be around. And he's right.

Speaker 1:          00:31:37       Isn't that fascinating? Those fast twitch muscle fiber fighters, those ones who explode, the really dynamic ones, there's a, there's a fucking given a take to everything. Sure. And those, those ones, they just don't survive into the third, fourth and fifth round with the same pep.

Speaker 3:          00:31:52       So. So let's back up. I made a note here on that Jon Jones thing. Did you follow the whole johnstones drama and the most recent one? The only post drama? Yeah. Was that he had a press conference the next day. Did you follow that press conference at all? I saw the crying pictures of Jamie sent them to me. I went to that press conference and there was a couple of takeaways, and this is all speculative, but for this doesn't make John innocent at all. Well, John's guilty. They've got, they've got the stamp. Let's guilty, but his actions were not that of a guilty man. Historically, guilty guys go bury their head in the sand. They tried out run this thing. They get with their legal teams. They show up at the hearing. They hope for the worst, for the best. They get the worst and they deal with it.

Speaker 3:          00:32:32       John face the music. Twelve hours later he came through the hotel. His whole life's pulling apart right now. I imagine he didn't even sleep that night. He comes to the hotel with the fans. He comes into the media pr one. One says, you read a script that was written for you and you exit the stage instead. He read no script, he took every question asked of him, and that's just not what a guilty guy does. Not understand that he's guilty in terms of data, but what we care about, his intent was he trying to get over on somebody, was he trying to hide something? His actions would represent that he did it, but here's the problem with the press conference, Joe, when you hold a press conference, you have, you have one goal in mind which is to win over the media and that they say nice things about you before you do go home and bury your head in the sand.

Speaker 3:          00:33:15       Secondly, you want to break something. You want to get something out there to get ahead of the store. That's the whole reason you show up at these things. The only car that he had to play is what did you test positive for? That was the only thing we didn't know and they refuse to reveal it so that that was a little bit weird and where I was sitting because I've been in John spot in here was the thing that happened with me. We're, we're talking about John, this whole thing is going on with John based on a test that took place on June 16th. The reason that relevant when I went through my thing, I was he tested positive for semesters in blockers. Those don't really have anything to do with anything. They don't help you. They're silly. I think you might've just revealed something.

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       Yeah. He tested positive for two estrogen. No one else knew that. There you go. I'm revealing. You broke personal information. That's what we're doing here though. Right? Wow. But this is like, this is like the only way that anybody could find that out is if you talked about it. Boom. It's out there. Right. And that we're doing here, aren't we? Creating some news. It's a big news day, but let's say, but here's The relevance and let me tie myself into this. When I went through this job, I had something selling in there. In fact, I had an estrogen blocker. I have something silly in there and everybody forgave. I was. I was going to be suspended, but fox, every I was fine. Everybody looked good. Okay. Well, you know, we changed the rules in the test and everything was fine, but what I had to live with, what only I knew there was another test out there, but the results hadn't come back yet and I didn't know what that test was going to show.

Speaker 3:          00:34:44       I know what it could have shown. I know what it should have shown, but I know what the other test could have been, should have as well. So you're sitting there hoping, how good is this damn test? That's all you're thinking about. Well, we, you and I had a conversation. You're the guy called you on stage and I'm blowing you up. You're like, hey man, I'm doing a show. Can I call you tomorrow tonight? I will stay in capital letters tonight. I need to hear from you tonight. Yeah, I remember the exact words. He said, well, you know, we were wondering how stringent these new tests are. Turns out they're really good. Turns out it's a pretty good test. Turns out it's not like the old, a one, 800 requests a test that costs $99. Okay. There's a reason this ca, this test is 40 plus grand, but the thing that I'm, I'm, I'm wondering, does John have another test out there? If he does it doesn't mean it's going to come back, but that was the same spot I was in. There was a shoe that could drop for me. It did for him. Is there another test out there? And if there's not, the facade

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       has got some explaining to do. If you're telling me a guy that's got a track record, the tested positive for cocaine going to fight in the biggest fight of his career and the last time you tested them was one month before the bout. Then it was. Sod has got some explaining to do, but there's more to the story now. What do we hear it? Does he pass his, the end up in the spot? I don't know, but that's, that's the piece that's still missing.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       Well, there's one aspect to his, uh, test is positive test that people are saying could possibly play a factor and it's a supplements that he could possibly have been taking something that like, this is what happened to 10 means this is what happened to um, allow Ramiro where they get a supplement and it says it has a bunch of stuff on it says you look through the ingredients. Okay. Creatine [inaudible], we're good, we're good. But then when you run it through a lab, it turns out there's a bunch of other stuff in there too and that's why it's so effective and that's why it sells. So it is possible that that could be the case. We don't know yet because then if that's the case then John has to give them all the supplements that he was taking and then they have to go to a store, buy them independently, test them and verify that these ingredients were in not just the bachelor, the hands them, but also in other batches. So it's not like he doctor did show some stuff in there. Sure. But estrogen blockers are usually when people are getting off of steroids,

Speaker 2:          00:36:56       right? When you're coming off a cycle, it's a blocker. You know, men don't want estrogen anyway, but it's a blocker. It's not going to. So as far as that substance goes, and that's all that's all he's going to have to live with. You're not going to have to explain how they work for someone who doesn't understand what an estrogen blocker will do if you up your testosterone than your estrogens has naturally ups. And guys don't want estrogen. So if you're a guy, you, you take a blocker that can block that, bring it to you, you won't get a, you know, I'm trying to think of a word Guy Gasta. I can't even. I can't bitch. Tits is all that comes to mind. I can't think of the word guy. I'm a guy. I'm more closed. Guy Got a go. At any rate, it can stop some of those things. So that's the speculation. And the reason that that's on the list is they find that that's a way they can catch you after the fact, Hey, if we missed you during this cycle, we can catch you here.

Speaker 1:          00:37:43       Well, it's not just that. The reason why they take it after the cycle is because you get hypogonadism, your, your, your body stops producing testosterone because you took exoticness testosterone. That's right. And so the. To restart it, they'd take this stuff, these estrogen blockers.

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       That's right. Yeah. I tested positive for an estrogen blocker and it was that exact thing. Same thing. They banned testosterone. I went on something called Hcg. She'll return your testes back on and then you have to clomiphene, which is by definition an estrogen blocker for that same thing, but it can also help get your body going back on testosterone. So they're band. John's got a problem, and again, this goes back to the press conference. He said, I have not taken anything new that I have not taken my entire career. So somebody gave him a follow up question. He quickly realized what he just said. And he goes, wow, I do have a new supplement company. I have taken some new supplements. So he realized, put himself in one point needed to get out of it. The supplement company then who dropped him immediately came out with a press release that do not put this on us.

Speaker 2:          00:38:42       We don't have anything to do with that and we'll turn over any samples you want so that that's. That's the downside to holding a press conference is if there's anything that commission hates, it's when somebody isn't honest with them. Well, if there's anything who a hates and it's with Lance Armstrong found out it's when you deny the scientific accuracy of their test, that's the risk with holding a press conference. That's why most legal teams will tell you, go home, be quiet, rewrite right to remain silent, execute that. Show up at your hearing date, gets sworn in, say your piece, and then go ahead

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       about your life. How does John not have a trusted handler? How does John not have someone who realizes that you don't just have like a, a, a high level athlete? You have arguably the greatest light heavyweight of all time, who has not, in my opinion, reached its potential yet I think John has massive potential outside of what he's actually shown because when he moved to Albuquerque and we saw that he was training all the time and we saw the most recent footage before he fought over in St prue waste power lifting. He looks fucking huge. He's dedicated. His eating clean. He's making these instagram videos of all this healthy food he's eating. We're assuming he's getting the proper rest. All the other things we're assuming, get the wild man. Days are gone. He's still got the wild man's mind, but now he's gonna approach this like a real competitive athlete.

Speaker 1:          00:40:01       Here's my question to you. When someone is wild and talented and impulsive, just a wild motherfucker like Jon Jones is. Is it even smart terrain, that guy in Ken, how can it affect him? I mean, is it a positive thing to read them in or is part of what he is and why he's so good and why he's willing to open with a flying knee on a shogun was the first fight. The first fight for a title, what was he? Twenty three, 24, 20. He opens up with a flying knee on, you know, one of the legends of MMA, former pride champion or fry pride, a Grand Prix tramp champion and UFC champion as well. You'll, you'll look at a guy like John in the. The way he competes in the way he's. He's so creative and wild in there and impulsive. It's almost like that's a part of his success.

Speaker 2:          00:40:54       I fully agree. And historically I could bring up athletes where that is true or they go sober where they go straight and narrow when they find God, whatever these things are in, they changed something that yeah, the dominoes start to fall. The problem is when you've got a wild man like John, he's in a box and it's a loose box and he's having some fights, but usually that continues to escalate so he kinda needs to keep himself right in that framework. And the bad news is it usually just keeps get. It just usually just keeps pushing. So that's a very important. That becomes a problem. That's

Speaker 1:          00:41:25       a very important point where people escalate things like billionaires want more billions, right? They want islands now. They want fucking jets and spaceships and with

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       a pro athlete or a wild person who's doing crazy shit, they want to do more crazy shit. They want to drive 150 miles an hour. They want a man, but it just seems like whatever the fuck you do, nerf everything around him, you know, by up the town. Fucking have three guys that he trusts, followed him around everywhere and make sure that he doesn't eat anything that he's not supposed to eat. Don't take any pills you're not supposed to take. Don't. Most of us don't drive. I mean that was his biggest problem was getting behind the wheel in front of everything else he was doing was like, John, you gotta get you gotTa. Get a chauffer, you got to get uber. You can take a taxi. Don't get behind the wheel. That was the most of his problems. He had some other ones, but that was the most of it.

Speaker 4:          00:42:15       If you just took him out of the driver's seat. A lot of this doesn't exist. Yeah, a lot of it doesn't exist, but this most recent one obviously does and the like. Yeah. He had those. The two major car accidents, we had that beautiful Bentley and slid it into a tree and then obviously the one where he crashed and that woman and left the scene of the crime, which was horrendous. He survived that though. You know, he vibe that he came back and the urban st prue fight. He Won. They beat a top six guy on short notice and then this happens. And to get positive on something as small and innocuous as estrogen blockers. Yeah, I agree. So you go back to that open state approved fight, single worst performances of a performance of John's career, single worst by light years. They. You break it down a little further.

Speaker 4:          00:43:03       He won the grappling, he won the striking. He won every round. He did it. He did it back off. You didn't get tired. He was stronger. And that was on a bad day. I didn't think it was a bad fight. I, you know, everyone says the single worst performance. I have a great deal of respect for St prue and I think [inaudible] is a very dangerous guy. He's very explosive. His left power kick is extremely strong. He has a nasty left hook. He's a southpaw and he fights odd. He has a very odd style. I would agree about opens. I think your assessment there is fair and I think his stock went up that night, but when I'm watching John, I'm going, okay, this isn't that. This is a rusty John. This is slow or the outputs a little bit down. The bottom line is on a bad day, he left with a world championship on a bed.

Speaker 4:          00:43:45       That's how good he is. The other side of John, you know when you're talking about the car wrecks or one more time about the cocaine or what he's going through now, and again, this was my takeaway from the press conference. The biggest takeaway was John won't own anything and it's like John, at some point you can't do the routine about. I don't know why God put me in this spot. This is, I don't know why God put me in the spot. Everything happens for a reason. I'm going to come out better. On the other side, it's like John, you're acting like you got diagnosed with diabetes or cancer or something. You know that you're the victim. You weren't a hit and run. You did the hidden and you did the running. That was your fault on the cocaine thing. You didn't say, somebody slipped me a mickey.

Speaker 4:          00:44:20       You said I was at a party in Brazil, a rolled up 100 and went down to the tip. That was your fault. Now you're in a jam here for two banned substance in. You're still not taking response and you think God's put you in this spot. It's like John said, you put yourself in this spot and at some point if you're the baddest dude in the world and you are, you gotta man up on these things, you got to man up and go, Hey, I'm guilty and I how exactly it happened. I'm going to try to figure that out, but I'm definitely guilty of Sada does a good job. I trust those labs. Let's get to the bottom of the jail. Son In public relations is what we need. We need a need, a little earpiece. You put in John Jones ear, you sit behind the screens.

Speaker 4:          00:44:53       You have a monitor here you go. No, no, no, no, no. John, this is not. Just stop. Stop right there. But no more victim. No more victim role. You stand up like Tony Montana and that fucking restaurant. You're looking at the bad guy there. Say Hello. There it is through her bag guy. Yeah, I like to party. Bitch, I fucked up. I took some shit. What? So what supplements would have testosterone blockers or estrogen blockers excuse, but none that I've ever heard of. And again, but, but if you're there, but if they boost testosterone, estrogen blockers, apparently the is more of an effect of testosterone. How's it work? I've never heard that. No, that could be true. I think of myself as kind of an expert in this field from being on the wrong side, but on both sides of it. But, uh, I've never heard of that.

Speaker 4:          00:45:41       I can't imagine why supplement company would do that. And this supplement company wasn't like Tim means it's company or Yo El Ramirez, they came out with a press release instantly, so do not put this on us. Let us know what you need from us. We'll drop it off at the lab ourselves. Jamie, see if you find this online because someone told me about it this weekend and I never got a chance to look at. Someone said that there are certain things in supplements that you know could have been sold by a company that would allow you to test positive for these very things. See if. See if you could find that in, in relationship to John Jones is test because I remember someone talking about it and I said I gotta remember to look this up. What it's owned there. Only those two chemicals. The only exists like in a pharmaceutical world, right?

Speaker 4:          00:46:26       Yeah, that's right. So it's not like it's a root or something and you know. And then what exactly they got upon me that that's still coming out. But that was one of the things, again, to go back to the press conference and I think, I think John did more good than he did. I think it was kind of a good thing that he came out. He showed courage. He didn't read the script, he answered all the questions, but the bad was he didn't tell us what he tested positive for the bad news. Now we stuck with speculation. If he wouldn't come out and tell us exactly what it was, you and I wouldn't have to gas and go to the Internet and Springfield and speculate and rumors is which. Which you don't need. I don't know why he held that with understanding who god is going to tell us.

Speaker 4:          00:47:01       Tell us. I don't think they know. No, I don't. I really. I think if they're gonna charge him and they keep getting sued, have they're going to charge them and they are within the. Oh, that I'm going for breaking one year. Like medical information. You'll take it out of it's medical information. I suppose you're right with Hipaa, but this doesn't fall under that. The commission's going to bring charges against him for certain supplements. They're going to bring him in, require that he's there, they're going to have to address it. Then he's going to say his piece. Look, I took this. I didn't think I'd get caught or I don't know anything

Speaker 3:          00:47:29       about it. That's. That's a route. Guys go as well, but the bottom line is it's going to come out. I thought he had a good opportunity to tell us what it was and perhaps give a guess as to how it got an assistant. If he is going to take that path. The outright denial path. That's not a great one historically, but some guys taking, if that's the route, he's going to go to an outright denial. Tell us what it is. Oh yeah. Here we go. Go

Speaker 1:          00:47:51       a substance tests warning. Bodybuilders and other athletes objected to substance testing should never use this product unless first approved by the validating organization product may cause a drug test result called false positive urine or blood. What does. What is this stuff? Oh, is this the company that John Uses? Oh Shit, guys. Clean. Second. Second is taken to just keep the fucking guy. Oh my God. This is hilarious. When you go to this gap website and you know, I don't know what's in there. I don't know if this is a good company. I know nothing other than what I'm seeing right now. You're looking at a guy in their photos that's fucking clearly on steroids. Fucking clearly test digit. He's not testing. If that's it right there, Jack Guy, that massive mountain of muscle is not on steroids. Send me that shit. Send it to me. Box it up.

Speaker 1:          00:48:53       I'll fucking. I'll promote it for a month for free. If you can get that guy to look like that and test or test negative like that guy's not on Anna. Draw 50 and fucking tests. SIP, sip innate and every other fucking thing in the book and gorilla come and whatever the fuck he's on. That's a whole that you should not like. I hate to be the guy. Why? Why is the white guy so skinny in the background? Look at that photo again. I looked at Greg Jackson's brother a little bit. Doesn't mean what's that white guy doing in the background like that white guy has a skinny neck and you know, it was it kind of traps or he's flexing them but they're not really that impressive and he's in the back like looking at this black guy. This is like some cuckold type shit. That's what this is.

Speaker 1:          00:49:34       This black guy just doing curls and he's about to fuck the shit out of his girl and the other guy is like looking through the curtain like man, I don't even know what to do here. Like look at his face. He's not lifting. What is that guy doing in the back? He's got like minimal chest development. He looks Kinda scrawny. I would suspect you have something to do with the company or his father does a. that's generally how these things work out at the bizarre. That's a book that is, that's a bizarre choice. Like why is that distracting guy over that gentleman shoulder? Like one guy's looking at me like, fucking look, I'm good and boog got shoot is working good man. I'm getting big Bro on clean. I've got a dog tag on. Probably never been in the military, just sort of look to wear dog tags that are going to war. That's like a dog tag with like, it's like be dazzled. See it's got like tuning. Not I see has got legs on the outside edge of it. It's Kinda like a little fucking rhinestones and shit. It's a black dog tag too. It's not even a real dog tag is what? This is a weird fucking photo shoot.

Speaker 1:          00:50:40       I don't understand it. So there it is. So there are directions for tested testogenix let's, let's go to that directions. I want to find out what I'm supposed to do to get like that guy. Is this the company that John's. Whether this is just what we brought up. Oh, this is just the company on training and non training days. A dietary supplement take two to three tablets with breakfast and the other two to three tablets with lunch every day after six weeks of continual use. One month break is recommended. So it's a cycle. It's this test. Okay. Let's. What are the ingredients? Let's go all the way up. What do we got here? Hm. Vitamin E, vitamin B, six, magnesium, zinc, selenium, chromium tested gin, mass. Strength and size. Formula Three, b hydroxy five. And Dro Sten Sten Not Steve [inaudible]. Seventeen one. Okay, a three. One H indol three.

Speaker 1:          00:51:29       Okay. Yeah, these are tricky little things. Beta sit toll sterl from solely other vegetable oils. Okay. I don't know why I've told me that. Uh, I provide a bunch of bullshit after that. They always throw. I'll go wild. Yam Root Twenty five milligrams. That's nonsense. Wild yams or where they get testosterone from, they actually extract testosterone. They make it out of wild yams. So like when a company throws in like 25 milligrams of Wild Yam, what are you doing? Like you just trying to pretend that that's, that's significant. Your Wild Yam root. A lot of goofy stuff in here. Ginseng extract. Why do you have Jensen? Yeah. Well come on. He's not taking. What do you think? Challenge, jealous was waking up and taking this stuff. Why not? If it's. If it doesn't, if Beta alanine works, it's got 500 milligrams of Beta alanine. That stuff's legit.

Speaker 1:          00:52:21       I mean a mute me. How do you say it? Mucuna parenthesis, pure insists is extract that's been known to boost a human growth hormone, I believe, but I'm looking at all this stuff that he's doing. I might be wrong about that. I don't even know how to say that word. I don't even know if he was officially taking this particular supplement. I just, when I googled, uh, that company and just say this is the first one that came, of course, right? Yeah. So this is just by that company we don't know, but none of these things are estrogen blockers, so it doesn't make sense unless he got a tainted supplement, which again, and this is not the fault of the company, happens all the time because the way a supplement company works, like say if you wanted to buy a creatine or something from a company, you buy it in bulk from a supplier and that supplier, you might be in China or who knows where, and they mix these things up and they use the same Vat. Like that was the Anderson Silva Story. That was his alibi, was that he was buying liquid cialis and he was buying from a company that also sold steroids and apparently according to people that know him, that is actually what happened, which sounds crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:53:35       Very well. And he and he had three. He had three. He tests positive for three things. So maybe that knocks one off the list, but yeah, I hear you. There is some confusion there. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that story is bs, but I hear what you're saying. There is, there is confusion in there. Tim Means was innocent 100 percent. Yeah. And Yoel Romero. And they ruled that. That's not my opinion. They ruled the World

Speaker 1:          00:53:55       Ramiro. I mean, you want to talk about not passing the smell test. That guy is a goddamn freak of nature. I've never seen a guy he out of all the other freaks, he makes the other freaks look.

Speaker 3:          00:54:07       Sure. And Frank Mir appear. That's a, that's a weird one to even their own science. They're confused on Frank Mirs because there's metabolites were so low where they're going, what? Look, you passed here, you passed here, but you did it here. For your metabolites to be this low, you would have had to have taken it six weeks before, but we tested you. They're there. They are even confused on their science. They're, they've, they've admitted that they go at the shows up. We got to do something with it, but we don't. We don't understand how you had this reading and frankly I'll tell you everything I did. I'll tell you everything I ate. I don't. I don't know how this works. You give me the answer and they're even confused themselves. Go ahead. This, this shouldn't be. It is. We've got to deal with it, but it take the supplements, the test, the things that he's.

Speaker 3:          00:54:47       Frank hadn't taken any supplements. That was the other thing he said he fought in some, some different country. He goes, look, and everybody made fun of him for this, but he was just being honest, catering and he knows how he said that he now that the headlights made them look bad, but frank was just being Kennedy because look, the only thing I've done different. I was in this different country, some kangaroo meat for the first time. Everyone teased him, but he's going to ask me. They asked me, have you done anything different with the IOC is telling athletes we're food

Speaker 1:          00:55:12       in certain parts of the world in China and in Russia in particular to not eat the meat because if you eat the meat you could potentially test positive.

Speaker 3:          00:55:20       Right. Depending on when it came it. So frank offering them that was just, you know, he got teased for it, but he was just being candid. He might be right. Yeah. I mean he, he might've got some unscrupulous kangaroo meat. Yeah. And Frank's always been an open guy. He was on testosterone. He wasn't one of the guys that tried to hide it like the other guys. He went and asked for the tea. Frank. So a pretty straight up guy. He's an open book and it's not all great stuff. I mean, he'll tell you this. I'll tell you what frank says. I didn't. I tend, I believe him.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       Yeah, I do. I do as well. Yeah. He's just an. He has also a career of being straight up to start being deceptive now over something that doesn't really necessarily make sense, you know, after losing the Mark Hunt like that. This doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. Um, the testosterone thing, that is a, another thing that I feel like was medically very irresponsible the way they handled it and also that they didn't allow guys to take something like an estrogen blocker or something that Hcg or something that restarts your end to, consist of, but yet they allow these guys to fight and scheduled flights just a couple of months after getting off testosterone therapy. So you put these athletes in a very precarious situation where you're dangling this gigantic financial carrot in front of them. You know, you're saying, hey man, we got to fight. You know, you're going to make x amount of dollars is going to be awesome for you. But here's the kicker, no more testosterone, so all this stuff, it's been making you feel good and making your camps go better and allowing you to recover faster. That shit's out the door. So now you have to deal with not just your 37 year old endocrine system, which is fine, but a 37 year old and inconsistent and that needs to be restarted and you can't restart it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:59       Yeah, that's right. And, and, and they do put them in a tough spot too. And I would be curious if this was ever tested in a court because they put them in an interesting spot where a guy gets advice from his doctor, which you're supposed to listen to and he has to cross reference that advice with an athletic commission will time out a second. We're not talking about illegal drugs here. We're talking about legal medicine, FDA approved medicine that I'm taking appropriately and in conjunction with my physician and you're telling me I can't take it. And that even happens with the common cold flu and that they'll be in some of these silly things. And Anderson Silva, so he popped for that steroid, but two of the things he popped for were over the counter. One of them is a sleep aid that sits on the shelf next to Nyquil.

Speaker 2:          00:57:39       None of us knew was band until he got flagged for. Well, scratch our head guy. Maybe that's on the banned list. What is a sleep aid provide like as far as performance benefit? That's. So everybody likes to go back to that go. This doesn't help my performance. That's, it's not a performance test. It's not a steroids test. It's not a drugs test. It's a banned substance test. And that's where they go way out of bounds. Sometimes I think back to the, the, the Chinese gymnast where they stripped her metal, uh, in 2004 and kicked her out of the Olympics forever because she had a billionth of a trace of Ibuprofen which has a street name of advil. I'm going, this is silly, you know, this is silly. Good. Well, it's an antiinflammatory in that would help performance you go, that's a good thing to take some legal to take a legal thing that you've found that can help you.

Speaker 2:          00:58:22       Why would you take anything that could hurt you? That was another thing that John came out. He was so adamant that I took nothing to help my performance. I'm going, John, I don't know why that's the high canon of bad things you don't want to be associated with. You took coke, which is a felony and can kill you, but now you're standing on the moral high ground that you didn't take anything that could help you. That's just weird. That's weird. It's a weird way to phrase it. If you say, I didn't take anything that would help my performance than yc saying no. Say what the fuck you took and why you took it. Sure. Say what it is, but we only white Joe. Why would you take any of it's a supplement or anything else? Why would you take it if you didn't have a reasonable expectation that it helped your performance because you're not taking it for that. Then you're taking for the opposite. It has to be one of them.

Speaker 1:          00:59:06       What are you taking it for? Something else in life. Maybe you've taken it for anxiety maybe, but that doesn't make any sense with what he was taking it. But you know, I mean, look, Anderson was taking a liquid. Seattle's because he likes to party. I mean, why? Why do people take different

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       things that are not, that have nothing to do with athletic performance? They take it because there's a desired result. Um, but what I'm saying, if you're trying to fall into the scope of a medicine, well I can have an estrogen blocker would be, or testosterone. Those are classified as medicine and then maybe it can call it drugs all they want. That's medicine under the FDA. You can't become a medicine unless you can reasonably prove that it's going to help a patient. You can't be a doctor. Give somebody something that brings them down and makes them worse. That's malpractice. Well, here's what I'm saying is I know for while he denied that it would help his performance, like, well, of course you took it to make you feel, but whatever. I'm drinking coffee right now for the caffeine. That's just what it is. That that helps your performance and you were one of the first people to tell me that there's a very specific amount of caffeine that you're allowed to have, so you would take an for them.

Speaker 4:          01:00:07       You wouldn't trust a cup of coffee, right? Well, yes, that's true. That is true, but I just think that's ridiculous. One to. They say that to now. You'd have to be tested your bodies to all these different things, but they say that two cups of coffee in a 15 minute period will make you test hot. Now you'll only test taught for about 15 minutes because caffeine wears off so fast, but yes, if somebody was to come in right now I've got three different coffees in front of me. I could be above the limit on that. I'm sitting here going, Oh, I'm getting jazzed up to do a podcast. I'm not sure that that. I'm not sure that that relates, but the rules are the rules. I'd be cheating, but is that out of competition since it has such a short life, like if you came in here is because when John tested positive for cocaine against Daniel, it was three weeks out, so it was out of competition.

Speaker 4:          01:00:51       So it wasn't like he was fighting coked up. Right? That's right. And there is two different sets of standards there. Uh, and caffeine gotTa, if you're out of competition, you must be fine. Advils and you know, we talked about advil or there is some that are only band in competition. There are a lot out of competition and then there's some no nos forever, but that's where it starts to get confusing. And then the way they've handled it is to go, it's on the athlete. He was like, well, okay, fair enough. But athletes, particularly, fighters are the lowest form of society. You're the government. You can't just put it on the athletes. It's got to be your, the government. You're operating on the taxpayer's dollar. You've got offices, you're making the rule. You take some responsibility to. Yeah, no, I agree. I agree. And I think especially when you're talking about a medical issue like this testosterone therapy issue, I mean it's worked itself out.

Speaker 4:          01:01:38       That does, did settle in time. They allowed it to just play itself out, but I think a lot of guys got fucked over and I, I hate to, um, be a Vituro apologist. Uh, but because I've been such a, I was such a fan of trt. Veto loved him. Oh my God. And we all did. It was such a free is great. When he, when he fought bisping and rockhold he's, we'll kick in people and don't be t RTV tour was fucking terrifying. But vituro when he fought Weidman, I remember feeling when he went into the octagon and I saw him bouncing around and it's loose, skin was moving all over. His body is like, wow, this guy's fucked. Yeah, like his body is fucked. This is not a regular 37 year old guy who was in shape who hasn't taken anything. No,

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       this is a fucking world championship caliber pro athlete whose bodies been just compromised, massively compromised. So, I mean, he's rebounded. He looked much better now, but God damn you look terrible

Speaker 2:          01:02:32       and acg is so important for any doctor will tell you. If you go on testosterone, you've got it. Then go on Hcg. You got to turn that, turn that back on. He didn't have that benefit. The rules came in. He had two different flags and he just wasn't ready to go down that path, so he literally stopped everything cold Turkey opposite of the advice of his doctrine. I've never asked him about the. I just know his doctor would have said, look, this is what you need, and he goes, I'm out. There's no room for error here. They've changed the rules. I'm out

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       as crazy as they. That could affect them longterm, Joe. It, it certainly can, and certainly the beating that he took could affect them longterm and the beating. There's a big factor of having incredibly low testosterone and we have very low testosterone. When he went into that fight there, there would be a possibility. I actually see that's not true. I should. I should recant that because Weidman got in his face at the way in and was saying you took because he tested at 1200 and Weidman tested it three and he was like, what the fuck is going on? How do you have four times as much testosterone is me and I talked to Novitsky about. I was trying. I was like, please explain to a moron like me, what the fuck is going on? And they were saying, well, it's, it's dependent, it's time dependent. It's how much available testosterone to it.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       Like when did they test him? Was He recovering from sleep? Was he at its peak? There was. Did he had he done explosive athletics like squats or deadlifts very recently, and then recovered his testosterone ramp back up. Did they catch Weidman after Weidman had a grueling workout and his testosterone was down? Right. There's a lot of factors apparently that, that play into that and Weidman and he even said himself, he said, look, I, I kind of have low testosterone while this. While TRT was illegal. He's like, I could qualify for it. I can go in and qualify for it.

Speaker 2:          01:04:14       Yeah, I remember that very well, but dev toward did not have any, uh, he did not have testosterone. He did his level was high and all of that, but he didn't have any endogenous testosterone in him. He had no supplement whatsoever, so that was a little bit misunderstood. And then also thank you very much. And then also to his po or to your point Weidman, when he was tested, if he would have been tested in the morning, it would have been down a if he would've just had a hard workout and chewed up a lot of the test, it would have been done. So that was a little confusing. [inaudible] hands were clean there and Chris was misunderstanding what he was reading and let loose on him. And Chris had every right to assume that [inaudible] was still trying to slip that through. That was the better part of his career. But in fairness, he wasn't. When Vitorin goes, hey, I'm out. He really, he, he was out and they tested the hell out of Itar. He's passed them off. Victoria went straight.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       Yeah, he had to. And his body really showed it. Yeah. Well, when did he fought Henderson, the, uh, the third Henderson fight in Brazil. Uh, he looked like he was gaining is muscle mass back. You looked it looked a little bit better, but he's just, he just does not look like trt Vittorio. Physically. He's the guy that's had the, the, the biggest difference. And I just, I feel like if you're going to just say you have to be off of it, I think is ridiculous. I think, I mean he wanted that title shot and is really important to him, but I feel like that medically they had a responsibility to give the guy a break, like to say we're going to give you six months of, of restorative therapy and they'll allow your body to come back into a normal testosterone range and then reenter into the drug testing, you know, and we'll test you during that time to make sure that you're not taking anything else on top of that. But to not allow the guy any sort of medicine that can restart his endocrine system seems very irresponsible when it's such a primary factor in performance in. You're not talking about like fucking volleyball, you're talking about head kicks, you know, and the difference between getting beat up and not getting beat up there between getting brain damage and not getting brain damage could. That could play a huge factor in there. Right?

Speaker 2:          01:06:25       Yeah. And I think in hindsight, I think the commission would have handled it different. They've kind of even said that, hey, we pulled the rug out here and they went as close to taking some, some of the responsibilities you could without taking it. And the other side was fighters. We should've been able to myself, we should have been, was just go time, time out. I can't comply, but I want to be in compliance, but I can't right now. I've taken my oars out of the water. I'm going to go do my. Leave me out of it. Don't test me. I'll tell you right now. It's not. Give me six months. To your point, you'd almost have to retire, but none of us knew. None of us. None of us knew what we didn't know. Like with Vandelay, when the guy showed up, when the guy came to me and I'm in the closet with none of us knew what was going on.

Speaker 2:          01:07:01       It's kind of a different world now. You have to have that education process. Whatever John's going through with Tim means, what frame this is, how we learn, you know, we learned from guys stumbling and stubbing their toe. They just don't give a big allowance for that. It's pretty black and white on these rules. John's going to be out for two years. I keep hearing things speculative on how long it's going to be real clear as it's going to be off for two years. That's the minimum. If he testified he's out for two years. That's just what it is. Well, Anderson wasn't now for two years. What was the person? Uh, Anderson beat the clock on the mandatory how long you're out. He came in just before that. Hector lumbar came in just before that. So those guys weren't subject to that. Anderson got, they could have done whatever they want for it. To him, the standard was nine to 12 months. He probably would have got nine, but he denied it to the event, the hate that he shows up. All of a sudden he doesn't speak English. They hate that they were still pretty light on him though for three substances and a guy that still a was resisting the test and coming in with the store and refusing to talk to him 12 months that they were pretty reasonable by their standards,

Speaker 1:          01:08:04       by their standard. What do you think is a reasonable suspension? If a guy does get popped for estrogen blockers and he says, Hey, I fucked up. I want an edge. I took it. What's a reasonable amount of suspension? What?

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       My answer will be different because you said for estrogen blockers, again, he's blocking something. He's not adding something. He's blocking something. Now they come back in with their intellectual approach to go where you're only blocking it because you did something before. We didn't catch it before, so we're going to get you now. Not a terrible argument, but if you just look at what he did, I think that. I think there needs to be some conversation there. I was there in front of the Commission One day I got approved for a steroid for testosterone. That same day, Nick Diaz took $100,000 fine and lost his license for a year for pot of which he had illegal medication for Blah Blah. You know the story on that, so you never know what's going to happen when you get in there. You never know what's going to happen. It's not a courtroom. Media likes to say he's gonna have his day in court. Well that's the. You don't have a day in court. Court implies a judge which implies a disinterested third party. You're going in front of the people who have accused you, so if they clear you there, now admitting they got it wrong to start with, that's literally never happened. They have never been wrong where they go, hey, we have this wrong. Go on about your day. It's never happened.

Speaker 1:          01:09:17       Is vandelay the first guy to sue the athletic commission and when.

Speaker 2:          01:09:21       Okay, was he the for? I can't think of anyone else, but I'd have to look. You know, Nick Diaz did the same thing and they finally said, okay, he'll look, let's settle,

Speaker 1:          01:09:28       but I think with Nick Diaz, they made a compromise and they, they, they abandoned for five years for pot and the world went crazy and I gave out the fucking Nevada state athletic commission, his phone number. I was like, call him up, tell him it's sucks. Sure. And the whole world went crazy. Internet was, they were making petitions and everybody was emailing and writing people. People were like justifiably outraged, but that, that was a little bit different. They reduced his sentence and the vandelay thing was interesting because it seemed like a judge outside of the commission made the call.

Speaker 2:          01:09:58       That is who did it and it was really weird because they came in with two things. First off, can you banned him for life? And second, did you have jurisdiction over? Now if you read the statute, you don't have to be a lawyer. The statute is very small and it's extremely clear. They did not have jurisdiction over him. At the same time, they can do anything they want so they could banned him for life. You get in front of the judge, the judge rule, just the opposite. You can't ban him for life. That's too extreme, which is not true for the statute. They can do that that historically they have, but they can. They did not have the right to test him though because he was not licensed yet in Nevada and the statute clearly says to the licensee of which he was not kaiser who was in at the time said, listen, the fights been announced in my state. He's in my state. That gives me the right. Well, the judge agreed with him that judge got it just backwards, but when they did it, when they didn't realize, when the judge did not rule on how long the suspension would be, he sent him back to Nevada. He still hasn't got that result. So for everyday they kicked the can down the road. They when he's still suspended, so he got his release from the UFC. He can go fight in another state he wants right now.

Speaker 1:          01:11:05       Well, he's preparing to fight fader, right? Isn't that a fight that they were trying to make for reason?

Speaker 2:          01:11:10       Not that I know of. I heard, I heard a rumor that he would get to that eventually,

Speaker 4:          01:11:14       but vandelays got some kind of wrestling thing lined up for like a tag team. Wrestling matches how it's going to ease his way back in the pool. He just killed it. Got Hit by a car. I read this. These. Okay. Fortunately, yeah. Well I thought I thought he had shoulder surgery. He could have. Could have. I heard it hasn't the latest competition. Okay. Yeah. Well I had heard that he was going to be fighting. See if you can find that. I heard that he was going to be fighting fate or in, in Japan and you know, the doorman seeing his fight with Maldonado was like, wow, how far the mighty have fallen. He does not look the same at all. Fatigue's a son of a gun too, man. When you get tired it doesn't. It doesn't matter how good you are. It doesn't matter what you did before.

Speaker 4:          01:11:53       If you get tired, you got problems. Now the good news for him is Maldonado got tired too. Yeah. Momo has never been a guy that's been the most conditioned guy in the world, but he is a guy with fantastic boxing, very good boxing, and he caught fade or with a couple of good shots and had them really badly hurt. Yeah. A lot of people think that fight could have been stopped. I mean under a bad judge. I don't think it should have been stopped, but under a bad referee it could have been or referee. That was a little too quick to pull the trigger or if it wasn't in Russia for one. Yeah, there were. There was definitely some politics there and I felt bad for Maldonado Maldonado thought he was going to get a fair shake and I'm looking at it going, well, no, I'm.

Speaker 4:          01:12:26       Although it makes sure you get a good paycheck because you're not getting a fair shake in Russia. And then he even filed a complaint after the fact that petition and he felt too. It's like Malden, well maybe you don't know how this works over there, but that it's over. It's over. I mean unless he flat lined them, he wasn't winning. Who would've had to have knocked him out and I'm sure whatever referee at the time would be very hesitant to stop that fight with. Even with theater, getting his brains beat. Sure. If he thought he could make it to the bell and the real controversy, it was that first round that you're talking about with the ref could have stopped. It probably should have. It wasn't a 10, eight round and it's like, look, if that's not a 10, eight round that what is in that fight?

Speaker 4:          01:13:03       Should have been a dry. It was. It was one round, but it was 10, eight, two, two rounds for fader. A lot of people argue rounds two and three, but they're. They're wrong. Fader one those rounds. Maybe they are, but he want them. They should have been a drop. Yeah, he. Him Not being in the UFC during his prime is one of the great tragedies of MMA. I really, really feel that I would have loved to seen the fate or that fought cro, cop fight in the UFC and I think he would have been heavyweight champion. I really do. I think he. The only argument against him being the greatest of all time, in my opinion, is Cain Velasquez and I guess you could kind of make it for overdue, but I think for doing that got knocked out by Steve Bay was a healthy Verdugo. He just got emotional and crazy and he charged after Steve Bay and steep based that fucking good.

Speaker 4:          01:13:44       Yeah, he is. He's really good. I mean Steve Bay is a bad motherfucker. It was no doubt about it. He's a deserving world champion, but man, I'm just. I would've loved to seen primetime cane versus primetime fatal. Sure. I'd love to say to you and I maintained that Cain is the most intimidating figure in the heavyweight division that even though he's jerking the curtain on Saturday night for the, for the biggest card ever, he is the most intimidating guy in the back. He's a jerk in the curtain jerk and the curtain is the guy that starts the show. You've got to pull the curtain out of the way to start the show that every started as he started on Saturday night. Right. You got the heavy, the former heavyweight champion who's headlining cards and had bills with his name on the top of. Now a sudden he's jerking the curtain because it's UFC 200.

Speaker 4:          01:14:25       That's what I'm saying. It was the biggest car there was, you know, performance. He had great performance. Travis Browne is nobody's fool. No. Travis Browne is ranked number four in the world, was ranked number three and he should be one of the. Travis caught him clean straight right hand at first round. One of the few guys to beat Josh Barnett and Travis is a good heavy weight. You need to be a basketball player. You talked about steep a minute ago. Steve plays a good athlete and we don't have a ton of them. You know, some of the great athletes that are that size. They go into some other professions. You don't usually get them in this one. Steve Bay's a good looking heavyweight. He moves well. He works hard. He's got the wrestling background, played baseball. He's just a good guy, man. Yeah. He really. What? What came brings to the table is some freak cardio and perfect technique.

Speaker 4:          01:15:06       I mean, he's just, he's so unusual in his cardio. We'll kick incredible, crazy through two of them receive a try in that. So we're good on that. Javier, pull them aside. He goes, Hey, can we can start working on Wilcox? I don't know what it was saying, but they were good. There was beautiful. There was nothing wrong with them. I mean, some guy when Weidman through that we'll kick against rockhold you like blah blah, blah, blah. What the fuck are you doing? And then he gets taken down. Chris. Why? And it wasn't a good. We'll kick. It was goofy. We'll kick. Yeah. It just didn't look right, but when you saw throw, throw, you're like, oh that's perfect. Yeah. But that's, that's how he executes. Punches, kicks, takedowns. Everything is perfect. There's no wind up. Nothing. Nothing has like extra horsepower behind it. Everything's precise.

Speaker 4:          01:15:48       He's one of my favorite all time guys to watch because of that. Yeah, I agree with that. And that's your porn on for June. So for doing beats fader who might be the. Great. So you say you don't know who the greatest ever was. It was it, was it a fader or was it cane? Verdugo. Unbeatable for doom. Doesn't end up in the conversation. It's one of those does things. He does. I think he does, but you know, I mean because you got to think the Prime Verducci who beat feet or the prime for doom that beat cain could probably have beaten those guys no matter where. It's very possible he could have beaten those guys no matter what. So I think he does go into the conversation. It's just the history, that cane hat and the history that fade or had mean canes, insane wars and the way broke down junior dos Santos, it gets knocked out in the first fight and then the next two fights just puts off fucking helacious beating on him.

Speaker 4:          01:16:34       Right. I think points, you know, the MMA, math sucks. Sure. We, you just, it's real hard to say this guy, be that guy. So He's number one and that guy beat this guy. So. And when you talk about it, what are the elements that comes in is that the guys wins and losses and his skills. It's also an intimidation factor right? What kind of intimidation they have, what we're doing know, mix the joker face, and he's always teasing around so he gets overlooked, but I don't think that's fair. You know, the same thing's happening to bisping. Weidman comes out, he says, bisping's the most undeserving person of all time to end up at a title spot, and I'm going to time timeout and Christmas a start. But Chris Timeout. You become famous

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       and world champion by beating Anderson Silva. Bisping just beat the same guy that you beat. Bisbing just beat the same guy that puts yourself over. Why does it not put bisbing over? Now? He just beats rockhold who beat you. And but bisping still not over. Now. It's kind of a weird thing.

Speaker 1:          01:17:25       Not only does it put bisping over, but bisping beat rockhold. When rockhold was fighting, he wasn't clowning around. When when Chris beat Anderson, he beat him twice. He beat him once. When Anderson dropped, his hands was being silly and he got cracked and everybody was like, I can't believe Anderson did that. It was, it was a terrible way to lose. It wasn't just that they were going to exchange and Chris landed a bomb of a left hook. No, it was anderson was pretending to be hurt and then he was like faking wobbling and trying to duck out of the way of punches like he always does and Chris cracked him. Then the second fight, he breaks his leg and he throws, throws a Kyc, checks it and breaks late. Granted Chris beat the shit out of them the first round and almost like head. I'm in bad trouble in that first round. Controlled them on the ground, beat him up. So they go into the second round. He breaks his leg and the second part. So those are more freakish. Sure. Then what bisping debt, what bisbing did is just straight up, he fucking landed a beautiful left hook, heard them moved in for the kill, closed the show, legit champion. One hundred percent. No controversy.

Speaker 2:          01:18:28       I've tried fully agree with that and I love this next match up. You know, you heard it's going to be Dan Henderson and that doesn't go in the rankings. I get all of that, but you know, I liked the UFC when they make the matches that people want to see and that's an interesting match. If you think, if you think this is going to just go in and beat him or you look at dance record, you think that bisping doesn't go to bed at night. Remember on what that was like? The teasing, the highlight reel, all the people to everybody telling them about, you know, making fun of him flying through the air when he pounded bisbing just to hit. It was more conscious. Yeah, that's his logo. Yeah. I mean this is highlight reel, knockout. I stayed at Dan Henderson's house for a month, helping them train for [inaudible] and when you turn dance tv off at night, the remote control says lights out and it's him hitting bisping lights up.

Speaker 2:          01:19:10       That's what lights up on his remote control. So I mean he doesn't have confidence going into the shittiest competence. He knows he could beat him. He already did. If you think bespeaks not going, man, I really don't want to be in there with that guy again. He's going to say, I want that one back and one, he's going to say all those things and try to convince himself, but the bottom line is that's relevant. Dan Henderson will be the world champion. It's very possible, very possible. Look. He just knocked Hector Lombard dead. Hector's tougher and health tech. There's never been given the credit that he deserved a monster. Monster fights it two different ways. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:19:40       Nicholas Power and he had Dan hirt and Dan had hit her. He, Dan hurt him first. Hector came back, hurt Dan. Dan recovered and knocked him out with a crazy fucking elbow and then another shot when once he moves basically out from that back elbow, but it shows that Dan can still shut the lights out on a guy in his prime who's a destroyer, who's never been knocked out before in the aunt.

Speaker 2:          01:20:04       I fully agree. Disagree. There's one of those guys of what happens

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       to them and hector stubbed his toe a few times. You want to see hector fight. Hector's got the whole thing. He's going to do the promos before and he's going to mean it. He's going to hate that opponent. It's real, he's going to look like a million bucks and he's going to come out fight and whatever happens after that happens, but he's coming to fight when he went out on his shield. Um, and when you look at this fight between bisping and Henderson, that's the most exciting fight. I mean, that's why I liked the fact that the UFC made it. That's the fight that I wanted to see. I put it on my instagram. I'm like, come, yes, please, please, let's make it happen. Let's do it. Yeah. That's the fight. And if Dan goes out, Dan came to my, uh, I, his fight was on a Saturday.

Speaker 4:          01:20:41       He came to my show at the Ice House in Pasadena on Wednesday. He said he had been drunk since Saturday. That sounds great. He was so happy. And I'm like, well, what do you think? Is it possible? And like, we're trying, we're trying to make that happen. Like the bisping fight. I'm like, that is the fight to make. And I go, would you retire if, if that would, if you went out with that, fine. He goes, yeah, he goes as the only fight I want right now. It goes, I don't even really want to fight anybody else. I want to fight him, and then I think I'm done now. What about what George St Pierre was saying he would come back and he wanted bisping and if George comes to the table and says, I'll come back, but only if. Well then it's only if you're doing it, you're doing that.

Speaker 4:          01:21:20       That's a big fight. If he comes back and fights bisping. I don't know if it's a bigger fight than Henderson. I agree that it doesn't sell more, but I'm saying if that's what you gotta do to get George back to the table, I think. I think you do it. Don't if you're Dana, don't you do. Okay. You don't think that's what you need to do. I think he's just saying that because it's an attractive option because you know bisping has the title. It's an interesting fight. He wouldn't have to cut weight. Mean literally. He's walking around at one 86. This is a much larger. Got Larger. You think that Dana told George? No, no, I don't want to do that match. No, I just think they probably didn't. Didn't really have it worked out. They were probably discussing it and trying to figure out what the details would be, but if you look at the most attractive fight to Bisping, I would think the Henderson fight would be because Dan doesn't have much time left.

Speaker 4:          01:22:03       If he misses them this time around, he might not ever be able to fight them again. This being legitimately wants to get revenge and he's the world champion now. It's his call, so Kudos to him for taking this fight for saying, you know what man, this guy just blew. It's not like. It's not like he called them out right after. He just got knocked out in the first round by [inaudible] know you called them out after you just destroyed Hector Lombard and like that was one of the greatest knockouts in the history of the sport. I mean when that happened, because when you consider all that was at stake when you consider that Dan was 45 years old, that people thought he was in the twilight of his career. That he's stepping in there to fight hector. Lumbar was just a fucking monster in his prime. Like that was a great knockout. An all time great result. So Kudos to bisping. Kudos to bisping for wanting that fight now and the way bisping needs to handle it. When you factor Shaka Ryan, who's going, hey, wait a minute, I have beaten you. I got the skills to beat you on the number one contender. Here's how bisping we'll handle it. No, you're not. Wait your. That's how they'll handle

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       the way to shut those guys down. Joe. It's to go back to the truth, the truth, your friend. Listen, Jacques Rey, you're more dangerous. You're more likely to beat me and I'm not looking to get beat, so I'm going to go deal with this guy. It shuts everything. A bisbing won't do it. Everybody likes to go, well wait your turn and this and then you're not as good as you think you are. Go fight your over America. Whatever it is, steer right into it. Yeah man, you're way more like, here's what I want to do. I want to fight the easiest guy in the biggest stadium for the largest paycheck and that's what I'm going to politic to do. So you do your thing and I'm going to do mine. Well, the Socceroos, is that right? Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:23:36       Not very good for JOC ray, because he lost the fight with your Ramiro. I for some reason. Erroneous. Yeah. I had an erroneous memory of jock or a winning the decision. I don't know why. Maybe it's because of him testing positive, but it was a very close fight too. I remember not knowing after it was over. I mean I remember you well blasted them and had them really badly hurt, but I felt like Zachary came back a bit and it was a very close fight towards the end, but it's very tough. I agree with the decision popped, but I can see it. It was tight. Jacques raised. He's fantastic. They're both fantastic. Yeah, they really are. And when he. When he lost that fight though, it's real hard to lose a fight. Even if a guy that popped for a tainted supplement that mean they only give them a six month suspension, it's real hard to make an argument that you deserve the next shot at the title. I think that actually solidifies dance

Speaker 3:          01:24:25       position. Sure. I agree with you. Can I switch gears? Yeah. I got to ask you about. You asked me about anything. Joey Diaz. Tell me everything. How did you meet Joe des [inaudible] [inaudible]. Then I want you to ask me this. I want you to ask me what my experience with joy, but how did you meet him? How did he come into the fold?

Speaker 1:          01:24:41       I met Joey Diaz in the late nineties, uh, at the comedy store. I think I met him in like [inaudible] 96 or 97, something like that. Uh, right when Joey moved to La, we just started hanging around the comedy store. We became friends and then I started taking on the road with me. Like, uh, the late nineties. We've been best friends forever,

Speaker 3:          01:25:01       so I know of Joey. I don't know Joey. I've never met him. Never met Joe. Whenever I call him up right now, TV and the whole bit and you know, I know him from, from you and I see your podcast and all that, but. And he's in the circles. He does some Jujitsu, he's funnier than hell and he's a gangster. So I like him, but I don't know anything about him. So he comes on my podcast now he has a podcast, so of course my opening line to them as, hey, how'd you get into pocket? Right? I'm going to put here, here's your plug for your podcast and we're going to go on and talk about my agenda. So I say, Joe, I say to him, Joey, how'd you get into podcasting? And his response, you know Chael Sonnen, he wouldn't call me jail. It was always. She calls me Joe Rogan. I'm mugged a hooker down in New Jersey and senator Lee said her wig on fire.

Speaker 3:          01:25:47       It's okay. We got to. There's two moving parts here. First off, that is, I don't know how that answers my question of how, but now I need to know the story here. So we ties it all together with. He went on something, just something, he got an appearance. He told the story of mugging her a hooker in New Jersey and setting her wig on fire and all of a sudden he blew up overnight and he goes, yeah. I realized people like the stores. I never knew that I had stories from the part of the country. I'm in the neighborhood I grew up in. I thought everybody had these doors. He's like, chill son. And I thought I'd tell you I mogul hooker and lighter wig on fire. You Go, yeah, well I'm up 10 hookers and let 10 wigs on fire. I was like, I didn't know I had stories and then it just goes from there.

Speaker 3:          01:26:23       And he starts telling me about. So He. So he, he ends up doing two years or 18 months and I said, well, what kind of jam did you get in there? And he said, well, I was actually, I was doing the cop's job for them. You know, the cops don't want drugs on the streets. I went, took two kilos off the streets form. This is how he presents it to me. He goes, yeah, you know, the, the, the two kilos wasn't as big of a deal. Oh. He said, Oh, I, I robbed two kilos. He goes, and you know what else? Chael Sonnen, I just happened to have a machine gun and I go, I can see where that happened because she is sometimes you just back into a machine gun. I had a machine gun with me and he goes, but it's funny. I wasn't in trouble for the gun.

Speaker 3:          01:26:58       I really wasn't that much trouble for the drugs. What they were upset about was the kidnapping. I'm going, okay, what, what happened here? This is my intro to the guy. I'm like, what? What in the hell is this story? You probably know the story, but I did it. So he tells me the whole story. He says, yeah, but you know, kidnappings, kind of a weird charge. He goes, when you and vandelay gotten that scuffle in the ultimate fighter, if I come and grab you and take you into the next room just to cool you down, taking you into a room against your will, that's kidnapping. So I think like they got him on a technicality jam, like what they're doing with Frank Mir. Some of these guys were talking about and I said, okay, is that what happened? And he goes, no, I duct taped the game.

Speaker 3:          01:27:33       He's in my trunk. And then I held him in the house for a week before I let him go. Well then why didn't you tell me? Why did you bring up the initial example of taking me next door and cooling me debt? What that have to do? I still don't know because he's crazy. It's funnier than hell. And I asked. So I was trying to talk like some. See I try to do more of a Joe Rogan experience. You're, you're my idol. I try to do my show the way you do yours, but I'm not there yet. It takes a while to build that audience. So I got a stick on MMA and pro wrestling. I got to really stay in, but I don't want that. I want just. I want to just talk. You could just talk. You. You definitely could just talk was I bring these guys in.

Speaker 3:          01:28:07       I'm trying to do a little more that I go to Tmz, I see the local stuff, I try to ask them pop culture questions. So I dip my toe in politics with Joey Obama had just made this new rule of going to the bathroom you want. So I asked Joey about that and he goes, chill son. And I've been taking a dump in the woman's bathroom since I'm five years old and believe me, I have dealt with the consequences, but he wasn't kidding Joe. That's what's made this. It's a shoot. He's being real. And he tells me he is pro wrestling. He goes, well, my mom used to own a restaurant so you know, I kinda had. I cleaned the bag and then I sit down in the women's. He goes, you know what happens if you drop, you drop your coke on a men's bathroom floor.

Speaker 3:          01:28:47       No, I don't know. I don't do like, I've tested positive for everything in the world, but coke was at one of them. I used. Since you leave it there, you know what happens if I drop my coconut, a women's bathroom floor, you'd get down and lick it up. That's what he. He says, everybody's trying to say the women's rooms cleaning he'd been used up, says he's five years old and he said, and I have dealt with the consequences, which I knew I want the answer to what those were. It's just, it's like there's too many other things to talk to this guy, but I got to get back to the hooker with the wig that he mugged. I've known Joe. He was busy

Speaker 1:          01:29:17       20 years and he's never stopped running out of stories and they're all real people. His wife is so fucking crazy that people go, oh, that guy just comes on your show and make stuff up. That's what people used to say when I used to have them on these to say like when we first started doing the podcasts that I'm tired of that Joey Diaz Guy. He's lying. He's just making things up. Haters would say that, but then people would come on his show and substantiate. He would call people up in New Jersey that he grew up with. They would tell. He would go, Tom, that fucking story about the time we lit the whole [inaudible] word on fire and then they would tell the same story like he's lived a movie, not a movie, like an epic adventure series of novels. I kids life is insane.

Speaker 3:          01:30:00       Well, to qualify. So he tells this story about Robin, this guy with a machine gun that he just happened to have taken the two kilos off the street during the cop's job for him, but then having the guy in his trunk duct tape before I moved into the house before I let him go. He had that guy on his podcast. Yes. He found him on social media, tried to friend him or like him or whatever you call it, on faith. I'm a twitter guy, but this was facebook guy ignored him for about two years. Finally responded. Now Joey's had them on his pockets. He says, we catch up about once a month and he goes, yeah, and the guy was good people. He never turned me in. He said it was yet, it was my partner in the whole thing. The partner try to double cross me and we stole the coke.

Speaker 3:          01:30:34       Then he was going to steal it from me, but I knew what time it was. That's an expression I'd never heard before, but I plan to take with me through my next years in life, whenever. Wherever you go. I knew what time it was. I just thought that was a great line. The whole thing was I asked him about the gorilla. The gorilla had just got shot where they killed him at the zoo and he says, you know what? Chill Center. They don't give us the good gorillas. I'm. I'm down at the zoo last week, the gorillas, they got their hair messed up. They don't eat bananas. They want chicken cutlets. Shoot the FN gorilla. It's like you had no idea was going to ask you that. That was so spontaneously funny. You know that news had just broken, right? Then I was like, this is the guy. This is a funny guy.

Speaker 1:          01:31:14       No, he's unbelievable. He's the funniest person I've ever met in my life. He's the funniest comedian I've ever seen in my life. Well, I've seen them live or you got to see him live with. How long have you.

Speaker 3:          01:31:23       I'm here until tomorrow. I'm gonna do fighter and the kid I got to see. Speaking of Qa, I got to see Adam Hunter last night live and he lit it up. Adam Hunter was very funny. He was very funny. He's very good. He's really good writer. He worked the whole crowd in he. He made it a thing. Any any sold the venue out is his real intimate atmosphere at stratos for I would guess 100 seats. A very small, but it was packed. That's perfect. Went right around the room. I mean he rose. There's nothing off limits. Women's jokes, gay jokes, racial jokes, everything, and it was awesome and possibly as funny. It's like who's going around to couple. Hey, how'd you guys meet? Hey, how'd you guys meet? You know, where'd you guys meet Jimmy at the UFC? You guys fight phase during the whole thing there. A nerdy coupling.

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       [inaudible]. Where'd you guys meet? Lenscrafters. It's right. See, brilliance is in it's simplicity. You can use that line in school and not even get a detention. I mean, that's a, that's a powerful and funny line. And the teacher can even send you to the office for me. Right? It's not me, it's just bloody now. He's a funny dude. He's, he's, I got in trouble for quoting one of his jokes during a fox broadcast, like a Fox sports one. Who was the fighter that he was telling a joke about? Um, he said he comes from behind more than Lance Bass. Yes. Who Was it? Can't remember. But that was a funny line. Yes. You use like a paper view though, or. I think it was, it was on fs one that was part of the problem. Okay. It works. Martin Kampmann. Yeah, it was Martin Cameron and uh, I just wanted to credit him because it made me laugh so hard.

Speaker 4:          01:32:52       That's why I said as my friend Adam Hunter, so I kind of got away with it because it wasn't. My joke is if I had said it, sure. Well here, if we're playing, if we're playing that game, I can't tell one, but if I quote him, maybe I can't. He sends me a text after the Orlando shooting the very next day. He says, Hey man, let me know you're okay. I heard there was a shooting at a gay club. I just want to check on you. It's like, now you got to do that in private. You can do anything. They want this loophole. It's hilarious. I'm just reading that shit. That's funny. I wonder how many other people you said that too, but the right mark for that because that's funny. That's funny. It is funny. Well, that's a weird position. I believe in the rule, Joe.

Speaker 4:          01:33:28       If it's funny then you can do it. Yes. Yeah. Well both. Funny. Subjective, right? Like what's funded you? Other people might get offended and that's one of the things that people who love to be recreationally outrage. That's what they do. They'll find a joke and they'll say, that's not funny to me. It's horribly offensive and it's degrading and blah blah, and they'll come up with a bunch of reasons why. It shouldn't be funny, but if there's someone out there that's howling at the same time, you're protesting the other person's howling laughing, then it did its job for you, for me. You sent out a great tweet. You might. It might've been as recently as yesterday, but the for it was a two part. The first part said this country does. This country has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem and this country has a tyranny problem disguised as a security problem.

Speaker 4:          01:34:14       It's a security problem and it went crazy. Twitter lit up and when I'm reading that I'm going, okay, Joe's dip it in something here. Joe Doesn't usually dip in, but he's right. There was no way to say that that statement is not right and it wasn't meant to be funny. That was a very true and I thought a powerful statement by you. Thank you. It's actually a couple of years old. It's just a, it's just going around a lot. People who are retweeting it. Okay. Came back, but it's um, there's no way you can't call what happened in Orlando, a mental health problem. There's plenty of guns. There are more guns than there are human beings in this country, and if there was a gun problem, the way a lot of people like to pretend there's a gun problem or the way they like to, I shouldn't say pretend because obviously there's an issue. Um, the way they like to categorize it.

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       There would be people shooting people in mass all day long. Every day. It would be impossible to go out of the house without looking for gunfire. That's not the case. Will you think about how many people are there are and how many guns there are in how statistically rare it is that these things happen. It, it shows you, and then you factor in how many of these people are on anti depressants, how many of these people are being weened off of antidepressants? Those numbers are terrified because when you look at the correlation and the correlation does not equal causation is there's a weird argument, but it's an undeniable factor that has to be at least debated and discussed. There are so many fucking people in this country on disassociating meds on things that allow you to get away with you. You could justify and do and act in horrific ways and not exactly know what the fuck you're doing.

Speaker 1:          01:35:53       That is one of the problems that's associated with certain antidepressants and too dumb to not connect those two is crazy and to not, and even if they're not medicated, forget about the medication because the medication is one issue with the type of person that can go into a fucking school and shoot a bunch of kids. If you don't think that's a mental illness issue, oh, it's only a gun issue. That's fucking crazy. It's not a gun issue. That's like calling nine slash 11 a plane issue. Right? It's not. It's not a gun issue. The gun factor is real. There is a problem if psycho people and people with criminal records are people that are mentally disturbed, combined guns, yes. That's a problem. You know, what else is the problem? The fact that I can get a fucking, I can get a gun and I don't even know how to use it. That's a problem. Sure. You have to have a license to drive a car. If someone has to sit with you that you have to take these turns, you have to turn right here, you have to fully stop at the stop sign. You have to do all these things. And if you don't do it, don't. You don't get your driver's license. Oh, you have to do is not be a criminal and you'd get a gun. Right? That is fucking crazy.

Speaker 3:          01:36:52       And at any age two. And that's relevant. Uh, my nephew is eight years old. When he got last Christmas, he got a gun and we live in the country. That's normal. Kids have guns by the time they're eight years old at three, four years old. They're starting with bb guns. They advanced to appellate. You've got a shotgun. Some parts of the world go, man. That's insane. You gave a kid a gun. Well, where we live out in the car. Yes. The kid has the gun at the other side of it though, there is no crimes where I come from, done with a gun, whether a guy's doing a simple robbery and I don't mean to dismiss that, but in the in the eyes of murder, it is never and one of the reasons that we maintain is when you have guns and you grow up with guns, you learn the dangers of guns. You never play with those things. You never point those things at anybody. When you're out shooting watermelons and pop cans or whatever it may be. You learn real fast. This is why I don't pull a gun. This is why I don't do this because we don't. We don't know anything about the things like the cities in New York and all these people that are trying to take the guns away. We don't know anything about that out in the country. Never. We don't have any gun problems and everybody's got them.

Speaker 1:          01:37:48       Well, don't you also think that living in a place like the country where everybody does have guns, that is very different environment than living in a city. If everybody had guns in the city, you have so much more tension going on. It's so much. It's so much different. Like the environment's different like that. I don't necessarily think it would be great if New York City had as many guns per capita as Oregon. Sure, sure. In your original point on this is the only thing that stops you from getting a gun is having a felony is like, well that makes sense and nobody's disputing that, but there's got to be a few more things. To your point, we need to find out if you're medicaid as simple drug tests. This is pretty quick. You know, the NRA is real big that a guy gets a gun today because he might need to say, well no, the guy's got to plan ahead.

Speaker 1:          01:38:31       It's just like a driver's license. Maybe. Maybe the 16 year old has a date on Saturday, but if he doesn't have the license and he's going to have to postpone the date because there needs to be more things than just simply going, you know, let, let me run your fingerprints and if something comes back to your point, are you on drugs and medication? How about a train of thought? I've never heard anybody make that argument before, but I love that analogy. You have to get a license for a car. It's pretty simple process but you have to do it. Why you shifted it with a gun too because people need to know why you don't use guns 100 percent. I mean you have to get a hunter safety, a certificate if you want to hunt and if you want to use the gun and you know it's really, it's very detailed in most states.

Speaker 1:          01:39:07       You have to have one in many states at least. Actually, I don't even think you have to have in California, but you, which is weird because California is like one of the most restrictive states when it comes to firearms, but you, you have to go through this long difficult course and you have to pass tests and you have to actually know what the fuck you're doing and if you don't you don't get your hunter safety certificate and then you can't. You can't hunt, can't get a license, right? Yeah. You can't get a license and I think that what the NRA does is they take a hard stance on the side of promoting guns and they don't move. Not only do they not budge, they almost are unreasonable in their position, but I feel like that is because the left is so unreasonable when anything goes on, they immediately want to ban guns and take guns away that it's not.

Speaker 1:          01:39:54       It's not feasible at this day and people are like, well, we're going to do that. Australia, Australia is 20 million people. It's the size of the continental United States. To Equate Australia with the United States is insane. There's just way too many people here. It's a completely different and by the way, they didn't ban guns in Australia. People hunt with guns. You can get guns, you can register guns. You get them. You'd go to. You'd be belong part of hunting clubs like they do in Europe. You keep them stored in lockers. It's not a full on band. On firearms is just much more restrictive. The NRA is trying to stop restrictions and the reason why they're trying to stop restrictions because you know when anything goes on television, it's very disingenuous for someone to go on television after some sort of a massacre and not bring up all the factors, not bring up psych meds, not bring up mental health, not talk about the correlation between raising kids in abusive households and having children grow up with this, these horrible lives, and then they go on and become fucking psychopaths.

Speaker 1:          01:40:53       Sure, there's a correlation there. It's not simply whether or not the kid had the tool to do the job. It's like, why the fuck did they want to do that in the first place? And then you find out so many of these cases, like this guy in Orlando, the FBI had them on a watch list just a couple of years ago twice. Yeah. I mean, come on man, that, that fucking kid in Colorado that killed everybody at the movie theater. They knew that guy was out of his fucking mind. He had talked about killing a bunch of people and there's a lot of those cases where they get ignored and that's a giant issue and I don't know how to solve that issue because what do you do when someone comes along and says, Hey, I'm thinking about going into a movie theater and killing a bunch of people. I'm just kidding. You know, like what do you, what do you, do? You know how I'm going to go buy your first statement and lock you up forever? You know, I don't know. I don't know what to do there. And I, I think there's a gigantic argument when it comes to gun violence in this contract, but there's a gigantic argument when it comes to mental illness and we're pushing that one aside.

Speaker 3:          01:41:46       Yeah. And I think they just do it at the wrong time, you know, they get emotions involved. Jfk made a statement, uh, back when he was president, never let a good crisis go to waste. So it is believed by politicians. When you have a crisis, that's when you go on the attack. But that's when the emotions are the highest. I disagree with this statement. It's a good time to get your agenda out there, but you're just pissing people off and you're entrenched in them in their own views. A great time to bring up the gun argument. I'm pro gun, but I do understand. Look, there's some room to give her. I love what you said about a licensed. You relate that to a driving a car. It makes perfect sense. Bring it when emotions are a little bit less comfortable and go, hey, listen, let's make sure we do this.

Speaker 3:          01:42:20       And if you're worried about your safety, kind of get a little bit proactive here. Start the process that you can have a gun if that's what you want to do. But I don't agree. I think that they're, they're, they're wrong. Following Jeff K's model that he said in 1964, I think here in 2016, let emotions die down a little bit, let not people not be pissed on one side or the other. Worried about protecting themselves and their family were worried that something's going to happen to themselves with their family. You get good people with really different views here. I think that they're misplacing jfk philosophy in my opinion. In 2016, let things die down a little bit and then bring it up.

Speaker 1:          01:42:51       Yeah, and there's also this weird adherence, concrete adherence to the bill of rights and you know the second amendment. I mean, yeah, I think that people should look. I don't think if there's only three of us in this world. All right, you, me and Jamie were the only ones. If Jamie came along and said nobody could have guns, I think we would get together and go, fuck that guy. Who's this guy to tell us what we can and can't do. That same thought process could be applied to 300 million people. It just. I don't agree that a grown human being should be able to tell another grown human being what they can and can't do as long as it's not like if you say, hey joe, I'm thinking about starting a fucking nuclear power plant in your backyard and I'm pretty sure it know what I'm doing, but if we're going to have to move to the middle of the ocean, right, well then we got a problem and you could sort of apply that logic to guns.

Speaker 1:          01:43:40       You say, well, you know, if you, if you're a fucking gun nut and you'd like to shoot guns off in your backyard and you know, you might ricochet one and fucking shoot my dog or something, then it becomes a safety issue and a health issue. But it's hard to justify using the words of people that lived in the fucking 17 hundreds when it comes to today with the kind of guns that we have with the kind of society that we have with the kind of just our, our, our across the board, our legal system, our, our, our, our system of government, representative, government, all that stuff is fucking bananas in the world of 2016. Representative government has no place in a world where everyone has social media where everyone can be represented instantaneously. You don't have to get on a fucking horse and take a parchment across the country to hand it to some dude in a powdered wig that's old that we don't need that anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:44:35       So when you start talking about things that are in the bill of rights and things that are in the constitution, ge think it's time to update that fucking ancient piece of shit. I mean it's, it was great. They had amazing insight. They were brilliant people. We owe them everything. This experiment of self government, the United States of America was founded on, is a fantastic invention and it's one of the reasons why so much art and creativity and innovation and freedom come from this part of the world, but to rely on the exact words written with a fucking feather back when people were taken wooden boats across the ocean, hoping they wouldn't get eaten by Indians when they land in here. I mean the native Americans. Sorry. Um, it's, it's, I just think it's ridiculous to say anything we're not supposed to know. So it was right up there with retard. And could you say homo? I think he's still, say Homo. Homo sapiens.

Speaker 2:          01:45:25       I did not know that. Politicians try to be correct all the time and say African American. But that term is wrong. It's black. Yes. Not all. Not all blacks are Africans. A lot of people from Haiti. Yeah. To your point that people have this absolute fetish for the constitution. No matter how many times we've amended over the years and it extends to the bill of a bill of rights to it and they need to take, you know, you bring up a feather, but, and that's accurate. They sign it with a feather, but they were also married to their cousin and they bathed once a week and they had slaves. There you go. And it's like, hey guys, things changed. So these guys did their level best at that time, but they couldn't see the world and it, you know, in perpetuity. And then assign it is no matter how many times we've amended the constitution, you guys still have a fetish that this was like the Gospel. This wasn't touched by the hand of God. This was written by knuckleheads with eighth grade educations. Yeah. And just do what?

Speaker 1:          01:46:12       And the thing about the bill of rights, the reason why they cling to that second amendment is because it does state that you have the right to bear arms. So they got it. It's written down. It's all right.

Speaker 2:          01:46:22       Sure we got it. And people also love the basis behind it. It wasn't about hunter and gatherer like some people say it was about, look, if our government has guns, then we have guns so that we can always overtake our government should we need to now in the world of tanks and aircraft and everything. Of course that doesn't. That doesn't hold, but that's the part that people like. They don't want to give their government the power of the people don't have. That is a wonderful philosophy, but it's. It's kind of outgrown itself. It has

Speaker 1:          01:46:46       ron itself in the United States of America in 2016, but if the shit hits the fan and it absolutely could. We are one natural disaster away from chaos at all times and that is something that has happened all throughout human history. There have been gigantic asteroidal impacts. There have been super volcanoes. There have been tidal waves. There's been a lot of shit that happens. Then all of a sudden, chaos mean we saw what happened with Katrina. Katrina hit and there was looting and rioting and chaos and people have the right to defend themselves and protect themselves in that kind of situation. When people go crazy, then you factor in the possibility of government going crazy. That is just as much of a possibility. It's happened all throughout history. It's happening in Russia right now. Sure. Russia is being run by fucking gangsters and not the sun and Kai. Sure.

Speaker 1:          01:47:38       A different kind of gangs. Right? I mean, Putin is a murderer. He's a tyrant for sure. One hundred percent. Yeah. I mean, I'm not an effective leader for, for all the wrong word, but yeah, he is effective. Yeah. Uh, I, I just, uh, I think there is an argument that when people have ultimate power, they also have massive potential for corruption. We see that today with the Clinton campaign, this, this, this nonsense with the fucking emails and they'll classify data that she had inadvertently or purposely sent through email and then the difference between her take on it and what the FBI's take on it was like this clearly lying going on. There's clearly corruption going on because clearly people protecting her and that kind of corruption where it wouldn't apply to you and it wouldn't apply to me. We would go to jail. Sure. If we, if we sent those same emails, if we were involved in the transfer of top secret information through erroneous fucking pathways or however the fuck she did it, and I'm not, I don't exactly know the specifics, but if we did any of those things, we would most likely be convicted and we would most likely at least get find a massive amount of money, but more likely.

Speaker 2:          01:48:52       Sure. Martha, Martha Stewart went to jail just for lying to the FBI. You know, now is in that same jam. The FBI saying they didn't look into it. That whole thing is very for gazy. Yeah, no, that whole thing is very corrupt and I think that call me at the FBI's a reasonable guy or are however, I tend to believe him, but that was never a fair shake. Obama stays out of the whole thing. Then he finally comes in a law lynch. Loretta Lynch finally comes in and says, well, we're going to honor whatever the FBI says, and then four days later the FBI drops the news. It's like, guys, this is. Forget this has been going on for a year. You know, I'll tell you something else you know who looks weak in the whole thing is the FBI. These guys are supposed to be great. We put 40 people on the Hillary Clinton place to put that in perspective for the listeners, for people were assigned to Al Capone 10 times the amount and it took them one year of having the evidence to make a ruling. I mean, come on, that's weak and the same thing's going on with Isis. We're supposed to have this great military and no offense to the people that serve, but offense to the people that are handcuffing our. Our military isis, when I first

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       had heard about them for the very first time was 200 members strong. Now they are 4,000 strong and weak. Still can't stop these guys and we're supposed to be the best. Look. Of course we could. We just don't, but it makes us look weak. That would not happen in Russia. Nobody attacks the Russians. If you attack poot and you will be fighting Putin right now, no permission, no congress, no bs. You want to go, you're going to go with Russia, and that's why nobody

Speaker 1:          01:50:12       does. I think you're right. I think you're definitely right, and when there's direct evidence of Clinton's statements versus the FBI statements, Clinton saying, I only used one device. FBI saying choose multiple devices. No Clinton saying that no classified or top secret documents were shared or leaked. FBI saying hundreds, hundreds, hundreds and deleted. Yeah, it's all fucked. It's all fucked, but that's corruption and that he thinks, and this is not the kind of corruption that we need to be absolutely terrified of like they're going to come and steal our children and take all our money away and and fucking shoot anybody who talks back, that's not that level of corruption, but it's a slippery slope with any corruption. If the laws don't apply to you because your name is Hillary Clinton, but the law applies to Chilson under Joe Rogan. That's nonsense. That's not, that's not the world that we want.

Speaker 1:          01:51:01       That's the real problem. When someone is outside of the law or the law respects them in a different way that it respects you, that's not good, and that's why the second amendment exists is second amendment exists to stop fuckery because people are crazy and when people say, Whoa, it's about muskets and it's not. It's not. It's for a militia. It's only the guns or no, no, no. It's to prevent this kind of shit from getting completely out of hand. It's prevent the government from taking over and allow people to form a resistance. Sure. To be honest.

Speaker 3:          01:51:36       Yeah. Hey. So many people think that trump's crazy and he's going to lead us into warrants like guys sometime read the art of war. Just read the art of work is the best general never fires a shot. Ever poot and hasn't had a whip. A lot of vast. No poodle kill you if he needs to, but he hasn't had. He took over a part of the Ukraine, didn't kill a person. He rolled in. He said he wanted it and now he has a part of the Ukraine k, that's leadership. He aligned, but it's late. I'm not saying this is good, but that's what a leader does. A leader makes a decision. He goes in and takes her and he didn't have to kill anybody. The best general never fires a shot. Donald trump isn't planning to go and with people he's planning to make people think he will whip them, which is why he's not going to get us into wars and people.

Speaker 3:          01:52:15       A lot of people don't see that and trump can't come out and reveal this big curtain. Or people go, oh well the whole thing's a joke. He can't do that. So he's got to stand this ground, take people saying he's crazy. Hope that enough. Uh, enough people get it to vote them into office, but that's all he's doing. He's going around saying it's our way or the highway where the economic power will the military power. We do things right and you're gonna do it our way and we're not going to do a lot of compromising. When you align like that, you look at North Korea, all the craziest they do there. They scare everybody. For years we've paid a bunch of money. Bill Clinton paid them 8 billion. George Bush paid them six and a half billion. I mean, it doesn't matter

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       if you're Democrat or Republican, you're paying these knuckleheads for making straight. They've never fired a shot. They just understand the art of war. Talked to whoever talks stuff is the toughest on the playground. Everybody listening to this had a tough guy in school. Hey, what was the toughest guy in school? Everybody listening to this right now can go on. Take that guy. They all know. I'd ask them a follow up question. Did you ever see him getting a fight? And all of them are going, no, no. Who'd fight him? He was the toughest guy in school. Whoever talks the toughest is the toughest, and those rules don't change from the playground to the octagon, to the White House. They don't change the best. General never fires a shot.

Speaker 1:          01:53:21       When I was in high school, the toughest kid beat the fuck out of everybody. My name is frank piece. He was fucking huge. It's most likely on steroids. He was a gigantic fuck. He was so terrified. My sister dated him for awhile. He used to imagine how have your sister date the toughest guy in the school? Oh, he was a gorilla. He used to be able to remember those universal machines and where they had the stack, what was the stack like? Two 50 or something like that. He could bench the whole stack like several times and everybody was like, whoa. He does the stack. He does that. He had giant stretch marks all over his tits and he was like 17 with these things. It is most likely a steroids. Pretty sure. Well, I ran into a many, many years later. He's a great guy by the way.

Speaker 1:          01:53:59       And um, he was quite a bit smaller when I ran into him many years later. Like, Oh, where's the rest of you? But you know, that was back when people really didn't even understand steroids. It wasn't a, there wasn't a lot of people on them, but my point being toughest kid in my school beat the fuck out. Everybody went to a college party and beat the fuck out of a bunch of guys. That'll do it. Yeah. He knocked down the nation. That'll carry over. He was a brick shit house that kid, but yeah, but I understand what you're saying. Sure. This Donald Trump thing, which which is interesting to me, is that what he's done is he's gotten the media to work for him because he found a weakness in what they do. Would they like to do is I'd like to talk shit with the media likes to do is they look to find something that they feel like is going to be embarrassing or something that they can focus on and really drone on and on about it, but with him he owns it and it's similar to what you were talking about with promoting yourself and promoting yourself as a fighter.

Speaker 1:          01:54:56       He's promoting himself in a lot of the ways the same way. Kind of the you would do. I mean, what he's doing is he's not apologizing. He's saying provocative things and because of that he gets more air time than anybody else. By far, I mean it's not even close. All the other guys in the Republican, the Republican candidates, they were all playing second fiddle. They were all trying to catch up. They were even trying to do his thing like Marco Rubio was making fun of his hands and what does he do? He turns into a big Dick joke. She's like, don't want my. I'm fine in that department. Don't want right. I'm fine in that department, and everybody's like, Hey, he's holding it. He's talking about his dick. This is amazing, and it got him even more fans. I think people are tired of what the game is right now.

Speaker 1:          01:55:42       What the is right now. As a guy gets on a podium, he says a bunch of things that you know and I know will fucking never happen. Obama, everybody was hope and change. Hope and change. He's going to close Guantanamo Bay. He's going to get us out of Iraq. He's going to get us out of Afghanistan. We're still in Iraq. We're still in Afghanistan. Guantanamo base. Still here. No hope. No change. Drones are everywhere. We're gonna. We're gonna. Let whistle blowers off the hook. Bullshit. Cracks down on whistle blowers more than anybody. More military than George W Bush. Okay? More more attacks on free press than any Republican, a republican president, but because he doesn't under the guise of being on the left, people don't look at the cold hard reality of his actions. Yeah, so it's a bullshit fucking scam. So this guy comes along and he plays it like a pro wrestler. He plays it like a reality TV star. He plays it like a guy who is savvy about the media. He's been working the media his whole career and it's working.

Speaker 3:          01:56:43       Yeah. No, I love it. And to your point, he is running his presidential campaign the way Vince Mcmahon would promote a wrestle mania and he's getting attention. He's evoking any emotion. Front row. Brian actually told me that. Who's watching right now? He keeps texting me so quick. Shout out to him. I'm stealing his line, but he's right about that and he's evoking emotion. He's getting people involved. He understands that ratings are what get you on TV. He understands he can save money for that. He's also refused to take donations. He doesn't want to be. Body wants everybody to understand that he's going to go in free and clear and oh, nobody anything but, but he wouldn't, but wait a minute. He just requested a bunch of donut. He took it back, but he. But Joe, he was very candid about it. He said, I have been funding this myself any scent, and frankly I haven't gotten a very good return.

Speaker 3:          01:57:24       I'm funding this myself so everybody knows I'm not button sold that I haven't made deals that I'm going to go in there and actually represent the paypal. I'm going to take a pay cut. I'm going to go do a job. I don't want to do it because it's a job I think I need to do. That message didn't get out and he said, look, I'm losing in the polls to somebody who is bought and paid for because she's got more money than me. You people don't seem to understand this message of me going in there not owing anybody anything. I haven't got an investment on my return and I'm thinking about taking it back and open it up today. He, but he was very honest about it. He was very candid. I thought he had like an emergency drive. He did and he just. He pulled the back. No, no, no, no. What I'm saying. You had the emergency drought, but that was interesting too. He said, I want to raise $10,000,000 in two days, and by the way, if you guys give me 10, I'll throw another tenant on myself. So he ended up matching. He put 20 million and then he did it again. It was such a success. He did it again.

Speaker 1:          01:58:12       Well, it's, it's a weird situation for the Democrats because if Hillary did get indicted and if Hillary did wind up getting convicted, are they punished her in any way? It's over. That's hides over. Right. So who else is there? Bernie Sanders. They don't want that, right? Nobody wants that. That's just crazy old socialists.

Speaker 3:          01:58:34       A lot of a lot of people is Vermont. She's picking up a Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. No, I don't think so. I think she's cognizant enough

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       to know that America does not want to look sexist, but it in fact is that America is going to have a hard time putting a female as the commander and chief of the military who doesn't come out and endorse anybody, but if you talk to them privately, they do not want to be led by a woman. That's a reality. I think she's smart enough to know they damn sure don't want to be led by two but there, but. But of course would never say that publicly. Right. We don't want to look sexist as a country even though we are. If Hillary wants to put the nail in the coffin of this campaign, she puts. Bill is our VP. She does not have an ego that would allow her to do such and I think she might make the air of putting Elizabeth

Speaker 1:          01:59:18       warning. Man, that would be a weird thing because Elizabeth Warren pretended that she was native American. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:59:25       She lied. Straight up lie and that's racist. No way around that whole cultural appropriation. That's a big thing today. There's no way around that one. She should've did and then what she commented on her. Well, my eyes look this way. She, yeah, it got bad. It got bad and trump instead of just. Instead of saying it the way you use it, well you know you lied about me. He called her pocahontas, Pocahontas. Everybody says that's. He says it more will. He calls Bernie Sanders crazy. Bernie called Hillary Lion. Hillary. Crooked, crooked, Crooked Hillary. That's smart. I mean, look what he does by labeling them and then a white lion. Ted. That's great. It's wrestling me. He gave me the ball. He didn't. He gave them all a gimmick.

Speaker 1:          02:00:02       Well, he juked the system. The system was based on deception the first place and they had this whole standard operation. The way they would run things, they would all do it the exact same way and he came in and exposed all the flaws in the game. Yeah. And he's not done and he's not backing off and everybody keeps waiting in the backyard it because it's not the real presidential candidate. I mean, it's not the real campaign yet. The real campaign begins once. It is absolutely hillary and absolutely him and it gets boiled down, like right now we're in July when it gets to be August and then September, that's when Shit's gonna really start flying and you know it's going to be interesting to see what he uses to try to attack her and what she used to try to attack him and how both there they're both going to get damaged in the process and our system is going to be damaged in the process and that's something that I think everybody is kind of cognizant of when you destroy someone who is on their way to become the commander and chief, you kind of weak in the whole nation because that person becomes the like, look, if Hillary won, say if the elections were tomorrow and the FBI thing happened today and then she winds tomorrow and everybody's going to be like, Ooh, we know she did something that we would have been punished for.

Speaker 1:          02:01:14       How is this weakens the position and it weakens it in the eyes of the world too. I'm sure

Speaker 2:          02:01:19       it does. It does. When we talk about vp picks, I'm not sure that they've got to write. The media thinks they've got it narrowed down to four guys and they added one more for trump on trump's side. Christy and Gingrich and pence and they've. They've got five and I don't think they're right. I think that he will go outside the box. He's not going to put a woman in there just just to put a vagina on the ticket and think he's going to do like mccain did with

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       Pailin. I think he's going to bring in somebody that's either got admiral or colonel or general next to their name. I think that it is very important for him to look powerful and be powerful and I think he wants a military guy and I think that's who he admires. I don't think he admires politicians. I think he admires soldiers.

Speaker 1:          02:01:56       That would be interesting if he did that and that would be a huge step up if he did do that and in in, in terms of like how public responded to him because if he's like the big showman, but he's got some very serious guy with some real world experience as his second guy, that would be a really interesting. It's just to me, it's just disturbing that we're down to a reality TV star and an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blow job. He got in the nineties show. The whole thing is

Speaker 3:          02:02:22       disturbing Bill Clinton tree to the White House like it was a frat and I will forever appreciate that. I just will. I just. Well, I mean he was a mess. He was all these different. He was unapologetic. He was the master liar member. The divisible in the not denominator and he was going in all these circles and before you're done, you just flat out confused, man. That Oxford degree really sent me in circles. I guess we give this guy a pass. He's an odd dude, man. He's a very odd dude and he still swing and he's still swinging out there for his wife. Yeah. And See, that's another one though, Joe, if you don't mind me interrupting, if he would've just told the truth back then, just use the truth on a site. It would have all been done if he would've just said, man, I'll sleep with anything in the world except her.

Speaker 3:          02:03:00       If he would've just done that, it'd be all over and said he started getting crazy. If he would've hit them with that line. You know, it's the same thing. It's the same thing with, uh, with trump right now. If he would have just said, look, I think that America should have a long leash, but attached to that Leisha is a big old bomb and this is how we're going to do it and we'll light the thing if we have to. It's hard to deal with. It's really hard to deal with. I got all of this, this philosophy from you giving me your take on how Michael Richards should have handed the comedy store. When you said he should've come out, he should have said, here's my problems. I'm not a funny comic. Okay. I was self conscious. You guys made me feel bad. I wanted to hurt your feelings. Had nothing to do with race. I tried to hurt your feelings and you're right. It all would have gone away because we go, yeah, that, that is what happened. You know, it is what happened.

Speaker 1:          02:03:40       But, and that's precisely with Charlie Sheen did when Charlie Sheen came out and he said, look, this is how I roll. I smoke rocks, I pay girls to leave. I don't pay him to have sex. And everyone was like, what the fuck? What, what do you say to that? You can't say anything. And everybody was Hashtag Tiger blood. It was all over the. I mean he became sort of until the HIV thing came that kind of put an accountant

Speaker 3:          02:04:02       that put a damper, but you're right. Sheen was the original Shin was the originalist sat in the hot speed. Everybody was waiting for the tearful Jon Jones style apology and it did not come. She huge because it ended up doing a comedy or a an appearance tour, whatever he saw. He did seven and a half million dollars in tickets on a two week tour because of that one sit down where he refused to apologize. Why I like to party.

Speaker 1:          02:04:24       I didn't even have any comedy. He didn't know what to do, so he went to these things coked up thinking he was just going to power through it with charisma and people were bu in and people and he's like, Hey, I got your money. I already got your money, which is fucking crazy

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       to yell out of people that have bought your tickets. But then he adjusted. He got smart and you brought guys like Russell Peters in to sit down with them and interview him and they actually worked out a routine and it actually became an entertaining show towards the last leg of the tour. But his ability to step up and say, hey, I like coke. I like to smoke coke. I get together. I get a bunch of girls. I pay him money. I fucked up and then they leave and everybody's like, well, because that's what everybody's always avoided to catch someone always doing trucks like prostitute. The cover up is always worse than the crime. Again, you go back to John Jones, John Jones gets tagged in that coke thing. He pops on Fox and the and the woman asks him why he did it and that was Sam Johnson. Well, you know, but any, any try to dance around.

Speaker 4:          02:05:22       He had his pocket of. I did it to get high. Next question. Stupid. Yeah. That's it. So, yeah, it was funny. I was at a party having a good time. I didn't know you're going to test me, right? That's the answer. But use the truth on your side is just, it just shuts everybody down and it's, it's endearing and refreshing. Well, this, this current thing that he's on right now, um, I wonder if he can do that with this. I mean, I wonder if he knows what it was that he took. You know, I mean, I just don't know. I know I'm, I'm really, I'm confused by this one because I don't know how many different options there could have been where these are the two things that he tested positive for. I don't know how many options there could have been other than him taking that because he was getting off steroids, but that doesn't even seem to make sense because he had been tested like much more recently or before that, like we're close to that and he didn't have that in his system and he didn't have steroids in a system. But to victor context credit, Victor Conte did question. Jon Jones is a testosterone levels and EPA testosterone levels before carbon isotope tents. Yes. Yeah, and they were for Gazy. What could cause that at various same. All you're going to do is confuse people when you start talking about that, and frankly you can't get doctors to totally agree. Even with Sada, with their highest scientists and everything there. There's some confusion there.

Speaker 3:          02:06:42       There was something for gazy going on, but it wasn't enough. It was just enough to start rumors not to actually take him in and, and go against him. But you know, you glossed over what I opened the show with and I thought it was going to be one of the high points of the whole podcast. I didn't know if you had to do it. No, not the cop. I don't know if you had this, so I don't mean to go back to it, but the point that this test that we're all talking about is June 16th and there could. There's got to be another shoe that's getting ready to drop now. Whether that comes back hot or what it comes back clean, we don't know, but there is no way that Assad sought last time testing a guy for a fight that was supposed to take place this last Saturday. It was June 60. There's just no way. They've got to be at least another test out there and possibly to brock lesnar. They test him every other day for stuff five

Speaker 4:          02:07:22       times within the first two weeks. That was in the first two weeks. Eight times. Same thing. They did the same thing to her. They tested her a ton of times. Yeah. I don't know. I mean we. This is just speculation, right? We really won't know and I'm sure we'll find

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       out shortly because those tests take a while to get the results back because they're very, very thorough and if he tested June 16th, you've got to assume big, high profile, UFC 200. And the guy was already tested positive for some time before. So they're gonna. They're gonna be sneaking around trying to catch him. What was the crazy story where he went? He was hiding. Is that true? I wasn't there. I'll tell the story. All right, let's tell the story. Assata came in and it gives us, by the way, this is a legend. It is, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:08:05       Story. The story. But uh, this from some, some of those teammates, UFC fighters that claimed they were there, but that. And that doesn't make it true. Myfi guys tired of him beating the fuck out of them. All the disclaimers aside. Let's get down to the entertainment side of this. So solder rolls in to Jackson's gym to do a test on John Jones and there was only some coaches in there. And John, if there was like five people there at the time so he can see them coming. They where they parked, he can see them coming so they don't know what to do with them. They hide them underneath the cage. They hired John John tides up to the cage. They tell John we don't know where he is and this is before we were enrolled in the program and he did not need to disclose his whereabouts.

Speaker 2:          02:08:46       At the same time, if they show up and find you, you must tap vandelay this situation, you must test. They can't find you. You didn't have to test back this. So anyway you hides under the ring. They said, well where is he supposed to? You know, this is Jim. They said, well how would I know where he is? So instead of leaving like they thought they would, do they take a seat? Well there's like eight hours left in the business day. They don't ever leave. However, along with six to eight hour timeframe, John's under the cage the entire time. So people are coming and going the whole thing. And finally they shut the lights off and go to lock the doors. Now John can come out. What we found out about that and they want it. They didn't do this. They wanted to get a warrant and go under that ring under the theory that at some point in that six to eight hour span, he would've had a pee where they wanted to go under forensically and collect that urine.

Speaker 2:          02:09:33       That's how upset they were that they had been had. Now I realize that we're saying all the nice to have a that happened. How long was the timeframe and all of that, that, that part. That part's coming after him. After that, when they found out that they had been to anything they hate, they don't like when people say their test doesn't work and they don't like being duped and they came after. I remember when I predicted rumbled, Jones will not happen. Yes you did. That's because I had that story and I knew soda was looking for him. I knew they had boots on the ground in albuquerque waiting for him to lead the club late and for it to get him for anything. I was armed with that. I've never told that. So that's why I predict that fight. What had happened, I knew they were after him and this is before we had to do the whereabouts like we do now. Back then it was just random and they had people, they were just waiting. They were just waiting for the right time and they were going to grab him.

Speaker 1:          02:10:22       Wow. To get a. If they got a warrant to check underneath the well, how would they prove that it was his pee? That's a lot of fighters or dirty. There's a lot of problems, you know, just in just

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       like, just to show support. They could all just whip their dicks out and pea underneath the cage. Yeah, sure. I mean if you really love the guy, pollute the water better yet, Joe, you go under and you clean underneath the cage. That would also solve the problem, but it turns out John's pregnant. Look right, get under there and yeah, it was just a mess, but yeah, that's, that's could be anybody's urine. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't. I mean, that's a great story though. It's one of the great all time of avoiding a drug test story. Sure. Maybe the best, right? Yeah. Um, you came out here to promote a submission grappling thing to it. Yeah. We got a big thing coming up a Sunday this coming Sunday, yet July 17th. Live and free on flow combat and you've got to be a member, right?

Speaker 2:          02:11:15       That's, that's the trick. Sell to it, but you're not buying a paper review window. You get, you just get a monthly subscription. There's flow combat, combat.com. F fellow. That's right. FL, low combat. Thank you for correcting me on that. Ebi Rules, Eddie Bravo. Invitational rules that they'll go for eight minutes. There's no score. You either find a submission or you don't. If you don't, you go into an overtime format. Now you know how Ebi Works and this is the biggest promotion of the whole thing, isn't that somebody is going to go out and compete and I got to do some grappling since I've been retired, but we all, we always had a clause that if you could eat up the clock, you've got to draw. Nobody loses. Whether that's a victory. Sometimes when you're in over your head, you're up there wrestling for a draw. When I had a vow that was out there wrestling for a draw under Ebi rules, somebody is going to tap.

Speaker 2:          02:11:59       So when you factor in, you've got jake shields taken on. Chris Lidell, one of those guys is going to tap when you've got vinny Mongolians, maybe the best grappler there is right now. Mega lays. He always corrects me on that too. I feel like it's tomato, tomato, vinny Mokuleia. And so I said, uh, you know he's going to be taken on. Ronnie marks. King Mo got hurt. He hurt his neck. Ronnie marks has now stepped in. He fought. You were here? Yeah. Chemo hurt his neck. King Modena pulled out. I pulled him off the card. I found out he was hurt, it happened in, in his fight with Phil Davis and he's, he's one of the main training partners for Robbie lawler and he hasn't even been able to train with Robbie. I ran into Labario. Uh, you want to correct me on that name for you?

Speaker 2:          02:12:41       Thank you. Ran into Laborio over the weekend at the, at the super show. And uh, he said, man, King, King, Mo King, Mo can't move. He just doesn't. He doesn't want to pull out herniated disc. Yeah. Something like that. I don't have all the details, but I got to hold them all. I said, is this true? He said, yeah, I'm going to come to so many guys a fucked up next. Yeah, we got to pull that one. Sohani marks is in. He fought you. El Ramiro. Erin Simpson. Do you remember those? He just signed with world series of fighting a Sohani Zen against vinny. And then the biggest one, the absolute biggest one that wasn't meant to be, but this is the one that's got my phone ringing. Rico Rodrigues is coming back after all these years. He's going to take on [inaudible] or sharing, or my coach, he's going to take on my coach and one of them is going to tap into.

Speaker 2:          02:13:22       They will not leave until someone tells slot in the UFC back in the day. He's a excellent Brazilian Jujitsu practitioner. Yeah, that's interesting. Matter. Rico is a bad motherfucker, man. His ground game is very good. He's fantastic. He's fantastic. And then the question with Rico, Joe, you know, grappling is a gateway into mma. So now that Rico's all of a sudden back in grappling, that's everybody's big question, is he coming back to mma and he's one of those guys that left the sport on his own. There wasn't that a promoter when it sign them or Dana didn't want them or pride wouldn't put them under contract. He had those personal right. He did whatever, but he left on his own. It's kind of the way Sean Sherk left. Sean's just one day. It wasn't fighting anymore, but it took like two years until the announcement came. It just makes me wonder is Ricoh coming back?

Speaker 2:          02:14:03       And I think that that's pretty cool. If he is. It's very rare where a world champion returns that speculation, but let's see what happens. Well, it's an interesting matchup either way and so this is something you're doing for the first time on flow combat and you said that they have to become a member, like what does that entail? Giving up your email address or something? Yeah, you go over, you register a flow combat.com. I think it's like 15 bucks a month. 14 95. It's a network though. It's kind of like fight pass. There's. There's content, there's behind the scenes. It's a whole network, so you're not going to buy a paper view window that then shuts off. You become a member and then you can turn that off the next day. You can turn it off at the end of the month. You're going to buy for the month, so you get an entire package.

Speaker 2:          02:14:39       They've got a ton of members. He's a real successful guys, so it's Kinda just to satisfy them. The show soul that's completely sold out in Portland. It. It'll be, in my mind, the biggest grappling of whenever I've done metamorris. Metamorris was sold out, but they had 700 tickets. This is a lot more tickets sold out. The only way to watch will be on flow combat.com. So the guys that are participating are going to have a lot of fun. I did some grappling. I just took out Michael Bisping in a, in a grappling match. Roy Jones was on the car. It was this crazy car to uh, we wrestled in Arizona like the week after he beat Anderson. This just happened really? But nobody came. So people were like, you, they didn't even know what was going on. Oh, I had heard about Roy Jones boxing some fan, but fought a fan that goes five and three and mma, a two window, an amateur boxing.

Speaker 2:          02:15:24       And he gave Roy a match. He get Roy met. Roy figured about bumble, shut them off. Well, this is a boy had been knocked out brutally just a couple of months ago I think in Russia or Germany. And fight was. Yeah, that was, I was awful. Yeah. Roy is staying busy though. You know, I just hate to see them take punishment because he was such a great fighter. So good. It's just, it's so sad to see him now. His body just looks doughy. He doesn't look good. You know, he's still an excellent commentator though. I mean, it's not. It's not effecting the wheat talks. Right? That is true. Yeah. It was good to see Roy. But the point was, you know, that you had a limited amount of people there. So in grappling events and then metamorris now, or at least for the last one, they've got a show coming up too, but the last one they had, we wrestle in front of nobody.

Speaker 2:          02:16:05       I was kind of ended that. But the point is you grapplers like people there. I just kinda like that opposite field from going into a packed arena to that field. Get more of a practice room atmosphere at any rate with Kuma Tay, now that you're correcting all my words, is that what I'm trying to say? This one sold out. So the grapplers are going to wrestle. They're going to have a roaring audience and it's a rare thing. Well, the Eddie Bravo rules, Eddie Bravo invitation rules are without a doubt the best rules because they force guys in a bad

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       situation. So what it is is after the fight goes to the would you have eight minutes, eight minutes after it goes through the eight minute timed difference in there's a draw. What happens is you put guys in bad positions, so just like in wrestling, one guy will start on the bottom in Jujitsu, what they're doing with Eddie Bravo rules is one guy will start on your back or he'll start in a position called spiderweb, which means you're defending. You got the guy in the bottoms defending against an art bar. The guy on the top is inside control with the arm hooked and controlling the leg. So it's a bad spot to be in if you're on the bottom and it's a bad spot. If a guy obviously has your back. So by putting guys in those situations, you will allow the fight or to try to work from a really bad spot to try to get a tap.

Speaker 1:          02:17:13       And then you switched places. So if you started on my back and you tap me, then I have at least an opportunity to try to tap you and if you escaped and you wind up winning the whole thing, but it could be that you escape, escape, escape, escape, and we see a lot of those matches where it's like down to the wire and if that's the case then he count up the amount of time spent in control. So if it takes you 10 seconds to escape, but it takes me 30 seconds to escape, you would win because you escaped quicker, right? That's exactly right. It's a great way to figure out how to make grappling matches. Excited.

Speaker 2:          02:17:47       I talked to Eddie before we went into this and I said, hey listen, we're doing. What are you doing? We're getting. We can fall in the same day. It's how do you want to do this? You know, let's not get a battle with each other. He goes, no, no, no. Just the opposite. He said, I want these guys to have somewhere to wrestle. He said, but she'll do this. Take my rules, call it Abi. That puts me up, but he goes, but do it, and he had a great point, Joel, here's what his point was. He said, you know, everybody that has a grappling event wants to make up their own rules. He said, but as an industry for the gym owners, for the guys that are going into the gym and they're training everyday, they need to be able to train the same way the coach needs to be able to have a stopwatch just like he does mma.

Speaker 2:          02:18:17       Five minute rounds. You do three of them. If you're a man of intertidal fight, you do five of you go to a basketball court, you go volume. It's the same universal rules. He said, for an industry, we need to be all teammates, all Nogi Jujitsu. They need to be able to train the same way so the coach can run a practice and it doesn't have to go. You guys train to fraud Vodavi over here and you guys train them for the Ibj f over here and you get. So I thought, Eddie, you're right. If us promoters can all get together and unify some rules, like the unified rules of MMA as an industry, the trickle down, which is the gyms, we could get this thing figured out and then we can start to have a hybrid and Eddie's rules really are quite perfect. You know, he calls them the most gangster rules out there, but he's right. I talked to Vinnie, I talked to some other guys that I talked to. I talked to Sala Rivera. They're going, look, it's Ebi. That's how you find if you want to live the best is you got to go. Ebi Rules.

Speaker 1:          02:19:05       Yeah. It really is the best and it stops all these draws. These draws are brutal. I mean you have that a polaris match. You got all these amazing matchups and then Gary Tonin verses Paul Harris, draw other. Fuck. You haven't draws. Everything is a draw, draw, draw, draw. You can have people get excited about draws. They don't get excited about draws. That's not fun.

Speaker 2:          02:19:24       I talked to her about that and how it goes. You know, I do have. I do have one problem with that. He said, I guys are more, I can get them to, to wrestle more guys kinda like that, that clause, and you got to have a time limit somewhere and we don't quite know how to figure out the overtime yet. He said, but the problem I'm running into is I want to champion. He said, and it's hard to build a division and to decide who's the next number one contender if you don't have an architecture in place where a guy advances through a bracket, if you will, you have to have. You have to have a winter,

Speaker 1:          02:19:50       right? Yeah. Yeah. That is a giant issue with, uh, everybody else's rule set. I just think that if you look at submission grappling and especially people that have a problem with the quote unquote violence of MMA, the submission aspect of it is, it's beautiful to watch. It's exciting, it's dynamic and you watch someone get choked out. It's crazy. I mean it's, it's, it's really interesting. It's fun. It's a, it's an exciting part of martial arts and it's something that guys can do when they retire from fighting. It's something that a lot of people that don't want to get involved in mma, but guys like the Mendez brothers or there's a Gary Turner, he's actually probably going to do mma eventually, but all these super talented grapplers it gives them an opportunity to show their stuff.

Speaker 2:          02:20:33       Yeah, certainly. I love that. You know who Tony is, by the way. You know, he's so excited. He's crazy. Oh yeah. Turn it on. Yeah, he's. Yeah. He's just. He's fantastic. But you've got so many guys like this. You know, if you dangle that big carrot and all of a sudden you're just signing the most popular and the most famous guys. It's kind of tough. I really liked the Olympic model or even the NCAA model. The best guy always steps forward, but the best guy, a lot of times it has a hard time getting a chance. Promoters want guys that are going to sell. It's like, let's put that on hold. If you're a good promoter, you'll figure out how to sell. You just will. If you're a promoter, use Dana's. You'll bring in the bells and whistles, but let's give everybody a chance the same way the Olympics Games does. You know, lets anybody that thinks they're best. Raise your hand. Let's get an error figured out. Now we're gonna. Have to have a lot of events. We're gonna have to work, but let's get a system in place and let's figure it out. Boom. Boom. So instead of rules Ebi, what is your event called? It is called submission underground. It can be found@flowcombat.com. It's free to all members.

Speaker 1:          02:21:30       What is this? What does this video? Let's play this video and let's end on this video and anything more to tell people. I'm your son in ch on instagram a chain. What does it entail and on? On twitter. Absolutely. Facebook, all that gentleman. Yes.

Speaker 2:          02:21:48       Thank you for the plug. Bruce. Bruce buffer was going to announce the show. He. He fell on his acl as acl.

Speaker 1:          02:21:56       Yeah. He was doing a lip sync competition. Yes. And apparently he got up, he gutted it out and he tried to keep going and they tipped over sideways and fell over again. It's hilarious. Sad. Want Bruce to get better? Very funny. Very funny. Unfortunate is the second time he blew his knee out. Doing that too. By the way, he blew his knee out. That jumped that. He does. When he does that, he leaps in the air. He blew his acl out. Doing that. Wants to watch them live out of the ring. This is his second acl surgery. So it's, it's a fucking hard job folks. Okay. Alright. Chael and ladies and gentlemen, and we'll end with this son and submission underground. Again. Flow. What does that mean? Backflow. Calm, calm, calm.com. And it is this

Speaker 2:          02:22:41       July 17th live and free for all members

Speaker 1:          02:22:43       and we'll tweet it. It'll be on my twitter, so I'll let you guys know in advance. Thank you brother. Always great to have you on. And anytime you want to come on again, open invitation. Let's, let's play it

Speaker 2:          02:22:54       son and, and I am here to speak to you about the pathetic state of affairs in today's grappling competition. When grapplers come with promotions, bring these guys. They're not sending their best. They're boring, they're dull, they're not risk takers. I am going to change all of that. No more 20 minute matches where it can end in a draw. What kind of atmosphere is in a drop? This is anti-competition one set of rules. Somebody must win and somebody must lose. Guys, this is America. We don't go to draw. We play for keeps. We play for somebody to get their hand raised. Guys, if you don't know, you damn sure should know. On July 17th, submission underground is invading Portland. Oregon's Roseland theater. Now tickets are sold out, but you still got a chance. Go to your desktop, grab your smartphone, send a pigeon, send a fax if you have to, let your friends know. Don't be left in the dark Monday morning around the water cooler. Don't be the only person that didn't witness history. Go to flow combat.com. God bless America. Goodnight everybody.

Speaker 1:          02:24:01       That's a genius.
