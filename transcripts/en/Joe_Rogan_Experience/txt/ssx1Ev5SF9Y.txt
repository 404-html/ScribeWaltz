Speaker 1:          00:00:00       That's why you have a producer, jamie is on the ball. Talk a little closer to the light.

Speaker 2:          00:00:04       Yeah, get that sucker right up to you. Just pull it. You need to move it around. Bring it to you. You don't want to feel uncomfortable. These chairs that shit on it. Well, I've. Oh, we're live, live, live, live, live, live. Oh, uh, I'm here with my good pal. Ryan Callahan. How are you buddy? I'm doing swell. How are you doing his good pal. Ken Kruth met you before at the first light booth at the shot. Show those the first time I met you, right? I think so. I think that's it. Yeah. And we wanted to have you guys on, first of all because I like, I love your company. You guys got a great company. Firstlight makes really cool hunting clothes, outdoor clothes made out of you. Started out with Merino wool, which I think uh, before I went with Ryan and Steven Rinella, I really had no idea about the properties of Merino wool.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       I didn't know that it keeps you from stinking that it, that it really retains heat while you're wet. So it's got so many awesome properties to it, like if you go out for people that don't know, that don't go in the outdoors, but if you go out and you walk and it's cold out and you hike like a long distance and you get sweaty, if you're wearing cotton, you're kind of fucked. If it's really cold out, once you start getting sweaty, your body starts shivering and you get in a real bad place. We'll has this really weird quality and maybe you can help me explain that where, when it gets wet, it somehow or another still retains heat. So if you sweat in it, you still feel okay, I kinda know what's going on there.

Speaker 3:          00:01:28       Well, it, you know, it just naturally moves the sweat off of your skin and kind of tries to get it to the outermost layer and at which point then it can evaporate fast. But, um, you know, she passed to live in crazy environments, you know, it'll be hotter than shit in the summertime and then, um, you know, super cold in the winter. So, you know, over the course of evolution, they've got, you know, a coat that will deal with a massive amount of variance, you know, and will was pretty much the same. It's like you can wear it when it's, when you're sweating, bullets at pulls a sweat off and then, um, dries pretty quickly, but even when it's wet it pretends to 80 percent of its heat.

Speaker 2:          00:02:06       Yeah, it's amazing. It's amazing stuff. And is there a synthetic material that does the same thing?

Speaker 1:          00:02:12       Well, every synthetic is trying to a mimic down or be mimicked Merino wool because those are the two most efficient, um, you know, temperature, regulating fabrics or materials out there. Um, and that's, that's how you got into your prima lofts and your all, your military testing and that's where you saw synthetics really take off. Um, so yeah, so like a prima law for example, or some of your fleeces, they basically, um, combined something that loves water and something that hates water. So the thing that love loves water is going to pull moisture off and the thing that hates it is going to repel it and try to push it to the outside.

Speaker 2:          00:02:55       That's interesting. So it's like sort of a two layer process where something's trying to keep you dry and something is trying to like literally suck up the wet, like a sponge and then somehow or another your body heat then can regulate it because your body heat, you're staying warm because the dry is close to your skin and then the heat comes off your skin and it can dry out that stuff better.

Speaker 3:          00:03:16       Yeah, exactly. In your body heat, you're like your natural, you know, your natural zone, how much heat and how much moisture you push out is a major factor. Um, and especially when you get into some of your waterproof breathable, um, membranes and things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       That's something that I think really would surprise a lot of people when it comes to hunting clothing. They really would have no idea like how much, how much, how technical the stuff is and how much thought is put into it. And how, how, like involve the processes of creating this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       You know, it's funny because we all kind of came from the traditional, like ski, snowboard, snowmobile world, you know, grew up skiing. And so we've been, you know, involved in having super technical clothes since I was eight years old. Right, right. All the underwear stuff, Merino wool, all the different policies when that Kinda came out and replaced cotton when I was a kid and you know, um, they were great. But it wasn't until we kind of started using marina that we found something that, I mean, you know, if you go skiing or snowboarding or some sledding snowmobiling, right, you sweating bullets and if you get stinky, whatever, it's just how it always was, you know. But for hunting, it's a really a big deal, you know, if you can possibly kind of shrink your stink footprint just by a little bit, it can be the difference between succeeding that season or not, you know? And so we all started wearing Marino for whatever, you know, all of the other sports, you know, like skiing and snowboarding and, you know, pedal, bike and, and whatever. Um, and once we found out that it didn't stink, that was like, Whoa, that was a big deal, you know, because you could wear it for days and days. And so that was kind of the impetus. And at the same time I started taking over, I would say the traditional outdoor space, you know? Yeah. And you're. Nobody

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       is really popular with public land do it yourself. Hunters, guys who go out backpacking for long periods of time. And that's one of the reasons why they liked that Merino wool. And one of the reasons why I wanted you to have you guys on this, just talk about what's been going on lately with a hr six, 21 and now hr six slash 22. These two recent bills. They pulled her 6:21, Steven Rinella wrote a big article about it. But for the uninitiated, what these bills are about is there about selling off our public land, giving the states the ability to do whatever they want with it right now, these lands or federal, they're owned by the people of the United States. It's a very unusual situation that we have here. It's an amazing situation and there's very few countries in the world that have anything even remotely close to it where there's millions and millions and millions of acres that are available for anybody listening to this to go on you.

Speaker 2:          00:06:06       It's literally your land like back country hunters and anglers have that great shirt that I wear all the time. It says public land owner and I've seen you on it. And I'm going to tweet the picture of you and I from shot show where I was. I was with you and you were wearing that shirt. Yeah. That's such an important point for people because I didn't know it at all until I went with you guys until I went with Rinella and the crew. Uh, we went to Montana. That first trip with Brian Kaplan who's hopefully coming. That's why that door's open, folks, if you're watching this, we're leaving that door open because Collin is trying to make his way over here right now, but I didn't know that this public land system even existed and I think most people are unaware. They just don't. They don't understand how unique this is and how incredible like the, our forefathers, like their, their, their vision to make something so incredible that no one can go in and just fucking put malls up in

Speaker 1:          00:06:59       it is an amazing thing and I think this is like the easiest battle in the world. If we can somehow tell people your kid communicate even a fraction of our appreciation for it. It's just, it is the reason I get up in the morning.

Speaker 2:          00:07:16       Well, especially where you guys are [inaudible], you guys are like, you're in the boondocks man. I mean you guys are in Idaho and you're in a beautiful area, but you could literally like go out your back door and make a straight line through public land for forever. Like you could just go walk and disappear.

Speaker 1:          00:07:37       Oh yeah. I mean, we can walk straight north and cross, uh, uh, two highways and one interstate and keep going across the Canadian border, cross to more highways and be in the Yukon basically. So it's a wild junker ground. It's amazing. It is. And it's open to everybody. Everybody, you know, it's, it's an interesting issue because sometimes you know, you'll get mountain bikers, you get after the equestrian people or the. Yeah, the, the hikers get after the motor bikers, but it's an issue for every single person because no matter what sport you do or how you choose to enjoy the outdoors, that's your land. Once that's gone, it's gone.

Speaker 2:          00:08:24       Yeah. I mean and there are regulations like as far as where you can take motorbikes or where you can ride even bikes, right? Even trail bikes, but that set aside, man, there's some amazing country that you could just go get lost in. Just go wander, pitch a tent, drink out of a stream and you could stay there for long periods of time and it's totally legal. It's totally yours. Your tax dollars literally fund and support it and all the money that comes from buying hunting equipment, from buying tags from all that stuff is what pays to keep fishing game employed, makes sure that people are monitoring the health and the populations of the animals that live there and making sure that no one is breaking any laws. I mean, it's really an amazing, amazing system.

Speaker 1:          00:09:12       It is. It's unreal. And I want to clarify a couple of things. You like. All these national forests. I'm at any blm grounds. They all have their own regulations. So yeah, you can have of land management for folks that drill weekend manager. You guys are deep on the inside. You're gonna. Most people listen to us on a, what the fuck I'm talking about. That's right. So different for us. Have different regulations as far as how long you can stay camped in one spot. Um, typically it's 10 to 15 days and then you have to move again depending on where you are. X amount of, you know, sometimes it's 100 feet, sometimes it's 20 miles. Um, and then you can set up camp again, just arbitrary rules. It is not arbitrary. There's some smart folks out there that I'm study the impact of man on the land and they want to try to keep, you know, that pristine experience that we all love to go find right there for everybody. And they have an incredibly tough job because their mandate, their federal mandate is to manage that land for everyone.

Speaker 2:          00:10:23       How did you guys become a company that's so connected in people that do go into the outdoors and people that do hunt and, you know, enjoy your products. You guys are like really connected to public land conservation and you know, and these do it yourself, public land sportsman, like you guys are like very, very connected in that world. Like it's very, it's a very respected company in that world.

Speaker 3:          00:10:49       Thanks. I mean, you know, we do, we see it from all angles, you know, all of us have. And you know, in the summertime we'll, like I said, we'll ride mountain bikes and the wintertime backcountry skiing. It's all of a sudden, you know, and then hunting, of course it's huge. But you just see it from all angles, like places that where you recreate 365 days a year, all of a sudden you start to get sucked up and it's just like, wait a minute, wait a minute. You know, like if this wasn't, if we didn't have public lands, we wouldn't have a business, right. It, it, it would just wouldn't exist. You know,

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       decision. Our board of trustees didn't say it's high time. You

Speaker 2:          00:11:29       look at the United States being only founded in 17, 76 and you just look at the massive amount of land we occupy now with. There's just a greater Los Angeles area where there's 30 million people and you know, you go up all through the Pacific coast highway and just see all the cities and see all the buildings and see all the stuff that you would encounter if you try to try to drive from California to New York. The only thing that's stopping that whole fucking area from being covered with buildings and malls and gas stations and anything else they can stick in there is the fact that it's public land. It's that. It's, it's federally owned land and you can't build on it. There's some folks that want. They want it.

Speaker 1:          00:12:09       We drove that, what does it trip Panga Topanga Canyon and I was like, oh, there's a good looking house. And I was like, Oh God, there's houses everywhere in here. And then we came around the corner and there's a sign that says open space x amount. And I was like, yeah, cover that to open space up.

Speaker 2:          00:12:28       Gary said that open space that opened. Wonder what they mean by that. Whenever it's like, oh, orange sign on it right there. And it was like, like a park. Oh No, like a for sale sign for sale. Still Open. Yeah. There's a lot of development up there. Topanga is very unusual though because if you live in Los Angeles, you could be in Topanga and look like you're in the woods. It's cool. I got gotta say, and then right now it's all greened up. It's beautiful right now. It's spectacular right now. I mean it would trick you if you came here from somewhere else, like, oh my God, this is the most beautiful place ever. When you come back in August, you're like, this is a fire hazard. We gotta get Outta here. Everything's dry. And people were throwing cigarettes out their car. Windows Kenton's this year.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       Yes. Audio files. So when you're driving up the road, you know, we opted to go over the specific coast highway and then come over that way. Um, Adelaide, La and it's like, Oh man, I bet neil young.

Speaker 2:          00:13:25       Yeah, I bet he had. I mean there was a house that was for sale in Topanga. Then I found out about it before it was, it was already sold by the time I found out about it, but it was a house that Jimi Hendrix owned. It's like, fuck, I would buy a house that Jimmy Hendrix owned it. The garbage can that. Yeah. I mean that whole place was just hippies galore up there. It's a really interesting spot.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       Yeah. Oh, six, 21 hr six, 21. Uh, what does hr stand for it? I believe it's house rule, right? Is that right? So now we're going to have to google that up. I'm, I'm not real good on some of the notes here. And we'll get it for us. Six 21 was um, basically to authorize the sale of pre, uh, approved lions. Three point $3, million acres of a federal federally managed land that had been designated as I'm basically disposable, right?

Speaker 2:          00:14:27       No. How did they decide what disposable and what's not? Fantastic? Asked a question

Speaker 1:          00:14:32       I've asked a ton and I don't know. I don't know. I certainly haven't talked to anybody who was on that committee that came up, uh, under Clinton, I believe. Three million acres. Three point three minutes. Seems like a lot of Jesus. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Hr just means it started in the house. Okay. How's the representatives?

Speaker 4:          00:14:52       Hr, and then a six slash 20 slash two. So 6:20 ones off. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:15:00       I pulled it after the backlash and his name is Jason Chaffetz. Is that essays name? Yep. Representative Jason Chaffetz, Utah. And what's crazy is this guy's a hunter and a fisherman. And apparently he took a picture with him wearing Kambo. Hey guys, I'm going to. You will come on and stop attacking me because as soon as people found out about this bill, his comments on his instagram page, we're just overwhelmed with hunters to just took over his instagram comments, you know, and were really upset and some people kept it classy. A lot of people didn't. And I'm sure he felt that. The heat of that. Yes, absolutely. Which is a really interesting like now because of social media because the guys like you guys and I mean there was a million people. The Gritty Bowman Rinella. Uh, I got involved. There's a lot of people involved and there's a lot of different, you know, you look at all the.

Speaker 5:          00:15:49       If you calculate all our followers up of all the different people that were making posts about this, it reaches a lot of people and then it, it gets people who might've been like me before I went with you guys to Montana who just might have been curious. Like, what is this all about? Then you read into it and then you start looking into this public land system that we have and how unique and beautiful it is. And you just go, wow, they want to sell that. And Paul Ryan had proposed that as well, right? Didn't he propose selling it off to pay some, some of the land off to pay for the debt.

Speaker 4:          00:16:18       It's something that comes up all, all too frequently because, I mean, it's, it's, uh, it's something that we've watched, you know, state by state, by state. Um, do you know, it's like you get a bad fire season. I'm all of a sudden you're up to your eyeballs in debt and it's raised taxes or it's sell off some land, sell off some land. So short, shortsighted, you know, when you think about the possibility that this land

Speaker 5:          00:16:44       could not be there for your children or your children's children. Like it's been for us and it's been for our grandparents. I mean it says an amazing system that we have here.

Speaker 4:          00:16:53       And what is her six slash 22 k? So Hr six, 22 is

Speaker 1:          00:16:59       right now. It is very black and white. It's basically to remove, um, federal law enforcement officers, Elios, um, which, um, the blm has its own law enforcement officers. Um, forest service has its own law enforcement officers, um, remove those and then give county law enforcement, uh, the authority to enforce laws on

Speaker 4:          00:17:26       the federally managed lands. Huh. So if their resources are tight, which they are, they probably wouldn't stop poachers. They probably wouldn't do a good job of keeping people of, you know, making a mess out of the place. Yes. And

Speaker 1:          00:17:41       basically what it does is it sets the federal land system up to fail. It's like a booby trap. It's like, alright, now we're going to pull, you know, all this, all these resources out. And then five years later it's like, oh, look what a disaster it is. Now it's moving to state, you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       It's weakening the structure of it to facilitate a collapse. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       And there's nothing, there's nothing against county law enforcement here. The thing is, it's like, you know, you go grab your local sheriff or sheriff's deputy and say, Hey, uh, you know, how many mushrooms can I pull off of this burden on, you know, the siebler national forest. I mean, that guy is going to look at you cross eyed, you know, uh, ask them how many cords of wood you can go up and cut for your fireplace in the winter. You know, the guy's not going to have a clue because it's not, not as job. Bigger fish to fry got totally different laws, right? From federal state for federal versus state and yeah, I mean it's a different job.

Speaker 2:          00:18:40       Now explain to people what is the difference between Blm and the other organizations that control

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       public land. Okay. So beautiful in management. Yeah. So the homestead act or at a go west young man, everybody gets a 140 acres. Um, the uh, so basically we got pushed a lot of people out onto this big open space because uh, you know, the east needed money, so you really need to populate these areas and start the economy rolling again. Um, the basically that area's that failed like a large chunk of the Missouri breaks his block, land management or bureau land management. Um, the areas that failed and were not hospitable became blm ground. And basically the impetus a blm is, um, they're, they're more revenue focused then your forest service lands are so blm, um, is, is more focused towards grazing. Um, so Lisa's like oil and gas grazing

Speaker 2:          00:19:52       and the grazing lease was the big thing with the bundys. That was the big thing up in Oregon where there's a standoff with the rangers and all that jazz, which is fucking chaos

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       chaos. But they owed a ton of money. Yeah. And they didn't, you know, didn't want to pay it. They always a ton of money.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       Yeah, they still do. But how does that work? Because we've been on hunts before, like we were recently with Rinella and crew. We're in Nevada and we're on a mule deer hunt and you know, you'd be stocking on a mule deer. And these fucking cows were everywhere. I mean everywhere. I mean if you were hunting cows, boy you will be gold in like, dude, we're eating good tonight. And cows everywhere. But we were hunting deer. So you have to get away from the fucking cows to get to the deer and the cows that sometimes spook. And then the deer would realize that the cow saw something and they would boil Boeing where the cows are going to come check you out. He would step in cow shit everywhere. And I was like, this is so crazy. How are these, how does this work? And you know, they were trying to explain to me that these people just sort of let these cows wander. And we've found that in Montana as well. Yup. And we just let their cows wander all over the place. Then they round them up.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       Yeah. And that's something. So the, you know, we, the people have, uh, have these programs in place to where we lease that ground. Um, I, I would say more often than not, if not a 100 percent of the time far below market value to uh, you know, the rancher and it's right of first refusal. So the first guy to say, hey, I want to graze my cattle on this property. He's his name is going to be on the lease until he doesn't want it anymore. And it, and it comes up for renewal. And then, um, you know, there's a range land biologists, um, who go out and they say this is how many days and how many, um, you know, animal cow, calf units, um, can be grazed on this area for this long.

Speaker 2:          00:21:53       And doesn't that affect local wildlife as well? Because I would assume if you're having your animals graze on the land, they're eating a lot of stuff that the deer would eat or maybe a lot of the other wildlife would eat. But you gotta keep in mind Ma'am is a tough call. I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       for we are, you know, the, the low lands, it's the antelope and the and the uh, and the antelope and the cows live pretty harmoniously. In fact, a lot of that, you know, if there's a lot of grand day used to a lot of cow feed and you know, it, it could help when done properly it, it works really well because, you know, basically our beef has replaced our bison or buffalo. So there was a major grazer out there prior to the beef being out there. Um, you know, super dance grasslands are good for some things. But, you know, oftentimes your upland birds need open areas, um, uh, for, you know, picking up scratch and it's better for the bugs and a number of reasons. So when that systems respected and done well, um, it's, it's good for everybody or it can be good for everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:23:00       Now, what are your opinions that you, I'm sure you guys are aware of this whole American Serengeti project that they're trying to do in the midwest of this country or in the middle of this country, which is really quite fascinating. They're trying to buy up private land and turn it into what they think was essentially like what America was before people came here.

Speaker 1:          00:23:21       Yes. And I am not, I'm not super studied up on it, but yeah, that is kind of the nuts and bolts of it. And at the end of the day, if it's going to be privately held, and I, I want to say nature concern,

Speaker 2:          00:23:31       American prairie reserve. There it is right there. This is a little piece on it that a jamie just pulled up, but they want to reintroduce bison like wild bison all through out areas. Wyoming, Montana, Wyoming is a bunch of different areas. Right. Where is it?

Speaker 1:          00:23:49       Yeah. Ultimately it's bigger than just being talked about in a number of different states. But yeah, I think it is kind of the traditional, you know, the um, yeah, the kind of the Oklahoma, South Dakota, North Dakota, like the true prairie region there

Speaker 2:          00:24:13       where it used to be like giant herds of buffalo wandering through the land. They want to recreate that and they're also gonna open up block management on that. Right. So this is going to be an area like once it gets established and once there's populations of animals there, then people are going to be allowed to hunt those animals.

Speaker 1:          00:24:29       Yeah. And I mean if, if that's the case, that's great. Like I said, I haven't been super studied up on it, but you know, I mean I love the idea man. I mean

Speaker 2:          00:24:37       translating, you know that they're doing this and buying a private land as right now being used for whatever and they're going to turn it into public land and they're going to allow people to, uh, to go. Then you're going to be able to see like great herds of bison roaming through some of these states. I mean that. That's going to be incredible and that's something we always talk about on this land transfer stuff. You know, once it's gone, it's gone. So if these guys are out there trying to make some more of it. Yeah, I say good on them. They literally are trying to make more public land, which is kinda crazy. What are you going to do about Predator? So they're going to bring in predators. So they're going to bring in wolves and man, if they're going to say that Jim, here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:25:15       Does the APR at 10? Intend to reintroduce predators such as wolves. Grizzly bears, which are historically present in the region as a non. As a private nonprofit organization, American prairie reserve does not have the authority to reintroduce species to the area even at those species were historically present. Species reintroduction falls under the jurisdiction of Montana fish and wildlife parks and slash or the US fish and wildlife service in any decisions regarding the reintroduction of wolves or grizzlies in the region will need to be made by these agencies augmented by the will of the general public. Interesting. Yeah. We're reintroducing grizzlies have tubs. Xcel people like going for it though. Oh, I'd Montana. It's crazy,

Speaker 1:          00:25:55       right? An area that you and I were in Missouri breaks. I mean, that's east of the mountains, right? Right. Um, they every other year, so they catch some loaner. Typically a young male is way out in the prairie and it just looks like he's just kind of naturally getting funneled down in the Missouri breaks, which, you know, as historic range for them. And uh, somewhere along the way he'd gets his hunger, gets the best of them and he knocks over some sheep and that's kind of the end of them. But the same thing, wolves are going to come whether you like it or not.

Speaker 2:          00:26:33       Yeah. How do you guys feel about wolves? Because you guys are in Idaho and Idaho has a really interesting relationship with wolves, whereas a real love hate relationship, like I gotta imagine it's to be cool as fuck to be out at night here.

Speaker 6:          00:26:47       Interesting sets. Amazing. So at first hairstyle banks or was it before you could hunt wolves and before that was it was totally unchecked. It it. The elk hunting sucked

Speaker 2:          00:27:00       as they killed all the up because they came in and didn't know what was going on. They hadn't had wolves there in a long time. Over 100 years and then explain to people that there's a reintroduction of wolves into the yellowstone region in 1990 something or nothing.

Speaker 6:          00:27:13       Maybe it was. I'm not positive when it started, but then

Speaker 2:          00:27:17       voted on either. This is a really controversial subject tomorrow, sportspeople and also among wildlife people. A lot of wildlife people completely support it. They think it balances out the ecosystem and that the undulates, like the elk and the deer were running rampant and they were destroying a lot of the grasses and the plants that would like provide homes for a lot of other animals. And this whole thing was kind of unbalanced,

Speaker 6:          00:27:39       just like with beef man overgrazing bat. Absolutely, but are so, you know, prior to us being able to hunt them and stuff, it was, it, it really was skewed. I had no idea how to deal with the wolf. So for instance, a pack of wolves would come in the bowl, a bowl would go out and try to fend off the wolves and it would just get crushed by the wolves. So, you know, a bull elk, anything. Yeah. Full boil. Right? Right. But now a days after maybe living together for. I mean, I've seen this, it's my happening in my neighborhood, like as we speak, there's wolves in my neighborhood right now. And it literally, you can tell when the wolves around the elk, they pot up kind of, um, kind of get into a circle and they don't try to go out and fight one on one. They'll just sit there and the wolves will kind of come in and they work together. It, you know, and, and it's, it's an interesting, it's an interesting rl cuttings. Quite good. And it, and the elk don't run, don't run. They don't split off. They've kind of figured out this symbiosis, like how to live with wolves. It's, it's an interesting thing that's fascinating

Speaker 2:          00:28:49       because they always did live with wolves, you know, until people came along and. Well in Elvis tradition, elves, what am I talking about? This is where my mind is elk. Traditionally, before people came around, there's a debate as to whether or not they were mountain animals at all. Right? They were probably spent more time

Speaker 6:          00:29:08       store starved going through the Nez perce territory, right? Like they, there are so little game in the mountains when they were out there. That's one of the major arguments for that. But um, yeah, you know, there's, there were animals covering the prairies if, if you believe everywhere to those lyrics, Lewis and Clark,

Speaker 2:          00:29:31       what kind of makes sense if you think about it, because if you see the way they're adapting to wolves and every animal adapts. I mean there's a crazy documentary right now. I mean this is a little bit off topic, but on Netflix rats,

Speaker 5:          00:29:42       it is so fucking disturbing if you haven't seen it, it's amazing. It's called, it's called rat. I've heard about Morgan spurlock, the guy who did supersize, me and a bunch of other documentaries. He created this woo rats, like their gross. Everybody knows her gross, you know, just when they start pulling Paris, I did catch a bunch of rats start polling parasites out and I'm like, well this one will kill you if you have an open wound and this gets on you. You're black. Plague comes from Ras. And they pulled a bot fly out of this one rad that was literally the size of its head. It's just this gigantic thing. And then at the end of it, they kind of explained like one of the guys who's an exterminator explains how smart rats on how much they adapt and what they'll do is if there's poison or if there's traps.

Speaker 5:          00:30:27       They literally the smart rats, the older rats will hang back and they'll let a young, weaker rat go towards the food and you know, he, he gets his fucking head crushed by the trap and they go, Yep, I thought something was fucked up about that. Let's get outta here. And in the union never killed them. All like to be able to kill them all. The most effective method that they were using this documentary was dogs. They had a bunch of terriers. It was all these little cute little dogs, man, little cute little dogs. He would think, oh, a little sweetie. Those little fucking Jack Russell terriers, those little suckers were meant to kill rats. That's why they made them. And they just run after these rats and they're all ripping them apart. He was ruthless and brutal, but it just highlights the adaptation that animals undergo when there's pressure, any kind of pressure makes them adapt and change and they just sort of figure out what the fuck the problem is. The Grand Canyon on the way.

Speaker 4:          00:31:25       I grabbed a. There it is.

Speaker 5:          00:31:27       This is a scene in it. Oh, there we go. Look at those things. Your pith. Oh my God. These little fuckers are monsters, man. They just crushed these rats and they rip them apart like they played tug of war with these rats. It is. This is a, this is not in the movie, right? This is just something else. Just on youtube called riding or riding. Yeah. And this is how they read the countrysides of rats and like really heavy area. They don't eat them though. They just crush them. Well sometimes they eat them in the movie. They were eating some of them. Speaking to the

Speaker 4:          00:31:56       parasite side of things. Kevin and I were cruising down. Uh, where were you last night? See the Kardashians? Ventura Boulevard? No, there is a possum. Cal grabbed positive by the tail. I thought it might have been. I couldn't help myself as possible. I've ever seen a good idea at the time. I've never seen a possum before. I've never seen a boss. How's that possible? You're in the woods 300 days a year. Awesome man. Wow. Yeah, so I grabbed the thing by the tail and because I wanted to see if it played dad. Right, right. The thing, and then immediately I just ran inside wash my hands because I. Oh yeah, I'm in La and I grabbed a pause, pause guides for sure. It's kind of AIDS. So the adaptation is a

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       hundred percent true. Those elk, God punished when the wolves were coming on the scene and they just figured it out and figured out that they got punished by people and they moved into the mountains. They realize, look, these people though, the lazy ones, they want to pull up in their truck and fucking shoot off the hood and just stay away from cars. Let's. Hey guys, let's go up here. That's hard for them to go up here. They get tired is not that much air. Let's go higher.

Speaker 6:          00:33:06       The wolves are super smart. They don't mess around, like if once the bullets started flying they would, you know, they were, you know, you know, there's a wolf quota and rarely in our unit does it get met, you know, so it's

Speaker 2:          00:33:20       explain that to people that are the uninitiated. So what it is is the wildlife biologist, and this is a really controversial topic because when they reintroduced wolves, there was a target population they wanted to reach and they felt like we could reintroduce these wolves. And what's interesting is they got them from Canada and the guy that trapped them that the legend holds, he just found the nastiest, biggest like, oh, you guys want to bring waltz? Because in Canada, like where, where I got this Moose in BC, they have so many wolves that Mike Hawk Ridge, my buddy lives up there, one of his neighbors, they took out a cow and you know, they, they'll just get these big packs and they'll just fucking attack things and roll in it.

Speaker 6:          00:33:58       At least for that. A pack of four small nine of them and. But at one, I'm not like some Wolf Hater, right? No, no, no. By any means, but it's, it is. They are gnarly predators, like I've seen them, you know, kill stuff and it's, I don't know, it's interesting to me how people have this real soft spot for wolves. Like they're amazing creatures and they can do amazing things. They can travel amazing distances but nice they are not and it's not like this furry kind of thing. They're pissed.

Speaker 2:          00:34:30       Well, people think of them as dogs because they look a lot like huskies that we think of them as some beautiful forest creature that lives this natural existence and they do, but they're also fucking ruthless predators and they are the only Predator in North America like that, that size that operates in packs. And that's some scary shit, man. Coyotes kind of do it, but there are a lot smaller and you know, they're, they're more going after rodents and Fonz and little things that they can get ahold of. Wolves will take out a fucking full blown elk. You've come across it kill and it's that thing did not die in any sort of a nice disney sort of way. Boy and amaze back to the front when we were in, um, bc in that place where I was getting to with my friend Mike Hockridge up there. We came across a kill.

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       It was pretty fresh. It was a, a calf, a moose calf, and it was just the, what were the stunning thing about it is first of all, it's pretty fresh. Like you look down at it. Like it probably happened the night before maybe at the very earliest, like a day ago. And it was fucking hair everywhere. Like that's what I didn't expect somehow or another I thought like, like, oh, I didn't expect to see so much hair, but it's like almost like they shaved it and it stays for like a long time. You know, you could come in the next summer and it'll be this big, looked like a carpet well up there in BC where he lives, you can shoot as many walls as you want. There's no quota. The reason beings that there's so many of them, they have to control the population and they're so fucking smart.

Speaker 2:          00:35:58       They're really hard to kill. And so these people that have cows up there and their various farm animals up there, I mean they're constantly under pressure, the constantly the threat of these wolves. And as well as him, Mike shot a wolf that came at him and jumped at him off of a ridge. He was going up a ridge rifle in his hand and he had made some howls, you know, he, he can imitate a wolf's howl. And the wolf saw him and literally was jumping at him and he shot it in the air that has asked me using whole Africa style. Right? He's got this wolf mounted in his house like this with his feet up to remind him of that scene. I mean, that easily could have been the end of him. I mean, he's up there without a, without a gun. That wolf could kill the teamwork aspect. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That would be horrific. They're worse.

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       So we called in a wolf. So yeah, we should go back to like the quota thing, because this is kind of a pet peeve of mine. People look, I try to encourage everybody at the office to go to our local fish and game meetings and the town hall meetings and things that happened there in Ketchum Idaho and I'm the, one of the arguments that came up was just so backwards, but it came from a place of. I can see the logical sequence here, but typically if there's a really, really long hunting season on something, it means that hunters are doing a really bad job of filling their tags. Right. Okay. So if there's a really short season, it typically means that hunters are doing a really efficient job of filling their tags. So we have this very long season on wolves and several people from town stood up the fish and game meeting and said, hey, this is just immoral that, you know, we were putting hunting pressure on wolves for eight months out of the year.

Speaker 1:          00:37:55       And the truth of the matter is, is hunters, myself included, are doing a very, very poor job of putting a tag on these things. And I've, I've called him one in our area and it was an absolutely amazing experience. But uh, you know, basically are south facing slopes are wide open or north facing slopes are heavily timbered and I could hear the wolf calling below my, a friend of mine, Jim is an amazing shot, a old retired forest service dude. And he got set up for the shot. I'm calling it the wolf. As the wolf's coming up the mountain all the sudden starts making noises that I just cannot make. So I kinda knew I was screwed. Right. But it was the vocal range is unbelievable. I would look just like barks and woofs like Wolf's growls. Like it just sounded like this thing was getting more and more pissed off. The closer it got to us. And that was my job, right? I was like, I'm going to make this thing so pissed that it just keeps coming and Jim's going to get a shot at it. And that thing broke the tree line probably 500 yards, made it at a dead sprint, about 60 yards from the timber all the sudden hit the brakes, turned around was gone. And that is the closest I've ever gotten to killing a wolf. And Idaho. And sought for maybe a second. Now

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       there's a lot of people that are listening to this go, why the fuck would you want to kill a wolf man? You know what do you go to? Little Duke. Duke doesn't work. You know that law? That's a big one always comes up is your Dick's small man. You want to kill a wolf? What I think is lost on people who don't encounter walls or who don't understand the science behind wildlife management is that there is nothing else that's going to control their population. It's only going to be people. They're going to survive through the winter and they're going to eat as many elk as they can, as many deers, many whatever the fuck they can get ahold of as they can. And especially since they have this kind of crazy headstart before the animals figured out that they were there because they'd never been there. And over 100 years since they were extricated from the American southwest and the, you know, what they had done was with wolves. They had shot like horses, like wild horses. Then injected them with strychnine. Right? And then they had shot like an Alpha wolf and rubbed his scent and his glands all over the meat so that the other wolves knew that he had been there. So they thought it was okay to eat that stuff. And so they would eat it. They would get the strict nine and they would die. And they, it was a mass kill off this wolf. Yeah. Yeah. Judas Wolf. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:32       Yeah. Yes. So yeah, there is management, right. And the thing is like, one of the hottest topics in our area was um, in the winter, especially a heavy winter right now, all your game animals get congregated in lower elevations, typically on these south facing slopes and get a lot of sun heavy winters like we're experiencing right now. These animals are basically pushed into that farm and ranch country. And those operators down there are feeding their winter livestock and the wolves and the coyotes are writing on top everybody in calving seasons right now. So then you get a, typically a very large, um, did rate. Yeah. Mortality rates by spikes because you got animals that are in distress and there's, you know, after birth from the birthing process everywhere you got easy pickins on the cabs and a hunters aren't knocking these down. So the state and you know, like a cattleman's association, we'll go together and fun helicopter gunning. So Ariel gunning to go out there and shoot those animals. So, um, you know, uh, I, I would love to hear the tiny dick argument. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       well, he goes, go a tiny dude. Why would you want to kill a wolf there? Beautiful, magnificent creatures. And they are. But it's important to recognize that there have historically been gigantic problems with wolves and people. That's where all the Little Red Riding Hood Shit comes from the wolves in Paris story. I'm sure you're aware of that story from the 14 hundreds where they killed like 40 people in Paris. That Paris has wolves in it again. Do you know that? No. Yes, they're, the people are being told. There was an article about it recently where people are being told to not fear the wolves that are in the streets of fucking Paris because they're only looking for four legged. Pray like these fucking people. Don't remember this story from the 14 hundreds, this historical story where the people of Paris had to gather together with fucking spears and quarter these wolves and killed them in a town square.

Speaker 2:          00:42:40       It's an amazing story. Now. How much of it, you know, obviously when you're dealing with something from 1400, there's no film, so we don't know how much of this is accurate, but it's a historical story that they had to kill a ton of wolves and I'm sure you guys know about the story from World War One. The Russians and the Germans had a ceasefire because so many of them were getting killed by wolves in Russia. They decided, let's go kill these fucking wolves. Then we'll go back to killing each other. I had never heard that. He never heard. It's a great story. It's a great story. I think.

Speaker 6:          00:43:10       I mean the populous at large, what they, I think will benefit the most from it. There's people on extreme lovers and extreme haters, but in the middle there is somewhere in the middle there's a right thing to do and I think that the government definitely puts their best foot forward, the scientists and whatever to figure out that balance, you know, and I think that to say that, you know, we need to have, you know, 10,000 wolves in Idaho is naive because that would happen for, for instance, if they were just let you know, for procreate at will. So you know, these people are trying to be good, right? That's the, that's why they're calling them. That's why you know that that's why they're reintroduced him to create a balance, you know? And I think that that's, that needs to be realized both sides. Oh sorry,

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       both sides. People that don't want any wolves to die, they don't want Wolf's die because wolves are amazing. And then wildlife is amazing. It's totally. Well, you can go to yellowstone and I went to summer and you'd go and see a herd of buffalo just chilling on this field, like, you know, and I was there with my kids and I was giving him, the buyer knows they're staring at these buffalo and they're only like 100 yards away and I'm like, this is amazing. [inaudible] like, and my kids were like, those are wild. I'm like, those are wild. They go wherever they want and like that's like in their head, like that's a wild. That does just giant, furry fucking star wars beast. It's a wild ever forget it. They'll never forget it. Yeah. Do you mean it was sinking in their head to the, this is wild, you know, because it's one thing if you see something behind a fence and you go, oh, that's a cow. You know, we're at a farm, that's a cow. And I'm like, no honey. Those things live in the woods. They go wherever they want. There's no boss, no one tells them what to do. They just do whatever they want.

Speaker 6:          00:44:49       Totally. Well, coming full circle, like the whole wild thing is that, you know, with public lands people get to have these crazy wild experiences. I e by hunting like there's very little things that you can do where you go out and it's, it's raw, right? Things can go sideways and you know, you can get caught out that I'm in. It's, it's, it's, it's a unique thing to be able to do, to see these experience, this wild stuff

Speaker 2:          00:45:16       mean by get caught out there. It's like you could go somewhere and the weather can turn ugly and you can get snowed in, get lost in the fucking mountains. Yeah. People die every day. Bob a Bobcat goldthwait had a really fun video, a movie rather than he did called Willow Creek about and the, the, the, the movie was about all the different people that get lost in the woods and his movie was saying that big foot was eating them. Right. Pretty ridiculous. But there is it. Your is it, but it was fun. But bobcat is a nut. He's, he's a big foot fanatic. I was like, I was trying to tell them from people that actually go to the woods, you know, many hunters see big foot zero, zero. It's zero. How many get hit by cars? Zero. Fucking zero. How many get caught on trail cams? Fuckin zero and got. That's the other thing. Like with the, the number of trail cams that exist today in the woods. I put people put up to scout to try to find out where the animals are and then on top of that, the number of phones that people have that have cameras on them has gone through the roof. But the bigfoot sightings have shrunk. There's way less of them. Interesting. And you to my big foot and it was last time you saw a ufo video and fucking non or non our area magic.

Speaker 4:          00:46:29       He's gonna see a Ufo. You could. We have zero light pollution. Red The qualities. Insane. Oh, you guys must have like crazy skies at nine, huh?

Speaker 2:          00:46:44       Yeah. You guys must have beautiful

Speaker 4:          00:46:46       skies on rail. So we're. I mean the office is just under 7,000 feet and then within 20 minutes of the office you can climb to 11,000 feet. Wow. Try breathing up. There is a. it's difficult. Bring one of these kettlebells up there and get yourself a workout. You feel good, you feel good, and then you have, you know, a couple days worth of stuff on your back and your like your wife that you have to drink so much water. When there's high altitude. What's that about? Just dry. Generally speaking are we are just low humidity and deep breathe. You know, every time you breathe out you breathe out a little water, right? Yeah. That's what the mist is. When you see people at and it's cold

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       and stuff that's coming out of your mouth, that's actually water vapor and it exists all the time. You just don't see it because there's not a big difference in the temperature, which means your body in the air like it is when it's really cold out. I think that's why people are more hung over the mountains. Certainly my excuse. Yeah. Well I got to be because you're dehydrated too. Which is the big factor in being hung over in the first place. Right, exactly. Like the people that are pros. They'll pound booze and they'll have a fucking jug of water. A buddy of mine drank with John Claude van Damme and he said, uh, this is like way back when John Claude van Damme was a big movie star doing all these big movies. He said he would do booze and he had a fucking gallon of water with him. He brought like a milk jug size gallon filled with water.

Speaker 2:          00:48:14       So you do a shot and fucking chug the water. Like it was really consciously Busan, which I've never seen anybody do before. That's oozing. That's a guy that's going, look, I'm not going to stop being a degenerate. I'm going to take care of my body in the process. He comes to catch into years two and we'd hear stories about looseness, but I don't, I've never witnessed it myself looseness, you know, go into the bars and getting loose. Getting party in. Yes. It gets crazy and catch him. Apparently he used to throw side kicks off the roof and shit.

Speaker 1:          00:48:49       Yeah. You know, shots for everyone. First time I ever heard a wolf, and this goes back to like the hair on your arms stand up. Um, I was working with a buddy of mine and the Frank Church wilderness, or is that just straight north to catch them? It's the largest contiguous wilderness in the lower 48. Really? Yeah. It's huge. And it tried to get people to. Right. We tried to force people in there to mine and Pharma and it just didn't take. So there's old homesteads and stuff and there's some eerie stuff like the Missouri breaks. Yes. Yeah. Very, very similar. This is just kind of a grander scale. I'm much more timber and stuff. Your guys' first experience out there, I think I still think about that because that was, I would love to put some of these like land transfer people out there on that same trip. Oh yeah. These guys showed up. It was like 34 degrees trying to snow. Mostly just rain overcast grace guys. Perfect. Nothing Mary about it. Yeah, it was awesome. Worse temperature to deal with. Well then it, it got

Speaker 2:          00:49:50       done like nine, you know, it was getting real cold, right? It was fucking awesome, man. It was awesome because it's just, it's one of the things about being in the real wilderness is how like beautiful but lonely it is. It's kind of lonely. There's something weird about it. Like you could die and it doesn't give a fuck. You have this illusion like if you died right here, if you had a heart attack and toe over, we'd all be bummed out. Like God, we lost Ryan Callahan. I can't believe it man. And you know, we'd be bummed out, but the woods wouldn't give a fuck. You would just, you'd fall dead and everything go. The, the humble, the feeling of humility and the feeling of insignificance is so overwhelming and unavoidable that it's just this intense realization of your piece. Like where you are as a person, where you fit in in this grand, gigantic Mandalah of life. And it's like it's an

Speaker 6:          00:50:50       find the for the further. You go back, you know, and you know your full day plus walk away, you know, or you get dropped off somewhere. You know, it's like, Whoa, we're here. You know, it's, it's a. it's a cool feeling though. That's the whole thing, right? You're outside of your comfort zone. That's what makes it so pleasurable.

Speaker 2:          00:51:08       My friend Adam Green tree went on a do it yourself hunt in Montana and archery, elk hunt and he went, I think he went at least 12 miles in the. Might've went more by himself, shot an elk big fucker. Oh, did out by himself. Four days, four days a pack out. So he's got 100 pounds on his back and he's got to walk 12 miles back and forth for four days to get this elk out.

Speaker 1:          00:51:36       That's heavy for folks who don't know, that is four days of misery for days and looking around and

Speaker 2:          00:51:43       whistling through the woods and he's in decent shape. Me, he works out a little bit, but he's not campaigns, you know, he's not like some fucking crazy marathon, ultra runner. He's not as job to be fit. I mean, he's a professional bowhunter hunter and he's got a mining job in Australia and this. The other thing, he lives in Australia, so even though he brought all that meat back, he couldn't even take it home. He could only eat what he had here in America and then donate it. Yeah, you can't bring it back to Australia. They don't allow that shame. Australian Customs. They won't allow you to meet your trips.

Speaker 1:          00:52:13       So let's say it did a little bit of meat and his entire camp out on the first trip. That's three loads of just meat. Eighty pounds load. Yeah, I mean that guy brought out a lot.

Speaker 2:          00:52:25       He brought it all back. You brought it all back over four days. But they described it like how brutal the experience was by himself shooting this animal. And then he called a buddy, um, to uh, to help him. And this guy helped him pack out a little bit.

Speaker 1:          00:52:41       Imagine your bones laying there on the prairie in eastern Montana. There's a good chance because hunters do the same thing, right? And Game Kinda does the same thing. Generation after generation generation. Think about you tip over dead. There's a very good chance in that country. There's probably like a cro or sue set of bones underneath you. Maybe somebody's horse. Bison antic was all stacked up underneath, you know, it does not give a fuck. Doesn't give as well. Any of bones out there. You just joined in the pile

Speaker 2:          00:53:17       and there's a whole system. Like the idea of waste is ludicrous. You know, like if anything the dies, it's not going to waste. Like you're not going to waste your dog dies out there. It's not going to waste something will eat it. And it is. That is the whole system. There is A. I mean it doesn't seem like it to you as a person. You like, you're not supposed to eat fluffy. He's my dog. No, that's a dog and the dog is an animal and an animal that dies. There is a whole system in place for handling that for sure. I mean from the wolf and the Fox is they'll come in and the birds and then in the bacteria bugs everything and it'll be gone. It'll be down to bones and then eventually something will eat the bones.

Speaker 4:          00:53:57       Did you take the picture of the artery bulb? I posted this year, had just left the face on and then took all the meat off.

Speaker 2:          00:54:05       You did an amazing job. That's so important to post too because you didn't waste an ounce of that meat. You cut every in between the ribs, you know, you were. I mean, and people were commenting on that photo like that is the respect that you give an animal when you hunt it and you shoot it. That's the right way to end.

Speaker 4:          00:54:21       Yes. Now the reality and I think so too. And I, I try to go above and beyond.

Speaker 2:          00:54:28       Yeah. I'm an organ meat guy too. I love heart and liver. I got a need. I'm going to start with tongues this year.

Speaker 4:          00:54:34       I was thinking about your liver. Oh Dude. I had. That was the worst thing to be vocal about ever. I used to. I used to get called up all the time, like, Hey, I got a tongue for you because I know you like him right now. It's just overwhelmed with tongues. Everybody keeps their time and they keep their tongue out of the bag. It is, but you will love it. But, um, the thing is like, yeah, you should take every single thing, but there are little things to get wasted and like the rib meat chunks, especially later in the season when there's not a lot of fat on these animals, like if it's, if it's going to take you some time to get out, that's the stuff that's going to get super dry it out right before you can even make something out of it. So, um, you were saying about liver. Oh yeah. So you made a comment that you eat a lot of liver. Yeah. Like is that, is that a typical la dish?

Speaker 2:          00:55:31       No, no, no, no, it's me just organ meats really good for you. It was so high in vitamins and iron. It's just. And it's just something about, it just feels good when I'm eating it, you know, that's all I had read about wolves that wolves. Like that's one of the ways that they, um, that they established the alpha. The alpha is the one that eats the deliver. When he killed, when they kill an animal, the Alpha immediately leads to liver. Yeah. Yeah. There was this guy that was living with wolves and he had these wolves sort of convinced that he was a wolf and a, it was, he was a wildlife biologist and a both expert, and I forget where this was, that he was doing it, but it was a whole documentary on it. And, but one of the things that they never cry wolf, I don't remember the name of it, unfortunately.

Speaker 2:          00:56:12       Maybe Jamie can find it. But one of the things that this guy did was he would put a liver in a downed animal, like they would kill an animal, place it put, uh, a liver in it and would eat the liver in front of the other wolves so that he would be the dominant male. And where he got fucked up is he had to leave because it's a wolf expert. There was a farmer that was being inundated by wolves. So they had set up this whole way to keep the wolves away from this guy's property without killing them. And one of the things that they did was they set up all these speakers and they projected the sounds of these alpha wolves with these giant speakers. So like, look, bitch, there's a new fucking king just moved into town. Everybody get the hell away from these sheep.

Speaker 2:          00:56:52       And they set up these big ass speakers all over and it worked. But it took a long time to keep these wolves away like a couple of months. And so when he came back then there was a new alpha that had taken his place and he wanted to kill him. And it's a horrific scene where this guy is standing there whimpering in front of this wolf and this huge wolf is in front of him bearing his teeth. And just thinking at any minute, this wolf is just going to tear this guy's fucking face off. This real. Oh yeah. It's 100 percent real. Yeah, it's 100 percent real. It's gnarly. When the wolfs in front of me and he's like, and he's got to hope that this wolf does not decide to attack him. That shows him mercy. Yeah. He established a friendship with this wolf and he was the Alpha, the point where it's going to accept the changing of positions and he has to show no resistance to this change.

Speaker 2:          00:57:42       So it's a really critical moment in his fucking life man, because it might end right there with that wolf in a bad way. I mean, you know, everything's happy when there's food around. So if, if late in the season and food scarce, that would be a tough proposition of. Yeah. Yeah. Early in the season when everybody's happy, that's calves on the ground. Easy pickins. Yeah. I was reading this article about bears and this one region of Alaska, whereas this salmon run and it's a. We had a video of it where there's a guy, I'm sure you've seen the video because it's a famous video where this guy is sitting there, he's got a little lawn chair and they're taking photographs of the bears and this fucking Volkswagen bus with hair walks up to him and just hangs out and there's no danger. There's no fear because it's bear.

Speaker 2:          00:58:32       It's fat and there's a salmon everywhere. And as the guy pans away, he, he, he goes, get out of here, bear and the bear, the bear leaves. But I mean it's fucking 1500 pound bear. It's an enormous. People even get how big they are until you're right there, you probably can't know. But as this guy pans away, you see that there's just like a dozen bears and this one area and they're so well fed this store, this area historically has an incredibly low incident or low rate of attack. There's like almost no attacks by bears on people in this one area. This is it. Food is food is the deal. Look at that fucking thing. Oh yeah. You can sit in this one too. I mean that is, that's a tanker. Oh, we did. We contacted you. Get Ahold of Adam about that fucking TV.

Speaker 2:          00:59:20       I told them to contact you. Did he contact? Okay. Places TV. August decides. That fucker just decides to sit down behind you. This TV sucks. He's cutting out. Yeah. So he's. This guy has to chase his bear off. But now look, as the bear goes over, whatever it means, got a big fat belly and you turn and you look down at the river and it's just overrun. Look behind you. Look behind you. Fuck that TV. Let's see. Be such a piece of shit. But look behind you. Look at all those little bears. I mean, that's insane. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14 bears in just this limited perspective. And this guy's taken photos of them because it's just. And there's more, there's just overrun, just overrun with fish.

Speaker 4:          01:00:04       We were fishing up in Prince Wales up Steve's fish shack. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, uh, we had his little boy in the canoe, so there's three of us in the canoe and we had, it was high tide and we paddled away up this creek and there were six black bears in this creek that's as wide as this room and we're just sitting in the canoe and we kind of pushed the, the bow of the canoe on the stick. So it hold us in place. And Steve's kid, you know, being a kid, he's like bears or bad bears are scary. It's like, what are we doing here? But you could watch these bears take turns and there was one lane in this creek and as the salmon would, the water's dropping right at the tide's going out. So the salmon would come up the bear weight for one to be easy, grab it, walk into the woods. The next barrier would come down, lay in the same spot, and just wait. So it was like a line. There was a food line and everybody was totally cool with each other.

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       We're all going to get some plenty of food. No conflict. I mean, isn't that the same with people? Yeah. It's like kind of universal amongst all species as resources get scarce. Shit gets weird. Yeah, I mean and that, that is one of the things that's sort of important to bring up when people are talking about wolves and predators and populations. Like you can't ensure that these things are going to have an adequate food supply, especially as their numbers grow higher and higher. It's, it's a really controversial subject in it. I think the one thing that people don't understand from the outside that really don't understand the whole idea of hunting predators, they, I feel like really kind of have to be there. I feel like you kinda have to like almost be just really involved in that whole ecosystem. Just be there physically to kind of get it to you.

Speaker 6:          01:02:00       I think that's probably accurate. I think it would be almost odd to be like, I'm going to go shoot some animal. You've never seen no. Nothing. You know what I mean? That would be, there's a certain cruelty to that, but maybe, maybe not, I don't know. But once you're, once you've seen the cycle, like in person, it kind of, I don't know, it brings everything together if you will. You see like, you know, wow, that's interesting that you know, that they're um, you know, that they're around now and I hopefully don't get too many of them, but you know, maybe it's a good thing and maybe, you know, certainly in our unit things are. Elk are fine.

Speaker 2:          01:02:36       Well, balance is so super important, which is one of the reason why places like New Zealand or so odd because they brought over imprint incredibly odd. They brought over all these animals and the what is like the 18 hundreds, the Europeans brought them over England and brought them over. Is that what it was even earlier than that?

Speaker 6:          01:02:53       Earlier in that all the way to say thank God. I think Roosevelt gave him a Canada geese and the Mallard duck and like 19. Oh five or something like that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       So what they did was they brought all these animals over there with no predators at all and so they have wild stags and these red deer and all these different animals that are not native and they're overrun to the point where they have to do helicopter runs, unfucking stag. They have to fly over and

Speaker 6:          01:03:26       poison poison a whole valley because the possums or whatever go crazy, you know? And there's nothing left to control it. It's nuts. And you gotta think the thinking was no predators, this is going to be great. Everybody's gonna get along and it's going to be. And we'll have food.

Speaker 2:          01:03:40       Well the idea was that New Zealand was going to be an exotic hunting ground for the wealthy. It was going to be like a Texas ranch for. Yes, yes. They were going to come over and they were going to jolly good time. I'm going to go hunt a stag and they would go over there. And so they put these animals there, but then they just, there's nothing killing them other than people. And so they're just fucking like crazy. And making baby stags and just, whew. This is a parties. Plenty of food. It's all lush and green. It rains like crazy. So there's plenty of food. Beautiful. Stunning.

Speaker 6:          01:04:15       Kenton has been over there. I have not made it. Yeah. Did you hunt over there? It wasn't like, it was cool. We just kind of went over there and met our, uh, our, some of our wool growers and they rented a helicopter and they kind of dropped us off in the middle of nowhere. And so. So we'll see in a couple days. Yeah, exactly. They could drop stuff on top of this hill. We, I was ready to get out of the bird, frankly, it was like crushing snow and I mean I've been in helicopters a solid amount and I don't love them and I was like, I'll walk back, like, let's get down. So we got down and you know, and just made our way out. Ended up shooting a really nice shammy was really wild looking animals wild. Yeah. I mean we didn't even know like how big anything. We're just out there and we're like, how does the Shammy shot? Those are native to that area, you know? No, we took it apart and pet, you know, put all the meat and everything and started walking out and almost left the head there. Then like, let's bring the head, you know, it turns out some, you know, it was like a sci goal. It would never seen one before. They're all so small, you know, they taste phenomenal.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       So that night we got sci. Gold is always trying to say like the size of it. It was like a trophy size down. That's what I mean. And it was, which I thought was just how they fund all that stuff. They do it in gold, they have like silver inches, but then it puts you into a different category. So it's like a 400 inch elk or a 200 inch white tail. Like there's this. Yes. Just No. Yeah, like a number that very few people ever achieve. Right? Yes. But it was um, I don't know. I'm not a huge number. Of course I like to pay attention, but whatever. But um, it's super yummy. Shammies like super good. What does it taste like? Just kind of tastes like, I dunno, like lamb. I would say a cross between like a lamb under the good white tail.

Speaker 4:          01:06:04       Look at that thing. What a weird animal, isn't it? Wow. And they're everywhere. Whenever I see a big fat guy with a dead animal with a rifle, I feel like there's something wrong there. Yeah. How does that guy get up there? You know, I feel like you should. I mean, this is totally ignorant on my part and very biased, but I feel like you should have to be in shape to kill something that lives up there. When I see a fat guy that figures out a way how to do it, and I'm like, all right, that's a short rope. Damn short. Roped with. Sent me up. Like when guys climb everest that are not fit, they'll have a guide that just basically short puts a short rope on and basically. Yeah, yeah. Holy Shit. Yeah. Aggressive guiding. What is it? What the fuck is wrong with someone that doesn't get fit and want to climb everest? I just think that they have no idea what it's like to be above 8,000 meters. Like they might sit there and go on the treadmill every single day and I don't. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:07:03       Meters is what's really important because 8,000 feet sucks at east. I lived, when I lived in Boulder, we were at 8,500 feet and I would do my kettlebell routine at 8,500 feet and it was just like, was like trying to like run through water. It was like, Jesus Christ, this is hard to do. It was incredibly hard to do so much more difficult than it is to do at sea level. I couldn't imagine went 8,000 meters is like

Speaker 4:          01:07:27       narrow. It's like three percent. I think you lose something like three percent efficiency every thousand feet. You come down to sea level and feet every thousand thousand meters, you're talking about 24,000, 25, 26,000 feet and it's insane. It's insane. It's insane. Then you come down to sea level and for me I'm like, ah, running's pointless. This is been running for a while now. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:50       Yeah. That was one thing that I noticed when I did live up there for, it was only like for four months, but when I'd go down to sea level, I felt like I could fucking run through walls. Yes, I can now I get why those guys like train at elevation and then go and fight at sea level because that's a big thing with fighters. A lot of them were trained in Denver or up here that go to big bear.

Speaker 4:          01:08:08       Sure. It goes away fast though. It literally like you're, you acclimate here probably back. I don't know. It seems like not

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       five days in your, you know, it takes the same when you go back up though, if you've been at sea level for a while, you go back up. It takes awhile before you're kind of. Yeah, I think, yeah, I think they say that the best way to do it is actually to train at low altitude, but to live at high altitude so [inaudible] you could put in more work so like you go down for the training, like say if you were next to big bear, you would drive down and then train it like you know, wherever down there and then bust your ass and San Bernardino or whatever and then go back up the hill and sleep and eat and do all your stuff at high altitude. So where your high workload is like for the maximum efficiency of your training because you could get a 100 reps in it will elevate.

Speaker 2:          01:09:01       Exactly. Get more work in. You can do more work. You can and you can do it also for fighting. It's super important to not be tired while you're doing certain technical work like you, you're going to be certain amount of tired, but you don't want to be exhausted because your brain doesn't work, right? No, you drop your hands, you develop shitty skills. You, you start making errors in your technique and those errors and you technique will manifest themselves under pressure. So it's like one of the things about fighting is it's super important that you do everything in training exactly how you would do it if your fucking life depended on it. And if you don't, you're going to pay a price like guys who slack off in training. They almost never become champions. I mean, unless you're some physical freak who can get away with it.

Speaker 2:          01:09:43       The reality is in order to compete against likeminded people that are also phenomenally fit and motivated and understand the consequences of not being fit and motivated and well trained, you have to do everything right. And especially now like mma, you can get away with a lot. When I started, uh, doing commentary in 1997, you could get away with a lot because it wasn't not a lot. I mean just the level of competition just was not the same as it is now. But now the people are so good that the margin of error is so small. The difference between victory and defeat is so small that it's just so much high level activity going on in mma fights that you can't, you can't fuck around and anywhere where your nutrition with your recovery, with your, you know, like all the different things that you're doing outside of training, like cryotherapy or floating or all these different things that people do.

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       Sauna, it's another thing that a lot of guys do. All those different things are like hugely import because these little tiny edges but also technique like your technique has to be efficient and it has to be correct so that in the heat of the moment you, you're, you never think of doing things wrong because you've never done anything wrong. Every time you're training, you're doing things correctly and that might not even save. You still might get head kicked, so you're basically, you're, you're at when you're at your worst, you're still the best yet. Well, there's no, that's the problem. The best fluctuates when you're dealing with like world championship level, right? Like say like a division, like say the UFC is 170 pound division, very competitive division, so competitive that the last title fight resulted in a draw and one of the first draws. There's only three draws and the history of the UFC and title fights.

Speaker 2:          01:11:22       So this fight lines have been a draw and then there's a bunch of other guys fuck. And just straight killers waiting in the wings to have their shot at the title. So in any given day one of these guys might be able to be one of those guys, like one of these guys comes in a little bit sick as a little bit of a cold from training or maybe they're breaking up with their girlfriend or heads a little fucked up, which happens a lot. Yeah. It was like, stay away from the ladies. Ah, that's bullshit. Yeah. Sometimes sometimes it's actually better to have sex because then you're not thinking about sex, you know, but everybody hasn't really seen mindset all the time ran. It's like, yeah, you got to be off the ladies if you're going to train. A lot of fighters do think that though, like a Hixon Gracie was one of the greatest Jujitsu fighters were all time.

Speaker 2:          01:12:06       He wouldn't have sex for like months, months out. Now. Andre's just furious to be a Mike Tyson. Mike Tyson would get his dick sucked right before he knocked someone the fuck out. He didn't give a shit. He was like that. Both you and I'm here for. I'm like, here's a great quote. Mike Tyson has a great quote. He said, uh, if a god invented anything better than pussies, keeping it to himself so he would have sex like right before he fought and just destroy everybody. So an interesting put that in perspective. It doesn't make any sense. He's not known to be a wordsmith either. That's actually not the most educated guy obviously, but not a stupid man and any by any stretch of the imagination. I heard that show. He did, it was fantastic. I heard it's amazing. I never got a chance to see it that uh, I saw the documentary, but I never saw the live show is live show is supposed to be amazing.

Speaker 2:          01:12:55       Oh, you did a standup show. Sort of. Yeah, like a, just a story of his life. Yeah. It's supposed to be just insane. Everybody that has seen it said you got to see it. It's amazing. That's cool. Yeah. But anyway, sex for him. Yes. He would have the sex. It's not for everybody. It's just. I mean it's certainly lower your testosterone a little bit, but I mean if you're fit and prepared, it might relax you where you get a good night's sleep, you know, because that's one of the things about these guys is like anxiety, staying up late, you know, just trying to get your shit together, making sure you get a good night's sleep so you could, you don't get sick. Don't let the. Don't be overwhelmed by the pressure of the moment. It's a lot going on. Helia and you know, you've, once you've introduced the possibility of just getting the shit kicked daddy, that raises the anxiety significantly. Sure. That now think about the anxiety of releasing a perfect arrow on a beautiful animal. You know, there's a lot of anxiety involved in that and it's something that people on the outside, I've heard people say ridiculous things when it comes to hunting, but one of the most ridiculous things that people have to say is, you know, there's no skill involved in that. All you're doing is you're shooting a defenseless animal like do you, you have no idea. You don't know what you're talking about. It's insanely difficult.

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       It's so difficult to keep your shit together and that moment. And if you're a person who is compassionate and who understands the consequences of wounding an animal and what's what's at stake here, and you know, the responsibility of making a perfect shot and in a clean kill is very anxiety filled moment.

Speaker 1:          01:14:32       Absolutely. And I'll tell you right now, you know, I've been around a lot of death. I'm not necessarily by my hands, but you know, doing the guidance gig and stuff like that. Um, I, I did not ever think I was susceptible to that anxiety of being behind the trigger because I'd been around it so, so much. So what I'm trying to say is once you get that skill to be column behind the trigger or on the string, if you're releasing an arrow, it's not necessarily something that's going to stay with you. Right. It's not an automatic deal because I missed the largest mule deer in my life this year with a rifle that really art. No. Where's Neil dear? I've ever seen no bigger than the one that you killed with Steve. Yes. That's insane. That was massive. That one that Steve killed was huge. How has it bigger this thing, man? I just don't. We hiked for a two and a half days. My Buddy, uh, Kayla reared and he's the to boiled out your mule deer skull. A, your Montana animal. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:15:34       we, I mean we hiked for two and a half days. He and he and his wife were having a baby. So we were like, got to make this happen because we're not going to happen next. How far in did you guys go? We were, um, seven miles probably. Um, so you're going over and under over elevation climbing mountains. Yeah. Basically, you know, a big river crossing, um, big climb, try to follow a major drainage up, couldn't find anything or found very, very little. Um, just nasty, nasty country. Finally find one mule deer, fond sunsetting. There's a meal, have your phone on this ridge line. I'm like, well, let's just camp here because we have to leave the next day. But that's the only sign, a little life that we saw. Whoa. And so we camped and tyler's all fraught because he's got this. I thought this would work out. It was his spot wasn't my spot. And uh, the next morning we get up and just stare at this hillside. Kaylee leaves to go take a shit. And yeah, four hours later there's a buck crosses and I can't get a range on my range finder. It's too far away and I'm just pissed at the whole situation. Kyler comes over and he's like, hey, I found some deer, and uh, we slipped around and in this tiny little you had to be there. It something you could see

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       from two miles away. You had to like stumble into this pocket. There were seven bucks chasing one doe, seven year old yearbooks, Jason Window, and we're looking at these deer and we were so far in it. Typically you're just not going to shoot a buck for me. When you're that far in m and a,

Speaker 2:          01:17:32       when you mean when you say a buck for me, you mean a small book. A smaller book is you've put out so much effort, you would like to get an older, mature animal when you're that far in the course kind of exceptionally. Right. Exactly. But for people to, for the uninitiated, which a lot of people listening to this are that meet buck, you would think of like a young fork. Buck doesn't have big antlers. So you're talking about you're looking for a big mature animal looking for a big contract animal, which is a difficult challenge. It's, there's a lot involved in an animal like that and it's also an animal that most certainly as bread, yes, spreads genes and so it's a good animal to take out of the gene pool to allow other animals to also breed

Speaker 4:          01:18:10       and in fact this is the only dear only buck in that group that was going the complete opposite direction, so everybody else, all his buddies were on that doe following her and he was gone the opposite direction. Smart. He's like, listen bitch, I ain't got no time for these fucking games. You find me hooker. Good luck. Good luck, honey. Yeah, it would probably fucking drove his Ferrari over the top of the hill, seal it and my whip be over here in my mansion and a man. I had this thing dead to right. I mean a shot I can make any day of the week and I missed that thing at 90 yards with a rifle. Did you punch? Was it offhand? Oh No. I have a beautiful rest at no excuses and I just lost your trigger. Shit, man. Don't know. I know exactly. I mean, I had, I mean it was, I've been in this situation a lot like okay, fears, undercover, he's going to step into this opening.

Speaker 4:          01:19:08       I had had a round in the chamber finger was off the trigger. I was just waiting for him to step into that opening. Cross hairs were there. As soon as his nose came into the scope, I pulled the trigger and went right in front of them. Yep. Oh, you panicked. Oh, I've lost it because he was just, you saw those antlers. I just, I never even looked at the buck through my binoculars because I knew. I just knew how big it was. How big, how do you think he was? If you had to guess, like inches wise? I would say once in two lifetimes. Like I will never see a deer like a to 90. It was like one of those Arizona's trip bucks for me. Yes. For me, yes. But I would say it was well over over well over the 2:20 mark was wasn't my

Speaker 2:          01:19:53       for people don't know what that means. That's a, that's like me with my arms out. Like that's how big the antlers are.

Speaker 4:          01:20:01       If you see that thing, that is that there should be a lot of. For me, there's a of misery and seeing that

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       thing for it should be a, a major pat on the back because that's just something nobody gets to see. Yeah. It's super rare, right. To for them to get that big. That's genetics age. That's a wise animal. There's a lot involved certainly in that unit. Yes. Yeah. I mean it was just so over the counter unit. Yep. Which means that for people, the uninitiated, you just. You don't. For a lot of places like where I just said the Arizona Strip, the Arizona Strip is like this legendary area that borders between Utah and Arizona and it has these monster mule deer and it like every year they pull these just insane deer out. They've got over 300 inches, which is just, it's like the one 10th of one percent of the world's population of deer. It's just so rare to see an animal this big and this one area consistently produces these animals, so it's really hard to get a tag there really hard.

Speaker 2:          01:21:02       Like you could put it in for 20 years and still not get it. What that means is there might be thousands and thousands of people. They are. There are thousands of people that have putting in for a tag there and they might pick a very small amount. Very, very small amount. Yes. So this was like an animal for there and this is something like, like I said, no excuses. We shoot a ton. We have a reloading bench in the basement. We shoot our bows in the basement of the office. We have multiple shooting facilities that we can go to within 15 minutes of the office. Spend a ton of time behind the trigger. Do you have a process that you do in your mind, like when you see an animal in your about to pull the trigger? Do you have like a thing that you do? Yeah, because they say that that's a good thing to have.

Speaker 2:          01:21:44       Like almost like a mantra for our trade like that more you do it, the better you are. Like the way you take care Arrow out of the quiver, the way you put it on the string, like you want that to be. If fewer just gripped, right? It just happens. Exactly like fighting. I'd say that same exact thing, same exact thing. You're dealing with anxiety and having this pattern that you've carved so deeply into your mind and your body, your neurons that your body just knows automatically. Like when I was competing, there was moments where I did something where I didn't even know I did it and it was already basically don't even remember what the hell you're just moving on this total reaction and training. Yeah. You know, and for a archers that moment like you have to kind of like carve that path also because like if you're, if you're fighting, you get to spar a lot so you get to hit people a lot.

Speaker 2:          01:22:41       You get used to the idea of moving away and hitting someone. But how often do you get to shoot an animal? Right? I mean, it's really rare when I shoot one, like maybe once a six months, you know, once a once a year. If you're a busy person, if you're lucky, maybe you go a year and you don't even get a shot at one because you don't to maybe get this one trip a year and like what, you know, you go somewhere and like you were saying, you didn't see anything until you saw that fond. That could have been the

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       whole trip. Could have been the happens all the time. You Go, you'll be an outfit for days and days and days you don't see a goddamn thing. And then next year comes along and then next year sucks too. And then the year after that you finally get her shot. Knowing Jesus, your, your whole body's just wracked with anticipation and nerves. And I've seen people where their legs are shaking, their arms are shaking. Like I've seen videos where guys hunting elk where you see their arms shaking as they're pulling back. Their bodies just jacked with adrenaline. It doesn't change and they just try to keep that pen in the general area. That animal pull through the shot. For those of you who don't know, this is like stepping into a place that you have never been before. You're not sure what's going on and you whistle and a six to 800 pound animal with big chunks of shirt bone coming out of its head and it's dick slapping against the belly, literally piss all over the place, wants to come in and either mount you from behind or beat the piss out of you or stab you with his antlers. It's a forest horse with swords growing out of his head. I mean, it's, it's. These are, they're amazing and you freak out, man. It is. But a one every five. If you're an archery hunter, once one bowl every five years or one successful,

Speaker 6:          01:24:23       uh,

Speaker 5:          01:24:24       season in five is the national average. That's why Kim Haines is such a freak because he has not been a, he's, he hasn't been unsuccessful on an archery hunt since 2009. And the guy goes many times a year, how many times a year, but all the ultra marathon running and all the weightlifting, all the crazy shit he does and constant practice with archery. He just like when the moments come, he's the. He's so dialed in, he's so ready to go. It's really, really impressive. You know, I mean, I don't think people understand. So when I see people on his instagram page takes new school, what you're doing is you're a coward. Why don't you fight that thing hand-to-hand, like you have no idea what you're looking at. One 10th of one percent of all the hunters, that's what that guy is. He's the, he's the one 10th of one percent of the hunters. And he's out there being way more successful than anybody else doing something that's insanely difficult. But to the uninitiated or the people that just have never experienced it, it looks like he's a animal. Hating monster was out there shooting God's beautiful creations,

Speaker 6:          01:25:31       right? Sometimes Brian and I'll go hunting with military guys will come out and I'm back to the. Just having the process. It's the craziest thing, guys that are really good at this, you know, and it's like, it's almost like a robotic action when it's go time. It's like sit there, pack down, you know, just, it's pretty wild to watch somebody that's, that so practiced at that, you know, the way they load, the way they reload on target, on glass like it, it's, it's, it's amazing. You know, and you see true pros at, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       well that's a totally different world when you have to shoot people and they're trying to shoot you to think of the anticipation. The anxiety is involved in shooting a beautiful deer like you missed. Now imagine that's some urine, some foreign land and this is some enemy guy that you're engaging with and he's trying to kill you and you know, like you ain't gotta be. I mean that's where legit. Like that's one of the interesting. Do you know Joel Turner's? I do. Joel Turner has a whole series on target panic for archery. It's really interesting. It's an online series. What was it called? Something. See if he could find the name of traditional. Yes, yes. A like Denver. Maybe something like, I'm not sure where he's out of,

Speaker 4:          01:26:46       but it's an instinct fighting instinct or something like that.

Speaker 5:          01:26:50       No iron mind guy. Yes. Closed loop, open loop guy and he's got this whole system that he's put together and I actually paid for it and wash it. Very good stuff. Very well thought out. Very interesting stuff. But a lot of it is on the mindset because he was a. He was training police officers. He's training like Swat team members and how to keep it together in the middle of a firefight. And he actually was talking in one of the interviews that I saw him in about a conversation that he had with a police officer that was in a firefight with a bad guy and heard this, heard his words and his instructions going through an executed correctly and did the right thing while this guy's shooting in his car window and glass was flying and bullets are flying at him and he stayed calm and killed. This guy was shooting at him. But that, um, that this process of having a thing that you like, a mantra that you relay into your head that relates to a physical action and that you drill it in yourself. So it's like, it's unavoidable. Like this is how you do things.

Speaker 4:          01:27:55       That situation. We described what the bowl coming in like, yeah, you shake your head goes a million miles an hour. Like if you don't have something to fall back on, the odds of you making a mistake I feel are way higher than you.

Speaker 5:          01:28:09       Successful. Yeah. Yeah. You gotta there's gotTa be a thing in your brain that you can like press play on, you know. And then once you do that you could like there was an article that I read recently about a, it was about choking and sports and it was essentially there's the article was essentially saying that what you have to do is figure out a process that removes your conscious mind from the equation. Like figure out a process of training where you know what to do. Like someone's, you have a basketball, someone's coming at you, you juke left. You go right. You know how to do this, you've done it so many times that this is just a natural reaction and get it to the point where you don't have to think about it so you're not overwhelmed by this moment in the anticipation of, what if I fuck this up? Oh my God, so many people are watching what happens here. What if I do that and you'll. You'll see those moments where people just lock up and they panic. You see seen in fighting all the time.

Speaker 6:          01:29:02       The tradco thing versus a compound or recurve, right? That introduces. That's when this shit can get crazy because say with the compound, you draw back, you hit the wall, right? The bow only drawback so far. You look through a whole, you'd let it up with another whole. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's no picnic, but then you know, once you start shooting in traditional, there's nothing that's super repeatable. I mean you try to do it, but you pull it back as far or if you don't pull back far enough, you goof up. You know what I mean? There's no aiming and it's a funny experience when all the sudden, the first time you draw back on anime and you're like, what the hell is go like there's no reference, right? Your brain is just kind of bouncing around. And I think where that, uh, what was the guy's name? Joel Turner. Yeah. Where he is just.

Speaker 2:          01:29:50       And he shoots with us some loop. He shoots Mongol Scott, you know, Mongol style is the Mongols used to have a thumb ring. They would have a bone ring. I've seen it. They would wear around their thumb and that's what would fit on the groove of the string. So they'd hook the string with their thumb and then close their index finger over it and they would draw back like this. And according to Dan Carlin from, if you've never heard this before, if you've heard me rant about this before, I'm sorry, just ignore me for a moment. There's a, there's a amazing, a podcast series called hardcore history. It's by this guy who's a friend of mine. His name's Dan Carlin's, says genius historian who's so good at relaying. He'll, he'll say he's not a historian. He definitely is, he's super humble guy, but he's so good at relaying information in an entertaining and dramatic fashion and he has a series called the wrath of the Khan and it's a five part series.

Speaker 2:          01:30:44       You have to pay for it now. Um, but it's like a dollar an episode. It's so worth it. It's worth 100 times more than that, but it's a five part episode on the Mongols. And he said that their bows were like 160 pounds raw. They were just these sinewy fucking savages that were incredible archers that were. They had developed this ability to release the Arrow as the horse was in its Gallup. So when the horse was in the air where there wasn't a disturbance, so they would time the release of the Arrow to when the horse was actually in the air force. They had it down and the had a thumb ring and that's how they would draw back. So not with your fingers, like most people do. They would draw back with the thumb loop, the index finger over the thumb. And for some reason they found that to be a better method day.

Speaker 6:          01:31:26       It's like a, it's like a, you know, it's like a primitive release. That's the thing with the traffic, right? Your fingers, you can pluck, you can just hit 100 different ways to screw up. Right? If you had that right, you let go. It's probably a lot more consistent.

Speaker 2:          01:31:40       Well that's the whole, the other is you could see that that's the bone thumb rings and a lot of people like to shoot that way. Now. It's really kind of interesting stuff man. And see how it holds. And then you throw your finger over the top of that thumb ring and you know, your, your thumb pushes back on it and you need your finger, your index finger closes over the top of your thumb. It's not dissimilar to a lot, to a release a lot of ways. Yeah. Like, um, when I shoot a compound bow, I shoot a, I use a Carter release thumb trigger release. It's a good tension is I use one called the wise choice. It's, um, but I use attention based one to the evolution, or is one that John Dudley put out called the silver back that are really prepped. Hurry up.

Speaker 2:          01:32:25       Go. No, no, no, it doesn't because it's the same motion. You know, the idea is you don't ever pull the trigger. You, you lock in, you pull in place. You put your thumb over the trigger. Then once you're in place, you concentrate on the muscles that are in the center of your back and you pull those and the release goes off and you get a surprise shot. So the idea behind that is there's never a moment in your life now and you punch it and then you move the Arrow where you move the boats or did I get it? I know there's all that shit is out of your head because all you're doing in the shot process is pulling and concentrating on those muscles and the center of your back and your scapula and contracting those. And as you do that, they released just goes off because your thumb is pressing against that trigger and it just goes.

Speaker 2:          01:33:06       And. But you have to resist that urge that everybody has just now now punching. So that's the difference between like John Dudley's approach versus Joel [inaudible] approach like John Doe, Joel Turner has the same approach and even talks about it when it comes to compound bows of using a thumb trigger of polling and letting you know, letting the shot go off automatically. But Dudley, he thinks that you should start off using attention based release, which the way that works is you actually hold the safety, hold the trigger until you lock in place. Then once you're ready to execute your release, the safety and all it takes is like a couple extra pounds of pulling and it goes off. Interesting. Yeah. So it's like a Carter evolution or he. He has one that he makes called the silver back that is a two finger version of the Carter evolution. So he feels like the least amount of fingers that you have on it.

Speaker 2:          01:33:57       The least amount of tension. I mean this is the point to try to do people like what the fuck are you rambling about? What I'm trying to randomly about like this, this thing is insanely complicated, so to the people that look at this and say, oh, there's no skill involved and Oh, you're just killing this defenseless animal like is the most difficult way to get your food. Yes. It's the most difficult way. There's no more difficult way to get your food than shooting an animal with a bow and arrow. It doesn't exist unless you want to fucking use a spear. I make. I guess it is not getting growth. I guess you could to jump out of a tree with a knife and. Yeah, but that stupid mean, but it is that, you know, the animal comes for your strategy. Like for me it fit is proficient and proven. Be Proficient. When Kevin and I were making the switch to go back to traditional archery. Why'd you guys decide to do that? Man, I got so tired of the stuff. Yeah, like tough stuff. Changing every year. New Sites, new strings this new.

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       I got to hate, hate setting up a compound bow. I hated it. Why? Because there's just so much going on and like, Oh man, is that me? Or is the bowl out of tune, did my string stretch

Speaker 2:          01:35:09       timing and twisting your strings and how I'm going back

Speaker 6:          01:35:13       this year, I'm going to get a job. I like to cows point plus.

Speaker 2:          01:35:16       What are you going back to traditional? Are you going back to compound

Speaker 6:          01:35:19       back to compound a company is making a called [inaudible] really nice bose and our camouflage pattern. I'm, I'm pretty excited. And plus, I don't know. I, I, I've had very mixed success. I would say I struggled a little bit. Yeah, I'm sure. Um, but how could you not but the um, but the, but frankly that the simplicity of it is so appealing. You know what I mean? It's, it's fantastic, right? Versus setting everything up and plus, you know, you get to a point where a modern compound bow, if you practice a lot meaning for years, right, you, you'll get to 90 yards to where you are professional day. People are going to complain and I don't know,

Speaker 2:          01:35:59       it's not, it's not really that ethical for most people to shoot at 90 yards. But it is for a guy like John Dudley or you know, a guy like cameron hanes because they do it all day

Speaker 4:          01:36:09       first. Grammy is a very technically proficient shooter in anything that he shoots him. He won't say it, but we used to sit in the ski area parking lot, Greyhawk parking lot and 106 yards is as far as my adjustable site would go on my bow. So he would stand there and he could shoot a lot further. But I mean the groups that he would put in at 106 yards were a maze because he's got that mind to do it so he can shoot,

Speaker 6:          01:36:36       you know, I don't know. But the thing is is that after awhile you get to the point where I don't want to shoot something at 50 yards. I want to shoot my next elk at 15 years. So you know what I mean. So I think that's largely it. And I think without a doubt, in the past three years I've become way better hunt. We have been know both. I mean cows killed bubble both years with his trad. I missed a nice bowl two years ago, but it's just hard, you know, and if nothing else you're going to get way better at hunting in the sense that you're going to hunt more because you're not going to kill shit at first. Right. But you know, being, having to go from, let's just say 80 is a Max yard and I don't want to get into the argument about distance, but let's just say that was, you know, your Max Max on a perfect situation with the compound, with a compound bow down to say 25 or 30 yards. It, it's interesting. It just makes you in your head just so much more. You have to try so much harder. You know, and I don't know, I just people that experience,

Speaker 2:          01:37:39       I have no desire whatsoever to hunt. Even if you're a lifelong vegetarian, you're never going to eat me. Just go shoot a bone Arrow at a target. It is so relaxing and some weird meditative way. It cleanses your mind in some way. Zen

Speaker 5:          01:37:56       stuff, man.

Speaker 6:          01:37:57       It's like fly fish and kind of same thing. It's like you're not necessarily. I don't know, you have to concentrate, but at the same time it's like taking a nap or something. You go shoot for 20 minutes, 30 minutes and you're done. You're like, okay, what was I thinking about before?

Speaker 5:          01:38:09       Yeah. Oh, I love to do it. When I've got like a business issue I'm dealing with or something I'm trying to like sort out in my mind. I just go out in my yard. I got a big rubber elk out there, 85 yards and they'll just start shooting that sucker and you see you don't think about nothing but that shot. He just sent her that pen. Try to stay calm, relax your hand, let the Bogo off and there's no room for anything else. And then in its activities. Yeah, and you walk up there, you pull your arrows that you walked back, you're concentrating the whole process. I don't know. I think it's cleansing and some sort of a weird way, and I'm not a traditional bows shooter, but I would imagine that was accentuated even further because a, it's even more like instinctive that you have that involved as well. So like instead of using a site, you're sort of like calculating in your mind the drop of the Arrow over distance

Speaker 6:          01:38:59       you can, but it can be more frustrating to way more with the compound out. I mean, with the recurve. I've gone out and shot two arrows and I was like, fuck this. I'm done.

Speaker 1:          01:39:09       Yeah. Ken and I are all, uh, our uh, our first accountant gallery retired. And so we all went out and had some beers with her and I was a little fuzzy the next morning. I forgot my tags. So, uh, I was like, I'm just going to call for, for Canada. And we took off into the woods and called the Bolin within 20 minutes. Didn't have a shot at. Oh my gosh, this is a great day. We ended up calling in three mobile, three more bowls that day, but the bowl that Kenton got a shot at, um, he would have shot four times before it ultimately came into recurve distance.

Speaker 6:          01:39:51       Right. But it did come in. It came, I mean it was in four yards at one point. Oh my God. I mean, it was this, it was like this close. That's so crazy to have an animal that big that close to you. It was crazy and fed to cows point. The beauty was, was that it was hanging up out at, you know, 50 yards for five minutes and that would have been the end of that experience. Right. I would have not had that same experience. And then it comes up and to count what it licked you basically write in cap and looking through the Mesh in the back of my cab. It's saying it's coming straight towards me, but I kind of caught me, you know, to where I didn't have a shot. Um, and then it went and looked and I missed it out. I'll never forget that. But um, but it would have been over. The experience of having, of having to get that close is really cool. You know what I mean? If like, like I said, it would have been done and we'd have been packing it on. It would have been cool, but whatever. And that would have been incredible to shoot it there too. But, but just to be that close and visceral and it's like, holy smokes, I mean this thing is here. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:40:59       It's one of the things that um, I talked about with Jason Harrington from we were talking about the difference between like mountaineering and hunting and it's like all these things and hiking and hunting. It's like all these things are beautiful and they're amazing. But then add the add to that, this experience of this really intense moment with a wild animal where you have to execute something, you have to execute a shot and you have to. Everything has to come together and has to come together perfectly. And that is what makes this so addictive. And that's something that man, I try to relay that to people and I try to explain it but I just feel like my words aren't adequate. I feel like everything, everything I always say to describe it, I feel like I'm just rambling and it's not going to work because you have to kind of have to see it to understand.

Speaker 6:          01:41:47       Yeah, I mean there's very little reference, right? And that's what you're talking about. Like you can say, well, it's like, you know, imagine, you know, skiing a perfect, um, you know, 50 degrees, powder line, right? Or whatever, something kind of, you know, heavy with consequence. But it's totally different than that. It's like it's,

Speaker 5:          01:42:06       Oh, I don't know how else to describe it. It's, there's certain words like there's no words for a giant mushroom trip, you know, like I've had, I've tried to talk to people who've never done anything. Like, what's it like, you see things, you see pretty colors. Is it really worth it? Like you can say, God, you just got to take enough. Yeah, you can definitely see colors. But I mean I'm just saying those words to beat, but then, you know, you talked to somebody about it and then like a year later they go, dude, I did it. Whoa. Like a buddy of mine recently just did DMT and he had talked about it for a long time and they finally did it and then he just, he sent me a text message. He's like, dude, I'm at the elves. Was like, oh, trip. No, no, no. He texted me after it was over because he had been thinking about doing it forever and then it's one of those things, unless you do it, whatever I say, the way the words that I'm using to describe their just not going to work.

Speaker 5:          01:42:54       I think that's the case with so many experiences in life, like try to describe being in love to someone who's never been in a relationship. You know, there's no way you could never do it. You can never explain the love of your children to someone who doesn't have kids. Who's the dog? Like, Oh man, figure it out. You know, and I think certain intense experiences in life like hunting or he just even mean we even forget the hunting mean just being in the woods, like attempting to hunt an animal is insane. Almost psychedelic experience. It's one of the things that I described people, the first trip that we went to, the Missouri breaks when I shot that deer, when I locked eyes with that animal, the fruit for the first time and I was sitting on a pack, a looking down the scope of this rifle and I was looking at this animal and then I look at this animal through this rifle scope and he's looking at me.

Speaker 5:          01:43:47       I was like, this is a weird life form that's living in this very barren and desolate place where there's no people for miles and I'm locking eyes with this thing and it was oddly psychedelic. It was oddly like paradigm shifting. Like the moment was so intense and weird. I was like, wow, I didn't expect this. Like this is. This is like. I mean kind of. I mean I'm feeling like because this thing is looking at us, I'm feeling that this thing is thinking like what are you and what are you doing it? We probably never seen a person before. What are you, what are you doing here and should I be worried

Speaker 1:          01:44:25       about you? Right. He's gone. That wasn't here yesterday. Yeah. What is that?

Speaker 5:          01:44:28       What is that? And you know, he's always seen is like baseball hat and then the metal barrel of a rifle and he's not seeing much. He just seeing us resting over the top of a ridge looking down on him and he's like, fuck that. It's, it's uh, it's really weird intense experience. It is. And the, because

Speaker 1:          01:44:49       you do look at things in a much different way and, and you know, kind of the point of talking about all this public land stuff is I, I do feel like people who hunt and fish carry a big load of this burden rent through the taxes that we pay that or taxes that if you don't hunt or fish you don't pay them.

Speaker 5:          01:45:08       So we've highlighted that on the show. The actual amount of it we've showed from the rocky mountain elk foundation, their instagram page, they have a really good instagram page that has a bunch of different examples of different states of the sheer volume of money that comes in because directly because of hunting and fishing and it's staggering. It's in the billions and is by far above and beyond anything else. By far, the the largest amount of conservation money that comes into this country, the largest by far. It is so fishermen, nothing even close. It's amazing when you think about it that way in that sense. This system that we have here with public land and with using these tax dollars to pay for, for all the wildlife biologists to pay for the fish and game to pay for the population management. It's amazing. It's an amazing system,

Speaker 1:          01:45:58       but if you're a hiker that your peak bagger, right? You're finding names on the map and you're like, I'm going to hike to this lake or I'm an hike to this peak European. That's. We call them a peak bagger bagging piano bag, a peak two peaks. Have you been to? Yeah, exactly. That's interesting. Peek a big sounds like in that community, right? Boulder? Yeah. Fourteeners and bag and a lot of peaks and people fall off those peaks to man. Yes. They get stuck up there. Sucks, but you know, you are taking a trail on established trail and you're covering miles and you're getting to your goal and maybe you're snapping a picture or spending the night and then you're coming back on that trail or maybe it's a different trail. Whereas one hunter,

Speaker 5:          01:46:44       as you know, as soon as you step away from the truck and

Speaker 1:          01:46:50       or out the trail head, you are plotting your own course so you're making your own moves and there it is a totally different experience. Everything means something different to you. You're looking at it in a different way. You're trying to interpret different signs and your base note path. Yeah. And your, your, your choices are pretty much limitless. Absolutely limitless. Like when you leave, as soon as you get off the trail you're just like, you know, hopefully you hear, you hear something or you see something, you smell something and that begins your day, but you don't know. You might, you might not leave a 100 yards that day and you might cover, you know, might be a heavy, you know, eight mile, you know, 5,000 foot day you don't know. And that's, I don't ask the craziest thing, you just have to be prepared for whatever. And so, you know, get people who are like, well, there aren't any wolves here anymore because in Idaho wolves were, you could see them a lot, especially in Ketchum area, the Lohmann area there wolves that, you know, that they're smart critters, they know that they knew that nobody was going to shoot at them.

Speaker 1:          01:47:55       And so they were a fairly common occurrence to see. And then once the season opened, once they let people go out and they issued tags, um, they picked it up really quick and you didn't just see them hanging out next to the road and people said, well, none. Hundreds killed all the walls. But oddly enough, the hunters are reporting Wolf's sightings. No, I saw that.

Speaker 5:          01:48:16       Yeah. They're not killing all the wolves. They're killing a pretty small number. Right?

Speaker 1:          01:48:21       Job. As hunters, we're not, we're not, we're not getting, getting the numbers that were supposed to.

Speaker 5:          01:48:25       So what do they do? Do they, are they hiring professional wolf killers to, to go after a wolves like they're doing in California to go after cougars? Since they killed, since they stopped the hunting season on mountain lions, they haven't stopped killing mountain lions. That's something people don't understand. Like there was a depredation order on a mountain lion up in the Malibu mountains that had killed 11 Alpaca and a goat in one sitting this big fucker just. And they know the, the lion too because it's tagged, it has a collar on it. And uh, this fucker just found an Alpaca farm. I just went to town, just had a glory killing spree. So in California they can't know no mountain lion hunting whatsoever, but they're everywhere, especially in rural areas. There's a place called to hone ranch where that bolt came from. See Front, there's one lake that they have like a pond they have out there and they have trail cam up. They've got 17 different mountain lions on trail cam.

Speaker 1:          01:49:21       Oh my God. You're about meeting people fairly, um, fairly often out here, huh?

Speaker 5:          01:49:24       Well, it can, it's, you know, it's a lot of it's joggers or bikers, like people on trail bikes because they think that trying to get away. Yeah. And other things. It's almost like a cat with a ball of yarn. They just can't help themselves. Right? Or flight risk. Someone's running the like pitch were you gone.

Speaker 1:          01:49:40       But the thing is it's like 100 or are doing something different than your typical recreate are out there. You know, we're not sticking to a game plan. So I feel like you're that different hours. Different making Predator and prey noises, right? Yeah. Yeah. You're just doing things differently. So I think feel like I get a little torque sometimes where people think, oh well of course hunters are going to say there's wolves out there. Know it's, it's. This is good information for biologists because we're out there. Actually our point in the woods is being out there looking for animals.

Speaker 2:          01:50:16       Now, one of the reasons why I wanted to have you guys on is to really sort of discussed this public land issue and also to allow people to understand what's at stake and to give them options to look into and to different resources that they can check in on. Like, like a back country hunters and anglers. A Bha. Yeah. Back Balcony, back country hunters and anglers. I can't say it. My mouth starts shutting down after two hours these days, but what they're doing is a amazing like highlighting like what this is and how important this is and what are the other things that people could do if they want to look into this stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:50:56       Yeah. So Bha is big, loud voice and I think they one of the best groups out there right now to really just raise awareness. I'm on public lands and access issues. Teddy Roosevelt conservation partnership does a phenomenal. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:51:12       there it is. A country hunters and National Wildlife Federation. By the way. You read that there are two folks if you want to buy that public land owner tee shirt, they have it there

Speaker 1:          01:51:22       now. Um, so what the main issue is in Kenton I, we talked about, you know, you have an incredible platform here, Joanne, and we don't want to waste it. So the, this is a nonpartisan issue. If you don't like 100 and $800 or anglers, that is still your land. If you never leave downtown La, all this public land contributes to your quality of life through clean air, clean water, just knowing that it's there should be it something that is warm and cozy for you because it is your birthright as an American

Speaker 2:          01:52:01       in this country where 95 percent of the people you meet, something, it might even be higher than that. It's depending upon it and there's so many, so many discussions these days about where your food comes from. There's no better way to find out where your food comes from then to actually go out and get it.

Speaker 1:          01:52:20       Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. But man, if if you're buying beef or lamb off off the grocery store shelf, those grazing permits that we talked about, that happened, a lot of that happens on federally managed lands, whether it's Blm or forest service ground. And the thing is this is nonpartisan again, and one of the things that ticked me off about old Jason Chavez, hr six,

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       21 and said, hey, you know, this started under Obama, Clinton or Clinton Clinton took designated these lands is useless. Yeah, who cares? I don't care. It was Clinton, Obama, trump, that doesn't matter. Who Cares? You're taking the Lexan. Who Cares? Yeah, point to back. It's a nonpartisan issue and I think a lot of times people would like you to believe, Oh, if you're a republican year against this or if you're know pro, second amendment, you can't vote for that and this, that and the fact is is that you can, if you have a Republican leader in your area, they can change their mind. You need to be involved. Right? And if, and if that's the way you feel, that's great, but you have to realize that you can't have your cake and eat it too. It doesn't have to be one or the other. Like, you know what I mean, you, you can be a conservative and still be pro public lands, you know, and you need to work and call and do what you need to change them if they're not. Because if, once it's gone, it's gone and use social

Speaker 5:          01:53:46       media because social media is an amazing tool and that's what killed her six, 21. It was directly killed by social media and he was killed quick who was killed a couple of weeks, you know the pressure that they faced from guys like me posting it to one point 8 million people on Instagram, one and a half million people on facebook say $3 million or whatever the fuck it is on twitter. Like all those people that add up and then those people find out about it. They jump in and they realize that this is a. This is a really important issue. It's a giant issue and Rinella always points out that he's. By the way, Rinella wrote a great article about all this and about how killing her six, 21 is just one battle in the overall war and we're not. There's no not out of the woods by any stretch of the imagination and that article is available right now. If you go to his twitter, it's on. I think it's on a meat eater.com. Is that where it is? Yeah. Yeah, but no, that's not. That's one, but there's one that I tweeted today. This is the one from January. Twentieth is one that I tweeted today that he just recently wrote and he calls himself a political unit because he's like, look, he goes, the Republicans want to sell off the land and the Democrats want to take away your guns. He's like, I don't know where the fuck to go. You know? In that sense,

Speaker 6:          01:55:03       well, I'm not. My point simply is that you can change. You know what I mean? It's like if you, you need, it's not a part. It shouldn't be a part of your representatives are there to represent your interests and this is the article. It's Roosevelt

Speaker 5:          01:55:17       robber barons and the continued fight for our public lands and he just published it today. And is that on [inaudible] Dot com?

Speaker 6:          01:55:25       Yes. Yes. The meat eater.com. Somebody owns [inaudible] dot com. Yeah. Isn't that weird? Give it up, bitch. I'm going to give it up. What does media to go to? Meat Dot Com. What is that? I think it is it available. Is one of those things has been just like a picture of a steak for years. There you go. Garlic top sirloin.

Speaker 4:          01:55:44       It's delicious. Best Cowen school. So is this like someone just holding it? I think the person may have died or something and they're dead. Uh, but. So yeah, they have a fork with a piece of meat. Look, here is my food, chicken drumstick. Look at my food. Hr Six, 22, going to gut the folks that are supposed to be out there protecting our resources, making sure people play Nice on, on public lands. Yeah. Um, you know, the uh, planning two point, oh, just a terrible name. Not Sexy at all, but that is the new management plan for a bureau land management that just got shut down. It's going up to the Senate right now. So the thing is, if you want to know what you can do, you have got signed these petitions that are going around Trc p, he's got a great one. The sportsman's pledge. Um, you know, join our rod and gun club. Bah, a national wildlife federation. These lands are here for everybody. It's not just hunters and fishermen. Um, and Oh, you got to do is write emails and call your duly represent your officials that are there to represent you.

Speaker 5:          01:56:58       And by the way, back country hunters and anglers has a form that you could fill out on their site. They'll send it for you, you enter entering your email, they have like a, a letter that's already written up, so it's super easy to do and they'll, they'll direct you to where it needs to be sent. And you know, they're doing a great job of setting that up and letting people know. I mean, we got to be, got to be wise about this. This is, we have an amazing place. It's an, it's an amazing thing that the fact that you guys live, like you were saying that, uh, what does it church Frank Church, what does it, Frank Church, Frank Church wilderness. I mean, imagine if you went up there and it's fucking mall.

Speaker 4:          01:57:34       Oh No. Somebody chopped all the trees down and we'll put up a gold cart. So if you look at the state planned example, read the state lands are there to make money for the states. And like we said, state gets in trouble. They sell those lands, fire anything, right? They just, it just sucks all the money out of the state and then the states literally mandated not to have a negative balance so that once that happens, it's like, how are we going to make our money? How is Roosevelt so wise? He had just panic, fear of God put into him because he had this realization that he's like, oh my God, the entire reason I am who I am today is because I had this opportunity to go out and chase animals and and if I saw horizon line, I could go over the top of it because nobody owned it. He was like, that made me who I am. I got to try to make sure that this is here for the next person.

Speaker 5:          01:58:28       People don't understand that in many countries that's not really possible and that's actually the story of Robin Hood. Story of Robin Hood wasn't really about stealing from the rich and stealing their money and giving it to the poor. It was about hunting lands. That was the original. The king did not let anyone hunt in the kingdoms hunting lands and Robin Hood was like, fuck you. And he went out the air and he was shooting deer and getting people food because people were starving. And that, that is something that we can do here in America that you can't. It's like, it's one of the reasons why you get so much hate mail from Europe. You've got a lot of hate mail from places where they don't have recreational hunting because to them, and they don't even understand it and they're eating steak, they're eating steak. Like my wife got into an argument with one of her friend's husbands were, um, you know, she was saying that, uh, I was on a hunting trip and this guy was eating a steak, carving a steak, literally are at dinner.

Speaker 5:          01:59:24       And he's like, well, that's deplorable. That's deplorable. He hunts animals, like, you don't have to do that. Like, she. And she's like, you're eating a steak. She's like, well, these animals are farmed animals. And they're. I go, she goes, well, don't you think that that animal lived to horrific existence? And then finally was killed. You think that's better than someone just out of nowhere. You're hiding behind a bush making cow calls. And you blast and Arrow through the heart of some wild beast and then take that thing down off the mountain. You have the experience, you have the food. You also have this wild encounter with this, this magnificent beasts that you have this connection to that every time you eat, like every time I eat a steak off of that elk, I think about the experience of hunting that thing. I think about seeing it.

Speaker 5:          02:00:06       I think about cutting it up and carrying it out of there. I did the whole thing about it is all it's all connected. That loading it into the truck, hoisting it up. Like the whole thing is like in my mind, every time I cut into the meat and people at the end of the day are genetically hardwired to do that. Yeah. It's weird. You know, it's weird when you tap into that file and go, you didn't know about this file working for it, man. Work Experience on public lands. There is. It's just. We talk about this at length all the time and Kenton's got this knicker analogy and we're walking around shot show and there's this European hunting company down the road and he stopped me and he's like, Hey Kel. It's like we lose all this land. This is what we're going to be making knickers fake hunting.

Speaker 5:          02:00:56       I'm not gonna say there's fake hunting, but it's like a canned experience hunting here and ones where they released the pheasants out of the back of a truck and that does happen folks. There's a thing called pheasant shoots, European pheasant shoots and they literally release these birds and the birds fly away and guys stand there with guns waiting for them to release from the cage and shoot them. That's how Dick Cheney shot his friend. Remember that? Remember that story? He shot his friend in the fucking face and that was a canned hunt where they just opened. They literally open a can. The birds fly out and they wait and boom and shoot them. I mean the hunting thing. It's honestly like being outside

Speaker 6:          02:01:40       of your, your comfort zone. That is it. Fabien and, and I mean, you know, and if, if that's not going to happen, I don't know, I'm not interest

Speaker 1:          02:01:47       did, I don't know man, but public hunting experiences, man, we're all, you know, that's where you follow the rules read because everybody gets the same experience on and on our side. We are constantly like analyzing our clothing and analyzing our days and we're getting to be totally truthful ma'am. Life at firstline. Pretty fricking good man. We get to spend a lot of days in the woods way more than your average joe gets to and that's how we make stuff good and

Speaker 5:          02:02:22       well with the way you guys do it is you have new pieces and then you give them to like your representatives, like people that you guys have like w, what do you guys call them? Ambassadors or something like that when you call them, you know, team guys, team guys. So you have a bunch of guys who I follow on Instagram, hardcore hunters who spend a giant chunk of their life out in the woods. Some are public, some are not,

Speaker 6:          02:02:46       but the idea is to set, to send them to people that use them in tons of different environments like, you know, we hunted in a rocky so we know we've got plenty of experience there, but it's cool. We'll, we'll send stay stuff to, you know, guys hunting in BC or guys hunting in ak where it's raining all the time, but that's the, that's the goal, you know, or where it's hot, but being able to send stuff out and have it used in these tons of different environments allows us just to build better stuff, you know? Yeah. And it's

Speaker 5:          02:03:14       real trial and error thing. Were you taking these super experienced guys and when you said some guys are public, some guys are not. What you mean is some guys have public profiles in some guys, they just stay under the radar and just third guys like that, right? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:03:30       Yeah. And I mean that's it. Everything gets thoroughly tested in the end. That's the fun part. But the amazing thing about us and one of the things that I love is we get interns and people from all across the country that have sometimes very little experience and sometimes their input is the most valuable for sure. You get a bunch of people who are like, I know it all right. I, oh no, don't worry about that. Nobody does that. And then you get this girl from Ohio. And she's like, well what about this? And this happened to me. And you're like, really? Yeah, no, because it's a fresh brand new perspective of somebody who just started hunting. And I think that that's been an incredibly valuable on our line too. So

Speaker 6:          02:04:13       living there too is it's living in the mountains, you know, you get to take stuff from all different sports, whether you're, you know, riding your bike or whether you're back country skiing, like a lot of that stuff crosses over, you know. And I think that allows us to round things out nicely. Like, you know, hiking, hunting is quite different than hiking, right? Like hiking, people want to build the lightest thing they can build that can do whatever. Hunting totally different. You're off the trail, you're going through bushes, like you kind of have to throw that lightest thing out the window, you know, you have to approach it of like how heavy can I actually build this and have it still work well because it's going to get thrashed, you know what I mean? So you've got to approach it from kind of a different shift and how, you know when you build stuff it needs to be versatile, right?

Speaker 6:          02:04:58       Like you can't have, you know, I don't know. It did. The equivalent would be like having a guy that was a construction worker and he's got an eight penny nail. He's got a 16 penny nails. He have ate penny hammer and a 16 penny hammer. It's like, no, you need to be able to do everything with, you know, a certain amount of stuff because you're going out in the woods and you know, you might be walking slow, you might be stopping, you might be going uphill, you might be going down hill, you know, and it just allows carrying fewer things that do more job.

Speaker 2:          02:05:26       And then you might have to go through thick brush and you might have to have clothes that are durable or if you're in Texas you might have stuff that has thorns and shit. It's going to be ripping your clothes and don't go to Texas. Don't go to that effort. Everything stabs you in Texas is that. Texas is a great example of what could possibly happen if we lost public lands because Texas is weird. I love Texas. Don't get me wrong. I love the state. I love the people. It's one of my favorite places on earth, but Texas hunting is very strange. There's a lot of it that's high fence and a lot of it is like over feeders. They have like these feed machines and these animals come to the feed machines and they're overrun with wild pigs and then an amputee is fucking weird.

Speaker 2:          02:06:10       African animals that you can hunt anytime you want. I mean, there's. It was a bit for my last special, but it's true. There's more tigers in captivity in Texas than there are in all of the wild of the world. Really? Yeah. Really? Oh, I'm telling me that's not true. Totally true. There's more tigers and dudes. Fucking backyard. It's private collections. Not Zeus. Not Wildlife. Sanctuaries. More Tigers in private collections in taxis will 100 percent legal. There's no laws in Texas. You just can't have wheat. No wheat for your. That's it. No gay marriage. No Lien. I want to hunt in Texas, but clean, but yet, but I would like to 100 there. It's awesome. I love Texas, but you like they have like symitar oryx and fucking Elan's and all these weird African animals that are running around. Look at that. There are more captive tigers in Texas than in the wild.

Speaker 2:          02:07:01       As real. As real as fuck, but yeah man, you don't need the type of innovation. 20,000 privately owned big cats including tigers, lions and cougars currently living in captivity in the US, but the exact number is unknown due to insufficient recordkeeping. None of your fucking business quarter doesn't count like those little kind of those little whatever. No Man. I've been to Texas and I've, I've, I have a friend in Texas that has a buddy of his that has a fucking tiger thing and his yard, he's got this giant fenced out. Area's got a giant and in his ranch he's got a bunch of fucking tigers and it'll just feed them like a cow. They'll live cow. No, well they could if you want to. Maybe we won't admit it to me, but they'd take a cow or calf, shoot it in the head, toss it over the fence.

Speaker 2:          02:07:49       These things tear it apart. Unreal. And they watch it. Ha. They fucking drink. A couple of Budweiser says, fuck their cousin and he ha. Look at that. Chief of Dallas and his wife are the proud owners of three, 600 pound tigers. They have raised since they were born, Jesus Christ, police chief in Dallas, former police chief, Jesus Christ. Like many Texans, Bill Rathburn is no longer satisfied with an ordinary pit will. I had a German shepherd, but that queer, all you want to do is Hump my leg. Tired of this Nigga, Goddamn American animal. These cats tend to mind me even though I use no discipline. He says, no discipline at all. Shut your fucking mouth before you get killed. He has 22 tigers. This guy said he's even trained these tigers to remain team. Oh my God. You unfortunately you can buy at tiger for less than a thousand dollars. Now it makes me think tigers do new.

Speaker 2:          02:08:46       See, Texas has completely different laws when it comes to wildlife. Wildlife in Texas is not. It's it's private property. It's a whole different situation. I mean they have tags and it comes to like white tail deer and indigenous species, but when it comes in, who knows if even the white tails are indigenous, they're. I mean they're bringing them in from farms so they have bigger racks now. They have a lot of weird shit. They do, it must be if you have a high fence, then it's once you add things like fully fenced, everything within becomes private. Yeah, it must be. I think that's exactly what it is, but there's a lot of like eastlands and a oryx and all these African animals and the axis deer that have gone rogue. They've gotten through fences and now they're just wild and free range. Our Dad, what do they call them in?

Speaker 2:          02:09:34       In New Zealand? Convicts. Escapees, escapees. I would. That would be crazy if a cat got loose, it could go nuts out there. Right? Oh Man. I'm sure it's happened. I'm sure if you drive down the road somewhere in Jasper, Texas or something, you see that tire. Scariest thing in the world. Tigers in Texas. We don't even know how many there are. I don't. I. I'm blown away right now. I have a whole bit about it, man. She watched this come out of the woods. This. Yeah, it's. It's a very Texas a very odd place, but what I wanted to highlight is like, man, you don't want that to be the only way you can get a hunting experience because Texas is, it's fucking weird. We weren't, we wouldn't have jobs, man. I mean, yeah. The reason for innovation is that competition, that being outside, pushing yourself, you know, climb, uh, new peaks. Why is the hunting clothing industry like a bunch of fucking high school girls?

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       Because there's, there's, there's a lot of weirdness like cliques, like if you were Sitka, you're not supposed to wear cool. You. If you were cool you, you're not supposed to wear firstly may. I thought you were an under armour guy sitting over there with that first lectured on, like what are you, bunch of fucking girls, high school girls. Not that there's anything wrong with being a girl or being in high school. I used to be in high school and every girl, but I have no problem. I'm glad you picked that to clear up, but you know what I'm saying. It's like fucking, it's like a clicky little weird thing where they're on teams. Like, Hey, there's, there's no goddamn teams. Like I had a conversation with one of the Sitka, Harrison, Jason Harrison found the, you started out with Sitka and then he, they, you know, they pushed them out and they bought it out and I'm sick of guys in the cool.

Speaker 5:          02:11:17       You guys don't get along. Like you guys are out of your fucking minds. This shit bro. Staff thing. Maybe that's where that green team mentality, man, it's the same thing as people from Texas that don't like people from Wyoming, you know? It's like, uh, you know, we played y'all in the folk and superbowl and kicked her. It was really hard to believe. I don't, you know, we're very friendly with. Yeah, you guys are you guys on. I think it'd be real hard for me to believe that anybody's out there being like, listen, if you put this on, you fucking hate those people. Oh definitely. There's people like that out there. People kind of just pick it up and run with it. Yeah. Some, I'm sure some people are ultra competitive and it comes from that, like just the way it is in business, right? Instead of concentrating on what you're doing, a lot of people concentrate on the other people that are doing what you're doing in this.

Speaker 5:          02:12:03       These fuckers are trying to get us and we need it Vogan manner, but the competition is good. That's the good part. Yeah. Right. Yeah. The competition is amazing because you guys are constantly elevating your game. Like I said, Ryan, I warrior stuff when I went to Nevada and it was like, man, those fucking. What is the, like the corrugated. Yeah, the corrugated guide pants. This fucking, they're great man. They're so, like loose, like when you're walking in them, there's no binding at all. They're tough and durable and I'm like, you guys nailed it. You nailed it on a lot of stuff.

Speaker 6:          02:12:36       It's a cool system in that, you know, generally speaking you go to a few different shows, like the outdoor retailer and whatever, and you get to see all the best stuff, right? Like whether it be from the Albert, Patagonia, everything. Um, and you know, you get to build the best thing you can build and there's like, you know, a couple of few companies that literally like us, that cost is no object. I mean it's way down the list and I, I wish we're making things as cheap as we can and that's still expensive, but it's a fun thing to be able to make the best you can make. Right. And some people might say, oh, our steps better because we, I don't know, whatever it is, what it is, but

Speaker 5:          02:13:16       everything is so good now. Yeah, it's, it's so great. Selfishly we can make it first selves you so much better than when I started hunting in 2012, which is incredible. And the four and a half years that I've been hunting stuff has gotten a lot better. It's, that's really interesting.

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       That's awesome. Yeah. There's an accelerated curve out there of competition and innovation and it's for people that don't even hunt, like you can get your stuff in solid colors and it is amazing outdoor where it's as good as you're going to get. Like I have this, this jacket that I was wearing the day when it's cold out and my wife was like, what? A ski and Jack and like firstlight joke and pitched because it was just black. I'm like, this is the warmest fucking jacket. It's so light and so thin, but you know, it's. What is it? You're puffy. So you guys got the uncompaghre a great jacket. I mean it's just, it's the perfect jacket for like when it's Kinda cold out. And I wore that in Montana when I was doing on Anthony Bourdain show too. I'm like, it was fucking freezing out and I'm like this Jack.

Speaker 2:          02:14:16       It's amazing. It doesn't want nothing but a good time. And Dan Bailey the pheasants forever. Do who's good time. And Dan bayless the way you say the nervous with the two. He had the two griffons, the two pointing dogs? Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh yeah. Oh that's awesome man. Yeah, the bird fonting is fun, but it's like way down on the list for me. Well Dude, you're skin you. So we were talking about elk hunting in Idaho. Yeah, we're doing that. When we doing that, here's some time out. Okay. Well, it's hard to give you some. I've got kids. I've got a wife. Everybody's bitching at me. I've heard of those things. Yeah. Fights those battles all the time. You've managed to stay clean. Ken's got restrictions right now. Donald Trump has made your house to swear free zone. Is that what you were saying? That wow, what happened?

Speaker 2:          02:15:02       I to my wife might not have the same political views. So if we've gotten pretty uh, uh, was it the grab 'em by the pussy talks that he pushed her over the top. It did me no favors as far as having a house that was free loose. Do you have boys or girls? Two boys and a girl. Oh, okay. You're lucky. Yeah. He's just like a balance there. Girls and two boys in your house and then you. Oh, for me, dude, it's all chicks. My fucking whole house overrun by checks. And my mom, my wife's mom lives nearby. She's over the, over the fucking house too. It's all women. All women. You get a lot of times women. Yeah. Daddy's going to go outside and pretend he's still a man. Fucking hide. Sirens trying to bring you to the rocks. It's funny though, you know. So what, what laws to get established in your household?

Speaker 6:          02:15:54       Oh, I don't know, you know, it just, uh, we just have to be concerned with what, what, what, what we say doesn't, isn't it negative? How did Donald Trump bring this about? I don't know. I think, like you said, I think there was enough. Like, you know, I have two boys, right? So they're not afraid to call each other a pussy if some things go. You know what I mean? They heard on the news. Yeah, no, but they're, you know, they're into their extreme sporty and they're skiers mountain bikers. Then, you know, inevitably it's like, you know, there's the jump built or something and first thing like it's called, as, you know, the p right? Pass them

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       out. Plan. That was the first thing. I was like, no, no, no, no, you're a Dick Dick, do you like that? And I was like, whoa. She's serious. Like she did not. That was not going to be a derogatory term and that's fine. Whatever it shouldn't be, but you know, it was funny because you know, they'll heckle each other and you know, they're boys. They all, they want to get after some nasty gnarly. Yes. You know, jump or whatever on their bikes and somebody's got a Guinea pig it and sure enough it's probably the one that got called a pussy first. Right. So we don't do well for my, for me, when Donald Trump, the whole story came out. It was great because then all of a sudden everybody, so many people are saying pussy and it seems like this country's like backing. We had gotten some weird politically correct phase just in the last couple of years where people are so mad at so many different.

Speaker 2:          02:17:17       Different groups are so mad at the way our culture is that there was all these words you weren't allowed to say anymore and there was all these new things like you're not allowed to wear sombreros because it's cultural appropriation. They were getting mad at people for cooking other cultures, dishes, like people got so politically correct that like the good thing about Donald trump being in office is that I said that political correctness is just took a missile to the Deq because like that guy as the fucking commander in chief man, that political correctness shit, it's like, it doesn't seem very effective. It didn't work here. Like you can't, you can't and people are fighting and of course in rallying and protesting and all that jazz. But it. The good thing about, it's like you realize like, oh, that's just a word like pussies. Just a word.

Speaker 2:          02:18:01       Like in that guy was saying pussy, now he's the president. Like it's not really like this is like taboo word that summons demons, you know, it's, it's just a word and its intent. That's important. It's not demonizing words and making these words impossible to say because we've made them like, there's certain words now that you just can't say in our culture or people get upset at you that were real common. Like retard. He calls someone to retard. You're not saying someone has a disease. You know, you're, you're saying someone's a fucking knucklehead, all the cars retarded. You, you know the intent of that word, but people are saying, no, don't say that anymore. That's offensive will. The more you create offensive words and the more you create words that are not there, you're not allowed to say them. The more you get to give those words power and people are going to, they can't wait to se them.

Speaker 2:          02:18:46       They can't. Then those words become like nuclear nuclear option. Then you've got something right. You've got the c word, you know it's, you're always holding onto that one for chickens. Crazy. You know, like listen, like that. It's impossible to come back from. There's not an equivalent word for men like bike telling us. We can't say that word. You can call it dicks all day long. You fucking Dick App guilty as charged on tv now practically that you can. It's as long as it's not like a, you know, I mean I think like NBC, CBS, they still don't use it, but like any cable show they use that. Now. All I know is Kenton's wife tends to look at me like that is the source of looseness right there. That's single man with a mustache. This man got cut loose to spend too much time with him.

Speaker 2:          02:19:37       It could all go down. Uh, just go feral. Yeah. What's, why. Like no one tells Ryan were to go. Ryan can just go into the woods anytime he wants. I don't think that's right. Yeah. What about he doesn't have a leash on how many times did he call and check was just out there with no leash collar. I get a long leash. I get along, especially during hunting season, but mark might still elite. You have a leash. Brian doesn't have elite. She's just asked him. He doesn't have to call anybody. He just goes where he wants it is what it is. But if he just decides to take that mustache and go for a hike, nobody can tell them that. That, that pisses women off because then then demand goes, yeah. Hey, Ryan says healthy with no leash still whenever he wants. I wish I was like that.

Speaker 2:          02:20:18       Like I love being married. I love having kids. I love the whole day. I love having a family, but I got a buddy, my friend, Ari. You know what already did? He just went off the grid, shut his fucking phone off. He won't answer his emails. He just disappeared. He went to Pacific. Just want to do it for a few months. He's a. he's a stand up comic. Hilarious guy. Successful show on comedy central is doing great. Kicking ass. He just decided, you know what? I need some experiences in my life to write about, to talk about, so I'm just going to fucking stop talking to people and disappear for a few months ago. I talked to him in two months. I haven't talked to him. I don't know where the fuck is. You call his voicemail. It just says the subscriber you have reached to shut off incoming call.

Speaker 4:          02:20:57       That's amazing, dude. This thing is just the most devious creation on the planet earth. It is. It is

Speaker 7:          02:21:07       scribers request. This phone does not accept incoming calls. Message and V, one

Speaker 2:          02:21:16       rockin message. <Unk>. It doesn't give a fuck if my wife heard that. Well, he's out there. You think that's good? He's got no one to call in to check in, but he can check in and do whatever he wants, but he wants everything cool. Yeah. Right. Late. She can call me up. Hey, faggot. I'm still alive and then hang up the phone. That's it. I'm like, God, listen.

Speaker 4:          02:21:39       Yeah. The ability to checkout. We can. I mean where we are, it is narrow valley public land everywhere. As soon as you get off the valley floor, you're on public land like we talked about. I can hate. I can hate to the fricking Yukon, man. That's crazy and you can be disconnected as disconnected as you want to be and there is no price tag on that. That and I need.

Speaker 2:          02:22:07       Well that's the constant dilemma amongst a lot of hunters, especially the really hardcore guys. A lot of the podcast that I listened to like a bunch of them, but the big dilemma is how much time does your family allow you to get out? How much? How much time can you spend? Can you do one of those 30 day trips? You know, like there's a lot of guys that do like a 30 day trip that's pretty heavy. That's a heavy as fuck, but there's some street cred to that or should I say trail cred. Right, right. Like, you know, I'm fucking Raylynn said to me once, it was really funny, man. We were laughing. We were talking about grizzly man. We're talking about the Werner Herzog documentary and Rinella was. He goes, I'll tell you what though. He goes, that guy did some fucking hard camping. He goes, I got to respect that guy. That guy was a hard camper coming from things the hard way it no one loves the way more than Manila. He loves it. Yeah, he does.

Speaker 4:          02:23:00       Yeah, but there's something to be said for it because just like we were talking about, you know, things get more pc or whatever. It's you start patting yourself and all of a sudden you don't know what rough is.

Speaker 2:          02:23:12       Safe spaces. NERF, the hard edges of the world. It's super important that we'd be totally inclusive. Competition is not a bad thing and there's no more primal competition than you trying to go out and get your own food that's running around trying to stay alive and what do you have? You got a pointy stick. You're trying to shoot another concession.

Speaker 4:          02:23:31       Every time a hunter goes into the woods, something dies. That's what I. that's what I hear all the time. It's like, well, I saw five people go into the woods behind my house on a public easement. I was at a city council meeting listening to this Gal talk somebody public easement so people can access public land. Only way their housing development got built was so that because they allowed to easements so people could get to the public land. She's saying that five people went past her house and five elk died. It's like not the case. I'll tell you right now. It's never happened. I don't punch my tag until the absolute last day because as soon as I clip it, I gotta be back into work.

Speaker 2:          02:24:14       Yeah, I mean I've had conversations with people that don't understand the like, you know, you go out there and you shoot these animals. I go, no, you go out there and you try to get an animal. She's like, well how often are you successful? I said, well, I went on 500 slabs and I'm super dedicated practice constantly. I'm absorbed in it. Five hundred, three of them aren't successful, so that's. And that's a good, that's a good average. So you're spending 15, you know, like each, each hunt at least five days out in the woods and just nothing. Sorry, come back home mouth and struck out and go, oh, that was an absolute failure. My kids looking at me like such a loser. Nothing like nothing struck out like you didn't, nothing, nothing, nothing. You little. Yeah. Yeah. Figure that out. That car company can come with me one day.

Speaker 2:          02:24:56       Right now you're too little to hike. Kyla, what are the ages? Six and eight are getting close. They love. They eat everything though, man. They've eaten bear elk. The elk all the time. Maybe they've been eating wild game since they were little. They know they don't know the difference. They like it. They're both scanning. Scan since they were two nice. I took them when they're just so little that they just pizza down the window. They had the little connector with the two skis and they just slide. My name is Rosie. I don't even think she was too. You have a rosy? Yeah, no way. No Way. Oh No. Well, because Steve Daughter at. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Kids are, you know, it's an amazing thing to have a little person that you're raising and you get to see them learning things for the first time, which will never happen again.

Speaker 2:          02:25:41       You know, everything they learned for the first time, like every, the first time they went skiing. I remember the this look on their face like we've got the mittens on like this is crazy. I've got a helmet on. Whether they're so happy and excited like there's never gonna be a first like that again. And the more first you can have in this life, I think the better and more rich your life will be. The more experiences, the more times you can learn thing and people get locked into these patterns in their life and I don't know why it happens and I don't know what causes it, but we get a job and we get a career and we get a path and a neighborhood and that's boom, and then the first stop, there's no more firsts and then it becomes the same shit over and over again in life becomes mundane and life becomes tired and grow old in a lot of ways other than aging, but the other thing that happens is you realize that this is what's going on and then you seek novelty.

Speaker 2:          02:26:35       You seek new experiences and hopefully that's what happens to more people more. When they listened to podcasts like this and they, they, they hear you guys talk about your experiences and they said, God damn it. I need some of that in my life. You know, I need. I need to just go fucking camp. I need to just go out there. I need to wake up and hear bulls bugling and I need to wake up and hear birds that I don't recognize Turpin and squawking and look over the ridge and see a bear. I'm like, whoa. The fuck is that. That's a wild bear. It's just hanging out, chilling, being, doing bare stuff like all that stuff is like having new experiences like that. It's just giant for your life and again, if you're not in a hunting, you don't even want to go try archery.

Speaker 2:          02:27:18       Just try that. Just try that. Just a new experience. Call somewhere, find a place that gives lessons. Oh, just go drive out the national park, drive out to bears ears national monument. Check some things out. That road trip car camping is fantastic. Are to get people out of their comfort zone. Part might be steps, man. Go do it. Go do it. Get out there. One of the most fulfilling things I do, I try to do. Take somebody out on their first time every year and it is one of the most fulfilling things I do every year. I'm sure it's just the best. Well, it always blows somebody's mind. I mean all you have to do is hear a vehicle and people are just like, whoa. Yeah, I mean it doesn't sound like a real animal. Jamie. Queue up some elk bugle because for people who've never heard it before, they don't know what the fuck we're talking about. You live in a city somewhere, you poor bastard. It sounds like an animal from the Lord of the rings. It doesn't sound like a real thing. It sounds like some crazy exotic bees.

Speaker 8:          02:28:18       Is that a good one? Heard a little bit of it.

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       Did you just pick the first one you found? Now that's not even like a crazy one that's like, that sounds like a little bitch bull. But this is a 1000 pound forest horse that's making me.

Speaker 9:          02:28:38       That's a real bull right there, baby. That guy is like, I get all the pussy.

Speaker 10:         02:28:52       No,

Speaker 9:          02:28:53       look at him screaming and then they throw their head back and just launched that in the end. So these guys are going back

Speaker 4:          02:29:01       fourth in this video.

Speaker 4:          02:29:05       What a crazy animal. It is. Not something you get sick of hearing. Never met every time I've been elk hunting and I've been elk hunting a few times now you see one and you hear it and just your whole body like tingles. It's like, Whoa, what a magical experience to just be around those things, to feel bad, to feel that noise in your chest. Jesus to the size of that fucker. Yeah. God, I mean the things that are keeping those things alive or the money that comes from hunting, that's super important for people to recognize. There was a time in this country with those things were almost extinct in the early 19 hundreds. There was very few. There's very few deer. There's very few anything and now there's more deer in this country than the war. When Columbus didn't discover this place and that's why people are so passionate about this man.

Speaker 4:          02:29:53       Look at the history like we've landed. We said, hey, this place is going to be different than where we came from. The land or the animals belong to the people. We fucked that up real quick with market hunting. Yeah. Market hunting is an interesting thing that most people don't. Didn't even know that that was a real thing. They know that we kill off all the buffalo, but they don't really understand that back in the day before refrigerators and you got to get meat like pretty much then. Yes, a man read Michener's chesapeake, that there's a great description on market hunting in the Chesapeake Bay. Guys going out with a low profile boats with cannons on them, stuffing them full of shards and nails and stuff, and they'd go up to these big rafts they called when ducks and geese sleep in the middle of the night on big bodies of water. They all get huddled up together and the on this is in the Chesapeake Bay, but it happened in the Great Lakes. Also big rafts of birds. And uh, you would, you know, push off in the middle of the night, sneak up really slowly on these big rafts of sleeping birds and touch this cannon off. Shoot this cannon. And then, and that's how the Chesapeake Bay retriever was a basically bred into existence was they needed a big hearty dog that could withstand cold water. This dog would spend hours never getting back in the boat, but just constantly retrieving for hours because they'd

Speaker 1:          02:31:19       shoot, you know, and probably a mouthful of nails, 200 birds. Right. And then that dog had to then sit on the pile at birds and defend it the next day. Everybody else. Right. Because those burgers are worth money. So they were taking them across to a.

Speaker 2:          02:31:36       So they had to be guide dogs or guard dogs rather. And they also had to be retrievers. Yes. Whoa. Yeah. Whoa. And then they would bring those to market by the barrel full and that's an. They were only good for a couple of days. Yeah. People would, you know, they would try to keep them cool. And then people try to buy them as quick as they could before they spoiled and then you have to go right back out and do it again. In that process resulted in just a devastation on the wildlife in this country.

Speaker 1:          02:32:03       Yes. And the same thing was happening with white tail deer, elk, black bears, everything. Nice. And obviously, obviously,

Speaker 2:          02:32:10       yeah, that's the one that everybody harps on, but they don't realize that it was pretty much everything

Speaker 1:          02:32:15       we could eat they shot and that's what we can put a price tag on it. Right? And that's one of the major issues that we're seeing in Idaho is they want to, and with some of this auction tag stuff is we're starting to put a dollar amount on our game. And what do you mean by auction tax where we're pulling to eggs out of the general pool. So like right now, um, let's say in the state, Idaho, um, uh, we could all put in, you know, a thousand people put in for a, for elk tags in a prime unit, the unit that grows the biggest balls, well, in order to raise more funds, they started to remove one of those tags and auction them off. So that's putting a, you know, whatever we could all put in for $30 for the remaining three elk. But if we choose to, we can all try to bid on each other for that fourth tag.

Speaker 2:          02:33:10       So if there is a limited amount of tags, people have to realize that your chances of drawing that tag are probably pretty slim, unless you build up points every year, you build up a certain amount of points in that makes it more likely that you're going to draw a tag. So people that don't understand the process, so one person, they'll take one tag and they put it off and they'll allow it to be auctioned off and sometimes they'll go for hundreds of thousands of dollars, right? Like crazy rich dudes. So there's two schools of thought. One School of thought is look how much money he's going to conservation because this one rich asshole that wants to spend $400,000 to kill a bighorn sheep.

Speaker 1:          02:33:43       Yes. And I think saying it like you do the rich asshole thing. That's how everybody says it, right? And of course I get really frustrated with that because I'm like, well, aren't we as the remaining sportsmen in this pool supporting the rich asshole by giving him the ability? Why don't the thousand people in the pool just agree to spend a couple extra bucks on the tag? Well

Speaker 2:          02:34:07       that might help, but is it really going to get you the hundreds of thousands of dollars? So that one tag, I mean, it seems like without burdening the regular sportsmen who doesn't want spend like didn't

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       Montana like significantly raised their tags, the pricer tags recently? There was a lot of complaints. Yeah, they're a. But they put a lot of burden on the out of state hunter, not the instate. Right, right. Yeah. The resident hunter gets a break, right? They get our instate. Um, you know, I, I'm, I supported a tag fee increase for resident hunters because we haven't had one in a lot of years. So what's a tag like an over the counter tag for elk right now in Montana, or excuse me, in Idaho, I want to save 40 bucks. Thirty five bucks. That's amazing. Yeah, and I want to say Montana 17 as a resident, she knew how amazing it is there. For 17 bucks you can get 500 pounds of meat and most honestly your effort to. Most hunters, I mean speaking for the guys that I hang around with and nobody else.

Speaker 4:          02:35:06       We like to drink our beer. What? Yes. Well, and spending $17 on a case of beer that has gone all generously say a couple of weeks. Right. I love, I love to hunt elk and deer. Absolutely love it. It is. I mean it's just something that I look forward to the year long, right. I can bury more than willing to spend more than 17 bucks on, on the potential. The thrill of the excuse to go hunt for sure. Yeah. I think that's reasonable and that will pretty much within anybody's budget. I mean just raise it to 20 bucks and then all that money is going to go back to the state and it's going to help and it's still very, very, very reasonable. Collectively say, I mean it reasonably don't know the exact price generally because you can buy a sportsman's package. So I think it's 100 and I don't know, $5.

Speaker 4:          02:36:02       You can hunt and fish, like basically anything that's not a draw everything over the counter as long as you don't go over the limit of what you could get. Pretty much, I mean pretty amazing. Yeah. And Idaho's a true lottery. Right? So there are no points. Oh, it's one of those dates. That's interesting. Yeah. And I truly like because it spreads out the pressure. So our draw odds are fantastic. So now we're where someone wants to auction those things off, like what is a, like one of those crazy elk tag because I know that wild sheep is the big one, right? Like bighorn sheep are the ones that people spend it for three. Oh five. Is that what it was? Three hundred and $5,000. And at the same an elk tag a sheep while for shakes, Syria that, um, that we hunted that I think last year went for over half a million, but you've got to keep in sheep. Sheep are the rarest thing that we have, like they're doing really well in the areas that they're doing well in. But then the brakes, we saw a ton of them. It's crazy everywhere, but disease, you know, they're super susceptible to disease, domestic sheep diseases. Correct. Because there was a sitcom of video, uh, that they did. They did those short film about the, uh, door

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       I heard is, how do you say it? T e n d e r o y, yeah, tenderloin. And these sheep are suffering from diseases that are coming from domestic sheep. So they're trying to figure out a way to breed a domestic sheep that doesn't catch this disease so that they can reintroduce healthy sheep into these areas and not have them be infected by these different diseases. They get some really fascinating stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:37:43       Do you remember a kit? Fischer was on that hunt with us, um, in the breaks, he was Rowan, one of the boats, um, he works for National Wildlife Federation and that's when he does is he does conflict mitigation basically. So he identifies those, a grazing allotments and most women are on public land. Um, and he identifies the conflict or grazing allotments mostly for bighorn sheep that could put domestic sheep that could potentially be carrying diseases in contact with these wild cheaper. And so he's looking to, you know, typically pay the rancher that has that grazing allotment fair market value for that grazing allotment and he just turns it back over to uh, the US forest service.

Speaker 2:          02:38:31       And that's a real issue with buffalo, right, with wild bison because there's two schools of thought and there's one school, it's about Brucellosis and that brucellosis will somehow or another be transmitted from the bison to cattle. Um, but apparently a lot of people say that that's kind of a bullshit argument because it's really about the bison eating up all the grazing land and forcing out the domestic cattle. So they using the brucellosis as an excuse to say that this is the reason why we need to kill off the bias and get them out of the way. I think there's some legitimate little bit of on both sides.

Speaker 1:          02:39:05       Yeah. And, and the difference between the sheep and the sheep don't carry a disease. Bison definitely do carry, uh, the brucellosis. But domestic sheep do carry. Some domestic sheep do. But the wild ones, the wild wild ones don't. But they can catch domestic sheep and they have no, they can't find the immune systems. So. But yeah, the Bison one is, you know, I got a big eastern Montana family. It takes a lot of ground to grow beef out there. And if that's your livelihood, absolutely, you know, putting more animals on the countryside and some fucking hulk bison thing way bigger than a cat man. It's going to directly impact your livelihood. But I think just as we were talking about earlier, man, there's some, there's some happy medium there and if, especially if we're looking at, you know, um, some of this oil and gas stuff that's getting scary right now, like especially with like all of a sudden we're saying that you don't have to clean up after yourself after he had, you know, started a big mind somewhere, right? Like I would much rather have bison out than

Speaker 4:          02:40:13       like let's raise funds through sports minor recreational than digging a big pit in a beautiful spot. So I don't know if that's going to cover it though to play with the Dakota pipeline liquid they're talking about there. It's just like the amount of money that's going to come from that is just staggering. And so the amount of pressure that's involved in making something like that go through is also pretty staggering. It is, but it's dangerous, you know, and what the disaster that could take place is you can't put a price on it because what, what, what could be done if they ruin a river system, if somehow or another this gas line breaks and you have oil flooding a river system the same way they had that bp oil rig disaster out in the Gulf. God, could you imagine that? Still dealing with them, right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:41:03       Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah. And how about the people that had to deal with it? There were living near there that were sick, you know, there's all sorts of diseases and there's all sorts of lawsuits going on and all the cleanup crews. I mean they had, they made prisoners clean up the fucking, the BP mass and there's a lot of weird shit involved in that, right? It, uh, I'm truly not educated on the economics of it and my, you know, my brain says that no, there's, you know, we couldn't, there was no warm fuzzy eco, you know, lodge that we could set up that would match the funds from, you know, oil and gas. But yeah, man, yeah, I'm just trying to think longterm and boy, it just wrecked that landscape and the landscape is what I've been in love with since a little kid. So yeah, you know, then nobody wants to be able to let your toilet water on fire either.

Speaker 4:          02:41:54       You ever see those fucking gasland documentary is coming right out of the tap and they guys sticks a lighter to it and was fucking water's on fire and people are both labeled supplementing what we'll do. That's always been the case. Not with these fucking people, but these fucking people is directly related to fracking. Like just all these apologists for that stuff. It's like how many fucking earthquakes needed to have an Oklahoma before you go, hey, um, is this okay? Like, what do he doesn't have a thousand earthquakes a year now? Is that cool? Like, yeah, as long as it's under a thousand, we're looking at as long as we only like pollute like three or four wells a year. It's like survivors. It's fine. We got plenty of bottled water, but it's constantly evolving thing. Technology all across the board is getting way, way, way better.

Speaker 4:          02:42:40       We know way more about these migration routes and we used to, we know way intact migration routes are what we need for healthy mule deer. Elk. Um, yeah. That's like a recent thing they realized how far mule deer travel, right? It kind of blew these biologists. So wind blowing. Yeah. Hundreds of miles. We have a deer in our unit that migrate 170 miles. Whoa. Yeah. Wow. They have to. I mean like years like this, we've got, you know, right now we've got, I don't know, six, seven, eight feet of snow on the ground. Right. If they don't

Speaker 2:          02:43:11       travel, it's their curtains. But when you come here and you see no snow but so many people, what's better regarding, I don't know what's better. No snow and a massive swarm of humans or eight feet of snow. Not that many humans. What do you guys, because you guys stay where you're at and I stay where I'm at, like a trick question because I always want to talk to people that come from a place like catch them and you come to Los Angeles and see the fucking swarmed the high, the get on that four or five and go, what in the fuck is this thing? Dude, I, I'm not gonna. When we hopped on the bus, just go get a rental car. Last night I was gripped. It felt like I was at a Nascar race car. Oh yeah. They're aggressive. You have to be. Yeah. They did a study that showed there's a direct correlation between the amount of footsteps people take per minute and the population that they're in and also the faster they talk they.

Speaker 2:          02:44:19       If the population is higher, they will say their syllables faster. That will say words faster. They'll say more words in a minute. Well, I was a direct correlation from New York. Definitely talk faster. Oh yeah. Oh, for sure. Yeah, but it's fascinating. They walk faster to here it goes. Senator, what is this? Amy? Clears way for finishing Dakota. Oh army. I'll work amy finishing Dakota access oil pipeline by granting easement opponents likely to appeal. Oh, just now. Um, but yeah, you know, where, where you guys live. It's just a completely different kind of place. Look at the first quote. Go back to that. Go back to that. You should mention that Obama were approved. This project, the pros play. So the loop towards. Can't blame trump. Fuck face lip tards. Oh that is one of the best words. It's come out of this whole fucking right versus left.

Speaker 2:          02:45:16       Oh Man. I mean, like I said, I'm just speaking off the cuff. They're like, you know, I love, I'm an outside guy. I don't want that stuff to ever change. But I realized there's got to be something for everybody to. I mean we're a big country. It's more than just me and like super out of the way place. So I don't ever want to live in New York City, but I know a lot of people will fuck in. Love it and good God. Yeah. Good luck with it. But it's interesting when I see guys like you that come from Idaho and then come down here to Los Angeles and I see, look in your face, you're like, fuck this place. You can't wait to get out of here. I live here. I'm raising a family. Here is where I do my work. And you guys are like, fuck this place. It's just interesting. It's like the driving. I don't know. Cow. I like ran a stoplight already. I like, I don't know if it gets to you too lazy.

Speaker 5:          02:46:10       It's crazy feel. That means to the next guy. It's like when you put your blinker on to change lanes, that means here. It means they close that space. You don't want that fucker in. It's going to slow me down by one 10th of a second. All adds up, combat it. It all adds up. It's very intense. It's very intense. Gentlemen, just been a fun conversation and I hope we illuminated a lot of these issues with people and fuck her six slash 22 years. Any bills like it. And we need to do the same thing. We did two, six, 21. We need to do that to 6:22 and contact that guy and start the whole campaign all over again because you just can't remove the resources that are going to protect those, those lands. They're going to keep coming. Very important. So thank you guys for what you do. And your website is firstlight.com l I t e first firstlight hunting.com or first light, first light.com. Firstlight.com. One word. And uh, anything else? Thank you buddy. Good. Thank you. Thank you guys. Yeah. Bye everybody. See you.
