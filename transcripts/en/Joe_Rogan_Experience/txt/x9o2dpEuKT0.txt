Speaker 1:          00:00          The general good experience, it's very interesting whether this Harvey Weinstein case is going to go.

Speaker 1:          00:09          It's very interesting where it's going to go right now he has Benjamin Braf is a charity and if you see what happened, Benjamin Bratt push for dismissal and he didn't get it that the lawyer said the judge said a trial date to get a trial date. Harvey Weinstein is going to go through them, more money to pay off, time to go for time. Then he's going to fire Benjamin, Braf and show up with two women, primarily one black and one Asian or one white and one Asian, and this is when this trouser, and again, very interesting, our results over the higher millions of dollars and prosecute in a private investigators. They'll interview boyfriends. They're going to interview this case. It would be very interesting, unlike the cosby case, weight caused me. Didn't really fuck. How do you know he's going to do all this stuff because I know this is what I would do. I know you come to me and you go, I'm getting busted for this. What do I do? Because of how I grew up around those people, this is what you do, Benjamin. Braf cannot ask a woman the same question a woman could ask a woman, so I'm going to go there with either a black woman,

Speaker 1:          01:33          an Asian woman,

Speaker 1:          01:36          or a white woman. My first two choices are a black woman. You want to get the diversity angle to get the diversity angle and I want to get that. You can't. You're saying that because you're a black woman. Chinese woman. What? I'm trying to stare at me. Did you ever really watched the people versus Oj Simpson? No, I didn't. Very interesting and it said it's time that you sat. No, the holidays. Yeah, the fx version. I watched one episode that seemed very good. Very interesting. How he pulled a dream team together. It's going to cost you 10 mil. Listen to me. Gee, you got two options. You can go into like cars being paid two mil and make believe you're blind or we've put together a fuck it. Then you see him. He went to live with that milky shit over his eyes, like the guy from Kung Fu. Let me, when we were kids foods father followed was like half blind and shit. Yeah, I remember that. Magnesia and shit. That's how will in that plan. Like I'm sick. Routine. He's got cataracts.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Cool. Cosby. Yeah, but he didn't have cataracts. When was that? When he put the pill in the water, he didn't know. He knows what. He knows what the fuck. So he's taking three steps. Read your fucking, you know. Yeah, he knows, but hobby has to play this hand. This is what America is about to watch. They're going to watch something fucking crazy. He knows he go in their bedroom and Braf. Benjamin Bratt had gravano look at the list of Benjamin. Preface and Benjamin Braf can attack a woman show. You look at like legal cases like supports on paper is to John Jones versus Gustafson. I went to New York last week and I went to the Metropolitan Museum of art with my daughter. She loves art and while I was sitting there I was added saying, go on your own. Because my daughter didn't want me taking pictures in front of the statutes.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Anyway. She was like, Daddy, get out of the pictures of the stash, so I'm like, what the fuck am I hanging out with you for? She was in the Chinese way. I wanted to see the Armenian when, but it was funny. I was thinking about when I was 21 and 22 Joe Rogan, I would get stoned to the gills and go to the Museum of natural history. The museum or my hobbies back then since I was such a loan and then people looking for me, I was always a criminal. I would go over the bridge to either go to one of those museums. Why would sit in the courtroom? I would go to a place that had a fucking Italian sandwich and I get a bag of wise potato chips in a 16 ounce coke and you go to any court room. Court starts at seven at the metropolitan downtown. I take the a train and I'd walk. I forget now what you know. This is 1983 81. I was a kid and I would sit. None observed hort. I learned how to. Plus I grew up in that.

Speaker 2:          04:34          You were what you would sit and watch night court, like you'd watch a basketball game, like a game with a sandwich and a soda and potato chips. Men, Chicago this year I think there was a paper view. You were there, right? Yes. So something happened and I was late getting to the arena and they had cut off kind of the loading dock. I couldn't get to it. So I had my oldest daughter with me and so we're having a walk through where all the crowds walking in and you know, dudes all the golden snitch and get a picture golden snitch. My daughter's like, what the fuck's going on? How old is your daughter? So she's 22, so two days ago, Christmas morning I'm opening up presence. So I get the presence for my daughters, the three of them and my middle daughter is very artistic and so they create these cool sculpted beer mugs and there's four of them. One of them's like Bald Guy Brewing Novitsky something and one of them says golden snitch brewing company. So it's cool looking thing and she, she drew me a black and white kind of rendition of all four, which I'm gonna hang up really cool. So then my girlfriend's there, so she hands me the box and she's been telling me all along. She goes, I got you the best fucking present ever in the history of presence. Mike. The hell is this. So I opened up the box.
