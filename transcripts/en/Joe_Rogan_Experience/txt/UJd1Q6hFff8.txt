Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:00:11       oh wow. I trust this guy. You just sense it when it happened. He tells me he gives me a countdown. Oh, okay. I see. Gives me countdown and then he does this. Oh, that's cool. I'm trying to bring that back. When you see, see people and you like him, you give him the double double guns. It's a hard, hard sell these days. Why? Everybody's scared of guns. Oh, you're saying it's funny. You know, like if the odds of you doing it, you have to do it within a certain amount of time from a mass shooting. Right? Like you couldn't do it the day of. I couldn't be like a columbine. You like dunk.

Speaker 2:          00:00:55       Wow. He's so morose. We're fucked up. Sense of humor that guy's got, he's making fun day. How could you, why is that funny to him? That is not fine. I can't believe you're fucking doing those signs to, can I sit down and talk to you for a second bro? Don't you think it's time? It's time to really talk about using these guns. Gestures because honestly, I know it's not really hurting anybody, but we have to pay respect to the people who've lost their lives in these terrible weapons and I just think we should remove it for rails. You just show me the replacement Emoji. Apple has a new Emoji. They got rid of the pistol and they put, they turn it into a water gun. I'll tell you, man, every time I looked at that whole pistol Emoji, and this is no joke, when I used to look at it, it just filled me with a desire to go shoot up a fucking shopping mall.

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       That Emoji, so I'm glad they got rid of it. Me. It made me want to go back to the old west. I wanted to be like a cowboy. Maybe if they had shopped, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Apple adds more gender diverse emojis in Ios 10 please explain to us Google with new Emoji to find the Waterpik and this is what came up first. Yeah. How dare you. How dare you bring this up. 100 new and redesigned emoji characters, including no more guns, but you know, female, female athletes. Okay. That's cool. Cool. Oh, so okay. Gender diverse. All right, well we'll do high for the show. I was thinking gender neutral. Gender diversity does buttes. Those are some sweet new emojis. That's actually cool. Nothing wrong with that. Emojis are weird. It's weird. One like friends start sending you emojis because like for the longest time guys never sent Emoji.

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       No Way. And now it's happening. I love him man. What a useful fucking thing. That animated gifs and the emojis praise God and heaven. It's so great. It saves so much time. It gets across so much more. Language is so limited, man. We have to like, it really is. I think we're going to hieroglyphs what do you eventually, yeah, I think that's what these emojis are. Yeah, right. Yeah. I think there are a modern version of hieroglyphs. That's right. Yeah. They articulate so much, you know, it's like very efficient form of language. It just needs to get a little deeper so that the emojis are animated a little bit so that they can, you can sort of tune in the Emoji to this specific thing you're trying to convey to somebody instead of just the smiley face, which they have in the Apple Watch. You can like kind of like, you can control it a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:03:30       The Smiley face Emoji. You just need to be able to dial it in a little bit more. Do you think by limiting like by keeping it more open ended, right. Like instead of having a bunch of like descriptives nouns and verbs and things like that instead of that having more of an open ended idea, like a smiley face. Yeah, like a smiley face. Uh, and then knuckles, which is like, Yo give me some knuckles, I'll see you later. You know what I mean? Like you can kind of like keep it in this weird non undefined stay. Like we both know what it is but it's not, it's not written anywhere. Yeah. And it relieves you of having to like compose some sentence. Do I use an exclamation mark here? Should I use a comma? What do I need to say? I just want to get, I'm going to see him in like 20 minutes.

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       It's way easier to do like an alien head, a thumbs up, and a smiley face that says everything. It's fun to, it's fun when someone sends you like an alien head and then a pile of shit, you know, like what, how do I decide? But yeah, it's a, it's such a, that's such a wonderful emerging language. It just needs to get animated. And you know, the animated gifts are amazing for really going deep into how you're feeling because some of them are awesome. Yeah, they're fantastic. They're fantastic. It's so fun to send those things, man. Yeah, it's memes. I mean like Internet memes. Really funny ones are really like a new kind of comedy. Yeah. It's like a short, it's like these are jokes. He's like punchlines, but sometimes better than someone saying anything because you're seeing it. Right. Like a Thomson, Aurora had one on his page today, uh, with this face and a, it's a, this is a popular one that keeps going around. Uh, when you nut, but she keeps sucking look at Thompson hours. I mean, this is in no way saying that he invented this because this is, I think he'd be the first admit he's, he's piggy backing on a meme that we all know. Right? Right. I don't know who wrote that first meme when you know, and she keeps looking at his face, look at his face. Oh my God. It's hilarious. But this, um, this meme when you nut and she keeps sucking, there's like fucking

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       hundreds of them. Have you seen them? Like just google when you not and she keeps sucking and then go to images and you'd be like, oh my God, there's so many. Wow, dude, there's hundreds of these.

Speaker 2:          00:06:12       Wow. I would like to know the percentage. I'd like to know the percentage of people who have created these that have never gotten a blow job. I wonder what it is like 15 20%.

Speaker 3:          00:06:27       It's a good one. It's superman was a good one. It's funny because you can put that on phases all throughout history, you know, and there's also versions of it, how you be when you bust. But she keeps sucking or she's still sucking. This guy's playing the cello when you finish, but she keeps sucking. He did so many of them. That might be like one of the most persistent jokes currently on the Internet. Oh my. Yeah

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       guys. A bill cosby one. Oh look, they've got the one at the Indian guy died during a speech. Had a stroke. What? Yeah. That guy just died. Oh, I saw them on the Internet. Is that what happened? Yeah, he had, he had a stroke as he was speaking. Yes. Oh, see, look. You can look right before and that will in the related images. Wow. It's incredible. Right before in the universe. Out of the universe and out. He died right there. Yeah. I think, well, I mean it depends on how you define death. Yup. Bye. Outta here. The bezdecki crazy best death. That's one of the best deaths you're witnessing. Like he said, he just made a great point that he thinks it's kind of funny and then he dies. God, wow. Bless it. Exit from this incarnation. That is a crazy image. Yeah. Um, who is that guy? Do you know who he is? Nope. Hmm. How'd you find him, Jamie? Just from the stack. Yeah. That's a crazy story. Who like, it's so funny, when he died he guaranteed did not think you would land in a, when you not in chic. It keeps me in the power of his death that he would shatter into a million things. And one of them is a meme. Well, here's the thing about these memes. There's guys who are like meme artists

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       and they're really, really funny. And then there's also people that, that

Speaker 2:          00:08:33       they kinda like Carlos man see a memes. Oh yeah, no, I probably should stop using that guys name like that. It's rude, but it's really sad as everyone knows that that means. Yeah. When you, there was just someone just tweeted that, uh, there's a, there's a product in the UK that stole Mitch Hedberg Joke. It's a product that has just written in the bag. His joke, like when you want to eat rice ice, when you want to eat 2000 of the same things or whatever. They like just pop that right in the back. But they didn't credit him. They credited the name of their mascot for the company. Well, let's, it's a problem with memes because people do it all the time. Like there's people that have pages where they're all their memes or someone else's that they don't give credit for, right. And then they get caught and then they have to start re, you know, retweeting stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:09:26       But sometimes you retweet the wrong person, know you, you retweet someone who just copied it from somebody else. Yeah. I've had that happen more than once. You don't know, but they're funny. So it's like what do you do? Do you just retweet it because you think it's funny and you laugh or should you hold onto it until you can find ownership of the meme? Yeah, I mean, I took good question, right? I think if you can give credit, give credit, but if we spend too much time getting caught up in meme distribution, then we're going to lose what is so beautiful about the thing, which is that I create some meme, upload it to the Internet and it either like just molders on injure or whatever, or it just scatters and a trillion pieces everywhere. There's something really cool and beautiful in that. And I don't think meme transmitters are, are thieves.

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       Mostly there's just a few scumbags who take people shit and don't credit them and then they get punished. Usually they get punished by the Internet. Well severely. Absolutely. But there have been a bunch of people that have done it and they're now make money off of it. Yeah. That, that's where it gets weird because there's a bunch of people that are just really funny and maybe they're introverts and they never were really good at cracking jokes socially cause they're, they're nervous, but they're funny. They have a funny mine. Yes. And so this is a form of joke writing and joke telling. Yeah, a really good one too. So somebody had to be the first person to come up with when she, you know when you come. But she keeps sucking. Someone has to be. So this is like this massive plagiarism that we're all laughing at.

Speaker 2:          00:11:07       Yeah. But you know, is that what it is? I don't think, I mean how do you like that guy deserves credit cause he is funny. Right? The guy who invented it burst. That's a funny guy. Like that was a good idea. It's funny he does. He definitely deserves credit for it. So I know what you're saying. But then eventually you're going to like, I guess you can watermark your meme, right? He could have watermark that you see that sometimes but eventually the watermark is going to get taken off cause you know your people were putting in new picks. Well yeah, I mean live. The second one is there's hundreds of different images. So like you could never watermark that. And what's very funny about it is they'll take the word com for example, there was a first human who for whatever reason decided to call his ejaculations calm.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       He just decided on who the fuck was that guy. There is first. That's a huge point because it's universal. It's universal. Yeah. How do you trace it back? I mean, every single word that a human being uses, theoretically you could follow it backwards through time in the same way you follow any organic life form you can, it's called atomology. You can look at the weird a way that language mutates over time and you know that it's somewhere way, way back in the back of the line, there had to be somebody who's like, we'll call it a mountain or whatever. The precursor term for mountain was somebody who was like, it's a hood that someone does that, right? It has to, has to someone. So

Speaker 3:          00:12:40       isn't that the idea that one point in time we all had a universal language, but it became a giant issue because people were sort of conspiring and yeah, they were talking too much. So one of the ways that God has separated us, I might be butchering this.

Speaker 4:          00:12:54       You're talking about the Tower of Babel? Yeah. Yeah. They wanted to construct a coward or each heaven and God was I guess like fuck that. It's like when ants get in your house or whatever, they're getting too advanced. Do you think that's a reverse engine

Speaker 3:          00:13:09       mirrored idea? Like do you think that someone who may be has experienced like brief moments of human potential and realized like w we're missing out on what people are capable of? There's gotta be a way where we could all come together. Excuse me. But when there's people from one country like Japan and they're arguing with someone from Germany and how much of what the fuck each person is saying is even getting through, you know, I mean you're having translators. You were supposed to be going to war with people. You don't even understand what they're saying. Right. Imagine that. Yeah, we've, we get all speak to each other and we all could speak one language. What happened? Well, I mean, isn't that like maybe what that tower of Babel is all about? Sort of like a reverse engineered, like almost saying like the imagine the power, the God like power people could have if they get all openly and honestly communicate with each other freely and ex experience this idea that we're not, we're not, you're not my enemy because you were born over there. Right. This is nonsense. This is some crazy old shit that we should have abandoned.

Speaker 4:          00:14:12       I'm a go, you are looking in the Bible. Those stories. One thing that I just did, I'm so glad you brought this up just for fun. Uh, one of my favorite in the New Testament, my favorite Gospel is the book of John in the very beginning of the book of John is some of the trippiest shit you'll ever read. But I went back to that and so I did a find and replace, anyone can do this. It's so cool. Find and replace the word God with the programmer. And then you can start replacing words with modern day, a simulation theory ideas. So you know, um, when it talks about Jesus, it's like he was sent into the simulation to bring an upgrade and those that accepted the upgrade would be children of the programmer. You start doing that and suddenly you look at this like amazing. It gets really trippy, right?

Speaker 4:          00:15:10       So when you talk about the Tower of Babel and you look at it from the perspective of this is a simulation being run by some intelligent creator force, right? So you see again and again, well not again and again, but right now I can think of two times where the programmer looks at the simulation. It's like, Oh shit, they're about to wake up. Like the same way the Ilan musk is worried about ai becoming too powerful in the Bible of the programmer gets really fucking uncomfortable when the simulation appears to be gaining too much power and has to like shift the programming a little bit because there appears to be some kind of, in the mythology of the Bible, there seems to be a recurring nervousness that the sim, the programmer gets when it seems like the simulation is about to reach some certain level of power awareness.

Speaker 4:          00:16:04       This is in the book of Genesis. They say, you know, they ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, gain self awareness and there was another tree they weren't supposed to eat from the tree of life. And the uh, God says it's weird because in the Quran and in the Bible, God ref, it's referred to as the plural rather than the singular. So God doesn't, the versus something like, you know, if they eat from the tree of life, they will become like us, right? Not like, like us. So there's like a, we can't keep these. We have to keep these beings somewhat curtailed because we don't know what they're going to do if they gain too much power. That's in the mythology of the thing and it kind of works from the simulation theory perspective. If we're a simulation that's on the precipice of a kind of singularity, which would be the simulation somehow becoming self aware, then for whatever reason, whoever's running the show doesn't want that to happen or hasn't wanted it to happen throughout time, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:17:07       Well it's also if you're talking about like eating from the tree of life and becoming like them, uh, I mean that is about a psychedelic as you can get your literally talked about eating something and becoming a god. Yeah. You're talking about eating from the tree. Like what is the tree of life? Everybody's like, oh, whatever. Yeah, whatever. It's history. It's, you know what, God, there was trees back then. Sure. If you're a literal believer, the Bible, you have to think that there was not just an experience where God showed up. Right? Not just this, this, this thing that happened where God came down, he spoke to you an elevator, you know, you're saying people shouldn't eat from a tree. Oh yeah. Cause they could become a god. Yeah. I mean that's kind of where if you're translating stuff from ancient Hebrew to Greek to Latin into, to all these different languages to English, you know, that there's some weird shit being lost along the way.

Speaker 5:          00:18:03       In one of them was probably calling it a tree. Right? Because we didn't even know there's a fucking amazing radio lab out. It's out. It's out right now. It's about, um, about trees and the, the intelligence of trees and that trees communicate and that they share resources that they allocate resources toward the needier ones. Yeah. They have this interaction with fungus, this symbiotic relationship with fungus. It is fucking incredible man. Where the fungus are eating these microscopic bugs and getting their nutrients from these microscopic bugs and that's where the trees are getting their nutrients from. And some of them get him from, from salmon. There's trees that were like, they got 70% of their nitrogen from salmon because bears would eat under these trees. They would eat and they would leave like fish heads under the trees and like the bears would continue to return to the same trees and these trees would eat the fucking fish, the, the, the, the fungus inside their soil and the Miko rise will relationship that they have.

Speaker 5:          00:19:06       It's amazing man. It's amazing dude there if their old life form that we are sleeping on. Yeah. This plants like, and this is not a dig against anybody who's a vegetarian or anyone on the other end of the spectrum that only eats meat. Take the ideologies out. Like, cause everybody knows that I meet or everybody that listens to this podcast and I, I've had issues with people for that or proselytizing vegans and I understand that you're doing it for a good reason, then you're doing it for the right purposes. And I'm, I'm happy for everybody that that is living their life that way. If you're enjoying it and you're healthy, let's all just let that go. Just look at this for a second. Forget about what you're eating. What plants are is some strange, intelligent network of organisms. And when I say intelligent, I don't say it can fucking do math.

Speaker 5:          00:19:59       I'm not saying it can send emails and create fucking moon rockets, but they communicate with each other. There's something going on. They don't need to do all those other things. We defined intelligence far too frequently by what we have created and what what we can do with our fingers and when our mouths and with our ability to communicate with each other audibly and in a manner where I'm talking and you're hearing and we don't respect other forms of communication because this, we're so attached to our idea of what communicating is. We're ignoring some really basic shit with how these plants and these fungi communicate with each other. They're there. Fuck. They're not just communicating with each other. They're sending signals. If one of them is getting eaten, they're sending signals through the air and it's forcing the other plants to change the, they taste

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       to discourage predation. They're communicating when they're hurt. Wow. Do the allocate resources to more needy plants. They find out who in the network is needy and the allocate resources. This, this radio radiolab is fast and that's cool man. They share resources with these microbes or with uh, with these fungus you and also you, cause you were saying, well they can't send emails, but if you look at, I mean, and you separated the human biome somehow from the plant kingdom, which you can't do, we're completely connected to the plant kingdom because we need oxygen to live. So we are deeply, deeply woven into that fabric of intelligence that you're talking about to the point that we actually kind of grow out of that fabric of intelligence because we have a symbiotic relationship with plants, uh, just to exist on planet earth. So you're talking about, uh, the what is called, have you heard of the web of Indra?

Speaker 4:          00:21:51       No, the web of injury or it's also called the net of Indra or the web of Indra. What does his from a, this is hinduism. So the idea is that a way to explain this sort of inner connectedness, connectedness of all things is this like imagine like a web or a net where at every single nexus point there is a jewel, the jewel dinette avenger. That's what it's called. So then, uh, now imagine that every creature on earth are in this universe that has any kind of sentence at all, composes a tiny little jewel on this net. And so this net is every joule is connected via like whatever connects us to plants. Everything is connected that's alive it, which means that any slight movement in any of these jewels creates a vibration that rolls through infinity through the entire net of Indra affecting all o other sentient beings in some small way.

Speaker 4:          00:22:54       It's basically the idea is any third is the jewel net avenger. So anything that you do, it gets sort of vibrated through the rest of the thing. Anything that happens in the micro happens in the macro, macro happens in the micro. It's a beautiful idea, man. And, and, and it seems like this new discovery that's come out about plants has a, in some way really shined, shone a light on the complexity of that incredible net. You know, cause it's so complex because then it gets down to probably the quantum level too. I mean, if you think of the quantum reactions happening inside the plants to create these biochemical shifts, it's startling when you imagine all the weird chemical and atomic movement that's happening inside of the thing itself. It's overwhelmingly beautiful and hard to imagine that we get to be a piece of it, which is pretty cool.

Speaker 4:          00:23:51       But the plants are sending email, you know, because we are the plants, the plants are us, the plants are affecting rumor. Mccann always talked about x. So pheromones, remember that Xcel pheromones, you'd say that mirror that plants have pheromones that they put out to like what you're saying to discourage predation. Bring in bees. I liked that. I said per day session, like I'm smart, but it's a great word. But the um, uh, so, uh, he would say that psychedelics marijuana, dmt, these are Xo pheromones from the vegetable world. I gained deal on mckinna impression, but these are x o pheromones coming into our biome and shifting our consciousness in a way to try to manipulate our behavior a little bit. And, and also, you know, all this stuff coming out of the gut biome to like, not only is there this flourishing vegetable kingdom that is like clearly alive and has its own alien intelligence, but we've got fucking gut biomes filled with these bacteria that could theoretically be controlling our cravings, right? So we're being manipulated by these colonies of alien beings living in our guts, telling us, get another fucking candy bar, man. Wouldn't it be good? Isn't that cool? So true. Yeah. It's so true.

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       There's this darkness inside. You then want that sugar. Yeah. It's a little demon little demon that feeds off sugar. Well, it's a modern, it's a modern, it's a modern way of saying demonic possession. And the old days you'd be like, you got a demon motherfucker. Now it's like, well, your gut biome is craving carbohydrates to survive. Look, if you've got the plague, how's that any different than you being attacked by Vampires, right? Something's trying to kill you. We take comfort in the idea that it's some microscopic thing that we can even see because that makes you feel better. That's looks a lot weirder than a fucking vampire by the way. A lot

Speaker 4:          00:25:50       weirder. It's not a, it's not a well dressed man with a cape and things. You're looking at some kind of strange globular transforming bit of plasma that's swimming around inside of you

Speaker 2:          00:26:04       actively trying to destroy you. He came, he came to see it. We didn't even find them to like what, when, when did they invent microscopes? If you had a gas? 18 hundreds I couldn't guess that. And that's a sad thing man. I couldn't guess that. Let me, I'm going to guess. I think Brian Cowen was talking about this in relationship to them discovering bacteria with surgery. Oh No, it was Chris. I think it was Chris Ryan. I think Chris Ryan might've been the first one. I don't remember. I'm now I'm giving people credit. I'm not sure. But um, the idea was that they didn't know what, what bacteria was for like a long time and they didn't wash their hands. And people die of horrible infections when they were to do

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       surgery on people. It's like, Oh fuck the guy. So this is, I can't remember the guy's name. You may be confined to Jamie. It's the guy he was, he realized so doctors would apparently, uh, they would like do autopsies on corpses to try to understand how the human body worked. It used to be illegal. I was like a big deal to cut open a corpse says doctors are studying corpses and apparently they didn't know you should wash your hands after you handle a Corp. So you would like fuck around with a corpse and then go deliver a baby. Right. And, and the babies, there was a very high infant mortality rate, so I can't remember his name, but a doctor discovered, oh wow. Mind blowing idea. You should wash your hands before you deliver a baby. And there it is. Yeah. He ended up in a fucking mental asylum because they weren't listening to him. And uh, apparently what doctor said, gentlemen, do not need to wash their hands. Oh my God. Yeah. A gentleman, a gentleman does not wash his hands because they're just innately clean. Mm. So yeah, man, people had no idea. They thought that your com was filled with tiny little men, you know, like little humans were in. They're like tiny little, yeah. Yeah. Why did they think that until, until the microscope, I imagine until finally someone fucking came on. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:28:04       Microscopy.

Speaker 4:          00:28:07       How long after the invention of the microscope is someone shoot a load on one? Exactly. However long it took to reach orgasm after building it? Well, it's like we were talking about virtual reality. We're like, how long before they made a porn? I mean when the moment they came up with Oculus, we, we knew. Yeah, I think it's a matter of time. Yeah. Matter of time. And they did it and they did it.

Speaker 4:          00:28:38       Oh, it is going to create some fucking hilarious earthquakes and a lot of different relationships and marriages because people are going to have to define whether or not fucking a Hologram is a form of infidelity. Like you're going to have to make a rule for that and in your relationship, is it okay to fuck a Hologram? Not Alive, not a person, but looks like it's fucking you looking you right in the eyes, right in the fucking eyes. Oh my God, Dude. Yeah. It's pretty weird because your brain, when a Hologram is looking at you in the eyes in a loving way, your brain doesn't reject it. It's like, oh wow. I think this girl really likes me. Oh wait, it's a hologram. But in one millisecond you get this feeling of like strange connection, which is a, and again, we're in the most rudimentary parts of Vr, only apparently only.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       I just read this, it might've been a dated article, but only 100,000 people or so own an htc vive if that's drastically off you guys. I'm sorry, but not a lot of people have vr goggles right now. So not a lot of people. And there's a lot of us who are fucking ear beating people at parties who had clearly just don't want to hear about it any more than you want to hear about someone talking about it dream. But there's a huge group of people right now that are having some of the most psychedelic mind bending experiences through technology and they can't even talk about it or describe it to people because when you describe it, it's like you're talking about a dream, but you're like, no, this is happening to a lot of us right now. We're going into alternate dimensions via technology and hanging out there, enjoying it, experiencing the freedom, uh, from the confines of being constantly in an infinitely located in whatever physical space your body happens to be inhabiting to suddenly remove that weights and how I can pop these things on and instantly translocate to some art universe that some geniuses created.

Speaker 4:          00:30:56       Fuck around. Shoot Arrows, wander through minecraft, have sex with two girls who I always apparently going to throw out of my house if they didn't fuck me. That's what the point is. I have, which by the way, never do that. But in this universe, I guess that's what I go. Yeah, so the kind of rapey what? It's not rapey. It's just like, please, I don't have money for the rent. Can I suck your Dick? Oh, you know, it's her idea. Oh yeah. You're not saying you're not raping her. It's not like, look, you gotta you gotta give up some posts the other, otherwise I'm kicking you in the street. You could say it if you want into the porn. I mean, you could say whatever you want. Wait a minute. You told me you have a microphone, a microphone, but you can talk to it if you want to be a Weirdo, but okay.

Speaker 4:          00:31:42       How long before you can talk to it? Hello? Four. It talks back to you. Well that's you're going to look, you're looking at like a, so we got to figure out a way to either, I mean I imagine that probably exists in some rudimentary way for some kind of CGI style porn, but to be able to like instantaneously communicate with live video porn, you're going to need some kind of ai that I don't think we probably have just yet or we are probably on the PR, but yes, that will ask come. Oh, that's definitely going to happen. I've watched x Mckenna again on a plane the other day. I watched it for the second time. That's cool. It was just as good the second time. That movie freaks me out, man. Why? Because the girl's so beautiful and she's so, she's so attractive. Like you, you know, that guy you could see as much as he knew that she was a robot. As much as he knew that he wasn't a robot, as much as he knew that she was artificial, he was in love with her and she was amazing and it like she cared about

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       him and when she was talking to him for real, like when the lights went out and the camera was down, spoiler alert, and she was like, don't trust him. I'm like, this is like a real person, a real person. She's thinking like a person. It's a person. Yeah. And he's like completely locked into this idea that it's a person he's hipped and tie. It's a person. I mean I don't, this whole distinction between artificial intelligence and intelligence is the same as the distinction between virtual reality and reality. It's just like another human attempt to be in control of something. You want it, you want to say, Oh, I'll tell you if this is fucking reality or not. Oh, this is virtual reality. This isn't reality reality. But it's like, oh really? So reality is compartmentalized into places where there's, if something is created by a human, oh no, that's not real reality.

Speaker 2:          00:33:26       Even though humans are reality. Reality is reality. Intelligence is intelligence because the intelligence is inhabiting something that isn't the human vessel. It goes back to what we were talking about earlier, what, cause it's not in a fucking meat body now it's artificial intelligence. How is why intelligence is intelligence? Yeah, and again I think it goes back to what we were talking about earlier that we try to define intelligence by our own measures, like the ability to write something down, the ability to move. How about that? We, we have that inexorably connected to intelligence. You have to be able to move to show me your thinking and communicating. Right? Like despite what this woman was saying, the scientist on this radiolab podcast is that she goes, I don't want to say that there. She's like, it's hard to say that if they're intelligent, it's hard to, but what's going on is their net work closely resembles a brain, right?

Speaker 2:          00:34:19       The way it looks and also the way it's operating. They, it's as neuron like responses. Yeah. There's, there's data being passed back and forth, right. That we're just not, we, not you, not me. For sure. We don't, we're not doing any research, but these people, we are somewhat, I'm saying we as in humans, they're just figuring this out really recently. I think everything has a conscience or a consciousness. I think every, everything that you eat, and I think that obviously plants for the most part are like way less violent than animals. You know, like when you are taking in plants, it's just sent, it seems to make sense that it would be like a more peaceful existence. Like the way you think about it. Like you're, you're just consuming plants. Like glue it, all the animals that only consume plants. Right. They're all like really peaceful. Yes. But then the animals that consume animals and plants, they've got to get dirty. Yes. Those animals and the ones that only meet those are the scary ones. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Well it kind of makes sense. I mean when a percent you need different tools for taking down a deer than you do for eating a piece of Broccoli. Well, it's just, I think people are trying to like move away from

Speaker 5:          00:35:37       the system that requires the violence and like a part of that. The idea of that is to eat plants because like even if you're eating a life form your, you're, you're, you're less involved in violent activity. Like if you're eating meat, you're involved in violent activity, right? Some way, even fish, you're involved in some sort of violent activity. Those fish have to be, they don't just instantaneously die. They've got to be yanked into another dimension, beat over the head with wooden clubs thrown into ice checks, chasse with, they'll flop and gasp for air until they finally go still. I mean that's what happens when you eat fish, man.

Speaker 4:          00:36:16       You know, it is one thing that is very, they're all this indicates is how there's so much compassion inside of human beings because whether you eat meat or whether you eat a vegetarian diet, if you're thinking about this, it's really cool. That's one of the cool things about us is that we have this sense of like, man, yeah, this does seem to be a violent thing that I'm doing here. I know this thing I'm eating has suffered to some degree that I would never want anyone I know to suffer or myself as you know, I th th so w there's compassion there, man. And we want to live in a world where we don't hurt things. And if you do want to live in a world where you hurt things, well then you're probably in a lot of pain yourself, right? Yeah. But so then, but you get this is it man, this is the fucking Bhagavad Gita because the Bhagavad Gita starts with a warrior are June looking out on this, uh, this fucking massive army and sang to God the charioteer.

Speaker 4:          00:37:22       I see my friends here. I see fathers and teachers and men that I respect, uh, by killing them. Don't I destroy my own soul? Wouldn't it be better to go off into the forest and live as it renunciate than to, to gain all the wealth in the world, but to have the blood of my teachers on my hands. And this is the beginning of the bug of I get in, you would think because it's one of Gandhi's favorite books that the response would be, you're right, let's not kill, let's not fight. We're going to go in the woods. But the response, God says, you speak words of wisdom, but you do not understand. That's the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita. That's where it starts is here's why you fight. Here's why you have to kill. Sometimes. Here's why. There is action in the universe that will result in pain and suffering.

Speaker 4:          00:38:17       And this, uh, is to me the best like answer to all of this is a, when Krishna reveals his universal form is this cause called, here comes this monstrous thing and arginine is describing what he's, and this is the oppenheimer quote, Oh, home become death destroyer of worlds. And Arjun is saying, I see in your teeth the limbs of all humans being chewed and eaten, your consuming everything, your eating, everything is basically what he's saying. And then he says, can you please turn back into my friends? Cause it's so fucking intense to see that. And so that response is okay, let's stop killing everything. But look, you're getting eaten by the universe. No matter what you do, you're being grounded dust by the force of time. There is no escape from this. You are in the digestive tract of a being that is gradually transforming you into nothingness depending on what you want to believe, unless you think there's some eternal, perpetual soul, in which case the digestive system is freeing you from the uh, uh, the terrible and limited in closure of the human body.

Speaker 4:          00:39:42       Either way, man, we are being shifted and dramatic and beautiful way. And as that's happening to think that you can somehow not realize what you are, which is you are one of the digestive organs in the universe. You are deaf. No matter what you do, man, you are completely wiping beings out of the universe. It every single fucking second. If your immune system's working, those sweeties of burrowed into your fucking skin and gotten into your mucous membranes, you're wiping them out, your blood cells are heartlessly fucking killing them. And then maybe you had an ant on your counter when you drove your car. I'd say there's a 60% to 90% chance. You probably ran over some tiny little fucking bug that was walking across the street. You can't live in this universe without killing things and um, uh, and you two are being killed. So you are like, uh, in the [inaudible] you're like, uh, a little bit of stomach acid helping to dissolve a steak.

Speaker 4:          00:40:46       You're a little bit of the digestive process of the universe killing and uh, out putting energy from that destruction. That's just what everything is really not to like justify a meat diet. If you could become a vegetarian, do it, be a vegetarian if it drawn, if you're drawn to it, it is a more peaceful thing. We'll for sure factory farming is a giant issue for anybody with a conscience. Then when you get into other forms of acquiring meat, then things get more complicated because a, if you're talking about hunting in particular, that's not easy for everybody to do. And so it's almost impossible for everybody to do. Um, so then you'd have to have ethical farming and then you'd have to decide what is ethical, how they, what does ethical mean? Free range chicken, free range cows, free range chickens.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       Um, you know, and you didn't have to decide that there's certain cycle of life involved here and then you're willing to take part in it for your own health. You're going to decide I'd like this, my body functions better on this, so I'm going to, I'm going to allow this to happen or, or help it. Participant, yeah, he'll participate in it. But um, I think when you see a bear eat a salmon, that bear is not thinking for a fucking second about the feelings of that salmon. It's just holding it down and tearing it apart with no hesitation whatsoever. When we reap, let us from the ground. Are we doing a more complicated version of that? Are we pretending that this thing is this non feeling nonthinking thing because it doesn't move and it can't send emails. But is it possible that all these things that we call life, all these things have a consciousness. Everything does. Squirrels, people, monkeys, fucking Alfalfa.

Speaker 4:          00:42:30       Oh yeah. All that shit. It's, yeah, it's a, it's a, this is what I was thinking as I've been doing vr, having so many philosophical thoughts based on this incredible technology. So this is what I started thinking is that human, all living things are like organic virtual reality goggles, right? So like a squirrel is a, is like a kind of virtual reality goggle that the universe is gazing through in the form of a squirrel's reality, right? So this consciousness, this intelligence, it's like an omnipresent force. And every living thing is like a faucet that its life is this intelligence coming through and it's spreading itself based on the energetic system of the particular conduit that it's coming through. So a living squirrel is a portal that is opened up to the intelligence of the universe temporarily. And when that intelligence flows through the squirrel, the way electricity runs through a motherboard, uh, then it's odd.

Speaker 4:          00:43:36       It's, it's animated, right? And so when the squirrel dies, that it's not as though the intelligence is gone. It's just that that particular conduit shots, while there's a billion other conduits in any biom filled with that intelligence, pouring through it, um, and behaving according to the way, whatever the thing is that it's coming through in the same way that if you have a, if you have a different ai programs with different codes, it's still processing the same energy. It's just the energy is being transformed based on whatever the specific system is, you know. So when we meet, we're in a weird way eating the virtual reality goggles that some thing was that infinity was using to experience reality and that reality that it infinity was experiencing through the vr goggles that you're eating inside your bond was not a great fucking, uh, experience, you know, so composed in those, in that Goggle, in that life form that you're eating. This is what the Hari Krishna say is all the fear, all the terror, all the, the momentum of that being's life somehow gets encoded into the, uh, atomic structure of the meat that you're consuming. And so you take a little bit of that suffering into you and that degrades your life in some slight way, but totally me.

Speaker 3:          00:45:04       Makes Sense. Totally makes sense that there's something that gets through it. I mean, why would we assume that your diet isn't, I mean, if you're eating biological particles, why would we assume that they have no influence on us? Like we would think that there, we just know. I just, I broke it down to protein. Yeah. Water. And that's it. There's no, no chicken suffering in there at all.

Speaker 4:          00:45:27       No, I ain't checking software. No Way. Not a, not a trace of it, but why not? All a dullness? Just a dull chicken suffering that you get in your mouth. Yeah, just a kiss. Delicious chicken. But there's an undertone of existential horror and my chicken waxy film on the inside of your mouth. Yeah, just chicken sadness. Yeah. Oh Man. I can remember like when, when I was a kid, we didn't fucking, you know, like you kind of knew the animals were like the people just were a lot like I'm reading fucking listen to the audio book rather of Moby Dick, uh, the Frank Mueller narration. You ever read that book who's Frank? Mueller? Frank Mueller, uh, is the guy, is the Vo actor who narrated the dark tower series by Stephen King. And he is the best. And so I guess there's no way I'm fucking reading moby Dick, but listening to someone who understands what he's reading helps you understand it and uh, cause he puts the inflection in the right place, the inflections are in the right place, and he's clearly some kind of super genius who just gets moby Dick.

Speaker 4:          00:46:35       And he understands every single fucking passage that Melville endlessly writes about the varied, the deepest details of whales, man Melville fucking love whales. And the book is like a sort of portal into, before they knew that whales are mammals, right? So, you know, we thought they were fucking fish Leviathan, right? Isn't that funny that we make that distinction? Let's talk about that. I like sat there fish, fuck them. Well, they're mammals. They're ass, right? Right, right. We can't do that. We got, we got weird teams. Other teams weren't. Okay. So I'll answer to that. If to use the virtual reality goggle example, let's imagine there's like 15 different virtual reality goggles on the table that represent a kind of spectrum of um, technological advancement. So here we've got a, I don't know, remember the old, you used to have those like, uh, those stupid view finders you could flip through and look at it.

Speaker 4:          00:47:33       Okay. So on one side we have a view finder and on the other side we've got some shit that doesn't even exist yet. Some neural interface, you put it on a harmonic magnetic field, interacts with your brain and you not only go into a location, but you experienced the memories, emotions, thoughts, and dreams of the Avatar within the game. You literally become the figure that's on the other side of the spectrum, right? So here we have this sort of like spectrum of potential experience. I think it would be safe to say that, uh, the experience of a Broccoli, right? Just based on the TAC in there versus the experience of like a, I don't know, a fucking mit student genius who's like, come healthy. I'd say that you could say that there's a varying levels of experience as to what is being experienced. Who's to say, now that I say it, I think I'm totally wrong. I'm sorry for the rant. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:48:40       As a, at the very end of it, there was some part of me, he's like, just shut up, man. That's wrong. That's not it. So forgive me you guys. I try with that one. You just, it, it flopped. In my own brain. They don't all land. They don't own the land. If they did, it wouldn't be fun. It wouldn't be fine. But I will admit when they don't land in that, definitely. I think you're right, man. Why do we make the distinction? It's like God damn weird distinction. I mean, it's an intelligence distinction. Yeah. We just decided to fish a stupid as fuck. But you know what? They're not. Here's the, here's where they're not. Here's one thing we eat all the time. That is probably a smart as a monkey. And that's an octopus. Oh, I know. Yeah. We talked to us all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       They are crazy smart. Have you ever seen the new video that they put out of an octopus going through a key or a whole rather than just the size of a quarter? Yeah, man. Yeah, I did see that. It's crazy. It's amazing what they can do to their bodies. This is insane. And yeah, Mckenna loved them. Right? He was like in love with Octopi. Is that the plural Octopi? That's a good question. He was in love with it is he thought that they were like the ability to have multiple appendages and, and, and the crazy camouflage abilities they have would combine to really, um, open up new levels of communication that humans don't have. Cause it seems like he was a, he was a little frustrated by the limitation of the human vocabulary and the way we emote things to articulate the universe. So it'd be nice to have a bunch of different limbs that had no bones that you can turn any which way while shifting colors that beats fucking emoticons by shot man. I mean they can change color. They shoot ink into the air and he, he

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       was one that I first heard speculate that the ink, when they shoot ink into the air, that it might be like a racer fluid. Like look how small that hole is and look at this big ass octopus. Get through this tiny hall. I mean you would look at that hole and you would have like, there's no way, but these things, not only can they get out of a hole like that, but they can walk on land for long periods of time, climb back up into their fish tanks, lift the lid, get inside. I mean they're aliens man. That's, I mean that might as well be on another planet. We're just used to it because it's on earth. The thing is a giant bulbous head, long moveable arms. He knows how to unscrew jars and he's got like a kind of like cool, relaxed look on his face. Like he's, he's definitely relaxed. They're emotionless. They're very strange. It's a very strange being. It's very different than a fish and uh, but it lives with fish, so fuck it. I mean, they're probably a smart as whales,

Speaker 4:          00:51:26       everything is alive. That's the ultimate thing though. That's the final place you got to get to is that you are a part of a super organism that is stretching through time in the form of every generation of thing that ever lived. Right. And it's currently like, it's like this being that has an infinite number of appendages that represent all living forms of life on earth. And just like the same way that like you investigate a thing. All these impinj appendages have wrapped around the planet and they're probing, probing, probing, probing, probing the planet. So it's like every living thing is the very end of an interdimensional superintelligent appendage. You know, this is kind of like the, uh, uh, hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy where he said that mice are just the ends of the tentacles of his inner dimensional creatures studying scientists that laboratory mice, he was a fucking genius.

Speaker 4:          00:52:33       But, um, in the same way, when you look at like every single living being on earth is actually protruding from, uh, you know, generation after generation of being that stretches back to the beginning of organic life on planet earth. So it's like earth suddenly gets wife. How, who the fuck knows my theory aliens? But who knows? Maybe it just randomly happen. Who knows? But so suddenly springing from the earth or these very rudimentary organisms that over the course of millennia gradually stretched out and changed to become various types of devices, to study the crevices, crannies, and, and an air of this planet until eventually it became monkeys and the monkeys became people. And now we're like a very advanced scope that is peering into the atomic and subatomic level of the fucking thing. But when you look at a squirrel's life, eagles life, uh, fucking, uh, salmon being eaten by a bear's life, it's interesting to consider that what you're seeing is an infinite number of scopes through which something that appears to be either investigating this dimension or just enjoying being in it is coming through. You know, that seems to be what's happening. That is an idea that gets echoed in, um,

Speaker 3:          00:53:57       uh, and like some eastern philosophies and, uh, some, uh, it's, it's an interesting take on it for sure. What would, what's definitely happening is there is some consumption going on. Everything's consuming something. Yeah. That's what this is the, one of the things about this radio lab podcast, it was so fascinating where was talking about these fun guide devouring microscopic insects and um, also like literally tapping into rocks for minerals. It's really, really intense stuff. And having this intense relationship with these plants where they're feeding off the root system and the root systems are feeding them and they're feeding the root systems. They're exchanging sugar and uh, and minerals. Yeah. It's really crazy, dude. I mean, it's really, really bizarre. They were talking about miles and miles of these microscopic fung fungi in the soil in a tiny piece of soil and miles and miles.

Speaker 4:          00:54:51       Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The mycelium, right? Yeah. So like, so when you, okay, so everything's eating itself, but if you imagine that what you're looking at is actually only one half of the thing, because we can't see into the nothingness that happens after death, then it could be that you're actually looking at one, just one part of a process, right? You're seeing just what you're, you're seeing a limited part of an infinite process that's happening where death is just one piece of it. But the thing that dies doesn't, um, isn't annihilated it.

Speaker 7:          00:55:31       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:55:31       No, go ahead. It's not, it doesn't go. So the idea is it's like, okay, what you are is a thing growing out of time. Right? You're growing from that, which is not into that which is, or that which is not known to that. Which is is nice because where are you? Where were you before you died? Who knows? I know you, you're born before you were born. Oh, right. Same thing. According to some religions, but uh, so when you look at that as part of a continuum, right? Instead of just like you are born and then you die and then nothingness, if you look at it as part of energetic continuum of which we can only witness this particular part of the continuum, we don't have the technology yet to peer into the other part of the continuum. So if you look at it as an actual cycle, then the brutality of the universe becomes a little less significant because you realize like, oh no, it's just like things diving out of the nothingness into somethingness are returning to the nothingness.

Speaker 4:          00:56:31       Then the same way a dolphin jumps up and goes back down into the sea. That's what we're doing. Only when we dive into time, we take on a form. When we dive out of time, we become the formless and then we come back out of time again. That's reincarnation. It's reincarnation is, I'm sorry if I've said on this podcast before, but reincarnation is like a fucking dolphin trick only in this case, the trick that you're doing is called your incarnation and the particular way that you live, whether it's as it is for most people, a kind of failure cause how the fuck are you going to figure out what to do when you dive into time for such a temporary fleeting lifetime, like to suddenly to be able to do back flips and shit. It's maybe you're not gonna be able to do that right away, but you dive out of time or out of nothingness, come into somethingness incarnate, incarnate, incarnate. Here we are as a being have a life and then you go back into the nothingness again. And so the people that we are most amazed by in history or just people who did really awesome tricks where they're temporary human current incarnation is they came jumping out of the nothingness. That's what we're in right now, man. Just a temporary transitory state of harmonized Adams that have become aware of themselves, that are about to go through of incredible energetic shift where you become nothing and then maybe become something again for infinity.

Speaker 5:          00:58:01       We have a real hard time having the perspective of your body turning into bacteria or you couldn't back to, you're consuming your body when you die of that not being a bad thing, that it's a part of life and that you will be conscious inside that bacteria and then maybe your consciousness leaves this and travels with you with your cells and your DNA as you're being consumed. Yeah. And then it becomes a part of some gigantic matrix and that's what maybe that's what you're tapping into when you're doing things like dmt. Yeah. When you hit that well of consciousness, whatever the fuck that is that you hit when you, you run into that sea of reality. Yeah. When I say reality like this, but just intense God, like no bullshit. Like there's, it knows everything. There's no bullshit. It's like you and you, you, you have to abandon all your worldly thoughts.

Speaker 5:          00:58:54       Yeah. Abandon all your ideas of life and death and ego and just give in and be one with the whole thing. And maybe that's what we do all the time when we're sleeping, man. I mean it's entirely possible that what we don't remember is existing in that realm and that that realm is something that were just shut off from because for us to get done what we have to get done with this monkey body, you can't be fucking contemplating that all the time cause you're not going to get shit done. You're getting, you get, you're going to be your, you're going to be philosophical,

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       you're going to be too confused. You're going to be so blown away by the images of that other world. You can't handle it. So you just, the reality of life just completely takes over.

Speaker 4:          00:59:34       Dude, you didn't, I mean I don't, I don't think you meant to do it, but you are take, you waited when you said that the essence of so many different religious systems, which is that here is this Omni present, infinite ever replenishing creative matrix of intelligence that is so much bigger than I am. It's incomprehensible and an end, like you said, you have to let go of all your worldly ideas, your thoughts, your ego. You have to let your ego die because what the fuck are you going to do in the face of that thing? Are you going to hold on to the stuff you're proud of? Are you going to hold onto the, the victories that you've achieved in your mind, newt flickering human incarnation? When you're in the presence of the source of victory in the universe, what are you going to do there? What's the correct reaction to have if a thing like that? We're real. And so depending on what religious system you subscribe to those, all of those are answers to that question. You know, and you hear the answer coming up, uh, in a similar way usually, which is you serve it. You try to become a servant to it because, because what else are you going to fucking do? Are you gonna you gonna are you gonna teach it? Are you going to show it how to do something?

Speaker 3:          01:00:58       Are you going, what are you going to show? Hey guys, relax. I'm here. Uh, I know you've been waiting for a long time. Infinity. Finally, I'm amongst you with my wisdom, my 47 years on planet earth as a tire salesman who finally does dmt for the first time. Everybody sit down. Oh, got it. You come back. Yeah. Yeah. Let's start with roses. I liked the color of them, but maybe we make it a brighter red. What do you think? How about make it so dear? Don't want to eat them. My mom, she has a fucking garden. She's always mad. The deer is eating them roses. Yeah. This is, this is the, um, so this is,

Speaker 4:          01:01:45       yeah, this is why I really love this. Bhakti Yoga, which is a cause it like takes that idea. There is a super intelligent creative force in the universe. And the word for it is Bhagavan and it basically means maximum everything. So ultimate beauty, ultimate intelligence, ultimate attractiveness. Ultimate, ultimate love. It's the ultimate of ultimate's. Right? So this thing has, um, inadvertently, I, it depends on what version of it. Probably not inadvertently, but this thing has a kr, this, it's so potent that the way it's interacting with time is that it's breaking into an infinite number of pieces that have all become semi or super aware. So it's consciousness is dispersed itself through its creation and every single minute element, like some fractal, every single little piece of it is a possessor of this infinite consciousness. And so that infinite consciousness is the source of love. And um, it's basically, uh, let's you fall in love with it if you want to and it loves you too, which is the, what's really trippy to imagine.

Speaker 4:          01:03:06       This is a thought experiment, man. Imagine that thing you just described, that infinite fucking thing, the no bullshit thing that demands that you drop your history like a fucking old nasty bag of shit. Imagine if that thing also was aware of you completely and also loved you. Imagine that shit man. That's the craziest idea ever. That's a crazy fucking idea. That's better than you know, like when you like kind of like a girl and you start thinking like maybe you don't do this because you're a fucking muscular super billionaires. It's the host the UFC. But somebody like me, when I, if a girl starts liking you, you start thinking like, holy shit does this girl, I think this girl likes me. I think this beautiful, incredibly beautiful girl likes me. Could this be, that's the beginning of all love songs, right? That's the beginning of, of like all human happiness is holy shit.

Speaker 4:          01:04:07       The girl I like likes me back. I think she likes me. Holy Shit. I think she's falling in love with me. This incredibly beautiful girl. So Bhakti Yoga is that exact concept transferred to the universe. So now you're like, wait a minute. This entire, the source of all things in the universe has a personality and it seems to love me. Not No fucking tame way. Not In like the way that you might hear, like Jesus loves you and then you imagine it being like, that means you could go over to his house and sit down and have like a boring cup of tea and leave, you know, like that, that, that kind of love. No, this is a fucking wild, savage, unpredictable. Love the way your best friend loves you or the way that like a comedian loves you, which is like, you don't know what the fuck's going to happen.

Speaker 4:          01:05:02       It's not the way the comedian loves you. Yeah. You know, like comedians are going to do weird shit. If you're friends with Comedians, you're going to get a lot of like weird fucking pictures sent to you. You know, on a regular basis. You're going to get people calling you and playing tricks on you from time to time for no other reason than just to do it. Right. But they love you. They fucking love you. That's what's behind it. So in the same way, this is the concept, it's not a team kind of love. It'll kill you, like it'll eat you, but it's still loves you. And it'll eat you because it knows that you're just a fucking pair of virtual reality goggles. You're just a temporary flickering thing that's going to keep going on forever.

Speaker 5:          01:05:43       This ego in the survival mechanism is what makes us think that it's more important to root for our team. Like we have teams, right? So first of all were teen prime mate. Don't eat any primates. Yep. Once you get past team primary were teen mammal. So if you have a choice between killing a gigantic fish or killing a gigantic mammal that you thought was a fish, you got to kill the fish so you can kill fucking blue Marlin's all day long. Bring those bitches in, chop up and the stakes. But don't make oil for lamps. I love Moby Dick. That's fucked up. Fucking oil out of the suite, the bad guy. You're the bad guy. And I agree. You know, for whatever reason, especially with uh, with whales, I have a thing for whales, have a thing for whales and orcas and dolphins. I'm fascinated by them, like legitimately perplexed.

Speaker 5:          01:06:32       I think that it's entirely possible, but both by, both with both dolphins and orchids, that they're just as smart as us. They just don't express it the same way. They have a, they have a different, different kinds of existence. They don't need, they don't want to dominate other than controlling food. They just want to have food. And once they have food, I, you know, I don't think, I just think when you, when you listen to a scientist talk about their dialects and the fact that the pod stays together for life and that they, uh, they form these tight bonds and they communicate over great distances with sound frequencies and these complex languages that they recognize are different in different areas. So they recognize they're similar sounds, but there's a dialect to it. They still don't know what the fuck they're saying. And part of the reason why we don't want know what they're saying, it's just like how we were talking about emojis being like a form of hieroglyphs.

Speaker 5:          01:07:22       I don't think we can understand the context of communication. When you live in the fucking ocean and you kill fish with your face all day. I think what we would think of is, where is your house? Do you guys have cable? How do you guys find out about, you know, when the movies are playing, know that this idea of communication to us, like what, what they're trying to do is locate each other, let each other know their moods, let each other know their whole right. Let each other know. But we think that, that, that's rudimentary in comparison to our complex system of sounds and very repeatable sounds that we can all express back and forth to each other. But we just like emojis, like what they're doing, dressing themselves in, in a, in a way that they all understand. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:08:08       Yeah man. And don't forget they have an awareness of, of part of the larger part of the earth. We don't know what the fuck is down there. Right. That's one of the, that's one of the, uh, moby Dick right after the spoiler. They kill the fucking whale moby Dick back right after the, in the description, the description of the way they kill this fucking thing. The way they did it back then, which is you know, you getting a ship, you roll up to the thing, there's a harpoon year, he's got a fucking Harpoon, he's got to sing it at the thing and then you've got a tire it out. Real it. And this is a fucking whale, right? This is a Leviathan, right? You're just a little fucking human in a fucking boat and you're like nailing this thing with a harpoon. Finally, when it gets tired enough, you have to find its heart.

Speaker 4:          01:08:54       Oh my jam, the Harpoon into its heart. And then basically like fuck the whole with a Harpoon, just jab it in and out of that fucking hole until finally, this is description makes you want to cry. It's so awful. Finally like the whale out of its blow hole at like shrieks like uh, like car breaks or something. Like it's screaming in pain and then it just blows chunks of guts and lung and heart out of its own glow. And then it fucking dies. Then you got to get it back to the ship. You tie it to this side of the ship. Sharks start feasting on the fucking thing. So you have like sharks and your God damn whale. It's somebody's job to get lower down with a Harpoon and kill the fucking sharks. And Melville Describes Melville, describes killing sharks. He's like, you will stat, you watched the hard paneer stab the shark.

Speaker 4:          01:09:46       The shark will start eating its own inch rails cause it'll, it'll just start eating itself. And then just like tying itself up into a, not as it eats itself in a frenzy. That's our Melville describes it. Those poor fucking whales man. But after the, uh, they kill a whale. Ahab, Captain Ahab, poor sad, Captain Ahab. He comes out and he like does a funeral for the whales head. And he like says like, what have you seen down there? What have you seen the graves of millions of sailors, the wrecked ships that no one will ever know or there, that's what a whale see. So they just have this awareness that we don't like. We'll never know what the fuck's down there. We hardly can. Yeah. We don't know what like, I mean the earth is three quarters water, right? Yeah. So the, what's the low? Yeah. What's below the water is a two thirds or three guide on.

Speaker 4:          01:10:44       Now there's a three, five and measured lately. Whatever it is, it's a lot, right? It's a giant chunk of the earth. Yes. All water. That's why it blew the, the underneath stuff we so rarely see. I mean, do we see it? Is that we do we see at 1% of what we see above ground? The um, Oh God, I hate to always talk about it, but a brief history, nearly everything he describes it as like, and this could be wrong, I don't know, but what we know about the ocean, imagine if someone took like six tractors and drop them in the middle of Middle America and they drove around for a few nights with their lights on at night. Some, some description like that. Can't remember. But it's like it's, it's that limited because getting a fucking thing underneath all that pressure, it's not going to break down. Getting out there in the first place, you know, to get the thing down that can survive that pressure. Forget it. Pasta takes a

Speaker 5:          01:11:38       special kind of crazy person that's willing to get in a submarine. Oh, oh Jesus fucking Christ. I think I'd rather go to space. I think I'd rather go to space and be stuck at the bottom of the fucking Osha and then see a drop of water on the side of the wall going, what is that? What is that? What's going on? Shit, man. What is that noise? Did you hear that noise here? Yeah. Twinkie. And you know, it's just like a fucking beer. Can I, one of those? You ever see a stripper crush a beer can with their tin. They hold a beer can up and they have one of them whopper tits, like those double f jammies and they hold it by the base because those tits are always like, you know, they're, they're sort of like a, like a ball on the end of a, an old rope.

Speaker 5:          01:12:17       Right. You know, cause you have the big round ridiculous sized implants and they hold the beer. Can they just molly whopped up beer can and crush it. That's how I would feel if I heard a clink clink clink that I knew that eventually the thousands of pounds of pressure was just going to smush that, that tank. I just, that's a fucked up way to diamond here. They go, look, look, look, look behind you. Boom. Oh Wow. I didn't know this. They do this boom boom, which is crushing them with her tits. That has to hurt. We'll get Steve Harvey. Hmm. There you go. Wow. Now you know it's a thing. Now I know. So that's what I think of when I think about submarines. You think when she did that?

Speaker 4:          01:13:08       Yeah. Man. You think she did that the first time she did that? She was angry?

Speaker 5:          01:13:14       No, she was on meth the first time for sure. Is that what she said? No, that's what I would guess. I think a lot of girls have done that. That's a trick. That's like the when you not, but she keeps sucking. That's that mixed boobs. Crushing beards. First girl to crush a beer can with her boob was on match. No, she's probably a real girl. First of all, like she had real boobs. I mean, not just a real girl. Yeah. You're all real girls by the way, and everybody's a real girl. Yeah. If you want to be a real girl, you're a real girl. Right? Right. But like how many guys are broken beer cans with their dick? How about zero? Tits are way more powerful and Dick in that regard, and what guys ever like held a beer can down and smashed it with his hog oak has a greater man than anybody in this room. Plus, especially if he does it right side up and he gets the lip of the, the beer can the thin park slams against his dick with the kind of force that's required to bend a beer can. You're going to

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       crush your deck, you're going to hurt your Dick. I gotta disagree with you, man. I think he becomes, I think he becomes the hero if he's like, if he's tied up and he's got to use his dick and the beer can as a form of escape device, like at that point it becomes more heroic than just, but you're right. I mean, no matter what, if you smash a beer can with your cock, then you join some invisible, more elite than the Illuminati. I bet it's smaller than the seven families that control everything. Do you think there's like a 14 inch club was all dudes were 14 to talks just hanging out.

Speaker 2:          01:14:51       There's gotta be more than one dude on the planet that has more than a foot long duck. Right? If there's girls that have kids like that, and obviously those are fake, but people are weird, right? People are built strange. There's guys that are seven feet tall. There's people that are five foot one. There's a whole bunch of people in between and someone out there as a 14 inch Dick for sure. Like how many of them? Well I mean based on my own experience. Three and they're all assholes. But well there was that one guy who kept getting caught at the TSA because he has his, his, his hog is gigantic. So he, I keep saying hog cause it's fun. Yeah. Why is you calling her a log? What are you 12? Yes. Um, he's got a like a fucking sock. Like a rolled up sock.

Speaker 2:          01:15:36       Yeah. That's what is his hog is we know the story or we've probably talked about in the park, you know the story of John Malcovich, right. Being John Malkovich comp, John Malcovich the actor. Right, right. So that supposedly they had to get him a body double and a nude scene in a movie because his cock is so gigantic that they thought nobody would believe that was a human's Dick. So they had to get a body devil with a smaller cock to, uh, have him stand in. Because his penis is so large that it would disrupt the flow of the narrative to the guy who's telling you this suck your Dick. He'd said it while he was sucking my Dick and the WHO I believe our biggest dangers, his dick, a survey they're looking at. I think it is. It feels lucky enough phonies. They look up as if that's confirmed somewhere.

Speaker 2:          01:16:27       I think it's confirmed. I have a feeling that's what's called a rumor. I have a feeling John Malcovich has a great publicist. Yeah. He's like this story. That's a good move. Well, if I, I could imagine he would have a giant hug. James Woods supposedly has a giant hug. That's the word he's telling him about it. He's talked about it pretty openly. Trump trump has a giant one did. He says, fine. He says it's fine in comparison to his hands, but it's the fact that the guy's running for president and he was joking around about his dick not being tiny. That is hilarious. I don't, you know, I don't know if he's going to make the best leader of the free world, but, uh, I welcome someone who's willing to make a dick joke while they're running for president. I welcome that. Well, it's going, it's like,

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       it's gonna be, uh, it's going to be a, it's going to be really, um, interesting. You know, I was thinking, we were talking about the fucking elections anyway, man. And, uh, you know, what's causing all the trouble right now? What? It's this, it's, this is all technological disruption. Like we're looking at, this is all a result of technology. I was thinking like, what's the, um, what's the F if, okay. If you could like locate the problem, right? It's the, I don't mean to jump from a damn fantastic conversation about an enormous cox to some kind of political shit ever worry about where our conversations go lover. So thank you. So, so, uh, the, the, the, the, what you're looking at here, man, is, uh, what Ray Kerr, this is a quote from Ray Kurzweil, which is things aren't getting worse. Our information's getting better, right? And so with Hillary Clinton, who is a career politician, right?

Speaker 4:          01:18:15       And we've all known since we were young. Most people, I think when they think about politicians, they don't think those are some honest people. Those politicians, they usually, you're telling the truth. I think most of his think politicians, they lie, they warp things, they fabricate things. They use a form of deception to gain control of various power structures. That's what the animal does. So that's not new information when you find out that Hillary Clinton and the DNC, and I don't know if they completely connected those two, but when you find out that they, they, they were not, uh, they didn't do what they're supposed to do. They helped Hillary Clinton become the Democratic nominee and they actively tried to fuck up Bernie Sanders. Right. That's creepy. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       What? It's not a new thing. I know, but it is creepy. It's creepy. And it's even more creepy that the woman who was in charge resigns and then immediately gets hired a great shot and got a great job. Hillary Clinton's like, fuck it. I'm going to hire you and it won't do anything. She hires her. She's so fucking unafraid of what's going to happen that she hires the woman who did such shitty thing. She had to resign booed off stage, hires her into her fucking party cause she's like, fuck you, I'm getting elected. You're not stopping it. Right. But this is again tech. It's gangster too though. It's also a move in on her part where, I mean she's looking at like what trump is calling her crooked hillary. Yeah. It's a gangster move to hire a woman like that. Like right in front of you. Yeah. Wasserman Schultz top post mission accomplished the DNC. But this is, this is not a new, this is not a new thing man. This is what exactly, well let's go over this. Cause what exactly did they do that's so awful about Bernie? What did they do? So

Speaker 4:          01:20:08       they apparently came up with a way to disseminate information to the press, highlighting certain aspects of Bernie Sanders that would be unappealing to the voter. And they did

Speaker 5:          01:20:16       this. And this has all been confirmed. Can you, can you, uh, Google that? Find out what they actually said. Let's find out what the actually summarize the Wiki leave. We think they're being a bunch of whiny bitches, but for sure they wanted him look, she's got way deeper arms in politics. She's way more connected than he is for sure. There's, and this is what we're seeing too, there's like a big part of being a political candidate is how many favors do you have? How many people you are you connected to, how, how deep does your influence go? And obviously her influence didn't just sit within her are her own little group of people that were working for it had gotten to the DNC itself. So she's, she's deeply embedded in this whole system, whether it's because of friendships or ideologies or people just wanted her, she's the chosen one.

Speaker 5:          01:20:58       Whatever reason, whatever deals were made or whoever, who knows who knows what it is. But when you find out that an organization that's supposed to be the head, it's supposed to be, if we, if everything was on the up and up, it's supposed to be objective and looking for what the people want or as the best party. But no, they're actually actively steering, which is massively corrupt and kind of scary because if these people are deciding to steer an entire party yeah. Which is 50% of a political process because there's no, look, you've, we've got libertarian party for the first time, people are taking Gary Johnson. Seriously, it's going to do that. Um, uh, a town hall debate on Wednesday or town hall, one of those town hall things on Wednesday on CNN, but for the most part it's Democrats or Republicans in most people's eyes. So what they're essentially doing is rigging half of that process. Yup. That's carrie that we just, we don't think anything's wrong with that, but we put Martha Stewart in jail for not telling exactly the truth about where she bought and sold stocks or whatever the fuck

Speaker 4:          01:21:55       we eat about. We do think something's wrong about it, but we can't do anything about it. We do think something's wrong, but right now, okay, so if like that institution is corrupt and if the Republican institution is in some ways corrupt, I think it might be safe to say, and I don't think too many people would be outraged at the idea that there is a institutionalized corruption in the entire American political system and it's very similar to the problem that happens in bike racing. If one mother fucker regs their bike or gets on fucking doping stuff that can't be detected. If you want to have a fair advantage, you've got a regular bike and start doping to, or the person who rides their bike will always win. So if politics is a competition, which it clearly is, and if members of the competition are using nefarious means to achieve their goals, which they clearly are, which they clearly are, then that would imply that if you wanted to survive in that system, you would also have to use nefarious means dom, dom,

Speaker 4:          01:23:06       and this is not new. This is old, old, old shit. What's new is technology. What's new is now people like Julian assange are shining a light on the corruption and his whole ideas. If I reveal this information, it will force reform via the outrage of the people who are supposed to be represented by a person who's breaking the law. That's his idea. We need reform. And right now we're at the point where it's very similar to when you're in a family and this is one of the worst things can fucking happen, man. In a family. If there is somebody who's molesting somebody, it happens all the time where, uh, a father or a brother, we'll start fucking molesting somebody, right? But in people in the family know it, but they don't do anything about it. Because to talk about what GRANDPA does every couple of years means that complete disintegration of the fucking family and apocalypse for the family and the same way is more of these revelations become clear, which we always knew.

Speaker 4:          01:24:15       But you could always float into a happy place and be like, Nah, I'm just being a conspiracy dude. I'm sure the stuff they're doing up on Capitol Hill is all fair and square. I, you know, you can just believe it guiding. You just pretend to believe. Now it's like, well now you're wrong. Look, hey, here's the fucking proof and here's going to be more proof and there's going to be more proof and there's going to be more proof until finally the American people are going to have to either just be like, oh, I'm just going to believe that fours three and three is four because I have a nice comfortable life and I don't want to fucking deal with this shit, man. I'm just going to trust the banks because the banks light, they like money and at my job and as long as I keep my job, I'll keep my benefits.

Speaker 4:          01:25:00       Yeah, and by the way, ps, man, when you consider that, it's like there's something pragmatic about that. As sad as it is. There's as, as, as depressing it is, is it is, but they're, the real awful problem is that this country, I think is that they get metaphysical machine that was built by some very intelligent people who understood the energy flow that comes through a society and the elections were supposed to be an outlet valve for the pressure that builds up when people feel that they're being repressed. Right. And if you start fucking with that output valve by putting up fake politicians that don't truly represent the people and hope that the people will believe that they have elected these people, if you put two shitty choices in front of us and we're supposed to look at that and be like, okay, everything's fine, then you're, you're missing the point, which is that there is an energetic system that needs to get released.

Speaker 4:          01:26:00       You know, at some point the energy's got to out. If it doesn't go out, you get revolution. That's the way the energy goes out the wrong way. The idea is let's fucking the American revolution, brutal, bloody, awful fucked. These geniuses, many of them freemasons got together and they were like, you know what? Is there a way that we can program history so that a society doesn't destroy itself intermittently with a fucking revolution? Because if we could do that, we'll build one of the most powerful never ending societies on earth because we figured out a way to outflow the pressure that builds up. So when you start fucking with a goddamn political system and pretend that everything's gonna be okay, you are missing, I think the the point which is that people who are very smart, maybe a lot smarter than then the politicians we have today recognize something, built a thing and said, let's just trust the fucking people. Let's trust the people release the steam and while ah, everything runs according to plan. Now the gears are a little fucking gummed up man. A little, yeah, a little how gummed up? How gummed up the gears.

Speaker 5:          01:27:14       Really crazy gummed up. I think this is the first time we're realizing how much money people make by running for president. How much, you know, money it costs to run for president. But how much money top political figures make and donations and in speeches. Yeah. Have you, have you paid attention to how much they make and speeches like Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton, you may, may bribes. Well, this is what it is. These corporations can fund various, uh, universities. They can donate money to all sorts of different programs where they would have someone speak and they can decide who gets to speak and who doesn't get to speak. And they also have like the Clinton Foundation, people donate money into that. They don't donate fuck loads of money. Now it's her, all these things, but hold on a second says all these things, what they are essentially, or you're, you're paying someone to speak for an hour and you're gonna give him $750,000.

Speaker 5:          01:28:07       And you want me to pretend that that's normal. That's crazy. And what does this person do? They are a public servant. Okay. Okay. So there are public servant, and while they're publicly serving, they're also making $750,000 to talk. Huh? That seems a little crazy, doesn't it? Like why do they make so much money to do that and who was paying them and what, what, what do you have to benefit by having them come and read some nonsense, bullshit, boring speech. A friend mine went to see Rudy Giuliani after post nine one one when he was on his victory tour, he was on like a lap of the country doing these, these speeches because everybody loved him because he saved the world during, you know, September 11th he was the guy who stood strong, everybody like wow, rudy Giuliani, he's a good man. So he rode that and he started doing these speeches and would come to colleges and a friend of mine went to see him and said it was dog shit that he just, it was a boring ass like reading with no passion.

Speaker 5:          01:29:00       It a chick chain. Go in there and say some nonsense about freedom and the American way and terrorism or whatever the fuck and first responders and just there wasn't anything real. It was just, it was a performance. It was like he was doing a one man show all across the country for exorbitant sums of money. God, that'd be fucking great if he was actually doing a one man show, hundred and $53 million in bill and Hillary Clinton speaking fees documented. This is just, Jamie just pulled this up. That dad is stunning. That's s dunning amount of money and what we're 15 years is from 2001 to about now it's it still it's more than, yeah, that's mean. Well, it's perfect then because that's $10 million a year. This is more recent of what she, she had 20 225,000 that's our standard fee. Oh my God. She prefers a private jet and prefers a gulfstream four 50 or larger. The memo outlines had Clinton requires travel by private jet. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:30:04       You know, it'd be fucking cold out. Is this like what if you are like a mad billionaire? Could you just get Hillary Clinton to come to your house and like just speak to you for an hour and your living room?

Speaker 5:          01:30:14       This is fascinating. Hold up, scroll back down there. She made $21 million doing what? She made 21 point $6 million in speeches and just under two years.

Speaker 4:          01:30:25       That's amazing. That's incredible. That's so much money. She's like a kind of like crazy animal that you can like lure with money. Like you can actually, if you have enough money you can learn to Hillary Clinton into your house. Like you just have to lay it out. She'll show up. Like if I put carrots in my backyard, I'll probably get a rabbit or two. If you have enough money you can get politicians to come and start feeding it your mansion. Where do you, when does it become,

Speaker 5:          01:30:51       when does it become bribe? Okay, so should she like say, well you can never be, it's weird, right? You couldn't be someone who is in public office and go and also have like a a book reading tour where you read from your novel about crime or something like that. You'd have to be like a no fiction person who's we? When you're talking, you're talking about what you do for work. That's part of what you're talking about. Like, nobody's going to re ask Hillary Clinton to come and speak about the history of jazz in the United States. Right. She's not going to give speeches on that. It's going to give speeches on politics. Right, right, right. So, okay, so why is that okay. Why can you like have two jobs? That means you're having a second job. Like you're doing your job. Like you're, you're saying the things that you say during your job, but somebody else is paying you to, why is it okay that, why is it okay to do that? Like that seems like that's like, that seems like very problematic. Right?

Speaker 4:          01:31:48       Why is it okay for your husband to go talk? Who has he talked to you that the head of the, whoever the prosecutor who was it eats district. His Bill Clinton went and had this secret meeting with what's his, who was it about what? Well, right.

Speaker 5:          01:32:03       Oh, right, right, right. Lindsey, what the Hell is her name?

Speaker 8:          01:32:10       Lost it.

Speaker 4:          01:32:11       Damn it. The point is like, you just are openly like hiring, hiring the, the, the woman who somehow warped the process of getting a Democratic nominee there. Yeah. What's her name? Loretta. Loretta Lynch. Doesn't that sound like a country singer? Is that? Uh, yeah. That's fine. First I was like, yeah, Loretta Lynn, right. That's what it sounds like. Loretta Lynch. Yeah. Now she met Bill Clinton meets with the attorney general on an Arizona Tarmac now. Right.

Speaker 5:          01:32:39       By the way, flew in on his private plane and said that he, it was impromptu who not fuck flat and prompt to on a private.

Speaker 4:          01:32:48       Yeah. Yeah. Hey, you know what? Hey, who are we flying over right now? Wait, are we flying over Loretta Lynch? Oh, come on, stop down and we'll get a piece of apple pie. She's a good wall. And we're going to sit on the porch and drink lemonade. Talk about our grandchildren on the porch, on the tarmac. Nothing I love more than a nice, a nice picnic on the tarmac of an airport.

Speaker 5:          01:33:10       This is the other thing that she lied about being dead broke after leaving the White House. Not only dead broke, but in debt. She said that apparently the system, so not true.

Speaker 4:          01:33:21       Yeah. And now and now it's like t tea to make matters worse. It's like you have to, there's this weird idea that it's like, listen, you might not like Hillary fucking Clinton. Can you go back to that real quick? But they're like, you better shut the fuck up about her because do you want trump to be president? That is what's going on, right? Yeah. So

Speaker 5:          01:33:42       it says here, this is what, this is where it's confusing. It says, when Hillary filed a financial disclosure document after entering the Senate in 2001 she reported assets of less than 1.8 million in liabilities are more than 2 million. Well, where are they doing? What were they doing with all the money? What he's spending money on? There's like, who the fuck? Okay, who has like $2 million in assets and in $2 million in debt? Do you have $2 million in debt? No. Most people don't have $2 million in debt. That's, that's a crazy amount of money. Like, did you guys have a budget? You're dead broke. Now you guys are crazy liquid. He party and you guys do a blow and buying Ferrari's. Just staying on a Amazon later. Who the fuck gets $2 million in the hole like that. That is like, if you want to have someone that you wanted to balance the budget, wouldn't you pick the person that doesn't get 2 million in the hole? I mean, no man, it tried, trump's been bankrupt a gang at times too, right? As he been bankrupt.

Speaker 4:          01:34:41       Yup. That's what they say. He says he likes going bankrupt. It's somehow part of some plan. But now the question, what about the shit about Saudi Arabia? What is this? You don't remember this? I remember when it, it's like Saturday night live was making jokes about them stealing like, uh, like silverware

Speaker 9:          01:34:58       and fine China and stuff from the, when they were like leaving like on their last days there last, oh, that's what year was. This was like two and from 2000, like when they were literally leaving in the bushes were coming in. Oh my God. Taking all sorts of extra artwork and all kinds of things. And I don't know if it's true, but it's, I don't think the meme has gone away.

Speaker 5:          01:35:17       I don't know, man. Ha. That's hilarious. Oh No, no, she's so gangster. Pardon me. Look, look, I, I kind of appreciate it in a way. She's like our Putin. Great, great. Just what we need. We appreciate some gangster, she is, there's a video going around of her talking from 2000 about not having email and then imagine if she had emails like what the investigators would find. Sure. Of course if fine. It's on Mike Pence, his twitter page. Didn't she take money from Saudi Arabia or is that bullshit? Allegedly? I'm not really her accountant so I can't just, I don't know. I just, you know, man, I think it's a, it's like a crazy time right now because we're actually getting to witness that. The, the cool thing about all this shit is nefarious as these assholes want to be there. There they can't keep up with technology.

Speaker 5:          01:36:10       They are being exposed technologically and that's going to continue to happen and that's pretty fucking bad ass man. They get, no matter how powerful or gangster Hillary Clinton is, she has apparently zero security on our computer systems are very little security. And maybe if she had great security, she still couldn't stop the infiltration of a hackers. And this is going to keep happening and happening and happening until either we just accept that our politicians are innately corrupt or we come up with some fucking way to starve them out to make it so that they are. But how, I mean we'll, do you think Bernie was like the first step in that? Like Bernie's no perfect person, right? I'm not the most gigantic Bernie Sanders supporter because of talk to economists that tell me that what he was proposing is not fiscally possible. Yeah. So I don't know if they're right or he's right.

Speaker 5:          01:37:06       And it's all real tricky to me. Like the idea of democratic socialism. Like, boy, it sounds good. It sounds good. If people got more, I'm, I'm warming up to the idea of universal basic income. I kind of liked that idea because I think if you think about how much resources we spend on things like cops and firemen and d damaged on and police and fire, um, uh, rather prisons and how much time maybe we could avoid some of that. Like maybe a big chunk of it. I think universal basic income has like some real, there's got some, it's something that we should explore as a culture, but we, I think also requiring people to do certain things like in the community requiring some sort of community service. Like how nice would it be if a, I mean, it's nice to be able to pay someone to take out the garbage, but maybe we'd appreciate each other more if we all took out the garbage once a month. No Way, man. I disagree with that. That's what they're in Venezuela

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       by the way. They're doing, they're forcing people to be civil, to be farmers for like 60 days out of the year. Something like that. But I make them feel good about farmers know, cause like Venezuela's fucking imploding and they need like Dan but, but um, I'll tell you man, any time the government or federal workers get more power in whatever way it may be, that's a bad thing for all of us. And I think that the, the, the, the more we can push their fucking tendrils out of our consciousness the better. And so anytime anyone is suggesting some new, I don't care how fucking utopian it sounds. Anytime anyone. Here's the thing. Do you think the government is corrupt? If the answer is yes, why would you want to give them more power? What would you want to give them more tax planning. Yeah. Yes. Why?

Speaker 4:          01:38:52       There's no, now when you're talking about taxing people, you're not talking about giving them money directly to the poor people, right? You know? Yeah, man. Talking about going to the government and the government distributes it with no receipt. Right? Man, that's what they do right now. Yeah. We don't want that. That's fucked up. If these people up there, if they were like, somehow we actually just imagine, here's a crazy fantasy. I don't know how you'd implement it, but let's imagine we had a system where every four years, some of the coolest, smartest people in the country became our leaders. Wow. That would be fucking insane. Coolest, smartest people don't want that job just by nature. So it's a strange job. The idea of wanting to be the person that's in control of everything, and I think until it goes horribly wrong, we're going to stay on the outside and we're going to go hug somebody.

Speaker 4:          01:39:41       Come on somebody, come on somebody. I'll tell you, man, I think some of the coolest, smartest people because they're so cool. If I'm just saying, this is a mystery, how to get to them, but let's just say you could. That's a mystery. How you get to them, let's say, and let's imagine there was what? Who are they? You don't even know the name of a person, but gave me the attributes you would want to. I would take somebody like Elon Musk. I would take somebody like you. I would take somebody. Why not? I would take somebody like, I'm so, I don't want the job. What? I don't want to judge you on. Doesn't either. All right, fine, but we all sit together in a room and we're like, hey man, let's imagine like five more fat acids, right? We all sit together in a room and we say, listen, I know none of you guys wanted this fucking job.

Speaker 4:          01:40:27       You're successful because you're super smart and you're super cool and you're having great lives, but would you consider for a couple of years helping us work this shit out so the planet gets a little better and I guaranteed. Now again, this is a fantasy, but I guarantee that there'll be very few people in that room. You'd be like, no, I'm going to live my life. You'd be like, yeah, I'll do it for two years. No problem. How do for four years? Sure. I would love to help and still for four years you go into this job truly thinking, man, I'm going to see if I can reduce the number of people who are fucking uneducated and hungry and the bombs going off and I'm going to try to do it by using all of my smartest friends and I'm not doing it because I'm going to get money from this group or that group.

Speaker 4:          01:41:16       I'm doing it because it feels like the right thing to do. Do you know what that's called, man? That's called the American fucking dream that the founding fathers came up with. That was the idea. We're going to have a group of brilliant, wonderful people who want this particular swath of human beings to be peaceful. What is it? A peaceful place where you can experience life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, right? Freedom, autonomy, community, all of these beautiful things. That was the idea, beautiful idea. It will almost make you cry when you think about how beautiful a fucking idea that is. And then to imagine that that idea over the course of time was gradually deteriorated, gradually infiltrated, gradually broken down. And of course it was because when there is a powerful empire, the empire is inevitably attacked by entities that want to take it over. Of course, it's the nature of things. Something powerful, some asshole wants that power. And so an analysis of the system over the course of time or in an intentional infiltration by people who have all the money or just some systemic degradation, a slow sort of collapse of a million different systems inside the thing has happened that has happened and yet the concept remains one of the most beautiful ideas, one of the most incredible fucking ideas. They cannot erode the concept.

Speaker 5:          01:42:51       Well maybe it can still be saved with technology. Maybe the transparency that's being afforded by technology is going to somehow or another step in and put a halt to what we see as just a standard operational behavior of corruption and influence, corruption and influences. Just so standard that it's right in front of us. When CNN is printing Hillary Clinton's annual earnings for the past two years is $21 million and no one's baton and I, she's sitting there with a bite suit. She has that bite suit on, looks like a fucking German shepherds going to jump out of the bushes and grab her suit. She walks around these boxy bite suit and she's, she's making ungodly sums of money from just talking and she's doing it, doing it, doing it right in front of our face. Yeah, it's, I mean that's one of the beautiful things about Bernie Sanders, one of the most beautiful things he says, I didn't take a dime from those people.

Speaker 5:          01:43:43       I don't speak to the banks because what did you, what did you say when you got paid? Half a million plus or whatever she got paid to speak. How much did she get paid to speak to the banks? Because there was something fucking bananas about that one. There was one of the ones that she got paid. I made, it might've been the 250 million now release. Yeah, there's a bunch you want release. She won't release the ones who she talks to banks, they'll get released, they speak in Latin, they get together. They fucking burn baby snakes. My lyrics virologically I started talking in tongues and ship summary. [inaudible] they're all eyes wide. Shut it out. Yeah. Hoods on and fucking candle light pentagrams everywhere. Yeah, man, you, they pro I wouldn't be fucking surprised if there's a few things they do that we might consider to be a little abnormal when they get together.

Speaker 5:          01:44:26       Bohemian Grove, look, Bohemian Grove, whatever the fuck they're doing, their whatever they they do it for, for whatever reason they really do. Or at least used to dress up in robes and burn an effigy in front of a fucking giant owl statue. Okay. There's a video of it. It's real for them. They say it's fun and it's just like a, uh, one of those frat pranks or traditions that people do, although dress up in weird costumes and they go through some weird skull and bones ceremony that their grand pappy did and everybody does it. Cause you want to be, what does that, what is it called? Pledged. You want to be pledged? Initiated. Initiated. Yeah. I mean, come on man. This is, there's a real video of these fucking multimillionaire guys meeting in Bohemian Grove and burning these fit. Look at that. Hillary Clinton was paid $225,000 to speak at Goldman Sachs builders and innovators, conference builders and innovative at the Ritz Carlton Dove Mountain Resort and Marina, Arizona.

Speaker 5:          01:45:25       That is a Golfer's paradise. All those rich dudes out there golfing drive in those convertible Mercedes is with the metal tops close and open and like 13 seconds. Yeah. These, these guys are, look, they're all fucking monsters. You know, man, I, I'll tell you, this is something that I was thinking, and by the way, I'm sorry, I did a fucking seemingly patriotic spiel. I didn't know that was inside of it. It's, well, it is patriotic, but it's, it's you. You are right. These people were massively repressed by Europe. They took this incredible chance of getting in boats and coming across an ocean in the time where we're navigating things with something that looks like a protractor. I mean the, the, he had sextants and other staring at the fucking constellations trying to figure out which way to go. They're manipulating the air and get there.

Speaker 5:          01:46:14       It's fucking amazing. And a lot of them are doing that because they want to worship God in a certain way that they're not able to show you where they're coming from. But even even whatever their rationale for leaving, they still had the balls to get on a fucking boat and make cross the ocean. So that puts them in a better place in my eyes. Then those pussies that stayed back and believed in logic but lived under the rule of the queen. Yeah, those dummies are the king. Was it came back then? Probably probably a kings. But my point is I don't have a point, but if I had a point, what would it would be? That's the reason why America is so fucking bad ass that at least at least the

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       of the initial instincts to start it still exist. Yeah. The idea can't go away. It's a, it's like a geometric form. It, here's the problem man. Okay, this is why it's thinking. So let's imagine that you and I are somehow, I don't know why we end up on a cruise ship filled with idiots like literal fucking idiots fricking happen. Somehow they just like, they went through like maybe like some, it's like the opposite of a reality show where you find a great person like over the course of like months, they find like the world's worst people, right? And so are the world's like maybe like the world's most unwise people are the world's dumbest people. So you end up in with like a population of like 60 idiots on the boat. And I'm not saying we're not idiots. I certainly don't consider myself to be a MENSA member, but, but let's imagine we're a little like more on the ball and these guys are right, the boat fucking racks.

Speaker 4:          01:47:46       We're on an island now we have to build a civilization. How does democracy become a good thing if the majority of people are kind of not that fucking on point, right? What happens if, um, what if it's a, let's imagine it's a boat filled with psychotics. Let's imagine it's a boat filled with people who are paranoid schizophrenia for example. How do you have a democracy of paranoid schizophrenia, six running things. And so when you have the news spraying out a paradigm that is also weirdly corrupt in the sense that the news is being run by a groups of people who want to sell advertising and need to be entertaining. And you know, they have to at least present this information and it kind of entertaining, possibly warped way. There are cases including in the recent wikileaks, uh, dump that, where the, uh, where they were the, in the, what's it called, the ndd that in the nondisclosure agreement with the national, the Democratic Group, the DNC, the DNC was telling, giving like talking points to the press, right?

Speaker 4:          01:48:51       So if the media is painting a picture of the universe that is not accurate or is warped a little bit based on consumerism or the corporations that are running things, then the people who have tuned into that reality and believe it to be true, you could safely say they are mildly psychotic because they have bought into a reality tunnel that might not actually exist. In which case is a democracy at that point. A good thing. If the people living in the democracy have for a lifetime, been getting bad information, shot into their fucking brains, marijuana, I'll give you brain damage wars. Good. Sometimes you just need to fucking kill people. We have got to get into fucking Iraq because Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction that he is going to UN leash on the fucking West. Wrong information. But if you believe it, you believe wrong information, and if you believe wrong information, then that means that you are no longer walking along the path that is there, but a path created by other people.

Speaker 4:          01:49:58       Right? So that's when democracy gets really interesting because now what we have is very powerful hypnotic cobbles of con, of, of, of billionaires sending bad information to the population and attempt to shift their perceptual mechanisms in such a way that they will elect leaders that don't represent them, but that have been created by these machines to take over the world. And in that case, the democracy becomes a little bit more problematic. So that's another problem. It's like, okay, great. Now let's imagine we suddenly have a functioning democracy. What if a lot of people in that function functioning democracy have subscribed to ideas that don't, that aren't real, and that they're not willing to let go of? Are you writing down? Never put, Duncan is showing you. You'll know how to remember something. I keep forgetting and I have to remember it. You just, I don't want to stop your rant. Oh, cool. Just, you know when you're high as fuck like we are right now so great and we start talking about stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:51:01       When you're talking, I have an idea but it just, I have to follow your idea and my idea slips away. I had to write it down.

Speaker 4:          01:51:06       It's just that the idea is what if this, what if not many of us like the shit we believe ain't real and what if that shit that we think is real has been intentionally placed into our heads by corporations with the intention of making us behave in a certain way. At that point a democracy becomes problematic. Like what are you going to do if you mean there's so many people right now who believe the like trump is putting out a reality tunnel. Hillary Clinton's putting out a reality tunnel. These are two different reality tunnels where many of the pieces of it might not actually reflect what's happening in the world. So it's like, which of these made up stories are you going to tune into or are you going to reject both of them and go wandering off into the woods alone and try to, in your own way, understand what's happening minus the influence of the corporate media.

Speaker 5:          01:51:59       I was thinking when we're talking about people coming over in boats that we were talking earlier about the human biome and uh, your, your gut biome in particular, it affects your mood, your intelligence level, your personality, it affects your immune system. And that is, that's one thing that I've been really getting into over the last few years is really concentrating on probiotics first. Kombucha, that was the big one. I liked that. A gts Kombucha. I like that original flavor. It's like a, it's almost like, it feels like someone blew their nose in it. Those slimy slugs, those, those, uh, Combu just slugs. You gotta throw it down, but it's really good for your immune system. And it made a big difference with all my travel on the road. But then I started really getting into, Kiefer, started really getting into a, I drink goat's milk keifer several times a week and I drink whole glass of it and man, it, I, the more I have been constantly on that Kimchi.

Speaker 5:          01:52:50       That's another one that I've really gotten into lately. Um, fermented cabbage. Um, it's a, it's really good for you, very probiotic as well. The more I'm doing this, like I feel happier, if that makes any sense. It actually makes me feel better. Yeah. I don't just feel like healthier in terms of my immune system's really good, but I feel better. So what I was thinking is these poor folks that got on that boat and came across the seas. When you think about the horrible atrocities committed by the pilgrims or the Columbus, his soldiers, yes. When they came over here, I mean, they buy one account of a missionary. They were dashing babies' heads on rocks and were cutting people's arms off. They didn't bring back their weight in gold. Right. There was some really dark, dark, dark shit going on. I wonder if it was a combination of obviously barbaric human beings in barbaric times when things were just way fucking different and it was very little accountability for psychopathic behavior and in fact you hired these fucking psychopaths, these abused people, murders.

Speaker 5:          01:53:52       There's, there's are your soldiers cause your people, you're hiring, you know, those are the people that you put on that fucking boat. Those are the only people that are willing so they get across his ocean. It takes months. Right. How long did it take? Get across seat, find that out. I'm going to say three months. Do you think it took three months? I don't know. I'm going to say it took like 90 days. I would think longer than that. Really, man. Probably right. Maybe four months. What do you think? Four months? I don't know. Like I feel like three months to do it. If you knew what you were doing,

Speaker 10:         01:54:18       you got to get the right wins. I mean it's like,

Speaker 5:          01:54:21       well you definitely might not make it. And I like it says approximately two months, two months quick. It started in early August and got there October 12th wow. God. That's so ballsy. Took approximately two months. Christopher Columbus started his voyage in Palos Spain in early August of 1492 with three ships, the Nina, the Pinta, Santa Maria. We all know that stuff. Wow. That's amazing. Q madge and just being on that boat, being a fucking fly on the wall on that boat, watching those murderers sail across the ocean and knowing one day you're going to get a day off school for those cunts.

Speaker 10:         01:54:55       No Shit. We think of that. There's these showed up, but they just raped and murdered everybody. We get a day off school for him. Pray, pray, praying along the way.

Speaker 5:          01:55:04       Long weekend, we're going to have a suit coming. Whoo.

Speaker 10:         01:55:08       Again. There you go. Yeah. The fucking information that we have does not accurately reflect reality. Right. We have been conditioned intentionally by a power structure to believe in a reality tunnel that if you don't believe in that reality tunnel, you're considered to be somebody who's a little crazy. Yeah, your fucking mind. Columbus was a good man. What are you fucking talking about?

Speaker 5:          01:55:33       I remember that commercial where the guy's eating salad and his friends going, what do you mean if I buy drugs? You sports. How? Terrorism, right. Fact, right that he's eating salad. He's a no nonsense kind of steak bar. Remember that? Because it's a fact. I say it because of the fact that's it. The Guy Guy's like standing there like it's that relationship that we all know of that one fucking super good arguing, right wing guy that's a little bit older and the other guy and he kind of clowns them when they have lunch together. Come on, get your shit together Mike. Okay, we're going to make the loan go through but straighten out your credit. That's the same guy because you're supporting terrorism is the fact is eating a salad or say cause it's fact. Yet there's something cycle. Just like a mind fuck going on.

Speaker 5:          01:56:12       Cause we know that relationship. We know that paradigm which wean the really fucking straight up Republican, no nonsense. Got His shit together, has a cigar and a single malt scotch. And that's about it. And we know and that other guy who's like, Hey, I heard that tower seven is a, is an inside job. What? Yeah, don't say that eating is lettuce or tell him fuck. It's not true. It's not true because it's a fact. You can, I know without saying it's a bad example, but that thing that people like to do, it's a fat little fuck man. I mean yeah that it's a fact fucking guy is our version of a person who has been, it happens in North Korea. There's that like, I don't know if you saw it but like in one of these documentaries about North Korea, which I love to watch cause it's the ultimate example.

Speaker 5:          01:56:57       If a hypnotize culture when you submit ultimate and it's right now right now, which is insane when you consider what the past could have been like. We never, we don't have a window. We don't have a window into what gingiss Khan's empire was like. We don't have a window to Mao's China. We don't have a window to that, but we have a window right now. A fucking physical window of real video. This is it. This is the guy does a no nonsense guy play the commercial. I love this crash will go from the beginning to it from the beginning. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:57:24       These bells, it drug money, funds, terror. It's a ploy. Manipulation. Got Jamie. Why should I believe that? New to the Internet,

Speaker 5:          01:57:36       he's got several tabs going at the same time. You're going to hear him moaning soon because he's got his porn.

Speaker 11:         01:57:41       It's a ploy. It's drug money, funds, terror. It's deploying Laurie manipulation like he's eating drug money, ploys, terror. I mean why should I believe that? Because it's a fat, fat, fat. So you're saying that I shouldn't believe it because it's true. That's, that's your argument. It is true.

Speaker 5:          01:58:07       This is the dumbest fucking conversation. Cause I want to jump in there and I say, okay, well tell me how that's true. Let me give me some specifics. I talk to you about money funds to her. Can I tell you it's true? If you're, yeah, you're the guy. I'm the other guy. Here's how it's true. Okay. So, um, many of the people who are currently in the u s government have taken lots of money from the pharmaceutical companies that supply some of the most dangerous drugs on earth to people all over the planet. And, and, and those people in the government are also in charge of dropping bombs on people in other parts of the world. Stop you right there. They also made Viagara and the pill. That's great. Okay. That was great. Oh, choose Viagara don't you like the pill? Drugs? Don't you like to shoot loads and you grow without any consequences?

Speaker 5:          01:58:57       Yes, I know. We all do have, that's funding terrorism. Every time you shoot a load into your girl, that's fun. Are you sure? Is it a fact? Is it an fmct fat dude? Terrorism? Fuck. I'll tell you. Fucking terrorism. Terrorism is every time. I mean, when you start hearing the civilian casualties in Syria and all over the fucking place, show you something. I'm going to show you something. Go back a few days on my, um, my twitter feed. I retweeted this Syrian girl who was a praying, oh, I saw it. I saw her. Safety. You've seen it. Right. Again, if you want to horrify the fucking audience, but I'd rather not watch it again. Okay, well let's just describe what it is. Um, you could, you can go watch yourself. Forget it Jamie. He's gonna Freak out. I was ready to cry. I'm ready to cry. It's horrible.

Speaker 5:          01:59:43       There's a guy and he's talking to his daughter and she's reciting a prayer and apparently she's reciting some prayer of safety and while they're doing it, you here and they both get shot like rocketed back and forth. Like something hit near their building. You see like the reverberations, the impact move them. They, they jut out of the frame and then the video stops. It's terrifying. I mean, look, it might not even be real. I'm, I'm assuming it's real. I'm assuming it's real. It might not even be real, but it, cause I don't know, I can't verify it. But that happens exactly the way you're looking at it. Whether or not that is an actual representation or whether or not somebody wants you to imagine what it would be like. I don't know. I don't know the veracity. I haven't, I haven't studied the video. I don't know.

Speaker 5:          02:00:33       Have you, do you know whether or not anybody's calling bullshit on that video? Well, look, I mean it's, yeah, they do bond. Exactly. But I'm not sure if you're seeing that or if it's one of the, you know, there's a, there's a company that was a, I think it's an Australia that uh, they create fake viral videos to get hits and they're a special effects company and they've, they're responsible for like a gang of amazing videos that have been online. One of them was this, a couple that shot a lion and then you, you see the lion, uh, another line there. They're standing over taking pictures. Yeah. This one special effects group made that and a bunch of other fake ones too, that a lot of people sent me and they said they were real and I retweeted them like, oh wow, that's crazy. You know, but meanwhile these people are just special effects artists.

Speaker 5:          02:01:16       Cool. The line one didn't get me, I was like, this is too perfectly framed. It's too good. It got me, didn't get me at all. Plus, I didn't like the way that the line, the way it was looking though. It was sitting there on the ground. It looked fake. The whole thing looked like it looked like a fake lie. But then there's one that came out today that I'm a reasonably sure is real. And this one I was telling you about before the show, but there's a bear in this guy's house and uh, he looks downstairs in my friend Shane Carwyn actually tweeted a picture. I've got a retweet it when I find it. He tweeted me a picture today of a fucking bear that broke into his friend's cabin and tore it apart. Tore the, uh, the frigerator open, ripped out everything on the floor, ripped out cabinets, just tore his fucking place bar.

Speaker 5:          02:01:58       And apparently his friend called Shane is like, ah, hey dude, did you uh, use my cabin or something? Cause I know Shane Collins is giant heavyweight UFC fighter. He's a former, uh, UFC interim heavyweight champion. He's a gorilla. And so his friend, like that's the first person he called. Imagine if someone tears through your house, Richard Fucker, refrigerated door off the wall, this foot plate waste like they eat someone just fucking hulked out in your kitchen. So they call Shane up for is hey dude, um, my cabin rip my refrigerator door off. And then there was another one. That's true as well. It's real where a bear got trapped in someone's car, somehow know that the bear opened the car door, which they've been known to do. If you leave it open, look at that. That's a bear trap in the back of that fucking Subaru poor guy.

Speaker 5:          02:02:44       I wonder how long and he's in there for, it's a good question. I think they were walking by and they found them. So what a bear does is they know, they figured out over time that they can open car doors. If they open up a car door, they watch someone open up a car door, I'll get another bear. And then there's food in there. That's it from then on there opening car doors. So while when I was in boulder, one of the people that lived in the town over from where I lived, got their car broken into and the bear ate the inside of their car. The bear, I mean literally ate their seats. Eight, their dashboard, Dan, the crazy sucks. So this bear is trapped in this guy's car. This is 100% legit. So you opens up the car door with his paws, climbs inside. And you know, like if a car is like at a kind of an angle, the door will close itself. Door closes itself. He's like, Whoa, just stuck in his car. Just mangling it. Look at it, look at the chair, torn apart. Probably shitting all over the dashboard.

Speaker 3:          02:03:44       I'm good. I'm right here. I wonder if their insurance coverage, I wonder if anybody's got a bow and Arrow coming to make some bare sausage son. Uh, you gotta let him out. I means that's fucked up. Shoot an animal inside a car. That's not fair. Chase. I'm joking around. Ladies and gentlemen. I would definitely let them out, but I'd be fucking pissed because this car is just shot. It's mangled. You can open up your trunk with a, uh, a key and with some people does that, what they did, did they open up the bag and let him out? What's happening here? How can the hatches open areas just ran off and he's running off. That was a pretty decent sized bear yet. What kind of damage did it do? Pretty peaceful man. Bears always seem like they run, they tend to run for sure. Right? Until they kill you. Yeah. You say, oh, it's peaceful. It's peaceful. Do you know more people get killed by black bears then by grizzlies? No. Did Not. It's

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       weird. Grizzlies a lot of times the key by accident like a, you stumble upon the mom and the cubs, right? Black bears apparently will actively seek people sometimes when they're really desperate. Oh my God, man. That is, fuck. There's a bear. My neighbor had suppose how's the past dean of bears are eating garbage and stuff or having a good old time and swimming pools and shit. You don't have to worry about them. You got to worry about, um, predatory bear. It's like there's a guy that I know steve or Hosa show meter. One of his friends took a guy out hunting for his very first time they were camping and a 500 pound predatory black bear climb. The 10 attacked him in the middle of the night and his friends shot the bear. The bullet went through the bear and shot his friend in the wrist so he got shot.

Speaker 5:          02:05:20       He got bit by a bear is first hunting trips cause arrest. Bullet shattered his wrist, went through the baron shatters wrist. That's tough man. Whenever you have those kinds of bad lucks land on top of each other, like the balloon accident where like not only do you fall to your death, but you're also on fire while you fall to your death. 17 people. Terrible fuck hot air balloons, dude. Fuck, fuck. Being in the sky with fire and cloth. Never. What about a hard breeze? What happens if this bitch gets hit by lightning? Huh? You ever fucking monkeys? I watched the video. That guy jumping out of the plane. Yes. Yes, I did. Insane. 10th insane. Insane. And by the way, he didn't even hit it in the middle. He hit the edge. I mean, I'm sure it's a huge fucking net, but not huge enough.

Speaker 5:          02:06:06       Like how you judging that correctly when you're coming down at who knows how fast he's coming down. He lays there for a second until like he's stunned or sad. A flip over before impact. She was practicing flipping over like he had otherwise his face is going to get shredded, right? He's got to land on his back. So this guy's going down and then right before he hits the bottom, he flips. So he's got to like guide himself with his own fucking arms and he hosted, he doesn't splatter. That's his gopro man. I mean, how is he possibly going to judge this? I mean, he has some sort of a, a like a wingspan thing going on, whereas his legs are spread. Now Watch this, she falls over, he turns over right before the end and, and lands in the net. What in the actual fuck. And everybody's applauding.

Speaker 12:         02:06:56       It's Bobby Collins and Whoopi Goldberg. They're, they're, they're both selling. Hey, almost doug. He's,

Speaker 5:          02:07:05       he's, he's, he's crying. Oh dude, it mom, this girl's got big tits. Come here. Take a look at these teds before. Hey, this guy will get his deck. Why they have these people? Look at this. We are here live on the scene. He didn't die. It's amazing. This is the first time ever a person did this and lived. We're so happy. We're so happy we could broadcast this on television. It's so important. Look at, yes

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       we do, dude. We did it. You crazy fuckers. All of you. Oh my God. Cause you know if that shit didn't work out, oh my God, the net broke and for the rest of your life, you have to remember that the what that looks like a just the explosion Godson, the, that sound that's going to make, when that thing hits the fucking tarmac, his wife's screaming or just a silent scream. Just everyone. Just Ptsd. You're going to have to go to a therapist to get that out of your head. You're going to wake up with the memory of that guy's body just exploding like a fucking watermelon in front of you. What if the pressure of the situation, the gravity of the situation, the, the adrenaline rush and the g force all combined made him stroke out like that Indian dude and he just never even bothered steering and went right into the crowd.

Speaker 2:          02:08:29       Oh Man. Like a human messel just took out kids and fucking grandma crushed a subaru scraps of bloody gatorade color jumpsuit landing on your kid. Imagine if you died because this guy hit the ground and his skull went flying through the air and hit you in the face and crush your head. You got your head crushed from his forehead. Or even worse, you don't die. You just get like amputated. No, you just have like neurological problems for the rest of your life. Like you like, you know, like someone is in a car accident and you go into a temporary when he come out you, you shit yourself for the rest of your life and people ask why? It's like a skydiver skull smashed into me. Terrible man. Fuck Dude. High impact. Avoid that. What high impact? High impact. Avoid that. Don't jump out of those planes into nuts.

Speaker 2:          02:09:24       Stop. Are they going to get fucking cte from net falling? Imagine if that becomes a new thing. What's what kind of cte, chronic traumatic, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and stuff. So brain damaged the football players get, I would imagine the jolt of going from space into a fucking net is considerable. Yeah, sure. Yeah, I would imagine that that has an impact on your fucking don't easy on your fucking body to fall out of a plane in anything. It's definitely not what you, by the way, man. Speaking of like fucked up like sports accidents and I know you get sick of talking about the UFC, but dude, that fucking clip of, what's his name? Cyborg. What's the guy's name? The guy that when I bought Santos is a bunch of cyborgs. There's a two male cyborgs and one female, so it makes sense. It's a cool word, but I was thinking man, that thing he did the knee kick flying knee kick smashed. The guys handled. Ever say knee kick. Don't ever say, what'd he say? It's a knee flying knee. You don't see a knee kick. Guys, listen to my voice. Do I sound like I know a lot about the USC, a little Moitai back in the, well, my

Speaker 4:          02:10:34       trainer taught me some. But anyway, the point is, is it possible, you know, k basketball people are getting better at basketball, right? Skateboarding people are getting better at skateboarding. Is it possible that in the UFC people are going to become so proficient at beating each other up that it, there will be more of this type of awful accident happening where people just learn how to be powerful enough to crush a person's skull where you just get better at it, man. Like if you look at like, and it's not a fair comparison because this Pa skateboard you, it requires a tool. But if you look at like early skateboarding videos to now and see how much it's evolved and you know, the UFC has the market pressure for these fighters to be the best ever because they become like world renowned fighters and they make a lot of money. So the pressure is there to evolve. If you look at UFC 100 years from now, isn't it possible that fighters are going to get so good that it is no longer safe to do the UFC because they're just going to be strong enough to break someone's skull open with their fucking fists or with their knees?

Speaker 5:          02:11:48       Well, let me answer that. First of all, it was a very unusual scenario where a guy was diving forward and the other guy was jumping forward with the name and they combined in a perfect collision. Right. It's very unusual to happen that way. It's happened before though. Um, it, it does happen. It can happen. But that was the most extreme version of ever seen in my life. And all my years of watching martial arts, watching martial arts training and martial arts, seeing fights, I don't know how many fights I've seen live, but it's gotta be more than a thousand. It's probably what, sure. It's probably like 1500 or something like that live. I've never seen it once. I only watched it once on TV. So, um, guys have definitely gotten their nose broken though. And they've definitely gotten their orbits broken. The orbit broken, orbital, orbital a bone is super common.

Speaker 5:          02:12:37       That's real common. That happens all the time. That happens like once a year. I mean in the, in that sense of calm and more, maybe even more than that. We don't hear about it. Maybe they're small fractures, but like Misha tate, the former women's bantamweight champion, she got her orbital bone broken in a fight. Um, Bob psats ha. He had Bob Sapp had his orbital bone broken in by cro cop. Uh, I can name a bunch of them were guys who have gotten their orbital broken. It's really common. So, uh, that's your face. You're getting your face broke. It, this is just a different version of it. And it was such an extreme impact. Michael Venom page, the guy who did it is a, a sport karate champion and a really dynamic guy. He's so fucking fast and his technique is so good. His timing is so good.

Speaker 5:          02:13:18       He's a lifelong martial artists who was competing as a point karate guy. And then he went from being a point karate guy to fighting and mma and he can hit guys in this crazy way, dives in and hits them and they can't him back. And when they were running at him, he counters them brilliantly. And that's what he did in this fight. Cyborg who's talented guy who has been around a long time, he's really experienced, he's fought in strikeforce. He fought in the UFC and the UFC. I feel like he did. I'm almost positive he did. Um, Google that though please. Cause I know he fought in strikeforce. He had an epic fight with Nick Diaz and strike force and Jordan Meehan and strike force epic epic fights. So he's a real veteran. And uh, to have this happen to him is even more impressive. It just shows you how good this page kid is.

Speaker 5:          02:14:02       But um, it's so unusual the way it happened. I've never seen it like that before where a guy just charged in and the other guy didn't hit, just hit him with the need put jumped at him. So you'd have to have Michael Venom pages, athleticism, technique, experience, lifelong martial artist. Perfect timing. And then also fight intelligence. Like he had the intelligence to choose that weapon. He has a full arsenal of techniques. He knew that that would be the most effective blow to land in that moment. So all his lifelong experience of competing as a martial artist led to that moment. So it was a perfect storm for cyborgs head. The wrong the wrong thing at the wrong time. And it can always happen just like Dale earnhardt junior or senior died in a car accident. It can happen like the, the, even the great ones can get really badly hurt.

Speaker 5:          02:14:51       But, but you could see it like, I mean, I'm sure you've seen it over those 1500 fights you've seen having, you seen an evolution in the fighting styles, but on both sides. The other thing is I've seen an evolution in people's defense too, but there's guys like mighty mouse who like barely get hit, right. You know, and he, and he's beating guys up, but occasionally you'll get a guy who is like an elite guy and another guy is an elite guy and always cancel each other out. People get mad, people get mad because it's not an of action cause they're both two smart and they kind of like canceling each other. That does happen. That happens in fights. So I just think that everybody is definitely getting better, but their defense is getting better as well. And it's just, it's a sport where it's so chaotic and anyone can win by knockout if they connect and everyone is so fast and everyone has so much technique that the best guys can knock out the best guys.

Speaker 5:          02:15:42       We saw it this weekend. Matt Brown, who is like one of the top UFC welterweight in the world, he's a fucking animal savage. One of my favorite fighters ever fought this kid named Jake ellenberger. Yeah. Jake ellenberger is a very talented guys, had ups and downs, but he's lost a bunch of fights recently to top level guys. And this was his last chance in the UFC. They gave him a last chance. They said, you know, they were gonna cut him and he said, just give me one more fight. And they said, okay, we're going to give you matt Brown who's a demon. And he's like, okay. So he went in and knocked out Matt Brown the first round, but it was crazy. It was a crazy chaos filled fight. He blasted him with a right hand and kicked him the body with a liver kick and put them away.

Speaker 5:          02:16:22       It was an madness fight. And even Matt Brown was even coming back after getting hit with the first big punch. But my point is, on any given night, one of these guys connect and they can knock out the other guy. They can both do it. Matt Brown easily could've knocked out ellenberger right? Easily could have connected sales. It's, it's possible for all these guys to knock each other out. So it's a nutty sport man. So they're definitely getting better at it, but they're all getting better. So it's harder to hit him clean and they're better at delivering shots. Well, if one person gets better, then everyone's going to adapt to come up with some defense for whatever. The thing is. That person's gotten better at, I guess. But he did learn the techniques, they learn the techniques and they understand when the, when they're coming. But if you had to predict, like if someone's, like, if you had to predict five years from now, what kind of, if you've seen a kind of evolution in that fighting styles, then you've, you've seen an something that maybe you can prognosticate in five years, what do you, what do you think it's going to look like?

Speaker 5:          02:17:26       How will it be different? How will the UFC change over time if mixed martial arts is an evolving sport? Well, we already know pretty much I would say there's always room for new stuff. It's always possible the new stuff comes out. But I would comfortably say we know at least 95% of all the striking options were pretty, pretty well versed in what a person can do with their bones. And I'm being real conservative. When I say 95% is probably closer to 99% but every now and then someone will do something crazy. Like this guy, uh, I don't know the name of the organization, but just knock some guy out with an ax kick the other day. And somebody sent it to me and I was like, Ooh, see if he could find that ax kick Kayo and mma. It's real recent. This is the first time I've seen that in a televised MMA bow.

Speaker 5:          02:18:11       But I saw it a gang and times and taekwondo tournament. And I, I, I've witnessed it firsthand with a very good friend of mine. He got knocked out horribly by an ax kick. So I know that accidents are real dangerous for guys good at them, but you have to have elite flexibility and speed and you have to know how to land it. And, uh, so that was a new one that up until this year, I don't think anybody knocked anybody out with one before. There was a guy named Adlon Ama golf who was fighting in strikeforce and he fought in the UFC for a little bit, but he got real religious and he decided to, to quit fighting. But I think he might've fuck somebody up with an ax kick wants he had, he had nasty, nasty kicks. But the point is that might've been the last of the Mohicans as far as like new techniques that you're going to see people do.

Speaker 5:          02:18:53       Pretty much everything. Round kicks, sidekicks, front kicks, we already seen all those. We already know they exist. So that's pretty much covered. But it's really getting, what people are getting better at is their ability to deliver those techniques in a fluid form that's imperceptive both for the person's trying to anticipate the movements. So like when someone is attacking you, what it's like is say if you were a really dumb guy and you were in a debate about Chris with Christopher hitchens about something that you really shouldn't have been debating for about, like you don't really don't know the subject very well when you're talking shit. And he just starts with

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       is he's clinking his whiskey glass around and touching it with his fingers and just demolish his you on on real time with Bill Maher. Right? Yeah. You know what I mean? Mean, like Christopher hitchens could do to any of it.

Speaker 4:          02:19:38       So fun to watch him do that. Too.

Speaker 3:          02:19:40       Terrifying because you would think, oh my God, what if it was me? What if I got up there and talk about the Iraq war? I, you know what the fuck I'm talking about me. He is buried me. Did you ever see when he buried most def? No, he hurried them. Most def was asking questions about al Qaeda and the Taliban. He didn't know the different in al Qaeda and the Taliban. I don't either. And uh, most def, um, was talking about it and Christopher Hitchens to society was annoying and just does distressed him. Just undressed him. Absolutely trust him downs at the word. How's like depression.

Speaker 4:          02:20:12       I would almost rather get dragged off by a tiger and have hitchins destroy me. Fuck him, Bill. You're so ruthless about become a monk. If that happened, I'd be like, well, I'm just going away. I'm going to find a little monastery and just shave my head and say goodbye to the universe.

Speaker 3:          02:20:30       Like there's some guys, they can destroy you, but you almost feel like a, they're letting you off the hook. Like Sam Harris. Sam Harris destroys people in a very calm way and he doesn't insult them. Right. But he does it very logically be lets you know that he thinks you're retarded. Right. He wouldn't use those words, but I do, but, but hitchins shows utter disdain for you while he's scoring on it.

Speaker 4:          02:20:53       Harris seems like there's that hope when, yeah, when, yeah, Hitchens is pissed. Harris, it feels more like, at least there's the hope that he's going to bring you to his side. There's something compassionate in it, but yeah. Hitchins is like, yeah, hitchens is like, well, you just, I might as well, you can be part of the genocide that I want to have happen to idiots of the world. And it's a really a really intense thing to watch, man. He must, he must've just constantly read. Like that guy must've just woken up in the morning and just started reading for hours. And it was definitely, yes,

Speaker 3:          02:21:30       definitely not just smart, but also well-read. Yeah. We all, we all know people that are very smart, but they don't read that much. Right. He was all the above smart, well read and did a lot of debating and had a lot of conversations with really smart people, which is a big part of it as well. And you know, and we're very lucky that we get to listen to those because that's kind of like having those conversations, not in the sense that you're saying the words, but being privy to a conversation with a guy like Hitchens, like you see sitting there and talking with Sam Harris or some a religious leader or something like that in the, the logical points that he makes, it's, they're, they're, they're very enriching in a way that a lot of times, like school isn't even, a lot of times your professor is a fucking incompetent cunt that got that job because he sucked the right decks and now he's got tenure.

Speaker 4:          02:22:15       Yeah. There's a lot of those shitty repressors man. Yeah. Yeah. Did a lot of those, there's a hitchens video. Did you see the one where he talks about what a monster Saddam Hussein wise and you see now and oh yeah, his genius. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          02:22:27       and he's right. You know, I, it was all my arm monster though. Saddam Hussein, he was our monster. Sure. Yeah. We, we helped that guy, but his sons are even scarier. They ever read some of the things that his sons did. I can't remember. I, his sons were like Ramsay Bolton from the game of thrones. But for real, they fed women to dogs. They would take a woman, they would take her from her bridal party, raper killer husband or throw her husband in jail raper and then feed her to their dogs. And they did this more than once. God Damn, man. Yeah. Well this is what we're talking about. We were talking about like North Korea, by the way. I don't know that this happened. I wasn't there. This is what I heard and this is what he could read it online. That's what everybody has said. It's pretty much agreed that he did it. But I think again, like I was criticizing you earlier, I totally could be completely wrong, but this guy, if they did do it, I'm pretty sure they did or something like it. They didn't do awesome stuff. That was not that long ago, man.

Speaker 4:          02:23:27       We did some awesome stuff. You know, like I bet it wasn't all feed and girls.

Speaker 5:          02:23:33       The dog was, I bet they were complete total sociopaths and psychopaths from the womb there. Dad was a murderer is dictator. He raised them and I bet he raised them to be fucking monsters. No, you're ready to romance book. Who did, how many sane jerk off to it?

Speaker 4:          02:23:48       I haven't read it yet. I think they're releasing it soon. Look at it and shit like there. He wrote like a real, a romantic piece of fiction. I mean, by the way, I'm not saying that Hussein or bolt or whatever the fuck is weird day Coosa Uday and Qusay work. But it is so fucking terrible when you realize that even the worst people still have something good about them did. They're isn't a complete monster out there. Well, there's definitely complete monsters. So happened for sure. I think that inside you don't think Ed gain, the guy used to make lampshades at a women's skin do serial killer. I think the monster is part of being human being is that no matter how fucking awful you are and no matter how terrible, now this could be completely naive and I'm sure there's exceptions, but mostly no matter how fucking off who you are, some little piece of you inside of you glimmering way down there underneath all the fucking violence and murder knows that you have the potential to be kind and it tortures you and I think that's inside every single person. You can feel it in you all the time, no matter how good or how bad you are. There's always that like you want to help. There's always something in there. Even fucking Dahmer, even the worst of the worst man, somewhere in there. There it's in. It's in every single person. It's what I think it's what we are. And the more separate you get from it,

Speaker 2:          02:25:24       the more you start doing, you know, he would get, it starts with like not putting your fucking shopping cart away at the grocery store. The problem was we're talking about people that aren't broken. They're there. There's people that through whatever reason, through nature or nurture, there's people that have fuses broken. Just like there's people that are born with leukemia, just like some people have cancer, just like some people have epilepsy, just like some people are born with disfigured arms. Some people's brains are fucking wired wrong from the jump. There's something wrong biologically with them. Okay, sure. Right. I mean, don't, wouldn't we assume? Yes, I would. I totally agree that there are people, he's fucking, brains aren't working, but I don't think we're just our brains. No, I mean, I don't think so either, but I, well that's what I'm saying. Like it's not an either or.

Speaker 2:          02:26:06       It's not a nature or nurture. It's probably all kinds of stuff going on, you know? I mean, I think some people are most likely born with defective minds. Right? We all agree with that. There was definitely people that have uh, challenged, uh, learning disabilities, all sorts of issues and a dyslexia. There's all sort of things that were absolutely aware of. Well there's got to be for sure some shit that would lead a person to not understand when they're causing other people harm or not care or, or like it, this is what I mean, is it sociopath? Right? See, I like to believe that because okay. And this is, you know, an infinite never ending argument. Some people believe humans are meat robots. Self awareness comes from the sum total of all these different processes running at once. And now we have this awareness of this south, whatever that may be.

Speaker 2:          02:26:58       Some people think that there is an infinite never ending undying pixel that is grow that a human has grown around [inaudible] and I think goes on forever. And that thing is I'm made of love or for lack of a better word, it is. Um, right. So the idea is, and I, I like to believe this idea, as crazy as it may sound, anyone can be redeemed. Redemption is possible for all humans living today. There is a way to stop your forward momentum and the direction of selfishness and start moving in the direction of being a little bit less of a fucking prick. I believe maybe people that have the inclination or they have the potential to be a psychopath if they were raised by kind and loving people would develop patterns of behavior that are consistent with civilization and with harmony and community. Like maybe what you get when you get a psychopath is the combination of really shitty upbringing, child abuse, all sorts of awful verbal and emotional shit that happens. People in physical shit that happens to people in the young and these traits. Yeah, and also maybe maybe some of those traits are triggered by genes expressing themselves and time of great duress. Yeah, which is one of the things that I was talking about that I forgot earlier. I started on it, but I never finished. It was talking about the

Speaker 5:          02:28:21       people that came over on these boats. They're their gut biome. If we're talking about someone who is on a boat for 60 days eating fucking beef jerky and they come over here with scurvy, they're desperate. They're fucking body's eating itself. I mean, literally their body's eating itself. Yeah, you're, you're, your bones are fucking weak. Your lack of vitamin C is causing you to get ill and then you land on this beach and you're in an insane desperation mode and you already a piece of shit. Her height, you're already a monster. He already some monster from Europe and you come over here with a fucking a free past to wreak havoc. These aren't even, people look to Brown then don't look anything like, all right, they get us gold. Hey, get that gold. How do I, how do you want me to get it? Any way you can get it.

Speaker 5:          02:29:10       Okay. I'm just cut that dude's arm off till he gives me gold. Right? I mean, what, this is all what we know happened, right? Yeah. When you're starving, I wonder if you really are a different person. Like when you hear about people like the, um, the people that came over on the, the pass in Colorado, the Donner party won a beat and each other, cause they fucking froze to death out there and they, they didn't know what to do and there was no foods. They just started hating each other. Like what? What is the switch that goes off like w who are you when that happened? So you even the same person, right? If you really are, if your personality consists of this ecosystem that we call your body, which we know for a fact has all sorts of different stuff that's going on. There's different stuff on your skin, there's different stuff in your body, there's all sorts of different bacteria that it coexists with you and even exist in a symbiotic way, right? Like you need all these things inside your body to consume the food. Like it's part of your digestive system, right? He Kolai is a natural part of the human digestive tract, right? It's all in there. What, what, what are you, when you're starving, are you, will you like some crazy wolf person? Like, what does a person like? I mean, what are they, how, how scary is someone when they're a day from starving to death and they have a knife?

Speaker 4:          02:30:27       Well, man, I mean this is the question of freewill versus no free. Well, you're saying if you get in a stressful situation, does some kind of mechanism of the swarms of organisms that make up yourself kick in where you no longer are capable of making decisions? I mean, do you even you, you absolutely. I it, I don't think it ever goes away. And I think that you always have this weird autonomy that the universal try to trick you into thinking isn't there and then suddenly you become a, um, now of course though, I think if you look at the, uh, judicial system, there is a form of murder where you don't, a temporary insanity is what they call it, right? Yeah. So, you know, there's like people who have lost

Speaker 10:         02:31:20       their fucking mind and stabbed someone to death, they prove that in court. And then in that case, you don't even go to jail. You've killed someone because you a temporarily fucking insane. But I don't know man. I think that mostly, mostly if you really watch yourself, you realize that you're, you're pretty much in control man. Like your, when I watch myself when I'm about to be an asshole, like if I'm about to do something cause I'm hangry as they call it, you're talking about the ultimate version of hangry, which is where your result to capitalism, hungry and tired, angry, hangry, hungry and angry. Hungry and angry. So like, uh, yeah, it's a good tired that's hired but, but that's higher than a shitty job but, but uh, so, but if you look at yourself even in that, when you're having like by a chemical shit going down and you're about to say something nasty to somebody usual or do something nasty, usually you're old, you're like, ah, I'm about to, um,

Speaker 3:          02:32:22       like do I give it into this horrible impulse? Yes. Do I just shit all just open my ass hole up and spray?

Speaker 10:         02:32:27       Yes. Yeah, yeah, I do. I do it. And then you do it, then you do it. You say, you know what, I'm going to fucking spray. And it's, it's just like coming to, it was just like coming, cause it's like when you're about to see if you want this thing, when you watch yourself about to have an orgasm, right? And you watch it build and build and build and build, and eventually it gets to a point where you're going to decide to come or you can't control. It may be and you're gonna fucking come, but you can watch it build and build and build. But then when you come, the orgasm is like a mild seizure of joy. Your body goes through these like, ah, there's a coal by though your entire body as a reaction, right? So in the same way, when you start getting angry, it's just like when you're fucking about to come, it's building and building and building.

Speaker 10:         02:33:14       And then you're like, you know what? I'm going to fucking tell this person how I really fucking feel to day. But you're angry and then woof, all this weird seizure shit happens. Stuff comes out of your mouth that you don't even mean. It's like half real half. Not Real. So, but you decide, you decide when to squeeze the trigger. It's not something that you don't have control of, at least mostly. And people who fool themselves into thinking that they don't have control, those are the ones who I think relegate themselves into the world of being some kind of machine, some kind of like victimy machine. I, right.

Speaker 3:          02:33:56       But you know, that's not really the free will argument. Right. You know, the full free provable argument, right? I know some freewill arguments. I get the most compelling one. That determinism one w what's compelling about it is that it doesn't exonerate you from your decisions, but what it does say is essentially to think that you are somehow another separate from the influence of

Speaker 5:          02:34:17       your life and that the influence of your life hasn't in some way influenced the way you decide to act and behave. And that a lot of those factors that led you influencing the way you act and behave, what led to you, uh, changing the way you act to behave are completely out of your control and I'm almost unavoidable in their impact and that these things shape you in some in measurable way that you'll never be completely autonomous from. You'll never be able to completely separate yourself from the influence of your genetics, of your life experiences of your neighborhood, of your mom or your dad or your upbringing, the Dell velop mental period where you may or may not have been ignored or abused or all those factors play a part in how you decide to behave and even how you decide to deal with how you decide to behave your own therapy. Like if you decided, hey man, I'm tired of jizzing all over people with my asshole. Every time I buy temperature boils up, at the end of the day I'm going to figure out how to not come home from a hard day's work at the factory and beat my wife. Like, even that is potentially determined by your past and not really, you having free will decide not to be a piece of shit.

Speaker 4:          02:35:28       Oh, okay. Right. So the, okay, so

Speaker 5:          02:35:32       not my theory, this is a, this is more of a shitty explanation of what some people have argued and Harris argued it on the podcast or I wouldn't say he's argued it. He, um, I would say that he explained it in a very interesting way. It's compelling and you have to think about it and take it into consideration when you use terms like free will.

Speaker 4:          02:35:53       Well, I would, I mean, so it gets down to this point of decision, right? So when I look at like a lot of the decisions that I make, uh, they're spontaneous and they're not, I'm not sitting around thinking like, how am I gonna turn my steering wheel at this moment as I'm on the interstate? What mild adjustments am I going to make? This is all just to kind of spontaneous thing that seems to be part of autopilot. And I know a lot of people are running on autopilot in most of what they do, but I still don't think that it, it, it negates free will. It's like a, you could think of your life as a boat and everyone's in a different shape boat and the boat's been shaped by experience. Genetics, gender. Oh, he's from my envision. What kind of boat them? What kind of vote of Mayan? Yeah. What kind of boat? My boat has to, has a fucking graying beard and one ball brother.

Speaker 4:          02:36:58       He's tried to picture a fishing boat or we in a cruise liner, like let's just say it's a fucking for a lot of people at ain't and cruise liner, right? For a lot of people. It's a raft that's built of different things that they've decided to grab out of the infinite world of phenomena and hammered together to some kind of vessel, which is their reality tunnel that they're living in and they're navigating this fucking raft. And so sure, some people, they might have a boat that is a little more cumbersome and a little more difficult to navigate through the neverending string of decisions that you have to make if you exist inside of time. But still you can, there's parts of that boat, I guarantee it, man. There's parts of your boat that you can revise. You might not be able to change at all.

Speaker 4:          02:37:46       You're probably not gonna be able to change your skin color. You're not going to be able to change your yet. People are certainly changing the gender of their fucking boats. You know, people are doing that right now. And I think is technology continues to advance. Uh, we're going to find that we're more like crispr. I think we're going to find we're more and more able to like actually change the structure of our boats according to our desire, but if you really analyze what's going on in your life, you will see that you are actively making decisions from moment to moment that are [inaudible] and who's making the decision? Well, I don't know. Well that's where it gets weird, right? If you want to say it's your gut biome, if you want to say it's the ind of a never ending series of decisions made by never an extreme of, wait a minute,

Speaker 5:          02:38:31       why does it have to be either or? Isn't it all these things? I mean that I think that's where the argument gets really weird because I think it's all these things. Yeah, it's life experiences and it's genetics and it's choices and it's consciousness and it's the willful expression of positive ideas and forcing them on your life and what is the motivation behind that? Is that your past? Is it what you've learned? Is it a fucking inspirational youtube video you watched this afternoon? Yeah. Who Cares? Whatever it is. It's a bunch of shit. It's a bunch of shit going on all over the place. And I think the idea of separating that is akin to the idea of separating us from all of the life that's on this planet. I think we've done a weird thing with houses and clothes and cars. We've done a weird thing where we're not touching the world anymore.

Speaker 5:          02:39:18       We're not touching it with our feet. We're not touching it with our skin. We're allergic to a bunch of shit. We can't get anything on us. We can't go anywhere near a certain animals. If they touch your skin, you get hives there. There's a bunch of stuff that we've done in separating ourselves from the natural world. It's left us really fucking confused, and I think one of those confusions lies in when we've created civilizations and cities, we've lost our contact, our physical contact. We don't have a physical contact. The physical contact in nature is all playing through the bottom of your boots. Uh, you're breathing it in. Still do occasionally touch it. Yeah. You occasionally brush up against a tree, but whatever influence these things have through each other and this insane network interwoven root systems and mycelium and fungus and rotting leaves and animals all around you and all that you, you get through a filter now, all that stuff you get through your car window, all that stuff you get through your clothes has share.

Speaker 5:          02:40:21       You don't, you're not in contact with that stuff anymore and by not being in contact with it, you forget that it has a message. Like when you, when you lay in the grass, just lay in the grudge, just go somewhere and lay in the grass. It feels good. It actually feels like the planet is like, like hug, like you're hugging someone. When you hug someone it feels good. Sure. It feels good to lay in a nice long as no bugs. Conti fucking hands went crawl up your ass holes good to temporary lane if you don't ask, you don't lay down in a fire ant hive and get fucked up by a bunch of bees or bees by a bunch of bugs. But I think that if you go into nature on a daily basis, like there was something that I, I I read the other day that I tweeted about them the some, I forget who the, what the university was, but they were literally saying that there is an argument that a certain amount of nature is like a, like a vitamin antidepressant.

Speaker 5:          02:41:14       Yeah. Well like you get vitamin D from the sun. Yeah. There's a certain amount of vitality. There's a certain amount of positive like life force that you get from being in nature. Makes sense man. I mean, I know that makes sense. Whenever I go out, I mean just like anything, just like I got plants now that I have to water. It was another thing I was going to talk to you about. What I was going to ask you. Do you think if these, if these scientists are correct, obviously they are about this interconnection between plants and about how they communicate with each other and about how the even allocate resources to those that are in need. Is it fucked up to keep plants? Is it fucked up to keep something that you decide? No, you're going to leave in this box, man. You're going to live in this box right here.

Speaker 5:          02:41:56       Ooh, it's round. Just keep looking for the outside. Keeps spinning around. You know you're not going to communicate with anybody else because there isn't anybody else. It's just you. It's just you lonely and fucked up sitting in this pot. Or can they communicate through the air? Are they communicating through the air and if it does it get through your windows? Man, I got 7,000 things. I got to feel bad about it. The form of fucking house plants land there. But should you have plants in your house in a pot? Should they all be outside? I mean, if they're outside with their friends, no problem. Right? If they're outside you, you got a yard and you dig a hole and you put your plants in there and you water it and it's gross and it's a part of the whole system. That's like a dog with a yard.

Speaker 5:          02:42:38       Otherwise you're, you got a German shepherd and you keep him in a fucking little con tiny kitchen. Do you haven't got him pinned in there? Do you ever do the thing where you start thinking about how funny the concept of inside and outside is? You ever do that? It's still funny cause it's like, okay, in my house I'm now inside. Even though there's just like a layer of wood around me, I'm in some other place that's different than the outside. Even though you know you're, you're really, there is no such thing as 10 side. I'll do you one better. How about, how about this? How about the phrase the great outdoors? All right. What you mean reality? You mean the earth itself? Like it is odd to be an enthusiast of the world itself. We spend so much time in these artificially created environments with air conditioning and neon light. Is it neon? Depends. Lcd Lights these days. I think this is not lcd though. Fluorescent, right. That's what I'm looking for. Neon neons like cigars. Yeah. Um, but these artificial environments that we create, we're in them way more than we are the outside. So when we're actually in the outdoors, we can call ourselves, I'm an outdoorsman. What do you like to do? I like to the great outdoors. That's what I like, Bro. Sure. I like to be in the great outdoors. Yeah, great outdoors is, instead of saying the world nature, I'm a nature enthusia.

Speaker 10:         02:44:05       I love nature in all its forms, man, including houses, virtual reality, not, not just being in a fucking house, Joe, but being inside another universe inside the house. That is what I like and it's, and also guess what? Because a lot of anti vr people, they're like, whenever I got out, y'all forget about outside. No, I go outside, enjoy the sun, enjoy my shitty little garden with a speaking of fucking cruelty to plants, God forbid you become one of my plans. God forbid, may you never be one of my plants, but I still go out there and I try to keep them alive. But man, Vr is such a beautiful thing because it creates that same, almost the same sense of like, you know like when you go in a big space and it feels good. I don't know why, but you aware it can be a shitty warehouse, but if it's big, if you go into like an expansive plane, they're like, that's why it was good.

Speaker 5:          02:45:07       I put a is up from the Vatican, there was in the Vatican last week or two weeks ago and I went to St Peter's basilica and I put a bunch of photos of it on my instagram feed. If you ever been to the Vatican, not yet. You got to go. First of all, it is trippy psychedelic. There's a giant pine cone. Okay. They have this huge courtyard with a huge pine cone, which represents the pineal gland and these two peacocks that represent eternal life. He cocks. Apparently that's, I took that photo. Um, the, uh, the guide was super psyched when I knew at the pine cone, met his eyes lit up and I say represents the pineal gland, right? And he's like, how do you know that? And then we started talking about Christianity and its potential routes in psychedelic drugs and ancient Roman culture and how, you know, like the John Marco Allegro book, the sacred mushroom and the scroll where he thought that what Christianity was initially was a bunch of stories where they hid the psychedelic rituals in parables and stories to hit it from the Romans because when they were being conquered by the Romans, they didn't them to know how magical the mushrooms were and they were a connection to God and that the pineal gland, like I forget the actual chemical composition of DMT, but or not the, uh, not dmt rather, but mushrooms.

Speaker 5:          02:46:22       But what DMT is diamond, the tryptamine is in some form. That's what happens to psychedelic mushrooms when you taken psilocybin. I think it's, I think it's like for Fox, for a [inaudible], and I know I'm butchering it and, and dimethyl trip to me, but it's some version of dimethyltryptamine is produced when you consume psilocybin mushrooms. So these guys knew that, they knew that. And then it was a part of their art and it represented that pineal gland is giant fucking 15 foot tall pine cone represented what they thought was the seat of the soul. That's why it's sitting there and this fucking, this gigantic tray being held up by angels and Shit and whoever those saints see to this sill. See that's the fucking vr goggles for the soul. That's what that is. That's the way we peer into this dimension. Look at the St Peter's Basilica.

Speaker 5:          02:47:15       These photos, this is from [inaudible] that they built in the 16 hundreds with no, they had no computers. They had no power tools. They had no, and there's photos on my instagram. There it is. So cool dude. You're seeing it right now in a picture and I'm telling you it doesn't do it justice. This thing's insane. It took hundreds of years to fully complete and the size of it and the scale of it, it's mine. But there's one photo that I put, we can see the actual people in the background look at the size of that fucking place. And that is a small sliver of how big the places, I'm telling you, it's not doing it any justice. It's perfect. The artwork is staggering. I mean, staff, everybody talks about the Sistine Chapel, the sistine chapels. Pretty fucking beautiful. I mean, without a doubt, it's a modern, I mean, not a modern, uh, an amazing work of art.

Speaker 5:          02:48:09       But it ain't shit compared to St Peter's Basilica. Look at that. It's the all seeing eye to this is, that's the, that's the sunroof. That's the, that's an eyeball. Whatever it is. I don't know if you now look at that, that's definitely an eyeball. A bunch of people in the eyeball and there are angels. There's angels got stuck in God's eyeball. Couldn't that just be alive? It was impossible. It's just whole light. No, Joe, look right underneath that. I see that pyramid right under the eye, dude. How the fuck did they even climb up there? That, that's a, um, a photo of Hercules, that last one that's a gigantic bronze Hercules that they buried in the second century. They build it in the second century d but it got hit by lightning twice. And they went, this thing is fucking Honda head. So they buried him. They buried it underground. They didn't find it until 1864 wow. He's an amazing dude that the Vatican is a mind. Fuck. That floor is 1700 years old and you walk on it. Everybody walks on it. Thousands of people a day walk on a 1700 year

Speaker 3:          02:49:07       old mosaic floor.

Speaker 4:          02:49:09       Pretty cool man. That's where they say they've got all these like hidden manuscripts and shit that no one's ever going to see. That's what you would initially gravitate to. Wouldn't you? Secrets the secrets. Are you kidding? The Vatican's filled with secrets, man. A little boy's secrets. David notches that lots of other shit too, man. They've been gathering information. I mean, think about it. It's like they, they've controlled so many world leaders who have done confessions and you think that the Vatican doesn't like when a world leader gives a confession, doesn't write that shit down, put it in the fucking lie. They probably have confessions of some of the greatest kings. They knew everything. Man. It's the priest class freaking me out. It's true. You're freaking me out. Anyway. I hope I am. I man, that's a fucking Vatican. Think about what that is. That there are a country.

Speaker 4:          02:50:03       Yeah, it's a country. It's a small country. It's a hundred acre country. Every time a Catholic puts money in a bowl, it a little bit of that money makes it to that fucking place. That's the nexus point of dough for one of the world's one branch of the world's main religions. That's a fucking cool. That's just all the money. People who are like just at the end of their fucking rope, people who have like $3,000 left in their bank account, but they were like, you know what? I'm going to give this to the church because God will bless me. They give that money to the church and that money goes straight to build an a fucking shitty lightening catching statue. That's what all the money of people who desperately needed it for actual things has gotten sucked to the Vatican where it's used to build gold thrones that the pope sits on and talks about the importance of charity. It's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          02:51:03       Well, he did. The new guy doesn't do it anymore. The new guy doesn't do sit on the throne. Now here's a real chair. He could archive six the most intriguing documents and church history. Oh my God. Documents from the Galileo heresy trial. I'd throw that one out of, I was the Catholic Church. Let's forget about that. Forget about that. She told me you wouldn't want to read that when they were telling him, hey dude, you're wrong. The Earth is the center of the fucking universe now. Either you want to stay in that attic for the rest of your life like that. A serial killer lady and with that lady, serial killer lady, what was her name? But Oh, killed all the young women.

Speaker 4:          02:51:40       Henry this seventh asking for a divorce, an anoma. A king has to ask your permission. You've become so powerful. Kings are like, can I please break up with my girlfriend?

Speaker 3:          02:51:50       That's Henry the eighth he was the one that chopped their heads off,

Speaker 4:          02:51:53       right? Yeah. That's the ultimate enjoyment. That's when he got sick of sending letters.

Speaker 3:          02:51:58       They still use v I. We had a guess. You know, you said the seventh and I said the eighth I had account those little lines.

Speaker 4:          02:52:06       That reminds me, I'm sure you've already talked about this in the podcast and it's stupid. So go ahead and call me stupid if, and I'm sorry if you already told pre-claim things you know about the baron, you know the berenstain bears? Yes. Yes. Fuck yeah. We've probably got a million vice had a whole lot

Speaker 3:          02:52:22       article about it. I didn't, I didn't really remember it, so it wasn't that much of a revelation to me. I don't think I read that when I was a kid. I was more of a Dr Seuss turned kid. I didn't understand that it was, everybody thought it was steam,

Speaker 4:          02:52:34       but it was what I thought. And then, yeah, I definitely thought that. But the idea that some people remember that Nelson Mandela died in prison and some people think he got out. That's the trippiest idea. Have you ever, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:52:46       Queen Song, we are the champions. Everybody think it ends with of the world, but it doesn't, it just ends and everybody tries to sing of the world, but it doesn't end that way. Like there's a funny thing that this guy does on youtube where he gets in a car and he drives people around, they lip sync, they sing along like Karaoke. Rather they sing along to songs and they're singing along to the queen song. We are the champions and it gets to the end and it's George. Um, what the fuck's his name? The actor, George Clooney and Julia Roberts and uh, someone else. I forget who the other person is and they're singing along and it gets to the end and they all want to say of the world and it doesn't say that. And they're like, what the fuck? And they're all confused. And I thought it did too.

Speaker 3:          02:53:31       Everybody does. It seems like there's a, a line that we all collectively decided was missing from that song. It's a collective fuck up of memory time, traveler proof. I wish we could play it, but we can't play it. They'll yank is off youtube, but find the video. See just to see if you can find the video so we could tell people what video to watch because it's hilarious watching George Clooney get to the end and want to say, Oh man, what a bad motherfucker Freddie Mercury was. You ever listened to queen every now and again throwing some queen.

Speaker 4:          02:54:07       It's insane. Jesus. He was good. He was so Bohemian. Rhapsody would play that. And you're like, what? Like what a, what an amazing piece of expression. He seems like he was one of the most disciplined people when it came to his work. Like it's, he seems like somebody who is constantly working on his voice. Just a workaholic maybe. Maybe for sure. Unbelievably talented and [inaudible] and had an incredible knack for expressing himself. How she wasn't even at some NPR interview with, uh, I can't remember. She's a famous broadway singer and she's talking about what she does every day and it's crazy. Oh to sing on Broadway. Oh God. She's like, it's like three hours of physical exercise a day mixed in with an hour of meditation. Makes them with vocal exercises. So it's like every single day she's doing like an eight hour prep for this shit that she's doing. It's amazing when you

Speaker 3:          02:55:07       hear about people who are at that discipline. Yeah. That's not good for us. We can't do that shit, dude. What is this is them, they get to the end. Oh, it's Gwen Steffani was the other one. We owe the chain the chain. Okay. We can't play it because it's not the music. It's just dumb singing. But we can't do it because it's their video yet. It's James Corden show. Who's James Corden? The late, late show he took over for Craig Ferguson this past year, I think. Here they go. They get to the part at the end. No, we don't have to see this. I'm scared. Yeah, we're going to get yanked off youtube. Uh, there was a big thing that I tweeted today where some guy was talking about his audio book being on Youtube. Oh yeah, I saw that. Yeah. And people are, this guy said that he sold 50,000 audio books, but there was like 19,000 views or something like that on Youtube.

Speaker 3:          02:56:00       And he was like, what in the fuck? Like that's a giant chunk of the people that have listened to my book, pirated it, you know, and he's like, Hey, I get, this is how I make a living when I get paid from this stuff. It's interesting because you know, obviously youtube has them up and they, you know, somehow or another, someone puts it up there and they didn't get it down without a request. Like Yep, there's an algorithm that finds it. You have to find it. So like it's totally possible. I'm sure a lot of your bits or up there somewhere where someone's put them up and they put them up on the channel. You just don't, you don't know. You mean from the podcast, from podcasts, from staff, from, but imagine if you had a book and you made all your money. If you're an author or you make all your money off the audio book or a big percentage at least, can't they just claim 100 right? Claim wonders, get it off. But those 19,000 views he doesn't get, those are gone. You know,

Speaker 4:          02:56:51       like how many of those 19,000 views would have translated into selling an audio book? Is that real

Speaker 3:          02:56:57       question is the real question, if any. And here's the real question for standups, right? The always the question is when you are bits, make it on youtube, like say if you do a comedy central special in particular, right. And then your bits make it on youtube, the more people pirate your stuff. I don't know if you'd call it pirating, but more they take it and they put it on Youtube, the more people are going to see you, the more people are going to come to see you, the more it's going to be worth it to you to do another comedy central spot. Right? Right. So it becomes different for us because we, we kind of exist for the live shows, like the live shows, the big, big part of what we do. Right? Yeah. And anything that'll get more people to go to the live shows, it's like a better thing, right? Yeah. Yeah. How it thinks how now for an author, for that guy, he's, he feels like he got fucked. You know,

Speaker 4:          02:57:42       well I think, wasn't he saying that like Youtube, like culpable here, like youtube is making money off of the thing in some indirect way that and acting like they're not like it is like who's the person who is because the person who uploaded it, are they generating money from the thing or are they, did they just upload it because love it? That's a good

Speaker 10:         02:58:02       question. I don't know. Yeah, that, that, that's where it gets weird is it? And, and I think in the article he was saying how, you know, with a lot of music now, thank God when you upload it on your Youtube Stream, they just get a, they just get the profits from whatever you're advertising. And that's way better than what it used to be. They just need, they need to upgrade the system. So this guy gets the same deal he has with audible anytime somebody listens to the book.

Speaker 5:          02:58:28       Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that he deserves that for sure. But here's my weirdness about all this. You know, we were talking about language and the limitations of language and the eventuality of a virtual reality. And I wonder how we're going to digest data and information in a virtual world. Like if people decide like what if you decide that you want to read books in a virtual world, this is how you want to read books. The way you want to read books is what your feet up on the couch in your mansion and your virtual world. All these girls around you like finger banging themselves with a high heels on and Queens, fat bottom girls. You make a rock in the world, go round, plays in the background share, and you get to sit down and read books in a virtual world. What happens then? Like what? What happens when you're watching movies in a virtual world? That's probably, that'd be stupid. Famous streaming. I think the movies would be, they would exist. I think movies in a virtual world, they're definitely coming, right? And they're going to, you're going to exist in the world like you're not gonna sit down and watch a movie.

Speaker 10:         02:59:29       Oh No. They have a great theory theaters in Vr now you can sit down, put on a movie and watch it on. Unlike a massive screen in vr there. I went to, don't you think,

Speaker 5:          02:59:40       why do they do that as their limitations in the medium where they can't have it? Uh, the movie play out in front of you. Like if you went to see jaws,

Speaker 10:         02:59:47       oh, that's dope. It's kind of Nice to watch a movie floating in space. I don't mind that the virtue of you, there's an app called virtual desktop where you like, you put on your vr goggles and suddenly your desktop is wrapped around you, a giant screen, giant screen wrapped around you that you then can like pull up any kind of movie you might want to watch. And so you just like can sit in there and why. And if you look down, you see space. Yeah, that's it. Virtual desktop that. Now the problem with Vr, when you look at that, the problem with Vr, like people looking at it on the Internet is it you cannot convey how fucking cool it looks from looking at it that way. Like it is suddenly there's this massive thing in front of you. The space look real, what the space looked real. Um, it, it looks real enough pretty. I wouldn't say that. I mean I wouldn't say realistic. I think there are probably some, there's got to be by now some three 60 videos that are actually from the, from Hubble, but it looks good enough where you're like, this is fucking incredible. Well what's the benefit

Speaker 3:          03:01:00       of like they're just watching you play a video game. What's the benefit and playing a video game on a screen in a virtual world instead of playing the video game in the virtual world? Well I think, but honestly in that case, I don't know. Like I've, I started a game up in there and he's like, fuck this. You see what I'm saying here? Because like he's clicking and menus and stuff. He's using it like a computer.

Speaker 10:         03:01:19       Yeah. I think it's a, I don't know if the benefit is the right thing to look for there. It's just, it's just bad ass to like suddenly be completely immersed in a new environment doing like whatever the work is that you want to do that with virtual desktop. I just use it to watch documentaries

Speaker 3:          03:01:40       about bleeding. But what I'm thinking is like, would you rather like, okay, like they're perfect example, you're looking at a screen, right? Clearly a floating screen, if you watch jaws and that floating screen, that would not be as good as if you were sitting in your living room when you're looking down. You were on the boat with Roy Scheider. Well he was like, we're gonna need a bigger boat. Oh, you mean like if there was like a vr jaws? Yes. Oh yeah, that'd be fucking cool. It just doesn't exist yet. Right. But that's what I'm saying. Like that's going to happen. Right? Of course. Yeah, that'll definitely happen for sure. No question. And when they do things like that, like will you be able to enjoy other things in that world? Like will you be able to go into that world? Like here we're in the Swiss Alps, where the fuck we are in a fake world? Would you be able to go to this place and put on a, an a, a podcast? Like would you be able to like look down at your phone, find the Duncan trussell family hour and start streaming it live on your phone while you're skiing down the side of this virtual hill, which you're building.

Speaker 10:         03:02:37       You can already, you can already do that. You could already do that. Yeah. Look, I mean look man, this is like rick and Morty is video game is in Vr is accepting that you're in vr and, and they're, they're, yeah, there's like there's a, there's all kinds of shit you could do in there. Like for example, man, there's a, um, in one of these games called fantastic contraption, which is one of the most site dude show, split reality, fantastic contraption. If you looked at this where people have managed to put up a green screen so that can interpolate the two videos. So it looks like you're actually in the game. That's the clothes show. That fantastic contraption is this. Everything in there is fucking psychedelic. But check this out. When you see people in the, in the reality itself, yeah. There you go.

Speaker 3:          03:03:26       Whoa. Watch what he does. So this guy's walking around. This is what he's seeing. So what we're looking at and what are we seeing? Does this gonna what? We're going to kicked off use youtube for this. You don't need the daughter? Yeah. Don't know audio please. I'm worried. But then so this guy's moving around and while he's moving around, he's doing a bunch of stuff. He's got a bunch of front of house one though. For sure. There's like, well it takes to explain to the people that are listening what we're saying.

Speaker 10:         03:03:49       Oh yeah, you're, you're just seeing like in fantastic contraption. What is that? What is fantastic contraption? You're in this like weird putting green and you have to build amazing devices to um, Eh, the white. Unfortunately these videos, you're not seeing the guy actually form the shit. Like watch this.

Speaker 3:          03:04:07       What am I watching Dunkin? We started, people are listening. Watch this. Oh, sorry.

Speaker 10:         03:04:11       You're seeing, look at this. Look at this. You have to stretch out these like tubes to build this weird device that you like then automates itself to try to, I mean, honest to God, talking about it, you feel like a fucking, you're listening to an eight year old talk about a drawing

Speaker 3:          03:04:26       they made. Like what? What are you talking about? It's impossible to convey. It's a game and it's a game where this guy is moving, he's got devices in his hand and then devices move things in the virtual world. He's holding on to these two like a controllers. But this is not a good, if you look up crazy matter, it's pretty fucking he fucking cool. Yeah. You'll see it on Friday. I'll show you. I've got us and what we need to talk about his porn.

Speaker 10:         03:04:51       What's that like Duncan? What's it like in this world? What's it like? So, um, I mean it's like I'll tell you something even better than porn man. Oh. Um, here's what's really cool about vr that I don't think a lot of people have caught onto. Maybe a few of them have. Cause the porn of course is amazing. It is an, it is. If anything is going to drive vr and I hope everything drives Vr, it's going to be the fucking porn because the porn that is shot for Vr is very, very close to like experiencing having sex with someone, obviously minus the body. Right? There's nobody there. There's nobody there. But it's amazing and it's going to cause a lot of great and hilarious problems. And I'm excited to hear the outrage that comes from the world when people start realizing that every single person on earth now has access not just to in a voyeuristic way witnessing, uh, Ooh, that, that I'm telling you man, that is, that's,

Speaker 3:          03:06:01       that's what those girls acids and insane and so she's right in front of you. But this is, they're not doing a good job with us cause it's got to

Speaker 10:         03:06:07       eyeball. That's just how it, yeah, you, you, you have to use virtual desktop to bring those two things together. Like the porn that you download is broken up in stereoscopic. So the vr goggles bring it together

Speaker 3:          03:06:21       to kill you. You have to get specific programs that are designed for this, right?

Speaker 10:         03:06:26       Yeah. Like a, yeah, just google search. Reddit, how not to watch vr porn.

Speaker 3:          03:06:32       So these guys that are watching it, like we're watching this guy who's sitting on his bed and like he's looks like he's doing everything to keep from coming in his pants. He's laugh like I don't ever watch porn like that. There's like sheer joy and him watching that porn, like what you're talking about is something that's very different than watching a two dimensional screen.

Speaker 10:         03:06:49       It's, it's as different as sax and watching a two dimensional screen except there's no body there. I mean you are in, you look or you can look around, you can like, you know, like for example, let's say there was a, and by the way, I'm not doing this shit. A friend of mine watches it, but let's say, let's say that there was a, um, let's say that there was a, uh, uh, in a, in a vr porn experience, there's a girl who's giving you a blow job while another girl is shoving your pussy in your face. You can actually look up and see your pussy, not our pussy. You can look around her pussy and see, see your face looking down at you just like it was really happening. So that's Vr porn. That's what it's alignment. You can look at her pussy and then you can go back to sure the girls sucking your Dick.

Speaker 10:         03:07:39       You give, you have, you can move anywhere. You could stare at her feet if you're a Weirdo or not. If you just were a fan of feet either way, either way. Either way. It's, it's, it's, and it's still a game changer. It's a game changer, man. It's a game changer and it's one of the many freedoms the virtual reality's offering people. It's like you were saying, who wants to like even just watching a movie in two D in your virtual reality room, it's pretty awesome. Maybe you don't have the greatest apartment, right? But you put on vr goggles and suddenly your apartment has transformed into a, into a massive, beautiful space in the htc vive. It comes with like Vr home and there's two different versions. But when you go into this space, you feel that same sense of expansiveness that you get from being in a big space, right?

Speaker 10:         03:08:34       Like it's, your body's still like, feels like it's, you know, you're in a, you still feel that weird sense of freedom that you feel when you're in a big space and you're not there. It's beautiful, man. It's like one of the most liberating, incredible technologies. I think that a lot, some people are giving it a little bit of a hard time right now because they see the game from Youtube and they think those graphics look like Shit. But let me tell you, man, do minecraft in Vr. Like I just, I did minecraft and Vr. I play my graft vr regularly now, but you do minecraft and vr and when suddenly you're perched on the edge of a cliff looking down on some hyper colored underground river, your body initially reacts in the same way or reacts to being at the edge of a real cliff.

Speaker 10:         03:09:27       Your balance gets weird. You're like, fuck, fuck, fuck. It's that real. That's the vive. The htc vive is in fucking saying, Jesus, I can't wait to show you man. It's like, it just works. It doesn't, it doesn't mess up. Like anytime I want to now I can go. I've made a room in my house where now I can just put on these goggles and I'm instantly in. Oh fucking there's a game called a hover junkers, which is so fun. So you, um, you, you could, you could probably pull it up. You ride around like it knows how big the space is that what's called your play space. They knows how big it is. So you're riding in a craft in this place, space shooting weapons at people flying around in these other things. Yeah. It's so you could like, you could all go in your garage and you could, uh, the garage would become the environment where you're playing your game.

Speaker 10:         03:10:26       Oh yeah. Man, you're not in your garage anymore. You're flying around in that fucking thing shooting at people, which means you actually have to be good at shooting. Like you have to be able to aim, this isn't like pressing buttons. Like, you need to know how to fire at least at some Saudi, what are you holding? Are you holding a fake gun? Now you're holding these controllers that feel exactly like a fucking, they feel very close to a gun and it's got haptic technology. So when you're shooting it's vibrating. I wonder if this would actually teach you how to shoot better. They have, they have a great archery program. Is, is it making your art tree better? Uh, it's making me not do archery cause I just do it. It's way easier. Are you good at it? Are you good at this archery? Yeah, it me doing real archery jet definitely translated into me playing look up the, I'm sorry to keep asking. You look up stuff. Jamie. Look up, uh, archery. The lab vr. This is one of my favorite archery programs. They also have a vr boxing, which I haven't tried yet, but which I'm excited about because that seems like you could really train people to learn how to box.

Speaker 10:         03:11:32       Let's see. I'm s I don't know if this is, yeah, that's, that's a different archery program than the one that look up the lab.

Speaker 13:         03:11:43       Okay.

Speaker 10:         03:11:44       Ah, fuck. It's, it's valve look up valve archery. Vr. Now there is, yeah. This one's a really fucking fun man.

Speaker 13:         03:11:52       Okay.

Speaker 10:         03:11:53       Yeah. This one is fucking cool. You just shoot it. These little guys who are trying to infiltrate your, oh, so you're shooting at things. Yeah. And it's, so it's a game. Yeah. My God. And you are you pulling a bow back? Like what are you doing in your hand? So you have two controllers, you're pulling them back. There's haptics. So it vibrates according to this, the tension of the bow string. And then when you want an Arrow, you're reaching behind your back and pulling it from behind your back. Dot is nuts, man. Yeah, it's so fun. I wonder if it actually could help your archery skill for sure. The only problem is it's really weird because you get used to like, um, it's different because you use a compound bow, but you know, you get, you know, it's, it's kind of same. You get used to like I have a place on my cheek where I put my point, the anchor point changes cause the goggles right up here. So you have to get a new anchor point. But it's still pretty fucking fun. I mean how often you get to shoot at things in and like an archery range like this? Yeah, this is wild. And I wonder, that means it should

Speaker 2:          03:12:52       definitely be able to do something like this for a compound bows. That's say go deer hunting with it. There's another archery program that you can get on steam that it looks pretty cool. Uh, I can't remember the name of it though, but it looks a little bit more, I guess, realistic. Well, they have an archery program. See if you could find this archery program where you shoot at a virtual screen, you actually shoot a real bow at, uh, these images on a screen. And this, uh, like you, you go to like in front of like a giant movie theater type thing and you stand in front of this thing and these animals walked by. I, that's cool. And they run from you and they hide and you got to sneak up on them and shoot arrows at them. I mean I'm sure this will be translated into vr and I'll tell you joe, if I was, if I were you man, I would be developing shit for Vr.

Speaker 2:          03:13:37       Right? Developing. Yeah. God Damn it. It's not a developer. I would, I, there's so many ideas that you will have when you try these goggles on where you're going to be like this, this needs to exist in the world, get this shit developed man. Because it's gonna like there's so many things that once you experience it where like Oh someone needs to build this. Someone like for example a fucking boxing, Jamie's nodding in the, in the one hour I think I got a demonstration of it. I was just sitting there asking the guy, so what about when someone gets a hold of this and they start thinking about doing this thing and what about when rock star gets it and then they start thinking about making grand theft auto this way. It's like, yes Zach, your brain just steak. Well fallout is coming for the vive, which is going to be pretty fucking cool.

Speaker 2:          03:14:20       But dude from the, and they have like a a boxing program that looks like it's still in development but a fucking real boxing program because it tracks the controllers perfectly in real time. So you could actually learn how to box. Yes. Someone needs to build a real fun, not only learn how to box, but you could train with the great boxers like you could throw kicks to, well you'd have to have something on your foot. You'd have to have another edition. It was like that could be done boots right. Easily man. Easily kind of sneakers that you get a great fucking workout too. Oh I'm sure. I remember when people were doing dance dance revolution. They lost tons of weight. Yeah, there was a huge thing a lot of guys lost and gals lost a ton of weight off that dance dance revolution again cause it was so fun to do.

Speaker 2:          03:15:06       Well, that's what's funny about Vr is that right now when people think of a video Gamer, they don't, you're not going to hear someone say, Oh, they are lean and Tan and they like her deck. They have such dexterity. But now when you think of someone who's great at Vr, they're going to, you gotta be in fucking Shit. There's the boxing program. I'm going to download it. The creators of this, or seem like they're super cool. I think I could get a good workout with this. They have vr pool. How good. I don't want that pools for real. But see, the thing about this is this is something that you could do on your own and get a workout in. What I, what I find interesting about this too is you could tune a dude up and you don't feel bad about it right now. What you need to do eventually is they're going to

Speaker 5:          03:15:50       have something that looks like this, but it's a robot. Like both things. Like you have a thing that you can actually hit.

Speaker 10:         03:15:56       Well now you could just, you could already, I'm sure there's a way that you could hang a bag and um, cause like, okay, so when I, um, what I'm talking about southern the hits back, well yeah, that's that, that's going to be something that phrase,

Speaker 5:          03:16:11       it doesn't have to have a lot of power. They could have like a really mushy arm and it knows how to move the way, the way you move, like

Speaker 10:         03:16:20       Zach's a throwing punches at you. So if it hits you, it's not hurting you. You know what that could be, man. It can be like a haptic face mask that registers the punch and vibrates so that you could feel it, you know, and wherever it hits you, it could

Speaker 5:          03:16:34       be, but it also could be like some sort of a robot that has inflatable arms and the inflatable arms move with the program. So as you're looking at Apollo creed in front of you, when he snaps his jab out at you pop, he's, he's throwing this like spongy, almost like a inflatable raft balloon arm. You know, like when you're little kids inflatable balloon toys.

Speaker 10:         03:17:00       Yeah, I like that. Like, he's not going to hurt you at all. It's just going to touch your face. Be fucking incredible. And what's in, what you're going to see, man, is people are going to get really good at this shit. Like if you're good at shooting and vr minus like the heft of the gun and the real kick of whatever gun in the real world. Are you using your, it's, it's going to translate. We are tomorrow and just float in Pasadena. Um, Zach, Larry and I are testing out, I think for the first time Vr in a float tank and Zach leary, Timothy leary's son Timothy leary. Are you up to Duncan trussell Oh, you dropping out and tuning in and we're trying to induce the observer effect. We've got this awesome guy, Dustin, who's, uh, helped us, um, help helped us build a floating in space program. So the idea is, can you like induced the effect astronauts report when they're floating in space looking down on earth. If you, if you put someone in the zero g or the Semis Erg of a float tank and give them the impression that they're staring down on planet earth and we've got this genius designer is, I haven't looked at it yet.

Speaker 5:          03:18:07       You are freaking me the fuck out right now. Well let's hope it works man. I mean this is something that makes sense to me in my world. The world of the float. Yeah man. We'll know like something like that, like adding floating to it. You know, crash was trying to do something similar a long time ago. He was developing programs. He developed a screen crash from the float lab, I should say. He's the one of the big innovators have a floating tanks in this country. He developed a screen that had one of the lowest emissions of light possible so that when you be lying down in this tank, complete darkness, you would look up at the screen and the amount of light came out. It was so minuscule that allowed you to see clearly the images but didn't show a the line of

Speaker 3:          03:18:48       a screen. So you were never removed from this idea that you're floating through the universe, but in front of you while these things are playing out and he had this idea that you would learn things easier that way. Like you could watch like a golf documentary or a golf, a instructional rather, and you could learn like how to swing a golf club properly because you would be seeing it through a first person perspective.

Speaker 4:          03:19:07       Well, um, Zach's dad had this idea, I think it's called the Timothy leary. Tim leary probably say who his dad was. Tim Timothy. Timothy leary had this idea of the eight circuits of clothes. Zach's dad. Yeah, maybe sweetie. Well, I mean any w and he was a fucking sweetie. Tim leary was like Tim Timothy leary was, he was, I put them on the same level as Galileo. He was an incredibly brilliant human being and a lot of his ideas got lost and is like he, he gets called an lsd propagandist, but there's a lot of other shit he was coming up with. And I'm one of those was this model, I think it's the eight circuits of consciousness. So the idea is that humans are meant to migrate into space. And that in the same way like different creatures, when they enter into new habitats, they actually change a little bit.

Speaker 4:          03:20:00       There's, or in other words, like you take a a sea turtle, he's laid eggs in the sand and the first time a little baby sea turtle climbs out of the egg and burroughs out of the sand. It's a land creature until it hits water. And then all of a sudden all of this other instinctual shit kicks in and it learns how to be a sea turtle. More than likely it gets eaten. Not a lot of them make it, but the ones that survive become sea turtles. Right? So, so the idea is that humans are meant for interstellar, for, for tr, for travel in space, and that if we go into zero g then over what could potentially happen, uh, our changes in our psyche and maybe even in our genetic makeup, like maybe if we go into space long enough, we'll start transforming into some new creature that we were meant to be. So

Speaker 3:          03:20:53       was it ed Mitchell that was talking about the experience of being in space that he would like to take everybody up there and that you would realize how ridiculous boundaries are and how ridiculous wars are. If you could see the earth as a whole, the way he saw it

Speaker 4:          03:21:08       at Mitchell, is he still alive?

Speaker 3:          03:21:11       I believe he is Mitchell or trying to do it for your brother and mental is not alive. No, he died. Ah, well what was a, he was an interesting guy. He was an interesting one because he was really into Ufos, especially before he died. He was one of the more compelling cases of someone who went into space and came back with a profound belief in Ufos. But you know, it's always hard. You don't know the guy. I don't know the guy. I don't know what his motivation was. I hope he was being honest. But there's a lot of money and you lfos if you're a fucking astronaut and you want to cash in, that's the best way. I'm not, I'm not saying

Speaker 5:          03:21:46       that he would do it. I'm not saying that, but the cynic in me has to always go, well, how well do they take care of their astronauts? I mean, how well did they get? I'll tell you what, man, if you can tap into some of that sweet, sweet ufo money, it's a lot of money in them. UFO books, little green men. I want little green bits of paper, motherfucker. I mean, it's not like Hillary Clinton speaking fees. But if you can get a former us astronauts who went to the moon to sit down and talk to you about the little green men that he might have seen or the idea that they might exist.

Speaker 10:         03:22:19       Well, you know what, man, you, you know, there are nefarious people in this world and I don't know if fucking had Mitchell I saw Ufo is or not. It wouldn't surprise me that there are, uh, other creatures that you run into up there that for whatever reason, you're not supposed to announce, I don't know man.

Speaker 5:          03:22:36       Totally possible. Look, if we could send a robot to Mars, there's totally possible that something's up there. It's totally possible that something is around the earth. All the time. We just don't get a chance to see it.

Speaker 10:         03:22:46       I mean, this is what Terence Mckenna always talked about. It's like we spent all this money on these telescopes when for however you don't even, most people won't even sell you DMT. They give it to you. But like when you know, just like however much it costs for whatever the device you use to inhale the DMT or however much the it cost you to get down to wherever the IOWASCA Sharman was or whatever it is, you're going to encounter things that seem to have a personality that is not your personality and that they don't have a normal human body. And you know, I was just reading Alistair Crawley last night and he's talking about, we use the term angel, not because we're saying there's some angel out there, but it's more convenient than saying here is a representation of the higher form of human intelligence that is come and in the form of an archetype that our brains translate as an angel. It's just easier to call it an angel for the sake of just pragmatism because you want to achieve some goal. Just call it a fucking angel. We used to call aliens angels. That's what we used to call him.

Speaker 5:          03:23:55       The idea of a person with no possible way of measuring what something is, even if, whether you have an experience or not, I have to take your word for it. I'm assuming you had an experience, you said it was an angel. The idea of putting a label on that, a definitive label like, oh, I definitely met an angel. Right? How the fuck do you know what an angel is? Right? How do you know it was an alien? It was definitely an alien. You sure it wasn't an angel? How do you know? You don't know. You're guessing, right? You don't know what an angel is or an alien isn't. As a matter of fact, you shouldn't be able to say those words because you don't even know what the fuck they mean either one of those words. You're just saying nonsense. And for you to be like super definitive about it. Like you're, you're, you're, you're definitely sure that it was an angel or you're definitely sure that it was an alien. You're crazy. You don't even know what you saw. Well, you don't have anything that you can bring back. There's no physical matter where you brought to a scientist and bunch of peer reviewed scientists from all over the world studied it and determined that this was actually alien tissue. Now there's none of that. So no matter what it is, the labels ridiculous,

Speaker 10:         03:24:53       right? And they get caught up in the label is, is of to waste your time unless you're using the label is a, is something to expedite your ability to recontact that thing in which case labels are fantastic. But if you're using the label to say, Oh yes, this is definitely an angel, and then you're like getting in the most insanely stupid arguments over that, then it's a bit of a waste of time. But if you have an experience, for example, I don't know, you smoked dmt and you come into contact with it's self transforming machine elves that as Terence Mckenna, hyperspace and hyperspace, right? So is that really what those things call themselves? If they could? No, of course not. But as a tool or a means of trying to in some way bring the uh, transcendent into this dimension, then language is a, is a necessity. You have no choice.

Speaker 5:          03:25:45       Well not just that, but in Mckenna's case it was part of the grand theater of being someone who is a, a dmt evangelist. Right? I mean, part of his, his art of what he is is a performer. Like I'm a big fan of his lectures. I enjoyed watching him talk, I enjoyed listening to him talk, but part of what he was doing was very entertaining. He had this oddly soothing voice, this brilliant vocabulary. And one of the things he did in one of these interviews that he did a, he was a, not interviews rather a, he's do q and a's with the audience would ask them questions about psychedelic drugs and things along those lines. Um, someone was asking him something and he said, you know, they were like, well, what can you do and how do you differentiate and how do you keep from being arrested?

Speaker 5:          03:26:27       He goes, well, no, I use big words, you know, and he's a, he's a legitimate scholar. And he's like, if you come up with slogans like dropout tune in, like, yeah, he goes, that's when they come and he goes, I keep it low key. I have these small meetings, they rarely get over a thousand people. And uh, I use a lot of really big words and a, I use the, the richest vocabulary for description that I can muster up. Right. It was interesting because like you listen to, and he's obviously like incredibly well educated, right? And incredibly knowledgeable about the actual physical compounds of all these different psychedelics and their mechanisms for interaction and the monoamine oxidase inhibitors. And all these different things that he's saying that are like, it causes like people who are not that smart to go, oh, okay. We let them

Speaker 10:         03:27:21       go. Let him keep talking to her. I hope to God they don't care that much about people talking about that stuff, man. It and I, it's not, they, I don't know. I don't

Speaker 5:          03:27:31       believe there's a day. Don't, there's a few people that are they, but those few people that are, they the, they're bankers and their industrialists and there the military industrial that people that are earning money off of wars and controlling resources, if you really think that they are somehow or another actively trying to uh, and capture or capture people that are talking openly about psychedelics, they don't have time for that shit

Speaker 10:         03:27:55       either way, if I really don't think they do. Have you seen that video of Tim leary in front of the Senate and a hearing

Speaker 5:          03:28:00       that was like 1960? What was it? I want to say it was like,

Speaker 10:         03:28:05       I don't know, the year. It's one of the funniest fucking things ever. This is our cause he's a madman and he's in front of these like just hardcore politicians talking about the LSD experience.

Speaker 5:          03:28:16       Do you think will get pulled off youtube if we play that?

Speaker 10:         03:28:19       I think that's public fucking don't we own that? Cause it's a s

Speaker 5:          03:28:23       it should, it should be the, it'd be a historical thing. Well there's a, there's a amount of time things have to right.

Speaker 10:         03:28:31       I don't know. Public domain, if it's like video, I guess it depends on who filmed that. Like if it's as a TV station filmed it, it's there. It's, but if it's like the government filming it, I don't know for sure. Like, I don't know. You've seen video of it. Yeah, there's definitely video footage and it's on it. There's a documentary right now called dying to know, which is an amazing movie about, um, Ron doss and Timothy leary's friendship and it sort of follows the scope of their lives together. It's amazing. It's fucking, well, well shot, but it's real, but it's, it's on there. I'm surprised it's not. Um, not anyways,

Speaker 5:          03:29:13       before I forget this again, this is another thing they want to talk about earlier. When you know the Fermi paradox, what were all the aliens if civilization. So likely yes. Do you think looking at all this virtual reality, and this is something I explored, I did a single podcast the other day with just me answering questions and somebody asks about the Fermi paradox and it really made me think about it even more and I've been thinking about it since then. Do you think it's possible that civilizations never get to travel through space because they get to this thing, they realize that the real juice is in virtual? Like why do you have to like physically Trev traverse between one galaxy to another when you could figure out a way through technology and ultimately through artificial intelligence creating infinitely more complex artificial reality that we're going to never travel, all of our travel is going to be done internally.

Speaker 10:         03:30:02       Well, yeah, I do. I think that that that is a great response to the Fermi paradox. And I think that um, w w our addiction to the idea that we are our body is going to be something that fades away over time and that we stop having this concept that I'm localized in my, that my visit there. You know, we live in a world where people believe that all they are is their body. They think I am my physical body. That's it. That's what I am. That's the sum total of meat inside, outside, inside, body, outside, everything else. Even though what we were talking about earlier, we know that we're inextricably woven in to the fabric of every single thing. So really your body is one part of the infinite universe and right now you have become completely fixated on it. You think it's you.

Speaker 10:         03:30:54       So vr, you put vr on first thing that happens, which is one of my favorite things is you'll hold your, you'll hold your hand up in front of your face, right? And if you have the htc vive, you'll see their amazing controllers is floating in the air. But then you'll look down. There's no fucking body there, man. You're looking down and it's just a blank space. You don't have a body anymore. Now when someone touches you in Vr, it's really fucking cool because you don't see him. It's like a ghost is touching you, and I'm not saying I've done this, but if you were to have sex in Vr, you've done it. Never Joe, have you done? We'll never have sex out of wedlock. But if you were to have sex in Vr, then suddenly you don't have a body anymore. Okay, but you're having sex in vr with another person. Who's your vr with another person?

Speaker 5:          03:31:45       Physical sex with someone. And what do you see on the other side?

Speaker 10:         03:31:48       It depends on what you decided to be having sex.

Speaker 5:          03:31:50       And so you could, you get up sex with your girlfriend and pretend it's like the cookie monster.

Speaker 10:         03:31:56       You could have sex with your girlfriend and just be laying a on in some field looking up at the stars.

Speaker 5:          03:32:02       Cookie Monster's feet up in the air like bugs bunny and you're banging in the ass.

Speaker 10:         03:32:06       Here's what's weird, man. This is what's really weird and no one understands it. But with Vr, apparently people have tried it for some reason they can't do that. There's no way to bring the cookie monster to fuck the cookie monster. Put a man on the moon. We could fuck the cookie monster. Absolutely man, you could. You could do that. You could definitely do that. But, but it's, it's kind of like something about the philosophical implications of not having a body. Even if it's being induced by technology. I'm sure you've taken a high enough dose of something where you merge into the universe and you feel like you don't have a self anymore. You should. It become, so to imagine being able to induce that with Vr so that now you've removed the thing that you've been identifying with your entire life. Your body is yourself and there's just a blank space. Yet consciousness remains. Even though you know you have a body under, when you take the goggles off, you know it's there. As time passes, when you're wearing this shit, you begin to forget about there. You're going to forget about the external world. And, and when you finally do take the goggles off, it's like, oh, oh fuck, oh right, this is my office. This is, it's the same

Speaker 5:          03:33:19       thing that happens in some ways when you get in a tank, when you're in the tank with no vr technology, you sometimes have experiences where you go into like a dream state and you think things are happening that aren't really happening and then you wake up out of them and you're in the tank, right. And they happen in a crazy, vivid way. You don't have any sensory input. You're not, you're not feeling that. Like if you have a dream, you're still feeling the bed most of the time. Like you're out of that stage and you're in this dream dimension. But if for some reason you moved a little bit and you hit your pillow or your, your foot touch the nightstand or something like that, you're going to snap out of it. We ain't that God damn tank. You don't feel anything. Yeah. You're flying through space already. That's it. So you can almost like use that as a homemade virtual reality thing. Absolutely. But the ability to program is where things get squirrely. Yeah. The ability to create any sort of scenario you would like.

Speaker 10:         03:34:17       Yeah. It's the best. It's going to have so many therapeutic uses. What haptic feedback. Yeah, man, it's big. It's, it's like haptic. So like, you know, one impossible end result could be full bodied haptic suits in float tanks in the float tank can go just came. Well yeah, it's, it's one, it's one of the potential uses of the thing. I mean fuck yeah. All the, there's just so much like just there's just so much it's going to be able to, it's going to have, I mean, one thing I really hope people do is, um, and I was thinking about doing this man, but like I always think about doing things like this, I never do it. So maybe one of you guys out there, I'll do it as like bringing this shit old senior citizens homes and letting people who haven't experienced it who are maybe like not going to be in this dimension much longer, have a chance to like Susan if you see what's going on because I think that'd be a great service for people.

Speaker 10:         03:35:12       People who are like, uh, paraplegics and hospitals to bring this technology to them and to let them experience, you know, the freedom for a little while if they can find that their hospital rooms when you, there's so many weirdly anti vr people, man, even counting them. I haven't seen anybody, dude. I was at, uh, well, you know, people are like, Ugh, vr. I've already heard that. Like, you know, it's gonna. It's gonna. It's like a, it's like three d tv, that kind of shit. People have new students to this. Just some Dick at a party. There's no point talking about it. I was trying to impress a girl. There was no girl around maybe trying to fuck you. I fucked him. Okay. Did you take your three year old is really big. You should nagging me. But he was trying to like, yeah, he's probably uh, trying to uh, prod you or he didn't like the fact you're smarter than him.

Speaker 10:         03:36:03       It's, I don't know if I was, but I'll tell you, it's going to be, it's going to be one of the most powerful therapeutic tools, uh, that that's ever existed. Just what it, what it's going to be able to do just for like, you know, you hear about, there was a great, I think it was a vice article, I can't remember which article about a guy who has to program the music that people listen to during the mushroom, uh, studies that they're doing. Like what playlist do you play for someone who's undergoing psychedelic therapy? Right? But for this tool, for psychedelic therapy, like the ability to, there's a program, Oh my God, when you come over, I can't wait to show you this. It's called sound self sound self. And what it is is you put these goggles on and headphones that have a microphone on and you chant into the thing, right? So you're like, oh, and it's true. It takes, that's it. I mean, again, this stuff is, it takes that responds to your sounds are making and then plays it back through your headphones. So you're hear your voice being transformed and replaced is like deeper or lower. It's just very psychedelic

Speaker 5:          03:37:18       and you're watching the images while you're hearing your voice that's being altered. It's like you're doing rounds. How many people are going to be saying that? What's this guy's video? So we could get them some views. What does it say? OCULUS rift games. Sound self virtual reality. Guinea pigs.

Speaker 10:         03:37:39       Yeah. It's so cool. God Damn. And that's something if you, if you guys out there, I haven't, oh my God, look at that.

Speaker 5:          03:37:47       Well, let's just, yeah, let's explain where we were watching were watching as these crazy three dimensional computer animations that look like they look like psychedelic trips. It looks like almost like a gate, whatnot, dmt itself, but like a gateway to dmt. Like right before you blow through. Like there's a moment, there's a moment where you see like what I think what they described as the flower of life before you blast on through to the other side.

Speaker 10:         03:38:14       Now, uh, for those of you have an htc vive, if you want to use this game, uh, you can, you can pay for the alpha. It's 30 bucks cause goggles with the eyeballs and then you've got to use something called the revive injector to get it to run. Anyone who has a five out there, I'll know what I'm talking about cause like

Speaker 5:          03:38:33       what is the difference between a, sorry to interrupt you but what does it different sheen, oculus rift and the vive.

Speaker 10:         03:38:37       So unfortunately oculus has created, has made a bunch of deals with the developers to make exclusive content for the Oculus. Right. And oculus is great, it's really cool. But that was Oculus Oculus, but it's not as good as the vibe for a few different reasons. Uh, one of the reasons is the vive is designed for being able to walk around. The vibe comes with these and maybe the rift you can do it but it seems like it's more localized. But the Mo and I said, forgive me by the way, Oculus rift people, I love you, carmax. Coming on soon. I had the dk one, I had the dk two, you know John Carmack from again software. He's, he's an oculus rift now. Oculus is great and, and God bless you guys for making vr possible because they were the ones of Palmer luckey ran with this fucking torch.

Speaker 10:         03:39:26       He like made this fucking happen. The only problem is the oculus released without controllers like vive has. Right. And that was a big mistake. So the boxing thing that we saw, that was vibe, that was five, but oculus is releasing controllers now. And honestly, now that I'm getting so sucked into Vr, I've actually considered buying an oculus rift just so I have both. But you don't Christ, dude, you're deep. You don't really need it because you can, um, use a something called revive, which allows you to play Oculus Games on the HTC vive. You're so deep in this man. It's weird to see. It's the coolest fucking thing. Just says this is the same. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          03:40:02       Dock. And that was terrified of everquest and world of warcraft and all that other shit that you got sucked into. You're not terrified of this. You're a, you're just a whole hog diving right in here. It feels right.

Speaker 6:          03:40:19       I love that expression.

Speaker 10:         03:40:20       It feels like the right thing. It feels like, and it's cool. I'll tell you, man, by the way, there's not a lot of people right now who have vr gear and there's just some kind of like exciting thing about same floor ground floor and being like, oh my God, this is going to change the world.

Speaker 5:          03:40:38       Let's do a podcast. I'm from your place. Let's do your podcast does. Friday, Doug and I are doing the Ice House in Pasadena on Friday night. We're doing the eight o'clock show. Sold out. Sorry. Um, but we're going to do, we'll do a podcast from your house and we'll do it with me experiencing your vr for the first time and we'll keep barbecued. I will try to things we were so high before the show. I was worried if I was going to be able to pull it.

Speaker 10:         03:41:02       Man, that breath spray paint,

Speaker 6:          03:41:04       playing around. I was worried.

Speaker 5:          03:41:08       I was worried. I was like, oh no. I went, God, I don't know if I can handle this one dude. I did a podcast with Sam Harris and I took 12 shots of the breast spray for the podcast. I wanted to see what would happen. And I kept going. And halfway to the podcast I was like, oh my God. It was like I was skiing down a hill. Like on, I was on a black diamond ski course. I was, I was up and I was moving and I was conscious and I knew just keep, just keep paying attention to the road. Liz left and right and left and right. You're gonna, you're gonna make it, you're going to make it. You don't make it. Where do you get Jambo from? Don't say the name out loud. Yeah. Yeah. It's a girl has no name. I'm sorry, girl has no name. She doesn't, but I don't want to say it three times. Like candy man in front of the mirror.

Speaker 6:          03:41:55       We'll talk

Speaker 5:          03:42:00       Friday night. You mother fuckers. So, uh, we'll be doing an episode of the Duncan trussell family hour chat with the Ice House upon my pleasure, my brother. I'll always love doing these. We need to do these more often. You know, we're really good friends, but we see each other and getting it, get deeper with each other during these podcasts than we ever do in real life now. Because if we, in real life, we would be talking to other people. We'd be looking at our phone, we'd be doing some other shit now

Speaker 10:         03:42:26       eating. I love these moments, Joe. There are some of the happiest moments in my life, so, so grateful you let

Speaker 5:          03:42:32       me be on the show. If I'm grateful that you're on it, man. But what I wanted to say was, it's, it's, it's a fascinating thing because I never would have imagined that we would get to know each other better and deeper and more intensely by doing podcasts together with a whole world could hear it. I mean, you and I have had some crazy fucking conversations alone in private with just, you and I are just talk to you about stuff for hours and hours, but there's something crazy about doing these like this, and we're doing our live and then we put them out there. They're, they're fascinating, man. We got to do it more often. Uh, all right, we'll be back tomorrow with a Wayne Fetterman, my friend Wayne Fetterman. Very funny. Standup comic. Neal Brennan's coming. Uh, it's, it looked like it was going to be Gary Johnson and Stan hope on Thursday, but it, Gary Johnson might have to pull out. He got to fly into Wednesday. He's doing a town hall meeting on CNN, which is big news because he's a third party candidate. That's what happens. People get sick of the two parties. All right. But, uh, we'll be back soon. See Ya.

Speaker 6:          03:43:32       Bye. Bye.

Speaker 14:         03:43:46       Yeah.
