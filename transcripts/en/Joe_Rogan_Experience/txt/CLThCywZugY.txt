Speaker 1:          00:05          I am one of the directors of science and my specialty is communications and the idea that a mission ends when you return to the data, when you make the discoveries, when the scientists publish their papers, to me the mission doesn't end until you have some sort of public involvement until you have some sort of public buyin. I think that's as important as any other part of the mission you had been trying to tell people for years that our communications team on a mission is just like having your crack team of electrical engineers or your or your best computer programmers. You need to have people that really understand communication as well. Uh, it, it helps. I mean, in my case, I started out as a research astrophysicist and so I understand a lot of the topics as well, but I do communications now a NASA and as far as why NASA is important, I think this is one of these things that people have no idea.

Speaker 1:          00:51          We run at the moment, 108 science missions. Those are mostly spacecraft. Some of them are on balloons or sounding rockets or on the space station. Uh, some of them are on the earth. We have people embedded with the, uh, the Zombie reindeer herders, trying to understand how climate change is changing the migration of reindeer herds. I mean, it's, it's amazing that NASA is all over and, you know, everything from the disaster mitigation from all of those hurricanes. We actually sent staff to Puerto Rico when Fema was overwhelmed. They've been setting up communication centers. Um, I mean everything from determining what set off the big bang to, you know, where are those wildfires going to be spreading to in southern California. We have 108 missions and I've never seen any organization operate more efficiently. I've never worked with more brilliant people. Um, I think people often don't understand what the real value is as far as blue sky research.

Speaker 1:          01:46          You know, people talk about spinoffs and people joke about things like velcro and Tang. I mean, those are jokes, but the, uh, the more intelligent people might notice things like, you know, microprocessors started at NASA cell phones, the reason you have computers, the reason the United States was poised to lead the computer revolution was because of the Apollo program. But, um, I don't know. I mean all of those kind of fall flat to tell you the truth, I think that people don't understand. It was a, a NASA satellite doing research just out of curiosity to see what gases in the atmosphere that discovered that the ozone hole is being depleted in the 19 eighties. And uh, the NASA scientists with a number of university scientists went running to the UN instead. If we don't do something, we are literally going to destroy the planet. And they made the Montreal.

Speaker 1:          02:31          They actually got the Montreal protocol sign. They actually make treaties, the other band, these chemicals that we're depleting our ozone layer. And we've since done an atmospheric models that show that we would have actually destroyed the ozone layer. Had we done nothing by the year 20, 60, which if not in my lifetime is probably in our children's lifetime. And um, basically that would have destroyed agriculture. Crops would've failed all over the world. You couldn't have livestock outside. People couldn't have lived outside. Um, we very nearly destroyed civilization and your grandchildren would have lived through that. And so when people talk about what's the best NASA spinoff, you know, the worth of blue sky research that you don't understand where it's going to lead best friend, if I know this grandchildren.
