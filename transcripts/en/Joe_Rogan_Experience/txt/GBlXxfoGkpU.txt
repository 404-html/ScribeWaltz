Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Two, one end. We're live. Justin ran. How are you sir? I'm great. It's going on brother, man. I'm excited to be back here. And they're kicking ass digging wells. All of the above trying fights. Have you had now back in Beltour? Only a two to uh, but I haven't been back since the first or second one. So this is what you are. Yeah. You were here before your first one, which was a, you had a long break for five years and two months and I hadn't even really trained any at that point. Like I was. I was just doing the wells and going to Congo and then uh, got back into fighting and only had a little bit of time to train, but it's, it was uh, it was okay. But this time, do you have it for your first fight? I think actually whenever I was here with you, I uh, I, I fibbed a little where I said, uh, it was a little longer because I didn't know if my opponent was going to watch her or whatever, but uh, my, my fight camp got cut in half.

Speaker 1:          00:01:00       Um, I was traveling, traveling, traveling, the book was getting ready to come out and other stuff and try and write the book and prepare and trying to figure all that out where were just talking before we got on and about just life stuff and scheduling it and everything and they had the book and then Congo and then telling people about it and then also training for a fight and I didn't know how to balance those real well. But, uh, I play in 12 weeks, all of a sudden, Congo corruption took me to Congo for, for three weeks at the beginning, so we cut it down to nine weeks and then whenever I got back or while I was there, I found out they were moving the fight up on me three weeks. Um, and so it cut my camp down to about six, seven weeks.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       So six, seven weeks after being off for more than five years. Yeah. And I had trained a few times before that, uh, I mean like within the few months before, but um, but I, I think it was probably tops two months, a nine weeks. We'll pause. Weren't you just like, just getting over malaria? Yeah, and I was, uh, that's, that's the tough stuff. That's a tougher in the fight. I feel like. Fuck man, we have one of our guys in Congress that's got, had malaria, one of our jewelers I just recently got real sick and it's kind of like constantly, it's just part of life there, Jesus. And it doesn't matter what kind of medication you take before you go out there. And I was actually taking a. actually our director at water four was taking, um, malarone. It's like the best anti-malaria pill. I think it's something like seven, $8 every pill.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       So, uh, it's, it's the creme de la creme of Larry meds and it didn't work on him and I was actually going into Congo actually. I stopped in London, did one of those Ted talks at a university called Warwick University. And the day of the talk I was at a 100, three degree temperature, one to three point two. And um, and I thought it was pulling out. They thought it was pulling out. We were at the hospital for four or five, six hours. Um, oh, and dude, even the opportunity to go speak at that is because their team was all fans of jre. Wow. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah, that was the opportunity gap because of, because of this. And man it was, it was, uh, it was tough during the talk. And then, um, whenever I got into Congo they told me I had the flu in London and the doctors there and that's what I feel like here to.

Speaker 1:          00:03:18       There can be tropical medical medicine specialist here and they're probably really great. But I would trust a doctor that's lived in the climate, the tropical climate around malaria that seen it, that knows all the symptoms, well knows to look for it because no one gets it over here. Yeah. And so whenever I got into Congo, I flew from, yeah, from work to Congo in whenever I landed, instead of going straight to the forest, uh, they took me to like a air strip at a hospital in the middle of nowhere. Um, so I landed, went straight to the hospital and then right there they're like, you don't have the flu, you have malaria. And I'm like, but I, I've been, I've been in the states, I just fought and then I have a in Europe, like there's no normal area really there, but it was because it's still living inside me.

Speaker 1:          00:04:02       There's like, um, I think there's three strands. One live in your body for three years, five years. I think the other is like 30 to life or something. Yeah. And so it just comes back. Yeah, it can. Like when your body's really rundown, when you're really tired, immune system's low, like training for a fight, like training for a fight or right after the fight. Uh, right off the fight. Went to London, spoke, then I went to Congo. But right after the fight. So you were recovering from malaria. You go through your six week fight camp, you have your fight, your rundown. And then after the fight you got malaria again? Yes. Now the sickness. I've had it now three times. Oh my kids. So at least confirmed twice. The third time they're like, yeah, you have it for sure. But they, you with malaria, you have to get the test, the blood test while you have a certain degree, temperature fever, uh, whenever it's cycling out of your liver and coming out, they have to draw the blood at that exact time to get it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       And so that's why I was misdiagnosed four times in the Congo and um, what a sneaky fucking disease. Yeah, it's nuts. It's crazy because they'll, they'll hide in your liver and then they send them out in your bloodstream, like a, like a platoon. They go and wreck havoc and then they retreat right back to the liver. Really? They live in your liver? Yeah. That's where they're hiding away for three or five or 30 years. Oh my God. And what does, is there any solution? Is there anything they could do? Um, I don't think so. And I had a couple of things that happened where, um, you know, I started trying to take the anti malaria meds, but I started getting, it's the only medicine I've ever really reacted to where get nauseous, start dragging it. It's awful. Yeah. Even, uh, even um, oh, I'm pasty white and I get real sun sensitive.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       I know another medicine called [inaudible], which is a think it's developed in Switzerland or Sweden, supposed to be an awesome new malaria medicine. It's actually the one thing my body kind of responds to, but um, but it's actually really dangerous because a, I've seen people that are there for aid work and different stuff. And do they have to, they have to retreat if they're there with kids and stuff. They moved there to the country they're taking off because um, cause kiddos or even adults have mental breaks that they can't come back from. Like you can have psychotic episodes for. I think they said like if it lasts longer than a week, it's probably in the last like three months. It will last longer than three months. It's probably the last forever. Wow. Yeah. So, um, so this is from the medication? Yeah, it's just the medication and it gives you terrible, terrible nightmares.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       I almost went to Tanzania this summer. What was going to go on Safari? And too many people scare the shit out of me with malaria talk. Yeah, I was going to take my whole family and I'm like, look, I'll take some millennial malaria medication and feel like shit, I'm not giving it to my six year old is not happening. That would be. I'm not doing enough when you. Yeah, but that's a real concern. Right? Tanzania has malaria as well, right? Yeah, they do it because it's more of a, an arid climate and we're, it's, they have less there. It's not so tropical there. I've been to Tennessee a couple times and seeing the bar, I mean it's just um, I met wasn't there, but I was saw it and it was a, I don't know, man. It's, it's a crazy, crazy place because you go from Congo where they have all these tropical diseases and you go same continent, you just go over a little bit and there's all these other kinds of parasites in Congo there you have very little of a, I believe they're called jiggers with aj and I'm very careful when you say that word, but jiggers with aj I'm wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:07:34       It sounds like you should stop, but they're these crazy parasites at borough in your feet and especially kids and elderly. Um, and especially kids and elderly. Um, well honestly, I think one reason with poverty, the kids don't get shoes until they can work in biome and uh, the elderly, if they're not able to work and provide for themselves and you know, it's harder for them to, to, to get shoes and stuff, but also it's just where they live because on the sandy or it's either sandy or the clash or silty soil that's real red and Uganda, man. It just wreaks havoc on those kids to where they're having to have people come in every week to different villages, sit there with a safety pins and all sorts of these little hooks that they dig into people's feeds. And um, Oh God, dude, it's, it's painful. Whenever I've seen people getting it done, they're literally putting their.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       And I've had one in my foot and it kind of came and gone. It's not that bad when it's just one, but whenever your whole foot or your whole heel or all the, you know, the balls of your feet are just covered in. I mean, I'm talking 20, 30, 40, 50 of these parasites. They're just brutal. So every step you see them when they're walking, they're grimacing. When you're taking it out there screaming. God Damn Africa. Africa is just, it's such a strange, strange continent, but me and the people are, are beautiful in their hearts. You know, they're awesome. They're a half her probably more than half. If you're not a good one, you're very terrible. Yeah, that's simple. Obviously from the outside, that's what it looks like. Someone like me who tries to pay attention as much as I can, but there's only so much you could actually know about it without being there, I think, right?

Speaker 1:          00:09:22       Yeah, I think so. I think whenever you get there, I don't know, fall in love with the people and to build up the relationships. That's why you can see past all the garbage, all the discomfort. You said that you were held up with corruption, Congo corruption. What happened? So they, they called me and said, um, my team, uh, is Astrid Papa. Papa y is like a father figure to me. He's the one that had this vision. I came alongside him and it's just been, it's been awesome to see what's happened in um, whenever I went to him. Actually. What, what was the question? You're just asking. I don't even remember what I say. I said about the corruption corruption there. Yeah, yeah. He called me and said a fat you to get back here and like three weeks and I'm like, what? I'm training for the fight, like it's coming up and I can't leave.

Speaker 1:          00:10:14       No, he says if you don't come back. No. Like I don't know when you can come back, they'll, they're going to revoke your visa. They're going to. And I'm like, what for? And so they said, check your passport. They said your visa is expiring in three weeks. And I'm like, it should be expiring. I have a five year visa, but then you have to come in and out of the country every 11 months because if you don't, you lose that five year visa. And so whenever I left with my wife, literally they just so that they can get money out of us and steel and build, asked for 1400, sometimes $2,500 to get a visa like this. Um, you know, they, they write down on your visa when they stamp it, the date they write it in. And so now I know, look, every single time they're writing to make sure they write the right date because she backdated it like six months or something like that, or maybe nine months and then all of a sudden I had to get back there because they're like, nope, it's gonna expire.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       And they thought they gave him. Actually it might've been less than three weeks. I think it had to go for three weeks is what happened because I like a week notice I just took off when it's actually the cheapest trip I've ever got there because it was like the last seat I was by the toilets in the back the whole time. But there's only $800 round trip, which was incredible. That's pretty crazy. You can go to Africa for 800 bucks. Yeah, that was, I never seen it like that, but it was a good school. So I went and I mean it helped because that saved me some money that was going to have to pay to try to get out of the corruption and stuff. But luckily we went there, they didn't think I would just dropping, you know, be there in five, six, seven days.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       So I took off, went and we spent three weeks trying to just negotiate with the courts and everything else and say, look, this is, you guys did this, you sent me an up all this other stuff and trying to prove them wrong. They're never wrong, you know, they're always right. And uh, trying to show them even receipts and pictures, we were showing them pictures from Ben's wedding. He's like my best friend, like a brother, a translator for me. He's our team leader and I'm literally, we're showing pictures of me at his wedding and luckily it was dated and everything, like I was here in the country when you said I had already left for five months before. So, um, it's just not, it's like the backdating is intentional to do it. I'll do it on purpose. So that for me and my wife, both, they, uh, they made it the same date which was like six months or eight months early.

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       I'm like, we left earlier than what we did. So from the outside, when you're visiting them, did they, do they think somehow or another that you're wealthy and that they can take advantage of you? They know, they know you're on television, do they know all that? No, no, we keep that really kind of when I'm, there I am a, let me see if I can get the right. I am a professor of appropriate technologies that appropriate technologies or like a community development or sustainable solutions and I go there and I'm teaching the students at the university how to, uh, and only I only do like a week or two seminar with them. The rest of them with my well drilling team and that's my covering. I go there as a quote unquote a professor commission give that up on the Internet. Yeah, I'm even people.

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       No, no, no. It's okay. But I do that because, you know, when I go in and really it's not because I'm on TV or anything like that or they think I have money, they just think anyone that's not Congolese has money. And so because that's what they've seen from people coming in and throwing money around. So they want their. Yeah, in a lot of the ngos are like, they, they have quotas and everything else and the other just a huge budget and they got to spend it. They got to meet those, those quotas. So sometimes they throw it around and they're not, they're not trying to be frugal with the money because it's not theirs. They didn't go out and get it or fundraising or get a grant for it or anything like that. It just got to spend. So they'll just give it away.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       Do the people that live in the Congo, like the, the pygmies, do they still get malaria? Is it really common with them yet? We're really common. Um, but it's, it's, um, it's weird because whenever people come, I guess they're more acclimated to it, but it still kills so many. Um, and then, but whenever I get it, they're, they're saying, you know, the doctor here told me because of the malaria meds, it would be better for you to go because you're already getting sick, too sick with medicine, just go get malaria and then get it diagnosed quick enough, get the cure and now your body's actually gonna adapt to it and the next time you get it will be less and less women. So they told you to get malaria. Fucking Christ one of the worst diseases person can get. Right? Yeah. But honestly I've seen people, even even Ben Ben's nuts, like the year that I was there, he had malaria, now it's almost killed them before too, but he had malaria like three or four times in a year.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       And um, and it just kind of really, really common there. But once you, if you can survive it the first couple times, then they say after that it gets more bearable because you feel it coming. You feel the heat waves coming over you. And then you fill the shoulder joint pains and elbows and it just down your whole spine and your finger joints are just throbbing, like you can feel your pulse. So it's an inflammation disease. Uh, it's a blood parasite disease and had just a. But it causes some inflammation. The parasite somehow or another does that to your joints. Yeah. And it released causes a lot of pain. I know that. And it, uh, it was, it. I lost 33 pounds, five days. Um, Jesus Christ, 33 pounds in five days. Thirty three pounds. Dr Oz, Dr. Oz would sell that I could. I could be in here.

Speaker 1:          00:15:50       I got a new, a la diet for he can he really do the Congo Diet? Really hot, too hot. So that's a massive sacrifice. You're willing to take time to do that. And this, the fact that it's, it exists inside your body for an undetermined stated time. That's um, that's pretty wild, man. It's, it's scary. Um, yeah. Honestly, I feel like I was in a much scarier place personally before, before I found this before I found them before I got given a second family or accepted into a second family and even more scarier because you were depressed because you just will depress suicidal thoughts. I had for like 10 years, just battled it from 13 years old, 23. And so, um, so yeah, that, that was a lot scarier to me than suicidal thoughts when you're 13. Yeah, for sure. And I mean I was, I was the one that like, you know, the kid in the, in the class that, I mean I wasn't, I wasn't like, I wouldn't say I was, how do I say it?

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       It was extremely brutal, but it was happening to. I mean everyone gets bullied for the most part. Somebody is bullying you. Yeah. Well, when I was growing up that from, from third grade until eighth grade for sure, it was brutal. Seventh and he throws me usually smaller than I was like, dude, I was smaller. It takes a lot of balls to bully you and a backfire. It's actually kind of why I found fighting or net, why it is kind. It is because a, I was 13 years old and I had just gotten so well. Two things. Have you ever seen in Texas for high school homecomings? They have mums. Have you heard of that? Now it's a mom fixes tradition. That's crazy. Now. All, all, all the kids love them. Everything else. But you get these corsages or fake flowers that they put real big up top and then they are streamers with literal bells and whistles, full sized teddy bears.

Speaker 1:          00:17:55       You can have two, three teddy bears and when I was in high school, the girl would wear it on her, her shoulder and the weird around his arm. Now in Texas, they literally have to put a harness around him and hold these things up because they're so big and there you go. Texas my fuck that. That's homecoming in Texas. Why? Look at that? I'm telling you, it's the whole state, the whole state. I mean every, every homecoming that comes around tech Texans are nuts about this. I mean, I lived in Texas and I was like four months old, so it was a. they're nuts and they've gotten bigger and bigger and bigger every single year and a. How am I just hearing about the proud of it? It's weird. I mean just hearing about this Jamie. I think those are literally like two and $300. No. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       When I was in high school, they're like 7,100. Oh my God. Look at all those girls. Look at that picture that you had done there. There's giant group of girls with all this. This is ridiculous. That not nuts. How do you. How do you go to the dance like that? How do you go to the game like that? I don't understand. Literally the boyfriends are walking behind him holding the stuff up for him because why aren't the. It's getting too heavy or their neck hurts, but they want to wear it. It's a tradition. Yeah. Everybody gets excited. The bigger and the bigger the mom, the better. The more, the more your date to you. Is this a mom company that you just clicked on every single grocery store in Texas? Why? Whenever it comes to like a September, October, November, around homecoming time, high school. Like this is people's jobs, like seasonal jobs.

Speaker 1:          00:19:21       He sit around and they take special orders. They make them for you or they sound where he can make them yourself. That's so strange. Isn't it? Nuts? How many is this? It always baffles me when I find out about something for the very first time. I don't know why I'm so confused by it. I would like to find out where the traditional, uh, came from probably. But I mean people are just so ingrained in you. If you're texting that you have to get moms. And so, uh, is there any other students find out if other states except that I literally, Oklahoma doesn't do it. Louisiana doesn't. New Mexico, Texas, twelfth things. Non Texas. Need to know about homecoming moms.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       What in the fuck your mom started as a simple flower. Hold on, scroll up a little bit. Mum started as a simple flower. Guys give them to their homecoming date. Oh, that's hilarious. Girls also give guys one called a garter, like a gardener. Other you put it on your on your arm or garter belt or over here side. How busy. Like one of those things that tie boxer. Yeah. Being able to make moms can make you rich. Oh God. See? Sixty to $300. $300 for fake flowers on her bucks. It ain't cheap to electrify a mom. Oh my God. That's so crazy. You can put led lighting. Look at that. Scroll up, scroll up a little bit, but you can put led lighting and moms. I didn't know how many are doing this back when I was in high school, but nowadays you really want to impress your date. The latest and mum lighting technology will help you do just that. That is hilarious. You know, this isn't even like a juke website right now. They're taking it serious, real serious, strange [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:21:04       It's really weird. And so when I was in middle school, seventh grade, I got a Christmas tree on her tits. That's ridiculous. They uh, uh, so you want to save? I saved it up and my allowance asked one of my crushes to go to the homecoming game with me. She said yes to my surprise, went to the game and uh, spent pretty much all my allowance on a, the her mom and uh, her name's Jessica and I took her to the game and uh, I'm up in the stands with her and home or halftime comes around. I'm up to the very top left and all of a sudden everyone looks back up over the right shoulders at us. And this one guy, he was Kinda my, my belief through elementary and middle school for sure. And um, his name was justin as well. And so he walks up and puts his arm out to her and she puts her arm around his and he grabs the streamer that says, uh, Justin and Jessica and the year on it or whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       And uh, he says, thanks for getting her this. And I'm like, what? And he goes, you didn't think she'd come with you, did you? And so he just kind of walks down all the schools looking. They're all laughing and having fun. But, and, and that one hurt, but what was worse with the next year, because, you know, people liked that part of, I don't know, I think for me, when I see bullying now, I just spoke at a middle school and I told one of the teachers asked, what should you tell a kid that's battling with suicidal thoughts or depression even, maybe suicidal thoughts. And I'm like, well, if this is 300, 400 kids in here, like for sure one person is dealing with these issues right now. And I would say, you know, the thing that probably saved me was my parents didn't own a gun.

Speaker 1:          00:22:54       I'd probably only Texans that don't own guns. And uh, then, um, I don't know. I mean, I guess one of the main things was um, well I don't even know that I've ever said this publicly, but I remember, um, having attempted suicide once and then I'm thinking about it again and then I'm thinking, you know, what would this, what would the student, my mom, you know. And so I love my mom. I'm a mama's boy. Dad's great too. But that's just who I am. She's a tough cookie. She's where I got my competitiveness. She was a national champion in barrel racing, state champion in tennis. And so she always pushed me, my dad, if he, uh, if he was at a wrestling tournament and it's the finals even state, I would dislocate my thumb or something to come up. You don't have to wrestle in the next match.

Speaker 1:          00:23:41       Like it's the finals. My Mom's like, he's getting out there. So my mom, mom's the one pushing him, shut up, Jimmy, he's going gonna he's going to go out there and he's going to wrestle him. He's going to win. And so my dad was more of one wanting to protect me and she's the one who pushed me out there. Um, so I guess, uh, saying that except for, oh, that thought was just ringing in my head. And so whenever I finally verbalized that and start talking to people, that's what really helped, you know, it didn't have to be a bunch of people that didn't have to go around and be, um, I don't know, a drama queen or do it for attention or whatever, but just find one person and for me at that age it was having a great mom and um, parents that loved me and I think that's probably absolutely what saved me at that time.

Speaker 1:          00:24:26       And so I was telling these kids, you know, hey, tell if even if it's just your mom. So I was taking pictures with some of the kids afterwards and stuff and I'll walk out to leave and I'm in the hall in this mom stops me because she's with her little guy and he's crying. So a mom had come to school. I had heard there was anti anti-bullying doc. She came up and I see this little guy, he reminded me, a lot of me, the only difference was, uh, was he had these kind of big glasses on, but he was a little chubby and had just had one of those things that you'd see stereotypical, like this kid's going to get picked on. And so I'm probably a lot like me. He's used to getting his fat pinch tune, nipples twisted and you know, all that different stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       And so, um, he was out there just balling with his mom. His mom asked if I can talk to him for a little bit. I did and she was saying that he had never opened up with her and uh, in the last two years, but she knew he had been dealing with really bad depression and right there he told her, I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts for two years. And so I don't know why I even brought that up except for like, it's nuts. My parents have a, have a photography company and they made a memorial a few years back for a little boy who was getting bullied. Didn't think he had an option out and he took his life at nine years old. Oh my goodness. Well, I think it was a swing set out back. So I'm like, oh Jesus Christ. And so, um, I saw the plaque and everything made up for them and just gut wrenching.

Speaker 1:          00:25:53       And so as I say that in the first story wasn't kind of one that kind of brought everything to a head was I was in middle eighth grade this time, um, got invited to a Jennifer's birthday party. Really excited. I got one of the real limitations in my hands and made the plans talk to my mom, asked if I could go talk to some of the people who else is going. That was just kind of a Dorky kid anyways. But, um, uh, on the invitation I noticed, man, it says costume contest and the winner gets a prize. Why certain research, all this other stuff, other people are doing it too. And um, I found out that her dad worked at Dr Pepper in that their house was decorated with all this other stuff. And then, um, and then she loved transformers. And so I thought, what if I combine two things, what if I could meet myself a cardboard transformer from head to toe?

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       I think it was a 24 pack or only had 12 packs around the arms, legs, boots I had. I had a chest plate at a sword out of cardboard, a country kid texted you see those moms, we can do pretty much anything with duct tape. And uh, so duct tape, cardboard just made it up and walked into the party. And um, her grandma opened the door. She goes, oh, Jennifer's going to love this. Walked into. They literally had a Dr Pepper machine where it was like old school ones you didn't have to pay, just push the button. It pops out. Thirteen year old kid. He loved that. So we had dr pepper can one end of the Dr Pepper Cardboard Sword in the other walk to the backyard when whenever the door opens, I opened the door and breathe there with like some flashes of lights and fingers pointing, people laughing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       And um, I remember Jennifer saying, can't believe you thought you were cool enough to come to my party. And I was the only one that was dressed up. Everybody else had gotten there early and they all been planning and even the invitations are fake just so that I would come there and dress up. Another kid said, I'm, you're worthless. So in that moment I felt worthless. And then, um, the main bully said you should just kill yourself. And so whenever he said that, 13 years old battle with depression and suicidal thoughts, all that different stuff minute, it took me on a downward spiral tailspin. It really sucked. I didn't know how to cover it up. And then I guess I'm getting back to them and may route where I found that 13 years old at like a flea market in the Texas and walking down these aisles and looking for a bb gun and all of a sudden I get to the site, used video shop and it's got UFC vhs.

Speaker 1:          00:28:20       I think it was two through 10 or 10 to 11 or something like that. And, um, so I just let bottom all you were on there and do that as a horrible story, man. That is a terrible story. How the fuck does kids be so mean? I mean that is honestly, I don't think it's, I mean that crazy compared to, I mean it is, it's very like a methodical, like very planned out. I'm in, a lot of people were in on it. I think that probably was one of the things like, honestly Jennifer was that the biggest crush I ever had in, you know, elementary, middle school growing up, you know. And so she was the one that really wanted impressed. That's why I did that research, you know? And then you know, that she was in on it. These other guys planned it, but she went along with it, um, to her to have her say that to you, like the, I can't believe you thought you were cool enough to come to my party.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       Yeah. Fuck man. Yeah. I ended up leaving. Um, and this is before cell phones. I didn't have a cell phone until I was like 16 and 17 and I'm, so I'm 13, run out, found a dairy queen. And, uh, when the back and where the drive through is, there was like a, I don't know, the dumpster and they get like the fence around it and I just was able to open it, sit there and just cried basically until someone came out to throw away the trash. And then they're like, oh, how many got down, what do you need? And all this other stuff. Can you call your mom? I'm like, if I have a phone. And so I walked inside, called her, but she wasn't there. So took a little while to get ahold of my mom. And then, um, yeah, I mean it was just, it was nuts because it's weird how you, you will believe, especially in today's age with social media and all the tweets and things that people just throw away.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       I throw around, um, you know, it's nuts. How can see somebody don't even know them. They might have one follower, but somehow it can still, if you let it, it can still affect you instead of just shrugging it off. That's a totally different thing though. So insanely something on twitter and someone saying something and looking you in the eyes. Yeah. And planning out this big deception. Yeah. But you're such a nice guy. I got to understand what, what the fuck. Cause it's selling to be such a shithead like that. Well, I don't know man. I think, I think um, I've, I've matured a lot where, I mean obviously 20 minutes at 13, but uh, uh, I think I just became an easy target and because you're just a nice guy and they just, maybe I wouldn't stand up for myself and maybe I wasn't the biggest kid, but I was Chubby and bigger and uh, uh, yeah, I think it just was easy to pick on me in the locker rooms, pick on me in the.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       I don't know, I think I think have the stats I was looking at with something like 87 percent of bullying doesn't happen in the presence of adults. Adults. Right. And then, uh, I forget, but you know, even the people around like how you're saying, you know, two people plan it out and everything else look you in the eyes. I think that might've been what took me back the most because I was like, man, like this is if you're sitting by, this is what I tried to tell some of the kiddos growing up now it's like if you think that by laughing at me or if you're there and you're not bullying, but you're giggling, you're laughing, like you're definitely a part of it. You're an encourager, but then if you're, even if you're silent and you're just watching it and you don't like now your.

Speaker 1:          00:31:48       If you see it, you have a choice. You do something bad at your economic. And so I feel like that's a passive standby kind of encouragement where in. So for me it was like everyone was there, people were saying it, people were laughing, people were watching, but nobody was standing up for me. So it was a think that was what hurt the most. We'll see. So there's two giant instances. The one with the other guy named Justin, so they plan that out to fuck man. You went to school with little kids? Yeah, it was actually part of the same kids. So yeah. Damn. Yeah. And then, uh, so from that, um, yeah, that, that's, that's definitely been the biggest battle of my life has been depression, suicidal thoughts, and it was all from that bullying. There was nothing other than that for the depression. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       Yeah. I mean it went from technically I would say I went from third grade to 10th grade and then whenever I started wrestling and my parents transferred me out of the school, everything else then. But the bullying is what caused all these suicidal thoughts. There's nothing else that was bombed you out about life that is so fucked up at some shitty mean kids can all of a sudden throw this monkey wrench in your life. And then I've, I've learned, and I mean, of course you know, a lot. I used to looking back at it, it shouldn't have. I shouldn't have ever let it get to the point to where, you know, I think I should hurt myself or kill me. You know what? Just a real quick put that together with the pygmies and Congo, whenever I opened up and shared with some of them around the campfire, just hanging out, talking, sharing life stories.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       I shared that and I just remember the looks on several people's faces just so baffled. Like did he just say he wanted to hurt himself? You suicide. He wanted to kill himself. I'll let him and stuff and then I start asking me does that not happen here? And they're like, whoa. Some of them were like, well, we've heard of that happening before and yeah, there's, there's this guy that was that guy and that guy and that guy. We heard that someone in their village had hurt themselves or killed themselves or something, but most of the people I think were like, no, I've never heard. Why would anyone. If you hurt yourself, you're only like, it's only hurting you. That's not going to help anything. We just wanted the pain to end. Yeah. Yeah. Here I just wanted the pain to end, but there it's like it's not because they.

Speaker 1:          00:34:10       If, if I look at it as a little kid, I got bullied by something, some stupid kids, and then look at if I look at what they're going through and it makes it, it makes it, it shrinks it, it makes it microscopic. Whenever you stop just focusing on your own problems and you start looking at others, other problems that maybe you can be a part of helping solve that problem. So this bullying all throughout your childhood led into adulthood and the only thing that made it better was you go into the Congo and helping out these pygmies and building wells and, and sort of dedicating and devoting your life to their life. Yeah. I would say practically that has been, you know, to have a sense of purpose. I mean I think it's a, it's a lot of different things, but that all Kinda came together.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       But for me, yeah, I mean when you're not living for yourself and you live in for others, you just want. I mean, I didn't know that for me, I had a big paradigm shift or change in my life. Whenever you know, coming out of the addiction, I felt like, I mean, like I don't have to walk around and hit myself in, stay away from people because they're either going to hurt me or I'm going to want to hurt them. Like, uh, I don't have to do that. I can, I can help people. I can want to love them. I can, you know, figure out something that I did at first started at what really started helping a lot. Was involved with a lot of different stuff from a juvenile detention center. Going in and meeting with some of those kids once a week to a homeless shelter to becoming a official volunteer at the Denver Children's hospital and taking the grudge guys through there.

Speaker 1:          00:35:52       And I think like Rashad and Dwayne and Shane Carlin and Brendan and all these guys, you know, they were going and they actually saw me going through the really tough, uh, addictions and getting kicked off grudge fight team. And then a year later I'm luckily able to organize an event where the. They wouldn't let us come in just as fighters to visit the kids because they were like, fighters, why would you guys come and visit us? And uh, that's violent. And so I decided to become a volunteer here, go through all the processes and the training and all the other stuff. And then I love volunteering there. And then after they got to know me, I'm like, Hey, can we do a team visit us in there? The best visit they had ever had was the bikers. I'm like, this biker gang guys. They always brought pizza on Wednesday night or something.

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       And uh, and they literally did look, look rough and tumble. And um, and then they said ours was a second pass. And I'm like, you know, and they said, well, I won't say the teams, but some of the other, uh, big major league sports, they said those have been any named some of them. And they're like, they've been some of your absolute worst. I'm like, man, see you thought fighters are going to come in here and I don't know if you thought were going to beat up the kids or something. But, but uh, no, we were passionate about the sport. I mean, I think passionate means you love something so much that you'll suffer for it were, or even a suffering looks like enjoyment. Our becomes enjoyment because you love it and you're passionate about it. And so, I mean whenever you're a fighter, you're getting beat up and all the other stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       And we, man, we're, we're passionate people. We really love each other. It's all team come camaraderie and yeah, there's an intense camaraderie between people that train together because you go through such difficult sessions and difficult sparring and difficult moments and conditioning and all that stuff and you push each other and it's a different kind of bond. Right? Yeah. And on that, I think I saw someone recently posted something that was pretty cool where it showed a, like a Jujitsu gentleman. It was, um, showing all the different people and in it it said something like, this is the, where's the one place you will, you can find. It was really just people in these different skin colors. And I forget how it was worded, but yeah. And we all get along and there's all piece. It's like, I love that. Yeah, I do as well. Did you, do you stay in any way in touch with those kids from back in the day from the kids that bullied you? You. It was actually funny after the ultimate fighter, um, I got invited out by one of the guys. Um, and uh, just because I think a couple of people, they'll just, yeah, saw one of the guys who was one of the

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       main guys and he's like, Hey, I'm walking around downtown Fort Worth and say, why don't we go out here? Whatever. I'm like, all right, I'll go. And. Well he had actually brought me into, uh, the Sushi restaurant in all around the table was most of the people that were not most is probably only eight or 10 people, but they were some of the main kids that were at that party when I dressed up and everything. Why? Man, if you, if we'd have known you were a fighter or you know, you could kick their butts and we wouldn't have done that to you. And I'm just like it. So I told him I was going to the bathroom just left from, I think that's the only time I've ever done anything like that, but I'm just like, I can't, I can't be around these guys. Did you, did you sense any feeling of remorse from them or they just want to be friends?

Speaker 2:          00:39:17       One, one or two of them? One guy for sure. He's, he's, he's pretty cool now. And um, but then one is a, is a knucklehead for sure and still pick them. You know, it's that classic thing of kids ganging up on one kid. That's a weird instinct that sometimes children have. You remember that movie Carrie, when they, uh, she goes to the prom and the, do you ever seen these basic moving? It's based on a great Stephen King Book. He didn't know. I know that cover the, the Sissy space movie was really trippy. John Travolta's in it back in the day, young and handsome. Um, but it's, you know, that's the themes that they push her. She has these crazy telekinetic powers and they push her to this point and they do it by mocking her and bullying her. They take her to the prom and they pour pig's blood on her head, which winds up killing everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       Oh Wow. Yeah. It's pretty, pretty crazy. But that's that thing that happens when kids gang up on a kid that they feel like is vulnerable. Like, what the fuck is that man? What a horrible instinct like. Is that what I mean? I, I just, I struggle to understand where that instinct comes from or why people do it. It's um, especially little kids know. I mean, I guess I could understand that if the kids have been abused themselves, they want to lash out there angry and hurt. But oftentimes it's just, they find someone who's vulnerable. It's like they find the pecking order and they'd find that one person that can get away with and they all funnel their insecurities and their anger and their aggression on this one person just because with no regard whatsoever, what kind of impact it's gonna have on that kid. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:41:01       I think. I think one of the things that makes it so much worse now is. I mean, I don't know. I get to hear some of the stuff that they can't escape it because it follows them home cyberbullying and they get the text and the, all this stuff is so it's constantly. So I could at least escape it from eight to three, eight to three I was at school, but when I came home I was, I was okay. And um, maybe that gave me a break but a little bit of a break from it. But I mean, that's, that's the world that we live in and the stuff that's happening. I mean, what you said happened. Germany

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       and other like school shootings that have happened here. I was in Aurora when the, the movie theater thing happened. Um, and it's just terrible. But then I, there's absolutely, without a doubt the zero excuse for you don't ever do anything like that. But then I kind of have looked at it maybe once before. It might be stupid for me to talk about it now. But um, I kind of can see where they've been pushed over the edge and wait, no excuse, they should not ever do anything like that. But um, for me it's like, man, they, they, it was never a fair fight. They were always cornered a outnumbered. I'm beaten down over and over and over, and then they just snapped. And uh, now it's terrible. Don't. Yeah. I don't know if that's the case of the Aurora shooter. No, no, no. He's completely insane.

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       Yeah. But I think it certainly can happen to people where they get to this point when not only do they not want to live, they don't want you to live anymore either because I mean, I'm sure if you had been in a situation where you knew someone, you had a friend who was in the same boat as you, you know, like, um, those kids from columbine, whether the two kids got together and they sort of helped each other do something really fucked up if you were involved with the wrong people at that time. Someone had a gun and you knew where these kids were and you know, you wanted to do that to yourself. Who knows what you would have wanted to do to them as well. Yeah. It's a, it's kind of a scary thing to think about. I did have a dark period.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       It was, I think it was in between seventh and eighth grade where they're hanging out with a lot of the, I don't know, just the, the kids that were involved in just darker thoughts, music, stuff like that where it, um, where, you know, hanging out with them and we're all, we're all depressed, you know, and we're, we're listening to that Papa Roach Song, the last resort, you know? Uh, I think it's like cut myself bleeding, you know, I'm never gonna I don't want to breathe again or live again or something like that. And then all of a sudden they're bringing out a, what are those? The big, big black cats are those employees or something like that. There's a bunch of frogs where we lived in the country and they'd go get the frogs blow up a frog, given another frog blow up a frog Jesus frog.

Speaker 1:          00:43:43       And also like, Hey, this is, this is a little way too dark. Sorry. The, how do you blow up a frog? You stick it in his mouth, stick in his mouth and just light it written in front. Sorry for anyone and the frog wasn't just keeps it in his mouth or something. They're hopping, hopping, hopping with it in his mouth, his mouth, because I think maybe with mat they use those because they're big, so you stick it in there and kind of can't get it out. Can't get it. Oh God, yes. A brutal. Anyway, when that happened, I was like, okay, I need to. I need to change the. That was a group of like five or six kids that were just in a very, very dark place and even ones in jail. So fuck dude, what a bar bombing me. I'm just going to do that every time you've been here. It's just been all joyful and loving and all that. I didn't know your history

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       well. Hey Man. It's just honest expression. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just it. It makes me as an adult, I almost want to go back in time and stop it from happening. You know, it makes me, it makes me very sad. It's just, it's one of the worst aspects of human beings that they could plan something like that and do that and just try to ruin someone's life just for sport, just for fun for no reason. You didn't do anything to them. It's just, yeah, it's fucked up man.

Speaker 1:          00:45:01       I see it as a thing that actually helped shape and mold me now in a way of like, I look at it, it was Loretta while we're writing the book, she's like, do you not see all these kind of parallels? And I'm like, what do you mean you grew up? He got really, really bullied. Then I tried to help people that are like maybe the most bully people on planet earth and like, Oh, I guess I see that. No, and, or was it last month? Last trip, but the second last trip to Congo, that ad was there and we're having to get a mechanic to help. We were tired and different stuff. And also I'm a drunk mechanic comes out and he's always drunk and uh, and he comes out talking with us. It's a little boy walks by. He's literally, he should be in school, but because his family's so poor, he's out selling eggs and if he's selling eggs you can make, you know nothing, but we'll never be able to go to school probably.

Speaker 1:          00:45:51       And he's just trying to make money to feed his family. And he's literally five, six, seven years old and he's coming around with selling the eggs. Normally they sell them hard boiled. Um, but sometimes they don't when they're, when they're walking around you want eat it then. But this kids were all raw and so it's even harder for them to sell them. Um, but the drunk guy picked up the egg. He's looking at it, shakes a little bit, finds out it's raw and just smashes him. The Kid, this is an adult, 30 something year old man, and this is literally a five, six, seven, eight year old kid. Just smashes it over his head and the kid looks up at him with just fear. I mean, it's not smart for me because, uh, because, you know, I'm the outsider to the government's eyes and everything else, but like I almost got in a fistfight with him.

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       I remember just pulling my hand straight back and, and just almost just back in them right across the face. And then Ben's like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Then I grabbed the, I think I grabbed a shirt, grab the shoulder and I said, Ben, translate from real quick if he ever leaves his hands on that kid or any other kid, I'm only my hands on him. And so just make sure you understand that this kind of thing. And um, I don't even know a woman that except for. I mean I just don't get, get people sometimes. Um, let's, we'll get into some positive stuff with that. That will just blew me away. I was like, you're an old guy picking on a kindergartener. I just, as a,

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       as a person, I don't understand it, but I also don't understand it. Like logically I don't understand like where that inclination comes from it, like what, what is it about a human being that makes them want to do that? Like what, how, how did that develop? How is it so common?

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       Um, I don't know. I guess when you put someone down you feel better about yourself and to really, I mean, I know what I've found is the exact opposite. When you help somebody, it actually helps you. Of course somebody you feel more loved when you, you know, so um, so it's counterintuitive, but that's kind of what people do re do the opposite of what we could or should. But it's so common. I wonder, like what is the cause, the root cause of it or does it play some sort of evolutionary role? Like what is it like, like pecking order with chickens? Like they try to find out who's the weakest one and they all attack. They'll all tackling the weakest chicken that'll all peck at it. It's like, what the fuck is that? Like why is it, are they trying to weed out the weak?

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       Is it an evolutionary thing? Is it, are they terrified of someone doing that to them? So they strike first? Well, you know what, there's actually a pretty incredible video. Hang onto. So yeah, because of the voice is actually a pretty incredible video that uh, it was absolutely terrible whenever I gave the speech or whatever. But I, I played part of the video, cut it down to like three minutes and say like 12, I think it's called the battle at Kruger. Have you seen that? No, it's in Africa. Oh, I have seen this. The water buffaloes are back in. The crocodile lion takes the, the back of the pack. The smaller, weaker, younger lions all go after that one, tackle it splashing water. They're dragging the baby out of the, out of the lake or river and all of a sudden a huge crocodile comes and grabs it and they have a tug of war match with this baby.

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       I think it was a Cape Buffalo Buffalo. Yeah. And so, uh, it wasn't a will to be straight. It was Keto flu. I think it was one of those. And uh, and yeah, it's not split. What I love almost in that analogy of where you know if you're standing by like you're encouraging it or if you're not doing anything, you're encouraging it, but if you just stand up, oh, that's the stat I saw where 87 percent of bullying happens in the presence of nobody, but in the times that it is around people. If one person says one thing to the bully, 90 percent of the time it's 80 to 90 percent of the time it stops within five seconds. The bullying, it just stops and it doesn't have to be anything aggressive. It can be a man lay off of them and then if you.

Speaker 1:          00:49:53       After that, it's something like 95 percent of the time. If you invite the bullied victim to come into your group or hang out or sit at your table or whatever, then it stops even even better right away. When you don't address the bully. You addressed the person that's getting bullied. So it seems like the people that are bullying, they almost need reinforcement and they get. They're getting reinforced by people being complicit or being silent or they're joining like those lines. One line decided to take out the little guys. They just food. You were handled. That's how they stay alive. That's a natural instinct. This is a weird either. This, the one thing I do like about it though is with those two stats, like say something, don't be passive. Whenever one Cape Buffalo turned around, a couple of other ones did too. And then we'll.

Speaker 1:          00:50:38       One came in there in the middle of the law. One hit one line through it in the air and then all of them tucked tail and ran. Yeah. Once I realized what a Cape Buffalo can actually do to them, man, that's so terrible. You know, Cape Buffalo, I was apparently are some of the most dangerous animals in Africa and they will charge. You can just so used to being around people, um, or around animals rather than trying to kill them. Yeah. I almost got us arrested and not a, not just a little bit where we accidentally, um, believe the Serengeti in Tanzania and we're on the border of Kenya and Tanzania and we're taking a shortcut from some locals, which is always fine if you're from there. And we saw this awesome, but we didn't know we were going through the Serengeti. They just thought it was a shortcut. We didn't pay for a park, pass her, anything like that.

Speaker 1:          00:51:28       And also I see this gigantic Cape Buffalo skull just sitting in the middle of nowhere. I'm like, let's get that, let's take it back. And so we put that in the back of the truck. All of a sudden we're driving and uh, we get pulled over by the park rangers. Then they see the Cape Buffalo skull. They say we're poachers say this, that, and the just swarmed by, uh, by all these, these park rangers, like three or four different vehicles and arrest me, all this different stuff and enter crew. And uh, luckily anyways, that's a random thing. But luckily we just said, hey, can I just put it right back where it was? I didn't, I didn't mean to. I didn't know we were in a national park. Yeah. They don't take any bullshit from poachers out there. It's very dangerous. They kill poachers on site.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       Yeah. They can kill them. Where it's, a lot of times it's, I'm literally the life in prison sentence for poaching. Yeah. For, for, for um, like endangered species for sure, with like, uh, the Okapi, um, one of my last trips and we'll try to, I think I maybe said that earlier, where a on one of the past episodes where someone tried to sell me the meat in the fur of an Okapi and then, um, oh, cubbies are in danger. Yes. And they're only found in the one area that we're, we're kind of working in and uh, and the rebel groups there went to will wildlife reserve for them protecting them and uh, they wouldn't hurt her, like, uh, I don't know, 15 or 20 of them sleep that were there trying to help stimulate, you know, come help them come back in the wild and everything else. There's wouldn't killed them all. Um, yeah. And then another guy was trying to sell me a, a, a rhino horn. Um, and that's just brutal. Now poaching sucks, but I love how the pygmies culture has with, with hunting. I even have a, a quick video. Um, if I, I think, um, did you see what they're doing where they're making three d printed a

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       cloned rhino horns and they're going to flood the market with them? That's a great idea. Yeah. To see if he could find that out with Jim Shark fins too, right? Yeah, yeah. They're um, Amelie's people. Each arc fens needs. It's fucked up that they're killing them all and make soup out of them, but she's, at least they're eating them. These are the Rhino thing is insane. Yeah, that's it. It's absolutely based on nothing. I mean the I medicine, but it's crazy. I just can't imagine that. Here we are in 2016 with Viagra and Cialis and all these different boner pills you buy at the gas station. That red bad takes. When I was pulling this up, I've found this bias and also three d printing and vinyl, not the solution to poaching crisis experts say, I agree that that's the best way. Well, I don't know if it's the best way either. I mean, I just can't imagine that the rhinos are literally on the verge of going extinct because people want to kill them and take their horns, which do nothing and it's. Isn't it like the same substances like a fingernail or toenail? It is. Exactly. That's exactly what it is. It's like hair. Yeah, it's. But they have this erroneous idea that you eat it and it makes your dick hard.

Speaker 2:          00:54:46       What the fuck is going on with Asia? That's a broad statement and that's why I bought it. I generalize, generalize that a billion people folks going on with Asian move. I mean I wonder. I think it's also a status symbol. I was reading that even though it might not necessarily be real or really work, but it's such an ancient cultural status symbol thing that like these businessmen will get together and they'll have like Rhino Horn tea, you know, and they. But they think it's cool because it's illegal and you can't get it and it's dangerous and it's got to come from Africa and so it must really work. I don't know, maybe that's what they think though. If favorite things work this expensive, maybe it doesn't matter their their grandfathers said it worked. His grandfather said it work. Why don't you google that, Jamie? Does Rhino Horn actually work? No, I didn't know. I mean maybe it doesn't work as good as other stuff for fingernails. Does that ever does. You just got to need eat enough fingernails. Imagine what's an acceptable source to find?

Speaker 2:          00:55:55       I don't think there wouldn't be one from China. Isn't that funny? Like you have to find a website that you trust, right? It's got to be like wired.com or story on factor fiction use on it, but what does it. What does that say? PBS is probably valid. A lot of information. I'd have to read first, but just one article about Rhino Horn use fact or fiction. I always, when I'm exhausted and I look at something like that, I go to the very bottom and say, hmm, how do they wrap this up? Overall not much evidence to support the claim to what? The healing properties of the horns. There you go. That's a good little tip I just learned from. If you're not really. This isn't life dependent. This is not something that you really. It's not really a factor in your life. Just go to the bottom line.

Speaker 2:          00:56:41       It is very strange. Oh, okay. Not believed as once believed. It's not as once believed, rather made simply from a clump of compressed or modified here, recent studies by researchers and Ohio University, whole Ohio. There you go. Using computerize. What does that Word Tomography? Ct Scans have shown that the horns are in fact similar in structure to horses, hooves, turtle beaks and cockatoo bills. The studies also revealed at the centers of the horns have dense mineral deposits of calcium and Melanin of finding that may explain the curve and shape sharp tip of the horn. The calcium would strengthen the horn while the melanin would protect some of the core from being degradated by ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, Huh? Softer outer portion worn away over time by the sun and typical rhino activities bashing horns with other animals rubbing on the ground. The inner core would be sharpened into a point, much like a wooden pencil.

Speaker 1:          00:57:41       Yeah. There were in the horn that this kid was basically trying to sell it. He was like 15, 16 years old. His Dad was the poacher and uh, his dad didn't want to get arrested so he sends his kid, um, and uh, it had all sorts of like us deep deeply scratches inside of it and stuff and are just all over Canada. The top was nicked up and stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       University of Hong Kong found that large doses of Rhino Horn extract could slightly lower fever in rats. Imagine if Rhino Horn was a cure to malaria when we would start breeding them right for like we do with chickens. And how strange it just. I mean, obviously it's not happening in the western world. It's not happening here, but it could I guess. Right? I mean some people are just fucked up. Some people, they don't care if something's about to go extinct. They just want, they want what they want and if they want that Rhino Horn for whatever strange reason, it's just.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       Yeah, well it's like, it's like a, it's like kind of with the trees, you know, we were getting ready to replant. Um, I think it's 1000 more trees which would take her total up the $4,500 on the land for the pygmies and around there, the reason that, I mean China and all these other places are coming in, they're cutting down the rear hardwoods, the Mahogany and, and reason king leopold went, there was the rubber boom and the trees there and everything else. But then, um, it's just nuts to me because I think they're, you know, they want it for greed, money, everything else. But then the people in the country, they're starting to, to, to learning, get educated in the fact that like, Hey, if we're cutting down all these trees, we better start replanting some because it takes so long for them to grow back.

Speaker 1:          00:59:25       And so, uh, no, but it's just for charcoal or fire and they're like, once that's gone, what do you have? And yeah, Booney actually the town that all of our well drillers live in. And at the university they, um, they used to be in a rainforest, now you have to drive three, four hours to get to the closest florist you have to drive three or four hours away. And it used to be in the center of the center of the reinforced, but the edge of the reinforced almost to be a forest. And that's not three or four hours drive. Yeah, it's all just because of deforestation all chopping down for logging. Fuck man, I was in Canada. And um, they, they do a pretty good job of regulating it and BC. But it's still disturbing because you, you come across these, these big gigantic fields where the trees are just gone.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       All the trees had been cut and you know, they plant som and they have the, they also have like purchase, they leave purchase for animals, which is, uh, probably like an awesome spot for like a hawk or an eagle or something like that because everything's cut down. They can see every street to the press. But it's, um, these cut out of, I forget what they call it, these patches where everything's cut down. It's so disturbing. It's like I get, I get that they replant, I get that they have a cycle. I get that, but it just bugs me that people could do that. They just. Giant swaths of the landscapes shaved off and turned into toothpicks or whatever the fuck they do with it. Yeah. And so I was in a village before my wife's first time to Congo and it was, I mean it was almost like, you know, lush, untouched virgin forest and then all of a sudden a come back next time with her coming in with worse, come back in.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       It's probably a month or so because we went to a couple of other villages, go back, start going to the same hike and all of a sudden there's this huge clearing at least 10 acres, probably 20, 25 and it was just nothing there except for a few remaining huge cut down trees that I could stand in front of and the, the, of the base or whatever it was way telling them I was a little midget next to that or fuck man. So yeah, it's pretty crazy. And I was telling her, I'm like, baby, like when I was like, take some picture of this, I think I have some pictures right here of where, where we are right now on this trail. And like there used to be trees here and it was nuts because all of a sudden for me, if I'm in the rain forest is great actually. I mean it's hot in a malaria, but uh, but uh, she, her but being under the canopy of the rain forest, going to love that because it's shaded and everything else still hot, still humid, but a little bit better. Not getting burned on, especially. Yeah, you're really pale in on the hike. I was getting burned and I'm like, man, this is a nuts. Especially on that malaria medication. Right. Right. Um, that they were talking on this, uh, documentary I was watching about the deforestation

Speaker 2:          01:02:19       of the Amazon, about how fast it's happening and how terrifying it is. And a big part of it I guess is not even. Well there's logging, but there's also they cut it down to make room for cattle grazing. And when they were showing the, just the sheer size of the deforestation of how much they've done in so quickly. And then I'm also the people that live in these areas where if they resist the loggers or they're resist it, skip murdered, especially the indigenous people that are more out there and it happens with the pygmies because they are the weaker and more vulnerable things that can push around and they can't push back. And so when you consider your life and you consider this horrible, uh, these stories that you're telling us about your upbringing, how disturbing it is, does it feel to you, since you've found this like sense of purpose in this, um, this real connection with these people in the Congo that almost like these horrible events in your life or setting you up to be the perfect person to find these folks?

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       Without a doubt. For me, honestly, it's, it's almost like a, it's the right word. Maybe maybe sort of my chance at kind of redemption or, or just not, not being the kid that I grew up being. Not that was a bad kid or anything, but just I hated myself and like, you know what I get to, he just stopped hating myself. I need to stop and I get to start loving others. Well, not just that, you also have this massive impact on other people. You have all these people that love you. You have this amazing wife. Now you have this amazing pygmy family. You have your regular family. To me, he's like, you have so much positive going on now. It's really kind of incredible. It's almost like you are the horrible experiences you had as a young kid have sort of made you into this incredible adult.

Speaker 2:          01:04:12       Oh, I think I don't know about that because I don't even know how this. Honestly, there's, there's not a good explanation that I could probably explain that like it should be working or that it's working like it is because it will with me at the front of it because I don't have any community development training or would you agree? Um, I actually don't speak the language I'm learning, but how much can you speak when he kind of wrote a mentoree? I don't even like Como te Amo. Joe? Yeah. I couldn't say my name is this, where's the bathroom? Are you doing okay? You're sure you, you're like, oh, you lost me. It's tough if it, the saying is it's proof. What does it sound like? What do they sound like? We're talking a Jimmy Pilsen pick me up that's called this kind of like our walkie talkies. Oh yeah, I yelled that out and let people know where you are. What. So what are

Speaker 1:          01:05:17       you saying when you're saying that? That is actually, that's not a word. It's just like, yeah, that's actually I'm over here. It's Kinda thing like that or we're just checking where even just excitement, just fun. I mean whenever we go on hikes, those hikes or long, right? And there's no tv or you can text her scroll, Scroll the Internet. Um, you, yeah, have each other, which is always great. But then he'd goof off. I mean, I actually know what, uh, I, I bet in one of those videos it has them speaking and it's pretty awesome. I remember that when you're saying, when you're saying the hikes, like you talking like recreational hikes. No, no, no. You just got to get you here and talk with someone talking about hikes in La. It's like, oh, I want to take my little dog to run you in. We're going to go hiking.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       Like he say hiking, and that's what people think of some recreational activity with none of those little, a little camel things, the little camelback water reservoirs you put on your back when you suck on the straws are walking. It was funny. I and staying hydrated, I took, I took a couple of those to Congo the first couple of times and I realized just how impractical they are and in a real longterm, not at, not a day hike or three day weekend or something. A lot of guys don't like those. A lot of guys don't like them. They'd rather have a. How do you say that word now? Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean. How do you say it? I think it's like, what is that? It's just like a certain type of plastic. I think it's really hard. Durable plastic that. Yeah, that people use for water jugs. But uh, that's what I would rather because the other ones too already clean and yeah, sort to fill up just all sorts of stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       But some people like it because they don't, they don't have to stop. They can just keep walking and just suck on that thing as they're walking. I've never used one though. Yeah, I used it for the first two times I went, which was like a, about a month each. And you switched to water bottles? Yeah. And then even the, they have those camelback kind of like, I think they're called like a platypus or something that's um, it's a gravity filter for water where you have a dirty water bagging. If a clean the dirty hang, hang the dirty and it goes down through a filter and into the clean bag. I've seen that. That's interesting. Yeah. Posed. See if you could find that. Does that work? Those are the, I think they work great here in the states where you're not dealing with much. Right. But whenever the water is dirty, like really dirty it, they break pretty quick so you have to backwash from and other.

Speaker 1:          01:07:47       There's, there's some that are that are good, but even the maintenance of them just really, really tough. So they work for like one filtration but they won't work the first time I went for about a month, I had it for a week or two and then all of a sudden it was heartbreaking because I was even filtering the water, you know, in the town that's coming from wells because I don't know if they, if they did it properly right when they call and, and I had been sick enough. I'm like, yeah, I hear Ya. So I'm filtering that stuff. And then by the time I get out to the forest I was able to use a few days and then it was out in the sun was stuck with just chlorine tablets the rest of the time. And you can boil it, but it's, it's just impractical. Where every single time you want to drink, you take, uh, you know, take a container down to dirty water, which could be 30, 45 minutes away.

Speaker 1:          01:08:39       I'm bringing it back, boil it, right, bring it back, boil it a filter. Yeah. And then all of a sudden, all the, the ashes getting in it. And then it's the hot humid rainforest on the equator. And boiling water doesn't cool down basically ever there. So, uh, it's, it's, it's impractical to do it that way. Fuck. But what I love now is, Oh, you know, it's guy. Let's do it. So this is this girl, first of all, she's way too hot to be in this video is very distracting. But, uh, they're gonna take this in what looks like a very clean stream. So this is so much different than when you. But people should also be aware that clean streams, although they may look clean, you can still get Giardia from them yet that, that's exactly what I learned from, uh, his name is buddy of mine.

Speaker 1:          01:09:26       We, Matt, he was the director of implementation. Now he's like the chief operating officer and he, uh, he came out there and one of the things he really drilled into us for a well drilling team. We're learning from a great guy. He's saying, Hey, you can, uh, you can drill 100 wells or 200 wells, but if you didn't do it right and proper that I would have rather done one the right way or none, none. If you do it the right or the wrong way 100 times, 200 times, um, and you are giving a village. Like he's, he just hit home hard because he's like, look, we're learning every single step. You can't skip one week. Got a drill us anywhere, you know it, you know, because we can't skip a step or miss something and then all of a sudden they are looking at it, drinking it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       It tastes good. It's a, it's clean, it's cool, it's crisp, it's in a well, but yet it can still still be contaminated, dirty. And so get real sick if you don't properly construct well no matter what. Well it is the wells here anywhere. What is the, what are the factors like when you say product properly construct, like what are the issues that you have to avoid? Yes, we man, our teams getting great. But by the way, real quick, last time I was on the show, I think we had completed 20 water wells. I went back and looked at that 20 water wells today. I got a picture sent to me and it's our 45th water. Whoa, that's incredible dude. I love it. Absolutely love it. And so what's so great is seeing that, you know, they're, they're, they're taking this on as, as their own thing, flying on their own two wings.

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       They, they were empowered in a way that's like, hey, you can, you can do this, you can do it for yourself, for your countrymen. Um, you guys are going to be more passionate about ending the suffering because you know the suffering because you have suffered, you've lost family members, you have sick kids all at different stuff. And so they're going to be able to be a better champion for this cause then I could be, because I mean maybe we have different resources where I get to, you know, you share your platform with me, which has been incredible. Um, and the kickstarter and the documentary coming out, all the different stuff is really great. But, um, but I know that the team, they're like, I, I, I couldn't do anything without them doing it. And how great they've gotten button. Well that's a beautiful thing that you've helped them help themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:11:51       Taught them how to help themselves. Yeah. Well that right there. Look at that picture. There we go. Yeah. I love it. That's that to me, if I could explain it as better than um, I've been to the world. I was just at UFC 200, uh, was that uh, uh, the world series, NBA finals, superbowl packy all fights. I mean, I've been to all these things and I mean those crowds, those huge crowds are 30, 40, 50 100,000 different stuff and that little crowd of 100 hundred 20 like to me it drowns out the sound of a entire stadium. Like it's a different kind of, it's a different kind of gratitude, thankfulness when you suffered your whole life and then you, you get to partner with people in a non. Not even talking about me like our team, our well drillers, you know, they see them coming in, staying with them, living like they're living, eating like they're eating, sitting around the campfire, like they sit around which nobody else does that with them.

Speaker 1:          01:12:52       And so sleeping in the Hudson, these sleep and um, which nobody else would do a in that area. Um, and then like you just develop this bond and really quickly and where all of a sudden they're jumping in and helping with the construction of the well and everything else. Now they do the simple daily routine stuff. Not the technical stuff, but then yeah, our guys are there. They're getting to down, which was pretty cool. That's amazing though. Now you're at 45 wells. Yeah. And what is. Do you have an ultimate goal or would you just like to continue? I think the my ultimate goal lines up with water for his ultimate goal, which I love and then with our drillers in Congo, like our goal is to end the water crisis of possible. We think it is possible and we have the technology. We should be able to do it in our lifetime.

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       Like before you were me past this earth. Like we should have the technology to get everyone clean water. Isn't it crazy shit that is, that's our issue. When when over here in America we have so many trivial things that we're constantly worrying about and fretting when when they get down to basic human necessities like water, the ability to get clean water, which is without that, all the, all the other things that we argue or bicker about, they're all. It's all nonsense. Absolutely. That's something that, oh man, that's something that I, I almost like, okay, get this crazy culture shock because I feel like I'm in two different worlds and when I'm there, so I mean there's, it's uncomfortable, but because I'm passionate about it, you know, I enjoy it. But then getting back here, sometimes it's like, man, like everything, lot of times everything that we're chasing, even me, it doesn't really matter in the big grand scheme of things, you know, how can we, how can we get for ourselves, how can we give to another person?

Speaker 1:          01:14:47       Because like, I mean, it truly is like, that's better than I know you have to take care of yourself so you can take care of someone else. Like I, I get that. Um, I just think it's kind of like this art culture here. You see kids and even adults, that's mine, right? I mean, that's, that's our culture. We say that's mine. Give me that. It's mine. In Congo, if a, if a kid, if a kid that had the eggs, instead of having an egg, if he had a bag of peanuts and he bought it for himself and then I walked by sitting down with them if a friend or not even just introducing myself, he's gonna offer me his food. He said instead of it's mine, he's going to say you want some. And so it's different in that culture where it's not, they don't have anything, but they'll give you everything that got like, for instance, um, that, that knife last time, uh, that I was able to bring back, that chief Leo may made, um, you know, he, he made a bow and Arrow and I'm actually bringing that to you.

Speaker 1:          01:15:47       It was under our crawlspace and I lost it when now everyone know where it is. But uh, it's pumped to bring that back to you. But I mean for them to give that kind of stuff away. Whenever Leo May, he's the chief of his village and now because he's got a job, he might have more. But whenever I knew him, he had maybe he was lucky if he had two changes of clothes because most of the pygmies have the clothes on their back. They don't even have a blanket, the fires their blanket. Um, and so it's just completely night and day difference. There's a lot of people that listen to this, that have gotten this far, that want to figure out how they can help. So what, what can people do to donate? We're working. They go, yeah. I mean water for his website. Is that the best place to start or forgotten.com?

Speaker 1:          01:16:33       Both of them are one in the same for the forgotten Dr. Yeah. Dot Com.org. They both work, both work for the [inaudible] dot com and there's a big yellow donate button. Click on that and have added folks. Thank you man. It's been a, it's been crazy what's going on. We're getting ready to do something that I'm, I'm pumped about me and Papa y and Ben and Matt, we had talked about it and kind of dreamed it up and uh, and we were saying how awesome would it be in the center in Buena, which is kind of a city center, maybe half less than half a million people for sure. But um, you know, in the city center where there's a university, there's a community development program that's literally changing their part of Congo by not waiting on the government or by not waiting on an NGO, like they're just taking the initiative themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:17:24       And so we've seen that they're so bought in that whenever we presented an idea of what if we could start a sustainable solutions appropriate technology center where there's land, water and food solutions and then after that maybe we can get into solar and maybe after that we can do this or that or you know, whatever. But at that place will have different stations where here's land, you can come learn about land rights, how to replant the trees, the forestry aspect, you know, all that different stuff. The ports of land and we have people there that can help and show them things. If a chief wants to come in and book our well drilling team for their community, for their, they can come in, see how we do it, why we do it, everything about it. We wouldn't have a little conference room where we can train people up on the wash program because now we're doing that.

Speaker 1:          01:18:10       All the villages that we've drilled wells in, we're going back in, we're doing the wash program, water and sanitation and hygiene. And so with that, I mean if you didn't have the, have outhouses, what do they use for their. Getting them there, getting them now. And so, uh, for the year I was there, there was one or two of the 10 villages we were in, had a quote unquote latrine, but it was only like three or four feet deep, which isn't, isn't a safe some, most of them are just going in the woods. Yeah. And honestly like that's if. Yeah, until you do it the right way with cars outside of there, some of those, some of those latrines in the city's man. I, I definitely think I've gotten sick from a fly that maybe waited there. So I mean, I don't know, but um, but yeah, so we get to go in there now, teach them how to dig the latrines, make sure it's way far enough away from the water.

Speaker 1:          01:18:59       Well, um, and then, you know, outside of that, that's another issue too. Erratic and can contaminate the water if you want. If you have to keep um, what is I think 30 meters away, uh, or more any latrines. And then if it's a, uh, like a, was that a dump? The trash dump? Um, it has to be 50 meters or more batteries, different stuff like that. And um, and so yeah, we make sure in this is what's not. So uh, uh, one of my last trips I went and we're going through Uganda on the border of Congo and there's these people, they're so proud of their water well, and I love that. But then I feel like the people, whoever did it, um, I don't know, cut them really short, they're just, they shouldn't be drilling wells because I went to the restroom and then also I look out the window and I'm at a gas station you got, is a lot nicer than Congo.

Speaker 1:          01:19:55       Um, I mean there's still terrible brutal party parts of that, but just night and day difference. Um, and whenever I looked out and see there's, here's the 18 wheeler filling up, here's someone else up in, in between that I'm, I'm at the toilets at the other side. There's a trash dump. There's 18 wheelers and trucks filling up with fuel. And right in the middle of the two fuel pumps is a water. Well, they drilled it on the, on the lot of the gas station with a trash dump with a latrines and toilets. And so it was completely contaminating in. The line was so long in. And Ben was trying to tell him like, hey, just want to tell you because we love you. That water is really not safe. Same thing, Matt, Matt kind of ingrained, ingrained that into a store. It's like, um, you know, you got to do it the right way.

Speaker 1:          01:20:43       And so ben was taught that, so these recent well that these guys had put in and it was one of the, and there's a big line of people to try to get to this, telling you there was at least 20, 30 people in line. Um, and Ben was trying to tell them in the most appropriate way possible. They're like not crush the hopes and dreams of the village there, but you also want to know like, hey, this water can, it looks safe. It's not. So uh, so that's why we're testing our wells and whatever happened in that, which is you had to leave. Yeah, I mean it's a town we don't, I've been in the town maybe twice, but um, yeah, it was the first time that I saw last time. Jesus. Yup. So, uh, but that's what's creating a lot of people don't know, like a, I think it's no, I know it is.

Speaker 1:          01:21:28       Half the hospital beds in the world right now are because of dirty water or water borne related diseases, half, half and half. Right. So if, if we were able to, if, if as human beings, if we could join forces unite, Kinda like everyone did against a bullet, if we attack the problem head on and just because we got it, we don't pretend to everybody else has it. Like we could really in this thing, we could, uh, we could fix it. Like the tools are there, the water is there, it's under her feet. And here we wasted it. And there we, they're, uh, they're, they don't have it. We don't hear about Ebola anymore. It's like, it's over. It's like they moved on to Zika, Zika, Zika, Zika. Are All the Olympians are going to get it? Yeah. They're fucked all of them. Oh, this is crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:22:18       When I got back, they were, the CDC was testing me on two different rounds of treatments trying to figure out what. So on that trip I told you going in, I got malaria right now, malaria. I keep me ask you this because you have malaria can somehow get it from, you know, if a mosquito stings you while you have malaria and instinct, somebody else, they can't get it. Uh, I mean that's what I never heard of. I've never thought of that one. But remember that when people were worried about that with HIV, they're worried about mosquito transmission. That was like the big thing. Keep away from gay people in the summer.

Speaker 1:          01:22:54       No, I, I, I had never thought of that. But I know that don't shoot here on the swamp. I know that the, yeah, the doctors that, you know, they're always saying you're, you're fine. I mean I can, I can fight and everything else. That's crazy. My blood. And you have malaria and you could fight. Yeah. But I, I literally don't because it's in my liver. I think you'd have to go into the liver unless it was a current outbreak. That, what about a liver kick? Got Liver kicked. Don't, don't let out the Bazooka, just get. Um, no, but it's, it's, it's been a lot of fun too. I don't know, I, I think what maybe kinda shifted was the kinda grown up, you know, getting bullied. You're only looking at why am I getting bullied and all this stuff's true and I am not a good person.

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       And then nobody likes me, whatever. Then when I got 23 fighting, still not really fulfilled. I was living for more for myself there. And I'm like, man, what? What am I doing with my life? And now it's so cool because seeing that and being able to tell you that last time I was here 20 water wells or 25. But regardless we've, we've done 20 or 25 more. And so that to me is a life that I get to look at. And if I were to, if I were to die, I know, I know without a shadow of a doubt that my life meant something. And I know that I would, I never felt that before, during the depression, addiction and all that other stuff. But now I know that the life I live hopefully will outlive my life. You know, like the, I want this team to doing what they're doing, climb higher than I can climb, run farther than that.

Speaker 1:          01:24:38       I can run, jump higher than I can jump, you know, like I want my. What's that saying? I want my, a ceiling to be there for. I want them to go farther than I can go because then that means that I actually made an impact that matters, that matter to them enough that it continued, that it had a residual effect that just kept kept on going and me, and that's really shifted kind of kind of everything in my life. Like, man, this is, this is what life is about. Like if I know I've been signing my book recently or ever since it came out, but I signed it live to love, love to live and I know that can sound cheesy or goofy or whatever, but that's something that just really helped me whenever I was sobering up was man, if that's what I focus on, if I can live my life to love, love now, love the live, but everyone wants to love their own life that they live and so they're just focused on that and get this and get this materialistic thing and get this different chick because she didn't make me happier.

Speaker 1:          01:25:42       You know, this or that or whatever. Whenever it's like, you know what? Like, Hey, let's focus. Let's. I don't know if that's. If that's a natural inclination to gravitate towards unattainable things like Ferrari's and mansions and you see those things on tv and the movies and you just, that shows you that you've made it and when you don't have anything in, you're wanting for

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       things and you don't have money and you're struggling, you look at someone who's got all those things and money and you think, if I only had that all my worries would be gone, then I would be happy. But if you have that and nobody likes you, you life is shit. Yeah, it's, it's still shit. Meanwhile, you are in a hut in the middle of nowhere with, well the middle of the Congo with all these people and you're having a great time and you're making wells and you're loving life that, that picture that

Speaker 1:          01:26:36       came up, I think why? Why I got so excited was um, because that night in that village, I mean we, I'm not kidding. Danced and danced and danced and in and in feast it. I mean we just all came together just to celebrate, celebrate life, celebrate each other, celebrate. Guess what? Our kids are going to be sick anymore. Different stuff like that too, where it's just a life where like, like what you were just saying, you're always comparing, comparing, comparing. For me, man. Comparison. I think for most people, um, comparison is probably the number one fif what robs us of joy, of, of being able to be at peace is we're always comparing ourselves and we always compare up. We never compared down, um, or just compare ourselves to people that are just like us. We always look at that. What you're saying is unattainable and I'm always pursuing that.

Speaker 1:          01:27:31       And my whole thing has been like recently just man, I just want, I think our, I've learned it from our team in Congo. Like that's been the greatest gift. Like you were saying that, you know, there's been a lot of great stuff that's been happening and that's true. But I, and started thinking now I think it sounds Cliche, but I'll say it anyways, where men like they've given me more of a gift than I can. I can give them. I mean, you, you see, I told you that the grown up and everything else, but to, to find a life of, of purpose, have passion of helping one another of, I don't know, our mission statement is defend the weak love, the unloved and power, the voiceless than the vision statement is overcoming oppression with overwhelming opportunity. And so if we can go into these communities and we've seen incredible stuff, that's what's gonna be in the Doc.

Speaker 1:          01:28:21       This last trip, me, Ben, Matt and Derek, the filmmaker, we would not be, they wouldn't be ashamed. Me saying this, we were in tears after an interview with, uh, one of the former slave masters that ran a hospital, um, in actually, if you could pull up a picture, it's called Cap Toula. Um, and we were at this, this hospital. And it's tough because we were trying to get treatment for Cap Tuliza. He's a buddy of mine that passed away. Um, and we spent seven months taking the hospital to the hospital, the hospital, and they're just send them away because it was the pygmy in. And it's like, I, my

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       first song actually if you bring up the maybe the first cap, that's when I saw them, that's when I saw him for the very first time or looking at a guidance is extremely amazing. Yeah. And so for me, so what is going on with his health right here, right there. We didn't know. But uh, I had, uh, I mean a gut feeling that it could have been tuberculosis because we've, we've helped several of the pygmies have tuberculosis and stuff, little grilling Faena and some others. Um, fema, nettle root cause of tuberculosis. There was some sort of a study on that. Reasons that you have a low immune system. And uh, there was something that just came out like really recently about tuberculosis. Were there. I had something to do with fire.

Speaker 3:          01:29:46       Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:29:48       Oh, if, if it's something to do with smoke, I believe that because the bacteria from person to person through microscopic droplets releasing the air can happen when someone in the untreated active form of tuberculosis cough speaks, sneezes, Spitz, laughs or sayings, Jesus Christ. Mind you get tuberculosis from a shitty song. Like some dude breaks out the Banjo, like that scene in animal house breaks out a guitar and started saying it and it gives you tuberculosis as well as an ir beating. Let's see if this. Was there, some connection with fire. I swear I read something really recently about that. Some connection between tuberculosis. Is that it? Here it is. Was tuberculosis born of fire by damaging lungs and bringing people together? Fire may have turned a soil. Microbes into global pathogen. Whoa. Many thousands of years ago. Chile. African night. That's interesting. So they think that might have started it all around a fire in a cave and that were always in the fire.

Speaker 2:          01:30:54       I can't. I can't sleep with. That's why the bugs are even worse on me because I. I have many times slept in the huts whenever the fires go in, but it just fills up with smoke toward my eyes. Just tears are coming down with the light. A fire in their hut. Yeah, that's their. That's how they keep the bugs out. Oh, well it's one of the ways, but it's mainly for warmth, but a benefit is there's less bugs and then uh, it, uh, and it can help waterproof. They're tweaking leaf huts were enough smoke and everything had kinda like a tar. So yeah. Your lungs too though, right? Of course. Yeah. And there's so many kids that are getting in at this sustainable solutions center that we're hoping to, you know, get up and running. We're wanting one for cooking where they can use either corn cobs or a or corn husk or peanut shells or different things where they can put those into little briquettes and then they can use that and recycle it and everything else in it, it burns longer, uh, at, at the same temperature. And uh, yeah. And you don't have to force anything and you're not breathing in that terrible smoke. Coconut charcoal

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       is a really fun. Um, there's uh, some company, a grilled tomato company. You know what a tomato is one of those Japanese grills. Yes, like a green egg, that kind of thing. And they sell a charcoal made out of coconut and apparently it's one of the best charcoals because it's really sustainable, it's really easy to grow and it's a, it's much wages throw it away. So yeah, exactly. People throw the outside of the cook another way, but apparently it's really good for charcoal. So Bella tour has embraced this narrative. They've embraced your story and they've made it a big part of your fighting there to, uh, let everybody know that you're doing it, not just because you want to compete, but also because you want to expose the world to this passion that this project, this, this, this sort of life direction that you've taken.

Speaker 1:          01:32:56       Yeah, absolutely. And I, it's really cool that they've done that. Yeah, no, I, I agree in that. That was the, I love it dude. I love the UFC. That's what I was 13 years old. Found the stapes and I'm just on that real quick, uh, why bottle those tapes put 'em under my bed and I would wait for my parents to go to work or to go to sleep and I'd be popping them in. Uh, the, you know, the vhs and my dad comes in and I turn it off real quick, lay down, act like I'm asleep and it's, you know, the vcrs, vhs is still moving in the, the, I don't know, the screen still lit up and everything, but he had confiscated that tape. Then when he found the rest he thought it was a, all porn, but it was a binding confiscated a lot.

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       I think me being 13 being picked on it. He didn't want me to start fighting people at school and different stuff. And so just a, just a precaution. But he always, he told my mom he's going to do that one day if we let him keep that stuff. I was like, no, it won't. But in my head I'm like, yeah, I will. I remember looking at the vhs tape and when I turned it over and saw the Jujitsu and sumo and boxing and wrestling and all these different things, like it came alive to me and it's like, oh my goodness, these guys. Well, I think I originally connected with it because because I, I'm like, well these guys are anything like me, they could stick up for themselves. They can, they're an athlete, they're popular, probably said being the laughingstock at the party. It might be invited to the party or it might be their party.

Speaker 1:          01:34:27       And so I mean I, I liked that aspect, but then I just fell in love with the sport of it and you're watching it and seeing how everything and now being a fan and watch now it's evolved and everything else. It's just, it's not seeing the guy like Dan Henderson that's been fighting, I think isn't it? Twenty years straight. 20, 20, straight. So I was there when he was fighting in 97 and I wasn't there for his first fight. He fought in [inaudible] 96 I think in Brazil. Yup. I think that was his first. I actually watched that first fight in the last couple of weeks. Really? Yeah, because

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       dude, I loved him. Awesome. Yeah. And see him even I. because whenever he stepped in, he was just a wrestler that had heavy hands, but then he just, he didn't even have to be. Yeah, you're right. You're right. Getting it was just a down and I'm taking them down and pound on them and he figured out over time how to utilize his power. That's what I want to get. Maybe I could bribe a den or big country or someone to teach me that big right hand. Do you think someone that I don't mean Dan's one of the guys that have come on, but big country always has power. Big country was known way back in the day as being a Jujitsu guy. He was one of Mark Landmines guys. And he was a, you know, like really respected as a grappler black belt. But to go from that to being this crazy knockout brawler, it's like people rarely see big country.

Speaker 2:          01:35:51       He'd never seen submitted anybody. I mean, the closest thing was when he took Kimbo down and got him into the mounted crucifix and just elbowed them until the referee stopped the fight. But then the whole season, uh, he, I think there were a couple elbows, but when they finally stopped it, we were all counting every single punch and then, uh, but he was just, just tapping his forehead like this one because it wasn't intelligently defending himself, but he didn't even have to hurt them to stop the fight. I just tapping his forehead. Well, he was almost like a, you know, when you, what does that called in wrestling when you have so many points? It's a technical. Yeah. That fall, fall almost like that. It's like you're never coming back to this 10, 10 run rule and little league baseball. Yeah, 10 points up. You just call it.

Speaker 2:          01:36:34       And uh, the big countries got very good submissions. But everybody expected that from him when he started fighting. Like if you remember back when he was fighting for a lead ECC, which was like the most corrupt organization in the early days of MMA. He had Andre Arlovski down control up working for Komora, had that control and had that double wrist lock position and it was working for the Camorra and they stood them right up. And I remember watching TV going, it's cool screaming at the TV, it's Co rob, they had a 15 second rule, like if you went, if you went to the ground, if nothing happened in 15 seconds, I think jake shields submitted Paul Daley. It was one of the few submissions and that lead to ECC, but it's just, he just mounted them and just immediately went to an arm bar and locked it in. Well, yeah, I think it's Paul Daley.

Speaker 2:          01:37:23       I might be wrong. I was actually, um, I mean, no, with kimball stuff happening. It's pretty roomy. It's sad. Very sad that man. I mean apparently he had a doctor telling them, you know, for people don't know what we're talking about. Kimbo died really recently of a heart disease and he had a doctor telling them recently that uh, he needed a heart transplant. I guess he had some sort of congenital heart disease that um, I mean, how could that be, you know, you look at them, you guys a studies in great shape. I mean, how could you imagine that he, his heart was so bad

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       that they were telling me you needed a heart transplant and this. Yeah, this could probably sounds cliche again too, because knowing him being on ultimate fighter and a and him cooking the best steak I've ever had. Sorry, big Josh. Um, uh, but he, uh, I don't know yet, even though we had a bad heart. I think emotionally I had a good heart and um, he was always a good guy. He's a very friendly guy. Yeah. Even even with, um, I mean technically we were supposed to fight I think three times before or two times elite ECC. I wish my name was in the hat for that. Um, and then because I was like in 19 or 20 year old kid, I had a decent record and then, um, but it was bad matchup so they scrapped it a get. It wasn't smart then, uh, then on the ultimate fighter I was actually matched up with them and uh, then Roy got it.

Speaker 1:          01:38:48       Um, and then we were talking about it and Bella tour were at our last fight. Um, February 19th I think, Houston Toyota Center. Um, and backstage, uh Oh, actually that was this, this will be good in a way that the dude just loved on. Been My, uh, brother and translated from Congo. He got to actually come from Congo for the, my second fight. And so the first fight actually, if you can pull up that video, it's a, it's called, um, fight day, uh, talking to my guys. But um, it's just, uh, it's less than a minute I think. And it's, uh, they, they surprised me for my first fight back. Um, they surprised with Josh woke me up and it was a guy that's like when my father figure. Got It. It's like my brother and uh, just awesome. Fight Day. My first thing you'd see in here is this,

Speaker 4:          01:39:49       this was so awesome. Who is this that's laying down to us? Media. Is that your voice? You're going to watch it? Yeah. You can't fall in from presenter, but we'll record this shit. Is it even tells you it's a beard? He had talking beard. Yeah, I miss. You guys can stop it at a minute. Yeah. Yes sir. The battle's already won before the fight. Hey, your go back to can

Speaker 1:          01:40:28       you can, you can stop it now. And then, um, it was uh, it was really cool. Like, I mean Josh was filming because he didn't want, I guess it was a surprise they were going to call me and everything else, but they were in Uganda getting more well drilling supplies and because you can't, you can't skype from, from Congo. So they were at a decent enough hotel, had wifi and they were able to skype with me the day of my first fight back and uh, me and it was awesome. It was so much motivation. Seeing them here in them and then having them come for the second fight was just a and b. There he was actually, he was actually in my corner. What you're doing is helping them by building wells is there. Once you do that, like say if you establish a series of wells and well building and everybody has fresh water, do you want to take it?

Speaker 1:          01:41:15       Another step? Did you, did you want to try to give them safer housing or cleaner housing? Do you want to try to teach them how to build houses or are you, are you planning on an escalating it from where you're at right now? Yeah, in fact, I went about it and it was a, it was a learning lesson. I don't regret it because I've got some great training here in California as a, I think it's, is it called Hisperia? California? And uh, there's something called cal earth and they built eco domes are earth bag homes and uh, what they call them, super adobe, the technical term, but they make, it looks like pygmy huts out of sandbags that they fill up with sand doing a circle and supposedly there are earthquake proof, tornado proof, all this different stuff. And this is it. Yeah, right there in a dome is the strongest structure known to Man Arches after that, or volt than the arch.

Speaker 1:          01:42:04       But yeah, I was in these exact buildings. That's like a hobbit house. What a cool looking little house house. It'll back up. But I, I went there because that's an Aztec God, right? That's that Aztec snake, snake, feathered, plumed serpent. God, Costa Rica. It might be, oh, okay, that makes sense. Cal Earth greenbuild actually level those guys there. They have, we have a lot of likeminded, um, beliefs of, of how to help people. And uh, but yeah, I loved it because housing was because I slept in the Hudson the first two times I went and got rained on and literally one time woke up in the mud, like sunk halfway because it just rained and rained and rained and rained and we were just lying in mud. Yeah. To where it just kept coming through was just washing down the hill and when my wife was there as doing it again and hold the pygmies get up and uh, they came out and I didn't know what they were doing.

Speaker 1:          01:42:57       Um, I thought someone was going on because everyone was around or hunting circle. I'm digging this trench so it wouldn't come in and get emily wet and uh, they're just so caring. So awesome. And uh, but when I saw the Hud, those eco domes, earth bag homes, I was like, man, that's something culturally sound. That is something that they would want to live in because it looks like that I looked like their similar and so this is something that you want to try to implement with without a doubt, but it has to be the right timing because what happened was, um, I, I, I knew pop one in the schools working on land and I was going to help with that too. I had no clue how to, how to get clean water. Um, I was looking forward. I was, I was in my backyard.

Speaker 1:          01:43:41       I bought everything from Lowe's back yard and he was like a website, I think literally something like how to drill your own well.org or something. And it's this guy who stand on the back of his pickup truck and he's, he's drilling a well, but what I didn't know is that's not drinkable water the way he's doing it and everything else. And so I'm in the backyard like five, $600 of stuff. Put Pvc, trying to drill my own well by myself. Um, and uh, trying to learn like me and it's so hard. There's gotta be an easier way. And so I kinda stepped around that because my, you know what, I can't help them with housing if I go here and get trained, sandbags are cheap, get a couple shovels, make some mud and get some cement and make a plaster to go around it to waterproof it better.

Speaker 1:          01:44:23       Um, and that's gonna work. But then when we kind of pastor on how to make it, make it out of a, a mix of a cement and um, soil. And uh, if, if it's got the right mixture, which I'm forgetting right now, um, it can be just as strong as or waterproof as a concreter yeah. So it's a, it's a really great thing. But when I get there and all of a sudden I see, you know, hey, uh, first, if they don't have any land of their own than building, these things are going to be worthless. Someone else can move into them. And uh, so they got to have land. Firstly, there's a process, like the most important things land in the water is water is next then food. And then for that, yes it can be healthy. I want to stay in a sweet spot in the Middle Lane and not spread ourselves too thin because you thought about this, but these people that you dealt with in California trying to bring them in and have.

Speaker 1:          01:45:15       Yeah, that would be cool. Take over that aspect of it. Yes, that would be cool. The only thing that we are, is we try to be really protective of the big means. Um, and because uh, kind of bringing in a lot of outsiders, um, most outsiders that visit them, that's not a good experience. And so just bringing a lot of random people, if it was a couple of people that really highly skilled, had the right hearts, their vision lined up with our vision of how we can I do the commute development because we want to. There's, I think there's a great book, I think it's called a helping without hurting or how to help without hurting or something like that and have it and you it to them. And it's, it's really great about how you can go about helping people in a way that helps them more than helps you in a way of, like, a lot of people help because it's going to make them feel warm and fuzzy and um, and, and yeah, and you just do that enough for random people.

Speaker 1:          01:46:13       But what if you can make a difference that, that lasted longer and it's great to do both. Right? It's great to do both. I actually love my. See someone else do some random act of kindness. Like it, it warms my heart. I love it. But how can we help in a way that, that really changes the game of, of things there? Well, I think you definitely already doing that. I mean, you're certainly spreading it. I think you feel like it's a long job and your job is not nearly done button. I don't think it ever ever will be. Oh well for water. I, I've definitely hope for that. But then, I don't know, I think I just feel, I don't know, whenever he was it, when you have that heart connection, it's kind of like, well, I want to see these people if they have, if they have everything I got to like, I still want to hang out with them all I can of course.

Speaker 1:          01:47:02       But, um, no, you know what though? It's been really cool to see. Um, so there's these guys from Uganda that came in and helped train us in there called young men drillers. And there were these guys that were, you've heard of the LRA and Joseph Kony and different stuff like that. One of the guys was, he told me around a campfire that he was one of two. It might've been three survivors of a three, four, 500 person village. The railroads came in, killed everybody. He barely escaped. And um, then another kid and another kid. And it's so cool to see these young guys all of a sudden stand up in water for, got involved with them and train them up on how to drill wells in their own country. And these are, when I say young men drillers, like I think someone were 16, 17, 18 when they started, well then all of a sudden they cranked out over 100 water wells over 100 water wells.

Speaker 1:          01:47:54       They've been doing it longer than we have. We haven't done any. I'm in the Congo. We try to get them out to us to help matt comes in to train us and to continue training with them. And then they were going to leave that team. You've got the main three guys from him, the drillers behind to train us to invest and impart their knowledge and us, uh, Matt was doing real intensive training and then these guys are going to stick around for the next three months, make sure we could bust out, you know, a, a few wells and do it the right way. And so it's so cool. They came and stayed with us and so cool to see what they've gone through all that where one of the guys, it was probably every other night or every three nights, he's waking up in night terrors where he is just screaming.

Speaker 1:          01:48:35       And I had never been around that before, um, but the things he saw, things he's been through are just so tough. But then to see he chose that he's going to take a different path. He's gonna, he's gonna, he's gonna find something that you can help people with in these, going to give it to others in a different country in Congo. So they came and lived with pygmies for three years or three months. It was awesome. Now a ben and a couple of our other drillers are in Cameroon. Um, and I, I kinda had this thing that I haven't really spoken out, but I would love to see the piggies and Congo. I'll have water. But then after that, you know, the other pygmies are suffering in very similar ways to the pygmies and Congo. And so what's so cool is that, okay, the young men drillers comes out, invest in us, pours their hearts lives.

Speaker 1:          01:49:22       They almost died. Come in to us. Their car flipped, ran over a lady, a taxi driver was driving and he ran away. She died. Oh fuck. They ran over a lady. No, they didn't. The cab driver, cab driver did and he bailed. He, he was from Congo, they were from Uganda and at the border they had to get in with a Congolese taxi driver, who will they do that? They couldn't even speak the same language and he gets in a wreck. He knows Congo, he does that drive all the time to the border. And so he just bales in literally the people in a place called a new yoga, which means a snake. And it was a place of a rebel group that used to be there and everything. And so was very, very bad part of town. There's gold mines on both sides of him.

Speaker 1:          01:50:04       Luckily this lady took them in and held him in there and called, uh, the military because people literally had an ad whenever the not the military about the cops. And it was just a little shack. I mean, he was like, well, people are going to kill them because they thought that she had killed a woman. Yes. And it in there. It doesn't matter if you know you're guilty and we'll ask questions later and, uh, someone, it's mob justice. Someone's got to pay if this person was just hurt somebody, even if you weren't driving, even if you were one of our guys was thrown from the vehicle, the car went, rolled and running away fearing for their lives. They had a, I think $15,000 of well drilling equipment and the trunk plus they had a, uh, a solar pump solar filter and it did like 400 gallons of water a day.

Speaker 1:          01:50:51       And, or foreign leaders, a hundred gallons. And anyways, they looted the, I think they set the car on fire. I know they alluded it, but then at the police station, little shack people outside hadn't shetty's a literal torches. I like those hoes that, uh, for farming and wants to have o tires, they're going to put tires around them and set them on fire. Oh God. And so luckily I'm me and I very luckily his miracle had a that papa why is such a great, uh, like an old piece of peacekeeper. Like he can go somewhere and talk with him when that 70 dispute and bring them some sort of agreement and he was able to go out there on behalf of Blur Uganda guys doesn't even really know him yet. Gets them out and while they're leaving pop wise, really respected because of, uh, you know, he, he's actually helping people in their country.

Speaker 1:          01:51:42       They like, people know him when he's walking around because he's like, oh, those are the, that's the crew that's actually putting what they're learning and action. And so he went up there and as they're getting ready to leave. So we came up to him and whispered to him and says, uh, we know where all your stuff is. And he's like, what? Like everything that was stolen. He's like, I think it was something like he said it to him there or later, why they didn't keep it and why they gave it back. But whenever they got there, it was a, the case, they've broken the lock, opened it up and uh, was Oh, one other, they open up that solar pump has got these two different. Uh, Oh man, it was more words but canisters on it and it, and they left it because they thought it was a pump and so they left that and all our wells drilling equipment and we were able to reclaim everything, get them to us.

Speaker 1:          01:52:31       They lived with us for three months, then, uh, there supply chain from Uganda to Congo. Now wrap this up where it's so cool to see where now I'm no joke. The guys that came out to learn from Cameroon that work with the pygmies in Cameroon are named a willy and turbo was their, their, their names from Cameroon. And uh, actually that, that uh, that big heavyweight, um, what is his name in the UFC now? A Francis and Francis. Yeah. Now he's him in check Congo. Both check on was from Congo, I believe. I'm not sure which one he is from. God knows huge dude. He is fucking you beast. Just a scary guy man. And both those guys ended up in France because the French speaking countries, both Congo in Cameroon. And so it's just cool to see how, how the trickle effect comes from these guys that are lucky to be alive then from growing up, then they're lucky to be alive, coming to help us.

Speaker 1:          01:53:31       Then they decide to stay in the country that they're were almost murdered in for an extra three months so that we get it down to where we really know what we're doing and then they can go back and we have this great relationship, but now another can come and learn from us. And now we're sending our team out to different parts of the continent to Rwanda to Kenyetta Cameroon to um, I think Rwanda, Uganda in training up these other teams have that are wanting to have a desire to, uh, to do the same thing. The, a crazy story, man. They're so lucky.

Speaker 1:          01:54:09       They'll stick them and tires and light them on fire. Yeah. I saw a guy, ben and I both saw guy beat to death because they called him a thief. And then rumors were that, uh, we were kind of far away. I try to get up Kinda, Kinda too scary. Close bins. Literally pull my shirt away because I'm seeing this, know who he is and he's getting beaten and kicked and most of their stuff. But Ben's like, effort, we gotta go, we gotta go. And so he pulled me away and then when we came back later I couldn't even bend my body like that. Like it's like a contortionist kind of thing where it was like bent up like a pretzel and just laying there. And supposedly the rumor was that just some drunk guys started, rumor called him a thief, called him a thief and when someone says thief, they pounce on the thief.

Speaker 1:          01:54:54       And so sometimes it's really a thief or whatever. But then other times it's some innocent guy in, you know, they can. Crazy stuff can happen. Yeah. I can only imagine. Yeah. And uh, but it's, you've seen some shit, dude, man, it's been a, it's been different, but I wouldn't change it. It's, it's beyond. It literally is wild. Like I couldn't, I couldn't, uh, I couldn't have dreamed it up for myself. And what's, what's kind of funny as them, I think, not funny. It's actually a. have you ever heard of, I think it's a book called what? They don't teach you at Harvard law. What they don't teach you at Harvard business or something like that? No, I think the author's name is mark. Well, he did some pretty incredible and I heard, I heard about it when I was high school, but Kenny Monday, which he got the, it came full circle.

Speaker 1:          01:55:48       He coached me in high school then for my comeback fight and he coached me a little bit in mma at the beginning. But then for my comeback fight and this last one he was in my corner. Um, but anyways, he told me, you know, hey, if you want to wrestle, go home, write down your goals. Like write them down in this book talks about how if they polled some class, some senior class in at Harvard and asked who has goals that are, who knows their goals and some like 87 percent didn't know, like besides I'll get my college degree from Harvard and then I'll figure it out. Then they asked, who knows, who knows? Your um, I think that was 87 percent of them or something like that and then a or 83 percent something and um, then it was, it was a 13 percent or something like that where they had, um, I'm sorry I'm screwing this up, but it was a, they, it's an incredible stat.

Speaker 1:          01:56:44       It's so 87 or 83 percent didn't know their goals. Thirteen or 17 percent did know their goals, but they didn't have them written down and then only three percent of the class had written concise, direct goals of what they wanted to do in their life. I think if you went back 10 years later and the ones that had goals but didn't have them written down, were making twice as much on average than all the other 83 or 87 percent that didn't have goals. And then the people had written down goals. They're making 10 percent, 10 times. Yeah, 10 times as all the other 97 combined

Speaker 2:          01:57:16       here is why three percent of Harvard Mbas make 10 times as much as the other. Ninety seven. Sarika behind Harvard Mba program is extremely competitive. And today admits approximately 15 percent of the applicants and 19 sixties acceptance rate was about 30 percent down to 25 percent in the 19 seventies, fluctuated between 10 and 15 percent ever since. Students who make it past the application process are typically standouts and already fairly successful by most traditional definitions. They have an undergraduate degree, typically three to five years of working experience hold on, uh, and when considered suitable for acceptance into the Harvard business school, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So, okay, so it's explaining about writing your goals down and having a clear direction. Make sense

Speaker 1:          01:58:02       in, in, um, for, for me in seeing that, hearing that. And then having coach Monday tell me that I'm honestly wrestling MMA, having goal to focus on having a gold write down. Um, I think that really helped me escape the depression for her for a while, for a few years because now I found something that I could focus on and I was passionate about it could, you know, that was my outlet. And um, but he also told me one step further, think of said this publicly, publicly. But, um, he told me write down be what's your goal, and like, I want to be a state champion. And he said, okay, go home, write that down and put it somewhere. You can see it either on your, you know, your bathroom mirror or somewhere. I put it above my bed. Um, but I didn't ever write down state champion Rodeo national champion, sir.

Speaker 1:          01:58:54       Working towards it was state champion that year, the next having a great, great training partner and I'm, I'm kind of jazzed up that the Olympics has coming up into some guys that are going. Robby Smith, he's a heavyweight. He was my roommate at the Olympic training center and travail lag if we wrestled together and high school and then after and um, so I'm pumped about it. But cds, guys obtaining their goals, their dreams and writing them down, we'll then with coach money's like, Hey, get some of your favorite wrestling moves, some pictures so you can visualize and I just see the words, but see the actual thing that you want to do, like see it. And so I went and I put one wrestling move on the left and another on the right and uh, and man, I just would go to sleep dreaming about it basically in wake up motivated to, to attain that goal national champion and having a guy that's Olympic gold medalist teaching you the basics like you, you'll get good quick that way.

Speaker 1:          01:59:50       But I'm also having the goals like I was the first national championship I won, um, was with a move on the left and the second national championship was with move on the right. Um, and it was just, it was nuts to see how all that works out. And looking back on this book and seeing like, man, you gotta write down and I, I need to update that now. I've been working on it everything else. But uh, I think a lot of us do. Yeah. I think focusing on one individual goal like that or writing something down, having a very clear thing that you're working towards. It takes away a lot of the ambiguity about that people have about wanting to be successful. And I'll just wanting to be successful, just wanting to do well, that's not enough. You have to have like a real, like something that you're looking towards something you're moving and working towards a plan and initiative.

Speaker 1:          02:00:35       And yet, well that's probably one of the biggest strengths that our team has. Has had a, the 18 employees we have, um, and at water four we write down what we want to do and it's so cool. When I came on the show the first time, um, I had gone in, I'd only experienced the terrible stuff, like nothing had happened yet. I'm only corruption and me holding the little guy that died and all this just brutal stuff on. But it came back and I finally was like, okay, I can't say no anymore. I got to do something. And so let's just write it down and do it and start speaking about it and thrown it out there. And then to see the other team. Like they, they're coming in with, uh, with the real, like, here's The big vision stuff. But here's filling in all the details, how we're going to get it done.

Speaker 1:          02:01:27       And me and my, my first time to write things down was one water, well on 300 acres of land and maybe we could build a school and get a teacher and they would help with education because the pygmies don't have any representation in the government because nobody's educated and that's their excuse, at least in Congo what to here. And so it was like school, that'd be great. One water, well and 300 acres. And now it's by the end of this year will be 3000 acres of land credible. They literally own, there'll be 10 times more. 40th five wells at 45 wells. That's amazing. Teen employees. Um, we've got three working farms right over how long, how many years you've been doing this now? A five. That's pretty incredible. Over five for sure. That's an incredible commitment. Well, thanks. It's been a, it's been awesome. Watch even even like being able to go back and had all these pictures to show you a Leo may growing Papaya trees and stand in front of banana trees and all the different stuff in the ground on what the water that they're getting from the wells.

Speaker 1:          02:02:30       Well that's the rain forest and everything. So it's, it's pretty fertile. Yeah. You can spit a seat on the ground. That's gonna gonna Sprout up somehow in the reinforced. That's great too. Are you bringing in seeds over there for these people? And they have, they have good seeds there and uh, a lot of those trees were doing seedlings and they take and they know how to garden and farm and all that stuff. Yeah. Especially at the university because they have a whole agriculture department that teams up with the community development department that they come and teach the pygmies how to do it. They come in and teach them and then they start learning how to do it for themselves. And this was, I think I can tell you two moments real quick where you went back and seeing Leo May and walking in and seeing all those banana trees blew me away.

Speaker 1:          02:03:14       And then now there is just so cool because I was leaving and there's a little guy named Ipi than I've seen them grow up. I have watched them grow up and I saw whenever his, his water source was absolutely disgusting. Like you could not ever imagine a human being drinking, drinking it. And uh, that was, that was their water source where they get water. What is that? It's this little stagnant pond kind of thing with all this mouse over it. That's. Yeah. Now what's so cool? Just picture green. Yeah. No, it's like water at all. There's definitely, it's a big, thick thing. So they'll get a stick and they'll push them to sell us to Jamie. This photo, that's what I had. And then it all lost on. What do other people could say? Oh, I see. Oh, how's that working? That's ridiculous. What is it?

Speaker 1:          02:04:12       What, what is wrong with the, uh, connection to you? It didn't because everything crashed on me. I had, dude, I didn't even sleep last night at all, zero because I was trying to send videos to water for an update video and he was at a hotel. It was a little roach motel, but it took like two hours and send one video. Then I have to do another and then all of a sudden it, uh, it just, I've lost the powerpoint that went back to. Well, speaking of videos, let's watch the video that you said [inaudible] did for you. Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Let's watch that. I want to see that. What is this? What I'm looking at right here? That's, uh, we're, we're, we're, we drilled one of the new wells. What is those things in their hands? Uh, jerry cans. They're filling. Oh, oh, I see. Okay. In fact, okay, so let's play this foundations.

Speaker 5:          02:05:08       Justin wren versus Josh Barnes. This story of that fight was the time off of a very talented fighter. It been away from the sport for years. One of those guys, when he was active, when he was at his peak, was considered one of the hottest prospects in the heavyweight division, talented wrestler, aggressive, well rounded, welcome at the time off the ring, rust, the time away from the sport against Josh Burns, a guy who traditionally wasn't a very fast starter. We thought he'd have time to warm up and he did. Burns, came right after him. A Guy I think was trying to take advantage of the fact that rent had been off for so long ran, handled it extremely well. Rent had been away for a long time, so you could see the surprise. You could see the fatigue, you could see the question of himself. You could see those times when things started working out and it started coming back.

Speaker 5:          02:05:59       The story of all his time off was on his face and his in his performance. Yeah, that's the guy making up for time off in one fight. What's easy to forget with Justin wren story with him helping out the pygmies with all he's done socially, all he's done politically for that tribe. They can't go in there with me and the pressure of having a big story on your shoulders, everybody rooting for you, everybody reading your book, that's not easy thing to carry into a fight. Every talks about how great the story is and what it does for a fighter and what it does for their career. It's also a gigantic burden and not just fighting for yourself anymore. You're fighting for everyone who looks up to you. Winning that night was a big deal for him. People don't understand what he was carrying. He was carrying ring Ross and he was carrying the hopes and dreams of everybody. He was fighting for it and he managed it. One

Speaker 1:          02:06:58       slash 27 real quick and pause it. Just one minute, 27 seconds because I just, it's great. It's right there. So, uh, the girls on the left through the cage, this is the only time that's ever happened. That's my wife. This is her first fight of mine to ever go to or see. And we've been together for four or five years. And um, it's so funny because I was throwing the knees right here and this is the ring road. The Dominick Cruz can say it's a, it's, there's not ring rust. He's just way too mentally tough and uh, and stubborn and he's away come the awesome competitor. But a dude, I, well, one I didn't train like I really should have turned that had a big factor. Yeah. And two, it was a minute, but one of the ring rust kind of things was, um, I could hear the commentators and I could, I looked out, the first person I see is my wife and I see her make eye contact with her, like we stared into each other's eyes and I know this is gonna sound goofy.

Speaker 1:          02:07:55       But uh, she got a new outfit on and I'm just like, she's beautiful. And then all the sudden I see her and she's like, oh, I'm going to fight. And he was like punching me and I was like, ah, crap. So, uh, no, it was actually right. There was the closest part where I almost finished them there with some knees are Coulda, Shoulda, woulda. And, um, and then I stopped looking at it, my wife see her and grace, which he came to Congo with us too. And uh, I see them and I'm like, what am I doing after the fight, I instantly thought what was I doing in the fight looking out, seeing my wife and thinking she's beautiful. So, uh, I don't know why I brought that up except for this, you know what I mean? It was, it was unique. And um, it was, uh, it was a blessing in that video actually was, uh, I'm, I'm glad to show it because of that.

Speaker 1:          02:08:42       But then, um, I meant to show you the one that came first, which, um, we don't play that. But what happened for the first flight back, which just kind of nuts that, um, those guys, the guys surprise me and called me in the morning and I was able to see them and they were able to encourage me for the fight and say, well, no, you're fighting for us. All that is really great than emily sent me a picture of her with. It's so awesome. Her with like 10 or 12 kids around her and they all had the biggest smiles. She says, remember, remember who you fight for and Wifi. And so a lot of pressure. It is, but at the same time she, she's, she's so awesome. Loves me and I've some reason I like pressure. I like to be under the gun or something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:09:27       What's next for you? Man? Man, I think um, I think I just, we just got pretty much settled into Colorado and joining them and may seen up there kind of a team take down was great. It kind of dissolved and I'm team takedown dissolved. You sort of just Johnny Hendricks left. Is that what he's not on there. But once you left, yeah, the coaches are gone. Um, that came in from out of state and that was a weird situation, right? It was some wealthy guy was financing the entire thing, right. One. And he's, he's a, he's a great dude. And then uh, and then he brought in a bunch of other people. But I think, I think for them it was just a, I don't know, I think they might've got burned every, well they had a deal right where they would pay guys a salary and then salary require your rent, your groceries.

Speaker 1:          02:10:20       But when you won you were supposed to give them a percentage of your winnings. I think it was 50 percent, 50, 50 percent. But you get your house payment, your car, your insurance and health insurance. You get your gross. Great. Until fighters making, making 10 million bucks. And they're like, what? Yeah, that's very true. Because if they're only spending 50 or 70 years, who will agree to that? To Johnny Hendricks? Agree to that. Yeah. So he was giving 50 percent of his purse. Yeah. I think most every team takedown guy was a johnny, might've been a little. I think it might've been a little different than everybody else's. Like a crazy deal. And how much were they paying? Not Love. I love all the guys there. They're awesome dudes. I'm, I wouldn't even want to quote it, but I know over 50, maybe under $100 a year.

Speaker 1:          02:11:04       Yeah. But uh, well that's a good investment if you get 5 million bucks back, that's, that's true. And, but it was, yes, it didn't work out because when Johnny started making real money, that's when he. Is that when he left or was there other issues? I think it was, it was, it was that. And then I think, uh, I think internally there was some, some butting of heads between a few different people between me, maybe coaches, maybe management, maybe fighters too. And um, so now you're in Colorado. Now I'm in Colorado. Were you trained in Colorado a while? Be My home gym will be Grudge Training Center, which is actually pretty cool. There's a instructor named drew, that's pretty great. He came in, he opened, I think he opened up, maybe I'm wrong on that one, but 10th planet Jiu Jitsu and I think boulder, but now he has one in Arvada which is inside of grudge.

Speaker 1:          02:11:53       And so now we had a 10th planet in there and he's, he's actually so in some slick darce jokes and uh, and yeah, that's awesome. Some stuff that's his belt too. I have a fight lined up for you maybe, um, maybe November, December where we're looking at that and the thing that I want to do is getting a real. I haven't given myself time to settle, to really train to really focus and I know that now it's a time crunch, you know, 29. I know that the youngest heavyweight I think is still jds and junior. Dos Santos and I'm in the top 10. He's 32. I mean Barnett's I think 38 and time to mature later. Forty two. Well Brock has pretty much done now. I think that last positive tests to positive tests in a row. He got one before the fight. One after the fight.

Speaker 1:          02:12:45       It's most likely one and done. Yeah. Um, so I, I got, I got some time. You thinking about going to the UFC, are you. So you have this ballot tour deal is, are you enjoying competing for Beltour? I, I have thoroughly appreciated how they've been treating me. They've been. But you're mentioning all these MMA fighters from the UFC. So are you, are you thinking about going over there? Is that what's going on or I mean, I would never be against that because I love the UFC. Love MMA and that's a big, big platform. How long has your deal at bell or four? I have two more fights and um, so I'll, I'll, I'll fight to more and for me, I mean reason we're in Colorado. First is I wanted to get my wrestling back because I'm pretty disappointed. My first two, I honestly winning this was the first two times winning felt really good because I did it.

Speaker 1:          02:13:39       I didn't do it for me, but then the same time right away the competitor comes in and is like messed up here, here, here, here, here, and I think pretty much every guy taking the ground finished. It's like, why am I trying to outbox the boxers whenever I need to. I need to wrestle. You need to take them down. Is it difficult for you to balance the two worlds? Because you know, you have one that demands incredible attention, your fighting career demands incredible attention and then you have the other that also demands incredible attention. You have an amazing commitment to these pygmy people and uh, this incredible passion and love for it. But then you also have your urine, the date most dangerous combat sport in the world. I mean, it, it requires massive attention. Like we were talking about Francisca. No, like if you're gonna Fight Francis, now you got a fucking batten down the hatches.

Speaker 1:          02:14:29       You got to be in incredible shape and for being consistent, dedicated and no excuses. And um, that's, that's what left a pretty sour taste in my mouth after these last two fights because I knew I hate doing that. Like a rushing it or getting in whenever prepared. And um, are you training at all when you're in the Congo and how often do you end the Congo? A now I'm now I'm going to start going back just after every fight. When I fight, go back for a couple of weeks. I'm trying to be real safe this time it took my own food. I'm like all of it, like an entire check bag was just kind bars, Lara bars and all these different green smoothies and different stuff. So I was, I was, I wasn't even eating any food, they're still got sick and so had malaria.

Speaker 1:          02:15:16       Then after that I got shingles, which is crazy. It was completely across my forehead and over here. So there's like the middle of the trip that's coming back at case, right? Isn't that like kind of a herpes, a it chick? It's the adult form of the chicken pox. It's a, it's brutal. Like it was. It was a different pain than I've ever felt because it's a nerve pain and that was out in the forest and there was a couple, two, three days where we were there for the documentary, for the water wells, everything else. And we got a team that came and so we gotta we gotta get it done. So I kind of stayed back a couple of days but then while we're out there in different stuff, like a rebel group actually came, like I believe it was three miles from us and only about a mile away from our truck. And so I'm sick. I can't get back to the hospital that I just came out of from getting treatment for malaria to get treatment for shingles and then, uh, so that was tough, but for me to answer your question like I want to be, I want to be realistic, but at the same time a quote my mom taught me, I forget who it was, but she said something like, uh, I'm an optimist is someone who goes after moby Dick in a rowboat and takes the tartar sauce with them.

Speaker 1:          02:16:38       Optimists goes after moby Dick in a rowboat and takes the tartar sauce with them. So for me, I want to be, I want to swing for the fences, make the biggest impact possible, but at the same time, like we, we're restructuring stuff. We had meetings at water four and I think just getting everyone on the same page. Well me too, because I was listening to the biggest thing possible is the UFC heavyweight championship now, without a doubt. Is that a first ballot where then UFC or is that a thought that you have in your mind with. Well yeah, the one will be on one of those goals. Okay. At UFC 200 is good. Sound goofy to anybody else. I think a lot of athletes would probably get it, some might not, but you know, I, I bought a UFC replica belt because, uh, I want to, I'm not gonna hang it or anything, but I want to have times where I set that down on a table or a desk and look at it, think about it, dream about it and know that before I go out the door training, um, you know, that's, that's a goal of mine, you know, if I could get there then I know this fight for the forgotten can be set up for, you know, the, maybe the rest of, of my life there, you know, it could keep going on and on further than it would if I didn't.

Speaker 1:          02:17:49       Realistically to try to attain that sort of a goal. Like it's going to require more than just staring at a belt or writing something down. You're gonna you're gonna need to go on a rampage. Yeah. We've, we've, uh, we've surrounded it. Will water forest surrounded, fight for the forgotten with like a team of like eight people from media to my sports agent to lawyers and I'm just, all these, all these people are incredible. And I'm sitting in the room with them at a conference table like this. And I'm like, like, what am I doing in a room with these incredible people? And they're all, yeah, they're all focused on me. And knowing the story in like lookout, I don't know if you'd call it raw or pure or like, like in they're getting behind it, which has been incredible. But then they just overwhelmed me saying we want to free you up in a way.

Speaker 1:          02:18:39       We're kind of talking a little earlier was alluding to it, but, um, you know, I, I really got to readjust everything in my life of how I'm training because when, now that I'm getting settled into Denver, um, out all go up to number one to three times a week and then also be under the Olympic training center. I've been talking with Brandon slay, the old freestyle coach, which he actually just moved to penn state. Um, but, uh, talking with uh, and had access there at the Olympic training center and about, hopefully I can get in touch with Matt Lindland. He's the new head coach for the Greco team there. Um, but with, uh, have you ever heard of Adam Wheeler? Adam wheelers an absolute beast and I wonder if I have that video in there, but, uh, there's one if you just search Adam Wheeler on Youtube, should we called ISO pure. But this dude is an Olympic bronze medalist and a black belt in Jujitsu. Anyone Nogi world's heavyweight. And so he's a beast, just an absolute monster. And so, uh, I was helping them train for the 2008 Olympics and stuff and um, it was pretty great. Oh, here it is. This guy's a beast.

Speaker 1:          02:19:43       We're not hearing anything, Jeremy.

Speaker 4:          02:19:45       Correct. She got into wrestling. So I was in high school. There was a point when I'm starting to getting into a little bit of trouble and just hanging out with the wrong crowd. My wrestling coach, he's the one that Kinda put me back on the right track. He taught me what work ethic was. I try to be the guy who motivates people, pushes people. The most peer moment of my athletic career is 100 percent the Olympics. Even though I didn't win, I still was on that podium representing my country for the sport that I put so many hours into. That feeling is indescribable.

Speaker 1:          02:20:22       And the point is, is the guy you're, you're working with or something. Yeah. And sorry, I probably should have set that up a little better, but this guy is an absolute monster and we've, we're, we're, we're getting together and starting to. We're going to start working out and he's at Prime Jujitsu, knew in Colorado Springs, but they cross train with eastern's and here's the thing. I'm all over the place, but he is the only guy to be trained. So we're all jumping. Do Squat jumps a row by row with these bleachers. And I promise he's skipping one at least and sometimes too. And he just, he was flying up there. People be halfway, three quarters of the way. This guy is six foot four, 235 pounds solid muscle freakish athlete. And uh, he's just. So there's a training partner for training partner so, well I guess what I was trying to allude to is me and I feel like how water forests around me with such an incredible team to achieve success that we fight for the forgotten in now and really trying to do that with, uh, with fighting because if I don't then I'm gonna fail and I'll be wasting time.

Speaker 1:          02:21:22       But if I, cause this isn't a, it's not a, it's not patty cake, right? I mean we're, we're going in there and we're throwing down and I've got my head on straight. You as you move up in competition for sure. Without a doubt. I mean, when you're looking at the competition you faced in beltour there good steps. It's tough guys to fight against their. They're good steps. But if you were the timing of everything. Yeah, yeah. If I, I'm, it's A. Yeah, it's not, it's not. I guess a swinging for the fences are taking the tartar sauce with me. If I see that, uh, that it's not going to happen, then you know, I hate saying that because I want to fight so bad, but fight for the forgotten is more important in a way. But I mean I think it's possible. I really do and I think, I think it's possible to. I think you've also brought a lot of people in to help you with fight for the forgotten to pick up the slack as well and you've started a movement. I mean there's a lot going on here besides just your involvement. You've started this movement and being with water for

Speaker 2:          02:22:26       and, and writing the book and letting people know about on these podcasts and, and educating people to what your goal is and what, what you've been able to accomplish over there. He started a movement. So I think man, I mean if you really can do it, it would be absolutely incredible and it certainly would shine even more light if you could really become successful as an MMA fighter from here on out.

Speaker 1:          02:22:50       No, I, I agree with that with, but it's going to require everything requires everything. And I feel like there's, there's two parts of this where I'm mean the, the fight for the forgotten guy in me wants to be, wants to be humble and everything will say, you know, it's not going to happen. Listen to all the right things, which is the same on the other side of the coin. But I'm a at the same time. I feel like if, if I can just get the time, I haven't been getting the time, uh, to train. And one of the things that you have to make the time. Yeah, we have to make the time and it's got to be the priority. And I don't think I, it can't be some six to eight hours. I mean like 68 whenever I was telling the guys at water four and it's just because they don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:23:39       They've been incredibly supportive. But whenever I broke it down like winter training schedule, what time do you train a day? I mean, they know some nfl guys and stuff like that that might train once a day for four or five times a week or maybe twice a day with them. And they, it's just so different that they're like, oh wow. So that's why they've rallied around me and I think that through that it's going to free me up to really good all the right places. Get up to grudge for my strike and get to the Olympic training center from a wrestling. Get around these black belts in world champs in Jujitsu. Get around the 10th planet guys. Get around this so that we can, we can take this the farthest that we can.

Speaker 2:          02:24:14       Beautiful. Yeah. All right man. Well listen, um, again, one more time for people at home. Fight for the forgotten.org. Fight for the forgotten.com. Uh, what is your big pygmy on, on twitter, on twitter and instagram? That's the big pygmy. I've translated some abouti among both. They go, yeah. So it's the big pygmy fight for the forgotten to work. Oh, this is something that, that I just found out that water four. Does that mean $25? Some of the people have been so generous. Donors have given a full water well, but even just $25 a month, if that's possible, it gives water to 15 people per year. If you do it the next year, it's another 15 people that could save their lives, save kids' lives. And so, um, I just know it's being used the right way and a passionate about it, seeing it in action.
