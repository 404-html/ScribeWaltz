Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Hi. What can I do that they're your fellow. I see what you did there. Uh, hey everybody. What the fuck is going on? We're back. Uh, before we get going, we've got to get through our business points. We've got to sell you on some shit that you don't want or tell you about some shit that you've already heard about a hundred times before. That's what we like to do. We'd like to be repetitive and then bore the fuck out of you. That way when the podcast gets going and you're like, God, this is so much better than that fucking commercial. It's the a four players. No, it's more the blue balls. You know, it's like, you know, those insecure comics that would always bring terrible opening acts. That's what that's like. That's what it's like. The commercials are our version of a terrible opening act. Uh, one of our sponsors this week is Tang.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       If you go to rogan.ting.com they will offer you a 25 bucks off or either cell phone service or one of their new android phones. Tang is a a cell phone network that uses the sprint backbone, but they have their own rules. You don't have to have contracts. They have great phones, they have great deals, excellent international rates. Like Brian had a great time with them up in Canada. It was like a fraction of what does at and t bill was and he used it all the time. The service is excellent. It's not like a Mickey mouse network at Sprint and they just have it set up. So they buy time on sprint and they give you a better deal. They also credit you for unused minutes. Like if you, uh, if you have a certain rate that you're going for a certain amount of minutes, if you use less than that, they, they, uh, knock you down to the lower number and then they credit you the difference when your next bill. So super ethical company. It just, it's really, I liked the idea behind it. I don't like contracts. I liked the idea that you can get the, some of the best high end android phones, like the Samsung Galaxy s four. And the the, the note, that crazy fucking tablet phone, they have that too. So rogan.ting.com save yourself some

Speaker 2:          00:01:54       money.

Speaker 1:          00:01:55       Speaking of save yourself some money. You how gross would be if that's how I did my commercials all serious like that. stamps.com is a, another one of our podcast sponsors. If you buy any of Brian's tee shirts, you know Brian read Bam, who's not here right now. He's doing one of his uh, Tommy's store podcast. He did all those desk squad tee shirts that you see the kitty cat on them, that's all his artwork and he prints them up and then he sends them himself using stamps.com and he openly says that if it wasn't for stamps.com there's no way you'd be able to do this because he'd have to wait in line at the post office and they have to measure each box and wage box. It's, it's annoying if you're trying to do, if you have a small business and you're trying to send things through the mail, stamps.com is a fucking amazing resource.

Speaker 1:          00:02:38       You do all the shit on your computer, you do all the you, you, you enter in the addresses, you weigh it on a digital scale that they provide. And when you print it out, you just stick that on your shit and then put it out for you. But for the post man and then you're done. You don't have to go to the mailbox. And I have to weigh things and measure things in a where a bunch of people are mad. You have all this shit. If you go to stamps.com there's a microphone in the upper right hand corner, click it, entering the code word j, r e and save yourself 110 bucks.

Speaker 3:          00:04:28       So what does legal zoom do

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       with legal? Zoom does, it's not a law form, not a law firm, but they provide self-help services, uh, at your specific direction that you can also connect you with an independent attorney if you need additional guidance. Now if you go to legal zoom, like everybody knows that go into a lawyer is very expensive and it's also very time consuming. And what they have done is sort of set it up so that you can go to legal zoom and you can get businesses started.

Speaker 4:          00:07:22       Jamie, the podcast begins officially

Speaker 3:          00:07:31       Joe Rogan podcast by night. This is officially where the Sirius Satellite Park starts. All right. The other part with the commercials is only on the Internet. Got It from here. That's why it seems like we don't need the music, which you could probably, there's probably a better way to do this. It's probably a real momentum killer to doing the commercials as a part of the city and wants something. I wouldn't mind if you did them through the show because grandpa's got appeal lot and the last time I was on, I didn't know I can get up anytime or this time. Just brick a bucket. Have you ever had a cabinet? No. Cheese and crackers. Those are my two biggest things is that getting a cancer, which I got. So I'm over that and it really, but you, by the time you need one you, it's sweet relief. It was the nicest thing.

Speaker 3:          00:08:20       Anybody that's bobcat. Goldthwait, bobcat. Goldthwait tonight I'm scratching Goldfarb. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for having me back on. I have been being, I really fucking love your big foot movie. Watched it last night and uh, I was really psyched to watch it cause I'm a big foot dork. I'm a big flower from way back, you know, I know that. But I also was, you're the first person that gave it to that didn't see it with an audience. I've been doing some screenings at film festivals and things and I thought it, I was worried cause I'm really happy you liked it cause cause I didn't know if it lose something sitting by yourself.

Speaker 5:          00:08:56       Oh No, no, no. Because it's fun to watch the movie with an audience. I was involved in more and um, it was beautiful because it was a really, uh, Baltimore's great and so a really mixed crowd. Uh, and I mean all races and all working classes and stuff come to this festival. So I'm sitting behind. It was beautiful through, through the movie I was sitting right next to the couple of black guys who were beautiful.

Speaker 4:          00:09:20       They're going crazy. I can't tell you which part where I was foot and they were yelling and it was made me so happy. I had to ask you about something before we got on the air because it was such a creepy movie. There's so many moments and I didn't want to give away any spoilers, so I knew, I'm like, I kind of ask him this.

Speaker 5:          00:09:39       Well, yeah. And the, and yeah. So I try not to talk about some of the things that are revealed, but I just talk about it. A lot of them moving out. I'm really happy. Thank you. I mean, this is the first review. I mean, you've got a couple, I shouldn't say there's some nice reviews online, but, uh, that, that's really nice.

Speaker 4:          00:09:53       I loved it. I loved it. And one of the things I loved about it is you, you are completely true to big foot lore. Like you, you added in all the stuff that heart, like the knocking and the howling sounded exactly like a real Sasquatch was ugly. I didn't go in

Speaker 5:          00:10:09       to be snarky. I mean, I think the movie's got stuff in it. That's funny. But I, I wasn't trying to, you know, I wasn't trying to mock, uh, believers in Sasquatch. I just, because of a couple of reasons. One. I've always saw myself as as an outsider, so why am I going to pick on one of the most picked upon? So cultures, you know, I was talking to Dan Harmon and we were breaking it down like and picked upon or misunderstood groups. It goes like ren fair enthusiasts, then it goes a Taliban and then Sasquatch enthusiasts like as far as people will cut him some slack or, alright. Trying to understand where they're coming.

Speaker 4:          00:10:45       Yeah, that's hilarious. That's so true. Pour Sasquatch hunters. You don't catch it. Don't catch a break ever. Well, you know I went to where the

Speaker 5:          00:10:52       Patterson Gimlin footage was shot. That was the, and and that was the germ of the whole movie for me really was I, I, it was me since I was nine years old wanting to go to that site. That that's really, and then I happened to make a movie,

Speaker 4:          00:11:04       but, but that's the reality of it. This show that I loved the tie, I didn't well up, but I did. I'm sure I went to, I don't believe in that footage. I think that Bobcat Patterson footage is utter horse shit. But why? Well, first of all, because there was a guy that, uh, that says he did it named Bob [inaudible] Bob and is can't find it on a map though. He can't find bluff creek on a map or he couldn't, I mean, he was gone, but yeah. Well you just, because I can just a lot of places I've been and I couldn't find a map. Yeah, that's true. I go home and I go, I know I lived here. I knew I lived on this street. I know that's where Douggie tool and I hit Danny with a shovel, but I went back to where I went to high school. I was like, I killed someone. I want to clear that up. I did not. Where did you go to high school and Newton, South Jersey and Jersey was, yeah, but

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       uh, I lived in San Francisco. It was a long story, but it's age first one through seven. I lived in New Jersey, seven through 11 San Francisco, 11 through 13 Florida and then 13 through 25 probably in New York, Boston, and then New York. It's a 25 New York, 27 La. And it keeps coming.

Speaker 6:          00:12:14       It's a, it makes for an interesting person. Uh, the only let your child like, yeah, yeah, yeah. We have a new kid every time. Everywhere, man. Really? Yeah. That's why I learned martial arts. I got tired of people fucking with me. They would, they beat you up. People always threatened to, I got lucky that I avoided it. But you're a funny guy. I mean, did you use that? It wasn't very funny. You're going to be honest. I wasn't going to head writers. I mean even, you know, you know that you've got good delivery. No, it wasn't

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       well enough to be funny. I probably would have been funny around people if I got to know them really well.

Speaker 6:          00:12:50       This class, it wasn't really quiet. Yeah. And then getting picked on and then you learn how to kick ass. But how often did you actually have to use it? Never. Yeah. That's the thing, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:13:01       I've got one fight in high school. It was really quick and uh, it was, it was, you know, I probably could have avoided it. Like sometimes I think about it, I could have avoided it.

Speaker 6:          00:13:09       And do you regret? You didn't know a little bit because I heard the kid. Sure. I didn't hurt him bad because this stomach along with this fight, it's pretty quick. Yeah, it was. It was at a point where I was, uh, I was completely like, oh, I was competing a lot in martial arts tournament. So this guy hit you. I mean he, he was going to and he took them out. How many hits? It was just one, which is kind of bad ass. But now if you didn't know you could do that, you wouldn't respect it. Well, it's also, I probably did it to show off, you know, I could have avoided it. I could have avoided that even though he's kind of a Dick Guy. Yeah. He's also a young kid just like me. We're both retarded. Great. Now to your ears, make mistakes sometimes just start things you don't even want to finish, but you're stuck in a quagmire. It was there people around. Yeah. Yeah. It had to be the last fight. I mean that no one probably messed with you after that.

Speaker 1:          00:14:09       Well, I mean, people are always, if you are looking for trouble, you're going to find Trump. Right. I was never, I never looked for trouble. Right. But there's, when you're in high school, there's unavoidable situations where you,

Speaker 6:          00:14:21       you want to be somewhere you like. You know what I mean? In your life, you have control over what you choose to do for an occupation a year with the kind of people maybe like maybe my shape and everything protected me from, you know what I mean? Like if you kicked my ass, you'd be, it's embarrassing. Oh, you can go play tennis. Oh, big deal. You kicked the fat doe. Hey guys. And did you, did your fists gets stuck. There was a section noises,

Speaker 1:          00:14:47       but I, I never was like, I, I always want it to avoid, you know, the only reason why I ever learned martial arts at all, it was so that I would be scary enough. So people left me alone

Speaker 5:          00:14:57       like a mat. And I always, there's a bit in my act about, you know, the, the voice of depth and that that's, you know, I'm going to kill you. That guy's going to kill you. You know a guy who was like, I'm going to dump drunk Jack that his buddies got to pull him off so he doesn't get in a fight with you man.

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       So many scary people in my life as far as like physically scary people, especially all the years working for the UFC. Right, right. Like the idea of running around in the same world as some of these people. It was fucking terrifying. You know, cause it most like UFC fighters are very calm and they get it all out in the gym. But yeah, if you zig when you should have zagged and you run into the wrong person and the wrong time, like many people have your, you're, it's like it's up to them whether or not you stay safe, it's up to them whether or not they just beat the fucking shit out of you. I've seen it happen before. It's really just, I saw a guy get knocked out in Denver. I was at the comedy works in Denver. It was a really cool place and I saw something happened that totally didn't need to happen. There was a guy who was walking down the street and he was really fucking drunk and there was another guy who was sober and the guy was drunk, said something stupid to the guy who started it, but he wasn't a threat. It was great. Clearly not threatened. Right. But then the guy who is sober just beat the shit out. Right. And you tell the dude was totally impaired and the other guy was like stronger, more athletic. Anyway. He was just looking for an excuse to beat the shit out of something.

Speaker 5:          00:16:18       He just wanted to beat someone up. It's like the heckler figures out they're going to heckle. And the guy who gets in a fight, you know, before they even leave the house. I mean, I really,

Speaker 1:          00:16:26       I believe that some people do. Yes.

Speaker 5:          00:16:29       Well, I don't know how we went from big foot too to ask kicking, but that's all right. I mean it does, but you know, it's like I'm not proud that, that I have the ability to really, uh, and I'm not known for this. I mean people, a lot of folks aren't familiar that I understand that, but you know that I can really decimate someone in the audience. I can really, really, really bad. And, and Shanker, I truly don't usually even my daughter and my new wife, the o nine my ax is, they all go, oh nine the, oh no, yeah, she's still got the new car smell. She's so, so like the whole nine, you know, they see this like switch go and they leave the room, they get uncomfortable and it's just like blah. And I'm really not proud of that, that it's a horrible skill, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:17:16       Well, it's a defense mechanism for doing standup, but like you don't even, I mean, when it gets going, I truly don't know. I mean you talk about the comedy works, man, it was just a, Oh my God, you know, how people will yell out where they're from and then there's this horrible nightmare. And I love the comedy works. I think that's probably, if not the best club, it's one of the best in the whole country. But at one of those, you know, a horrible shows. And if people go do the little boy, the, you know, they want me to do this voice from the how they know me from years ago and I'm not doing it. And, and then there's a woman in the back of the room, she goes, I'm from Aurora, and I go, I know you've learned to sit in the back.

Speaker 5:          00:17:55       And I truly didn't think of that in advance, you know, and I felt then I feel bad. You don't want to such a weird response that even the crowd like kind of didn't go. Oh, they kind of just pretend they didn't hear it because it was so weird and horrible. But like, I really kind of, the switch goes and I say things and I'm not saying I don't take responsibility for them, but I'm usually later on kind of a surprise that I said, you know, I berated a table full of women this one night. And uh, and they were very, you know, they're acting like the show is all about them. And I just paraded his table women. And then one stood up sobbing and she's like going, I, by the way, I forgot even what I said. And it was a couple of minutes later. By the way, people love these kinds of stories and they love watching it. I mean the bars never emptied out. You know, two guys are getting along in the parking lot. Let's watch. So I'm up there and this woman stands up crying. She goes, I'm not a whore. It's my birthday. Oh, these are the things I'm not proud of. So

Speaker 4:          00:18:56       do you think that there comes from doing standup and bars or ground Boston to building the fence? My course in Boston, that was the hardest, hardest place to do stand up comedy. It was, it was horrible.

Speaker 5:          00:19:07       It was. But, but when I got started, it created so many unique characters and so many, you know, I got started and it's like, uh, you know, who came out of that group? It was like, you know, Lenny Clarke and Denis leary and Steven Wright and Barry Crimmins and you know, just all these different, unique voices that came out of my front, Tony V. And so it was really tough to do comedy, Paula Poundstone but you were forced to have your own, your own voice, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:19:35       Yeah. You guys were ahead of me. And when I first started doing comedy and started doing open mic night, I was really aware because of all you guys, like what a crazy scene it was. It was, I mean it was released a few places on earth. People are hate this on my podcasts. Well, oh they're going to talk about Boston comedy. Sorry, Bill and I have had these conversations and I'll tell one or two bucks now. It's amazing place

Speaker 5:          00:20:02       on your buckets. But, and I, and I, I really rarely talk about it, but, but I, I am, I don't drink, I don't take drugs, but I don't tell people about it. But I just did. But I, I have, I haven't since I was 19 years old. So this story is that long ago I started doing comedy when I was 15 I got an alarm. I was 20, so this is like a story when I'm 18 with a, I'll say as Lenny Clarke and all these guys, and we boarded up the doors and the windows at the Dingo with cardboard, right. And we're just drinking and doing piles of blow and um, and the, and, and, and all night. And then the door opens and it's like smokey and backlit cause the sunlight's pouring it and it's, it's a bunch of cops come walking in and I'm just high and gacked out of my, and I'm going,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       I'm going to jail, I'm going to jail. That's all banking. And the cops go, Lenny, you fucking cock sucker. I sit down and they start doing blow and I'm like, yeah. And I'm like, there is no, there's no god. Yeah, yeah. I was down, it was it Chinese comedy club and we would, we would cut lines on the, on the ribs, you know, the pork ribs. We'd be in the freezer, Chapman lines on those orange pork ribs, the ribs, the redwoods.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       Oh, that's hilarious.

Speaker 3:          00:21:20       Yeah. To be a flat surface. And then I'm just thinking like these families that get served up. Oh my God. Blow covered pork groups, juniors bouncing up. Whenever we go to the Ding Ho, he's so animated. This was like in the 80s did you guys get real coke back then or was it all chopped up still? I think we were, we were getting high. Yeah. No, but you know what I'm saying, like don't know the difference. I mean I really, I've never done coke, so I did it. And then, and like I said, I stopped everything when I was 19 I know people don't believe

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       the folks who do it though. We'll tell you there's like rockstar coke, like pure code, which is amazing. And then there's like, you know Tom Sawyer from the, from Cobbs. Sure. Tom will tell you, like if you talked to them about the old school, like rock star coach,

Speaker 3:          00:22:05       I've talked to some of the Boston comics who like, you know, I didn't, I didn't quit because I got syllabi I could cause of the, cause they shit got bad, the coat got mad, disappointed in the quality of a blow. We'll play again fucking high anymore. Apparently it's very different experiences with you get

Speaker 1:          00:22:21       real cocaine, a hundred percent pure cocaine. It's a very different experience than what a lot of people are getting. His speed. You're getting like coke mixed with some sort of,

Speaker 3:          00:22:30       no, because I would do, I had done speed and it didn't affect me the way the Koch did. So that's my Pepsi Challenge. It's very scientific. I don't know. They cut it with things. I don't know what they're cutting this baby laxative and vitamin B's. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:22:44       One with um, uh, XTC they cut away, cut it with speed. Apparently speed. Sometimes you don't get all pure x. You get a bunch of funky amphetamines in there. Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:22:55       So what we're trying to say to the kids don't do bad code. No. You, yeah. So you guys were doing it with the cops, the cops. I mean, the guy's a guy would steal some guys joke and then somebody's arm will get broke. I mean, it was not, I mean, it really, that's the reality of it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:15       Dane Cook was on the podcast once a week. He and I were talking about how they're the guys who were doing comedy, where men like Kevin Knox and Lenny Clarke, these, these big men, it's like manly. And it was

Speaker 3:          00:23:27       a very, it was just like if very aggressive for, yeah. Yeah. It wasn't like on Gavin and people are going, oh, you're in Cambridge and there imagine that you don't got pipes. And we got patches on our sweaters. Like, Hey, you're coming out with like one of those [inaudible] suede jackets with the Ambien Tasseling Dang

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       like an overstep chair with it. And we sitting there and talking to him about, um, uh, Noel coward references and stuff, you know, but no, it was, uh, it was pretty down and dirty and not, but, you know, it was the best place to train. I mean, cause you know, you, you, you were ready for the hackles were insane that the violence and uh, it really is weird to think about how much comedy and violence was in that scene. It was a crazy scene. It was, uh, I, I'll try to keep some of the people out of this story, but one of the guys I was with one night, you know, when someone's party and then they just, the switches thrown and they become Gorgo, you know what I mean? Like they're just not themselves completely, you know what I mean? And one of our buddies insisted that he and I were vikings and he was really committed to this character was he was a viking and he was holding me in a headlock and he wouldn't let me go.

Speaker 5:          00:24:41       And, uh, and to the point where it got creepy, like he was just dragging me around the bar, it was funny. And then it would go for a long time. Like I was at, you know, and I couldn't do anything. He was much larger than me. And then Barry Crimmins, I remember at the time I had a, um, had a, a cast and the guy who had me in a headlock, who by the way is a friend and he just had a rough night that night. He says, Carmen's goes, because let him go. And he goes, and the guy goes, hugged me or hit me. And Cummins goes, it was the fastest decision I ever made in my life. He just popped him with the CAS broke his job. That's a low, that was a, that's comedy. Yeah. It was a, it was crazy. It was ma'am.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       It really was. I uh, I came just behind you guys and one of my big regrets was that I never got to perform with the Ding Ho cause it was so legendary. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:25:29       Because the, the, the, the comics were in charge basically, you know, booking and the, the, all that stuff. So it was, it was, yeah, it was crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       Well that's sort of how the comedy store used to be, except for the booking aspect of it. You know, the comics we were never in charge of, but there was still, but was no real crowd control. There was, it was all comics working. The booth comics would work the door, the comedy store was like, it's all comics working. Well, who's,

Speaker 5:          00:25:53       this was, yeah, this was pretty much mayhem. It's guy a shun Lee. He ran the Ding Ho and a talk to me maybe twice. One night I go out on stage and I'm doing my character and, and you know I'm full board. I write and then I stop and I say, you know, hi, this is my real voice. I'd like to gut and clean some fish tonight. Does anyone have any fish? You know, really straight. I'm saying this in my roommate raises his hand, he pulls out this big fish. Now the fish would Ben in the trunk of his car. So it's rancid. Oh No, I just got the fish and gut end trails and trails all over the stage. And this woman just contact vomit as soon as she smelled it. Just, Oh, so I'm a professional. I put the mic right down to her so you could hear retching over the PA

Speaker 3:          00:26:43       chicks puking up. There's fish gut vomit all over the front of this date. And then I go, thank you. Gonna in the next guy was bill Campbell around when you're this guy, really sweet guy, but his act as you know, talking about, you know, relationships, you know, men go to me, you know? Yeah. It's just gets and fishing. And he goes, uh, you know, so he, his act is destroyed because overbook, this kind of stuff. So, yeah, very nice, wholesome kind of heck. And then I did this and then shun Lee. There's only time, first time he talked to me, he goes, he pulls me over to talk to him. He goes, Bob, are you weird? He said, fuck. Are you weird? Wow. What a great boss. Yeah, yeah. That was, yeah, it was like, I still did the second show. Don't do the fish, you know. No more, no more fish. It's hilarious. But yeah, so it was, I don't know, I was gone by the time it, it, it met its the mice. But when did you bail you out of Boston?

Speaker 5:          00:27:42       I went to San Francisco. It was all pretty quick. You know, I got on Letterman and then, uh, and then I, it was in the early eighties. I can't, you know, really, I was half in and half out of the different cities, San Francisco and Boston. So it was like 82, maybe three.

Speaker 3:          00:27:55       I started in the 88. Oh Wow. So it was way after the Boston comedy scene. When did it really start? When was like the birth? Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:28:03       it was before I got there and I got there at the, uh, like 80, the end of 80 probably.

Speaker 3:          00:28:09       Did you see France Alameda's documentary show? Yeah, I'm a little bit in that. Yeah. Yeah. It tabs, some of it, but there's still stuff that was, uh, that, I mean, he did a great job. Wasn't raw dog.

Speaker 5:          00:28:23       Well, there's just some things in there that, you know, well, the one thing is funny is that I watched that movie with Lemmy clunk and part of the story is that these guys don't like me because I get on Letterman, you know? And that was true. I mean. Oh yeah. And they got really mad because, um, you know, I don't know younger than them. I come in from Syracuse. I again on Letterman, like, you know, probably in a year or so I would have been pissed too. But you know, Lenny would be, you know, and Leonie and I are friends actually were going to do a project together but, but, but at the time when he was really pissed, he was like, you know, he's throwing me into,

Speaker 3:          00:28:56       yeah, not your 10. It was almost like a union gig. It was like you didn't put in your seniority. Yeah. So, so,

Speaker 5:          00:29:07       um, that became part of that movie. But you know, I sat there and watched it with Lenny and, and, and we just kind of laughed together, you know, and, and uh, and I watched it with my daughter too. It was really great for my daughter. It was really cool to have her watch that. Wow. Yeah. I have a pretty good experience. I'll tell a good story if you don't mind. Can we got to go without my daughter? So, um, my daughter is a costumer, she works in commercials and movies and stuff and, and I'm very proud because she's taken a creative life and she, she does great work. We work together and, uh, and, uh, and my wife and I, we work, everybody

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       works. And when I'm making a movie on my friends and family, so, but I get this text from my daughter, she's working on that project and it says, Dad, maybe I shouldn't say it's the one. Oh, I'm going to fuck it. I'm, and so she says, she says, Dad, I have a disaster. Uh, she says as a text, she goes, I have diarrhea. And I went in Russell brand's dressing room and I'm using his toilet. Oh, he doesn't know I'm in here. And he just came back in and she's trapped in the bathroom. I have to go back to the set. She says, what do I do? I go, I go make him feel uncomfortable. Just open the door and go, hi Russell brand. I had to change my tampon shark week. And so, and so my daughter texts back, Deb, you're great. I love you. Oh, she thinks I'm trying to help her out of an uncomfortable situation, but really I'm going, what could I have her say? So Russell brand won't try to fucker.

Speaker 3:          00:30:39       Ah, ah, so, uh, because of course I'm going, oh, this is bad, this is bad. The bathroom being cute with the hitting the charges are, yeah, I mean, you know, and that's his thing, you know, and then I'm like, and then I go, what happened? And he goes, she was napping. And I'm like, my feelings are hurt too. I'm like, well, he didn't try it yet, which makes me a creep but weird in it. What was the motivation for making this big foot movie? Cause this is like completely for me. I mean, I, I found out about this like three weeks ago. Okay. And when, and also folks who, if they are familiar, a lot of folks don't make, I make movies but, but the, the, it's, it's completely different than like world's greatest dad and God bless him man. It's a lot different than shakes.

Speaker 3:          00:31:25       Fucking great. Oh, thanks man. So fucking great movie. Tom Kenny and I, who, whose name drop is now the voice of Spongebob is binky the clown in the movie. And he's again, cocaine. He's doing San Francisco startup. But I've known Tom since I was six. We were introduced by a crying nun at St Matthews. Well, we weren't introduced. Tommy tells the story better, but he says his fat kids dragged behind this nun who's just sobbing. And she, she dragged me into his classroom and goes, cause we were in two different first grades. She's like, I can't take him anymore. And she left me in this class and I was so, I felt horrible. I was so embarrassed. I started crying too. But, but he thought it was cool that I can make a nun cry. So he introduced himself at lunch. So that's Larry. We've been now, yeah, we're both the, I'm 51 he'll be 51 in July. But uh, so I, yeah, I've known Tom Kenny. He's binky the clown. Him and I were watching a shake. They showed shakes and people recently, and people showed up as characters and they know the dialogue and there's clown whores. They're, these women were just as slutty clowns. And in the middle of it, when he leans over to me, he goes, what the fuck were we thinking?

Speaker 3:          00:32:38       And the crowd was really even matter. If it was like that Shatner sketch on Snl, you know, we were like, get a life, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:32:43       we were really wigged out by that. But you know, if you make a movie, you better be willing to talk about it. Oh yeah. Because even my small indie films that I do under the radar, and they play festivals, you're going to talk about them for the rest of your life, so you better kind of stand by it. And that's part of this movie was that I, I've always been fascinated with bigfoot. I've always been super interested in the Patterson Gimlin, uh, footage, you know, and, and so I, uh, it wasn't that long ago, uh, the o nine, she's like saying, she knows me. She goes, go, go, go to your big foot. So I put about 1400 miles on the car and just in California, just driving around famous sites, talking to different people until I made it all the way up to Willow Creek, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:33:27       And so you did this just to sort of form the idea in your head. Yeah. Well, I wasn't, I didn't have a move. I had a different movie in my head, which I still think I'll write because I thought it, I, one of the things that's fascinating about Sasquatch is, is it's a, it's a good, everybody, I wanted to do a thing that kind of, uh, this isn't this movie, but I had an idea for a movie that kind of took on faith and religion and everything, and I thought maybe I'd set it in the Sasquatch community because there's people that just believe, and there's people that believe and see, there's people that are shysters just people. I mean, so it's a really good, uh, it, you know, it's a good analogy for religion, but, um, you know, uh, I don't know where you sit on the pointy head or less pointy headed big foot.

Speaker 3:          00:34:13       What I funny. Yeah. It's funny because I saw this guy go over to another guy at a conference and the guy's got a cardboard egg with a big pointy headed bigfoot. And the guy goes, you disgust me. And he goes, wait. He goes, look at that head. And so you just got, yeah. And the other two guys

Speaker 5:          00:34:32       really, I've seen big foot three times and you're never going to see him cause you smoke.

Speaker 3:          00:34:39       Yeah. And I was like going, it's pretty gangster.

Speaker 5:          00:34:43       Well this is beautiful. You know, this is really amazing. It's like, so, so subcultures are fascinating to me. I love the fact that, that, that um, uh, you can get into discussions and go down this crazy rabbit holes with everybody. And um, and I, I, I do, I, you know, here's the thing, when you say you believe that means people say you no longer impartial, but I'm going to s but everybody has a, you know, so I, I'm not impartial. I, I do believe that there's, there's a, a Sasquatch out there. Wow. Or, or, or I should say big foot plural.

Speaker 3:          00:35:19       You went there, you said, I believe is a Sasquatch. Yeah. I mean, when I look at my career, what it's going to happen, you could say bobcat goes away. It's weird that that is one of those subjects though where it's like a Ufo woes or psychics or something along those lines. As soon as you start talking about it, you're immediately a silly person.

Speaker 5:          00:35:38       Yeah. But I'm already used silly person. Yeah. I'm so far off the radar. I do what I do. It's completely, you know, I, about seven, eight years ago, I really just Kinda quit. I stopped being in stuff that I was embarrassed of. I stopped, you know, I still do something if it's nice and the breads there, but for the most part I just quit. You know, I stopped trying to get jobs. I didn't want to get discovered. I did, I stopped writing movies for other people that I wasn't getting paid for that I thought they would like or I stopped. I stopped out all of it and I just, and I was, and I was fortunately enough, Jimmy Kimmel hired me to direct the show. And that's a big deal. That's a huge deal because, you know, I mean,

Speaker 4:          00:36:19       you did dispel show a little bit. I did a little Chapelle. We ran into each other and that was three. Yeah, totally random.

Speaker 5:          00:36:27       And, um, so I worked on Chappelle and that, but working for Jimmy, you know, it kind of just gave me this freedom is nice that someone believed in me, you know, when, when pretty much a I'd become still and possibly,

Speaker 4:          00:36:39       well we talked about it before the podcast when the, during the commercials, the thing with the tonight show, that was the big thing with the chair on fire, this persona that people that had an ass load of and, and, and, and just, you know, and, and I didn't even, you know, I got really yeah

Speaker 5:          00:36:53       frustrated because I was just being famous for being famous and this is before then, you know, a digital age. I just got really tired of being like, you have booked me on a talk show, I go crazy and people would be happy and, and I really was just like so over it really destructive, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:37:10       Well you were like rebelling against like the police academy movies and that sort of box that, but also it's,

Speaker 5:          00:37:17       it's, it's rebelling truly. I think the real thing, what was that? I was, you know, Leno was nice enough to have me on and then, and then I saw this pattern that I may have become a regular and, and I've never really discussed this, that terrified me. They did being successful on that level because it's easier to be a guy who never tried and then you're in some dopey teen comedies and you can criticize what everybody else does and be bitter, but they're really put, you know, to really put your cock on the block and say, this is who I am. This is going to be my material, or this is the movies, this is the products that say who I am. That's terrifying because then you're out there to be judged.

Speaker 4:          00:37:54       That's fascinating. So it's almost like get a self destructive quality because completely idea of success was just too much pressure. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:38:00       Because then I'd have to actually pony up and actually, oh, so you've been criticizing x, Y, and z? Well, what, what do you do? You know? So, so, um, I was really trying to not, it was kind of funny because I was trying not to be on TV anymore and I said that the night you have a fire and then immediately I get booked on every show. People think like I was banned from other shows. I wasn't in band from the tonight show. They actually had me on a week later. But, but um, it's, it's, it's very fascinating. It's funny, I was just writing this thing. Um, you know, I toured with Nirvana as a comedian and, and there would be times where, you know, I was, it was a few nights where I was sitting up with curtain, you know, we were exchanging stories like, you know, him showing up and drag in a gown for a headbangers ball and nobody getting that, you know, that's pretty funny.

Speaker 5:          00:38:48       Especially it was funny to him cause he's getting asked to go on a metal show. So he thought it'd be funny to show up and drag and everybody's like going this guy, you know? And especially because he wasn't running around and lipstick on. Wow. You know, he just was comfortable in a drag. So, uh, it was, you know, and he's like, mom, nobody would give him, you know, and it was really funny. And then, and then, you know, like I'd, I'd smashed up the Arsenio Hall show. Did way more damage on that show. I remember that too. Yeah, I wrote paramount sucks on the back of that cause they fired him basically and they gave him a rod deal and it was just me trying to end it, you know, I, I really related more to rock then comics. I just kind of, Ooh, you know, I try to. And then

Speaker 6:          00:39:29       were you upset though that you were like, you, did you feel like you were getting pushed into some like family box and it wasn't representing you? Like it was a real visionary is a real comic that, you know, it's funny. People, you know, I think the character would cloud people from hearing anything I was saying, you know, I love and meet Bob. I got it when it was like a house. I mean, when did it come out? Yeah. I don't know. But yeah, just starting out. That's funny because that album, like people don't, I don't think people understood that I actually had material. I think so just tell me in, in police academy. So what I was going to say, it was a real, it was really good comedy. It was really good. Stand up. And uh, I think a lot of people I remember just thought you were like a crazy actor guy.

Speaker 6:          00:40:12       Like all the people didn't know. Like you didn't just have stand up. You had like really smart stand up. It was really good stuff. But it was weird because I think I helped perpetuate it. Oh Gosh. Ipod was possibly, you know, it's Kinda funny when you go on stage and you do this persona, even people who are rolling their eyes start laughing. So it's hard to jettison it. Especially when you go on the road and they're expecting it. It's weird to get pigeonholed. And I just stopped. Uh, it was, I was on the road and I realized, Oh, I don't dislike, stand up. I hate this fucking care. I did. People try the way, expect it at all. Yeah. And they, you know, still do, you do the voice, you know, and they get mad, you know, but, but it's just, I gotta do I gotta do I gotta be me?

Speaker 6:          00:40:56       You know, as Corny as that sounds, you know, I, I feel you mean you got to quit. You know, you got it. Like there's this weird thing in our society where it's like, uh, you know, you can't quit and, and that's where you find when you're happy, you know, he said, oh, this isn't working for me. You know, I thought, oh, this isn't working for me. So you could end up in a place where you go, oh, this is what's working for you. Unfortunately, ended up, they're usually about 45 well, there's a lot of people that they, they never abandon that act and they hang onto it. Like, just Judy Tenuta still do stand up. I don't, I don't know. She had a great act. It's funny that my wife and I brought it, but he owed nine and I brought Judy Tenuta today

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       on the plane because I did the gathering of the Juggalos. Oh Wow. And, and we're wondering if like, if like they booked the wrong acts on purpose. So we were like putting together a lineup. Like it was going to be Paula Poundstone and Aimee Mann at this year's gathering of the Juggalos. We may cause I think cause sometimes, did you ever see, did you ever see the public sex wouldn't be gathering the juggle? There's a movie called, uh, shoot American juggle. I think his name. No, I've just watched clips on the Internet. No, they just have you sought Tila Tequila get hit with Pooh. Did she really? Yeah, man. Through pooler he ran out of Phaco Cola. So they, so they started throwing poo and oh my God. Like dudes were shitting and what cops know, they knocked over, they backed out to report upon. Yeah. It wasn't like GGL I may ask someone else's pool.

Speaker 3:          00:42:26       Yeah. Which is, that's my point. Look, uh, I'm going to digress here. Ball. That's her on stage. And that's Rowan Porter, right? Like hypothetically. Let's say you are, I, I give it up. I mean, look, she, she, oh, pull it stays in them. She, she stays up there. Oh Jesus, that shit just hit her legs. I love that. She's like sitting there going, you know what, a couple more minutes I'm going to win her back late. She just lay that I gotta give it up. Grab her crotch. Is that all shit or is it some of the beer? No, it's Phaco Cola. They, it's the soda. They like the throw. But um, like if, here's my point, if you are walking down the street and, and you hit me with dog poop, right? Like you saw some and threw it, it wouldn't be a deal breaker, but I'd be mad. I'd be like, Joe, what the fuck was that?

Speaker 3:          00:43:14       And you go, I don't know. I thought it was funny. We laugh it off. No, but if you hit me with like, you know, like Hobo, do you know what I mean? Like poof, from a person that would be the deal breaker. I'd be like, you fucker, I'm gonna have to see in my, I now really swift human shit is way more terrifying. Did you ever see Gigi Allen? Uh, yeah. And then he starts throwing it at people and they get out of their way. Like, like, like military striping, like when people have about human poo is way worse. It's terrifying. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. So I did that. I just hose it off. Ah, yeah. But I did the, yeah, the gathering of the Juggalos and, and um, and in, uh, the, uh, the opening act upchuck uh, the clown is trying to calm my nerves now there's, there's no, you know, they have their, their, their own security. So there's no security. It's just, it's just juggle a law on this huge piece of property. Wow. So, and there's so, it was just madness. Yeah. There's fires going on and fire work. People are always lighting fire to like fireworks, like the way people light cigarettes. Like casually. I don't, I saw a lot of that was really funny. Like where people don't jump out the way. It's like

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       some bath salts. You wandered around amongst his be, are they freaking out? No, because, um, I think, well, they know that sometimes I get recognized for the most part I don't get recognized. But, but, but it was, you know, we took a golf cart through the whole thing. And like I said, there's fights and people, I don't know what they're doing, but maybe you might know what this is, but suddenly people would drop, like there'd be like a group of people and then you just see him drop. Like, like they were puppets in someone cut their strings. They just hit them like his own, they're cheering graph thing like their Joan. Oh No, no, like whatever they had been doing, we just suddenly, like a bunch of them would just drop. Yeah. It'd be like three or four of them. Obviously they just ingested or did something.

Speaker 5:          00:45:12       And then I'll send you Jim go, don't get the done like dominoes and then they get up. I don't know what that, whatever it is is not good. Yeah. Well, well, so, so, so, so, you know, it's, it's, I understand the idea of the Juggalos by the way. I get it. You know, I get it. It's a, it's a certain sec that's, that's pissed off. And it's certain group of people and I, and, and they, and they do have the sense of community and family. I do, I do try to be open minded. And they were, and by the way, they were very nice to me, I should say that it's a very good way of putting that. But, but while we were there, you know, up checks trying to convince me that it's not that scary of a Gig and he's driving me around on this golf cart and he's like, you know, you got to it and this huge cloud just everybody's kind of either, some guys are cut and clown makeup.

Speaker 5:          00:46:02       I is, a lot of them are, uh, or like obese, you know, men and women. It's really like an incest survivors convention. Like, you know, nobody's going to touch me anymore, you know. So this guy just jumps out of nowhere and starts punching up chuck on the golf guy. He's running along and for no reason. He's like, fuck you, fuck you up. And he's gutting it. And the guy said, we lose the guy. And he's like, ah, ah, I'm here every year. You know, they know me, I'm like family. And I'm like, okay. So, so then he punched him in the face, punched him right in the face, and then he took it like, like in the shoulder. And then, and then by the time we gotten him, he got get 'em like one, like in the kidney on the way out, like a left. And he's hitting him hard.

Speaker 5:          00:46:45       Yeah. Yeah. Real punches. Real punches. Jesus. So, so, and that was Columbia. It was a little smudge. He's trying to, he's trying to convince me this can affect the first kind of fake what comes in and it just sprays all over us. And uh, and he's like, uh, he's so familiar with getting hit with Vaco Cola. He goes, he goes, uh, uh, it's diet. It's not going to stay. I swear to God he really said that Larry. And then one comes in and, and, and uh, the o nine, he's got it on camera. She had a sports setting on her, on her camera set. The shutter is like faster. So we've got this shot. It's like the Zapruder film. We got this can of soda. This guy does a baseball

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       pitch and you see it whizzing seconds before it hits them right in the temple, no car rack. And he just slumped over and he goes, uh, lumps over the wheel and he goes, I'm hurt. I'm hurt bad by the way, he's mid sentence because you know something like that, when the soda is that going to happen at a Dave Matthews come rack and he slumped. So I was like, I'm hurt. I'm hurt bad Bob. He's calling me Bob, so I know he's really fucked up, not five. And I think he was out for a second. Oh my God. So he hits, he hits the gas and now, yeah, that's up chuck. Yeah, that's, it's Joel. And so it was like the golf cart and I was fine. That's crazy. So how old were you when this was going on, by the way? Your sold 1550 years. 50 years old. And so upchuck now full throttle and I'm steering spear and we're whizzing through the crowd, like Mr [inaudible], wild ride, Juggalos kind of. And I, I, uh, and then, oh, oh, do I love this? This is actually beautiful. You know, he was concussed. His eyes were all fucked up. I'm like, God. And he's like, we just went back to the trailer and we're just gonna be really quiet. And then he puts in ice cold vago on his side of his head.

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       He's like, he's going to look, he's like, am I bleeding? I go, I don't know where the makeup starts. Much blood. I don't know what's right fucking can of sooner to the head that, that's hard. Ard. And then I'm not going to, he may or may not, it looked like he was doing some sort of stimulant after that too, because it's, you know, you worried about your safety or this was all, yeah. Yeah. I, uh, once I got it, yeah. You know, and, and by the way, I'm no stranger to hi-jinks, you know, I'm this the man who lit the tonight show couch on fire, you know, my wife says I have good ideas and bad ideas and I don't know the difference. It's just ideas. And I treat them with enthusiasm. I may or may not have lit a quarter stick of dynamite in my backyard. When I lived up, I think it was a half a stick. It was like a for stick. Yeah. And it blew up, um, this watermelon that shot all the way, like three floors up. It was, that's the way it goes in. It gets kind of gory. But I digress. So I'm no stranger, so like something explodes and, and, and, and uh, and my wife goes to set an m 80 and I'm like, no, that's, that's dynamite.

Speaker 3:          00:50:07       Wow. So I go up, hey, where's my party people that, no, I, I actually did a fine set there by the way. Crowd was, you know, one o'clock. I hit the stage. They, they, they, they, you know, they, they liked the tenacity. If you can actually hang their there and I, you know, my oldest brother was a biker, so I'm of familiar

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       with a kind of outlaw behavior. It wasn't, it's never that, um, you know, freaky

Speaker 1:          00:50:33       to me it seems like it's sort of an agreed upon thing at this sort of a place. If you're going to hang out with a bunch of people at a party and there call themselves Juggalos, you know, some sodas going to fly through the air. It's going to be,

Speaker 3:          00:50:44       you can't get mad about soda, but to the point of,

Speaker 5:          00:50:46       but what you see the problem is, is if there is no, uh, there's no law, right. It's a little lord of the flies. Like some dude, they thought he was stealing so they physically, I don't know what happened to him, but they tore his car park, like, just dismantled it. Whoa. Yeah. So it's a little, little lord of the flies.

Speaker 3:          00:51:07       Yeah. I mean, I would've got paid in a plastic trash bag full of 20s that's actually kind of bad ass. Yeah. And then, uh, and then,

Speaker 5:          00:51:18       and then the cops had just at the lip, just, just, just taking people to jail. They had a bus. So you, so we pull out right in the cabs are gone. What's going on? I go, look, I got a bag full of money. Bob. Get cold

Speaker 3:          00:51:31       comedian. I was big in the 80s you know, they're like, yeah, you know, nothing weird. You guys, whatever you want to do, I'm completely straight. And they were, they actually found that really funny. That is funny. So they were looking for people to be drunk and then you opened up my bag of money and they're like, I should do comedy, you know, and they're all busted my chops. But yeah. Would they looking for drunk drivers or, oh, just raw hide out of their minds. Anything. I mean they were just popping everybody that pulled out of the this

Speaker 1:          00:51:59       street there. I love what you said about the, uh, about it being like community and the, there's of positive things to that.

Speaker 5:          00:52:06       There. There is so, so I mean, like I tell this story and I laugh and stuff, but was it any different than when I went to see the almond brothers with my brother Tommy, and he was tripping on acid and his brother, his brother Biker, who is still still alive, big bitch. Uh, we, uh, who is a green baret and we're going to see the almond brothers and he suddenly, thanks everyone

Speaker 3:          00:52:28       ready? Going into the concert is Charlie. Oh my God. It was the best that, what year was this?

Speaker 5:          00:52:35       Uh, probably like 78. Oh my God. And I'm just like, oh. And you know, sometimes when things go crazy. That's the other thing about me when during mayhem and chaos, I'm actually super calm. It's pretty cozy. You've been around it so many times, but like everyday life we'll, we'll flip me out. [inaudible] like we, you're talking to her, know the line in the post office. I can't handle correctly. I get upset and stuff, but, but may ham I get really calm. Really? Yeah. Like a deer jumped out in front of us when we're up in willow creek and I just said my wife, I go, just stopped the car.

Speaker 3:          00:53:15       I can all send Daddy. I Dunno. It was pretty much

Speaker 1:          00:53:18       other than the other way. Yeah. Yeah. But the, the, I know what you're talking about, about freaking out about lions and stuff like that. If he, if you can't just stand still and relax, you know, like in a line and then, then the nicest slow. It's probably like an ADHD thing when people are actually really freaking out.

Speaker 5:          00:53:36       Well, it's the, it's the, it's the, you know, the whole nine caused me a, a misanthrope and I think that is not correct because I think what upsets me is I actually kind of have, I think I, I tried to think the best. I really do. Even though I make movies where I'm shooting people and you know, and, and, and, and all these weird things, I do kind of give people the benefit of doubt. I truly do. When she said that she's, she goes, you're missing throw up. And I said, you only say that because you're a person.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       She's always afraid that I'm going off the grid because at night she calls it the, at my lake porn,

Speaker 5:          00:54:16       she comes in and says, what are you looking at? And it's just me looking at like 80 acres. How Lake? Yeah, it's got its own at home. It's going to creek.

Speaker 1:          00:54:25       Oh, you looking at like houses and get the generator going. Oh yeah, go off the grid, dude. You and me. I think about that shit all, it's off the grid. Just squash all day. Just watching. Just set up a few gifting boxes. Now you went swatching lear show him doing, is it, did you start it? Yeah, the show started airing. It starts airing July 16th on the Scifi channel. It's called Joe Rogan questions everything. And one of them is big foot. I've had a big foot fascination since I was a little kid when I was a little kid. I was camping the Pacific northwest with my Stepdad. And there's a dude who was up there. He was a trapper and he had like these animal skins and shit. He was killing animals like bobcats, which I didn't think it was kind of creepy at the time. I think that's really creepy. I was only seven. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:55:10       no, no, no. I met me. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:55:13       But, uh, and he told me about, you know, that these, all these people have had these big foot like, uh, experiences up there. And the way he was describing it, I barely remember. It's like a really whispery memory. But I remember that's what started me off on then I start, I was always in the monsters and shit when I was a little kid. I loved horror movies. So then I started like reading up on pig foot and then I watched the Patterson footage. Eventually I saw, uh, in search of

Speaker 5:          00:55:37       and search of is the one that everybody around and said, did you see boggy creek? Because that was all women. So that, that I think that had a boggy creek. I didn't go back and revisit it, but I think that movie probably had a lot to do with my movie Willow Creek. Actually,

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       I got addicted to that show finding bigfoot two of you, uh, if you want. Sure. Or

Speaker 5:          00:55:56       actually a cliff and Bobo showed up. I showed the movie up, I went back up. I went, yeah, I showed it to the folks that are in it because you know, a lot of actual um, uh, folks from the big four community or in the movie. I mean, and, and uh, and how, how can we sell this movie? I mean, I'm just starting to play and just started playing festivals. Thing that I'm really happy is big foot folks seem to really like it. Like cliff said, this is the best big foot movies ever saying, listen, this is a great horror,

Speaker 6:          00:56:24       fun movie. It's a great fun movie. Yeah. And I don't, I try not to be cheesy and, oh no, I didn't want, I didn't want those guys. Didn't talk too much about this movie because I don't want to give any of it away because I want people to see it. It's, it's you or me. It's, I think it's, Oh, can I tell you when, when things quickstar yeah, sure. I'm having a blast. Thanks for having me. Thanks for being on. I'm having a bus too. So you've got that, that the American Werewolf in London. I love that movie. Yeah, me too. I, yeah, so that blew my mind when I saw it. Now where did you get that? Is that from, this is a guy named Pat Mcgee. He's a special effects guy and he does a, he designs, if you go to Magee [inaudible] dot com he designs a couple different things. Like he does an alien, like from the movie alien, and he just reconstructs life life size replica. It's crazy. Yeah. He's really, he's got a mold and he uses Yak hair and it's incredible.

Speaker 3:          00:57:21       Many, I don't know if you've ever heard this myth, but one of the many myths about the Patterson Gimlin footage is that it's John Landis in the suit. Have you ever heard that? No, I haven't heard that. Okay. So, so, so I've heard this and I that and so one morning I and, and I, and I love American Werewolf. I love John, like animal house and all that stuff. I mean that was John Landis is of course brilliant. So, but I don't know him. So I get a hair up my ass and I'm like, Oh and I got to get to the bottom of this. So I shoot my agent an email and I say, I've got this idea for a TV show for John Landis myself. It's a total lie. I said, can you get me his email? And so she gets me his email. So I write him an email and I'm going to read it to you cause it cause so he and I had this exchange and I say, Hi John, I'm writing an article about the Patterson Gimlin footage.

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       I'm not just lying. So He's, thank God he's a nice guy and was wondering would you be kind enough to let me interview? Okay. So I go on and on and I said, I want to clear up the rumors that John Chambers made the suit and that you were wearing it so quickly. I get this email back, Deere, bobcat. I am definitely not the guy in the big foot suit in the parish. And Kim would footage. What publication are you writing an article for? How did you get my email address? It's funny, but I sent him back and I, and, and, and we went back and forth and, and uh, he was really cool actually. He, he, he, I think he's probably tired of answering that question, but I'm sure one of his early, he did a great movie. A, it's like a, it's called schlock where he's in a gorilla suit. You've probably seen it. Is it like a gorilla with a space helmet on? No, and it's, it's a kind of famous damage and it's him directing the movie. I love the in the gorilla suit with this space. So it really, yeah, cause I got a great, I love this. There's a photo of me directing shakes the clown and I, and I'm in a clown suit and I've just, I'll never be in

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       something I direct again, you know, and I'm like fucking, you know, I'm like dead serious and everyone's laughing and I look like such an ass. So no sense of humor. I'm fucking clown suit. So it's called Schlock. Schlock. Yeah. Never heard of it. Yeah. Let me double check. But yeah, it is called Schlock. Uh, but so I'm a, I'm a big fan. I wasn't coming from a, again, yeah. It's like I wasn't coming from a big snarky place. I, I sincerely fan of land is and stuff. But I thought there's a lot of big foot rumors that I kind of thought, well, maybe I can use, you know, my connections. Not that I have connections, but you know, I could just prove some of the things, you know, like, like get into the John Chambers suit. You know, John Chambers is the guy who was an Argo who did the planet of the apes. You know, there's a rumor that he may have built the suit and he did make a big foot, but his big foot I've seen in a, it's a, you know, so, so whatever it is, a rabbit hole,

Speaker 4:          01:00:11       well it's a rabbit hole, but it's also a rabbit hole where a guy says he did it. His name's Bob Herat homeless. He walks just like that. He took a lie detector test and passed. He also was a con man. So is Robert Patterson and Robert Patterson also went to jail for writing a bad check. Pay for the very camera that found that footage.

Speaker 5:          01:00:29       Yes. And you go even deeper. Excellent. Because the con men, look, my thing about my belief in the pants and footage, it boils down to the gate. It really does. It boils down to that knee in that leg. And you've been listening to a bunch of nuts.

Speaker 4:          01:00:45       Trust me. That's a guy in a monkey suit. Let's, let's play it. Let's play it. We'll go over it. They guy, it's a guy with a football pad, football shoulder pads on explaining this. Okay. I'm not confronting you. I know, but why it, this is just a more, this isn't like proof, but this is a weird thing. Why did they go to the trouble to get it? Find that stabilized one. There's a stabilized one. It's better. Why did they, um, that was, uh, Abraham Zapruder who shot that too. He does one. Look, there's a couple of things you'd be noticed. I want to, I want people to pay attention. When you watching it, why does it have breasts? That to me is the weirdest thing. Why doesn't have that breath? Why did they couldn't make a suit like that in that time? And why would they take the [inaudible] and there wasn't for sure if the stretch fabric that looked like for it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:32       I'm not sure if that's entirely true to a lot of knuckleheads. And I also think that it's ridiculous to say why would they make that looks like a [inaudible] listening to a lot of dingbats. That's what you'd been queer whack a. Do you look at it? Move. That is a man that is that a man not compelling to me. That looks like it's a man. Are you serious? Yeah. The Gate looks like a dude with a big load and he's wearing a diaper. I was going to football shoulder pads on. It's all fucked up. Stupid outfit and I think you're looking at it from, uh, you know the problem is, here's the problem. I can mind. Fuck myself. The problem is we play it back over again. I'd go, that's fucking real. Yeah, man. Look at the CAF. I'll look them in the cat's ass. Back it up a little bit. Let's watch it again. I'll try to, I'm going to try to mind fuck myself here. Like a mind. Fuck myself. Ready? Oh my God. I think it's real now. See if I can, when it goes back and forth like that, that's the only, you got to play Yakety Sax. Look at that. At eight eight, eight, eight Benny Hill goes out and slaps, looking at walk, let's, let's, let's zoom and stabilize on the big foot.

Speaker 4:          01:02:41       That's a kind of monkey suit. I wish I could mind fuck myself, but I can't. I try. I try, but it looks so stupid. It's so funny to you. Slightly longer hands like he's probably got some artificial hands in the suit. And if you watch this, look up Bob Herana mess, but his walking, there's some footage of canyon fascinates split screen with Bob Herana Miss Walking on one side of the screen and the Sasquatch and it, goddammit Bob [inaudible]. This was a big gangly Sasquatch looking motherfucker. Let's take a look. And he passed the lie detector test, but that's not, but I mean when the guy walks like a duck, quacks like a duck story. So many times he started believing it's possible he made Oj Simpson the whole thing. I think you can do that too. I believe it a hundred percent a hundred percent I'm gonna believe what my memory of my childhood is.

Speaker 4:          01:03:30       So God damn foggy, you know, I could go one way or another way. And start telling a story about it one way and then by the time I get 10 years down the line, don't even fucking remember what really happened. Your childhood is so bananas now to you. Have you, do you spend time trying to piece it together or you move past it? What do you mean? Well, I mean it's pretty nuts. The moving around, and I've heard you talk about it in the past, but do you around was nuts. But the really nutty thing was the martial arts competing and going and competing in martial arts tournaments throughout my high school years. That was the nuttiest thing cause I was, I was a child and I was having martial arts competitions against grown men. Like my, my, my instructor was crazy and he made me fight grown man when I was 15 so like from the time when I was 15 till I was 21 all I did was full contact martial arts tournaments.

Speaker 4:          01:04:17       That was way scarier than anything. It was almost like I was so scared of growing up and I was so scared of being an adult and I was so scared of just interacting with people and fitting in in any place. Cause I was always the new kid and always moving. I was so scared of fitting in that I just decided to do something way harder than that. So I didn't have to think about that. I tried to do the most obscure, crazy, scary thing to me. Well, why did, it's really weird. Uh, now it's, it's kind of sad to hear this. No, it's not sad. It worked out great. Well, sad is if I had to go back and be myself as a child was often sad as a child, but ultimately it worked out, you know? I mean, it's not sad to go through tough experiences and develop character. I don't think that's sad, you know? I mean, I think there's a lot of people who came out of a lot worse than me. Like I, it was fun at the comedy come about. That's the part the company came about from a gallows humor, from going to tournaments. I used to make my friends laugh in the locker room. It would make my friends laugh like on buses and planes and shit. I would

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       be the guy who was like trying to crack the ice cause we were all terrified and I wasn't insecure around them. Like the guys that are trained with it was the probably the first time in my life I felt confident enough to like talk out about things and say [inaudible] joke about things and not to get told to shut the fuck up or someone's gonna kick my ass or you know, that's what a lot of moving from town to town when you're the new kid it's like you always have to defend yourself. You're always dealing with the local bully. And it's like it was because it's a constant thing. So when I started doing martial arts, like this guys all knew me so I was comfortable around them. So then I would make fun of Shit to sort of lighten the tension because everybody was scared. Cause when you go to tournaments it was just fear. The bus was filled with fear and everyone's scared. Weighing in is scary. And then every now and then one of us would get knocked the fuck out. You get head kicked and Ah, and you deal with your friend. Just got to cut cost in the thing that you

Speaker 6:          01:06:06       do for zero money bus, go back in the bus and get an ice pack on his head. I get black eyes and shows around. Do you call the family

Speaker 1:          01:06:14       [inaudible]? I was the only child. Wow. Yeah, until you know, some kids came along when I was like 19 and 20. There was some kids that joined up. There was like 17 and 18 but for the longest time I was really young. Have any social life? Did you have zero zero, no party and no drinking, no nothing. I had a couple of friends from high school and uh, my best friends actually went to the school. That was the other school.

Speaker 6:          01:06:36       And what about, what about women? Did you have girlfriends at all? I had a girlfriend, almost ruined me, my first girlfriend because as soon as they're starting to having sex, I just didn't want to train anymore. I was like, it was like, why would I go, Gee, this is way more fun. Does everybody know about this? Yeah, it was ridiculous. I was like, the sex is way better than martial arts. Like getting my face. But I think, yeah, having my nose shoved into my brain, it was always, um, all right, so we were talking about Paris said before, I, I don't suddenly became a shrink on you if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. Okay. I want you to watch this. This is Bob or autonomous walking and then the big foot Bob looking at turning just like the big foot.

Speaker 6:          01:07:20       I mean, come on man. Put that guy in the goddamn monkey suit. It was a mistake that the knees aren't shown here. Honestly. I mean, if you look at the knees and the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the way the calf goes up. You ever walk with Ice Skates on? Uh, yeah. Well, you know how ice Kate's don't bend. Right? And when you had to pick them up and be fucking exaggerated walking motion. What he did with the big foot looks like to me is like a dude with like a suit on. It's got like crazy feat on the suit and he has to walk a certain way because they will then, you know, it's funny, I know I'm not giving way too much about the movie, but there's, there's, there is footprints in the movie. Yeah. So when we say that you shouldn't have said, oh really? Yeah. Stop. Stop right now. Make people, because there's so much about this movie. It's so bad ass. If your movie sucked, I'd let you keep talking, but you're moving to goods from you. Let me shoot myself. God Damn it. Don't do it. So

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       I'm just here to plug hot to trot tonight. It would be beautiful if a guy who's a con man just happened to be the first guy to actually see big foot and filming it would be,

Speaker 5:          01:08:26       well don't you feel that way about being a comedian now? You went out and, and, and where did you go? This is the area we're not going to fake anything. No, no, no. But I mean, but if you find something there, uh, Joe Rogen, you know? Yeah, no, absolutely. Well, I feel about it like, like, like, um, I'm going up to Oregon with a, and, and talking to cliff and we're going to go out, but, but I also feel like I tainted, you know, the idea that, you know, if, if we find anything,

Speaker 4:          01:08:54       I don't think so. I think if you, you're just like me and I think you're, you're feeling about it is genuine. You know? I think it's a fascinating subject. It's very popular, let's say bullshit. But it's also very possible that it's not all out and say it's, it's, it's, it is fake.

Speaker 5:          01:09:10       Okay. What is it about the subconscious through thousands a year is that people continually see these things. I mean, why is it, you know, and, and Teddy Roosevelt, it tells a story of, of a, you know, why does it keep showing up?

Speaker 4:          01:09:24       Okay. Finish that. Teddy Roosevelt told his story in his book that he was unaware. A guy killed a wild man. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:09:32       Yeah. And everything was destroyed. But so like all these stories that keep cars showing up. I know I'm interested too in that, like what? What is it in part of our subconscious? What part of, why do these archetypal characters keep showing up then it happens to be a man in the woods going to be simply is keep your kids away from bears or, or is it something bigger

Speaker 4:          01:09:54       or is it a, is it a, is it an 800 pound wood ape? I mean, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's all fascinating. There's so many different things to consider when you say something like that. It was like, first of all, you have to consider, that's probably a conglomeration of a bunch of things and one of those things being that everyone's afraid of the unknown. And when you look out into that dark woods and you just said, what the fuck is out there?

Speaker 5:          01:10:14       You said that exact getting creeped out for the first time, by the way. And I was in the woods a little 17 miles down a dirt road. Ooh, you know, your 11 hours from La North. Then we go to Willow Creek, then you'd drive about 40 minutes to Orleans name, you drive up this road. Then we'd drive two and a half hours down a 17 mile dirt road to get to the location. So there's no phones, there's no planes going over to mountain lions, whoa. To mountain lions to, and I put the actors in the tent and that scene and they're going, hey man, why are we here man? We could do this in a parking lot. No, because uh, it was, uh, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:10:56       it feels fucking real. There's nothing, don't say more. Okay. You said some shit, but the fucker stop talking about it. But it is,

Speaker 5:          01:11:05       I am happy that people like it, that it is scary, that there's laughs and um, uh, it was the most fun I had making a movie going down a

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       dark road and getting into the woods or the Pacific northwest. It will give you this, this new appreciation of how ridiculously wild that area is. Like the idea that we have an accurate account.

Speaker 5:          01:11:27       Did you get like a buzz when you start the front of the tree trees? There is right, or am there's a female moon beam. I mean there, there are energy, trees are alive, but the oxygen that they make you get, you get like this weird buzz. I was not frighten. Everybody else was kind of frightened. Um, and uh, and I was just like, I, I, I didn't realize this about myself. I just like dropped my trout. I'm walking around my funder where the river, is that where you want to get a lake house? Yeah. Or even, I'm fine with a river. Watch him. That's what you're doing. You want to go up there and go scratches. Yeah, man. And, and, and uh, I don't want to dis, I don't, I'm not a prepper. I don't like that attitude. I really don't because it's like I don't like these preppers. It's like this weird end of times a Christian Judeo bs that they're buying into. Do you know what I mean? The world, if we've learned anything about the world, it's not going to go out with one big bang. You know, it's just like, you know, things are going to fall apart, but it's not going to be anarchy. I don't know why so many people in every movie is about, you know, a scientologist saving the world.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       We've been through several of those and history. I think we're better at understanding it now because we have the written word and we have history. We have all these different stories of the past of civilizations that have deteriorated back when people didn't really have access to books and knowledge,

Speaker 5:          01:12:53       some weird sort of hopelessness. That's, that's, that's, that's, and I don't buy it. I don't, I don't, I don't, I think, I think, um, I think human beings are so resilient and uh, uh, or there is the Carlin bit, you know, maybe, maybe the earth need plastic,

Speaker 1:          01:13:08       you know, like as us, that's fine as a species. I mean, um, I think that we probably will carry on, but it's really easily conceivable that some natural disaster could happen that could wipe out most of the population of earth. All you need is one big you could Tom sized media that hits true and we're done. And there's hundreds of thousands of those floating around. Not like three of them,

Speaker 5:          01:13:32       but I'm not, I think I'm more of an optimist I think. I think when you, you, when you just prep and decide to go underground, I want to go out in the woods because I like, I liked the quiet, I like the smells. I like beautiful. Yeah. But everybody else with me was just completely flipped out of there. But it's like this intern, there's just a tiny crew and he's like, hey man, what's his different suite of bobcat? Uh, what did you see these men, a mountain lion. We said two of them were one and willow creek just walking across the street and then one car or were you drawing a con for the one? But the other one was right where we were filming and, uh, and he goes, hey man, uh, bobcat and a mountain

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       lion. What's the difference? I go bobcat stocky and, um, you know, he's got like a short tail and a mountain lions tall and it's got a long tail. He's like, yeah, I saw a mountain lion that I go where? And I'm like, I'm like, you know, this is like a, um, Verner Herzog making Fitzcarraldo I'm like out of my mind and I go where he goes to the left, I go to the right fellows, you know, just

Speaker 6:          01:14:35       there's a real problem with them not allowing them to hunt mountain lines anymore. Mountain lions I'd find out later on our bad ass. Well, well here's the thing, they're cats. So if you run your 200 pound mouse, you know what I mean, it's just going to take you down. Yeah. Well they go after people on bikes for that very reason. They cannot help themselves a mouse. Yeah. And so like it's

Speaker 3:          01:14:56       you on a bike with a light is a laser pointer. And so, so I was like, how close were you guys? About five feet and if you've ever seen him by the way? Um, well cause the one I did see, and I have big balls, I was in a car, but the one I saw

Speaker 5:          01:15:14       was huge. It's a lion and they just walk. And there he was walking with a purpose across the road, like,

Speaker 6:          01:15:21       like I'm sure he's about to eat some real problem in California's banned hunting of them in some places have banned use of dogs. You need dogs to Huntington's, otherwise you'll never find what happens to the Doug's. I mean, the dogs bathed them, they bark, they get him up a tree and then the new person comes along as the shoots him. Sometimes dogs get attacked though. And that was part of that story and that's it. I'm not so happy about that either. But now when you went in the woods, did you have a gun? There was a guy with us had a gun. Yeah. Everybody kept saying, Oh, you got a gun. And that was

Speaker 3:          01:15:48       gun around my nose. I know, I know. I would never know right now. I know. I had a, we had a ranger with us and, and uh, he's out. So, uh, yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:15:57       he, he's a, a big foot, uh, Robert Lederman a ranger and he's, uh, uh, I'd say big foot enthusiasts. He's really sweet guy.

Speaker 5:          01:16:05       Huge help on the movie actually. And, um, and, you know, it's like three, four in the morning and he's like, you know, uh, I'm a writer too. And I go, oh, really good. What are you? Ray Goes, we, you know, twilight, like a Yankees. I write tween a tween novel set in the big foot world. It's a coming of age story.

Speaker 6:          01:16:27       Twilight was too big for fall in love.

Speaker 3:          01:16:29       Young, young, big foot, big foot falls in love with a person. I know people fall in love in the world. I go, what's the name? He's like Yeti or not at this point. I know. And I'm like, I go, this is, this is my air hose. You know, like this guy is the only thing keeping me alive tonight.

Speaker 6:          01:16:53       Yeah. You're not, oh God. That was very, I was very happy that he liked the movie again. You know, these were folks, uh, in the community. Yeah. Steven stuff for a up in, um, uh, bigfoot books. If you saw that in the movie, he's, the last thing I'm going to say about it, that shower the house was

Speaker 4:          01:17:10       very authentic. It's like I've heard the sounds that they surrender oddly connect with the how. That's the thing, like you listened to that stuff too. Okay. Let's forget the Patterson Gimlin footage. There's so much stuff. Oh No, no, no, I don't. I don't think there's no evidence of big foot exists and I don't think the big foot doesn't exist. I think that the Patterson gave him a hoaxer. A guy's a bullshit artists. I met people when I was up in the Pacific northwest that knew the Patterson Patterson and knew the other dude too. Bob, give him Herandez. Oh, oh. Herana miss. The guy wore a suit and they said, those guys are bullshit artists. They're always trying to make money, and he'd been trying to do it for a long time. They'd had someone else make a suit. They had had to someone else make a suit and it didn't work, and so they had this city who made that suit?

Speaker 4:          01:17:53       Then the fuck knows. But you know, why is it amazing suits not that good. Here's the problem, everybody. This is one of them. Everybody wants to say that it's really good, but here's what's realistic. It's blurry as fuck, so you're not getting a real accurate, crisp version of what you're seeing. You're getting this smushy version of it and so everybody wants a tribute it to muscles and this movement to like, there's no design, no costume like that. I would buy that if you would show me a high resolution, crystal clear video of what we're looking at, but you're looking at blurry trees. The trees look blurry is fuck. You can't make out the very specific branches or the texture of the bark. So what you're looking at when you're saying that the look so good, you look into this blurry thing. That might be tits.

Speaker 4:          01:18:35       That might be a flaw in the costume. That might be his ass or it might be he's wearing a fucking diaper. You're a gorilla suit. I'm leaving. No, no, I think pull it out again. Let's watch it one more time. I want to get back to the breath stabilized. I always think that's very weird. It's my, it's weird, but it's not, it's not an impossible to fake charity. It's not, maybe, well, here's the thing. Okay, how about this? Maybe they, they would feel like big foot is way larger than a person. So you just pretend to be a female big foot. Cause Bob Hieronymus is six foot five. He's too small to be a Sasquatch. So they give him tits. That's way more likely than they filmed bigfoot.

Speaker 4:          01:19:15       Right. It's way more lard. But you say that now. What big foot do you, uh, what evidence do you buy that there's a lot of things that are interesting. First of all, the footprints with the dermal ridges. That's fascinating because that's incredibly difficult to fake. See, I'm looking at that man. You know, there's, that's so blurry. Look how blurry everything is. It's all washed out. Look at that tree. You don't know what the fuck that tree really looks like. You can't see shit. You can't see anything. We'll get all the bad version one. Looking at the best version you can get, man. It's just blown up when you're looking at everything in the distance. You want him shot on red? No Laszlo Kovacs to be the DP dude. Be Honest. Look at the trees you're looking at in front of, they want to look at the trees in front of them.

Speaker 4:          01:19:56       You can't even see any definition of hazard trees there in meal penalties right now. And, and it says beyond that, he says, I'm out of here. Show was that looks real to me. Jesus Christ. You're crazy. One more time. But look at where you're looking at. You're looking at incredibly blurry shit. You're looking at incredibly blurry trees that are all washed out and everyone trying to attribute all this musculature and definition. You barely know what you're looking at here. Why does this hold up so much? Doesn't why foot world, it doesn't hold up. It's just a full, a film that has not been authenticated or or refuted. It just hasn't been. Cause science hasn't really spent any fucking time examining. What about bigfoot that what the Yeti in Russia, the Russians spent a lot of time examining. They were fucking with us. Okay. It still limits real let them was third time. So we start time on this evidence that if you're so pose ridges are fascinating. That's fascinating. The Melba catch DNAs fascinating on the show. We just had a genetic but that, yeah, but that's the stuff that people could be bullshit are calling bs on. It could be. But the dealers though, this guy was a geneticist that overlooked the data and it was his conclusion based on his understanding of genetics. There's a fame. He was a, like an accomplished geneticist, but

Speaker 5:          01:21:24       published in any real thing other than their own.

Speaker 4:          01:21:28       No. That's because they couldn't get published. And we're so far down. No snow. It's good. It's a good thing. That's the letter footage. This is like,

Speaker 5:          01:21:36       this is when, uh, the o nine checks out.

Speaker 4:          01:21:39       No, it's, look, it's, it's a fascinating subject. Wrong. This Melba catch a women or if it's a hoax, but when a geneticist says that he finds the, the information to be compelling, then I have to listen because I'm too fucking stupid to understand who's right or who's wrong.

Speaker 5:          01:21:54       Do you ever see any of the story of Jimmy Stewart with the Yeti finger? Jimmy Stewart? Yeah. He's, he's muddled that what was supposed to be a Yeti finger of, uh, the Himalayas. Uh, and his wife's underwear. Not, she wasn't, it wasn't in her pants but I mean in her underwear. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:22:16       Honey, you going to have to keep this in your pussy. Yeah. It was just important to any finger. It's hard getting weed and it needs to be moist.

Speaker 5:          01:22:25       No it wasn't. It was in her, in her underwear drawer and they got it all the way to England. Now that has been proven not to be a Yeti thing. I can't remember, but I remember that it had DNA testing done to it. Jimmy Stewart at Yeti. I, you know, you know, um, you know, what really works for me is a lot of the, the, the audio recordings will obviously, cause you were talking about that in the movie and, and that is what works for me is, is, is, you know, I love listening to them. I think it's funny you were talking about Ufos. I think it's funny. It's like people will go, where's the footage? Well there's a ton of footage on Ufos now that you can't wrap your brain around.

Speaker 1:          01:23:05       Yeah. Okay. Here's some interest. Something interesting about the Yeti finger. They said the DNA tests have found it to be a human bone. Well, here's what's interesting.

Speaker 5:          01:23:15       Um, they sent me Stewart's wife smuggled a human, but they think

Speaker 1:          01:23:20       that these things are fucking human. It doesn't mean that that's wrong. The people that I thought that they thought that this was like some sort of like a rank attack giant around a tank thing. But no, they think it's like that, that Hobbit, that homofloresiensis you're aware of that those little tiny man they found the island.

Speaker 5:          01:23:38       Yeah. Well that was a human. Yeah. Well that's, that's uh, you know, the native Americans up in the Pacific northwest, just, Eh, you know, Eh, you know, some, some, some of the tribes just attributed to Sasquatch as a, as another tribe. I mean, it wasn't, yeah, she's now how have you gone on down this rabbit hole then? The amount of people who go, dit disappearing in our parks? No. There is no federal database set up for people who go missing in the parks. And it's a, I can't remember the number. It's huge. There's an author who wrote a book about it. It's really fast. And do they think that these are yetis are, he doesn't even go down that road. He just says, why is it, it's a, we should look it up. I don't know what the number is. He, he's saying, Ooh, what is this? Why isn't there a and where all these people gone? I can't, oh, I feel really

Speaker 1:          01:24:31       well bringing up, they could starve to death. I mean, you, you get lost in the woods and you could get lost easily. But the weird part is the Fed's not taking the time to have a database. I actually have a friend whose dad died in the woods. He went hiking and then the fog rolled in and he goes, did they find him eventually? Yeah. Oh yeah. Um, I think they didn't find him for a long time too, but you know, you can't that

Speaker 5:          01:24:55       now out in the woods like, like we were, eh, what happens to your mind when you were out there? That's pretty funny to me. Well, it's, it's very, how late did you stay up?

Speaker 1:          01:25:05       Oh, we were all, we were, we didn't sleep in the woods. We decided to stay in a hotel that was in town. It was a way. Yeah. But just being around there at night when you're in those woods, okay. Even in the day when you go into those woods, well, you're gone. We were in Mount Rainier. You go into those woods and there's, it's another world, first of all, those elk that bound in front of you and they're, oh, you know, five, 600 pound animal just jumped.

Speaker 5:          01:25:29       Yeah. That's weird. When you run into a animal, I saw that up in Willow Creek, uh, and uh, that, that aren't afraid of you. That's the weird part. I didn't know what the fuck you are. Yeah. Yeah. But I've never seen one of you fair. Which was pretty fun because a couple of the guys, it was really funny because we were at Laos camp, which a, if anybody knows that's really close to that. And one of the guys goes, cause we had two women, the actress and producer, and um, uh,

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       I never had a woman here before. This is around a campfire in the middle of the night. I go, fellows, I'm gonna stop you right there. That's usually when the rape and started.

Speaker 4:          01:26:12       Yeah. You shouldn't even say that. Even if it's true. I keep that shit to yourself son. And I used to get women out here, never had women out here. So as far as the things that they've collected, like the, the Ufo, you know, quote unquote evidence to me the most interesting shit is the halls that are really insane. Primate Howells and the dermal ridges that they found footprints.

Speaker 3:          01:26:34       Some of them was great, like, like in the middle of the night and, and uh, it's, it's awesome. I was once, uh, uh, before the keynote speaker got up, one of the guys, he mentions there's two guys like an opener, you know, this is the feature that that butter and a MC. So basically the feature brings up Ufo is while he's doing his big foot pitch and about a third of the room went like, boy, but this group, I'm going to take a piss.

Speaker 4:          01:27:11       Yes. Well there's people in the big foot community that like make fun of would knockers yeah. Would knock and like they're just going to, would not back mom.

Speaker 3:          01:27:22       Well I said, you know these guys who upset if you smoked tobacco in them and there's, you know, there's people with crying babies and making bacon and you know,

Speaker 4:          01:27:30       well the one guy saying to the other guy that you never find big foot because your smoke. I've seen big foot three times. You're never going to see big foot because you smoke. That's fucking, that cuts out a man.

Speaker 3:          01:27:39       So I was like wondering like how's this guy feel about grass? Does he think that big foot's down with grass big was probably attracted to weed. That's well I have noticed that a few fellow Sasquatch hunters a little could possibly be a little bit. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:27:56       well squashing. When you're high, it's probably way more fun than you know, Oh God, sober squatch much to be desired. Really think folks can't wrap their brains around how many millions of acres there are still in like California and Oregon and Portland that are completely like a plane goes down and no one finds it. I think you're totally right. And I think that's one of the things that we tried to capture on the show when we went up into Mount Rainier. I was like, the way I described it, trees, oh, like it's like a box of Q tips. You know how you get a box of cute tips and you know they're just shoved in there. You're not getting through that. You're going to get through that going on with this one step, right. And one step left and one step you're going to like slowly have to see, saw your way through all these trees. Like this is incredibly dense rain forest and there's thousands of square miles, thousands and you can't just get to the middle of it. There's no, there's not trails through all of it. So if something was living up there, he could see you coming a fucking mile away, hide from you. So easy,

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       especially if it had better senses than us. Which if it lives in the woods, it's got to have like animal senses course probably. It was senses like a dog does. Sure. Dogs would be able to hear you and see a human being. Yeah. But dear, dear, see you coming a mile away. They hear you coming a mile away. Well I, uh, so, so tell me, or you're not trying to talk too much about the show you did. Who did you go out with? A, I'm not trying to talk too much better, but women with these guys from Wasser, the Washington state, uh, Sasquatch research team, these guys. Was it a black cord attached? Yeah, they were great guys. They were a hardcore dedicated squatters and they took us to like some serious spots and we saw some weird shit. We saw some trees that were arranged in some really peculiar positions in the middle of the forest.

Speaker 1:          01:29:50       We also saw some trees that were broken in the middle, which is really weird cause there's no, there's no wind inside this forest. You know, you're deep, deep in the forest and you see trees. They're snapped in half, seven feet up. Like something grabbed it and snapped it. I don't know what the fuck it was. I mean, I don't know what happened, but it's weird. You know, you see that. But to them squatch and wanting to see your church. There's an area in Alaska, I don't know if you're familiar with it, how deep you went with your big,

Speaker 5:          01:30:21       I have not gone to a Alaska, Alaska, the trees that you treat

Speaker 1:          01:30:26       uprooted Jamie. See if you could find the photo. There's a, these two trees in Alaska that they believe bigfoot has uprooted. Ain't got [inaudible] to the ground. Not yet. Again, doing a gig up there in two weeks. Which town? I'm doing a Gig in anchorage. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:30:40       Well the anchorage is really, uh, it's beautiful. But um, yeah, maybe that's why I'm going off the grid. That's great. I'm gonna delete it too now. I mean I did two dates in February in Anchorage. Oh, he kind of reassess your career choices the second time you go. Hello. Ain't grits. How cold was it? It was so cold, but it's, you know, it's this weird thing. There's guys wearing shorts and sneakers cause they just go in and out of heated things and it's dry. There's like snow places that never goes away.

Speaker 1:          01:31:11       These are those trees. They're picked up by the roots and driven into the ground and no one knows how the fuck it was done. They know that it wasn't done with heavy equipment because there's no, like, apparently there's no marks in the trees at correspond to the use of a heavy equipment. Now what do you think that allegedly, I don't know. I mean, you, here's the thing, when you hear these stories, you're hearing about them, see if there's any other photos of that. Jeremy, better ones. I've seen some different ones that are more in detail, but the, they don't, you don't know how much you're dealing with just people that are in love with that Shit, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:31:44       Sure. But I, I, uh, you know, there's, there is, um, there's a cynicism that you can have and then there's the question of, uh, of what if, and, and, and you could even be, say, all this stuff

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       is bs, but I do love the, the what if, right, right. Yeah. It's, Jane Goodall thinks they're real. Yeah. Jane Goodall. Yeah, sure. That's legit. That's when my, that's when, that's when the o nine gave me shark guys. When I pulled out Jane Goodall, she really, you know, I mean like, you know, sharks, you know, they wrote, they wrote back before they bite. She's like, wow, well people don't think it's bullshit and you would start pulling out Jane Goodall. That's all you know. That's, that's again the, the, the uh, the o nine, she likes to say this movie, the Willow Creek. That's what the name of this movie is that we're talking about. It's that I can't announce it yet. It got into some bigger festivals that'll happen soon. It matches in the movies. Um, I'm, um, I think that there's, you know, that you can make a good trailer for the movie and I think it could open.

Speaker 3:          01:32:53       I think it's different than the other movies. I would go see that if I was on a date. She got such a great date night movie. It's fucking, man. It's a fun look. And obviously I'm very biased because I love you and I'm a big foot Dork, so it was a double combination. But, uh, I enjoy the shit out of it, man. Thanks ma'am. Thanks. You're welcome. I am, you know, it's funny, I just, you know, I'm starting now to make about a movie a year, different sizes, different budgets, different people. And uh, and then in the meantime I do other, I work for other folks and I do stand up like I'm about to go do patents new, a comedy central special. I'll direct that. Oh, that's great. You're getting a standup special. Yeah. Yeah. Where's he filming that?

Speaker 3:          01:33:35       He's going to be a comic con. I mean that is, yeah, that is, that is like if like a stack the deck. Yeah, exactly. Like if you were in one of those giant southern, uh, cathedrals that holds, you know, the mega churches and then Christ actually just came out of the floor. He just showed up. That's what pat and that comicon is going to be like. I love Patton. His writing is fucking fun. Yeah, he's brilliant. So, so, uh, that kind of stuff, like if I can work with a comic and, and try to, and you know, and try to make it easier when they show up so they're not worried about, you know what I mean? Some knuckleheads, you know, that, that, that, that makes me really happy. That's just a satisfying, believe it or not as going out and doing a show. Oh, that's awesome. Because I, yeah, cause I love comics and I don't, I don't, I don't like it when people make it harder. You know what I mean? Like just before you go on the, on TV, everybody's saying the worst thing you could do. Good. Making me lose. That's the worst thing ever. You know, they're questioning, you're going to do good. You know, my friend Tony, like when he be, yeah. So like he was, I love Toby. So I sent him flowers when he's on Letterman and it just said, don't fuck this up. And then one time he was taping another

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       TV show and it was years ago and it's a, I go, Tony, I'm coming down there tonight to watch the tape. He goes, oh, I really don't know. I'm bringing Robin Williams, so don't fuck this up. He just thinks you're my friend and he doesn't know that you're funny. So really do good. He's like fucking anthem. And then of course, you know you do that to a guy and they go up in there and they're laughing because he's like, subconsciously he's going, well Bob wouldn't back out. It's not going to tell me I'm gonna fucking blow if you, you know what I mean? So you need a safety zone. You need, you need friends that are driving you nuts before you go on.

Speaker 1:          01:35:33       Well it seems like what I like about what you've done with your, you know, I hate the word career, but I guess that's what it is, you know? Clear. Oh, seems so formal. What you have, you have, you express yourself. What I like about it is that you have not boxed yourself into any one corner. Like this big foot thing is just fucking freaky hormones.

Speaker 5:          01:35:53       That's why I love that. It's like so funny. It's like people like, you know, their perception and then you make it and it's really fun to watch for that

Speaker 1:          01:36:00       what you, but what I was going to say is you, but also like I'll run into you and you direct and the Chappelle show, a running a ranch. You, you're directing Kimmel. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you're doing all this weird shit, but you're doing your, you're equally competent at all of it. And it seems like you're equally enthusiastic about all of them, which is, it allows you to like direct someone, stand up and enjoy it as much as doing your own standards, which you also enjoy.

Speaker 5:          01:36:21       Yeah. I, it's, it's, I'm, I'm pretty lucky now. Now, you know, the other side of it is, is like, it's, it's, it's not, um, it's probably the least secure I've ever been financially. But there's something awesome every time you, you, you jump off and you go, Hey, what am I going to do next? You know? And every time it works out in some harebrained way, you know, I mean, I gave the commencement speech at my daughter's school at Hampshire College, you know, and I was, I really, well, first I went up and I just read an Oprah speech word for word. I, you know, whenever I'm nervous, I always go to Oprah and then, and it was all about making it and as I blah, blah, blah, dreams and hopes, and I guess this doesn't apply to any you kids. He got to, you guys gotta quit as often as possible in life until you end up someplace that you don't want to leave, you know, and uh, and you could smell the parents stomach acid, you know, they just spent all this money on an education. It's so true. That's an amazing advice

Speaker 1:          01:37:22       as many times as you can until you find something you don't want.

Speaker 5:          01:37:25       You know? And, and like, there's a weird thing for guys our age. I mean you're, you're younger than me, but where we were doing all different things and, and you know, are we enjoying them or not? And then all of a sudden this age, we come onto our own and it's, um, it, the, the, the, the freaky part is like, after world's greatest dad, I wrote five screenplays. I mean, I just write screen plays all the time and someone goes, well, who are you competing with? And I'm like, the grim fucking man. I thought like sitting and over at, you know, competing

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       with, that's not an interesting question, that if you produce anything, you create something. You're competing against somebody to create it. And what a shitty mentality, but common, you know, it's a common thought.

Speaker 5:          01:38:07       Well, yeah. And as soon as you can remove those guys and make it, you know, yourself instead of other people and you're not judging what you make by their standards and stuff. It's a, it's a, it's a pretty awesome place. Yeah. That's a thing

Speaker 1:          01:38:21       now being a, you know, a grown ass man too. It's like you get to a point where you're comfortable in your own life and you're comfortable with what you do when you know what's good and what you've done. You've had enough feedback by what you've done that you enjoy and what you've done that you did for money. And then you get to this sort of like place where you're like, okay, I know what I'm doing here. Yeah. And on the line

Speaker 5:          01:38:42       pink cloud, you know when, when you know there's gigs I take for the bread and there's things I do, but you know it, it does make it a little easier when you're sitting there, you know, and you're asking what, what is, what is your police academy? I'm interested in that. Like what does it bring up your factor? Fear factor. Okay. And you're, and you're polite, I'm sure when people talk about it. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:39:00       I enjoy doing it. You know, fear factor was nothing. There's nothing artistic about fear factor. But there was a, I had a lot of great moments,

Speaker 5:          01:39:06       but there are a couple of questions that you've heard a million times, right? Oh yeah. What is it? What is the one,

Speaker 1:          01:39:12       did you ever eat any of that stuff? Hey, Joe's fear factor for you? Yeah, but I, I have a very healthy attitude about it and you know, I'm happy that people enjoy the show, you know? And uh, I understand what it would be like if I enjoyed the show and I ran into me. I might say something stupid too. I might say it's for refractive. You Buddy. Cause I wouldn't know what else to say. I'm an idiot. Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:39:35       You, but you don't did test it. We do our best and smile through it. Yes. But this person doesn't realize they're the third person that stopped me today at the airport and asked me at the end, you went to your gate. No. You know what it is. It's always, you know what it is. It's the security people. When you take in your belt with that horse, you're mad. You did that. You did the mood, the beer. Oh, you did that shit. Oh, it's worse because they go, I don't know. They are looking at me and I never heard of them do the voice. It's the word Jimmy Kemble loves the bust my balls harder than anyone about the voices as you know, like if we're doing the show and you know, doing the commercial, I over the do the voice, I guess. That's hilarious. Jimmy went and got a star and that was a, I hadn't seen him in a while, so I went and got, I went with him while he, yeah, I was very tight. So you got a star on the Hollywood was really sweet. It was just a real, it was a real [inaudible] moment where everybody, that guys that I've seen in and out of his life and hey, you know, it's really sweet to watch the, Oh Dang goes, you know, I tried to get you a star and uh, I go, what happened? They

Speaker 5:          01:40:53       said, ma'am, the pasta must request, right? Again, it's another, it's another thought. You were dead. And I said, they were, I go, what did you do? She goes, well, I, I, the guy insisted you dad and I said, I'm your wife. And then I was like, I would have taken a dead star. I don't care. You know, they showed up in like Gore makeup, they gave you a star Star and then you showed up for the, and they're like, fuck is going on

Speaker 4:          01:41:25       in this day and age. I mean everyone Zombie obsessed. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:41:27       Yeah. I just come in Gore makeup with maggots coming out of an Isiah. I get, she killed me. That would be

Speaker 4:          01:41:36       really funny man. Especially if you, I mean, sure you can get somebody in Hollywood to do it up really good. Like walking dead style.

Speaker 5:          01:41:42       Yeah. Real estate. Sure. Yeah, that'd be awesome. So I have a question. What's the, you did this one episode. What? What's the next one?

Speaker 4:          01:41:50       Well, we've done, we're doing six. We were picked up for six. It starts July 16th so there's a,

Speaker 5:          01:41:56       I had a similar idea, but what I wanted to do, and this was after shooting Willow Creek, I thought it'd be funny to like go, let's say I go the Jersey Devil. Right, right. But I make it because I, I'm interested in filmmaking. So I get Kevin Smith to go with me in a tent and we go and sleep out and look for the Jersey down. Yeah, that would be great. And then you just keep going. But it's always like, you know, John Waters is Baltimore. And we'd go and we'd go find that and go into this, this haunted house in Baltimore again. You know, it just came up.

Speaker 4:          01:42:29       Well, the way what I'm doing is some of them I'm doing with Comedians, like I did a one with Duncan Trussell. He went with looking for big foot with me. And uh, Ari Shaffir is going to go to a transhumanist con com conference with me in New York. Transhumanism is no chance here. People that want to download consciousness into computers like Ray Kurzweil and other, like all the people that are into robots. And uh, so, uh, he's going to go and do some of that with me too. So a lot of it we're doing, I'm doing it like with comic friends,

Speaker 5:          01:42:58       but it's cool to go have an open mind and just not be snarky because here's the thing, what people don't realize, all of these different subcultures and stuff, they have a sense of humor. Yeah. You don't have to roll your eyes. You know? I mean like there's a lot of laughs in willow creek from these guys and they're just, they know they're making jokes. They're not, you know.

Speaker 4:          01:43:21       Yeah. They listen to the guys that we were hanging out with up in Seattle and Mount Rainier. They were great guys and one of the guys had a great point. He goes, hey, he's, he had never seen big fun and he had been fascinated by it and he'd been looking. He said, listen, if I don't ever even see big foot, I'm still camping. I'm enjoying the wilderness, having a good time. He goes, I wonder why people get so aggressive about it. They'll get aggressive about music. But I mean, yeah, that's true. You know, they get aggressive about movies. They get aggressive about TV shows. Like,

Speaker 6:          01:43:52       how the fuck are you watched it?

Speaker 5:          01:43:53       I uh, I had a, um, now it's actually so played out, but I had a story when I was directing Kimmel show about Nickelback and the first time I tell the story I go, I go. And I wasn't like, I think making fun of Nickelback is really hacky at this point. But I really said, I go, what's the band that sucks? And the guy immediately Nickelback I go, yes, they were on the show. Now as a comic, I go, I'm going to see if that works tomorrow night. And it does every time. It's like, it's really funny that these, these guys, for some reason or the whipping boy of music understand that, but confused. I will tell you, I will, I will tell stories out of school that, you know, uh, the, the, the manager of Nickelback came into the booth and he goes, don't shoot Chad from the front.

Speaker 5:          01:44:47       And I'm like, I don't even know what chat is. You know, I, I figured out that's the lead singer. He says, don't shoot Chad from the front. I was like, why ain't cause cause of his nose? Just shoot him. Don't shoot him profile. Just shoot them in the front. That's what I'm sorry. He said shoot her in the front. No profile. That's why I said, I was like, okay. So he leaves and all the cameramen are my best friends. And when you're a television director, that's who you really bond with. And they're like, oh dude. Hey Bob, can I drag, you know, you're letting the manager Nicole Vector Act, you know, they are really busting my balls. So if you see the cumulus show as this show goes off the air, the band's playing, right. And so I go, yeah, there's, there's a profile shot. And uh, just as a, I go to the AED, I go, tell me when I have 10 seconds left. She goes, okay. And she has 10 seconds. I go shoot the nose and six cameras go whizzing in from every direction. And I did just, I did a montage, it was, and I go, ready, camera five, ready for already three ready, six ready? Said, I just did the, did the, did it. And we just, we just went off the air with this guys knows it's super quiet and in the headsets and the guys go, hey man, what are we going to do now? And I'm like, uh, I didn't

Speaker 6:          01:46:02       plan for that. I'm getting in my car. I have a good weekend guys. Did anybody yell at you? Well, I know that it didn't make the west coast broadcast that, that, that he censored the nose. Well, I'm sure people flipped out because I did that something that I did something like that to another band and I know that's fucking knows it's not that bad, ugly God. If someone didn't come into the booth and tell me what to do, I wouldn't even have done the tribute to his nose. What do you attribute the, um, the whole hate for Nickelback too. It was, it they're there to smooth I think too polished. I don't, I mean there's two poppy, I don't understand why, why just suddenly everybody gangs on Nickelback when there's so much more crap in the world. I don't know. It's just this weird, well, you know what it is.

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       I'll tell you what it is. There's a safety and bullying, you know, we all decide that we're going to bullying Nickelback then you're not bullying or Justin Bieber. Yeah, yeah. Whoever fill in the blank liking him or disliking Justin Bieber, I don't have that kind of time. You know what I mean? I don't even know why, you know, he's not for me right though. He does. But then again, 50 year old men, you know? Yeah. But here's the thing, you know? Yeah. And I just, you know, I, I, uh, I think of him in terms of like Donnie Yasmine, when I was growing up, you know, I, I, you know, I was threatened and weirded out and then when I got older I was like, Hey dad, he asked me this. Isn't that bad guy? Nice guy. Yeah. Isn't that weird? You end up meeting that. He was super nice.

Speaker 1:          01:47:30       Did it show you the Donny and Marie show

Speaker 5:          01:47:33       [inaudible] that I used to bring out a puppet and do and do so stupid and do weird things. I do like a puppet show with them to understand, well, you know, I'm gutting fish. So it wasn't that much of a stretch for me to pull out a Donny Osmond down my early standup. There was no jokes. I mean I'm a, it's nice that you like to meet Bob because I had material then, but it was just doing one weird thing after another. I was super influenced by Andy Kaufman and Steve Martin and stuff like that. So, so, uh, if I did well it would kind of go well. And then sometimes when I did bad it she'll go off the rails. You know, it just ruined all the other guys.

Speaker 1:          01:48:12       Well, you guys were, it was such a that that comedy environment was such a, like a, a hot environment, but it also, the Boston comedy environment really supported originality. Originality was, it was really huge.

Speaker 5:          01:48:25       Yeah, it was weird. It was nice that that like if you were derivative, you didn't get work, you know, so, so, and you've got shit on. Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:48:33       You got shit on by all your peers. Nobody just let that slide. They kept a high standard, which is difficult for people don't want to maintain a high standard, but for people that have like, you know, you realize that you're going to have to be judged by your peers. Got this weird

Speaker 5:          01:48:47       court of your peers so you don't do this, you don't do that. You don't get other people's actually then you go on stage, then we're going to goose it and have the, some of the toughest worst crowns. Yeah. So it was a, it was a good place. Comedy style. Sure. Animals. Did you play it again? Sam's, I had my own, I had a thing called dollar night at Sam's that, and it'd be means Steven Wright and we'd walk the room, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:49:16       I started out of the paradise stitching, my first gig. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:49:21       I have a question for you. Do you think anybody's going to come along and, and as a comedian and ever be what Steve Martin was? Do you know what I'm saying? Like, or do you think we're too fractured as a society? Like my mother had weighed in on Steve Martin. You know, she thought he was funny. Right. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 1:          01:49:39       And you did as well. So when across the board, really that's what I'm saying. My jag calf again is squeaky clean and I think funded everybody. Brian Regan.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       But these guys appeal to everybody, but they're not the phenomenon. They're not on the cover of rolling stone. Right. Affiliate link. I don't think. I don't think it could happen. I mean there's certain things I don't think can happen anymore because of the digital age. And I say it's good or bad, but I'm just saying I don't know about that because Dan Cook crack through because the digital age, and although his was like more of like a teeny bopper sort of a crack, that guy was doing 18,000 seat arenas and that was very Steve Martin neck. But when I was growing up, Steve Martin, you had to deal with, you know, my parents if they were alive, would not know who Dane Cook is. Yeah. But that's just Dane Cook. I'm saying he broke through in this digital age people, that'll be huge. But I don't think there'll be people that, that, that are so huge that, that everybody in the family knows them and they're a phenomenon. Wonder. I mean, you know, they don't think it could happen again. You might be right. And we are definitely more fragmented than ever before. And in a way it's a good thing because there's a lot more audience for more obscure people that wouldn't have had an outlet before. I think that's great. I think that's great too.

Speaker 5:          01:50:49       Do worry about like, um, the, our exposure to our, our world gets minute. Or maybe I'll just say for myself, am I going to go to BBC and learn today about the, uh, you know, about the events or am I going to click on

Speaker 4:          01:51:09       fun site and go down a rabbit hole? What do you think's going to happen? I did the same thing. There's something,

Speaker 5:          01:51:15       you know, when you had a newspaper now it's like I'm an old guy yelling, get off my lawn. But you had a newspaper. I go through I, Oh, I'm interested in that and I didn't know that was going on in China and I, I, I think the digital age makes it a little bit too much. You, you can find news that agrees with your outlook, which is weird. The news should not be, you know, it should be, it's never impartial, but it should be. It should be somewhat.

Speaker 4:          01:51:40       Yeah, you could, if you have confirmation bias, you could support it really easily on the Internet. Just sticking to a bubble of like whenever, when I'm ego surfing and I see someone called me a lip tarred and you know, I'm like, I'm so out of their tarred. Tired. Yeah. When someone calls you a liberal, that's hilarious. Self hating liberal liberals, one of the weirdest sort of insults ever because if you look at the like, okay, let's look at the official definition of it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       Definition of liberal. Okay. Where's a,

Speaker 4:          01:52:15       yeah, this is Tara. Tara. All right. Look it up and addiction.

Speaker 1:          01:52:21       It says to open, open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional values. That's hilarious. That sounds pretty positive. Unprejudiced unbegged added broad minded, open minded, enlightened, permissive, free, free and easy and easy going.

Speaker 4:          01:52:42       Those are the, now the only thing that seems to be for me would be

Speaker 5:          01:52:46       to folks is uh, disregarding a, what was it? Disregarding traditional value. I see that that's very threatening to people. There's people that treat the constitution as if it's like the 10, the 10 commandments like that, that, that there's no, you know, we're checks and balances, you know, we can change and adjust things, but there's still people that are so ingrained that's really scary. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:53:07       I think there's also the real problem with liberalism is a lot of people know that folks naturally are inclined to be lazy fucks. And if you give people an easy way out, they'll take it. So as soon as you start advocating giving people aid or helping people at out or people that I get 'em up, get that fucker up. It's like there's a part of people that resent. Yeah, there's a resentment against like the idea is that liberals

Speaker 5:          01:53:35       world, World War II, it's like, hey, you're down on your luck. You know, write a Gi loan, here's this, here's that

Speaker 1:          01:53:41       much, much, much harder world that they were dealing with. And it was only a couple of decades after the fucking depression where people are much more used to living together, scraping to get by. Your parents almost starved to death 20 years ago and they all have stories about it. Yeah. My grandfather had a horrible stories about the depression. Yeah. My Shit down man. Lived through the depression and that'll make 'em well, my old man is a whole nother can of worms, but that was, was mine there. Yeah. The um, you know, what would we be sitting here talking? No. Yeah, you'd never, you'd never be a comic. I think that's one of the number one pieces of a comic that didn't have a fucked up life. I don't think I've ever met one.

Speaker 5:          01:54:25       Basically. I think my act, it was me going on stage going, mom, do you, do you hear me?

Speaker 1:          01:54:34       I think that's, that's in a nutshell. Yeah, that's 100%. But it's funny how that is like my favorite art form comes out of that. In balance. It seems like there's the only way to achieve it is like to achieve it correctly, like something, there has to be some sort of a deficit to create this, you know, this, this, it's a reaction to a lack of something. It's not just a natural progression from, I was kind of a funny guy in high school and I figured, let me try other standup thing, you know?

Speaker 5:          01:55:02       Well, here's the thing, it's, it's what we're missing is that, that those times that we bombed, we probably should have never got back on stage. Right. But we, we, we eat it and then go back up again because the, it's, it's, it's horrible. It's so crazy weird thing. You know, like often the funniest guy in the room is not the comedian. You know what I mean? The comedians got the, the, the illness or the Nads to go up there or both. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, something that happened in lately on stage, and this is, this is not me lying that all of a sudden for the first time in 30 years, I'm sometimes having fun up there. I was always the whole time. Oh yeah. Something new. Like all of a sudden a, um, I'm a, I don't know, man. I'm on this new thing, like sometimes with the right crowd, I actually enjoy it. And uh, and uh, yeah. You know, it's a new new thing.

Speaker 4:          01:55:57       Isn't that funny? That something that people enjoy so much to come see you and it looks like you're having so much fun up there, but for a lot of folks it's just terror and fear and worry about bombing and fucking try to again when it's over, oh fuck. Two more shows tomorrow. Yeah. Even if you're killing every show,

Speaker 5:          01:56:18       it's a, it's a new thing, you know, a, suddenly it dawned on me what was a, a new thing that dawned on me is like, uh, uh, it was okay, these people have an expectation and I'm not doing that, but how can I warm up to them? How can I include them? So it's not just me saying this is what I see the world as. This is what I see is funny. If you don't like a cram it, not saying compromise what I believe in, but suddenly I was doing like a little bit of crowd work that wasn't like, you know, uh, how do you know when you're finished? You know? But you know, to actually just sit around and poke around and talk to folks and it's, it's been different. It's, it made my mom make, doing standup a lot more fun.

Speaker 4:          01:57:02       That's awesome man. I love when people like refined or the joy of performing or find it caused all these tiny still and I'm like, oh, what is he doing? How's he doing that? You know? Is he funny? He doesn't have an opening act. Yeah. Yeah. Any speed is like an hour and a half. I had all, everybody sits down, right?

Speaker 5:          01:57:21       It was actually Louis that he said to me, he was like a c k. He's like, he's like, go see Cosmi. It goes, wow, he's going to do a ton of material. You're going to think 20 minutes went by. He's still funny. And, and Lo and behold, yeah, go on. And I was like, this is weird. I wanted to be bitter and uh, he, he ruined it.

Speaker 4:          01:57:39       And maybe it's because he just enjoys the art form. As long as like stand up to me seems like when I feel like when I'm like really tuned into it, I'm as much of a, I'm like a passenger and I feel like it's a group hypnosis thing. Like you lock people and you know how to do the bits ride. He know where it's going, you know the setup and you hold the pause and it becomes like this big and if you tune into that frequency and nourish shit, as long as you continue to nourish it, it seems like something that would always be there. It seems like when people lose it is when they take a couple of years off and then they'd go back again or something happens. And really

Speaker 5:          01:58:16       I think it just maybe the opposite. It's like when people just, this works, I'm going to do it and just get out of here tonight when my life get the check. You know what I mean? So, cause I know I have done that, you know, but this is different, a new phase where I lived there and I go, all right, um, it's not a mistake. You're here. You know what I mean? I slow it down, slow it down, and instead of blurting out those new ideas, you know, that's usually what I do. Like the first couple of minutes or whatever, the new ideas, there's this and then I do the act. I go, I go, Geez, slow it down. It was, it's a, it has been new, you know, maybe people are like, and I'll see, you know, I keep doing it and see what we see, folks like it. But

Speaker 1:          01:58:57       are you more comfortable as a person now?

Speaker 5:          01:59:00       Yeah. Yeah. So is that it? Yeah. I'm not like, you know, rainbows and cramping and Unicorns all day. I mean, I, I get, I get dark, but I will say, um, the majority of the time I'm happy and I'm happy when I'm making stuff. So now I know that, well, okay, no one greenlit this movie or no one did this and that. I pick up my, you know, I start writing know it doesn't matter if it gets made or not. That process is very freeing.

Speaker 1:          01:59:27       Yeah. There's something about creating things where especially if people enjoy those things, if he could put those things out and they can, like people can like actually get like a, like when you like, so say someone goes to see Willow Creek. If you go and see this movie, which you're going to get is like a feeling you're going to sit down and this thing's going to happen in front of you and you go, ha ha ha, you're going to have all this feeling attached to and you as uh, you know the pretentious word artist, but you as an artist, like as someone who's created this gets to sit there and realize that your effort, your thought, your focus, all this, you piece it together, your edited up and boom and then you deliver it and then you get to watch all this positive reaction and you just want to go do more. We just want to continue that cycle of putting out there.

Speaker 5:          02:00:13       Me. I think it's kind of like, I keep making these movies and it's really exciting, especially like the last four, when, when after the movie people are are Chatty, they're like, rob, I've haven't been that. Which happens. It's really sweet. And, and, and, and, um, and I guess basically what I'm doing is I'm shooting out of flare saying, [inaudible] do you, do you guys see this? Do you guys feel this? Is this right? Or is this going, what's going on? Or wouldn't this be cool? You know, that's, that's what I'm doing when I make a movie.

Speaker 1:          02:00:43       Well, that's the way to do it, man. I mean, you're, you're, it's, it's a true form of expression. Like instead of you saying, Oh, this will sell, you know, hey, if I box this with that and that in a funny black guy, boom, I'm fucking man, I do the voice. Yeah. Instead you're like, you know what, man, I'm fucking into big foot. Let's make this weird fucking crazy movie about big.

Speaker 5:          02:01:05       Well, that's what I got to say about my wife. That's a really funny, she says, she says, go, you know, go to your big foot. Like she can't, you want me to get it? She let me drive around for a week.

Speaker 1:          02:01:18       So is that what you did to, to write it? You just drove around?

Speaker 5:          02:01:21       Truly. It wasn't even like writing. It was really just just, uh, I'm going to go, I'm going to talk to people. I'm just going to do this with no agenda, you know? Wow. I knew that some day I'd probably make a movie, but it was really more just like, do you know how freeing that is? Like, like five, six days, Matt have,

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       you know, the, you know, I still had to do a couple of folders, which is funny. You know, they're going to, where are you looking for?

Speaker 1:          02:01:47       That's hilarious. You're doing phones for gigs. Like, yeah, we'll help me in Peoria at the Jukebox, but right now I, that's it. You know? So, so you go out there, you take 11 days, you go wandering around for bigfoot. Where did you decide to start? Did you have a specific

Speaker 3:          02:02:05       no, no. I drove up first to Santa Cruz and the Sierras twos and I drove around there. Santa Cruz is amazing and never been. It's really, it's really, really awesome. You know, I just went where like kind of kind of poked around and knew certain sites where people had seen, you know, or heard or you know, events, you know. So and, and, and, and that's again, I ended up in Willow Creek. I, I didn't go up to happy camp, which, uh, I probably will still, I mean, that's another pretty a, a Sasquatch. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's above a Orleans. It's above bluff creek and everything. It's, uh, it's still another place that there's a lot of squash. It

Speaker 1:          02:02:45       isn't there a bunch of different names for those areas too that are like monkey names and Apa. Yeah. Canyon, yeah. In Oregon. Yeah. Very strange. How many, why? Yeah. And then, um, in, in Mount Rainier, up in that area, there's a bunch of names that are the, one of the North American names for bigfoot. There's a bunch of like canyons that are named after that. Like, so this guy starts talking about all these different areas and it's got this weird North American, you know, name in it and a, and he said, well that's when we just, that's how we started our big foot squashing. We just started going to all these places as the North American Indians had now her affidavit that it's fucking crazy. Like they names

Speaker 3:          02:03:27       bots again. Yeah. That's makes you fucking think. Yeah. And it's also, but when all said and done, Eh, Eh, you know, it's, whenever you're a sub culture you're going to get ridiculed and picked upon. But like you said, it's just camping.

Speaker 1:          02:03:43       It's camp and it's fun. There's something silly about it. I mean I went with Dunkin trust and we ate pot candies.

Speaker 3:          02:03:48       Yeah. Last. Well that's what I was wondering about the, cause they know some of these guys, they're high of course, but they're very worried about what bigfoot foot, bigfoot likes different smells. And I'm like, are they eating it? They got to eat it.

Speaker 1:          02:04:04       Well, if they're smart, they'd eat it. But even if they, if he eats strong, we'd like you open up. Like, I remember one time, uh, uh, I won't even say his name, but we were on a plane and uh, he had brought a Tupperware thing and it's fucking carry on with weed cookies and it was an international flight. Okay. And this motherfucker opens the lid and he goes, do you want one here? You can say it wasn't him guy. Now I'll tell you that. He opens the lid and the smell was so strong. I'm like, oh my God, we're going to jail. I'm like, are you crazy? Do know what that smells like? He's like, can't even smell it. And I was like, you can't smell it because you've been smelling it for so long.

Speaker 3:          02:04:42       You are in your comment.

Speaker 1:          02:04:44       It was so scary. It was, it was, it was so powerful. Strong. I would think if you had those brownies out there in the woods, big foot's going to fucking smell.

Speaker 3:          02:04:51       No. Have I ever told the Tony Vee story about when he was the American tourist or gorilla? No. Okay. This is great. I don't think so. Tony, you won a contract to be the gorilla. And so he had show up. Now he told he's a big guy, right? He's like two 50, you know, it was maybe a little heavier sometimes, but he's a big guy and I think he's about three, three bills when he was the gorilla. So Rick Baker builds him a gorilla suit. That's one he grant. It's made it like real hair and it's got this whole gorilla, uh, it muscle structure. Now Tony goes to like hockey games and stuff and people get mad, you know, like he goes out on the ice. Fuck you really, you know, this is bad. We're fucking horrible. Our animals animals. So, so Tony, the gorilla seats got a better deal than Tony.

Speaker 3:          02:05:44       It's got a guy that travels with these anvil cases in packs it up and, and, and, and so Tony's doing standup in the meantime with me and hopscotching while he's doing the gorilla dates. Now the gorilla suit is not with us, but he's got this, this oneZ , this big unit tired that he wears under the gorilla suit. And clearly he was having some chafing problems. So he goes and um, so we're getting search through customs going out of Canada and there's all this uh, like white powder and rocks that form from his sweat, from the Crotch, sweat and sweat. The custom guy licks his finger, he picks up one of the rocks and he tastes it. If I'm his balls, you know, it was a ball. It was a rock of baby powder from his ball and this ball sweat and I think I'm kind of, I think I'm witty.

Speaker 3:          02:06:41       I like, it was like go it is that tiers tier can [inaudible] the rock this big hit his tongue. He was just immediately, he was like, I don't know what he's thinking. Like he could tell like he think Paul's and old man Dick and he's just like, what the fuck is going on? It was the best phase just like hyperventilating. We, there we are actually cause I love Tony. Like Tony, I love Tony and I met were just holding each other. We're just two guys just wrapped around each other. Crying is the best thing we ever saw. Serious, furious, furious because we kind of stopped him by the way. He licks the and then he's got all the way down and we both look hook like, all right, it's so funny. That was the best thing. I thought it was coke. He thought he was catching someone who daddy got the bag, got a big case. He's got the big collar is going to get kicked upstairs. That is so fun. I don't eat. Told me one of the morning

Speaker 1:          02:07:52       important things that I ever learned about driving because he was driving back and forth from New York to Boston. It was a long thing and he was doing it a lot. I forget what he was working on, but he was driving back and forth a lot and I go, how do you do that without going crazy? He goes, I just goes. Then he goes, when I'm in the car, I just say, now this is what I'm doing. He goes, there's don't say, man, I wish I wasn't doing this and I could be doing something else. He goes, I just say, this is what I'm doing. And that's, I never thought about it that way. I want, I was like, yeah, you can do things. You don't want to do like that and just, just have it in your head. This is what I'm doing.

Speaker 3:          02:08:26       My wife had a friend who, uh, he was, uh, he sold ice cream and an ice cream truck and it played a Turkey in the straw over and over. Is that data that, that, that, that, that, that the, the, the day, day after day, all day long Turkey in the straw. And he said, you know what? I did? I said, I'm going to make that my favorite song. I became, became his favorite jam. Wow. That's madness. Yeah. Ice Cream truck. That would be the best job. That'd be horrible.

Speaker 1:          02:08:58       Ah, you could deal with a lot of shitty kids there. Would definitely make you want to not have kids.

Speaker 3:          02:09:02       Yeah. And I'd also be like, you're giving kids ice cream down the side and he mostly aren't people just selling weed out of ice cream trucks. I don't know if you're lucky, if you have any good in the van Halen Song. You know, it's funny, as you grow up, like I grew up, you know, I was the first generation of like getting, you know, the Ramones, you know, they, they, I, I, I got to see them live, actually would help build the pas. That's how I'd sneak into bars when I was under age, Ramones, punk rock and all this stuff. And I rebelled against all of this stuff as it kept coming up, like, you know, then later on, the kids, we were in the van Halen. I'm like, that's not punk rock, you know, it was an asshole. But I was down in Baja with a bunch of buddies and they were all surfing.

Speaker 3:          02:09:48       And I'm like the, uh, and, uh, I mean, we're in the middle of nowhere, like about about five, six hours. Yeah. I, you know, just, just, I don't know if you've ever gone out and Mexico, I think it's a little too sketchy now, but there's nothing around there. Any surfers with no shipwreck. It's a famous surf site. And, uh, you know, and we're driving along the side of a cliff and I'm driving this jeep and we're playing Panama from Van Howell fucking loud. And everybody's fucked up except me. I'm the designated. I'm, you know, Joe Sober fucking but I, it was finally, I was like, hey man, I get van Halen. You finally got it. I got it was Panama, that song, great fucking song. I it

Speaker 5:          02:10:34       just loud and there's stars and these guys are screaming and as I keep speeding going over gigantic pot holes, they're all thinking they're doomed. And I was like, it's again. It's like I'm good in chaos. I go now I get van. Now. Isn't that a funny thing that you do though? People do. We all do it. Especially when you're young. Where if someone doesn't like what you like, you fucking angry. So angry. What do you like it? Shit you don't like, you hate them for liking it. Here's an exclusive cause I, I do tell a lot of yarns and they're all true, but I have a lot of stories. Here's the story. I don't, I've never told anyone. When I was opening for Nirvana, we were at, uh, here in la, so I don't know which, which, which form. I think it was a form. I don't know. But I'm an Eddie van Halen shows up and he's really fucking hammered and he wants to jam. And Kurt is totally flipped out. Like Eddie van Halen wants to, he's like hide me, you know, so, so Eddie wants to go up and tread. Yeah. And he's fucking hammered. I go, dude, give him one of your guitars cause, cause Kurt played lefthanded and I go, it'll be, it'll be great. You know, he won't be able to play it. And he's like, he would figure it out. Like this would be so funny.

Speaker 1:          02:11:45       It was really weird and it probably would, we had David Lee Roth coming here. He couldn't be fucking cooler. I met him one night at the comedy store. He was the greatest guy just hanging out. No pretense

Speaker 5:          02:11:58       in the 80s they were going to cause purple rain made money and they were going to give him money and it was just an insane scripty. Oh, it was just a movie.

Speaker 1:          02:12:07       Yeah. I went in and read for why did they never do that? He's so camera's Madec. Yeah. What did they never give him a movie? That's what he's putting on the busy fucking everything. But there could be a movie there, you know? That's the thing. It's like, look at him. You know? Maybe they didn't know what he's doing now. He lives in Japan. Okay. He lives in an apartment with his dog and he practiced his sword fighting all day.

Speaker 1:          02:12:27       I'm not kidding. No. I believe man by himself. He's a fascinating guy. We had him in here. First of all, the fucking guy wears overalls everywhere. He goes. Okay. He's comfortable with his nipples. I don't let me just likes wearing overalls. They bug your nipples. I haven't worn in a long time. I'd have to cut back or over overalls. You know what they have the little things like the farmers where they clip up here and he, yeah, we haven't see, look, he's wearing overalls. You see that? Oh, he's got a shirt on it. Yeah. I thought he wasn't wearing a shirt. No. Look overall,

Speaker 5:          02:12:57       it's hilarious. And, and, and so he, he does his sword and, and this practice, his sword fight and does, and not to be so crass, but does he, is he set, I mean,

Speaker 1:          02:13:07       financially, I'm sure he's got the side. Well, you never know how much fucking money David Lee Roth must have. I by David Lee Roth is, first of all, he's very smart and I think he's also a savvy guy. I do not see him overindulging to the point of something like that. He likes living small. He shows up here by himself and he's one of the biggest rock stars of all time. Drives himself here, shows up by himself. Hey guys, no, no pretense in and sit down.

Speaker 6:          02:13:32       How's everybody? But a lot of, a lot of the, the folks that have longevity do that. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, like I haven't seen him in a long time, but there was a period where I spent some time around, I sound like I'm just name dropping all my stories, but it would take a bow and he would do that. He was like, well, you know, uh, uh, I know, I know. No, no, I'm just kidding. It is a, yeah, it's true. If you know data, here's the thing. You've always, you eat if you're in show business that these are the folks that you, you, you become friends with. Not all of them, but some stories. I mean, you just told me a David Lee Roth story, but you also have a show maybe that, well, he came in to promote his show. He has a podcast.

Speaker 6:          02:14:21       He's going to Japan from Japan. It's fucking great. It's great. He's fun. He gets up and does this, does this podcast, video podcast I think. And then he didn't find out what the addresses, I don't know what the addresses and then he, and then he sword fights. I think it would cause it to the Dave TV or something like that. I remember he also, I heard this, I don't know this is true, but I heard that when you would know this may be because martial arts, he, he would, uh, sweep the stage after the show. Really? I heard that. I don't know if that's true. I didn't ask him, but I could see him doing something like that. Just, just has a discipline. Yeah. I could see him doing. So he's a weird guy though. Show I also, we were at,

Speaker 5:          02:14:57       uh, again with the Nirvana, but this is another funny strive that wisdom. Uh, one of the crew guys had worked with, uh, the new, she had worked with Dennis and Kurt enjoyed hearing the story because you know the nudes, you would hit the stage with an air ramp. Like he hit the, this air ramp, you know, like a stunt man and he would shoot him over the amp.

Speaker 6:          02:15:20       Yeah. And so he can fly in and it with the guitar and just go shooting over and land, which stand on what they hit the stage. And how far would he fall from the top of a stack of Marshall's? Holy shot him off like

Speaker 5:          02:15:33       Canon. So, um, but apparently curtain joke, cause I witnesses hearing the story about when he, he clipped the top of the speakers, would his boot heels and just ate shit and landed on his feet.

Speaker 6:          02:15:46       Oh well his knees are all fucked up. He hobbles really bad now and he just had some serious knee operation be that air ramp, Jesus' side of magic, man. We don't have to go at that way. Flying over the fucking probably cowboy boots on or something stupid. Right. You know, every audience, you know isn't red hot, you know? I mean there's gotta be times where you'll feel like they're in a beer line. I'm trying to get him to do the podcast. He's always going to be at the Canyon Club in July. Why wouldn't need, or I don't know. I shot an animal for them just to be friends that went deer hunting just so I could call my friend and

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       no, that's not why I did, but I really would like to get them in a, he's a fascinating character. Of course he's and his is a hunting show. I watched his hunting show. It's called spirit of the wild. And He, and is it the hunting he, does he go around the world or is it as backyard? The sexy part, not see the ladder. When the Kimmel show is

Speaker 5:          02:16:50       Detroit, I pitched an idea that nobody bit, and the idea was we were going to get the new age right. We're going to get ted on and then we're going to pick like Guillermo and uncle frank and maybe someone else in gold ball hunting. No, no, I was going to s w I was going to give him a paint gun and then make them, you know, the, the, the hardest pray, you know, I mean and send them out in the streets and have ted Nugent, uncle frank. That's funny. You know, and, and it was great cause it was a snow storm. It would've been so fun. You know, I would have been really fun. These guys running away from nudes. Why it's painful falls. I mean that would be, and it was in Detroit and the snow hilarious. I was just in the eyes in Detroit this weekend doing stamp. And then I went to Dallas and showed willow creek down there to a small festival. Couple be oak cliff.

Speaker 4:          02:17:35       First of all, it's food is fun. Nugen has a son hunting show and he sets food out. And then he climbs in a tree with a bow and arrow and just fucks these deer up every day is fucking up a new dear that's going to eat his food now. But see he does he have to abide by? Uh, it depends on the animation can law. It's an he's not Michigan anymore. He's in Texas, fanboy of a Ted Nugent family in Texas. Can he just, you know, shoot. You know what I'm saying? Like if he owns an animal, can he kill it without having to Dubai in Texas is one of the best places for that, for what they call high fence operations. But it depends on the animal and there's a lot of animals that they keep. And those, uh, those high fence places that are not, uh, they're not native to like an African guy. Animals like a cemetery. So they don't have or a season? No, no. Some other, they shoot him whenever they want to so he could shoot them every day if you chose. So they come from another country? Yup. They got, this is pretty nice. I'm getting three squares. Holy Shit. Is that Ted Nugent flying stick right to my heart.

Speaker 5:          02:18:46       My older brother, he, he, he uh, he's, he's no longer with us but he, he uh,

Speaker 4:          02:18:51       he was a poacher. I mean he just shot things all year long. Well that's really common in a lot of places. Yeah. Pacific northwest, it was, they were telling us how to poach. Yeah. We were up there hunting for big foot. There's a, there's a, there was a woman that was a woman who worked at the store. She was like, whoa. She goes, when we, we, we see al could just shoot them with a bow and Arrow and nobody could hear it. They can. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:19:11       Well my brother had everything figured out. He had a, I brought Tony v out to his house once and I've given him some money to buy, to insulate his home and I wanted to buy some new windows and I wanted to make sure you use the money cause I went to visit my brother basically. And Tony, we get out of the car and it's just corn, like psycho corn. It just growing up everywhere and, and tell me what's going on with the court because it's, you know, I mean, there's no rows and my brother's like, oh, that's for the deer, you know, you know by sort of the deer and Tony. He's like, Oh yeah, you, you help them through the winter.

Speaker 3:          02:19:48       I want to blast them. I go up to the top, the window in the bathroom and it's fucking sniper's perch. Yeah. I go, when I'm in the bathroom window, he goes, oh recoil my brother shooting out the window on the toilet. He shooting deer from the toilet. By the way, there's some guys who are going, wow, that guy had it all, all these missing as a qtip lamb. He'd be like, you know, in the end they want to go hunt and meet me in the kitchen. Oh, we're leaving Tony Bigos and what does that over there? Was it like a woodchuck came my brother. He goes, yeah. And then we're not even around the corner and where Blam I just figured that. Would Chuck, when Chuck, what would you shoot a woodchuck animals? He just, he, he was, his friends were telling me stories were amazing stories.

Speaker 3:          02:20:52       I hadn't heard. Oh yeah, your brother. You know, cause there's a swan pond. I was like, don't tell me she'll swatch. He goes, no, no, no. But there was some bigger, I don't know what was in their trout or something. So, so they had taken acid and they were climbed over the swap plan and we're fishing and shooting. He would go, dynamite fishing life is like, you know, I had back surgery, let's it a month and a half ago. It was my birthday at the end of May and I get a ladder out and the whole nine, it's like, what are you doing? I go, well, I think it'd be fun to jump into the pool from the ladder because cause, and she's like, that is a horrible, right. I just see you slipping. Oh, coming down the ladder. Well,

Speaker 5:          02:21:35       I'll give you an idea. I was sitting at home and, um, and because of the back surgery and what did you get done to your back? I had some, a disc and bone spurs and I feel great. And they do. They took a little bit of my disc away and took out the bone spurs. But I had other problems before. I had nerves that were smashed into two vertebraes yeah. That we're making. So my leg just, I couldn't walk and I have back issues. That's all really have a disc. A bulging disc. Oh, well I have a dude, when you want to calculate the cut a piece of the disc away and I got to tell you, it hurt. Uh, the surgery heals up and now my leg and I don't have back pain. You know, I lost 20 pounds. I as soon as cause I could, I have my life back. But what's amazing, but, so I said that I've been sober since I was 19, but here's, I mean, yeah, 19 so, but the thing was like with back surgery, I,

Speaker 3:          02:22:26       I had a break. I, you know, I, I, they put me on the lot. It was a VA based. Yeah. So have you had the line of no, it's in cowboy movies. Yeah. It's morphine. So, so it's the shit that killed Lenny Bruce. Really? Yeah. So, so it's awesome. By the way. It's the best day ever. I was trying to explain it and I was like, I said, it's not cause like people describe heroin as, as coming as, as like, you know, like that and it's like, no, it's dilaudid is like, um, right after that and before regret, you know what I mean? Shame and regret, right? The bribe second window and a, and it lasts all day. What would you put Nyquil? Like original Nyquil? The real shit compared to it a lot at like a, like a two. Whoa. Yeah. I'm telling you man. It was like, it was, you know, and I'm glad I went through this back surgery and, and when it was over, got off the dope, that's what we're going to.

Speaker 3:          02:23:27       And I gave him nervous about that. I was terrified, terrified. And I gave it, I gave it to the, oh no. Why did you need it? Because of the pain. I mean, the pain was so bad. Like they're, you know, they go into your surgery, pain pre and post. But, but the problem was, is that I have, uh, I have no sense of reality. Like, I don't know the difference between an ingrown toenail and a ruptured disk. I really don't like, it's just pain, you know what I mean? So I was in so much pain and, um, it was, it was so, but here's at one point already I have a problem with good ideas and bad ideas. So, so my friends are over the house and, uh, I said to my wife, I go, wouldn't it be funny if I shot a hole in the roof with a 22?

Speaker 3:          02:24:13       She was, it wouldn't be funny at all. I go, yeah. It scared the cats while you were on dilaudid in, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I at least a hundred Thompson Jr over here. At least I read it by while she's there for you. It's like no that way cause your filter. Yeah. It's amazing. You need someone to tell you that. Uh, well, uh, that was the lot, but, but I will say it's always, and I've passed this down to my daughter, it's always the funny story that outweighs everything else. Oh, like later on it's the fall. That's also what's gotten you mean as a comic? That's what's gets you like your life, your career. We, your livelihood is having these stories. It's a, it's a valuable asset. Well, I love that my daughter has it. Oh, that's, well that's cool. Like she loves her daddy. She went to a wedding, she says, I didn't know anybody. I go, well, what did you do? She said, during the first song I ran out in the hump, the bride. Fuck is that bro? And she really did that. Yeah, of course. She always knows that the, it's the stories.

Speaker 6:          02:25:24       You know, she's got the photos. Look Daddy, you know when you took this dilauded Shit, you were 19 you quit doing everything and then exit 19 to 50 and then there's nothing in between.

Speaker 5:          02:25:34       Well, I had a back surgery before, so that, that was funny because at one point, like I said, I, I put it in the hands of someone else. I give it to, to, to, to my wife.

Speaker 6:          02:25:44       Give yourself a greenlight to do shit like that because you're in pain. Like I had, again, I had to talk to other folks and say, look man, and that had to explain this is what this is for. But I've, uh, I've had surgery before knee surgery and I just dealt with the pain because I don't like, like I don't like, I don't like all that stuff. All that stuff actually has a really weird reaction to me and I become a big asshole. Oh, that's interesting. I become really nasty. Make you cranky and just a really an asshole. And I mean, I'm not like punching my wife, but I mean I would just, you know, short and

Speaker 5:          02:26:17       tell her what to do. And so, so this was what worked. And, um, and uh, you know, I was on this and, uh, the first time and, and, and she, did you ever try to do it without it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely pain and they're going, this is crazy. You know? And they actually just slammed morphine into my back, cause they're going, this is crazy that you're walking around, you know? And then I thought, well, okay, I can handle it. I'm sorry they did. You know what? I did. I just vomited immediately. That's fine. But, but I was, I was sitting there one day and uh, this is the first time and, and, and I'm watching 'em lifetime and I'm just sobbing and my wife comes in. She goes, you don't get any more pain medicine starting now. I married a man. Oh, that's funny. I did not marry him. Man. Cries during mommy. May I sleep with danger? Started Tori spelling or whatever. I was watching. I'm lifetime lifetime movies made you cry.

Speaker 6:          02:27:23       Yeah. She's like, it remind me. She's like, that's, that's it. Remind me not to take that stuff ever. I didn't want to cry and I want to watch lifetime. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          02:27:32       I was doing Q and A's for the movie on dilaudid.

Speaker 6:          02:27:36       Wow. We went to the Boston film. Tells the people that you on it. Yeah. I just said I'm really high. What else was I going to do now? Was it painful just to like sit down? Just like to sit up straight? It got to the point where yes,

Speaker 5:          02:27:49       sitting was a pain and walking was a pain and yeah. And it affected my life to the point where, I don't know if you're this way, what you go, uh, you, you, you measure things. If I go to the store that's going to hurt a lot. Can I go? You know what I mean? It's affecting what you do to the point where I, you know, I didn't have, I was 50 or in my late forties and thinking like a, a senior citizen, so whoa. And now I'm back.

Speaker 6:          02:28:15       That's amazing. Yeah. Back surgeries, scary shit. Back surgeries. Spooky one for people I've ever, well

Speaker 4:          02:28:22       it sounds, I have a great doctor, but it sounds like, are you worried about the controls surrendering it? Is that it? I mean I, I went to a bunch of doctors. Oh really? Yeah. I've had no surgery. Back Surgery, knee surgery twice, three times, three 11 uni. I tore my ACL and both knees. I had a reconstructed and I told him I'm doing this. Just the first one was a kickboxing. The second one was Jujitsu. And what happens when it happens? You're like, well, the first one that you broke, I knew something was really bad. I knew something was really wrong. It was like a pop and just terrible, terrible pain. The first one, uh, her a lot more. The second one didn't even hurt. It was really weird because it was, um, I was in what's called a half guard, so someone's legs are wrapped around your legs and he extended his legs and my leg went sideways and just went stop like a carrot.

Speaker 4:          02:29:17       It was really weird. It was like this pop noise. And then, uh, I didn't even know it was the ACA was gone until I was walking. I think it was in my office. I was moving something like, just gave out on me really weird. And I had already had my left done, so I knew that my right was probably fucked. So first one, was that during a match? No, it was training. Both of them were during training. Okay. And what does, how does the other guy feels? He's like, know it wasn't fault. It was totally easy. Does it feel weird? Oh yeah. He felt bad. He felt terrible. The Guy, will's the guy who it happened to the second time, it was a friend of mine. He's a really nice guy and he was terrible when you train. I haven't had it guys. I had a guy's lady explode on me a couple of times.

Speaker 4:          02:29:57       Yeah, two different times that I can remember one time the guy blamed me but that was ridiculous. It was just weird. It's just in the middle of scrambling like sometimes you need just gives out. And then the other one time was a guy didn't tap in time in his knee, just exploded. It went pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. But it was like, it was a weird situation. It was like he didn't really have to tap like sometimes like you can get out of things and you're real close and then I'll something in the middle of like trying to get out of it. Like he was pretty close to getting out of it. His knee just gave out. Like it was a weird sort of a thing and it made this horrible, loud sound. And that sounds to me you're, you're thinking that I'm crazy cause I'm an, I am a jump off the ledge.

Speaker 4:          02:30:38       I was going to get someone to steady it. Well it's, it can be dangerous. Like I said, I've had my nose opened up. It's a little insane but it's also very intoxicating. It's fun. It's like a, it's a very exciting game now about now you don't do it. Sure do. Wow. Yeah. Well the only thing that's stopping right now, so I have this little disk issue but the disc is getting a lot better. It's pretty close. Yeah. You gotta get it taken care of? No, it's not. It's not like a, it was only a few millimeters, the bulge. So it was something that with spinal decompression and a bunch of different cases saw mine, the law and the MRI and it was like a comedic, it looked like a, a bicycle tire with a bloop. Oh Wow. It was that big. And I remember how many millimeters or poked out like they put on

Speaker 6:          02:31:20       the Mri and the two doctors go, oh you like, you're like slow. Yeah. It was like, okay, mine is actually asymptomatic right now. It's a stiff and it just does getting things out of the things. This is the problem. The problem, the problem is by the time you figure out how to do it, what makes you happy? The wheels start falling off. They were just telling me you might need to get glasses. I mean it's, yeah, no, I definitely should get reading glass. What have actually reading classes. Like when I look at things like anything that close is, is kind of blurry. Like right there that's blurry. But like, my computer's fine. I can read everything on the computer. I need it. It's things are close. Well my phone sometimes, sometimes our wake up, I can't read a number and I'm like, fuck you, look if I have to actually dial it on my home phone, I'm just looking at like, what the fuck is that?

Speaker 6:          02:32:07       It's weird. Then I have to go. Like I said, it's the cruel, cruel joke at time. Yeah. Time as mother fucker. It. Uh, you know, I, I hate to be so cliche, but as you get older it's, you know, like, you know, that's, that's like I said, that's who I compete with now. Yeah. Well that's one of the reasons why, um, I think like going, I'm not like going, wait a second, did the grim reaper get a comedy central special mother fucker? What do I got to do? A competing? Yeah. You do rewind up thinking you got to get out more ship before you go. I want to be behind. Conflict is what builds everything is what creates everything. It's why anything's interesting. Conflict or pure enjoyment of whatever. You're doing that too. That's true. Conflict kind of, there's a bunch of things that can move along.

Speaker 6:          02:32:54       Right. Well the cool thing is, is if you, if you stop making the conflict being other people and you use your own demons as the conflict and then you don't have to create, you know, you know, yeah. I can sit there and write a screenplay and, and not go down and not go to a terrible place. Yeah. Go, yeah, go back and forth with myself. When you create something like a, like this movie or anything that you write it, do you sometimes like get out of it and go, who the fuck wrote that? Like it just almost like it comes from somewhere else. I uh, I think that it's almost like, this sounds really trippy. Um, but I think a lot of this stuff, and well here you're on stage and you say something that he never said before and it's not even derivative. It's not something, you know, I mean your buddies and you are, you guys discuss, it's a brand new thought.

Speaker 6:          02:33:48       You kind of feel like it's just there already and it's like this, this, this stream and then you reach up and you grab it. And the big part of it is trying to, I can't believe I'm not not dilauded right now, but the big part of it is, is getting yourself out of the way so you can just grab that stuff. That's a great way to describe it, you know, because cause cause you know, I'm, I'm terrible, I'm a failure. I'm a hack. This has all been done before. Nobody likes me. You know. It's so exhausting excel and that stuff's just having a big ego in reverse. You know? It's still a big ego.

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're thinking about yourself instead of thinking about what you're doing or going zen and focusing on, yeah. It just makes stuff that's, it should be a shirt, you know, make stuff or just make stuff,

Speaker 6:          02:34:28       you know, the other cliche, it's true. You know, you're feeling bad, you know, you do something good.

Speaker 1:          02:34:36       Yeah. This, uh, this, did you ever read a, any, uh, Pressfield's the war of art? He talks about the Muse, you know, and he talks about and treats it like it's a real thing and it's a kind of an interesting idea because what know, people think of the Muse, you know, that like, and the idea is that there's something that gives you these ideas for something that you pay tribute to and then it, it gives you ideas. Right. He actually asked sort of actively courts it like, he actively like says like a, you know, I'm going to respect the muse. I'm going to show up at work every day, you know, and I'm going to put in the hours and when I put in the hours, the musical come. Yeah. And like he sort of, his philosophy on it was very enlightening and it, and it's also very, um, the, it's, it's, it's, it's inspiring because it makes you want to write, it makes you want to create and it makes you want it. Like that attitude is a very beneficial attitude to have. It's sort of spiritual and Mumbo jumbo and kinda crazy. No, that's not right.

Speaker 6:          02:35:33       I say the nicest compliment I've ever received, uh, as this friend of mine who, who, uh, Tom Link I think, and he, he, he, he saw a movie of mine and he, and he said, I want to go. Right. Ah, yeah. That's great. And I was like, oh, that's nice. I always feel that way when we're cynical me. He's like, what? He thought

Speaker 7:          02:35:52       better now, dirty prick again though.

Speaker 6:          02:35:56       No, I was like, that was the nicest thing anyone's ever said, I think after a movie. Yeah. Yeah. That is, uh, one of the coolest things about other artists to create more of it. I truly don't know when I'm making these movies, uh, what they're about later on I'll say, oh, that's this character, that's this person in my life and I have no idea until after they're done and I'm watching him, like my wife was like, you didn't get that. This is just pretty, or people playing you and me.

Speaker 7:          02:36:27       Yeah.
