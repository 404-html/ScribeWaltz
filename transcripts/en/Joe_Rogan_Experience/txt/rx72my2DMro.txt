Speaker 1:          00:00:00       This episode of the podcast is the last remaining podcasts from the Joe Rogan questions. Everything side five show, we'll we do another episode of that show. I have no idea. It's up for debate. It's in talks. We've tried to figure out another way to do it that doesn't involve driving to weird places are flying in to meet a bunch of shitheads who are aligned to us about whether or not they've been abducted by aliens or seen big foot or that was the primary problem that we had with that television show. The big problem that I had with it was I didn't want to do a show where we were just running around debunking things. I wanted to do a show where we were talking to people that that brought up questions that I thought was actually, that I thought were actually fascinating, that people that really had information that stimulated your curiosity and I really didn't find that too much.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       We, we've found that with the real subjects. We found that with the subjects like transhumanism, when we talk to these people that really were interested in pushing the boundaries of technology, um, with those folks, we really did have a interesting conversations. We really did cover subjects that I thought were worthy of your time, of your energy, of your viewing and listening pleasure. Um, but far too often what we dealt with was a, a bunch of lost people that were completely fixated on ideas that were probably nonsense and I didn't want to do that anymore, but I did enjoy doing know was doing the podcast aspect of it. I really did enjoy talking to Dunkin. I really did enjoy hanging out with him and having a good time just goofing on life, goofing on the situations that we found ourselves in. And one of the situations was when we went to this place called skin Walker ranch and skin Walker ranch.

Speaker 1:          00:02:10       Is this a place that's out in the middle of Utah? And uh, we flew out there and met with this questionable individual who, uh, I think it's safe to say is at least mostly full of shit. But the, the, the trip was still fun and talking about it was fun and, and just talking about it was what I found to be the, just the, not just the most fun part of doing the show for me, but the most entertaining part of the show was exploring these ideas with an intelligent guy like Dunkin. Um, so whether or not the show moves on, I will definitely continue to do things like that with Dunkin. So this is the last podcast and this episode is brought to you by audible.

Speaker 2:          00:05:06       Logan Experience Joe Rogan podcast all day. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:20       Are we rolling? We good? Yup. Yeah, I'll smoke is in here. All right. Looking at this, this is the fog of confusion. That's what's in the air dock and the fog of confusion. Yeah. The smoke of mystery. Mm. Um, so we went to Skin Walker branch and uh, we found a lot of crazy. Yes. Find a lot of crazy. Yes. It was a, an interesting place. I'll tell you what, Mike Miller, the, the gentleman that we talked to that, uh, lived with his cool dog and had seen the orbs. Yes. That guy I enjoy talking to. He seemed like a real to earth guy that had no reason to lie to us. He didn't seem like he had any agenda and his story, although sounds completely crazy while he was saying it did not seem in any way like he was being deceptive. It seemed like he was telling us a real account.

Speaker 1:          00:06:15       It's, I know he was like, I know it sounds crazy, but it's what I saw and I believe him. I mean, I believe that he had this experience, what it was, who, you know, you would have to be there, you'd have to see it. And even then, if you saw what he saw, the way he explained it, you wouldn't really know. And I think that's a real problem with any completely unique experience if you had it. And no one else had it. What kind of a burden? You know, walking around, like you've seen these rainbow colored orbs that are the size of softballs and they're flying around your house and going through walls and your dog's looking at them and you're shining lights on them and they're avoiding the lights and flying around. What do you do? It's over. It's gone. They leave. You're back to just sit at home.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       The TV still on, your dog's still there and you and all of a sudden, you know you're forced with this decision, like what you're faced with this decision. What do you do? You'd tell your friends about this and he keep that to yourself. What would you do if you saw a bunch of crazy orbs flying or in your car and then disappearing off into space and then virtue and you know other than your own strange memory of what just happened? Life is exactly the same. What do you do? Do you tell people? Yeah. You tell people you've got a responsibility to tell people. You've got to be brave enough to tell people, because if you don't tell people, then you're discrediting, ah, your species. If there's some kind of brand new thing that's happening that no one's observed before and you see it, you've got to have the guts to get out there and tell people.

Speaker 1:          00:07:51       Sure. They're just going to look at you like, oh, this is the typical dusty see meant Lang desert recluse with a filthy dog who's been huffing paint and hallucinating warps. That's all anyone's going to think. That's the problem. But I think that you must help people because if you don't, then no one's going to investigate it. And if no one investigates it, then these things will remain in the land of the crazy instead of coming into the light. And if they come into the light, think of what that would do to all of society. If we can prove that there's hyper dimensional orbs that traverse wormholes to communicate with dusty old cowboys in the middle of Mormon country. Wow. What a great way of putting it. Yeah. And, and if they really are some unique thing that we are experiencing for the first time, but we'll continue to show itself and eventually become, you know, factual eventually be a part of, I dunno what we consider reality, you know, you would be so pissed. You're like, I saw that too and I

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       didn't have the balls to speak out. That's right. And what if Marconi never spoke out when he started discovering radio waves? What if Darwin never spoke out when he recognized that there was a process called evolution that was happening in the world? What if Edison never spoke out when he was, uh, uh, stealing Tesla's ideas? Yeah. You know, and it's really interesting because when you stop and think about what you're talking about, this flying thing, you know, why is that any stranger than fish? Why is it any stranger than some thing that breeze water and does whatever it wants in this three dimensional world under the ocean, right. Why isn't any weirder than birds? Yeah. Why is that any weirder than, I saw an eagle the other day when I was in Seattle. So on the eagle flying knife faced death machine. Yeah. That was a dinosaur that survived.

Speaker 3:          00:09:48       It survived and figured out how to fly and steel fish from the water. Yeah. If someone came out to me and said, listen, uh, and I'd never seen an eagle, and they're like, which do you think Israel, a floating orb that is alive and follows you or a thing that evolved from lizards that has a knife on its face and flies through the sky killing fish. Yeah. It has like, like like bone cutters. Yes. It's even sicker than a knife. It's a pair of scissors. It's a flying pair of scissors. A giant scissors faced Munster from 65 million years ago. Yeah. That carries away your cat, your Chihuahua and survived a giant five mile wide chunk of stone and metal. It's slammed into the earth and killed just about everything except these country flying lizards. Yes, exactly. And also look, go down under the ocean, go down into the deep, deep parts of the ocean where you see those creepy glowing Goblin things that just live down there.

Speaker 3:          00:10:48       Absolutely. There's things that are live. There's self luminescent or we'll bio luminescent like they glow. They make light underneath the water. How crazy is that? Why is that any crazier than, why is a flying orb crazy than that? It's really not. Especially when you consider what that orb did. It's not like that orb stole his cat and flew away within eight it on top of a rock like an eagle would write. An Eagle would steal your cat, man. No problem. Eagle has no problem. You leave a baby alone with an ego. Watch what happens. Sure. It'll be crazy. Yeah, it's crazy man. And, and but here's the difference. Or if it's just fly around the baby and take off, nobody gets hurt. We don't know. Maybe the orbs plant seeds in the baby. The thought of the baby change the way the mind works and the ties the baby. Maybe the orbs drive the baby. Insane. But we, the, the difference of course is that there's a million pictures of eagles. There's very few pictures of orbs. There's a million pictures of undersea death goblins that glow. No pictures of Ufo. So there's photos of orbs. There's photos that people put online that they claim to be orbs.

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       The problem is they're very much like our guide in, in Utah, the the, you know, I don't know me, maybe everything he said was a hundred percent factual, but it was so crazy to hear someone who says they've seen big foot, they've seen orbs and bulletproof Wolfe's. They've seen all these things themselves and they're telling you it's just a spot. This is the squeezebox. Maybe he's telling the truth but it's so fantastical. And that is the sort of the same thing that comes along with all of these, all of these tales, whether it's orbs or wolves or, or any of the crazy things that we were told that these people saw. If they are real, you're dealing with some crazy, unique experience that really I commend you for coming out and talking about it. Cause I might keep my mouth shut. I probably wouldn't, I'm pretty stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:12:45       I would definitely talk about it. If I saw something cool, I would try I or am I talking about it? I would talk about it, but some people didn't want to talk to us. And I could understand that first couple that we meant that we were supposed to talk and then the day of shooting they got cold feet and they were like, you know what? We don't even want to talk about this. It's like the last thing I want to do is be that person on TV talking about something duddy and they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're not not doing it. Like they just were done with it. They thought about it, probably kept him up all night, wisely cell. But uh, Mike didn't give a fuck. You know what man? Yeah. He didn't give a fuck. It didn't bother him at all.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       And he told it to us, just matter of fact, and I was with them every step of the way. I believe that guy was telling us at true encounter. Oh, I don't know what it was. I don't know what made me, who knows? He might have had like a misfiring of like several key elements of his brain. Sure. And they might start producing hallucinations in front of them. Who knows how much whiskey he drank right before he saw these orbs. Yeah. Who knows? Who knows what cold medicines. He mixed up a lot. Who knows? But the bottom line is this guy, when he was telling us about this, I believed them and if you and I had just gotten to see it, man, what a world changing event that would be, but that seems to be a part of the narrative of all this really crazy fantastical stuff. It's like if you could be there and see it, boy would just change the world. But when you go look in, nobody finds shit ever, ever, ever. It doesn't matter if you're looking for big foot, if you're looking for Ufo woes, if you're trying to find the loch ness monster, you never fine shit. People finance these giant missions. They take these [inaudible] radar machines,

Speaker 4:          00:14:33       troll the lock in Scotland every couple of years they spend so much money looking for something that's probably never been there. But that's, that's what we do. That's what human beings do is we try to expand our understanding of the universe and part of that means

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       investigating claims of bizarre creatures and aliens and Ufos. We have to investigate it, but the difference between science and these people is science is comfortable with what they call a null hypothesis. They're comfortable coming back with no results and saying it's not there. The thing that these people don't seem capable of, or at least the guy who had seen the bulletproof wolf and big foot and everything is he saw everything. He hit the supernatural lottery. He saw big foot the first night he went looking. Yeah. The first night, there are people up there, there are people up there for years, slowly going crazy under the moon. This guy goes out one night, bigfoot shows up, did some calls that he learned from watching TV, TV, bigfoot show. So you know, man, the problem is that those people are under super lucky. Their problem is they're just lucky. Super Lucky.

Speaker 1:          00:15:47       She's, he's a magnet for paranormal activity. Yeah, that's, that's definitely what it is. That's what he is. He's a magnet for the paranormal. I just think that he is. That would be hilarious if it was. It was just like this guy who is just, you know, not the most charismatic guy, doesn't seem like you know any different than you or I, but yet the aliens just decided, this is our guy. This is why he's our go to dude. Don't be an alcoholic. Well, maybe this is why don't live around really stupid people because maybe the aliens landed in his town and everybody else is like barely a monkey. They're just apes. Apes with a language and him in his town, he's the dawn of the town, like he's the smartest guy for miles. It's a rough town. They'd looked around and they said, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:16:33       This is our guy. You know, they maybe they didn't do a really good, accurate assessment of the entire population and find out who's the smartest guy here. Okay, let's go talk to Neil degrasse Tyson. He seems to be totally on the ball. He seems like the best guy we could communicate with. No, they showed up in some meth adult shit hole of a town and it's fucking tumbleweeds flying by and people shooting up in the corners and it's just a mess everywhere you look. Gambling addicts are stealing money and everyone's on some fucking form crank and uh, they found all Ryan Ryan was washing his truck and listen to like conservative talk radio. We seem to stock seems like a normal guy and they're like, we found the guy. This is the best America has to offer. They just didn't. They look at us like we're so stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:17:20       Like the way we look at Champs, I mean it takes a long time studying chimps for you, figuring out what's the bad motherfucker champ, what's the one champ that figured out how to take the stick and widdle the end of it so he can get the ants easier? You know what, what does the one chimp that figured out how to mimic human behavior and do certain things, it takes a long time to find that guy. So if there's so much more advanced than us than we are from champs, if it's like that much of a leap, they probably look at these idiots. They probably look at it, this is a sea of idiots

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       or I find this one idiot that's not eating his own poop. Oh let's grab that guy and scoop him up and let's show him everything was show him everything and see if he can, uh, you know, perhaps a help us enlighten this crazy species. Man, you're, I think you're right. Cause in by being, by the way, if I'm studying champs, I'm going to pick the crazy one because it's more interesting. Who are you going to take the normal champs? You're going to take the chimp. It's off by himself, by a tree drinking many vodkas and staring into the sun, making weird noises to summon a mythical creature. I get that day's sitting an Indian casino way drunker than any buddy should be and be allowed to walk on their own screaming expletives cause they lost all the money they've ever made ever on a game of chance.

Speaker 3:          00:18:35       Yeah, exactly. That's the chimp you want to study. Maybe aliens don't believe in crazy people and they try to prove the crazy people exist by finding them and taking pictures of them may be aliens are smart enough to avoid credible people. Then they figured the best way to get the information they need is to find someone who already has a pension for stretching the truth and a duck. That motherfucker, and then when you're done with them, go, go tell your friends, tell everyone, go tell your friends. That's what they say. They put them on the front door and they go, go ahead. Go tell your friends, dude. And he's just sitting there like, fuck. Hey, you dropped your tequila bottle. Don't forget your Tequila when you leave. Oh, don't worry. You've got plenty of meth in your urine. You're going to come up clean. Get outta here, dude.

Speaker 3:          00:19:21       So the guy goes to the police department and tells a story, pisses in a cop, and they go, get the fuck outta here. What's in here? This can get me how I could drink this and get high for a month. Feed it. Get out of here. Scrammed storyteller. It's really smart. It's genius. It's a genius thing to do. It's true. The last thing you want to do is have duct some logical. Yeah, Obama have. Obama feels compelled to tell the world and they actually listen. People alter their behavior. Start looking for Ufo is put on special glasses like and they live. Remember that movie? Rowdy Roddy Piper, John Carpenter at school. No one's gonna believe Obama. How dare you? No one believes it when he talks about anything alien. Maybe that would be perfect. That will be the ultimate cover. Come straight to Obama and that's the one thing they'd be like, everybody's like, you know what, this guy, we got to get them out of office. Like everybody's fine with drones. Everybody's fine with paying off the banks. Everybody's fine with arresting people for medical marijuana. Everybody's fine with everything, but he says he saw a Ufo. This motherfucker goods, get him out of here.

Speaker 3:          00:20:21       God, that'd be fun to be an alien. Wouldn't are. You get to get to suck anybody into your ship and do anything you want to them. No one can call the police. Just drop them off. Go, go tell your friends. Yeah. Tell her to shreds. By the way, we're invisible to everybody, but you know, I mean you don't think that they can make you invisible. I mean, it seems to me that if you can come here from another planet, pretty much you do anything. Whatever you can manipulate in our world. You, you know, you might

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       be a bulletproof wolf. Maybe that's like the best way to show up. Sure. See a wolf that you can go ahead, shoot me. You pretend that they hurt you and then you fly away. He turned into mist and you vanish. Why don't we, why would we assume that they're limited in their ability to exist in, in matter the way we are just contained by this biological prison. Yeah. Maybe they can be missed shipment. Maybe they can do it. Maybe they just appear out of nowhere. I mean, they don't get in big stupid ships like we do and fly through the air. Maybe they're like, oh my God, they're still doing that. Do you know, do you can just become mist and appear as like a wolf or something? Yes. Maybe they do that. I mean, why not? Wouldn't you know, that's, listen, if, now this is a big if, but one of the gentlemen that I talked to, um, to real, what's his first name?

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       Rich Terrile. One of the gentleman that I talked to, this guy, rich to real. It's from the JPL labs. All right. This guy's super smart. Jpl Lamb. I don't know what they do there, but it's very important. Very important rocket sciency type stuff. Yeah. Well we were talking about simulation theory and one of the things brought up about simulation theory was if you don't know that you're in a simulation and as you're in that simulation you create another simulation. Like what did that sort of mimic the fractal behavior that the whole universe seems to exist or seems to, seems to show that exists everywhere. Everywhere you look, whether it's the FIBONACCI sequence, the way it applied self to sunflower seeds, or just the fact that you go into the atoms themselves and there's so much space there. Yes. It's almost like the, uh, like the universe. And if that's the case and if what we're looking at is just a representation of an artificially created world and inside that artificially created world, we're working feverishly to create another artificial world.

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       If that's the case, then maybe alien life is just simply someone who decides to present itself as that inside the simulation. I mean, if we really are a completely in a world of ones and Zeros, we may really be limited by our imagination more than we're limited by possibilities. We just seem to only be capable of imagining things that someone has already documented, whether it's a tiger or a shark or a tornado, it's these things are documented, so we'll accept them. But maybe if it's a simulation, there's some shit out there that we just haven't seen in the game yet. Yeah, there's some new levels to the movie where you, you know, you pass this area and all of a sudden you're in a magic land and bulletproof walls exist and turn out a mist and they land on your porch and they look at you and you shoot him in. They vanish.

Speaker 4:          00:23:33       I mean, the uh, ability to have wireless communication existed when people were beating each other's heads and with rocks and worshiping golden the same time

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       always been there. It's just they hadn't discovered it yet. So it's true. No doubt there's some amazing technology or some amazing, uh, law in the universe that we haven't quite discovered yet that eventually we will, that will be as disruptive to society is every other invention or discovery like that. But these discoveries are not made generally by people who stink of Jen.

Speaker 1:          00:24:13       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:24:14       And who go wandering drunk through the desert, staring up into space. These discoveries are made by people who have an inclination and impulse and I've studied a lot of science and know the process that you can uncover these laws, which is why it's so important to approach these things from a scientific perspective because otherwise you end up with an unprovable thing. Maybe you saw something, but the fact that you're not approaching it scientifically immediately discredits you.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       You said something that was very important and I want to reassert it. You said that the ability to communicate wirelessly always existed. We just hadn't figured it out yet. Yes, but it always existed just we didn't have the technology to unearth it. That's such an important point that you made and I don't think people could really wrap their head around that. It's really hard to, we can sort of see the future like a little bit in the future, like we think about it, but whenever we've tried to guess, we're always so off, you know? Like do you ever watch space? 1999 now. I was a great show. It was a great show, but it was 14 years ago supposedly. I mean the show is made in the 70s or the eighties or something like, I think it was the 70s and it was supposed to be about the future and in 1999 like space 1999 this is going to be crazy.

Speaker 1:          00:25:37       We're just going to be living in the galaxy in 1999 like there's so off. Everybody's always off. But you know what? They never saw on space down at 99 Google. Right. They didn't have all the answers. They didn't know where they were going. They couldn't, they didn't have navigation systems. They didn't have any of that shit. They didn't have cell phones. Okay. They talked to each other. It was like a walkie talkie type situation, you know, like in the and the enterprise Kirk out. No, nobody saw what we have right now. That is completely insane. That's right. I mean, we literally have the power of immortals. If we lived a thousand years ago, we would be some strange freak existence that, you know, people had never seen a guy with a cell phone, never seen a guy in a car pull up with a cell phone, never see a guy step out with sunglasses on and have a machine gun in his hand. All the things that we have today that seemed like an insane, impossible, unimaginable things a thousand years ago. They're totally, completely 100% common.

Speaker 5:          00:26:35       Yeah. You take, you pluck someone from a thousand years ago and drop them into any city in the world and they might go crazy

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       or pluck someone from a thousand years the future and who knows what kind of shape you can take. Right? Who knows what, what, you know, whether or not you, you can even tell a port consciousness into other objects and ideas. We have no idea what's going to be possible. And once they start figuring out a way to, to put technology deeper and deeper into our lives or we ever become part technology ourselves. Some form of Cyborg. Yeah. Anything is fucking possible when that happen.

Speaker 5:          00:27:09       That's right. Anything's possible. And it's the people who have the most open minds that end up making the discoveries that transform history. So that's why it's important for people to not be afraid to explore these things. It's just the way you explore it. It's gotta be precise, right? Because if you aren't precise, then you end up in a lot of trouble. I mean, it's best case you end up wandering through the desert. Maybe you fall into an ants nest cause you're a little too drunk and you know, you go home with some stinks. Worst case, you've got a little bit more charisma than that Fella had, you know? And then you start telling other people like you that you can communicate with bigfoot and they all say what? Really? Yeah, I communicate with big foot and he told me that I should start a church.

Speaker 5:          00:27:53       And the next thing you know, you've got someone who's started a new religion about worshiping bigfoot, surrounded by equally nutty people who have no interest in proving anything at all. And then that's how religions start. And then you know what inevitably happens next? The person says that big foot came to them and a dream and said that they have to have sex with your wife. I don't know why he wants me to do that, but he wants me to do that. He wants me to do that. Or the bulletproof wolf will come and that's how religion started. That's how it starts, man. And that's why it's dangerous. And that's why people like that have to be held to actual scientific principles. Because if they're not, then they can cause a lot of problems.

Speaker 1:          00:28:39       That's awesome. Why were we talked about before? It's important to hang out with people that are smart. If you hang out with a bunch of dumb people, especially if you're that guy, if you can just tell them things like that, like you met a bulletproof wolf and like, Whoa, where's the wolf? You tell that guy anyway. You'd start making things up just to keep yourself entertained because you're, you're dealing with uh, an ape. You know your friends and ape. Right and completely stupid. There's people out there that'll just like that.

Speaker 5:          00:29:03       Once you have a person near you who believes that you saw a bulletproof messed wolf, you can definitely get them to give you a blow job.

Speaker 1:          00:29:13       Easy, easy, easy. You could tell them that the aliens told them that you have to give them a blowjob or everyone will die. Yeah. Baby's first.

Speaker 5:          00:29:22       Yeah, you got to do it. Get up there. I don't want to, by the way, I don't want you to give me a blowjob. This hurts.

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       Last thing I want, but if you don't, all the babies die. Yeah. His thing eats babies and it's going to come from a wormhole. Alright. Where am are great too, because you don't have to show a launch area. You don't have to like pretend that there's like a secret spot where you got to go to. You know when it's, when it's a wormhole with something as simple as a worm hall just sits there. It's not whatever. Yeah. I'm sorry. What's round? Every time you move you put it on the unsightly me. This on the cable? Yeah. Every time we move the cable connecting. Oh, okay. Here I'll put it in the front. Thank you. No problem. Okay. Babies and monsters. Do you want to talk? Where was I? You were talking babies

Speaker 5:          00:30:18       baby. Yeah. You were saying? Yeah. You were saying that you convince these people that the bulletproof wolf eats babies if they don't give you blowjobs. Yeah, it's not likely, but it probably could happen. It's not likely. I mean God, look at religion. Look at religion. I mean I was just telling you about this on the, I don't know if I was just telling you about this on the phone, but Joseph Smith. Yeah. What? Tell girls that they had to marry him or they would be damned to hell. Now what's the difference? It's, see that's the problem. If someone had gone to him and said, look, you've got to prove this thing telling you that you can have sex with my daughter before you have sex with her. I want some proof. Measure it. Show me the tablets I want is, I want to know who this thing is. It's telling you that you to stick your penis and my daughter religiously, you know, you have to hold people accountable for stuff like that or they will hum pew. That's the inevitable result of this man. The slippery slope ends with you laying back in the desert with some guys sitting on your face like a saddle is lumping your mouth kind of

Speaker 1:          00:31:21       doesn't roll. Kind of all go back to what we discovered when we went looking for big foot. It's really, it's kind of, there's a similar thing going on because it's all people that are getting very little physical affection, you know? And this is why they have the free time to be out there looking for Ufo. Yeah. It's like nobody wants to fuck them. And so because of that you develop this deficit. This is a desperate need for mystery. Desperate need to somehow another validate the emptiness that is regular, normal life with big foot or with Ufo shows or with fill in the blank. What or whatever crazy thing you blink Jervis, Jersey Devil, what do you believe in? Loch ness, monster, UFO abduction. Well, whatever it is, reputation, all of it. Channeling, so she's a channel or in a healer. Oh really?

Speaker 5:          00:32:15       It's very frightening of you cause that's what you, it's like from a Freudian perspective, what you're saying is that they're oppressed sex drive manifests in these kind of the hallucinations or wish fulfillment, illusions, delusions and you know also I think it puts you in a community of people that are also idiots are more likely to hump here because? Because I like more gullible.

Speaker 1:          00:32:39       Yeah and easier to have sex with because they're gullible because they lack critical thinking skills and you can tell them crazy stories. They're much more likely to have sex with you. It's not a new idea. It's not a bad idea. Look if we know that the primary motivation for most males 18 to 34 or whatever the hell it is, demo is spreading, spreading, and spreading sexuality, getting, getting into position to have as much sex as possible, as often as possible with people that are as pretty as possible. We all agree to that. We know that it's the motivation behind flashy cars and jewelry and $50,000 watches. If there's only men on the planet. Do you think they sell any $50,000 watches? No. No one would buy one. We wouldn't give a fuck. No one's going to have sex with you. You know, unless you're gay, you wouldn't buy that watch.

Speaker 1:          00:33:27       Okay? But if you factor in all the reasons why people do all the things they do, buy the biggest house where the flat, fanciest clothes, he's always sharp. What? He's, they're setting themselves up to be a primary sexual candidate and when that no longer applies, where's your motivation for life? Where's your motivation to get up in the morning? What do you, what are you doing? What's going on in there? There's no more libido and you're not even remotely attractive so you can either scrape up enough money doing what you do really good and pay for it, which always feels gross. I'm sure never done it. Never. Well me. You know what I'm saying? Even if I did what I'm saying is it would be sad. It was sad to be some 60 year old dude who worked his whole life to put together a meager bank roll and every couple of months he blows some of it on an escort and in between that he's looking for Ufo was to stay out there too.

Speaker 1:          00:34:22       We've got, we were basically locked down. We've got a hundred percent proof now. What we got here is a smoking gun. This guy actually told us and signed an affidavit. We got the gun, we got the smoking gun. That's right here. Look, it's been done. If you don't believe in Ufo Ufos, you're crazy. Okay, cause we got it all. We've got it here. We got it now because he's a very exciting time. Yeah, they released this information is going to be no denying. We've got top level people from all areas of the government who come out with amazing stories. And once you hear those stories and it will be undeniable, and then they give themselves just like sense of excitement along with reciting this stuff and talking about this stuff. These mysteries are getting young covered, but they never tell him to have her do. It's a mating dance. It's part of the mating dance. It's like a tail. They pop up the book, big foot tail feather, pop up the Ufo tail feather at you do that after a few drinks, you know, and it kind of dark bar you'd say like, look, I don't tell a lot of people, but I had an incredible encounter in the desert a few weeks ago. And uh, look, I, I probably shouldn't tell you know what, what happened? Um, well first it started off as a mist.

Speaker 1:          00:35:36       You know, you're at,

Speaker 5:          00:35:40       it turned into a wolf and then you started a little, maybe a little crying, like you're a little upset about it. Next thing you know, you're back in the days in enjoying a nice roll in the Hay with somebody that you've probably drugged.

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       You know what's weird about the people that tell these stories to, this is one thing that I've been noticing. There's people that will tell these stories and they'll tell it to you in a way where you feel like they're recounting a memory. You know, like Mike Miller, that's his name, right? Like know, like Mike Miller, he fell to me that he was recounting a memory, but other people that we talk to just we're saying a bunch of words in order. It's like it was complete. There's a complete flatness to the way they described these encounters that doesn't register with you at all. Like did talk to you. They're like, well, I went into the woods and we started doing these sacred howl and uh, all of a sudden we saw the, um, the pyramid in the sky opened up and a from it came this alien craft and you're just hearing a bunch of words.

Speaker 1:          00:36:43       You don't, there's, there's nothing connected to this person is there's nothing connecting them with that story. And there's nothing connecting you with that story. They're not trying to connect you with that story to trying to say the words in order that they think would make sense if you were talking about a crazy incident that happened, but it was clearly an incident that didn't really happen to them. And there's a sense that we all have for that. It's not bulletproof. It's not, it's not 100% but this is a sense that you have when someone's telling you a story where you know they're full of shit. Yes. And uh, that's a weird thing. It's a weird thing to be in front of people when you know they're not telling you the truth, but we all know what it's like. W We, it's not that people can't trick us.

Speaker 1:          00:37:25       People certainly can trick you, but when you know someone's full of Shit, you really do know they're full of shit. You know what I'm saying? It's not 100% it doesn't work with everyone. And there are people that are sociopaths. They are people that are really good at lying. There are people that are very charismatic and can con people that can steal your money then yes. Bill, you either they're experts at lying. Sure. Actors. I mean what, what are, what does being an actor is being a liar? Yeah. You know, I'm not saying that they would lose it in their personal life, but Daniel Day Lewis would be the greatest fucking liar and the history of the world's thinking about how good that guy will be at lying to you. You know, did you spill the milk and he comes down and he looks like he has an eat in a week.

Speaker 1:          00:38:03       He's fucking hobbling and yeah, cause it shits his pants while he's talking to you. You know, that guy would, you'd be like, oh for sure. That guy didn't spell them out for lie. He's telling me the truth. He's crying as poor guy has like he's got cerebral palsy or something. Yeah. Let me take him to the bathroom and clean him up and he punches you in the face and rapes you. You know why? Cause he was faking it the whole time. He just wanted to get you to where you were alone with them in a bathroom washing his ass, cause he can't wash it himself and then he just beats the shit

Speaker 5:          00:38:28       we doing. This is like our erotic Daniel Day, Lewis and fiction. I don't even know what it is. Like you didn't even know I'm doing or you went

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       down the road. How did he end up in your house? We started talking. I just made all that up. But that's, that's the universe giving me a little gift. It's a gift of, it's called creativity. I love the idea and over comes from, it's just a gift. I love the, this is my, I love the idea of like someone spilled milk. Daniel Day Lewis comes in, you know, did you spill the milk? He's like, no, suddenly you're washing his asshole. He shits all over himself cause he's scared because he's scared him. He pretends that he's really sick and feeble and you, you yelled at him. So he just defecates all over himself. He's crying but he can't wash himself. And that's one of the reasons, I mean snots coming out of his nose, he's weeping. He can't even breathe. He's doing it so well. You feel terrible and you're like, we'll clean you up on it. We'll clean you up. So as you're cleaning, he just beats the shit out of you on fucks your mouth.

Speaker 3:          00:39:24       He holds you down, just punches you in the face until you're unconscious and you know you wake up because you can't breathe out of your mouth because it's filled with caulk. Try to get some air through your nose. What? Daniel Day Lewis, just fucking your mouth. Why? Because he's an awesome liar. He tricked you. He got you a bitch again. And I think that that, I think that's one of the most important things a person can talk about. Points that I think that's the important point is that there is a slippery slope when you're around a wire that we'll end with that liars cock in their math. But I think there's this, there's a real slippery slope with human beings. If you are around someone who's trying to be deceptive in order to profit on something or trick you into something, someone who gets really good at figuring out how to pretend that they're something they're not, or they seen something they haven't just in order to get something from you, whether it's your attention or whether it's your money.

Speaker 3:          00:40:22       There's a weird thing where people realize like, oh, I don't have to tell the truth. What I have to do is just make up a good story that allows me to get into a situation or I'm on TV telling this story yet. And so that's what they do. They just sort of like lumped together this idea in their head and maybe they rehearse it, maybe they wing it, and in that case you just keep asking him about it over and over again over a long period of time. And they slowly start. It's twisting that story around because they don't remember what the hell they told you. Listen, there's so much money in it, man. I show much money if bills. Look at the Vatican. I mean, my God, the moment you can convince people that you're in contact with a thing you can't take pictures of or prove and they believe you, you are loaded. You can get so rich and religion has shown this again and again and again. I mean these people take it to the nth degree. There are these, you know, the people we ran into in the desert, the guy thinks he saw a wolf that turns into mist and big foot. If we drive 10 miles in any direction and go to a church, I can sit you down with a person who thinks that there is living in the sky

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       and invisible man that is going to destroy all of humanity. Uh, it's all going to happen in Israel. Now that's within 15 miles in the difference between the guy wandering drunk in the desert and the person wearing the funny priest outfit is the priest has people who give him money every week to listen to that story. They drop it in the, they drop it in the collections plate and send that thing around and just listen to that story again and again. The man in the sky forgives you sins and he comes down, he comes down. If we're all good and ready, he'll come down and take us away from this terrible planet. No more bulletproof Wolfe's, no more big foot's just peace and love forever. That's a gigantic business right now. Those people don't even have to pay taxes. There's such good liars. Did they have convinced the United States government to not take taxes from their multibillion dollar businesses? Wow. That's amazing. And that's the end of the thing. And that's the end of the thing. So they're the same thing. They're, they're on the spectrum. They're the successful version of it. The non successful version is the guy who stinks of Gen wandering through the forest pointing at mud puddles and telling you it's big foot footprint. The successful version of it is the guy wearing robes and gold and sitting in a golden throne and telling the planet that they shouldn't, where birth control.

Speaker 1:          00:43:00       Yeah. I think you're right. Totally makes sense. These guys, um, it's almost like they can't help themselves. Have you noticed that? It's almost like no matter what you talk about, they just have a story. It just comes out. All right. Well, the ones that are telling like a lot of stories, that's why you know, it's always, they don't just see one thing. Oh, they've seen chew Bekaa Bros, they've seen nessie. They were on vacation in Scotland. We saw nessie triple dog, dare you. They've seen everything. They can't even help themselves. Oh No, thank you. Thank you. Want to tell you a state want to lie to you?

Speaker 5:          00:43:31       Well, it's, you know, I think there's an evolutionary advantage to it and I think that the moment you begin to realize if you're okay with telling lies, you start making tons of money and people will start having sex with you, then you could see how there's like a profound evolutionary advantage to being a liar. And the ultimate liar is the liar believes that himself, who's told himself the story so much that he started seeing it. There's a huge evolutionary advantage to this sort of thing. So I, I, that all being said, the real problem here is that in this sea of horny liars, there's a few people who've seen something real.

Speaker 1:          00:44:05       You think? Yes. Okay. If you had to put all your eggs in a basket and pick D, I'm going to give you three subjects, ghosts, big foot and aliens. Okay. What are those? Which one of those do you think that anybody has ever seen a re had a real experience, a real experience or actually something actually happened? I think people have seen hyper dimensional

Speaker 5:          00:44:32       entities, uh, that could be classified as ghosts or aliens.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       Do you think that they've seen these while sober? No. That's the problem though, isn't it? There's a variety of chemicals that radically affect the way you see reality. And so the real problem is do we just set as a standard the level of chemicals that exists in a normal human being without any outside help? And we'll call that like the baseline. Yeah. Do we accept that or tweaked out of their Gourd on magic mushrooms? Because that's also a state of consciousness a human can achieve if they consume the right foods. I mean that it really is what your experience. So if you under that situation have a real honest to goodness alien encounter where you exchange information and you come out of it a better person, like in enlightened by the face of this experience, even if it didn't really happen, it still happened in your mind. That's right. It's still something you experienced. That's right. So that could be an entity. Well

Speaker 5:          00:45:41       this is why we need a NASA for psychedelics because that's when people are experiencing these, these experiencing these things. Let's explore it. And I think you know a lot of people, and I, you know, I've done this myself. When someone tells you a crazy story of like what are you high like that does credits the person. But what if the mind is an antenna and what of certain chemicals allow you to tune in to other frequencies that exist around us at all time. And everyone knows that we're surrounded right now by all kinds of invisible frequencies, ultraviolet light, radio waves, wireless signals. We are in an ocean of information washing around is that our computers and our technology, we're able to translate to digitize and put it in a form that the human mind can understand. So in the same way the human mind, it's a biocomputer and maybe these psychedelics create an upgrade to the operating system that allows a temporary window into the unknown.

Speaker 5:          00:46:37       And when you see that and you come back to this world and talk about it, people think you're nuts because you can't take pictures of something that, uh, your mind is seeing after it's gone into a specific state of intoxication. You can only take pictures by describing it. Now also, if you believe that psychedelics can rewire the mind to allow us to see the, uh, the invisible world that exists around us at all times, then maybe people who are a little crazy, these things poking out from behind the lattice of reality. Maybe they do see it in the same way that when a person who isn't crazy, for lack of a better word, take psychedelics. So in that way, perhaps the lens of our perception when it's altered in some way, whether because you're a little on

Speaker 3:          00:47:30       the naughty side or because you've taken some mushrooms, maybe when that Lens has shifted, it allows us to see so much more. Yeah, that's very possible. It's very possible that that's exactly what's happening in this area in Utah as well, because this area, besides having this one spot where everybody claims all these events are happening, you know what else it has around their cattle, cattle all over the place. The guy had a cattle ranch, this cat, we drove past several ranches where this cattle and with his cattle, this cow shit. Yep. And with his cow shit. In a place where it rains all the time, there's a party, there's a party. You're going to get some magic mushrooms growing in the cow shit and a if that's all you're doing, you're just hanging out in the middle of nowhere in Utah eating mushrooms, staring at the rocks, you're going to see some shit.

Speaker 3:          00:48:22       Look, man, I've told you this story before. I've eaten my shrimps. I've been attacked by elves. I've seen hyper dimensional entities. I was on mushrooms and I saw it. I'm not going to go around saying that Elvis or rail, but I'll tell you, when I was laying on that lawn chair at the spa with Elf swimming through my body and making fun of my thoughts, it seemed very real. And it didn't seem fun at all. It was an unfunded, terrifying experience. And, um, if I'd lived 200 years ago and had just been forging for food and happened to eat some food and that had that experience, I would go back to the village and say, they're Elvis in the woods there. Elves, they swim through your body. They make fun of your thoughts. They're magic. They're magic. They, and so I think that, uh, psychedelics are a component, uh, in the sick and the experiences that people have of this nature.

Speaker 3:          00:49:15       But I don't think that that means that the experience that, I don't think that invalidates the experience. Well, it's also brings into account the fact that the brain itself produces psychedelic chemicals. Yes. Without any help whatsoever. The brain produces dimethyltryptamine five methoxy, dimethyltryptamine, dopamine, serotonin. There's a lot of shit going on in that brain. Melatonin, your brain is producing all of these chemicals and they come out and varying amounts, just like we have varying dick sizes and some people have shitty I side and this guy was born with a bad liver. Guess what? Some people also get indogenous dumps of psychedelic chemicals they can't control. And so they start seeing things. Yes, and this is something that's very difficult to measure. They've just recently figured out how to measure the pineal gland of rats to prove that the pineal gland itself is a source of dimethyltryptamine.

Speaker 3:          00:50:05       Until really recently it was just a theory. So now they know that for sure, but the way they had to do, they had to cut open the head of a live rat. You know, you're not going to let up. No one's going to let a person do that to them. So we're not even going to find out what what's going on inside a person's head. As far as the consultant, the production of this stuff. And we certainly are not gonna be able to figure out when it's active and when it's not. These big rushes in bursts. Unless we get more

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       advanced medical equipment or unless we can get right to the source of it, cut open someone's brain while they're in the middle of an activity, neither one of those events is very likely. So you're not going to be able to tell whether or not someone who had this crazy experience just had this rush of naturally produce psychedelic chemicals that we know exist in the brain.

Speaker 5:          00:50:48       That's it. Exactly, man. And maybe when they have that rush, they're actually perceiving something that is there and some form something that exists in the same way radio waves exist in the same way that ultraviolet rays exist. And we'll never know that until we stop the prohibition on psychedelics and start studying them again. But that's probably never going to happen.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       Um, the experience was still fun. You know, I enjoy going to rural places and the scenery there was beautiful and uh, Mike had all those pieces of petrified wood that he had found in that area. Apparently. He said, it's all over the place. You just find petrified wood and it's really, really super common. It's just a very, it's a very strange place. Like it's a, it's very beautiful. And they said there's a lot of cougars out there. They see like not the chicks that are looking for actions are over 40 is not. That's not what they meant. They meant like mountain lions, a lot of mount line activity and one of the women, the, what's her name that took us up there? Shannon. Shannon, right. That woman Shannon, while we were walking up to the top of that bluff, she told me she heard a cat.

Speaker 1:          00:52:01       Yes. She said she just didn't want to upset us. I go, how do you know that you heard one? She goes, you can tell what they sound like. She goes, but they didn't want to have anything to do with us, so I just didn't want to alarm y'all. Hmm. I was like, Jesus Christ, we're heard a mountain line like right next to us in the bushes. And she's like, no. Where I keep it moving, keep it moving. It's only nighttime when they hunt. You guys have to be careful with this show, man. Yeah. You're telling me man, got up and when I send you to the weird spots, yeah, it's bad. It's dangerous. Look, we're up in Cougar country who is guiding us captain crazy phase.

Speaker 5:          00:52:37       Yeah. Were guided through herds of cougars by a lunatic. This is afraid of,

Speaker 1:          00:52:45       what was the bulletproof Wolf Wrangler? The orb color. You know the horse whisperer. He's the Sasquatch whisper. Either Sasquatch was Burke. It's, I think it's, uh, if only founding bigfoot knew about this guy. You know, if we knew about this guy and when we were looking for big foot, we would've saved a lot of time. Yup. To me, the guy's just a magnet for the stuff. Bring him out there, hanging from a tree, like bait. But when we're around man, even, you know, even though he's a magnet for paranormal activity, when we're around, we just were such losers that we just jinxed it for him. Well, that's what he thinks. That's what he thinks probably. Yeah. I wonder if he some stuff while we were all out there together, but he didn't want to bring it up unless we brought her up cause he wasn't sure if it was real. Do you guys see my grandmother? No. Good. Just checking. Yeah, I didn't really, that's not Abraham Lincoln. They're telling me that I should blow up the federal building. Abraham Lincoln dressed up like the silver surfer with a swim cap on the, uh, the area was beautiful though. You know, it's the, uh, the ranch itself when we were overlooking the ranch. Gorgeous. I would love to have a ranch like that. It looks so bad ass, you know that a ranch house and beautiful trees and the beautiful field.

Speaker 4:          00:54:02       I think that's the real gift that hunting for the paranormal gives you is it gets you out in the nature. Yeah. It's one beautiful thing about it, man. This thing takes recluses out of their basement and endo nature to you go going for ghosts. That one sex. Yeah, indoor goes tiny, but still at least you're driving to other houses and a lot of people go to cemeteries and go outside to look for ghosts. This is nice man, because people who otherwise would just be sitting and moldering piles of old diapers, spraying d odor in the air to cover the stench of rotting cat that died three weeks ago, or they stare in the Internet conspiracy theory websites. This gets them out into nature and I think that's a beautiful thing about it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       It is, and you know what? In normally in nature, just wandering around, they'd probably start getting depressed. It pros nothing. What am I doing with my life? But when you're running for your life inside of a graveyard, because you know a ghost is chasing you, it makes things way more interesting and way more engineers you a spark of excitement. You in fact live the exact same life. Even if you imagined that this would be happening if you pretended that this would be happening and convinced yourself, you would live the exact same life as if an actual ghost was really chasing you. So you're goofy, shitty brain decides this, throw some chemicals down the hatch it. Listen, this guy's barely hanging on, let's reward and what a little of the good stuff. So they opens up some valve in your brain and psychedelic chemicals flow and you know all the sudden your shitty life that you're like barely hanging on and really thinking hard about jumping in front of a train. Yeah. All of a sudden it's transformed and like you are the one who's been haunted by Richard the eighth from another dimension. He comes out of the ground with a fucking Turkey leg in his hand. He was chasing you around the,

Speaker 4:          00:55:56       hey, it's gray. Why not? It's better than his real life is real life sucks. The fat one. Yeah man. Well, I mean, right. This is the eternal problem is do we embrace the fantasma on the invisible to make our white, our lives glow with the light of lies or do we just deal with the fact that we exist in an end, permanent part of the time space continuum and in a matter of a few

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       cosmic blinks are atoms are going to go spraying a part into infinity and we're going to be worm food. That's a hard thing for a lot of people to digest. So maybe they create these mythologies to come for them a little bit. But all that being said, I think that there's some people who may be actually have contact with this stuff just because crazy people believe it doesn't mean it's not real. It's like that old saying just because what does, how does it go? Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean people aren't following you. Well just cause you're crazy. It doesn't mean that there's no big foot out there. It's true. So we can't just say because the sources of all seem to have a burnt antenna, it doesn't necessarily mean that the phenomena doesn't exist. Let me ask you this. Have you experienced any blow back for your willingness to engage in any of these ideas, whether it's Ufo shows or big foot or anything spectacular like that? And I think paranormal and anything out of the realm of normal everyday life. Have you experienced any blow back blowback? Yeah. Is there any people like people like judging you for being a Wacko conspiracy theorist and talking about Harper, Kevin trails? Not at all. Everybody thinks I'm a very rational, logical person. I think a lot of people think I'm a scientist. I actually nominated for a Nobel prize. I believe my research is bulletproof.

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       No, I mean I honestly, I have not gotten very much condescension because I hang out with you. I mean, look man, I don't get a lot of that judgment, but um, I think actually it's the other way around. I think you tend to get more judgment from people when you're a skeptic than you do if you're a believer. I think skeptics take a lot of heat, man. You know, I took more heat from the chem trail episode than anything else I've ever done on Twitter. More people were upset at me because they believe that I'm like contributing to Geo engineering by the elites at the global elites are mixing aluminum in the jet fuel and using it to control the population like Ooh, that it's actually Nano particles in the chem trails that they're heating up with harp and they using that to control the population.

Speaker 3:          00:58:42       Like Golly, a certain point in time you just go, wow, what am I doing? Even communicating with you fuck heads. Well, I love the idea of following that all the way through. So this is what I like to imagine as the meeting where you're in an underground laboratory surrounded by federal agents are like, listen Joe, I think that they're catching on that we're spraying aluminum into their playgrounds. You're a charismatic guy. Can you do this? Show calm everything down a little bit. What do you want an island? We'll give you an island, a mortal life, and by the way, look, I can turn into a lizard and they send you back into the world to do a show in the Psi Phi network.

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       That's their answer to, to the

Speaker 1:          00:59:23       problem. Yeah. That's how you can show the problem. You get dirty comedians who also double as cage fighting commentators and you have them disseminate the information because everybody knows they are so reliable, accurate with their, their view of the world. Well, it's not like he's fucked up at all. Well, it's no, it's not like the guy's a marijuana advocate. Hey listen, we need to convince these conspiracy theorists that there is an actually Kim trails gimme that guy with a DMT molecule tattooed on his arm and the other guy has got that youtube video of him projectile vomiting.

Speaker 1:          00:59:56       Yeah, man, it's a grand conspiracy. You figured this out, Dick. Fuck 79 on Twitter. He's silly bitch. Yeah, there's, there's no getting around the fact that because of the Internet you get to communicate with a lot of people that you wouldn't ordinarily, there's people that you would gravitate towards and you find them as well, but there's also people that somehow or another show up at the party and you're like, Oh God, what is this? And you're going to have to deal with that. That's part of the whole openness of the complete experience of the Internet is that you are going to have to deal with that part of the part of the pro

Speaker 4:          01:00:32       blow harder, the fun man and, but I again, that's why I think that you have to hold people with extraordinary claims even more to the fire of logic and truth than other people because it's because you've got it. I really believe that there is a, for lack of a better word, a supernatural realm. There is something outside human perception that is populated that is possibly populated with a sentient beings that aren't embodied. I think that that's possible. It's been reported in every religion, every mythology. It's a story that keeps coming up again and again and again.

Speaker 1:          01:01:13       Everything. Your own personal experiences. Yes. So having had these personal experiences, it's something that you, you, you not only except it yourself, but you feel compelled to tell other people about it.

Speaker 4:          01:01:27       Yes, and the history of humanity is one where humans are being led by an invisible being. The world religions have controlled society for a long, long time. And these world religions all have at their root outside of Buddhism, the notion of an invisible entity that as an interest in guiding humans. And so this is not just some imaginary thing in the sense that, uh, that it's something that people talk about who also huff glue. This is something that's been controlling the flow of history for thousands of years. So I think that it's very important to try to get to the truth of it. What's the core? Is it just the brain? Is the brain just some drug dealer or our brains? Just a grateful dead parking lot that from time to time spray hallucinogenics into us. The back of the bus explodes and acid flies through the air like confetti and everybody just sticks her tongue out. Yeah. Is that what it is or is in, is that all it is? Is it just that the neurons in our brain misfire a little bit like a, like a electrical cable in a puddle and it causes it to see these entities? Or is there another universe that exists that we can see if we learn to control our minds and our consciousness and I think it's important to explore those ideas.

Speaker 1:          01:02:50       I think also that our life in this dimension of conscious reality is filled with so much uncertainty and so much confusion and we have such a inclination to follow others, to follow smarter people than us to follow the leader too because we're all basically terrified of what we're doing. We're all going through life be barely hanging on because you don't really want to think about the entirety of it all because it's too much. I just got to get to the work by x time and you know, I punch out at six and then I'm going to go do this. Like that's, that's filling your time and it's not by any small coincidence that that's filling your time. It's because if the, if it wasn't, if you really were spending all of your time contemplating your existence, it would almost be overwhelming. It would almost be too much for you to wrap your head around.

Speaker 1:          01:03:44       And because of that, we seek to defined our universe in very certain terms. This is real. That's nonsense. This, this is would, you know, there's no elves in space around me. You don't know what you're talking. And we were like adamant about our, our version of reality to the point where people get upset at you if you want to escape this version of reality. Oh, you looking for a way out. Are you scared? A reality? You can't handle reality. You've got to take drugs. Like people will say that to me and what are they trying to do? They're terrified of other people escaping reality too. They're terrified of reality. They're terrified of different definitions that they have could have to consider of reality. Everyone is, it's not something we address, but it is subconscious. It is there all the time. Yup. Yup.

Speaker 4:          01:04:32       It's true, man. And, and I, and I think that the impulse behind skeptics is of, is a, is a great impulse. It's an impulse that changes the world for the better. When I don't, I don't know who, uh, was the first person to say that there are diseases were called caused by germs. I wish I did. But, um, if that person who started figuring out that, oh, I think there's invisible entities that crawl into our body and make us sick. If that person hadn't explored that in a scientific way, then who knows what could have happened to humanity. You know, we all the, all the different cures and antibiotics that we have, that wouldn't have happened. I mean eventually it would have happened. But if somebody, you had that initial impulse, I think there's invisible creatures that get as sick when they started saying that everyone around them where they thought they, they were insane.

Speaker 4:          01:05:25       You know, the story of the, um, uh, I can't remember the name as a doctor who ended up in an insane asylum, but cause he started suggesting that doctors wash their hands before they deliver babies. He would say if you're touching a corpse, wash your hands and then deliver the baby. And doctors at the time said, gentlemen, have no need to wash their hands because they didn't know that there was viruses and bacteria, uh, existing in the world because it hadn't been proven. So this guy who came up with this idea that doctors or wash their hands, he ended up in a mental asylum. He went crazy because he knew this was real. He went insane because he knew that there was something called germs and nobody believed in it at the time. So that's the, that's the great problem. All the people out there bugling about Ufos, bugling about, uh, wormholes and big foot and missed wolf's. They have to let skeptics interrogate them in the most intense way, not to disprove them or show that they're crazy, but to get to the core truth.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       And sometimes the core truth is just theirs. They're the only one who were really have access to it. And if it was some sort of a hallucination or whether it was real to them, but we can't perceive it because we weren't tuned into whatever frequency and radio dial of the universe that they were at the time that it happened. The bottom line is you got to bring something back in order for me to take it totally seriously. I'm listening. I'll listen. I'll try to put myself in your footsteps. I'll try to put my myself in your head and try to figure out what you possibly could have been experiencing, why it was all going down, but unless it's happening to me, it's all just nonsense. You know, and that's, that's a a real part of the reality that these folks are experiencing and it should be.

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       It has to be, you know, less. I can experience it myself. There's nothing that I've seen that compels me to believe anybody. This is nothing I've seen that compels me that this is an actual UFO landing side, that this is a guy who's been a board of space ship, that this is someone who's been abducted. Apparently there's some people that tell me that they're going to tell me the story of what happened to them and I'm going to believe it. And you're going to meet one of them. You're going to meet this woman named Nicole Dome and you're going to sit down with her. And she apparently has some sort of an alien implant that she claims she got inside of her body. I don't know the full story, but a, you're going to learn it and uh, I figured it'd be perfect for you. That's your type of person.

Speaker 1:          01:08:00       Yeah. This sounds like an eharmony date for me. Freaky tattooed up. Very pretty girl who's been abducted by aliens. It's my cell mate. That's it. You're on your other path is exciting. I've never met a person that has been abducted by aliens. I'm at a couple of people that told me they were abducted by aliens, but I'm pretty sure they were bullshitting. Like I've never met one person who had a story that I was like, wow, that this, this um, this seems to be real. Um, but I'm told that, uh, there's a woman, her name is Nicole and you're gonna meet her. And this woman apparently has an incredibly believable, compelling story. And people that have talked to her have said, you know, wow. Like you walk away from it and you go, I believe her. I don't know. And I, but I trust your judgment and uh, it's, she's right up your alley. She's really hot. Freaky look in covered in tattoos and uh, she's been a borders Ufo. So mean. This is my soulmate. Your soulmate. That's amazing. So go meet her and talk to her and you know, tell us what's up.

Speaker 5:          01:09:09       I'm there. E harmony date. Okay. Tell me about Nicole dome. Wow, you're right. She's a beautiful woman. Uh, tattoos, interesting tattoos. Um, she seemed very grounded, focused. Uh, she did not seem anything like captain crazy cake from, what did you call him? Captain crazy phase. He, she sees, she didn't seem anything like captain crazy face. She was very focused, calm, open. She definitely experienced something. Okay. What was her story? She's leaving a diner with her friend. They want to go play pool. It's late at night. This is a small town. She's driving down the road and suddenly they witnessed this hexagon, a light above the car. And so she, they decided to pull over to look at the light because they're experiencing a Ufo and suddenly she's driving down the road. Yeah. And she's a mile down the road and, uh, she gets to meet her friends at the pool hall and they're pissed off because she's an hour late and she should have been there in four minutes after leaving the cafe.

Speaker 5:          01:10:23       So she had the type of, uh, the, what do they call that? The tip not aggression sheet now. And I am not a progression. She had at time loss, she had time loss. Uh, and she and her friends seemed drugged after the experience. So that's, that's her experience. Her friends seemed drugs. Yes. When they were driving down the road after having decided to stop to look at this light, there are further down the road with no memory of what's happened. They have the typical form of Amnesia that abductees talk about. Her friends seems like she's drugged. Her friends seem like she's been anesthetized or given some kind of drug to knock her out. They both, she's our friends groggy. I asked if they, if a friend was drunk or did they were high? She said No. And where were they coming from? They were from a diner.

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       Is it possible that someone dosed them in the diner? Absolutely. Absolutely. Right. It is possible that they were seen as much more likely someone was being an asshole who's a working in the kitchen, decide to slip some LSD into their cheerio's or whatever the hell they ate,

Speaker 5:          01:11:27       haven't seen as much more likely. Well, she, yes, definitely. That's a possibility. Now, uh, her story is not that she ended up in somebody's basement tied to a chair on Cheerio laden LSD or Lsd Laden cheerio's she, her story is that, um, psychics started telling her that something on the left side of her body was off. And this happened a couple of times. Uh, and so she went to a UFO convention. And Are you looking at me like,

Speaker 1:          01:12:07       well, because here's, here's my feeling. You know how I feel about psych techs and I think you know how I feel about people that find out something really special happened to them. All those things are very suspect. The psychic thing is incredibly suspect to also, a lot of people are very susceptible to suggestion and a lot of people are very susceptible to attractive girls with tattoos. That's, you know. Yeah, so I knew you were going to have a problem with reality here, whereas if she was a fat guy with three teeth and she smelled like Heineken, you, you'd feel like this guy's an asshole. He wasn't a border Ufo. He's trying to get me to look at it. Stomach man. It was gross. He kept lifting up his beer gut asking me if I had a black light and I'm like, this guy's going to try to fuck me. I got gotta. Get out of here. That's what you would've said. You were hypnotized by the sweet nectar of youth and the reckless indignation of a girl with tattoos on her tits. That's what happened with you. You got caught up in the the tsunami. That is the sexuality of that woman. And you were willing to loan,

Speaker 6:          01:13:14       Oh yeah, you want to Skype, I can see your implants. I mean, you know the alien one,

Speaker 1:          01:13:32       right? It's natural. It's natural. That's why you know, I mean it's empire for some people it's very know

Speaker 5:          01:13:40       I'm not gonna argue with you the, the vehicle telling the UFO story. If it is a, if it happens to be a beautiful young, tattooed girl, then yes. I, you know what, my ears are going to perk up a little bit more. But I will say that I've run into a lot of pretty tattoo girls who seem bat shit crazy. They seem like they've been staring at the sun, isn't it? And Glue who, you know, it's just cause you're right. So I will say that and you can

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       review the tape. I will say that she seemed very centered, focused her, she believed her story. And um, the most compelling evidence that she has is that apparently there is a scar on her stomach and that if you put a black light over, you can see it. It wasn't there when she showed it to us at the bar. The problem issues getting this information from a psychic. The problem is she's getting this information, not just from a sidekick, but someone who says they're a psychic and almost everyone who says they're a psychic is full of shit. It might be 100% of them, but it's at least 90 dine. Okay. So the odds of her finding the one out of a hundred that isn't full of shit, those odds really suck. So then you have a person who is a nice person, but a person willing to get tattoos on their tits.

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       Okay, she's gay, she's gangster. She's willing to take some chances. Look, I have tattoos myself. She's willing to take some chances. Okay. She's wild. She's willing to go with it. She's willing to go with it. Yeah, we'll want to go with an idea and she might be willing to go with a memory that's some crazy fucking fake psychic plants in her brain. And it sounds real. And when you convince yourself a shit like that, if you're so inclined, especially, and I believe she probably is so inclined to believe the fantastic common for people who have UFO abduction experiences to have like an inclination towards that type of thing. They believe in that type of thing, which aids the experience confirmation bias and she's only talking about memories. That's right. Well here's the provable part. She has going, apparently these beings abducted or the memories that she has are of being put on a steel table and they did something to our ovaries, possibly put an implant inside of her.

Speaker 3:          01:16:01       She's actually going to get tests within the next few days to see what's going on down there and to see if there is some kind of implant there and also it's an Iud. She forgot about, she had an IUD put in when she was in high school and it's just, Oh fuck. Where'd that thing go? I look, I hear is that she has no, she has no evidence right now to prove. Of course it doesn't have any evidence, but she's going to get it and she's not going to happen. She's not going to happen. How about that? How about hold your breath.

Speaker 3:          01:16:35       It's never going to appear. There's going to be no evidence. It doesn't exist. You're never going to find it. It lives inside the imagination only. I'm going to scan her with a blacklight. It might be a real experience now. Okay. As far as memories go, her memory might be as real as my memories of some stuff I did just a couple of weeks ago, which are very shady at best. If you asked me about my trip to the mall to get my laptop fixed two weeks ago and I had to recount everything that happened. If you could see inside my memory about how shitty it really is and little, I really remember about my trip to the mall. I remember almost nothing. If you told me I had to pick out where I was parked or there was, I couldn't drive home and black shit. I Dunno where I parked.

Speaker 3:          01:17:18       I have no idea where I parked at the mall two weeks ago and that was me and that was real while I was awake. So these memories of this woman has that are pulled out of a dream state. Okay. Pulls out of a hypnotic state. Suggested to her by a psychic. Don't they don't even live in her conscious memory. A memory that she's piecing together from something that someone told her about some dreams maybe. Yeah, that might as well me and my trip to the mall. Okay. Cause so it to her it is real. So when she's telling you that it's real, she does feel it's real. And when she looks down, first of all, why is this freak looking at herself with black lights? Well that's, this lever looks at themselves with a black light. He was at a UFO convention. Naked. No liquor.

Speaker 3:          01:18:02       Your belly button. No, this is the story for Real UFO convention, which shows up under black light loads. They do, they show up like ghosts. This is a cut. They take you to take your little woman and have a little party on her upper mid section and then then flash if a black light close the shut the lights off, close the shades, use a black light. You like, oh, now I get it. Yeah, that's a scar, honey. She got caught with a gun shot of load. That's what it is. She got caught in the crossfire and some of it was still stuck on her side. Can you please not talk about Nicole? I'm sorry. It wasn't even really Nicole. I'd never met her. She said to me, she's an imaginary person, but I need to tell you where the black light thing happened because then you can really start making fun of her.

Speaker 3:          01:18:46       Okay. The how, so how did she find out about this car? She found out about the scar at a UFO convention. She said that there was a booth where someone had written in black sharpie scans for alien implants and you go into the booth and they make you take your clothes off and they run a blacklight over your body and they tell you, they tell you if you have an implant and life is beautiful. It's really beautiful. Life is a beautiful thing because it's a play. It's, it's, it's, we're watching it all play out. It's really a grand piece of artwork that's constructed for our amusement. There's no other way. There's no other way that could be real. There's no other way that someone could have a booth at a Ufo conference where you have to take your clothes off and they'd look at you with a black light, which oh, just so happens to show loads all the loads on you, all the loads on you glow like one of those panther paintings that you had in high school. I remember those black light posters that you had. The panther had like yellow teeth and claws and yellow eyes and little little red with his mouth. Maybe truck dealer had won. Those were the shit. That's what they're looking for.

Speaker 3:          01:20:05       The idea is so

Speaker 1:          01:20:07       that that's how she found out about this, that it really feels like we're in the middle of a Coen brothers movie. This, this is that. This is a real person and this is really happening in today in 2013 in the modern era of smartphones pressing Google, asking it where to go. It gives you directions in this world. Someone finds themselves naked with a black light going over their body, while some white guy with dreadlocks is telling them about scars that they got because they were picked up by aliens. She said, the guy worked at NASA. I'm Fuzzy Dick. He's a cleanup guy, cleans up the spoon. He said, NASA cleanup booth guy. They have a devotee of peep booth at NASA. It's very well it's, you know, a lot of those astronauts is through a very stressful job. They need to unwind. They like peep booths. This guy, he's the official mopper well shows live with a black light at parties. He keeps everything rocking. This fucking guy's got his own black light. Jesus Christ. Glow sticks to the dickhead. I agree, man. It's what you believe. This woman, I believe this is the part that's going to get on TV.

Speaker 1:          01:21:25       See, these are real podcasts now you know your Fox, okay? I believe that she experienced some believe that she's hot and hypnotic. Let's start with that. She's hot. She's hypnotic in you and I both know that you've always had a thing for tattooed up girls, especially girls with good work. Let's be honest, who doesn't? That's a dangerous woman, willing to take chances, and if you're a standup comedians, that's the type of person you need in your life. Right. Okay. Okay. That's all. She's gangster. Yes. Okay, so you liked that, right? Yeah, me too. All right, go ahead. So you're infatuated. You're intoxicated. This beautiful woman, God, you're so close to it. You could smell her and she's showing you her little scars.

Speaker 6:          01:22:02       Oh, wow. Yeah, I can totally see it. Yeah. You get a black light and you know we can look cool. Next thing you know, she's wearing your fedora. You're both naked. You still got your socks off, black lights going back and forth in a dressing room somewhere.

Speaker 1:          01:22:29       Yes. Yeah, easily. Man, I can see it. Okay. You're not really going to give me an accurate assessment of what really went down. I wouldn't. I need to be there with you. I need to be there with you to watch your chemical makeup, to watch your body shift like a giant human mood ring. All of a sudden you just green with horniness as you're glowing, like the whole, if you were a mood ring, it would start cracking at the seams, would be able to take the g force of green. It's pumping into the size of this poor fucking mood ring. Here's the thing, like a big

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       aquarium trying to hold in sharks explodes and takes your finger off with it just because, okay, so just cause a pretty girl is talking about aliens doesn't mean that a person showing you were skin lifting up her clothes. She's going like this. Sorry. Sorry. That's about seven inches from my been saying. If you went from my pussy up with your fingers, you would, it'd be like seven inches. Look man, all of what you're saying is accurate. It's not. It doesn't mean she wasn't abducted. Exactly. Exactly. It's like you said earlier, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean enough following. Yes. Just cause you're a beautiful, tattooed girl with an invisible scar doesn't mean that you didn't get abducted by aliens. Just because you're a crazy liar. It doesn't mean you haven't really been a board of Ufo. That's right. That's right. That's exactly right. So, you know, that's why I'm looking forward to getting the results of her tasks. You guys going to stay in touch?

Speaker 3:          01:24:12       Can I send her an email? You're not going to believe this is the bid. They just came out with a new type of black light that works best on naked girls. It's amazing. I, I'm an Amazon prime member and it's uh, it's already here. It's here. Like you could come over and try it if you want. I mean, I'm totally cool with it. Oh, it is dark out. She has a boyfriend. Okay. Just these are just jokes folks. We don't mean anything. We're saying not at all. Okay. But what I am saying is that I'm not entirely sure that you were the hard nose private. I would have liked on the case.

Speaker 3:          01:24:48       No Way, man. No Way. You're not going to get an ambush me. And that's a course. Not of course not God, man. Hey Man. Even if it was a charismatic man, okay. I have often wondered if Tom Cruise is trying to convince me of something. I've seen Tom Cruise give interviews. He's incredibly convincing. Okay. I've seen Tom cruise argue with people about stuff you don't want to be in an argument with Tom Cruise now and if Tom Cruise is telling you about his UFO abduction, you might, you might be inclined to believe it, man might be inclined to believe it. He might be so charismatic that he can just hit every note exactly the right way with the right amount of pause, the right amount of sincere emotional content. You know, man, I have no proof of this. And I'd say if this goes on the show, you're all getting a huge lawsuit. But I heard that Tom Cruise pays guys to come into his gym when he's working on rape him.

Speaker 3:          01:25:42       Let's edit that out. Um, okay. All right. We wrapped up Nicole dumb start with, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So what were your impressions of Nicole? She was a very focused and you go to start by that time, there's more. Yeah. For more information about this much for this conversation, you're not going to get all of it. Okay. Sorry. It's [inaudible] dot com they're not gonna, they're not gonna show all this shit. But for more information, go to [inaudible] dot com we have a lot more of this up there. We had to edit this. It's a 44 minute shelf up. Um, okay. And then can it be said

Speaker 2:          01:26:31       what?

Speaker 3:          01:26:33       It's all right to say it. The camera again. I think that's fine. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It doesn't matter what, that might be funny as like as each other, what would happen if you got abducted, but you got to each of you and that was okay. We're good. Um, what do you think would happen? We good. We good? Yep.

Speaker 2:          01:26:52       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:26:53       Have you ever saw it about what you would do if you were abducted? What do you think would happen? I'd cry and scream and try to keep whatever I could out of my asshole. Would you or would you worry that if you didn't give up they would just paralyze you and, and do horrible things to you? Maybe, maybe even kill you? Yeah, I mean, I think that that is what happens is they end up paralyzing you. Do you think that people have ever been killed by you? LFOS

Speaker 3:          01:27:30       yeah, I don't think so. I don't know man. I mean it killed by you, fos. No, no. I don't think people, men killed by your foes, but plenty of people say that they've gotten sucked up onto these ships and some people think that it's, you have, as some people say, it could just be government agents. By the way, if you're a, here's the thing, if you're an inventor, but you're also a Perv, all you have to do is have a levitating craft that can suck people into that. They're totally cool with getting caught as we still ahead of the curve though. And the fun that thing, you'd have to sell it. You'd have to sell them to fund it and then it would go public and then it would get out and then people would be careful. They would wear special tinfoil hats, doesn't allow them to get sucked into your giant rape ship.

Speaker 3:          01:28:10       People talk about it. If you get sucked up into a UFO and you get probed, as they call it, people talk about it. No, he went to essentially violating experience taken into some guy's trailer. Like if that happened to you or you're just walking down the street and somehow you got hypnotized by like a spiral in a trailer park and you ended up getting like probed by some redneck dude wanted to shove his water bong inside of you, you wouldn't talk about that. That's not a story you share. But somehow if you get taken up into a silver trailer in space and get probed by a thing, it's like, hey, I got probed. Well it's always a medical experiment was never sexual in nature. Never left purposely. So aliens are creeps. So if you were abducted, but are they whose creepier and the alien

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       or the zookeeper? The alien. Why? Because they do it to people. How about the guy who works at seaworld tells dolphins they have to flip or they don't get fish who's creepier? I'd say the aliens are less creepy cause they seem to leave us in the wild. They don't seem to keep us. They don't seem to be like kidnapping people left and right and sucking them up in a giant space. Zoos, I say the aliens are less creepy than the zookeeper. Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:29:26       Let me ask you this. If I told you that I drew, drove around in my car and from time to time picked up stray dogs and shoved my fingers,

Speaker 1:          01:29:34       they're assholes and then put them back out in the street. What'd you think? I was creepy. I look, I love you man. So I'm not the best person to judge. I'd forgive you. I say he's probably shouldn't do that, man. It's probably bad Karma, but it's not like I would rat you out for something like that. Friends Dude. But I think that, I mean, I don't know that, like I said, I don't know anyone who, I legitimately believe their alien abduction experience, so I don't know what's happening. I don't know if it is just in fact a memory that someone has introduced into their mind and they relay it as if it was a fact, but much like my real memories, they're very sketchy. I've had some beautiful moments in my life and I look back on them and there's duff flashes and trying to try to piece it together, you know, try to piece together some of the most memorable spec tack rule events, spectacular events in your life. And they still, they come off like weird slideshows of blurry images and a narrative that you can follow in your head because you know it cause you remember it. And also because you've said it a bunch of times, you told people about the experience, but the reality of your memories, there's terrible. So it's, it's so hard to say what exactly is going on.

Speaker 4:          01:30:51       Well, you know what those gray aliens look like, right? They look like, and I think someone else has posited this theory, but if you look at the gray aliens and you take a doctor with, um, with a, um, medical mask on and you look at him delivering a baby, the first thing a lot of people see is this, that kind of shape, that kind of thing. And when you're taken out of the womb and suddenly they're running medical tests on you, which is what happens when you're born. They weigh you, they do all this weird shit to you. I don't know exactly what then that is a very traumatic experience and some people say that alien of dod teas are actually reliving the trauma of birth. That's what they're experiencing is the trauma of being yanked out of a very warm, safe place and being poked and prodded by beings that you can't possibly understand because you've never seen another human being in your life.

Speaker 1:          01:31:41       Totally makes sense. And then also it sort of makes sense why there's such a clinical nature to all these experiences and it's always these cold tables and it pokes and no one's talking. You know, one's loving and warm and comforting. It's always just medical and cold and sanitary and and very dark and bleak. And the room seems impossibly large and bright. Yes, that's exactly what it is. It's probably just an implanted memory that's distorted radically over the years and added to with dreams and all sorts of other paranoia's that you, you gather up and stew together over the course of a lifetime and then while you're sleeping and they all come boiling together, taking me away. Meanwhile, you're just a baby. Yeah. You're just a little baby shitting all over yourself screaming for the first time, staring at a fluorescent life. When you've been inside of a pussy for the last nine months, you don't have a fucking clue as to what you're seeing now.

Speaker 1:          01:32:40       You, how would you not remember that? There was a big question, but why would we assume that kids don't remember that? Some people say he tried to block it out of your memory because it's so traumatic. Horrible thing. Especially if you get circumcised spraying out of that thing and they snipped the tip of your cock off. Exactly. Exactly. And how about if it's done in north docs, Jewish way where the oil has to suck on it stuff. The bleeding. I tried to forget it. Yeah, the hell are you gonna remember that. You don't want to, I don't even want to think about it happening to other people. Well, you answered my question for me about how I feel about being abducted. I was going to turn the same question to myself. What would you do exactly? Try to stop something from going to my, but that's it. It's what you do switch to do because it probably doesn't really happen. You know what? I don't think it really happens and if it does really happen, I don't think it happens physically. I might be wrong, I might be wrong, but I don't think it happens.

Speaker 1:          01:33:36       Just not enough. No, no videos. It's not a single like security video of a guy like leaving his body and flying through the walls and aliens come and taking them away and the wife Getting Up to pee in the middle of the night and the husband's gone. She calls nine one one and 10 minutes later he just appears magically underneath the covers. There's no, there's none of that roof. There's no video. There's no nothing because a bunch of weird people. They're telling weird stories and that's all you get. And that's all you're going to get bank on it. Put it all in the bank. Bet It all on black. You don't have a fucking chance. No one's pulling anything back. No one's going to get a picture. No one's going to have an implant that's worth a shit. No one's going to have a single photograph that doesn't look like bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:34:19       No one, there'll be nothing. There'll be no evidence until there is, there'll be no evidence. I think that we never get to that point. How about that? I think human beings get lodged into a simulation long before we ever figured out how to really live this planet and I think that probably happens exactly the same all throughout the universe. I bet the only space travel that people do is inside of simulations. I bet no one ever gets past it or that this is what life does. Life creates an artificial reality. As soon as it knows how to and jumps in there, they create an artificial version of what they would like when they figured out that the the human synapse, is it just a bunch of ones and zeros and boil it down and copy

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       it and duplicate it. I think they just, that's what we do. No one ever gets anywhere. It's a, well, I mean it's so much more economical too, and it just, it is, I mean, it's easier to go into the depths of your mind than it is to build some kind of ship and go flying to a dead planet. Look at dirt. Look, I could be wrong, but I don't think anybody ever goes anywhere. I could be wrong, but I don't think any of these abductors I've ever left their bed. I don't think that anybody that's telling you these stories has ever really experienced anything in a physical sense. It doesn't mean it didn't really happen, but I think that if you could put a camera over them while they slept and when they woke up in the morning with this fantastic story, but you wouldn't see nothing.

Speaker 3:          01:35:36       I'm afraid that you may be right. It could just be a subjective experience. It could be some kind of traumatic memory. It could be a lot of things that are in the subconscious mind, but one thing's for certain. A lot of people have had this experience now why they're having it, who knows? But yeah, you would think with the number of people are having this experience, you drive down the road and look to the side and see people getting sucked up into the sky and clouds coming back down confused and people have things, they have seen things and you just don't know the stories. You know? You're sitting here all smug. But if it happened to you, man, imagine. Imagine if it happened to you and no one wants to believe your story and you're worried about telling people at work. They might think you're crazy and you lose your job and you can't feed your family.

Speaker 3:          01:36:21       Right? You can't Cay Brown because you're sitting here all smug. Must be nice. Must be nice to be a standup comedian living in Los Angeles. I'm in a trailer park in Oklahoma. Someone's suck me out of the sky and now I can't tell my boss the coal mine or I might lose my fucking kids. My wife's doing meth, my fucking tire's flat. I okay, you're kind of an asshole Dunkin. You know that old you talking a lot of shit about people that have actually had unique experiences. Sorry about don't know my life. Dunkin, you don't know what I have. What happened to me that night changed me forever. Yeah, I bet you're like the old worst. If they got take him. The aliens are when they have duct that guy, oh God. Or He's playing golf drunk in the middle of the night and they scoop him up, put him back loop.

Speaker 3:          01:37:12       You guys are dicks. Okay? If I was super fucking advanced, who wouldn't just be stealing people? Why they play golf, spit in their face and shit dealing with this guy. But that's that. You know, that is one thing man, that like, uh, what do you know? What if you could just like overpower the aliens like you get, you never hear about people getting abducted and then wrestling the aliens to the ground. These are apparently these frail little beings. What if you could fight them? I think that the idea is that they've reached this point where they control matter what their mind. That's why they have these giant heads that are way bigger than ours and that's why they don't seem to talk with their mouths. Yeah, look at me. I'm like adding to the folklore. I'm just making shit up. I don't know if any of this has ever happened ever,

Speaker 4:          01:37:56       but I'm like cool. Culminating a bunch of different idiot stories. Well they communicate with their mind. They do Dunkin, what they do. So basically in plant ideas in your brain, by the way, JPL, you mentioned gps. You know where that comes from, right? That's John Parsons Laboratory. You know John Parsons was right. John Parsons was it that the rifle man, John Parsons is the Devonian Allister car par salads. Parsons Parsons was a devotee of Alistair Crawley who that's his laboratory. So that Parsons, he believed in extra dimensional entities and he would say prayers before he did any of his tasks with rocket fuel and stuff. And, uh, l Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, stole his girlfriend because they used to hang out. You can look that stuff up. It's all 100% true. There's a crater on the moon named after him. Now, Alister Crawley, he wants, tried to summon the entity. This is way before people were talking about aliens and the drawing that he drew of the entity looks exactly like the gray aliens. You can look that up exactly like a gray alien. So follow that weird Mays.

Speaker 2:          01:39:01       Ooh,

Speaker 4:          01:39:03       maybe it's Jack Parsons. I can't remember which Parsons does the rabbit hole. Sun. That's the right at all. We're done. Anything else? We good?
