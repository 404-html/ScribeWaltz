Speaker 1:          00:00:00       And boom, we're live. Before you take any, uh, Dr Gordon's advice, I just want you to know folks. He's scared of shrimp, shellfish, pork. He's never had wild game and he refuses to eat outside of a very narrowed dietary discipline. He's got like a very. What is it? You really do? You really eat? I don't eat pork. You don't eat pork? No pork. That's. But you know about Bacon, right? When was the last time you've had it in Turkey? Bacon? A day? Yeah. I had Turkey Bacon. Absolutely. That's just pathetic. Turkey sausage. Turkey sex with two condoms on a totally unnecessary. Well, some of us don't even use that, but how could you eat Turkey bacon and not eat the real Bacon Bacon? I used to eat it, but after getting sick and no one got sick ever in the history of the world from Bacon. Do you eat bread? Yes. You have no problems with gluten? Well, I don't have a problem with gluten. Okay. There's a lot of people that do have a problem with gluten. Well, I have a problem with pig. You don't have any problems with pig. How sure are you? My school doesn't look as good as it does when I'm not on it. What are you doing? Go look over your stool with a fine tooth comb. Every morning. We're here. We're with

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       Dr. Mark Gordon, my good friend and his friend Andrew Marr, who is what, what is your position in the Warrior Angels Foundation? I found it, uh, Joe, uh, so, uh, founder and former Greenberg and tell us all about what it's about and what the mission is. Yeah, absolutely. Um, our mission is to get no cost, a traumatic brain injury treatment to veterans who need it, so it's an alternative means for to get guys treatment outside of the medical model, which is predicated on a medication and psychotherapy, which it does not improve quality of life. Is that changing at all because of, you know, all the work that Dr Gordon has been doing and there's been a lot of. I've heard outside of you even mention of your name, people bring up your therapies and things that you've been promoting for several years. Has, is that changing in the community at all? We're working to change it actively, so, uh, we're, we're going to have a meeting next month with some, uh, some top people and the active duty side of the house.

Speaker 2:          00:02:08       We're also meeting with our and, and works of getting with the Veterans Administration and working that. So we're going, they're going to know everything across the board about these protocols, why they work, why they're better, how they're cost efficient, how they're time efficient, how this can not only improve as soldier's life, but the life of the family child. Second order effects go on and on and on. So the evidence is out there, the science is behind it. This isn't false hope we're not offering any false hope. Everything is science, evidence based, uh, reporting that we're doing and based off Dr Gordon's clinical application of years and years of doing it. So the short answer is yes, they're hearing about it and we have a five year plan to overtake the system and have them implement these on both sides of the house. So to speak. Now, for people who haven't heard any of our podcasts before, haven't heard your discussion

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       about it. The one of the biggest issues that we're experiencing with soldiers coming back from Afghanistan and Iraq is if you hear my voice, I've got a little bit of a cold ladies and gentlemen, a traumatic brain injury elk a lot. How dare you, it's big bacon, Bacon, and a clam. Um, a lot of soldiers are coming back from these, these wars with injuries that may have been fatal in the past. They're no longer because of all these advancements in medical technology, but they're still still dealing with the ongoing effects of the war, the traumatic brain injury. Now, what you have found and many others have supported this, is that a lot of this is there's damage to the pituitary gland. It stops the production of hormones. This leads to deep depression and leads to some pretty significant issues that soldiers are facing. So if you could just fill people in on that.

Speaker 3:          00:03:53       Well, what we found is that, um, because of the body armor being so efficient, a lot of the blast damage, instead of killing someone is leaving them with trauma to the brain in any form of trauma to the brain, whether or not it's a blast trauma being hit on the head, slip and fall, a automobile accident, turning upside down or whatever the situation might be. A, the brain changes its chemistry because of inflammation and that's from tearing of little nerves. It's not only the pituitary and that's been some of the problem that we've had is focusing as I focus on narrow kind of diet, focusing in on just the pituitary, but what we found is a group of chemistry in the brain called neuro steroids, which regulate our personality in some of those neuro steroids have names like to stasia drone or dihydrotestosterone, estrogen, pregnenolone and the literature has been around since about 1986 showing that these regulate our brain function.

Speaker 3:          00:04:48       So head trauma of any sort can cause it to decrease number one. Number two, with any form of damage to the brain, you get inflammation and that inflammation expands. Let's say if there was a small area of tear in the brain or a bullet that penetrate a penetrating injury to the head, that area where the bullet or the foreign object a diminished amount of brain tissue, it grows larger because of inflammation. It destroys more and more neurons in the more cells in the brain that are called neurons are destroyed. The greater the onset of cognitive impairment, your ability to use your brain in a function and then emotionality changes.

Speaker 1:          00:05:28       No. How did you get involved in this and how did you figure out what so many people hadn't figured out what this the with the emphasis on therapy and pain medication, antidepressants. How did you see through that? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:05:39       Well, I really didn't discover anything. All I did was in reading the literature, as much as I read it, saw that people had already laid the pathway for me to follow and I've followed it intensely for the past 21 years doing endocrinology in the past 10 years doing specifically neuroendocrinology, which deals the brain and it's in my population of patients. I used to see them for hormone deficiency and then started going back asking them those were the hormone deficiency, if they've had any kind of head trauma in the first book that I wrote, which had the first introduction for me to write about traumatic brain injury and hormone deficiency was the young kid by the name Michael, who had been in a um, who had come to me. His parents brought him in and he had hormone deficiency and we correct it, is personality, improved his quality of life, improve, and then read an article which I've shared with you in the past which came out of a Turkey about pugilists who had the specific growth hormone deficiency.

Speaker 3:          00:06:34       And that was my epiphany article where I started looking further and further into literature and Moo, moo tie. They had a hormone deficiency and then boom, all the hormone deficiencies. So this kid, I went back to him and said, have you ever had any trauma of any kind? He said, well, when he was 17, he was 21 at the time when he was 17. He was in a motorcycle accident, was in a coma for three days, came out of the coma, and his neurologist said, oh, you'll be fine. He progressively got worse. So that set the stage for me to start looking at this relationship between any kind of head trauma. And then 2007. Uh, my first military was a green baret. I met the wife who was a emergency room doc in North Carolina and she called me and told me about her husband who was six towards the duty was having some problems.

Speaker 3:          00:07:27       We ran. We donated the money for him to get the full testing and turn out who's hormone deficient when we correct it is hormones. He was back in the good. A good light with the military was getting ready to get kicked out for insubordination. And that progressed on 2009, uh, with opening up our practice to military. And it just kept on repeating itself the same pattern, the same head trauma blast, a blast injury and hormone deficiency. And now, how's this being received? Like the rest of the medical community? Because, well, this is an uphill battle because the way it's being treated presently, um, if you look at the literature from 2012, 410,000 service servicemen came back as veterans and, um, were diagnosed with ptsd. Now a posttraumatic stress disorder is usually perceived as being a psychological psychologically precipitated event where they witnessed something that was horrifying to them, a death of a friend, loss of a limb or whatever the situation might have been to stimulate it.

Speaker 3:          00:08:32       And that immediately opened him up to simple treatment here, take this packet of antidepressants and you'll get better. Well, they didn't get better, so they didn't get better because they were having what's called treatment resistant depression, which now we find is due to hormonal deficiency. If you look at the civilian population, people with hormone to, with treatment resistant depression, you check them out and the testosterone deficient or estrogen overdose, or low progesterone or low pregnenolone, other chemicals that are in our brain. And, um, these individuals have been the, um, the foundation of what I do in trying to find a simple way to replenish them. What you have to do is test them and that's not being done. It's so much easier just to hand a packet and say you have ptsd when the majority of them are traumatic brain injury, and I was on Dr drew show with one of our patients who was a army corpsman and he didn't have a single scratch on his body, but within two years of leaving a separating from the service, he started developing depression, mood swings, explosive personality.

Speaker 3:          00:09:43       He ends up coming into our program and we find out he has two and a half hormone deficiencies and the pattern is indicative of having had head trauma. Well turned out he would walk behind Abramson tanks as they were just charging their shells and he said, man, my body would shut her, and he was around javelin missiles. He was around repetitive gunfire. He personally didn't have a scratch on him. That's incredible that just the recoil, just a boom, Christa, the sonic boom, the impact that that, you know, shocking. His body can do that too, right? There are books out and the government has lots of books out on blast trauma. In fact, one of the amazing things for me to have read was the army did a study on individuals who had had blast damage, blast trauma, no physical Amma just blast, and they put them on a simple product called NSC assisting Nac and those that were on it got better, but how come we're not hearing about what is that stuff in a sealed system? It's a precursor to glutathione, which is the number one anti-inflammatory, excuse me, anti free radical, a antioxidant system in our brain and it's a becomes deficient. It's indogenous within our system of glutathione is the same stuff that you. You recommend taking booze it well, yet glutathione helps with metabolism in the liver to detoxify. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:03       Here's the thing about Nac though also that mark told me and I'm on that product, but if if I was be a. If I was taking that while I was still operating and the problems that I had never would have happened, they would have cut it off so we can essentially cut off these problems just by being proactive and preventative in this way. So if we were right now today to administer to all special operations soldiers in AC, a lot of the problems that we're having out the window,

Speaker 3:          00:11:30       that's crazy. That's crazy, right? It's true medicine, you know, what's going on is all, you know, trying to catch up, always trying to catch up with what we do is proactive. We see patterns in the blood that if we let them keep on sliding until they're sick, they'll get even, you know, absolutely sick in the medical model right now is right this second. You're

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       not sick. Let's wait until you get sick before we do something. One of the more shocking things in working with the UFC is we got involved with. We do these events called fight for the troops. We do them on basis. And uh, we uh, we got involved with the intrepid foundation for Intrepid Foundation for excellent. You find out how, how little money the government gives them and how much they have to raise outside and, and, and doing functions like these big UFC events. And that to me was one of the most disturbing things about those events. I'm like, how is it possible that we can have all this money for all these different missions, all this money for all these different things, but we don't have money to take care of these guys when they come back home. That seems. That seems criminal. Well in unethical. Yeah, at a minimum, at a minimum. What is the highest level? I mean this is if you, if, if you count on soldiers to do what you ask of them and put their body on the line to, to complete missions and then you don't take take care of them when they come back. How do you ever expect anybody to be patriotic?

Speaker 2:          00:13:07       Well, here's the thing, Joe, like there was millions of dollars spent on me personally on my training and then you can't put a number on that experience, right? So to, to produce a special operations soldier, millions of dollars. So it makes sense to put in proper preventative programs to make sure those guys are forming, performing at elite levels. Right? We're going to do that for our weapons systems. We're going to do that for our vehicles, for aircraft. Why would we not do that for the same thing as our guys, but you know what, we're not waiting for anybody else to come up and say, okay, we're going to do this. We, uh, I'm following Dr Gordon's lead started the foundation and we're doing it and uh, we're gonna we're changing it from the inside out, from top to bottom, bottom to top.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       Well, I think maybe it takes guys like you that are on the inside to do that. I feel like the bureaucrats, the people that are in the air conditioned offices that are deciding where money goes, if they don't, they don't have a stake in it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:01       They're disconnected. They're disconnected. So they don't, they don't feel it and they don't understand it, but it, it's, it's simple because we're providing science, evidence based solutions, not, not bitching. Are Griping, complaining, offering solutions based on science. And how long have you been involved in with this foundation? Uh, we started January one of this year. Yep. So just taking off just get. Yeah, I was just medically retired and in June, so I started up. I was actually, I had to go outside of the military medical system to get alternative treatment, alternative being not medication, not psychotherapy and medication. Very similar to when magazine was on here, the navy seal. I was on 13 different meds and for you know, it, you're just, you're, you're not the person that you used to be, you know, I was uh, on elite up capable of performing at an elite level in situations of life, death consistently and reliably.

Speaker 2:          00:14:53       And then all of sudden I have a problem, you know, handling things that just don't add up. You know, your behavior is not right. I can't remember things driving home, I don't know where I'm at. Five years, I've driven that route every day. All of a sudden they look up, you don't know where you're at. Writing a sentence in the middle, in the middle of it. I can't, I don't know what I'm writing about, you know what I mean? So those kinds of things. So it was easy for me to put my hand up and say, Hey, this is, this is psalms going on here, this is not right. And that was basically saying, Hey, I'm on fire, somebody has put this fire out and this kept throwing medication and medication, medication, and then you start having anxiety attacks, which was completely foreign to me. Right. That was something that some other person a week person's problem as I perceived it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:34       And now I'm having these anxiety attacks where I'm breaking down emotionally and crying in public and I, I can't, I have no control over it. And uh, and happening in front of my family, my wife and my kids, and I was just like, hey, enough is enough. And going out, trying to find different things led me to let me demark Dr Gordon. And He, uh, he introduced me to his protocols. He actually sent me an email and the first line he says, Hey Andrew, you know, I'm this and we're doing this and I'm not a coop by the way. And I was like, okay. I liked that, I liked that. I liked that guy. Yeah. Very debatable introduction. I'm not a cook. I'm, I'm interested in what he's doing. Kooks will always tell you they're not kooks. Yeah. No. So that's why I was drawn to him, by the way.

Speaker 2:          00:16:14       Crazy. Yeah. So do you, do you have a specific injury or a specific moment where things changed for, you know, I was an explosive breacher so I was in around explosions for my entire career. You know what I mean? I was only knocked unconscious one time in combat. But the thing that mark was saying, and this is just, this goes outside the veteran population, this goes with anybody. But, um, the symptoms can come in months, weeks, years, days, whatever, later, right? So it wasn't attributed to any one thing. So six months later after my last deployment, I'm starting to have these problems. They're starting to manifest and when I'm, when I'm bringing this up to the attention, you know, it's like, okay, well this is a psychological issue. And I'm like, well, I've been doing this for a long time. This is what I want to be doing.

Speaker 2:          00:17:03       That's bullshit. It's not a psychological issue and here's why I wouldn't be able to perform like this and all of a sudden I just can't do it. And, and, um, so that, that was just very frustrating, you know, in that regard, trying, trying to, to come out and try to find some, some real answers and only like mark said, what it takes is an individualized approach, right. And uh, and that uses evidence based diagnostics to pinpoint and treat the underlying condition. But nobody was trying to figure out my whole story. Um, and, and when you don't do that, you just take, find out what the symptoms are and you treat those symptoms with medication, then you're not, you're not doing anything to fix it. But um, so that's, that's kind of why it's hard to, for, for I think, uh, the medical community understand it right now because if you a problem

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       and you can't necessarily attribute that to a major accident or a major injury or a major explosion, then it's like, okay, well we don't know what it is. It's a psychological problem. We're going to put them on packet a and we'll see how he is in two weeks. Yeah, that expression psychological issue is a real tricky one, isn't it? Because your psychological makeup a lot of times is dependent upon your physical health and what's going on in your body can greatly affect your mind, but when someone says psychological issue, especially for a guy like you, what they're trying to say is that you're weak, right? They're trying to say that you can't handle the pressure salute and that you're cracking and this is what it is, the integrity of it. It's called Comorbid and this is an argument that's going back between the psychiatric world and the non psychiatric world.

Speaker 3:          00:18:39       We're in Comorbid, which came first, the situation that precipitated depression with the depression that's develops the situation in this particular instance relative to Andrew is his chemistry of his body was doing great until he had that group of insults to them. Whether or not it was that huge trump that got blown up 100 feet in the air and you've got the shockwave that knocked you out, um, or the repetitive gunfire that you had or the breaching. How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll? Pop. It's different for everybody. Everybody is so different. So what happens is as you start losing these hormones, I mean one of the hormones that I've repeated a number of times in our repeat again, pregnenolone has been found to control the anxiety affect in the body, in the brain. So morning anxiety or pregnenolone or social anxiety, uh, can be affected.

Speaker 3:          00:19:36       And you know, I have patients who have been in auto accidents who never had anxiety attacks or panic attacks, and they wake up six months after the injury and they've got morning anxiety. They are pregnenolone levels. Instead of being average about 110 are down at six or seven. You correct them back 110, their anxiety disappeared. What is pregnant? Pregnenolone is called the mother of all hormones. It comes from cholesterol. It's the first hormone or steroid hormone, official steroid hormone that comes off of cholesterol. So if we interrupt cholesterol in our body, we lose pregnenolone, which becomes the precursor to the Aga and testosterone on one side and pro progesterone and cortisol and another side. So with low pregnenolone, it can lead to all the hormones that help to regulate our brain function and our life. Cortisol, if you don't have cortisol, you get a syndrome called Addison's disease and you can die and most people associate cortisol with high levels of it being problematic, right? Stress, stress, stress related, and you know, everybody thinks it's emotional stress, but there are five stressors. You know there's emotional or intellectual, emotional stress, physical stress, nutritional stress can precipitate high amount of cortisol. If you're fasting, cortisol goes up and then there's chemical stress like a chemotherapy or certain medication that you take alcohol to. Certain drugs can do it and they can influence the adrenal glands. Production of Cortisol, which is called an adaptogen, which allows you to go from one level of physical functioning, mental functioning to another. It adapts, helps you to adapt,

Speaker 1:          00:21:14       you know? Wow. I gotta tell you when I have these conversations with you about this issue, it's kind of frustrating to me because it seems like you're. You're making all this sense and you're talking about this. This is broad spectrum of different hormones and all these different variables that exist in the human mind and how importantly are to maintain proper levels of them for how for function. But you're just not a lot of people like you out there. They're talking about this like, this is what you're saying is, is a fairly controversial treatment. Dr Gordon to me like this, he's like, this is like 1960 and we're saying we're going to put a man on the moon by 1969 and everybody says you guys are bat shit crazy. You know what I mean? That that's. That's where we're at. It's it seems like. Is it because there's not a lot of motivation for innovation when it comes to treatment or is it a. is it. What's the resistance to understanding all these different variables? If for 30 years

Speaker 3:          00:22:08       plus years you've been told that you treat depression by giving this pill, that's either an Ssri or an Abcd or whatever it is you're going to give that pill and if someone comes in, a coupe comes in and says, look at the literature for the past 35 years, even as far back as 1958 with Dah da Dah da, his antidepressant. You come in with these natural products that have no patents on it, that you can walk into a GNC, you can get it from onnit, you can get it from any of these companies and take it natural, 100 percent natural coming from Mexican wild yams and it fixes your depression and it costs you three cents a day, five cents a day, ten cents a day as opposed to the cost for some of these other medication. Who are you going to believe? This Kook who talks about over the counter product or the pharmaceutical rep who talks about this prescription medication.

Speaker 1:          00:23:03       That is the problem, right? Official sounding names and designations and correct.

Speaker 3:          00:23:08       I got it and it's an uphill battle in the way that I approach it with my science background. Not just medical, but the science research I did in the beginning is to line up all the information, irrefutable information and hand it to someone and read it.

Speaker 1:          00:23:25       See, for a dummy like me who's obviously in the outside of all this, how do I get you in trouble? You got me in trouble. You put that picture. Will you have lunch together and you split here with the brilliant Dr Gordon. I got a lot of shit from your people. Why? Because they said that you know you're. You're a smart guy, and I said, you're absolutely brilliant. Trust me, I'm a dummy dummy. They think I'm smart. It's because if they think I'm smart because they're done with the, call me dumb please. But what I'm saying is like for someone like me that has zero science backgrounds, what I always assume is that the way things got better and the way people figure things out is that they just looked at the facts and then when new facts came in, they adjusted accordingly, but it seems like there's resistance against that. Correct.

Speaker 3:          00:24:12       The status quo is very clearly. We hand everybody this antidepressant. We're not gonna hand them this natural product that's been shown since 1986, 1958 on another large group of research to be beneficial blind washout studies for benefit and depression, natural product. They don't want to use natural products because it's in. It's in essence, as I see it stating that, well, you don't really need the pharmaceutical. You can just get a natural product,

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       so do you think there's just so much money involved in pushing the pharmaceutical drugs that these doctors are reluctant to go against it or not prescribe it or step out on a limb?

Speaker 3:          00:24:52       Well, you know the the medical community, the medical boards of every state. It's the standard of care in your community, which means that if there are 100 doctors in a community of physicians and the standard for 99 percent of them is to use a SSRI. The one doctor who uses a non ssr are I can be pulled into the medical board, has practicing outside the scope of the medical community as well as doctors in general don't want to be looked at as being that one person who is trying to introduce something new, revolutionary, something that's worth something. They worked very diligently at for 21 years to show the science and the clinical cases that it works. It's a maverick and our medical society doesn't work with Mavericks. It works with mass.

Speaker 2:          00:25:44       There's a lot of forces that are kind of stacked up against it, but that doesn't mean that that's a reason to cower and not stand up to it. Right? I mean it's either it's either right or it isn't right and we're saying Dr Gordon is right and we're going to. We're gonna fight it to do our last breath to change it into 300 million people in America on antidepressants. And if, if you're on an antidepressant and you're still depressed, guess what? It's probably not. That's probably not the underlying condition. It's what science has shown us. Its a hormonal imbalance or able to interdict that and effectively treat it. And the problem is, you know, using the term hormone, I've been slowly getting away from the neuroactive steroids, steroids, these neuro active neuroactive steroids are, we'll say neuro steroids. It was

Speaker 3:          00:26:28       found in 1986 by a Dr blue out of bay loop out of Paris, France, that the brain has the chemistry to take cholesterol and to make it into testosterone, make it into pregnenolone, make it into progesterone in the brain. For many, many years, biopsies of the brain would find testosterone it and they thought it came from, you know your testicles or thyroid in the that came from your thyroid gland in the neck. What we're finding is neuro steroids are made what we called the Nova within the brain itself, and when you have trauma or inflammation, you lose that, and that's why I believe based on reading the literature and my interpretation, that's what can be faulted. How I interpret it is that that is the cause for all the transitions in the brain, but there are receptors in the brain that regulate how nerves conduct and what they found is these nerves have not only magnesium.

Speaker 3:          00:27:23       Zinc is a volume receptor, and they found a pregnenolone receptor, so they found a receptor which pregnenolone works to regulate, to smooth out, to calm you down so that you're not having panic attacks or emotional turpitude and yelling, screaming, and picking up a gun and shooting someone or throwing something or yelling or beating someone up, getting assaulted. Her sympathetic nervous system has just gone crazy. The whole, the entire nervous system goes off, so in a sense, what you're saying is there's different types of testosterone, different types of hormones that are produced in different areas of the body that it's not just your testicles that are doing it. Correct. It's the same testosterone. You know, people talk about bio equivalent bio. What is it? Bio identical hormones, testosterone. To be testosterone has to be equal bioequivalent, so the brain produces the same testosterone as the testicles.

Speaker 3:          00:28:20       The brain produces same pregnenolone as the cholesterol elsewhere in the city. When the brain is injured, it no longer produces it at the correct levels, correct. You lose it. In studies that are done in Alzheimer's patients, they found the frontal lobes of the brain, which regulates executive function, making sure that you make the right decision. You're able to make the coffee in the right sequence, making sure the butters at the end is all regulated by the frontal part of the brain, which is the most common area that is damaged in to and fro kind of auto accidents or explosions throw you back, so they found pregnenolone. Pregnenolone deficiency, the same thing. We're finding in boxers, in pugilists, in MMA and everybody, there's a deficiency, and I think I shared with you a nfl did a study where they found that 19 times faster box of nfl players are 19 times more prone to develop Alzheimer's disease between 30 and 50 years of age. What else? Wait a second. Thirty years of age developing Alzheimer's. Did you see that recent study that said 96 percent of all former players have a gte? Yep. Ninety six percent. Ninety six percent. That's incredible. Let's see. Uh, it was 97 out of 98. People have brains that were tested, had cte, which I guess is 96 percent phenomenal. And why don't they do the same testing for military and soldiers?

Speaker 2:          00:29:53       Yeah. What Dr Gordon was saying about all the different neuro steroids, for instance, like cholesterol, he's saying as a precursor to testosterone. So, but if you take a stat and drug that lowers your cholesterol, guess what? The byproduct that is, it messes up your testosterone. So what, what we're understanding is our chemistry is all linked, man. It's all together. If you do, you can't just treat testosterone. If the stuff above it isn't as affected and you're not treating that well, guess what? The military model doesn't even test for that and if you're not treating things below testosterone that, that produces, I'm at that level with it. If it's deficient or insufficient, then you're not going to get what you need. So until you look at your body, your chemistry as a whole and you interdicted accordingly, you're going to continue to have this, these mass problems across the board and the ones that are manifesting and uh, with soldiers, with fighters, with football players. But you know, at the end if you take these drugs, alter it then with the civilian population as well. So it's not just a, like a niche market here, it's everybody is affected by this. So this is the, what's amazing about what Dr Warren's doing. It could fix a lot of things. One of the,

Speaker 3:          00:30:54       the things that has just come up on the table is looking back at the thousand plus people that we've put on a program. Unfortunately we only have about 50 veterans on program. The rest are civilians. What we're seeing is those that are addicted to opioids or narcotics or alcohol addiction are able to get off at rapidly. When Matthew was on here, Matthew was on 15 different drugs of that grouping. He was on eight oxycotton a day and I spoke to him recently specifically about this. He was taking it for 18 months. He was on morphine 40 tablets. It's either 40 or 60 milligrams per tablet and then fentanyl, fentanyl patch, fentanyl patch, which is a pain patch, and in six weeks he was off of 14 of the 15 medications, a pain patch on top of all those pills, but he had. He had surgery on his jaw with six pins.

Speaker 3:          00:31:44       He had treadmill pulled out of his list, left Occiput, and he had his left leg. I think it was shot out and he had chronic pain. That's why he was on all these pain medications. He's off all of that now. Wow. Because you know, vitamin D deficiency has been found to be a cause for inflammation. It also low vitamin D, You have a very low pain threshold. Increasing vitamin D improves that testosterone changes how we perceive pain. I'm stabilizing the pregnenolone and all those hormones in the brain changes how we perceive life. When you're depressed, you perceive pain, very little pain as big pain when you're not depressed. Oh, okay. Bump yourself, get better. Wow.

Speaker 2:          00:32:26       No. When we were having this conversation at lunch, when we're talking about this, you were bringing up stem cells and the, the effect that stem cells are having and stem cell injections on, on people that have all sorts

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       of serious traumatic injuries, is that with the brain as well? Um, have they figured out how to squirt that shit into your dome in, let's see, 19, 2012. I went to Germany to Dusseldorf, Germany to work for the doctors who was taking autologous stem cells. He take out of the patient's stem cells, send them to Israel to get an augmented, to increase the amount and get them back in 48 hours. And then this absolutely incredible three dimensional positioning needle that use three dimension, three axis, these x, y, and Z. and was able to go. We drilled a hole in the skull and we put a needle in directly into the fourth ventricle, which is that fluid compartment in the brain and injected the stem cells and it's spread out to the brain to the brain stem, because this gentleman had a brainstem hemorrhage, and within 48 hours to 72 hours, he started having these improvements, hearing improved physical functioning.

Speaker 3:          00:33:40       He was in a wheelchair with a belt to hold them in place. Three days later, he's not using a belt for 12 years since he had his stroke. He wasn't able to pick up a coffee cup, a coffee Mug, and hold it. He can only use a straw. He was picking up his Coffee Cup and drinking it. So there, there are places around the planet that are using stem cells and people with Alzheimer's, with als, with traumatic brain injury. And it's getting benefits. There are benefits in my projects in Beijing, China, the stem cells called Mesenchymal stem cells, which are the ones that loved the organs come from, uh, in diabetics injecting one injection of 10 million mesenchymal cells into the patient through an IV, 30 percent of them lost their diabetes, a 45 percent and had a decrease in their insulin requirement and 25 percent of them didn't have any effect.

Speaker 3:          00:34:38       And this is a center with 26 md phds in Beijing that tops in their field. So there's a lot of hope in that as well. Correct. That seems like something that would, if you're injecting it directly into the traumatic, the area has experienced trauma. Yeah. There's a, uh, orthopedic, a buddy of mine, a sentinel sentinel who's, um, was using autologous stem cells that he pulled out a patient and injected into the knees and get rebuild of the knees without needing surgery. What I'm hearing too is about rebuilding cartloads that people have had bone on bone cartilage. They're rebuilding it. Correct. There are a couple of protocols. There was one by a Dr Allen are done out of Miami orthopedic surgeon who showed that if you go in with the arthroscopic scope and you use a bird, which is like a, a sandpaper device and you rubbed the bone and then injected with growth hormone that he was able to get five to 10

Speaker 4:          00:35:38       millimeters of regeneration of cartilage in our office. We use prolific, huge significant, and he did a Harvard study that is publication Kane at Harvard. He patented the toe thick, 10 millimeters. That's incredible. Not Ten centimeters. Ten millimeter. Twenty $5 a. that's a pad. Yeah. It's a nice thickness that developed. So um, but no one's doing that because it's illegal to use growth hormone in that fashion. A growth hormone has a very restricted use parameters on it. Why is that? Because like baseball players and shit. Well, I think that had a lot to do with it. Public Impressions of it. This stuff works. It works phenomenally well. That's so frustrating to me when something that's really, really effective gets illegal because athletes are using it and becoming more effective. It's just, it's so silly. It's a complete misconception. It's ludicrous. If the goal is, if the true altruistic goal in medicine is to fix people, then why are we being restricted in using the things that we see fixing people?

Speaker 4:          00:36:40       Well, the stem cell stuff was everybody was always worried that people were going to get it from fetuses and then somehow it's going to encourage abortions until they figured out how to get it from other means and once they figured out how to like get it from. And then now that, that debates off the table, but for the longest time that was the big issue. Like during the Bush administration. Yeah. They held back stem cell research because of the right wing Christians. Right. I think there's one cell, single cell, single cell, single cell. Yeah. Uh, I think it's what, 10 years that they put the moratorium on doing any research in stem cells, which is giving Switzerland is giving China, is giving Russia, you know, massive advantage to be, to be diagnosed clinically as dead, you have to be brain dead. So if there's not even a brain in there, how, how can you say that?

Speaker 4:          00:37:27       Taking a single cell, I mean picking your nose is going to kill more single cells then doing that for stem cell research, but the reaper cut real quick killing your single cells. But the repercussion of that could be a game changer across the for everything. Yeah. I, you know, I used to think of stem cells as well. That's kind of interesting. Uh, some future therapy that's going to be cool until I got a shot into my shoulder and I'm like, holy fuck. Like this is nuts. Like this shoulder is bothering me for a year. Not Bothering me at all anymore. How quick turnaround is that? A couple of weeks. Within a couple of weeks I started feeling great. Now it's two months out. Now it's been two months out. I don't have any pain. PRP or stem cells, stem cells where they get the stem, placenta, placenta, they have a technique which is prp, which is platelet rich plasma, which is similar to.

Speaker 4:          00:38:15       Right. It gets a of cope. Well, it's similar to a Regena cane, right? Except that they don't, they don't. Regeneca is that stuff that Dr Peter Welling figured out in Germany, that's the blood spinning procedure that heat up the blood, like a more advanced version of platelet rich plasma and what they do and I think it Australia, they expose it to a specials frequency of ultraviolet light to take care of any of the inflammatory chemistry that's in there through a photo of the activation and the PRP works very well seen as something that's more acceptable than doing autologous stem cell, which there's a number of ways to do it though, is the point. There's a number of different ways to get stem cells.

Speaker 1:          00:38:58       Yeah, well a lot of UFC fighters getting it now and what they're doing, a good percentage of them or they get their fat sucked out of their body out opposed. They're turning that into stem cells. Then shooting into their knees and their shoulders and what have you, and having incredible results. A lot of MMA fight. A lot of grapplers are doing it. I need to get that done. Yeah, dude, I'm telling you man, I, I, I mean I don't know if mine's an isolated incident, but I'm, I'm just so blown away. I was on the verge of surgery. I was thinking, okay, I'll be out for three months. We'll be in a sling for eight weeks. Baba, I was going over my head how much downtime, what can I do during that downtime? And I was, I was preparing to have a useless shoulder. Now all of a sudden I'm doing everything. I mean with zero pain, it's just, it. Some weird noise is still, it's kind of right, but there's no pain and no limit, no restriction in movement. Like there's no it doesn't, there's no impingements no, no. Jerking off is no problem.

Speaker 4:          00:39:53       I have a. yeah, that's crazy. Mark. I have a non union, my left Fibula, so it's, it's broken and I would love to do that. Non Union and your fibula. Fibula is a small bowl or non white non weight bearing bone in two. I have a metal, a titanium plate and it got broken to pieces on my first deployment and I just never had it fixed. So the plates broken to place broken and uh, so I've been, they've wanted to fix it but they're like nine month rehab and I was like, no way. Nine months. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It doesn't work now. Right, right. So they would take the titanium plate out a re a graph. It had the graph, the graph it take stuff for my hip apparently. And I was just like, it's not worth it. I'm just going to keep on, keep on keeping on.

Speaker 4:          00:40:37       But uh, and then I knew I found out about stem cells and I'm, I'm just gonna wait till I can do that. We'll be back next week. And can the stem cells fix that? They can help with the bones that are non. If they're close enough help with nonunion fusion. Helped with fusion. Well, yeah, it could help regenerate. And then the speed up, the, the therapy time, the turnaround time for your. Well again, you know. Right. So if it's, know if it's nine months now, maybe it's three months. It's just so frustrating when you hear about how much time they spent

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       banning stem cell research because of the new research that they're doing now and regenerating things. I mean, they, they, they've just, they've sequenced the gene of the flatworm and they think they're going to be able to figure out within x amount of years how to regenerate limbs. Like, what the fuck, man,

Speaker 4:          00:41:22       we're, we're getting into some really crazy area with state of science and medicine. So what do we do? We stop using all the technology that can help people today waiting for the technology decade

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       from now on. That's even sillier. Definitely. That's what's happened. It's so fast. No reasons being applied this problem. Yeah. Well, it seems to me that, that, that stem cells would be a really good one for people with traumatic brain injury. I mean, when you think about that, no, I think stem cells is a good option. Um, you know, but what is it that you're looking at? You look at someone who has had a loss of a segment of their brain, you want to try and regenerate it. Um, we know that possible. Well, we know from studies that were done back in 1911, uh, there was a Dr Kegel. Nineteen, 28 is a doc up in mcgill university, a guru, a total girl who's does regenerative research. The only reason why nerves can regenerate is because they're in a non permissive environment is what I call it lecture.

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       I give on this specific topic, is that there are so many chemicals in the brain that are trying to foster regeneration of nerves. Like for instance, usually I just doing a study on a byproduct of progesterone called Aloe pregnenolone, which is neuro regenerative, a snapped agentic, which means that the connection from one nerve to another nerve is a synapse. If it's damaged, it can regenerate. It also pray. Allopregnanolone is a free radical scavenger. As we age, as our biochemistry changes in the energy production in our brain, through mitochondria changes, a lot more of oxidation occurs or free radicals, and that's called oxidative stress and it's believed, especially in great articles by a gentleman at USC, a caliphate. Finch talks about aging of the brain and loss of our functioning due to this oxidative stress, and he believes that oxidative stress leads to hormone deficiency, leads to physical deficiency and death and recent group of articles showed, uh, we're seeing a lot of a type of diabetes called insulin resistant diabetes.

Speaker 3:          00:43:33       Were you making too much insulin because it's not being recognized by the cells. So they found in these group of articles came out that if there's inflammation of an area of the brain called the hypothalamus, which regulates our energy use, that it can predispose you to developing this situation called insulin resistant diabetes or the Metabolic Syndrome. So we've been tracking our patient population who have had significant head trauma, whether or not it's blast with physical injury or blunt head injury. Someone who fell off a second story and hit their head was unconscious for a month. Uh, they're developed, they've developed or they came into the office already with this insulin resistance and it's easy to fix, correct their hormones given chromate and monitor them. What's chromium? Chromium is a mineral metal which is important for insulin recognition at the cell wall. And it was called by c Everett Koop, the, um, the insulin tolerant factor back in the late nineties.

Speaker 3:          00:44:33       So this chromium hooked up to a nice and called chromium poly. Nakota donated. The trade name is called chromate. I, we use it for our patients with type two diabetes called insulin resistance. And they all reverse. They all get better, their blood sugar stabilized, the fats get better and their insulin comes down. So we had, in fact one of our neighbors had an insulin level, a hundred 17. It should be less than 25 once we correct it, is two stops. Drone and his chromium, his levels dropped down below 30, which is where you'd like to have it. You know, I was listening to this radio lab podcast recently and they were talking about lithium. There was a woman who takes lithium because she's a, I guess it's bipolar and uh, I didn't know lithium is just a salt lithium chloride sodium. Yeah. It's just an element.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       And coordinate takes this and she's fun. Yeah. I haven't looked at it, but there are people, you can buy it over the counter now, but very low. Yeah, lithium, you can buy over the counter ended. I haven't. For what? That's what I need to go learn lithium. Yeah, because it seems like for me, ignorantly when I heard that, I was like, well, I thought lithium was some hardcore Prozac type drug that they put people on when they're out of their fucking mind. I didn't think it was just a salt, so it's metal or was it beneficial Dr Gordon or cannot be used for official. Starting to what started it was I would see patients coming in with bipolar and being on lithium and then started seeing patients who are coming in on it, you know, just taking it as because of articles and life extension magazine or one of those other science based journals or magazines.

Speaker 3:          00:46:18       But I haven't had a chance to go and look at it closely, but it's very impressive. It's the metals, you know, it's like a magnesium works on one of the brain receptors that if you take magnesium, it'll make you calm. Magnesium metal, you're talking about a solid magnesium carbonate magnesium. Zinc makes your testosterone goes up, right? Correct. Zincs involved in 300 processes in the body, it's anti viral and anti cancer and it's anti Alzheimer's and 300 processes in the body. One of them is a natural Roman tastes inhibitor, so I've never used the idexx in my practice or an astros salt in my practice. What does that mean? Aromatase inhibitor, aromatase swelled. Testosterone converts to Estradiol naturally and it's the body adapts to what we do to it. If you give an overwhelming amount of testosterone to the body, the body says, oh, now what am I going to do with this?

Speaker 3:          00:47:08       So it will either send it down to estrogen, Estradiol, or it'll send it to another thing called dihydrotestosterone. Estrodial obviously get man boobs. She got crying, whipping and so forth. And dht causes hair loss, causes testicles to show how you looked at my head when you said that. Well, saddleback back. So, um, there are side effects. So, um, in, in replenishing testosterone, you have to be careful with the balance you use. Otherwise you start throwing things in like an astro which blocks Esta dial, which is extremely important for generating growth hormone in the brain, helping blood flow and keeping the immune system unique to the brain functional. So you know, everything we do, there's always a risk to benefit factor that needs to be looked at. And I think that some of the risk factors are being ignored.

Speaker 1:          00:47:55       This woman in this, uh, this radiolab podcast, he was having an issue with kidney failure and they were going to make her get off of the lithium. The lithium has a negative publicity,

Speaker 3:          00:48:05       well, it has toxicity and it's dose dependent toxicity. And then the uniqueness of the person's biochemistry, you can make a very low amount toxic for you or another person and it's meaningless

Speaker 1:          00:48:16       to silver. This woman who was this massive conflict because this, this stuff was saving her when she had allowed her to be herself and now all of a sudden they were telling her, you're going to have to get off of it. And she had been off of it before and just lost her marbles, saving her and killing her at the same time. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. It's A. is there another way that people can avoid that? Is there, is, there is another way that it could have. They could avoid the effects of being bipolar, exercise, diet, anything. Well, do you want to say anything about that Andrew?

Speaker 3:          00:48:49       Um, we, we think that you can treat that by treating a neuroactive steroids in the brain. And, uh, it's, it's been shown that it's been backed up by evidence and proof and his clinical application as well. But that's very much the case. So how does that work? I'm testosterone is a generally perceived as being a sex hormone or being a reproductive hormone. What we're finding is that it's involved in an incredible array of different processes in the body, uh, studies on the emotional center of the brain. The limbic system found that it helps to stabilize a panic and also anger and aggression in reactiveness to our environment. If it's slow, you're hyper reactive. They're finding that in a Anorexia Nervosa, uh, women who are starving themselves, who do have a psychological issues to it, if they don't respond to treatment, giving them testosterone improves it. So what we're starting to see is these, a neuro steroids and neuroactive steroids have influence on an array of, um, psychological or mood disorders and one of them is in bipolar in the case that we're just touching on, um, gentleman who was diagnosed with bipolar by the military and was put onto lithium and also add at the same time. So, and then what happened was he was given a challenge test with a low dose of testosterone and within 32 hours or so, Dana has symptoms disappeared. That's incredible. The,

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       the, the combination of things working together synergistically. It was one of the most incredible parts of it. Correct it. And this is something that, it just seems that a lot of people just simply not aware of.

Speaker 3:          00:50:39       Correct. The analogy that I use is, you know, brand new corvettes, absolutely bitch and cars, and it's like having a corvette with four flat tires. Now all we're going to do is going to fill up one of the tires with air and you're going to try and drive the car. You're not going to be able to drive the car. Let's fill up the front two tires and drive. Okay, let's go and fill up three and a half tires and you going to drive. It's not going to happen. The synergy is in all the hormones that we have in our body, all the chemistry together to give us a level of benefit of function that one by itself cannot do, and if you look at the failure reports that are in traumatic brain injuries since 1959, it's called a futility failure where these big pharmaceutical companies took these great drugs and gave one product to an individual which Madec brain injury and they didn't get any benefit greater than 10 percent. That's called failure or futility failure, and it's because in other people are writing the because is because our system is so complex. How do you expect one product to fix it? It can't

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       and everything's got to be balanced. It's all got to be balanced. There's such an issue in this country when it comes to mental health that mental health doesn't get looked at like the health of a bone or the health of a muscle. You know, if you have a torn muscle, you have to get an emergency operation to reattach it. Right. But if your brain is fucked, it's like, come on, don't be a pussy. Yeah. You know, toughen up or, you know, stop. Stop being so down on yourself. We're this. We're the sum of our chemistry. I mean that, that, that's the deal. When that's affected, that's when you have these, uh, these different things that manifest

Speaker 3:          00:52:19       why we're seeing so many of the vets coming back and committing suicide because they've been instilled with exactly what you say. Don't be a pussy, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:52:27       man up and do it. That's what. Yeah, it was then. And that's why it was easy for me to say, well, I can speak to my credibility that that's not the case. So let's find, let's find some damn answer, right? Because we're flying, falling off the crazy train. Right, right, right. Yeah. For a guy like you, that's where it's so clear. It's like, you know, you're not a pussy, so what the hell's going on? For example, that have self doubt. It's like, well maybe they're right and maybe with that psychologist says is right, maybe I should take this medication and now that's compounding a problem and making it even bigger and that's why we're having these suicides. And also, you know, one of the things that's been fascinating to me over the last couple of years is finding out all the different things that we do that change a hormone levels of our body. Like all the different things you could do during the day that up your testosterone, including like just drop what they called peacocking driving a nice car around a bunch of young ladies actually rises, raises your testosterone like, ah, what the fuck is going on with our bodies? Like weird. Is it

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       that there's like moods, the changing and mood, like happy moments? Correct. Like literally will change the chemical evolution, makeup

Speaker 2:          00:53:34       evolution of man, you know what I mean? And that was a natural selection that when women were around, I was gonna you know, you're going to perk up and down,

Speaker 3:          00:53:42       got to get ready to party when a woman opulate said they, you know, 14, 15, 16, there's a spike in testosterone. So she's oblating. She has a spike in her testosterone. What does she want to do? Get Our party on, get up, party on. She wants to get that fertilization, dance, going to dance. That's happened. That happens also to a lot of women that get older when they put them on hormone replacement, once they experience menopause, they, they have more testosterone. They get hornier correct. If you just follow, I'm aging, uh, men and women as men who had testosterone based age, they lose their testosterone and they have more estrogen. That's why we become clear stages as we get older. Women on the other hand lose their estrogen and gain more testosterone. That's why you start seeing facial hair and they start taking the command position in the relationship as they get older. And it's this flipping of the,

Speaker 2:          00:54:37       the hormones. Hey Doctor Gordon, I wanted to touch on the a and Joe, you asked about the, uh, able to regrow anything in the brain. It's called neuroplasticity, you know, right. Doctor Gordon, and I wanted to dumb it down for the listeners are guys that maybe are like me that are listening, so are, are we able to fix our brains? And Science has said yes. And I found this out before I met Dr Gordon and I was hearing about some of these things and treatments I was at about neuroplasticity and basically being able to regenerate the neuronal pathways. Okay, so we have shearing a shearing of the neurons and a traumatic brain injury and, and that's causing some of the issues that we have, but when, what we now know is we can form new neuronal pathways in the brain and we can stimulate stimulate that through a number of ways. Learning something that you've never learned will stimulate that. I'm treating it with what you're deficient in, new oral steroids steroid wise. We'll fix that. So we thought like, can't you, can you treat a. can you teach a old dog new tricks? We thought the answer was no, but now we know that that's not correct. We can regenerate neuronal pathways in the brain. Anybody can do it, and you can keep yourself. You can continue to get sharper as your age through these treatments.

Speaker 3:          00:55:48       I think people get sharper to when they try new things. Absolutely.

Speaker 2:          00:55:53       That's part of the. That's part of the science behind. Okay, well that, that builds new neural pathways and we didn't think that that was possible. I don't know how long we just figured that out, but when I heard that two years ago and people were telling me, hey, this is the new. You just accept it. And I was like, well this is the last class. I was not told me about neuroplasticity. So which one is it can regenerate and renew or you can't.

Speaker 3:          00:56:12       I think it was Fort Collins and a doctor twilley twilley who was doing just that. Introducing two vets who had traumatic brain injury, would nintendo with certain types of gains to get the visual manual dexterity which would help to improve their cognitive ability because of doing just that, using learning something new. Uh, what's that thing called? [inaudible]. So Dakota. Yeah, so do Duke, which, uh, forces you to do a intense thinking which can help build a new pathways in literature that I used to read in Alzheimer's. I have a lecture on it. There's, um, they found that if you looked at the academic, uh, the academic experience of an individual when they get Alzheimer's, the people have the highest academic achievements, meaning mds, phds, and so forth compared to people who just have a high school diploma, that those people with the higher education have a slower progression of Alzheimer's disease. And that's because they've built parallel pathways, a lot of pathways. So if you lose this pathway, you've got this one is an alternative backdoor, backdoor backup side of the door. Yeah. So, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:57:25       well, it also makes sense in relation to exercise. The more exercise that when people don't actually. Absolutely. They experience atrophy, right? When you know, when your, your, your life has exact same path every day, the exact same stimuli. Nothing varies when that, when that happens, it's a very easy for your mind did just atrophy your, you're correct. Your process. You don't challenge yourself in life, then you're going to atrophy in every area so that that's the onus on the individual. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's also by people that are sort of adrenaline junkies, they, they kind of ramp it up all the time. More and more and more to the other people around them. Like, you're fucking getting a little crazy here, buddy, but it's because it, it takes more for them to get that juice. Right. They don't get it from the original. Their baseline is pushed higher. Yeah, fine.

Speaker 3:          00:58:14       You know, I have patients who get onto a program and after for six months they say, doc, I don't feel the same as I did at the beginning. I said, well, at the beginning you were at zero, now you're at 100. We're at the top. What more? You've already had that contrast from zero to 100 and the analogy I use is, you know, it's 100 degrees outside and you've got to pull the. It's 86 degrees when you jump into the pool, it's initially cold and then your body adapts and you don't feel that temperature difference. Is the temperature any different? No, it's the same thing. You've adapted. So what happens is we adapt to not feeling the contrast because there's no contrast. You're already at the top. Does that make any sense? Yeah, totally makes sense. Yeah. So this is what people have to understand and you know, every week I get one or two patients, you know, call up and say, doc, I just don't feel as good as I did in the beginning.

Speaker 3:          00:59:04       Have you changed? Have you dropped in your functionality? No. In fact, I'm going to be running a, you know, a marathon. Well, were you able to do that last time? No, I'm not. Now I'm in the gym six days a week instead of once a week or once a month. I said, your entire lifestyle is updated, but you're not feeling as good and I just can't get a full understanding. Their level of function is up here, but they are telling me that they're not doing as well. And is it just because they're just, they're used to it? Is that what it is? It's a massive improvement. They had in the beginning it was like this new state. It's almost like getting water in your ear and it. Yeah. And then the water comes out. It's a contrast. Hormones always give the body a contrast beef between low level and that higher level, not excessive but higher level.

Speaker 3:          00:59:49       And you adapt to it and you think it's. You know what happens with heroin addicts, it's a bad example, but the same thing, they get what's called techie flax. They don't feel the same. Hi, everybody chases that first high and you're never going to have that first high because that was the first time that you just whacked all your neurons in your brain with this new drug. Heroin or chasing the Dragon, chasing the dragon. Correct. But it makes sense. I mean, when something is unique in the, in the beginning and special and fantastic. He gives you this. But then when that's a normal thing, right? Then you go, you know, what worked for me in the beginning and then it stopped working for them. It hasn't changed and you'd show them their blood levels, their blood levels, like at a, um, in fact it was a, I think it was Jordan who, uh, was very, very low in testosterone.

Speaker 3:          01:00:35       I think it was like a two when it should be a 14 and his total was like two, uh, 220 and should be about 700 and he complains that he's not feeling as well. We did his blood work and his free testosterone was like 14, 13 point nine, nine in total was 801, so it was like four times above where he was before. And he's saying he doesn't feel any better. That's crazy. So he just got used to this elevated state. He's at functioning at a higher level, you know, I've been on treat happens. The rich people too, right? Is that right? Yeah, that's what they say.

Speaker 2:          01:01:07       Using a ball, you, uh, you start to crave different things, right? And, but the problem with that is we lose focus and the clarity of the present moment. That's the problem, man. I crave a different emotion when you need to be experiencing the most that you're having right now. Living, living in that part of it.

Speaker 3:          01:01:25       The problem of being a fucking person is because we're always striving for the new thing. We're always striving for improvement. We always want a better time at our run. We always want a better this better that. The newest car, the fucking uptight to the house, all that shit when we're constantly, when no one has ever like, hey, that's pretty good. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       I think that apathy, I think it's chasing certain emotions and trying to run away from other ones when, when there's, there's opportunity for growth and development and ultimately contribution and all of them and they're all, they all can produce that. If you're able to instead of run from it, maybe look at it and see what that can provide you and what can, what can you do that to provide that to somebody else.

Speaker 3:          01:02:07       Yeah. It makes sense. Totally makes sense. It just seems to me that, um, the way you approach life and the philosophy that you have, that you take through life can either they can even contribute

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       or take away from your happiness and that it's, it's not, it's all these things. It's not just the hormonal balance, it's not just the health of the physical body, but it's also the approach that you have to live, the way you look at things can sort of affect and, and, and balance all that stuff out in a way. Meaning that you need everything. You need the big

Speaker 4:          01:02:39       picture. Absolutely. I think if you wrap your happiness around passion or our pleasure, those are, those are fleeting. You know what I mean? So if you could been instead wrapping around purpose or meaning, then you're going to be a longterm happy, uh, but pleasure, passion, things like that, that, that, that, that short term people chasing pleasure, man. And that, that doesn't make you happy in the end.

Speaker 1:          01:02:58       No. You know, my friend Steve Reno has a really funny way of. He talks about things that are really fun when you're doing them. And then things are that are really fun after they're done, he's like, some things are really fun while you're doing them, but after they're done, they don't give you any. Like a rollercoaster rollercoaster doesn't give you anything after it's over. But like there's some miserable trips that you go on. Well afterwards, just spend hours and hours laugh with your friends. Like, dude, that sucks so hard. Absolutely. He'd be laughing about how fucking cold you were and you're camping and you're freezing your dick off. We want to blow my nose. But you know,

Speaker 4:          01:03:35       remembering a perceived negative time and putting a positive light on it. You know what I mean? Absolutely.

Speaker 1:          01:03:40       It's also understanding that a lot of like what is good is very difficult to do and it becomes like your goal setting and then achieving those goals becomes this, this feeling of of pleasure and a good thing. Whereas opposed to so many people just want comfort and quiet and peace, but with none of the hard work and that you don't appreciate it then absolutely. You like a spoiled child, like spoiled kids don't appreciate what they have in their life. Somebody works really hard and you know they've gone through hard times. Then when things turned well, they're like, God, this is so good to not have to worry about money now, to not have to worry about where my next meal's coming from, to have a nice home and a nice bed to sleep in.

Speaker 4:          01:04:25       Yeah. If you look at the Richard Bransons and the job's and so forth that came from nothing and they built something. They worked. They were hungry and develop something or had a world that was fulfilled. Everything that they could think of a they had the desire to achieve that goal as opposed to people who are given everything on a silver platter. They don't have aspirations. They don't have the drive. I think you achieved that goal. That is kind of pleasure. You're talking about Joe, but like the we look back and look at the journey that it took from where you started to get to that goal. That's where you can feel purposeful and proud of proud of it. That last longer than the feeling of accomplishing that goal. The journey.

Speaker 1:          01:05:04       Yeah. It's what a weird world we live in, isn't it, you know, trying to manage all this stuff and trying to figure out what, what's the most, what's the optimum way to get through life, what's the best way to approach it, how much emphasis to put

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       on the mind, how much emphasis to put on the body, the relationships that you have with the people in your life greatly affect how, how you feel about life in the people in your life could, they, can affect your hormone levels. They can affect your, your cortisol levels. They can affect all those things. He has his daughter having a, you know, someone said that I talk a lot and I tell them that because of having four women in home, three daughters and a wife, that the uh, Opportunity that I have to speak is always outside because inside the house, you know, he just listened. I just listened. Just trying to sort out these aliens that you live with and other especially matched you. I got three daughters. I have two on the same package. Yeah. I also got two boys, so commiserate later. Full House. You got chaos.

Speaker 4:          01:06:07       That's how we live, like I said, in feces, urine and nonstop, but as they get older, they mature into this delight as my daughter over there and the other two daughters that are in here. Just a delight and that journey you were talking about and the effect of the environment on your psychological wellbeing. You know, it's a. it's a rollercoaster that I've gone through a rollercoaster with each one of the daughters and I've come to that landing. You know, where you get off the rollercoaster finally at this age and you look back and you start laughing on some of the silly things that happened and my daughter came to me a couple of weeks ago and basically said, yeah, we went through some silly time. Let's have some great time. And it was one of the most revelator ing kind of nights I could have had.

Speaker 4:          01:06:55       It was the best night and going out and having a good, you know, 40 year old scotch or something. But you owe me that. This, this last year, I read a Victor Frankel's man's search for meaning and it just changed my outlook on everything and he went through the Holocaust and that basically the book was the premise of some people survived the Holocaust and they like the Holocaust. That's the text, that's a text and then me Holocaust. Some people survived, right, and we're able able to to have meaning while others just gave up and died and what was. What was the reasoning behind that? Was kind of how the book looked at it and it was the people who survived that nine percent was the commonality was his. Everybody had some kind of a meaning, right? Some somebody has some kind of purpose outside of themselves that was wrapped in a how they could better, better somebody else's life in some form or fashion and that purpose, that meaning to their life allow them to be able to endure whatever came their way because they had a purpose to endure it. The person that didn't have a meaning a put on their life for whatever reason, just at the end, that was too much. They just gave in and said, I give up and eventually died and that was the difference. You know what I mean? And we can replicate that in our own life. I mean you can wrap your life around meaning and purpose and

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       tie that to how you can contribute to, to put value into somebody else's life. I found that puts value into you. You know what I mean? So I think the, you know, the purpose of life is to live a life of purpose. That's a very good way of putting it and it makes you feel better about your life too. And like cynical people will say, well, there is no purpose in the end. You know, you're going to take a dirt nap and that's all the time that you have here is just bullshit. But the reality is that bullshit is way better when you believe that you have a purpose and when you live for a purpose and when you work hard and you achieve things like goal setting, they say that one of the most important things for people to achieve happiness is this setting and achieving of goals.

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       It's setting and achieving of goals, whether it's simple like completing a project, I want to start a garden in my yard, you know, and you want to put up posts and grow plants and then when you eat a salad from those plants you go, I fucking did it. Like you get a feeling, a natural feeling of accomplishment from an art project, from anything you want to do, fixing the shed, what, whatever it is. Like when you set a goal and you do your best and you achieve. That's part of what made human beings what we are today in 2015. Those, those natural reward systems are in our DNA. And if you follow those and you live by those, you will have a more fulfilled life, a happier life. I agree. I agree. And it's, it's a fulfillment. It's a joy that you get that you don't have need anybody else to say to you, good job [inaudible] because it's self generated.

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       It's your own self reward as opposed to people's search for other ones. Someone else to tap them on the back. You know, people come up to me and you know, I'm very sensitive about the fact that people say, what a great job I'm doing whatever I'm doing, I know I'm doing a good job because that's my purpose. That's my purpose. I don't need to have someone to tell me to, you know, I've been doing a good job. You're not a slack. Like if you weren't doing your best, you'd be, you'd be going against yourself. Right? So you don't need anybody very hypercritical about myself because you know, you look around the planet, how many people are putting in effort for helping other people? I mean really truly helping without helping them. Not that I do 100 percent because I'm selfish. I need to have my couch in my car and whatever else.

Speaker 1:          01:10:28       Trying to improve wellbeing, improved wellbeing across the board. Yeah. There's really no good manual on how to live life. And even if there was, it might not apply to you, you know? I mean, nobody can tell you what's going to make one person happy. It's not necessarily gonna make another person happy. You know, we're, we're here talking about goal setting and working hard and trying for some people, that's actually not it for some, for some people, what do they want to do? They just want to have a good group of friends and be around them and have nice meals and good conversations and that's it. They literally don't have a desire for these other things. But for people like you that have this burning desire to know things and improve upon things and to do good work for, that's

Speaker 4:          01:11:13       your path. That's it. I think some people just get so wrapped up in the day to day rat race of life that they don't put the pick their head up and say, man, I, I, I, I'm totally missing the boat. And there, there is no meaning. There is no purpose to how I'm doing anything. I would think people really thought about it. They might not be do what I, you know, Joe Rogan Westview or Mark Gordon wants to do, but they're, they're going to like, hey, I want to do something. If it's not just tied around, totally doing, you know, I just want to hang out and not give anything out to anybody. You're not gonna get anything in return. I don't think anybody wants to do that and in their right mind, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:11:47       it's so hard for people to find out what it is that they want to do and then how do I go about pursuing that and how do I go about pursuing that while avoiding the idea of choosing just a job that's going to give you security, you know, a job that you don't want to do, but hey, you know it's going to give me dental there. That's a. that's a big factor in a lot of people's lives. The non pursuing of dreams that somehow and you to go streams or danger,

Speaker 4:          01:12:11       you got to go after it with your, with no fear of failure. If that didn't, don't even let failure enter into the equation. What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail at it? That's what I would tell people to do. That's what I tell my kids. Whatever you're passionate about, that's where you need to start. You know what I mean? That's where you need to go and get dental.

Speaker 1:          01:12:27       You're going to have failure. But failure is important for growth and learning. Uh, you know, I have it all the time. It's, it's, it's, it's good. It's like a vitamin. You gotta take it, fill fuel yourself with the fuck up. So that's what I always say,

Speaker 4:          01:12:39       talking about failure. One of the stories I keep on repeating and using as a goal for myself is it was a reporter that interviewed Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Edison, before he passed away. And he said to him, you know, Mr Edison and your development of the incandescent bulb was what revolution I took us from the stone ages to modern living and you know, but how do you feel about these over 1,108 failures that they said that you had with the bulbs? And Thomas Edison says, well, sunny, I don't look at them as being failures, justice, things that didn't work. And it's by having that attitude of looking at what we do in our daily life is not failures. Meaning that you're worthless and you're incapable and therefore you should stop what you're doing, but look at it. It's just something that didn't work. Find another pathway.

Speaker 1:          01:13:30       The data. Great. Thomas Edison impression, by the way, you very much is a southern. When did he become from Alabama? Where was he called? The Ohio. Well, not only that, he ripped off Tesla, me know. That was really how he got ahead. That guy was just. He hated the alternate current lecture, shooting fucking elephants and shit. DC. Remember that? He liked you, but that Alpha is all about direct. Current. Yeah. He fucked up. That was a dumb ass. It was just lucky. There was a super genius around that he could steal from. Well, I'm sure he was smart. Yeah, don't get me wrong, but we kind of helped. Helped being around Tesla. I mean that's that Michael Jordan commercial, you know, like about how many times you've failed, failed over and over and over again, and that's why it's succeeded. Like he said, man, it makes that, that spurs growth.

Speaker 1:          01:14:14       You know, you have to be able to fail. I look at it as data, you know what I mean? That just, that gives me readings about where I was and how I need to self correct the course I'm at. Without it, you can't get a good true measurement and that feeling that you get from failure is awesome. It sucks at the time, but it's like the like we were talking about things that are fun while you're doing them and then things that are great years later, when you fail at something, that feeling that you have afterwards, it's fucking horrible, but that feeling will fuel you. That feeling will get you to avoid that, so that's what it's there for, but you got to rearrange the way you look at it. People look at it like, Oh, I'm a failure. You can't define yourself by mistakes.

Speaker 1:          01:14:57       You what you who you are is you are the thinking thing. You are the thing that can figure out what the problem is, how to, how to form a solution. You're not the results like you're not the failures and that's what a lot of people run into. They define themselves by failures and people try to define you by failures, like how many times you run into someone from higher. Remember that time when you're in high school, you did this. Not like, Hey Dickhead, that was 20 years ago. You're still living there. You know, I learned from that and I moved past it. That happens with a lot of people, right? That people will try to drag you into. Like I had a friend of mine who, uh, he had to get up. He had a breakup with this girl because he was dating her. When they would talk about things, they would have a disagreement about something that she did and she would bring up something that happened like fucking two years ago that had nothing to do with it.

Speaker 1:          01:15:45       Like you did they give you. And then you said that he was like, it was too fucking years ago. What do you, what are you talking about? Has No bearing on who we are right now? None. Zero. She's not being rational. You. She was trying to define him by, uh, an argument that they had, you know, two years ago or whatever comments like, you know what I mean when people are doing that, they're trying to define them based on a failure as a team guy, man, anybody on the guy I want on my team is a guy who's failed and failed and failed and every time he got back up and he said, I don't, I don't give a shit. I'm going to keep going because I know when, when the bullets start flying and the day gets tough, we're going to keep moving. Show me somebody who's never failed ours one every time.

Speaker 1:          01:16:27       And as soon as they have a perceived adversity or difficult situation, they don't know how to act. I don't want that guy on my team, especially when it's life and death. You know what? That's a big issue with fighters. Yeah, with fighters, that's a giant issue. It's called being a front runner and there's some guys that just, they don't do well when they're the the nail. They're great when they're the hammer, but when then all of a sudden they're the nail. They don't know what the fuck to do and they fall apart. There's certain guys that if they're dominating a fight to the most terrifying fighter in the world, but the moment things start going the way you start seeing cracks in their arm or you start seeing mental weaknesses and they fold and they perform at a drastically reduced level with no reason, well the reason it's psychological, all of a sudden they're confronting it.

Speaker 1:          01:17:08       Adversity. They're confronted, they don't know what to do, and then when you see a fighter that's able to cable, able capable of being hurt and on the brink of failure and then coming back and winning a fight, then you see a person with character and then there's other people that they're great when everything's going their way, but the moment things aren't going their way. They just fucking pack up their bags and go home. That's what I love to watch is the guy that those fights were. The guy was down and he didn't. He didn't stop pain. You learn a lot about God. You said Joe, their character. That's where he learned about somebody's character is this kid that fights in the UFC right now. His name is Thomas Almeda is very, very, very highly hyped up fighter and he had a real tough fight recently with this guy named Brad picket.

Speaker 1:          01:17:51       Brad pickets, a tough veterans. Been around for a long time. This kid I'll made has been beating everybody up and then all of a sudden he gets in this fight with his veteran and he gets cracked. His nose gets broken. He gets rocked really hard, came back the next round and knocked out, knocked pick it out. It hit him with a flying knee and knocked him out. But the point being that this kid got pushed to the brink, never lost composure, and then you go, okay, the hypes real this kids a real deal, and you got to see that. You've got to see that to know because otherwise you don't know what happens when they get in trouble. Absolutely getting in trouble, like being able to operate while under that kind of intense pressure of being in trouble is what makes champions, hey, how do you replicate that in the fight world and and training for a guy to be able to be in that situation to where, hey, this is what's going to feel like and this is how you need to respond or can you replicate that?

Speaker 1:          01:18:40       You almost can't. I mean, I think that that kind of mental training, it's, it's, it's so difficult to try to replicate that. There's certain drills you can do like you do. I'm a drill. We take five fresh guys and you go in and you spar one guy for one round and then that guy goes out and you bring a new fresh guy and you're tired. That guys, they, they try to break you. They try, but there's also people that don't agree with that because they think that that kind of like experiencing failure like that in the gym is actually a bad thing because then you become comfortable with failure and you understand it and some people think that it's just an attribute that's a psychological attribute. Either you're in shape and you're prepared and you're ready and when adversity comes you're going to be able to handle it or you're not.

Speaker 1:          01:19:23       You know, it's, it's, it's really tough to put an answer to that because it's really tough. Like think about like buds training or think about like how many people go through that, that kind of training and just get to the point where everybody's uncomfortable, everybody's miserable, but they get up and they quit and who doesn't quit? The people that don't quit at the people that you're going to count on, like why? Why, why this is their first time doing because they made the decision beforehand. I can tell you they made the decision beforehand like I don't care what happens and how much it's going to suck. In my mind. I have now embraced it and I've told myself that I'm an enjoy it and no matter what, I'm not quitting it. I'll lose a leg before I quit, but if you have even the slightest inkling of this sucks, I can't believe I have to do another 20 miles and hump 100 pounds.

Speaker 1:          01:20:13       Then you're thinking it's easy to step off to the side over there and be done, but if you have a mental mind frame and you can train it, if you had that mental mind frame of I will not they they're, they might not take me, but it won't be because I didn't finish this damn thing. It won't be because I'm not physically and mentally here doing everything that's asked of me. Well, when you say you can train it, they don't try to trade it in you though before they prepare you? No, absolutely not. They want the person who does it on their own. Innate. I think it's the same with fighters. Yeah, I really do. Either you have it or you don't. Yeah, and that's why similarly, there's just a small percentage of people that ever get through that kind of training. There's similarly a small percentage of people that ever get to the elite level of competition.

Speaker 1:          01:20:55       I think in any form, in any sport, in anything where you're trying to push yourself, anything that's difficult, not really difficult. Endeavor reveals character. Yeah, it's beautiful. It's a beautiful process is, it's amazing and it's amazing to see in yourself and even, you know, the people that experience it would, they quit even that can be a lesson, you know, you can learn from that lesson and rebuild and, and never, never experienced that. Again, have a curiosity in your training. What percentage of people actually complete the training? Um, so through our initial special forces assessment and selection, only about 33 percent get through that. Then you go through the training pipeline, which is anymore for about a year and a half to two, two and a half years. And that's about 50 percent of the people I think, you know, so you get 16 percent will get through. It's, yeah, it's a very small percentage and that's people that have the courage to join.

Speaker 1:          01:21:46       Right. So you know, you think about how many people were willing to sign up. I mean that's a small percentage to, so a small percentage of a small percentage of a small percentage. Everybody wants to be a cool guy and until things go wrong, oh yeah, man, nobody wants to be anymore what it is with the seals. And so it's, it's, it's very similar. Similar to it. Yeah. It's kind of be, it's almost all very, very small percentage. So the question is if it's 16 percent in that arena, what is it in, in, in boxing, MMA or fighting mma? There's also, there's a lot of physical gifts that come into play. Like we're talking about guys that quit, there's guys that quit that are at the elite level and they just, they just don't run into anybody as good as them. And as long as they keep training, they keep pushing ahead, they'll, they'll bulldoze and bum rush.

Speaker 1:          01:22:34       All these guys that are in there with them. But there's guys, you know, I don't want to mention names, I don't wanna hurt anybody's feelings. This guys have won world titles that are quitters. Yeah, it's a fact. They're just really good or they've been cheating. It's been a lot of steroid use epo, a lot of different things. But even then they have to fine tune those skills. I mean, any anybody can do, do those drugs and they can't hit a home run or they can't put somebody in a rear naked choke. They're not entirely week. See, you know, they might, they might. Like, some people can run a marathon, can run an ultra marathon. Can you do 100 miles in 24 hours? A lot of people can't, but some people can. So the people that run that ultra marathon, they'll look at other people that can't run a marathon.

Speaker 1:          01:23:15       Or the people that run a regular marathon will look at people that can't run a marathon, that will quit at Mile Sixteen or whatever. And they'll go, wow, you just fucking don't have the mental toughness. Maybe they don't have the mental toughness to go 100 miles. There's levels to everything in this life and there's people that are at the elite level of MMA that I know. I know that if they get in a bad spot, they're going to quit. They're going to breaking point. I can tell you that for a fact. Every, every, every human has a breaking point, so there's no. There's no unbreakable dude walking around today. No. Even though he my thanks. So yeah, a lot of people think so. A lot of people think so without ever being tested and I don't even think they think it. I think they're just saying it so that they think that they can convince you and maybe somehow know that will convince themselves if you believe it.

Speaker 1:          01:24:00       Yeah. Is it nurture? Is it nature? Is it just good question? What they want to do? Is it a psychological decision to do it or is it their matrix of how they're put together? This is the limit of their capacity. I had this puppy, and this is obviously a dog, another person, but I had this dog. His name was Frank Sinatra. Craziest fucking dog I've ever had who's nuts. His mother was a wild boar hunting dog from Hawaii. His dog was fucking crazy. He was crazy. But uh, when he was a puppy, one of the reasons I realized he was crazy. He was a, he would always like to play bite and stuff. He was really little. It was only two months old. I, uh, you know, he would come up to me and bite my hands and I'd push him away and he'd run up a bite my hand again and I pushed him away and I'm like, how many fucking times can I do this?

Speaker 1:          01:24:45       I pushed him away 80 times before I got tired of doing it. I go, one, two, three, four. I'm a fucking human. Okay. I'm a grown man and he's a baby dog and I'm pushing him away from me and he never got discouraged. Not once at, at number 80. I'm like, all right buddy, bye my hand. Let's just, let's just call this a lot. But like, that was 100 percent nature, not nurture and dog that I've taught them to do is get pat and given dog food, give him kisses. But in his hitting his makeup and there's that question of epigenetics, like what, how much of your character do you get from your parents? Like just in your DNA, how much can you mold on your own? I mean, I think there are. There's an untold number of variables and nature and nurture. It's neither or it's all the above.

Speaker 1:          01:25:40       Absolutely environment. There's so many different things that are. So, you know, you can't really, you know, put these people down for not being able to succeed at the level that you've like to. You did with this super marathon or the marathon reimbursement. It does. Like I do a five k and I'm wasted. I'm not a runner or a swimmer. But if you decided you were a runner and then put in the work, you would be a runner given any mean whether your knees hold up or ankle problems or all that jazz. If you decided to, you can do. It's not outside the realm of possibility. It's not like you can't fly. Well, I can't fly either. You know, I don't have wings. You know what I mean? Like we're talking about nonphysical limitations. It's a simple thing like running, not saying, well, you beat Usain bolt in a hundred yard dash. No you won't, you know, but we're talking about some simple stuff, making the commitment to do it and keep it and just keep them commitment and you have the physical and mental capacity and then just whether you're going to be committed and whether or not you're going to embrace the suck. I've been committed before.

Speaker 2:          01:26:35       That's the difference, Joe, instead of turning from whatever you're doing, embrace it, man. You have to truly embrace it. Embrace the suck. Then it's not something that you're trying to get out of you. You're trying to live in that moment and, and truly thrive in it. And that's the difference. But the elite performer and anomaly,

Speaker 1:          01:26:51       yeah, I mean even like simple things like tell yourself you're going to do an hour and a half on an elliptical machine. What seems real easy for five minutes and then 10 minutes and you're like, fuck, I got an hour and 20 more minutes this bullshit. And then you know as you're going and not reduce the level, keep the level at the same. And just force yourself to do it. That's not easy to do, but that ain't shit compared to an ultra marathon. So there's levels to everything. And then how about these crazy fucks that do like there's people that do to ultra marathons in a row, like they'll do an ultra marathon and they'll do an ultra marathon back because a regular ultra marathon is not fucking crazy enough for these people because they did want to find the edge. What? When's the edge? Or I hit it. Nope, I think I can go further. I think I'm building up more endurance. I think I'm building the goal more mental toughness. I can go further. Have you ever heard of Wynn Hoff? I've heard that. What does the iceman? Yes. That crazy.

Speaker 2:          01:27:49       That good. Ran a marathon in the, uh, in the desert without drinking water. Yeah. He goes and does his crease craziest immersions and, and like freezing temperatures and he can keep his core temperature without changing. He holds the world record like two hours. So he's saying that he's come up with a method that he can teach you how to change your physiology to be able to adapt to these things. And it's with breathing techniques, um, commitment and a cold water immersion. Wim Hoff. Fucking alien. That guy, Hey, I did is uh, I bought his thing the other day and me and becky did the breathing thing. Um, my wife and the first day I did it, I hold my breath for two minutes and 41 seconds. My wife held it for two minutes and 30 seconds after, after 15 minutes doing this breathing stuff. And you held it for five minutes before we. Because that guy is somebody who is a 41 second. Yeah. In short. In short shorts and no shirt. Yeah. Summited everest. Yeah. It took 26 people up to Kilimanjaro. Uh, they submitted it and they all had a cancers or ailments or whatever, trained them for three months. 16 of them submitted. They did it in 20, 36 hours and they did it in shorts. You know what I mean? His whole thing is I can train you to take, take over your and

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       your autonomic nervous system. Well, a guy like that seeing, you know, like people talk about mental training, like cowboy cerrone on the other day and uh, I asked him if he's involved in, you know, he's talking about like Mindfox and things that go wrong and fights. I'm like, have you ever done any mentor training at all? And he's like never fucked with any of that stuff, but I think you get a guy who was as tough as like a cowboy cerrone and you teach him some shit like this. Absolutely. It's all next level. This is the elite of the elite. You know what I mean? So if you can get your physical, your physical performance up to the top level, then you're selling yourself short. If you're not only also having a mental aspect to your game, you have to have a mental aspect to your game.

Speaker 1:          01:29:40       You have to be mentally draining. I think also like people get used to shit, you get used to stuff and you get used to stuff like where it's not that bad anymore. Like, you know, I do this. Have you done the Cryo therapy yet? Have you done any of that? No. What are you doing after this? You want to go do it? Two hundred 70 degrees below zero for three minutes. Fucking awesome. My mom did it. She says amazing. Amazing. You get out of there, you feel like a fucking Werewolf, like you're going to run through buildings. Oh, sign. So the point is though, like I do it so often it's nothing but the first time I did I was like, Oh shit, now I do it. I just stand there. Like I literally like the timer goes off at three minutes online. I can keep going.

Speaker 1:          01:30:19       I could just keep going. My body body's so. It's so normal to me. I get used to it. I wonder if that's what's going on with his wind Hoff guy too. It's like his mind has a category for these states and he puts himself in these antique and slowly but surely increase the duration of these states and the suffering and the in his body understands how to mitigate whatever issues might come up from. It's got a documentary on Vice Joe, check it out. It's like 39 slash 40 minutes. I keep hearing about it. I and I haven't looked into it enough. I want to read the facts machine I bought. I bought the programs like a 10 week program for 200 bucks. I was like, I'm getting it. That's awesome. I want to do that. Yeah, I need to get that guy in here. Those people that are like that, those outliers, those are real outliers.

Speaker 1:          01:30:59       So it's people that like, like I said, when you talk about doing an ultra marathon or something along those lines, like for most people like God, that's the develop mental toughness is involved in that is insane. And then you hear about this guy and roller bolt, fuck. Well there's always going to be someone who's taking it to the next place. Next Guy's going to do it fucking barefoot, you know? I mean it's just, he's cool because he, he hooks up with scientists and they regulate everything. They take the blood before and during, after he's looked up to the machine. So he's like, he can prove now it's, you know, it's proven evidence proven that what he's doing, you know, that's, that's really cool about it. That's from being different. Some like some religious cuc or whatever to hey this is how I'm doing it, this is why this time effecting my autonomic nervous system and now I got the science to back it up. Right. So a lot of people, they look at that and they think of it as like walking on coals, which is really just kind of a horseshit trick. You just walk fast and it gets fucked up, but you're fine, you know. Whereas this guy, I love that too, that he has brought in scientists to make sure, like there's zero fuckery involved here. This is a guy that really understands how to regulate his body temperature and his breathing and no, no

Speaker 2:          01:32:06       false hope and. But that's exactly what we're doing with Dr Gordon and the foundation. Hey, there's no false hope here. You know what I mean? So what he's doing, when I love about him, he was like, hey, no false hope. What we're putting out to the guys out here, if you're listening, there's no false hope and Dr Gordon's program and through the were angels foundation, it's all science evidence based and we've set up a system that's so advanced that you don't even have to go to a doctor's office, be able to see Dr Gordon. Everything is paperless, done through skype. So we've got personalized individualized, uh, methods for medicine to see one of the world's most renowned people to treat traumatic brain injuries. We're now bringing that to every veteran that signs up through our program. Did you brought the whole thing full circle?

Speaker 1:          01:32:47       Okay. Did that fucking. You've been doing media do it. You know how to bring it back. Now I'm the Warrior Angels Foundation. What does anybody have to do if they want to get involved in this? Like say someone's listening to this and they say, you know, they're thinking themselves. This, this applies to me, right? Like, I know, I know this could help me. I know I have this issue. All you gotta to do is go to our website, go to our treatment page and start filling in your information. And the website is warrior Angel Foundation. We are angels with the angels, Angels Foundation Dot Org.

Speaker 2:          01:33:16       So you go through, you fill out your initial information, then you get started in our automated process. What you'll get Dr [inaudible], Dr Gordon's a patient patient intake form, you know the, the long one and you'll fill that out, get it back to us through email, never had to print out anything, no printing, no nothing, man. It's all digitalized, uh, all done through the cloud. So we get all that information. Once we get all your information in, Dr Gordon in his office, check it. They make sure you're a good candidate. Once that's been decided, we'll go ahead and we'll start with funding you. And um, when we make the funds go through, you'll get your blood test, we'll send a. We have access labs and Florida. All right, so they'll do your labs. So they send the labs to you, to you wherever you're at, and they will make plans for you to go to a lab that's the closest to your geographical location.

Speaker 2:          01:34:03       So that's the only time you're gonna have to leave your house to do this thing. So you'll go, you'll go to leave your house to go get your labs drawn. They'll ticket, they'll take the labs, they'll send that back to Florida, Florida. We'll get it there, analyze the results they're seeing the results to Dr Gordon. Dr Gordon gets it, he gets the results, makes a, a, a, uh, they schedule an appointment with you to do a one on one consultation and he'll go over everything in complete detail and answer all your questions there and then go over what your protocols, what do thinks your protocol should be before we actually do a skype, I write a four page report which gets sent by email to the patient and it has English in it, not just medical leaves in an explains some of the results and it gives them a chart of what the suggested first group of products or the first approach will be. And then through Fedex we send a very comprehensive patient that's a put together

Speaker 3:          01:34:58       specifically based upon their lab results. It's about 80 pages in total and explains why we did every single one of the tests and how they interpret out and then supportive documentation from the general medical literature that's out there. Um, and then through the skype, which is 45 minutes to an hour, we go through every single one of the lab tests and how it pertains to them after we discuss their traumas or whatever their accident that they had or if they're a civilian in the lack of any accident. But here's what your results are. And then we make arrangements for either their doctor to participate with us or one of our doctors, you know, since November twelfth when I saw you last year, um, my new book on traumatic brain injury came out and I'm a new lecture series came out and we did that in San Diego. And part of the reason why there are now more doctors aware of what we, what we do is because we trained 45 docs from five different countries in the protocols that we've developed over the past 10 years.

Speaker 3:          01:36:00       And the results we had. Andrew was there and spoke to them. We had a night of Friday night, which was for military night since we were so close to coordinate island and invited the military. Anyone active war. Presently I'm a veteran to come to the meeting and to hear Andrew talk about his own life's experience. You know, I can be the egg head and tell you about the science that's behind it, but what's really impacting on both the psychological, emotional level is listening to someone as you did to Matthew Gazani when he was on the show and Andrew telling his story of how he transitioned from this phenomenal life to this great military life, that then the injuries and then what happened after it and then having all these standardized medical procedures done, which really didn't help to bring them to the level that he's at right now, which is according to his mother, father, sister, brother. Your dog also said that you were acting much better than you were in the past ever. Right, and his life is transition. The emails he sends me about the quality that he's experienced, that's what it's about. Regardless of what we do, it's always about, unfortunately the end point of the journey that we're taking right now is that bringing you back to a functionality where you're enjoying life. How's your life?

Speaker 1:          01:37:16       Yeah. Couldn't be any better, I couldn't be any better. And, and that's what we're, that's what we're saying. Hey, we want to bring this to everybody out there who's been told, like I was told, this is the new you take a notebook around with you because you're gonna have to write stuff down because you're not going to be able to remember it. And here's an important thing. There's a donate link and the donate link at a warrior, Angels Foundation Dot Org. The donate link is really important because there's a lot of guys that just didn't have the funds. They don't have funds for this kind of treatment. And it's not covered by insurance companies. Correct. I mean, there's any insurance covering this all.

Speaker 3:          01:37:48       What happened? Um, let's see how Matthew Gosney got in as I take a, a, a, of my practice and put it into a separate fund. And that's how I think, uh, uh, started funding the military is through our practice because it's, you know, for a year, the first year it's $5,000 all inclusive. Everything. Because we've gotten donations from our laboratory, the laboratory that we use, access medical lab has given us a lot of money to help offset the costs for the labs are compounding pharmacy university. Compounding pharmacy gave us $100,000 grant so that testosterone is for free. Any of the compounded products free. Another pharmacy pharmacy gives us all our clomid so that the first three months of product for the, the less than 40 year old veterans, they get clomid, which helps stimulate their own body to make testosterone. We just got a $10,000 grant from a pure encapsulations for the key antioxidants that we use for brain health and a lot of help streamlining those costs coming in and get this joe the 5,000 in year one is compared to what the va spins, which is $15,000 and the Congressional Budget Office report in 2012 for Tbi and PTSD, 15 to $16,000 to treat that and all they use is medication and psychotherapy.

Speaker 3:          01:39:15       So it gets more as the years goes on. Whereas we're fixing an underlying condition. We're fixing the problem, $5,000 for the first year, about 3,500, 2,535 the second year, and then every year thereafter the cost is about $1,500. The same cop was, it had a $66 billion dollars is what they're paying for all the medical care in 2012 slash $66,000,000,000. That's why we're getting listened to because we're were like, look at the difference and variations of these prices of what you guys are spending and result and the end, the end result don't. But nobody cared about the end result. They cared about numbers from that crazy. Yeah. And let me just tell anybody who's listening. If I made. My daughter has a jewelry company and she's volunteered to, um, to gift to anyone who gives $5,000 a coin, which is a 1800 years of age silver coin from a roam.

Speaker 3:          01:40:13       All authentic. They look brand new coins, um, as a gift. Anyone who helps us with $5,000, uh, Eric coins or era, if I can say her website. Sure. Okay. It's e R A, B Y R, g.com, and on there you'll see giving, it actually shows what she's a producing in her jewelry company and donating to a warrior angels foundation so they can hand it out to people who are donating money. Now, is there any resistance to this, this type of training? Is there a, are there any detractors, a training insensitive over the seven training treatment rather? Uh, no. Um, in fact, um, everything is FDA approved. Everything is being used at physiological levels. I think I shared with you on past show that we use a blended testosterone, a injectable that we developed about 14 years ago, which gets into the brain a lot faster than the cip yonatan the Atlantic that's out there, different types of testosterone and we use a very low dose, 40 milligrams, which is the amount that a healthy 25 to 35 year old makes in a week's time.

Speaker 3:          01:41:27       So we're using everything physiologic and it's not just about hormone replenishment, it's about the micronutrients that we're using to help with the hormone so that they work. I mean, you need to have a well balanced machinery in the brain in order to get all the benefits and you, no one is addressing the inflammatory aspect to brain trauma and without addressing that, you can't get improvement. Now I know there's sustained improvement that they're developing new testosterone that's animal based. Instead of using yams, the, they're using animals somehow or another, and they're avoiding detection with, uh, uh, these, uh, drug testing when they're doing these, um, carbon isotope tests, right? This is new. This is the new thing that, that, uh, the, the people on the fringe of the cheating movement. Yeah. Well, if you can get the testosterone more so into the brain because we're just testosterone from really work.

Speaker 3:          01:42:21       Yeah, it does work to help build muscle, but what controls the muscle? The brain. We were just talking about how people succeed in freezing and Eisman and Kilimanjaro. It's all the brain. So if you can increase the brain's ability to be resistant to failure, meaning that you've got a mindset, you're going to do it regardless of hell or high water, you're going to do it. That's really where the benefits are, so the testosterone increases those benefits. Correct, and low dose, a very well absorbed, both like two stops from appropriate, gets into the system, into the cells and three to four hours and it's out of the blood so you don't detect it appropriate. What about that? You were. You developed drops. Little light bulbs. SOMOS Nana live too. So mit's a compounded product. We developed the vehicle that the compounding pharmacies can legal legally put testosterone into this liquid and the liquid is put under.

Speaker 3:          01:43:18       The tongue was put into the mouth and washed around and gets absorbed because the particle size is so small, it gets absorbed rapidly, but there's a different world. This is something you have to do every day, right? This is one that, yeah, our testing showed that either once a day, ideally once a day is the best, but uh, you get to regulate the responsiveness that you have the response. So if you want to have a nice easy day, take one squirt on the tongue. If you want to have really energetic day, you'd take two. If you want to have a fun night for many hours, you take four. That

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       sounds like you're encouraging people to get fucking crazy. I educate everybody. It's prescription only. And with all the great doctors out there, they'll regulate it and it, and it's not, it's not a magic pill, but what it'll do is it'll allow you to live life the way it was intended to be. You know what I mean? So before, if you couldn't react to something, now you'll be able to react to things appropriately. You'll be able to do things appropriately towards. If you're, if you're have a, your neurochemistry is not in balance, then you can't. So this will give you the opportunity to do that.

Speaker 1:          01:44:26       So in closing, is there anything else you guys want to say? Warrior Angels Foundation Dot Org is where you can go to learn more about this. We got it

Speaker 2:          01:44:35       crowdfunding campaign that you can get to through our website. Um, we got awesome perks on there, like a range day with me shooting at the range. You got videos on there for that. I'm cool mugs or whatever. So some incentives to give. And uh, and anything you want to find out about Dr Gordon or also his daughter will be on our website as well.

Speaker 3:          01:44:54       I will say that a life extension magazine that in 2012 did the article on hormones to heal the brain in the military is doing a followup, a followup article where they've gone to six or eight of our patients for I think military and two are for non nonmilitary and interviewed them to get their experience over the past few years that, uh, since the 2012 article. And I think it'll be important for those people who are thinking about maybe getting involved in what we're doing to read that. I think it's coming out a the end of the year to read it and listen to the experience. Where else go back to the, uh, Matthew Gazani Jason Hall, November Twelfth of last year. And listen to the podcast that was done because I get a lot of calls of how many people exactly what he said was what I'm going through. And I think listening to those that are injured and get onto the program more important than anything I can say.

Speaker 2:          01:45:52       And also Joe, because we're on here today, lives will be changed, man. I, it's probably hard to comprehend that, but thank you for this opportunity because it's going to have a ripple effect that you probably aren't gonna be able to understand, but my being on here, things were things that were going to affect people's lives in a positive, positive way.

Speaker 1:          01:46:09       That's you. That's what I hope. And thank you. Thank you for starting this foundation. Thank you for being so active with it. Dark Dot Gordon. I mean this is all amazing stuff and whenever you hear about people getting help like this and how effective it is, it's just a beautiful thing is really awesome. All right folks, so warrior angels, Foundation Dot Org. Go there, check out the crowd, fund a link, check out the donate button and become a part of this folks, you can help. All right, thank you everybody. That's it for this week. We'll see you soon. Bye. Bye. Thanks.
