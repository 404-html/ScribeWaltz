Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Who did you do to? To another episode of the Richard Jeni Fan club? He's. He's a guy that I've been telling forever is probably the most underrated standup in the history of standup. I think he's one of the all time greats. Henry's got a body of work because he did a one hour back before everybody was doing one hour specials every year. He was doing that shit back in the nineties. Oh yeah, on showtime. Like when I was just starting out, so I think it was like 89 or 90 somewhere around the one. He had a showtime special. Yeah. And then he had a male. Yep. He had a bunch of hbo specials, but the last one that he did before he died in 2007. That is his masterpiece. Yeah. It's called a steaming pile of me and I was listening to it one night coming home from a club and just laughing out loud in the car and clapping, clapping, and I'm like, God damn. This guy was good.

Speaker 2:          00:00:57       Yeah. What a good. I mean he was one of those guys that dressed. He put on a sharp outfit, pleated pants, you know, really fucking Corny, like nineties looking, you know, call it the collar with the rounded priest collared shirts.

Speaker 1:          00:01:12       Well he was from Bensonhurst. Oh, is that right? Yeah, yeah. It's the old school mentality from Brooklyn. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       And he would, uh, he would give you lot. I can remember like at least three times. He would call me an hour after my set and give me taglines to bits. Wow. Yeah. And they were fucking good. He was almost like on the spectrum with the. Yeah, totally. He wouldn't look you in the eye. He'd be like looking down and go really fast and talk with his hands. And uh, and he, I think he obviously, if people don't know Richard, Jeni sadly committed suicide in the end. And what was tough for him was that he was that good and he never really broke through. He had a sitcom short lifts Sitcom called platypus. Man. That was on like one of those a upn eventually. And after that it was like he was the guy who used to fill up his book in January, you know, he was, he was on the road 45 weeks a year and you know, making 100 grand on corporate dates, 50 grand on corporate dates with, you know, 15 of those a year.

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Yeah. I'm sure he was living well but, but he felt like a failure. Yeah. And to us he was a hero. Yeah. Like I remember seeing him in east side Comedy Club in New York and um, it was me and Joey Cola and a couple other guys. I only saw one set, but um, God, I forget who the host was, but the host said he did didn't. Different hour all four shows. Shit, what? I was so humbled because I was like, I don't even have. I had 20 minutes back then it was like, what, how did he do that? How can you do that? And they were like, he's the best. He's a. But it was a weird thing. It's like

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       he came along before Netflix because if he was around today and people got to see his netflix special. Yeah. It's just one of those things that would have caught on. Right. But in the hbo specials, you either home when it aired or you weren't, you know, there was no dvrs back then. Maybe maybe set up the vhs tape to record maybe. Yeah. I could never figure out how to fucking get that thing to record when I wasn't there.

Speaker 2:          00:03:26       Oh No. I could tell them now the time or you, you'd end up recording like days of our lives or something and golden girls, potential twats being written. There's a bunch of old women in the scripts are written by old Jewish guys. Oh, you know, I just saw menopause joke.

Speaker 3:          00:03:43       He said one of the saddest cases to me because I just don't think that. I don't know like how many friends he had, like in comedy. I know he's really good friends with Chris Rock and he worked with Chris a lot. Like he was like a punch up guy for Chris a lot, but I don't, I don't, you know, I don't know if anybody was there to just be as. I think that's a big thing for us because we're so like, I think comics are some of the weirdest fucking people. Yeah. But I gravitate towards them. Like I've always said if I run into a comic at the airport, I'm like, oh look, it's one of us, you know. It's just weird. It's a weird job where weird people were all crazy. I've never met one of us that isn't crazy. And I think sometimes we need each other to go. Yeah. It's all right. You're right. Everybody loves you, man.

Speaker 2:          00:04:31       Like, yeah, going to the comedy store for me is definitely like a therapy session I feel. And it's partly, it's that you're performing and you're getting the positive feedback and part of it is that you're running into people. And I mean it could be anybody, it could be a, an Asian female comic, it could be fat, can be Don Barris, like the spectrum of different types. But like you said, there's something that, there's a thread that runs through all of it, which is like this, this feeling that like mma, we're going to get in the ring. We are, we are going to face an audience at some point that night and there's a charge to that. Like there's a fear. I don't care who the fuck you are. You can deny you're afraid when you go on stage every but it's in there somewhere. We've just gotten so good at dealing with it that it doesn't show and sometimes we're not even aware of it.

Speaker 3:          00:05:19       And if it's not there, that means you're probably not taking any chances. Right. That's not good. Then you'll have that doll thing going on stage and then you'll bomb. And then you'll really have fear when you're doing jokes that you think are killer and they've just eaten plates a ship up there because you don't have anything left in you. Yeah. Like last night, it's just murderer's row man. I'm walking in and fucking Bobby Lee's crushing and then Chris Delea is crushing and then I go up and Thiel, vons crushing, and then it's fucking Ian Edwards smash. And that's like, yeah, good Lord with a lineup and you're hugging everybody. I'm hugging barris. I see him a hug Whitney Cummings. I see how

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       everybody's just like. It's just this big comradery place. Yeah. We're so lucky

Speaker 2:          00:06:04       here. We survived. You know, and there's so many guys that I came up, you know, we came up with guys that I would have. I was competitive when I started out and these guys I had bad blood with and I see this guys now and they're like my brothers because we went through it together.

Speaker 1:          00:06:19       Yeah, I know the competitive thing. I've talked about that. Like I had to give that up. I had that when I was a kid when I was 21 ish because it was still leftover from the martial arts days, martial arts competition. Then like I would want people to do bad and then I realized that God is so stupid, like that has zero effect on me. Like when they're up there, if they're doing good, that'll just make me better. It would just make me work harder. Yeah. But if they do bad, like I was like that's the thing that some comedians do. They will take a terrible comment on the road with them so they can look like a hero. It's a common thing, right? It's called stacking the deck. Look, they'll stack the deck. They'll have like just some torturous act for half an hour and then they go up and look like a monster. Yeah. And that's not the way to do it, I don't think. I think the way to do is the opposite. Just have a bunch of murderers on in front of you and have fun with it. Yeah. And everybody have fun. Yeah. I think that you.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       I love, I mean there's, I don't like going on you layer. There's like one or two guys that I just don't like going on after and, and, but in general, why don't you like going on after deleted? I just feel like he's so physical and big and that doesn't really. It shouldn't affect me, but I just feel like when he gets off the crowd is just like in this mode of like euphoria and it's Kinda like, all right, I'm going to, I'm going to take it down a couple notches and just talk. And I feel like sometimes that's my weakness that I can adjust to that. Joey Diaz, same thing. Oh, it's just like the room is just, they got to put their socks back on and you're up there and I, and I'm writing dry shit. I'm trying to be a little ironic and they're just looking at me like, you're small, you're insignificant. You're, you know, in all your insecurity. Start coming out sometimes. And I've beaten that like you, you come up in New York and you can't be like that because you go on after a towel and Louis and whoever. And so I came to terms with, with trying to realizing that you don't ride the wave, you let the wave settle and you start your own way. And, and I would make that mistake early on is I'd come up then and I jack up my energy and I, and it wasn't me and then it would falter.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       Yeah, that is, that is true. You have to bring the audience to you. Yeah. Yeah. And of the best place to learn how to do that as the Olr right now because first of all, you really, you only have 15 minutes and there's all these other guys that have 15 minutes to and they go on these rides. So everybody's going on a new ride, like, okay, just got done with magic

Speaker 4:          00:08:56       mountain or space mountain. Now we're going to go on this ride. And it's a small world. Oh, small world. Slower. He settled down. It's not as crazy. We're all the lights. You got to settle in. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great fucking place for just just figuring it out and working on your shit. I'm in this weird place right now with my act where I'm getting ready to film a special. I'm hyper examining. Yeah, everything going over everything with a fine tooth comb. But the problem with that is you go over everything too much and then it starts getting real blurry looking at what is this? Yeah. And you start landing. I find that I start landing on the punchlines too hard instead of talking it out instead of like being like the more ideal at the more. I know, all right, this is where they laugh and I sort of.

Speaker 4:          00:09:45       And there's sort of lucky I stick it too much instead of flowing. And so when, when you do the special, it's almost like you got to take, take a little time off before you do it. There's a number of sets you do where you're, you're in the groove and it's tight and everything feels good. And then there's a number that you do too much and everything gets kind of flat. Yeah. You've got to find that right. What is that? No one, if they have that, another thing. So like if that's a must be the case with bands right when they toured, they must get so sick of fucking singing the same song over and over and over and over again. I mean, I saw the beach boys recently and uh, they fucking love it. They love being up there, you know, you can see it, you can feel it, you know, I think it goes to another level.

Speaker 4:          00:10:28       I think it becomes a communication with the fans, with bands that we don't necessarily have the same thing. It's like for them areas, a very communal experience that's happening. And with us it's more like, we're going to dominate you for an hour. Right? We're going to take control of this room. You're going to listen to everything we say. We're going to bring you up, take you down. It's salt, you bring you back in. You know, crowd worked is like a whole thing, but it's all being orchestrated by you. Yeah. Yeah. Another thing we were talking about about traveling to places like the further you go, the harder it is to get there, the more happy they are. Right? That's a, that's an interesting phenomenon. Like if you could do, like I was saying that Ari and I did a Gig in Anchorage, Alaska a few years back. Fucking amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:11:14       Yeah. Get up there and this weird town, you know, and the coolest fucking people. There've been anchorage now, Dude. Crazy. We've got up there and uh, I'm expecting, I'm going to see people covering for and everything's going to be covered in snow and the rod dog sleds everywhere and shit that they were so normal, uh, drove by this group of people holding up signs. Said Honk for diversity. Have Nosha like they're holding rainbow flags up and shit. Do they have diversity? Yeah. No Shit. Yeah. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's a real city. I mean, it's small. Yeah. How many people you think live in Anchorage? If you had to? 20,000.

Speaker 4:          00:11:57       I'm going to go with 50, 50 people. Yeah. No, 50,000. 300,000. 300,000. No Shit. Wow. Shit. That's huge. Yeah. That's three times the size of boulder. That's really big houses in Juneau. I remember I was in Juno and there was a burger king and I was like, what the fuck is a burger king doing in the middle of Alaska? And then they were bald eagles going through the dumpster and picking a fucking big MACs is a symbol of America right here. That's the first time I've ever seen that. You go live. Was it Alaska? There's a weird animal look at. I know it's a weird animal to pick for your bird to like start national animal. Yeah. Ruthless fucking evil raptor. Yeah. That comes out of the sky at a nowhere kills. Oh yeah. You know, they say that there was an eagle at one point in time that they think was preying on early humans.

Speaker 4:          00:12:55       No Shit. No. They think that there's been some giant raptors in the past and they found some old primate bones, some old ancient ancestors of human beings that had what looked like claw marks on their skulls. Their brains had been picked out of their skull and caught out. Yeah. There was an eagle like that and it's New Zealand was called the Haast Eagle was an enormous ego in New Zealand, like way bigger than any of the eagles that we have alive today. I think it might have jack to few people. Wow. Well, Colorado, I'm sure when you lived out there people you can't leave your dog outside. No, my dog had eaten there now. No Shit. Yeah, I had a bit about it in my act. No Shit. My little dog. What kind of dog was it? He was, um, a Pomeranian American eskimo mix. That's a decent sized dog that he was real little.

Speaker 4:          00:13:45       He was like this big. It was like maybe 30 pounds. Tiny little guy. Yeah, he got Jack. Did you see him get ya know? But we saw the cat hanging around the property. We saw the cat in the area and then there was, there was definitely evidence that something had gone down. Yeah, no, fuck yeah, it happens all the time. One of the things that they found in California is because California has a lot of mountain lions that live on the outskirts of cities. They purposely hanging around the outskirts of cities and come into town at night and eat people's dogs and cats and they found that when they examined the contents, they expected it to be way more like rabbits and deer and shit like that. But it was half domestic house cats and dogs. Yeah. Half of their diet because they're easy. The fatted calf. Well also they can just jump over everything. I mean, any fence, you have that group over it, grab your dog and they're so powerful they can take your dog over the top of the fence. Right? Fucking nuts. Shit. No. I came home one day and there was a possum in the driveway. And the Cro, you know, fucking.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Are they ravens? Are Crows in la? Those giant black birds. That's a good question. I don't know what the differences, because I said they were crows and my friend's like, no, those are ravens and they're, they're big. I mean there are good two feet long and it was on top of a possum and it was fucking picking it apart. And the thing was alive. The possum was alive. Yeah. Really? And so I, uh, so I tried to scare this, this a blackbird away and he looked at me like I'm not going anywhere. I got to fucking possum here. And so I got a broom and I like pushed him away. He took off. Yeah, he let you get that close. You could touch. Oh yeah, he wasn't leaving the possum. Whoa. And then he, uh, he stood like 12 feet away and I got a shoe box and I put the PA submitted.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       But the possums, they hiss at you, they open their mouths, they just go like this and they got vicious teeth. You've got to be really careful with them. But I got it in the shoe box and I called animal services and they came and got it. We'll get you out there saving. That's right. I love possums. Do you think for them? Yeah, they're cute as shit. I love him and they just so mysterious. You know, they come out at night and like where are they hiding them? The day one of them used to sleep and I had some shrubs on the side of my lawn and it was, you could, if you looked inside, you could see him hanging upside down.

Speaker 1:          00:16:07       Yeah. Oh, that's right. They hang. Yeah. What a fucked up animal I now, have you ever seen a quad a Monday? Never even heard of it. A quad a Monday is a an animal that's in South America and a friend of mine was telling me he ran into one or I was listening to his podcast. Rather he ran into one of them in Arizona and that it looks like a bear fucked a monkey and it looks like half bear, half mcgee. Leave that thing. No Shit. Cool thing and it's a climber, dad, dude. Well they're big. They're like 40 pounds and they're predatory and he was making noises. He was deer hunting and this thing came running out of the woods. He was trying to call it by making like a wounded animal. Sounds like this thing. I can't run it out of the out of the grass looking at him. Look at that thing. We just fucking crazy little animal go wolverine. I didn't even know that existed. I had no idea that thing existed. I mean it does look like it's a member of the Badger family and look at its face, but then it has a tail, like a big crazy long tail

Speaker 2:          00:17:17       teeth look like a, like a rang of tank teeth. The way they curve in like sharp,

Speaker 1:          00:17:22       I didn't even know that was a real thing. Apparently it's, there's a lot of them in South America and then in the United States they are expanding their range in Arizona. Wow. Yeah. The way you spell it is c o a t I m u n d I, quantum Monday. Isn't that a Spanish speaking channel? It was actually coming up like that. Kuda Monday. Oh, interesting. Yeah. But people spell it with a C in America. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       I went with the phonetic spelling, that type of thing actually with Acu. And this is what came up was the key. Interesting. A, um, I think what, uh, what, how is it spelled in another one if you scrolled down that one we just looked at it. I think you spelled with a c. yeah, I think that's how you spell it. Cla. Yeah, whatever. It's awesome. And people apparently the game and fish department in Arizona, they get calls all the time where people like there's a monkey running around in the woods. I saw a monkey, but it's that thing that, that could just be a racist. Call it Arizona is this weird place. Arizona is a incredibly interesting and its climate, right? Like you've got desert and then you have like some of the craziest forest. You have all kinds of weird shit. They're like, oh, incredibly diverse wildlife population in Arizona.

Speaker 4:          00:18:42       Yeah, right. They gas birds, birds and deer and elk and all kinds of weird shit. Crazy. Like you're in the middle of Phoenix and you got this fucking giant cliffs sticking right up in the middle of the city. Great hiking. I did that one time there. They have an influx of Jaguars now. Oh, there's a quantum Monday wars. Yes. They're moving in from Mexico. Look at that fucker. Things says they make good pets too, apparently. Really as you can train them. Whoa. Hold those fucking teeth. At first. I'm pretty sure we saw one of those in Costa Rica and my daughters were calling it a Kinkajou. They made up a name for it, but he was just hanging out near this resort in Costa Rico. Yeah. Look, it is a little fuckers just chilling. They got long tongues, so are there any editors too? I bet. I bet they fucking eat everything.

Speaker 4:          00:19:33       Yeah, I mean it's hard out there. Look at him. Just know. Oh my God. The guy's patting it. That is crazy. These are wild. Oh, okay. That's a resort. See, that's Kinda like what I experienced in Costa Rica. These things would just combine. Hang out. What a cool looking fucking animal that guys belly did not yet as in front of A. Yeah. South America. It's, it's crazy how like if you've gone to south, have you ever gone to South America now? Oh yeah. Chili, the wildlife there. It's just incredible. Costa Rica has all these different kinds of Costa Rica. They have howler monkeys. Right? Those other small. Yeah. We had a howler monkeys. Right? It was like a one because it's the rain forest and we had a one mile like path that went around the house that we're renting and yet these howler monkeys would go right above. You scream. No fear. It was fucking dogs everywhere. We had like two dogs that just work. They must have come with the house. They were just there and you feed them and they follow you everywhere. Oh Wow. And then you drive up and there's a, the black river, I think it's called and it's right on the border of Nicaragua and uh, they've

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       got those Caymans, you know, this little alligators and you take a boat through these like waterways and I mean it is filthy with came and they're fucking everywhere. Wow. It was so scary. And we were, we were just like

Speaker 4:          00:21:01       paddle. And through them they have real crocodiles in Costa Rica, they have those big ass crocodiles. We would do that. Yeah. We went on a tour and they take on a boat and they take you like pretty close to these things. But I'm freaking the fuck out. I'm like, one of my kids falls overboard. They're dead. Right. And you're just on this little boat, you know? And these, these people are so relaxed about like safety and she isn't so not Disneyland. You Go. Did you go to the middle part? Like Lake rnl with went to a couple of different spots, but we went up to the rain forest and did the zip line, which is a mile long. And I'm like, Ooh, fuck is checking this. Who's making sure that this is the stability of this line is intact.

Speaker 2:          00:21:41       All right? And then they had this, they have this volcano that's in, um, I forget they will. Lake Lake area is the area and they've got these, uh, this hot springs and there was like 14 pools that went up a hill and you could, you could swim in each one. And the bottom was like cold and the top one was so hot, it was practically boiling so you could just kind of work your way up into each one. And then, uh, and then these, uh, you know, this woman comes up to me and she goes, you want a massage? And I was like, yeah. So we go out to this little, like a, it's off to the side and there's like a little their sheets around a bed and I'm laying there and I'm like, this is fucking great, you know. And then all of a sudden I hear my mother's voice and she had gotten solicit and she was getting a massage like six inches from me. And I'm stark naked getting rubbed by this beautiful Costa Rican woman. And I could hear my mother who doesn't stop talking for the entire.

Speaker 4:          00:22:40       They're thick bronx accent. So how long you been here for you from here? That's a relaxation crusher. Yes. We just want to just melt into the rain forest and rubbed on down through that little horseshoe with your face in it and look at those little Costa Rican feet. Brown rounded little toes. Oh, that's so weird. Massages are fucking weird, man. Yeah, it's weird. I mean it's obviously there's, there's a physical aspect to it, like you want your muscles to be manipulated because it's very good for them and you get loose some kinks in a lot of like weird stuff that's not adopt. But there's also the pleasure aspect of it's pleasurable, right? Like it feels good to have someone touch you.

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       Oh my God. I mean your skin is your biggest organ. And they talk about emotionally and psychically what it means to have skin to skin contact. And for an hour somebody is devoting their skin to your skin. I mean, think about you have sex with your wife. You're touching for, you know, 15, 20 minutes. One part of you little groping you cry,

Speaker 1:          00:23:55       but to have a sensual touch like that know for an hour. Yeah, and also like the energy that you must get. Like when you're a person who's doing that all day, like you're putting out a lot of energy, you're getting energy from those people. Like some people must feel weird.

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       Yeah, I've talked. I've talked to who say that they have to discharge energy after a massage. They do in. These are more like touchy feely kind of misuses. Quinsy told people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That one that she, she would put crystals in my belly button. Oh. And then my arm would be down and she would hold my arm and tell me to raise my arm to see what the pressure was and then she could tell by that which herbal remedies I needed for my allergies,

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       Jesus Christ, to so many of these people out so fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:24:52       And then it works. And you're like, what the fuck it worked. I guess you can believe anything. How did it work? I, she gave me allergies. So these herbs, because I was like, just fucking sneezing nonstop and I stop sneezing and you know what that, that, um, that would he homeopath, they take like a barrel of distilled water and then they'll put in like a mint leaf and like a couple other herbs and then they just take the bottle and they fill it with that water and that's, that's homeopathic remedy. Most of them are like that. Did that diluted?

Speaker 1:          00:25:28       Yeah. A lot of it's bullshit. Like I remember somebody gave me Arnica once. What's that? It's like some little little pills. They're little tiny, tiny little, almost little little things that dissolve in your mouth. Oh yeah, right. It's like sugar, right? I go, this is sugar. And someone's like, Nah, the sugar in it. I go, well, why is there sugar in it? It's supposed to be medicine. Sugar's not good for you. What the fuck is this? And it was homeopathic or some sort of homeopathic remedy. I'm like, okay, do I have to believe this stuff works for it to work? Because one of those things, because that's a real thing, right? You know? Well, what do you say to people who don't think that vitamins are helpful? Well, that's silly. There's a lot of studies that show the vitamins are healthy. What does a lot of studies that say they're not?

Speaker 1:          00:26:10       Yeah, not really. I mean too much. Vitamins was excessive. Vitamins doesn't make any sense, but the studies that show that vitamins are beneficial. They're pretty specific. There's pretty specific in terms of like if you get your blood work done, right. For instance, and you are short a lot of people short of vitamin D dot vitamin D is a big one. Vitamin B is also a big one. Bb Twelve, which is the one you get from the sun, that's d two. D three is a good one too and that one's good for muscle development and a lot of other functions. There's a lot of shit that vitamins are good for. Fish oil is fantastic. It's very good for reducing inflammation. There's a lot of supplements that are 100 percent legit, but there's a lot of doctors that don't know anything about nutrition and it'll tell you all you need is a balanced meal, a balanced meal.

Speaker 1:          00:27:02       Well, if you had a balanced meal, kind of, yeah, if you really made sure that you ate a certain portion of vegetables, green leafy dark vegetables that have a lot of vitamins, and if you made sure that you have the right amount of protein and fruit. Yeah, fruit, some, some fruit. You're not a proponent of eating too much fruit or identity. Tell me like a sugar in it. Like juices. Most juices are too high in sugar. If you drink a big glass of orange juice, your body has a really hard time differentiating that between a big glass of soda or fucking high c or some shit like that. It's like if it has 30 grams of sugar, it has 30 grams of sugar and that's what it is. It's 30 grams of sugar. The fact that it's coming out of an orange, that's great, but you're not supposed to drink it like that and the orange is supposed to be something you eat when you eat it.

Speaker 1:          00:27:47       You get all the fiber, your body breaks it down slower. You're just getting this fucking mainline a sugar right into your system. I drink a glass or like if I go and I have breakfast with a big glass of orange juice, I fucking crashed. Hard like an hour later. Yeah, it's a little insulin dump. Well, they just did it. I just read yesterday that there's this study now that losing weight is not about caloric intake. It's all about sugar and processed foods. Crazy. Yeah. No. Could they say the amounts don't matter? You can. You can eat way more than you think you can. As long as you're reading the right shit. Will weightwatchers have completely changed the way they recommend food, like eggs or zero points. Now, Joey, Joey Diaz and Brian Redmond. Brian red beds onto. He was telling me that eggs are zero point zero.

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       You can eat as many eggs as you want. You can eat five eggs. Yeah. People used to say, well, eggs have cholesterol and hello. This is terrible for you for fats and all this. Nope. Nope. Fucking great for you. Sorry. We will live forever. I was fucking reading to my kids a little while back. We had a Dr Seuss book and it had the food pyramid and I go, this food prayer was bullshit. Like, what is this? It's all fucking. The bottom of it is all cereal. Yeah. It's all like cereal and bread. That's like the most important thing. What are you to have the zero point foods on the. Never list. Boneless skinless chicken breast, boneless, skinless Turkey breast ground, lean chicken ground, lean Turkey, thin sliced deli chicken, bro. So it's all fish and shellfish. Wow. Does not include smoked or dried fish? Huh? Why wouldn't include smoked fish?

Speaker 1:          00:29:22       That seems weird. Can fish this packed in water or brined? I eat canned tuna to food or smoke to this. We're all like zero. Nonfat Plain Regular and Greek yogurt. Nonfat ain't good for you. Nonfat anything is nonsense. Eggs, plain soy yogurt, milk, fresh frozen and canned beans and lentils that are packed without oil or sugar. Yeah. Beans and lentils are huge. Yeah. If you could just eat all that stuff on. Mikado is not on there. I guess it's got some fat in it. Well, it's got healthy fats, right? Avocados. Unusual because it has mostly unsaturated fats, but it has saturated fats too. Yeah, it's really good for you. Avocado is a fucking wonderful food. Wonderful.

Speaker 2:          00:30:06       I'm 155 pounds, but I had a fucking belly just because, uh, you know, I was writing on crashing last year and they would have, we'd have like five meals a day, muffins being handed out and I put on six pounds and it always in my belly breads and process shit. And so January first I cut out all bread, all pasta, all sugar, and I've been working out like five days a week and the belly just fucking disappear. You seem like you've got some pep in your step. A little bit, little bit, little bit extra Ritalin also helps. Does it a lot of coffee. Do you ever get your hormones checked? No. No. You probably should see if the testosterone levels there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       You know, that's a major factor in depression. No Shit. Major factor. A major factor in people with head injuries. Yeah. People that have come back from war that have been, um, you know, like a lot of ied has been around, a lot of explosions been jolted, a lot of football players, of course, boxers, MMA fighters, they lose testosterone as they get older, get pituitary damage. Your pituitary gland apparently is incredibly sensitive and some people get it that are jet skiers or into jet skiing because just the

Speaker 2:          00:31:20       right all that bouncing and head banging his head banging his fucking terrible for you. Play soccer and he heads these, the goal, you'll kick the ball all the way down the field and I'll see him headed. I'll be like, dude, just let it fucking bounce. Yeah, yeah. That's heavy impacts. It is in a soccer players get it a lot. He got a concussion from heading against another guy wants.

Speaker 1:          00:31:42       He was out for three weeks. They collided heads. Yeah. Oh God, yeah. Your fucking head. It's so hard. It's like running into another, like a rock, like a bone. Yeah. Someone could beat you to death with a head

Speaker 2:          00:31:56       and you're whipping your head. You're whipping your head at the ball. So like both slamming into each other. Oh yeah. I played hockey my whole life though and never had any major involvement. My neck, I chipped a vertebrae in my neck. That was the only thing that happened. You do that? My, I was small but I was a good skater because I grew up near a lake. So we just skated back before global warming. That lake froze at Christmas and it went till March. We were out there every fucking day. Afterschool, all weekend. All we did was play ice hockey. So when I got to high school, um, I was, I was the only kid who could really skate backwards. Well. So the coach was like, you're on defense. I'm like, I'm a hundred and 15 pounds. So he taught me how to check of usually check with

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       your shoulder, your hip. He taught me how to check guys under the Chin with the top of my head, which I, which I got good at. And then I did it one time and just click and it. And I had, I got a, I got an extra and they're like, yeah, that's, that's chipped. It's nothing we can do about it. To this day, my, my tendons will get caught in my neck on that chip and it will just lock up like once a year, lock up for a couple days on me, like the tendons rub against that area. It's tendons or ligaments or whatever is right there around. You're a vertebrae. Fuck the next dude. Yeah. Terrible. Terrible thing to injure you. Are there good exercises for neck? You don't have a thing called the iron neck. Have you ever heard of him now? Oh, that's fucking amazing. It's out there.

Speaker 4:          00:33:25       I'll show it to you after the show. It's a halo. I've put it on my head and then I pump it up with air and the air locks in place and there's a giant Bungee cord that's on the end of it and I pull it back and the bungee cord is a 50 pound resistance, but they make it lower. They make like several different weights of Bungee. You pull it back to. It's like fully polled and then you can adjust the resistance on the halo itself and so you do these like as you got to pull it back, you turn turn sideways and I do look 10 reps this way. It'll do sideways that way and that'll turn all the way behind and face the opposite direction and do 10. That's amazing. Yeah. And then you do stevie wonder's where you do this, you do a bunch of different exercises.

Speaker 4:          00:34:04       Magic and a girls suck your Dick with that thing on what? She would wear it. She would wear it and then you wouldn't be good because her record would be in the way you run the cord between your legs and then you put your penis in her mouth, but your Dick is going to rub up against the court. I don't understand why you want to do that. That's the thing like that. Oh, I see. I got two of those. I bought one for my house to a fucking. Love it. Wow. I love it. It's so for Jujitsu, it's so important. My neck fucked up in Jujitsu where I was, um, I was getting numb hands. I had a bulging disc in my neck and I just, I think a lot of it came down to my neck just getting just too much abuse and not being strong enough.

Speaker 4:          00:34:47       Yeah. No. So, so I love that thing. Yeah. That's why I've never done Jujitsu. I've wanted to, but I know my neck would get fucked up immediately. Everything gets fucked up, but it's fun. Yeah, it's awesome. It's like your body's not going to make it. Yeah. It's like how much abuse do you want to give it before it breaks? Totally. A good question. You know, I mean, Anthony Bordain that fucking savage, 58 years old starts doing Jujitsu. Start it. Started. No shit started. Wow. He's a bad ass because he been on the show. Yeah. Long time ago. Yeah. So we always talk about doing it again. But yeah, he travels so fucking much everywhere. Literally everywhere. I love that show. I, I, when I'm on the road at sometimes CNN will run a marathon and he shows I'll just sit there and watch everyone. Even when he's in the US, it's always interesting. He finds like he'll find a pocket of Cajun

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       people that have like a 78 people in the family and they make this special kind of jumbled Leia.

Speaker 1:          00:35:44       Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's, he found his thing. Yeah. He really did find his thing. Was he a musician before? What did he do? So chef, who's the chef, he's a chef and he wrote a book called kitchen confidential is really good book. And then after the book became successful, he started doing a show on the travel channel. I think it might've even been called kitchen kitchen confidential. Then did another show that was called no reservations. That's where I met him. I met him when he was still doing no reservation, so that's when he did. He did my show back when he was doing in my house. And then, uh, I did his show. I did it recently too. I did it recently in Montana. We went pheasant hunting. No Shit. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Oh Wow. Yeah, it was awesome. Did he ever run into drugs?

Speaker 1:          00:36:28       He was a serious heroin addict. That's what I thought. Yeah, but he kicked the heroin and still drink. Still drinks. I know. That's amazing. Yeah. Well he's, I mean he figured out how to do it. Yeah. But he works out every day. Yeah, the trains every day. I mean he brings his Jujitsu ski with him everywhere he goes. He goes on the road, like when we were in Montana, he went to, um, we were outside of Bozeman I think somewhere outside of Bozeman. So he found a Jujitsu club in Bozeman and met them and just went there and trained with them during the day. I was like, you're a fucking animal. No, she's addicted to it. He goes to like, he was in Croatia, you told me it was in like, I forget where it was, but some Asia type place. Some Serbia is one of them fucking Albania with one of them crazy places. And he said he was shitting out bone chips because these guys were just smashing them. And I was like, dude, fucking doing that. They were old school crossing Gracie, top control guys and they're fucking crushing him. And he's like, dude, I'm shitting bone chips. I'm like doing of yourself. That's amazing. But he's like, he's at an age where a lot of people would, they would back off, they would think, oh my body is frail. I'm going to ride this off into the sunset. It's like, fuck you.

Speaker 2:          00:37:40       Well all exercise is really sub sublimating pain on some level. I mean even even a light jog, you are in pain and so you don't have to do it. I think you're doing it wrong. Oh, I'm always in pain. I feel like when I jog I feel like I feel afraid. I'm gonna die. And I think when people see me jogging, they think I'm running from something. Like I'm scared. Like that's the panic on my face. What hurts my back. I think the next settled into my back and I have slight scoliosis. So, um, and then my, my wrists and ankles for some reason about a year ago started to get sore. Like I can't do pushups anymore. I had to buy those, those grips that you put on the ground because I couldn't, I can't put my hands flat. What part hurts the whole wrist? The whole. All the ligaments in the wrist hurt.

Speaker 1:          00:38:33       Hmm. And they hurt. Does it? An overuse thing?

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       I'd get hurt from now because it's both of them. I don't know what I could have been doing with both of them. Have you tried doing it since you cut bread and everything out of your diet? I think it probably is better. It is better. I bet it is. Yeah. That was the first thing a therapist told me. Physical therapist. She got not a mental therapist. Like cut bread out. Yeah. You got mental problems. I'm no, a physical therapist told me she was like, you'd be surprised if you cut bread out of your diet. Just inflammation. Inflammation. How much your back would feel better and feel better. I thought it was 100 percent horseshit. I was like, oh, this is like hippie chiropractor. Talk. Good luck. Yeah. And then I did it and I was like, oh. Like everything feels better. You don't realize it.

Speaker 4:          00:39:17       Like that puffy feeling that you get in your face though. I get, I get fat face if I, uh, if I eat too much bread and pasta, I get, you know, you start getting a little gut, but that's also in your joints, man. That's everywhere. Everything's inflamed. So it's all like not good. Your body's like, what is this shit and how do we get rid of this? It's fucking hard on the road not to eat bread dough. It's so hard to find a meal. It doesn't have bread and unless you want to eat like, you know, some, some salad from starbucks, so uninspired salad and it was made by somebody with a hair net that was also making like stale, stale tasting muffins. They come out of the oven, they're already stale tasting. I was at a starbucks recently and there was a played out with, you know, they put the muffin pieces while you're waiting. And so I, I eat more than I should, you know, you should probably just have one I think is the protocol. And I have like three of them. And uh, this woman comes up, she goes, why are you eating my muffin?

Speaker 4:          00:40:18       It was hers. I go, I'm so sorry, I go, let me buy you another muffin. And, and instead of going, Nah, don't worry about. She was like, yeah. So I bought her another muffin and she wasn't really like laughing about it or anything. She was. Yeah, yeah. You were saying that. I was like, I don't know that they do that. Oh fuck yeah. Fuck off coffee shops. Starbucks. Yeah. But why was there a muffin chopped up into little pieces that seems weird to. I was crummy. It was kind of pulled apart crummy. Hmm. Yeah. Okay. Seems Weird. Have you ever, um, gone to Katz Deli in New York shore? Remember when the Ludlow Stromae for you? Yeah. And the corn beef and they give you a little bit and you're like, Holy Shit. Like while you're waiting, they chop it up and slide it forward and best Pastrami in the city. Yeah, we just looked it up the other day. That place started out in the 18 hundreds. No Shit. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Largo was a half a block away, so if you stand up there and I always stop and get a pastrami sandwich. There was a a no Luna Lounge. He was. Oh, okay. Yeah. There's no place like that here except canter's cancers. All right. It's

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       a, you know, I, I find their astronomy's just doesn't have that. That tenderness that you get Second Avenue Deli in New York. Never been. That's the best. That is the best. Yeah. Yeah. I think. I think cancers is good. I think it's the best in La. I do too. I just don't think it's that good.

Speaker 4:          00:41:54       Well, he just not gonna it's hard to get those immigrants to come all the way across and settle in and be successful out here and have like a real spot. Right. But there's a lot of Jewish people out here. You'd think there'd be more like Jerry's Deli is good. Middle of the road. Yeah. They have good chicken noodle soup. Right. But they don't have. It's like there's a difference between a real Italian restaurant in New York City and an Italian restaurant in studio city. Yeah. Right. Just fucking different. Yeah. There's just no getting around it. If you want to survive and like I needed just to survive. You can have linguine with clams at some nice place to studio city, but it won't be the same. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:33       Now that place car a car. Mine's. What's our. Our tourists. There's a place on Mulberry Street that was the oldest Italian restaurant in New Year in a little Italy and it just burned down.

Speaker 4:          00:42:44       Dude, I remember when you lived in little Italy in a mob owned building. Yeah. Tony and gladys

Speaker 2:          00:42:49       from my landlords. That's right. And they had a. they'd had the apartment. They raised their kids there and they were like, they were like in their late seventies and so they, their, their son Gregory who was in construction and lived in directly or quotes in construction and so he bought them a condo around the corner because it was a, it was a six floor walk up and so one free. You can pull it up on the screen. One 42. Mulberry. Explain to people that don't know what that means. That means you walk up six flights of stairs, couches and shit. Yeah, right, right. Well, they're all, their furniture was there when I got there, they let me keep and it was, I'm not making this up, plastic on the furniture and I found, uh, I found, uh, an ease of phone eavesdropping thing like where you could record phone calls in the drawer and um, they deiced to pay them the rent once a month, not by check. They wanted cash and it was George Mcdonald live with me and we would walk down this end and Lauren debraski would walk down the street to Spring Street, go to their condo and we'd give them, if it was $600, we'd give that to gladys and Tony look at it, right? Yeah, there we go. And they would make cappuccinos and Canelo lease. We'd sit there and talk to them and then Tony would go in the next room and we give gladys another 150 [inaudible]. That was her bingo money. And Tony don't need to know about that. Oh, that.

Speaker 4:          00:44:12       Oh, that's right. Yeah. And uh, they were having a Lauren Dubroski she passed away. No cancer. Oh, that's right. Yeah. She ended up as a big executive producer at mad tv for like 10 years. Really? Yeah. You know Bobby Lee, she, she sponsored a lot of people to get sober. I mean, you, I know a half a dozen people that she sponsored to get sober. Bobby Lee is one of them. She was, she was a comedy team with. Yeah, a couple of, couple of broads. I don't remember what their name was. Who was the, I think it was called a couple of broad. Who was the, uh, the other one was uh. Oh, is there. Fuck. Rick Jenkins used to date her. Yes. And she ended up doing a film. She moved out to Hollywood to make it and uh, about a year and a half later this softcore porn came up with her in it and she had the sickest body smoking and that was a vhs tape to kept passed around. That was greasy. Covered in DNA.

Speaker 4:          00:45:15       Yeah. Um, but lauren was a really sweet, special person. She was great. She's a very nice person. Yeah, that's right. I forgot that she passed away. I never ran into. I ran into her once out here a long time ago. More than 15, 16 years ago. Yeah. There is those comics that are that like Colin Quinn is. One of them were just. They have saved so many comics in trouble. It's amazing. How's he? Oh yeah, a great guy. Yeah. He helped, uh, well tried to help Geraldo. I shouldn't name people's names if it's program stuff, but a, well, some people are open about it. Yeah. I think all comics are, becomes a part of your fucking back. Right? Right. And who, who, who gets sober and doesn't start talking about it. Yeah. That's like Jesus Christ. Why wouldn't you mind that? I think a lot of comics start in a rooms. They get up and they, you know, they qualify, which is when you speak in a room and they go, oh yeah. Remember Dave, right dave out fucking one great joke of remember this one great joke that he had about being in Catholic school and he did something wrong and the priest smacked him in the head and he goes, which is exactly how I think Jesus would have handled it.

Speaker 4:          00:46:35       And she, this method of delivery, you know, he was just a funny guy. Like he was one of those guys that you saw him on stage. You Go, oh, this guy's got to be funny. Oh, I mean it's, it's amazing. Some people that the deck is loaded, you walk on stage. He's had this gravelly voice and this big square head. And he just said yes, as soon as that thick. I think he was from East Boston, that thick accent. And He, when he was a fucking mailman, he was like a real blue collar guy and a lifetime of stories. Yeah. He's a guy who became a pro real quick. Yes. I remember like being real impressed with him because he was like a little bit ahead of me. I was, I was starting out as an open mic or, and he was real maybe a year ahead and he was starting to get work and I'm like, this guy fucking took it seriously. Yeah, because he was older. I think he was 40 when he was getting started and so he

Speaker 1:          00:47:30       had his notebook and he was like really organized with his bets and he had like some philosophy about like why he would, why would take a pause and why he would rush this part where he would take that part and I was like, this guy's putting a lot of thought and effort into.

Speaker 2:          00:47:45       I remember going down to see Paula poundstone perform at the comedy connection and he was the feature act and he went up and as the feature got a standing ovation. I was like, Holy Shit. That doesn't happen.

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       No, he was good. He got sick. He got sick and died as well. Yeah, right. I think this is just a lifetime of drugs and alcohol just caught up to him unfortunately. Right when he was right when he was, you know, getting his shit together. Right, right. There was so many of those guys. I mean, how many guys did we start out with that were alcoholics or former alcoholics? Yeah. Fucking everybody. All of them.

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       Yeah. And they're all. And that was the thing about when you were an open or a Boston, it was like the criteria. Where are you funny enough to cover 15 minutes to open number two, do you have a functioning automobile that you can take these dui headliners to the Gig with? Because none of them had licenses. And so I can remember like picking up Gavin Pickin up sweetie, picking up Mike Mcdonald and having to drive these guys out to wherever. And then you couldn't leave early because you were driving them home. They'd give you a few bucks for gas and you were happy to do it. You're like, Holy Shit, I'm going to be in a car with don. And so one time nick's next stop calling me up and they're like, you're working in Framingham. You get to drive the feature and the headliner out. And I go downtown to pick them up in front of Nick's. And I've got a uh, I had a 1976 Volkswagen Rabbit, four cylinder, rusted out floor boards and I get down there and it's Mike Sullivan, Irwin who weighed about 300 pounds. And John Pinette is about to 75 and they saw my car and they both started giggling like school girls.

Speaker 5:          00:49:25       We're going to fucking go to a Gig in this car.

Speaker 2:          00:49:27       So we, we pack them in and I couldn't get on. I couldn't get the car go on above like 40. So instead of taking the mass pike at West to Framingham, I had to take a route nine the whole way.

Speaker 5:          00:49:41       Forty miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       Hilarious. Like you carry lumber on the roof. Fucking 800 pounds of humans in my car. I remember Mike Sullivan, but I remember when he was Mike Sullivan, they became like Sullivan Irvin. He's the first guy that ever met that took his wife's last name. Is that why? Yeah, he was a feminist first male feminists. Self proclaimed male feminists that everyone too. It's hilarious. Very nice guy. Yeah, sweetheart. Super Sweetheart Guy. And uh, that didn't work. He stopped doing comedy, right? I think he died. Oh, Jesus Christ. It's a bummer. It's a bummer of a podcast. I think he died as well. And John Pinette died as well as well, you know. Yeah. That's why. I'm glad you're doing cardio.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       That's right. Well, you know, I'm 51 and my dad died at 51 of a heart attack, so I take that shit seriously. Eating right and exercising. I mean he also smoked three and a half packs a day and was an alcoholic. So different, different circumstances. It is crazy

Speaker 1:          00:50:43       how much of that shit is genetic, you know? Yeah. And I've always admired that. You figured out when we were really young. I mean when I met you, you quit and you know, we were both in our early twenties and you were like, fuck this. I'm not, I'm not going down that road. And you didn't need anything. You didn't, you didn't need alcoholics anonymous. So you're like, no, not doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:51:04       I did some therapy. That helps. I just needed to realize that once I realized that and I had gone to Alanon because of my dad, adult child of alcoholic meetings, which helped me phenomenal amount just to realize that, um, that it's a disease and that, you know, you're powerless to it. And that for me, I was able to apply what I learned in there because I went to a couple of AA meetings and in Boston it was like guys would get up and they were like, and then I blow a guy for a sandwich and I passed out in the fucking and said, you know, it's like I couldn't relate. I mean, my thing was like, I fucked a fat chick, you know, that was my bottom. I had a three way with a couple girls who were a plus net. And so, uh, so I could, but I, but I, I read the literature of the 12 steps and it helped me because it made me realize that when I wanted to drink something was going on and to this day I just have that reaction. I know that I still want to drink all the time, but when I really want to drink I stopped and I go, alright, what's stressing you out? What do you need to deal with? And then I just kind of focus on it.

Speaker 1:          00:52:07       No, yeah, there was, um, when I was a kid, my, my dad was an architect. And so I worked on a lot of construction sites and I met a lot of junkies, a lot of junkies, lot of people in construction sites are either alcoholics or drug addicts. And there was this one guy that I really liked. He's a funny guy, man. Really Funny Guy. And he's in a band, his name was Robbie. Funny fucking dude. Loved hanging around with them, but just stay off the coke wow. Couldn't stay off the coke and you could totally tell he was. And he would, he'd be honest about it to see how he went off the rails and you know, and you know, and he would, we would be working together. He was a carpenter and I was like, uh, uh, labor. So I was like an apprentice. And so he'd be talking to me, why? Explain to me how to do things and stuff like that. And I was like, yeah, you know, I'm just fucking tired of this. I'm getting my shit together. The bands getting back together again, we're writing songs and this and that. And then he'd come in Monday looking like shit, just looking like shit real grumpy. Didn't want to talk, had a headache and you know, and he didn't get it, went off the rails

Speaker 2:          00:53:15       May. The saddest thing is that when you first start doing drugs, and I don't know about you, but I, I had a phenomenal time doing cocaine, mushrooms and all this stuff I did as a teenager was like beef. I never got hooked on it and if you do it, you know, maybe I did coke 50 times without ever getting hooked. It's a blast. That's the, that's the best kept secret. But then once you get hooked, you're not even having fun anymore. You're just maintaining. You're just feeding it so you don't crash. You know, with, with heroin, you're just trying to avoid withdrawals. You're not even feeling that great anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:53:52       I think with Robbie to, part of the problem was he was very disappointed in himself. Yeah, know it was booze too. He would just go off the rails and try to keep it going. You know, it's like there's a lot of people out there that they have a dream and then the pressure of trying to reach that dream, like his dream is to be in a successful band. Right. And the pressure of trying to reach that dream and see it to fruition, it's just seems it seems unreachable. Yeah. It seems too far off. And here you are, you're in your thirties and you're working a construction job and you know, you fucking work all day in Boston in the winter. You're tired as shit when you get home, you don't want to go to band practice. You get home at 6:30, have dinner now it's 7:30. You got to get up, right? You've got to get up in a few hours. What are you doing? When are you going to bed? You know, you've got to get up at six. Then you got a band

Speaker 2:          00:54:42       practice and the drummer doesn't shell up so you can't practice.

Speaker 1:          00:54:45       So our 45 minutes late, his car breaks down and you're fucking pissed and you're screaming at you. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:54:52       yeah, yeah. And then try to have a relationship on top of that. Tell that girl you can't go out on Saturday night ever because you're doing gigs

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       and then the gigs suck and you're not making any money. And she should get a job. The gigs. You should get a job. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       And then you're in a band. So girls, they've thrown themselves at you having an affair. She's got some coke.

Speaker 1:          00:55:13       No, it's good. No story turned around. Turned it around. Now it's exciting again.

Speaker 2:          00:55:23       Sometimes when I've worked at casino, there will always be that band in the lounge just playing like born to be wild and all the songs and like you'll see people that are like 57 dancing and you see them in their dancing and it's like they're just reliving the only joy they had in their life, which was like when they were young dance in Iraq and this band is fucking their gods. To them

Speaker 1:          00:55:49       you the, the time when you're young, when you're having fun is so fleeting. Yeah. Then all of a sudden responsibility stuck up and all of a sudden you know, you have to pay bills, you have obligations, you have so much that you have to think about. Yeah. For so many people, there's just. There's this period of their life where they look back to whimsically like that was the time when I was free. I was young, my Dick got hurt all the time. I could go two or three times,

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       three times in a night like, shit, man, I can't believe it. And you think anything is possible. I mean, that's really can happen. That's the loss of innocence is when you realize that a certain point that you do have to pick a path and stay on it, you better [inaudible] you gotta pay the bills with it and you know what's so sad is you see people that work so fucking hard for not a lot of money and you know, Bill's just add up and then they save just enough when they get their vacation twice a year, the good like accrues and they'll just drink nonstop for a week. At the end of it, they're just hung over. They blew the excess money they had and that was it. That's what you worked all year for out a friend of mine and working in restaurant and uh, one of the guys who worked with saved up his money for eight years, went to Vegas and ballooned in one day.

Speaker 4:          00:57:20       It was the most heartbreaking story. This poor guy, I think he was a dishwasher and he worked there for eight years. Set aside 50 here. Twenty five. They're set aside for eight fucking years. Yeah. And I think it was some good amount of money, like $30,000. She went there with a plan. This is it baby. I'm good at blackjack or whatever the fuck he played. He read a book. A lot of guys read books. You can win money, you can win money playing blackjack, but you know what's fucked up when you do, if you get good at it, they ban you. I know. It's crazy was. Yeah. The other crazy thing is in black jack there's there's like multitech and they're single deck blackjack and the payout on single deck is less instead of three to two odds you get paid like, I forget what it is, but you get, you get less of a payout when you hit black Jack and the rules and more restrictive about like splitting aces and all that stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:58:21       So the implication is with a single deck you can count cards. That's why they pay you less, but if you get caught counting cards, you get thrown out of the casino, the fuck. Did they catch you counting cards and isn't it normal that you are using strategy to try to win the game like crazy. Like you can't try so hard, right? That's like if you're playing pool and you aim the aim Ayman or when they don't let you use drugs in sports, man, they make you better. They definitely make you better. Why should we not have drugs in sports? Well, because were out of your body because you don't want the children to get the wrong message. You're writing and drugs are the only way to win. Yeah. I think that should be a supernaturally and the natural league. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. Supernaturally is you just go get one of them fucking Russian guys from that Icarus documentary and you just.

Speaker 4:          00:59:14       What do you got, baby? Let's do this shit and you find out what happens. The problem is legitimately, if you do go whole hog and take the fucking full steroid route, you're definitely redlining your body. You're doing some shit to your body that your endocrine system is gonna. Shut down. You're putting ungodly stress on all sorts of parts of your body because the workload that your body's putting out is just super human. But for those brief shining moments, you can absolutely performed better on. That's what it's about. And as a viewer, I want to see them run faster and hit harder and jump higher and you know, and honestly they're jocks. This is what they were bred to do. They are, they are the jock class, pe. They did it their whole lives. They've dreamed of the shining moment. Let them have their shining moment.

Speaker 4:          01:00:08       Right? But what about the natural athletes? What about the Hershel Walker's out there that don't need it? All right. Well, they're in the other league. Well, for them they're like, well, you shouldn't be a fucking athlete and know I need it. Right. Or I don't need it. You need it. Yeah. But I always wondered about those guys because they'd be honest that they don't take it. Like Hershel Walker look deep into his forties, was claiming that he never took anything and uh, that he only ate a bowl of soup and a salad a day. No, shit doesn't make sense. It didn't, didn't his mother do the Campbell's soup commercial. I don't know. The thing about Herschel though is that he also has multiple personality disorder or no shit. I think he has um, stress or trauma induced trauma induced multiple personality disorder. So it's entirely possible that when he says, I only took a bowl of soup and a salad, he's telling the truth, but that's him.

Speaker 4:          01:01:05       There's like five other people that live inside his brain and they've been eating steak all day steroids. Right. I don't know. Fascinating. I'm always the trauma. Do you know? Well, I think he had a really rough childhood. There was a lot of psychological abuse, physical abuse, and then there was football abuse. I think all those things. I mean there is no way you're getting out of football for free. You're getting fucking hit hard and that's trauma. So there's trauma, psychological trauma. I don't know. He's talked about it pretty openly though. But what's interesting is even after all that he still fought. He fought. A lot of people don't know. He fought in strikeforce. I didn't know that. Pete the Fuck Addison people, dude, he's a legit martial artist. Shit Dude. He was in his forties like 46 to 48. I believe he fought in strikeforce and when I say he was jacked, I mean Jack full six pack, shredded 46 years old. Just manhandling lesser athletes and beating the fuck out of them in what you Jitsu mma and he fought in strikeforce. Strikeforce was a league that the UFC one that purchasing and we took all their fighters and it came over in. A lot of guys like Gilbert Melendez

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       was champ over there. Josh Thompson, like real high level fighters, Luke rockhold, they all came over from strikeforce and Herschel Walker was over there and it's a lot of people like super skeptical. Like, what is this some freak show? Herschel Walker is gonna fight. Come on man. Herschel Walker is an old football player and then you see him. You're like Jesus Freak athlete. Just a freak of nature. So you think he must've been using steroids? No, no, it's not. Not. Must have no need. Definitely. I mean always get suspicious when you see someone who's a freak, but there are real freaks. Like just let John Holmes had a giant Dick. It didn't take steroids to have a giant Dick. He just had a giant Dick. Some girls have enormous tits. Why? Oh, they just do like there's no, there's no even body, like there's no equality in physical construction and some people just get born with freak body parts. Yeah. And they just are. There's, there's athletes that are just way better than you will ever be no matter what you do. Yeah. I think Hershel Walker's unquestionably one of those. It's just how long did you maintain it?

Speaker 2:          01:03:24       I mean, I watched the Olympics and I'm the curling. I love, you know, curling. The thing is, is it's not much to watch, but I would pay a lot of money to just fucking get high one day and curl. Really? How much out of money? $50,000. Housing dollars. Thousand dollars to curl. One day. Why? But I mean that's for all my friends, it pays for the whole curling corey the whole day. Everybody get bored after like 10 minutes. I don't know really. I mean I love games like that. Like I love a ladder ball, you know, where this like a two sticks and it's got like a ladder that goes between it and its got a ball with a rope between the two balls and you whip it. I can play that for upwards of three or four hours. We have it in the backyard three or four hours nonstop. I just get, I get so competitive and so obsessed. Uh, horseshoes,

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       Botchy Ball, horseshoes or fun? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know man. Just get into such a groove. Like Pool, right? Yeah. No, I mean you and I have played pool for three hours easily. Oh yeah. Easily. We could have today, if we didn't stop and do the podcast, we probably would have kept going.

Speaker 2:          01:04:29       Well son is a good luck to Sam, Ohio today. And the soccer playoffs third round undefeated this year. Do you like watching soccer? I love watching it, but I love watching my son play. There's few joys in the world like watching my son play soccer. It's crazy, right? A person who's out there running around. Yeah, I know. And you just see. Well, because no matter how old your kid gets, you still see them as a little kid and then when you see them out there on the field with these and you see the size of the other guys and how aggressive they are and you're like, Holy Shit, my little kid is in there holding his own and he's a physical player and uh, it's just uh, and you know, you get to know the parents and the kids and it's like a whole, it's like being a fan of a sport, but you actually know the players. Yeah. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:05:15       there's, there's something, I think that's incredibly important for kids to learn how to compete and also learn what it feels like to lose and that bad feeling. Yeah, it was a lot of people that grew up and they were never involved in competitive sports. They were never involved in any sort of competitive games and they just don't know what it's like to lose. And I think that's a valuable lesson in life to. I think it teaches you a lot about rejection from the opposite sex or the same sex we are in that shit. Um, I think it teaches you a lot about not getting the job that you want a lot. I think it teaches you a lot about real competition in the real world and it gets, you used to that weird feeling of competing at a young age. So it becomes normal, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:05:58       Yeah. To Go. Well, because I think there's, um, there's a shame with being competitive these days because everything is so politically correct that you shouldn't be an Alpha, you shouldn't be progressive, you shouldn't try to beat somebody down. And in sports it gives you a safe place to realize that that's a part of our makeup that's a part of your, your whole psyche is to want to compete. You want to challenge, you know, to beat Darwinian and that there is a place to do it. And then there's a place to not do it. Yeah. Well it's easier to find the place to not do it when you do it. Right. And this is the thing about Jujitsu that I always try to explain to people. Jujitsu practitioners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet and one of the reasons why is they get all that stupid shit out on the mats and they're tired all the time too.

Speaker 1:          01:06:48       So they're like, they don't want to start any bullshit. Like I don't want to deal. And plus they don't need their egos stroked their egos getting beaten down and stroked all the time. Stroking and tap somebody beaten down when you get tapped out and you have to get used to it in order to get to a certain rank. Like if, say if you get up to like purple belt or Brown, but with somebody who knows how many hundreds of times he'd been tapped out and who knows, I have no idea how many times have been tapped out, but it's probably thousands. No Shit. How could it not be? Wow. All those years of doing Jujitsu, 20 years of doing jude, 20 plus years of doing Jujitsu and all the times I rolled and the, all the times our role people better than me. I've been fucking choked and arm barred and you just get used to it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:30       It's not fun. You don't enjoy it, but what you do enjoy is that you've experienced something that you didn't have an answer for. And so, you know, there's work to be done and that's Jujitsu's endless. It's endless. You know? Um, there was a guy who explained this. How has the explanation so far a brilliant Helson gracie explained it to someone who didn't understand your Jujitsu and he's got this thick Brazilian accent. It's, I do this and then you do that. And then I do this, and then you do that. And then I do this for ever that's Jujutsu. It's like it's constantly move and defense and counter and defense and attack. When I hear people describe it as a chess match, it is, but chess pieces

Speaker 2:          01:08:16       only moved one way.

Speaker 3:          01:08:17       It's so dynamic and kinetic. And so they're always adding new moves to. There's all these new moves and people are constantly learning. Yeah, it's, it's, um, but the thing is you're using your body. Your body is what is being attacked and your body's what you're using to attack. So, you know, you see things give out while you're attacking and things give out while you're getting attacked. And I think there's not enough to just two guys who, um, I think if I was going to advise people, one of the things that I would advise is you should have a regular conditioning strength and conditioning routine just to strengthen your joints, strengthened your limb, strengthen your back. Yoga. I think strength and conditioning and yoga are almost as important, not as important as Jujitsu itself to get good at it, but almost as important to prevent injuries and to allow you to reach your full physical potential.

Speaker 2:          01:09:09       [inaudible] yeah. So I mean, in terms of that being a life lesson, it's um, I think when you can physicalize something that then becomes like in a workplace more of a mental thing, you realize that being tapped out in the workplace can mean everybody gets fired on a regular basis. People used to get one job and they would keep it for 30 years. You get a gold watch and a pension. Now the average job, I don't know what it is, Jamie, what's the average lifespan of a job? Three years. Four years? I think so I think people tend to bounce around a lot more. And so I think that life people get divorced and they have it. They have other successful relationships, you know, like somebody was saying, we like today, like that joke, the Henny youngman joke, take my wife please. It doesn't make sense anymore because you would have fucking left her. You wouldn't be saying, take my wife, you know, and so, so I think that it's a life is filled, more transitions and being able to accept and almost be, like you said, learn from, be empowered and strengthened by a change as opposed to defeated by it.

Speaker 3:          01:10:13       Well, no one gets through life perfect. You just don't. So if you think other people are getting through life perfect and you're fucking up all the time, you feel terrible about it. Yeah, but you got to realize that those fuck ups in those terrible moments, those are valuable learning experiences and the people that I know that the most interesting have failed the hardest. They've had these colossal fuck ups and then they rebuilt themselves and then understand it also gives you like a certain amount of humility and compassion for other people because you know, you've realized like, Hey, this is not like no one rides the wave forever. Yeah, you crash, you hit the coral gets scratched up.

Speaker 2:          01:10:52       You get fucked up. I've never served. I shouldn't use those analogies, but you grow from it or you become evil from it. We had. Well, you could definitely can. Yeah, you could definitely become evil from defeat. But I just think um, I mean it's a fucked up thing. I mean, it's a weird thing to say, but I really think we all collectively

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       as a species need to emphasize and learn how to be nicer to each other. Nobody teaches you that. It's rare. They teach you in school, be nice when you go to offices. There's, you know, there's certain standards of behavior that you're supposed to behave in, but there's not like an emphasis on kindness and just being friendly and I think that that doesn't diminish competition. Like you can be friendly and kind to people that you're competing with as hard as you can. That was also a thing that you find in Jujitsu guys who were just trying to kill each other all the time or like really close friends really close and you know, very competitive. Like motherfucker, I'm getting you tonight. No Bitch. You not like that kind of shit, but friendly.

Speaker 2:          01:12:00       Well, because there's a safety, because there's rules and in the workplace the rules are much more nebulous and what you do to get ahead, kissing a bosses asked, sabotaging a project. Is that part of competitive or is that over the line? Whereas with Jujitsu you'll get called on a foul.

Speaker 1:          01:12:16       Yeah. Sabotaging a project. Imagine working with somebody and they're sabotaging. When you're trying to accomplish now go to the boss and talking shit behind your back about your project and what you're trying to achieve. That's one of the most soul sucking things about jobs. The fakeness, the the office banter, nonsense fakeness. I just think as a, as a species, just the human race, especially us as Americans because we are so God damn competitive color, I'd be nicer.

Speaker 2:          01:12:49       I think it starts with manners. I think it starts with. I mean as a parent, manners, they seem trivial, but it creates the paradigm for Nice. Just thank you. Please hold a door, donate like don't eat until everybody's served their food. They're all little signals to people that you care about them and respect them and I think it spills over and it informs your other actions when you have good manners. Right. Look, people in the eye. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:13:18       yeah, yeah. It'd be pulled. And when people do that to you, you get a good feeling, you know? Well, you know, when someone holds open the door for you or someone says thank you. Like I said hi to some guy. The other day I was walking by him in the hallway of the hotel. I go, how you doing man? He just stared at me and immediately I was like, why? I was angry, you know? Immediately like part of my instinct was like, fuck you man. Yeah. Then part of me was like, that poor bastard, you know? And I went with that poor bastard. Like, oh, that's his life. I just said Hi. I'm just trying to be nice. Yeah. But he looked, looked at me like I was almost like I was weak and saying hi to them. Right. You know,

Speaker 2:          01:13:56       I was raised to like, like if I see somebody with bags, I helped them. And it makes me feel fucking great. It feels good to help people. Yeah. I think I was raised and that's the thing about being raised Catholic because I was raised. Were you raised Catholic? I was raised Catholic

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       too. First grade after first grade we kind of abandoned it, but even up until then it's, it, it's, it gives you a lot of, um, it's a life of service. It's very much about helping people. It's very much she, you know, he could say what you want about the Catholics, but you know, they were in the trenches and a lot of third world countries, nuns and, you know, they, they, they did a lot of good. And uh, and I think that rubbed off on me. My parents both always did a lot of charity work. I do a lot of charity work with my kids and you know, that's going to stay with them. I think we throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to religion and even just rigid ideologies. I think there's, there's something about religion that can absolutely help some people.

Speaker 4:          01:14:52       And there's aspects of it that are very beneficial. Having that code to live by, you know, even if it's because of the fucking spaghetti monster in the sky, like whatever it is that you believe, but if you really act that, that thing, act like that thing is watching over you and that there's codes and tenants that you have to live by, like most of the tenants of Christianity, if you look at them, if you really follow Jesus has rule, which most people don't, but if you really did, you'd be doing a lot of great work. You know, you'd be helping people. You'd be treating each other as if they were your brothers and sisters. The neediest. I mean, that's who Jesus helped the beggars in the street and the prostitutes and you know, that was some hardcore shit he was doing back then. And um, yeah, I think it's like the 10 commandments you can live by, I don't know, eight of them.

Speaker 4:          01:15:37       Eight of them are pretty good to live by. I'm still gonna cover. My neighbor's wife Covet. She's fucking hot. Do you know what that was about? It wasn't about that. What was it about your neighbors? She was possession. She was covet like she was a possession of the neighbor. Like she. He owned her. Right? Oh, that's right. Yeah, and the same thing stood for the commandment. If you really read it says, do not covet thy neighbor's wife or they neighbor, slave, slave, slave. It's a donkey. I think it's donkey enslave. Really? Yup. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Don't, don't try to steal their slave. You can keep slaves. Just walk them from your neighbor. It's just so obvious that what they were talking about back then was all wrapped around the way people thought about things. Then yeah, you know, but they knew even then, even thousands of years ago, they knew there's a right way to do things and there's a wrong way to do things.

Speaker 4:          01:16:35       There's, when you pick up the people's bags, you feel good. Let's tell kids that. Let's teach people that you pick up the bags, you feel good. You hold the door open, you feel good. You help someone. You feel good. Like, okay, let's. This is obviously we all want to feel good, right? How do we feel like there's moments in my life where I feel terrible where I've done something wrong or a fucked up something or just failed and I just feel terrible and I always think when I do have that feeling of, Oh God, I fucking hate this feeling. Why can't I feel great? Why can't I just feel awesome right now? Well, because it didn't go and this is

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       like the psychic reminder. This is that jolt of energy that's letting you know like, hey, you went on a wrong path. You fucked up you tank this, you crashed that you did wrong. Like you're supposed to feel like shit. Right? So that you don't do it again. Yeah. But conversely, when something good happens, when you help someone, when someone can't get their bag in the overhead because it's too heavy and you help them and you hand it to them, they smile at you and you smile at them. You walk off the plane, you feel good, you feel good. You've got to teach that to like, you have to remember that and you have to go, why do I feel so good? Oh, I felt so good because it helped that lady. Yeah. You know, I felt so good because I said hi to that guy and like I say hi me back and we looked at each other and go, you know, made some niceties or whatever.

Speaker 3:          01:17:53       Yeah. And that's, that's part of the joy of life is those friendly, fun, Nice interactions with people. But when you got your shit in order, it's easier to have those experiences when you don't. My personal experience, when I don't have my shit in order and I've made mistakes and I'm, I fucked something up. It's very hard for me to enjoy anything. Yeah. I just go through the motions. I just, I feel like, Oh, if I have something that I fucked up and then I have that terrible feeling, but I have to hang out with my family and my kids. I just ride it out. I just have to ride it out. I try to be real friendly and real sweet, but I don't feel good inside. I feel terrible and I go, well, this is going to go away with contemplation, with understanding. It's going to.

Speaker 3:          01:18:37       This feeling is gonna go away, but you got to ride it out. You know, and I know I can ride it out because I've read it out, wrote it out before, but for some people, man, they don't know what to do there. Don't they don't know what that feeling is. They feel like this is their life and then that feeling, if you don't conquer it, you get comfortable with it. You get used to it. You used to failing, you get used to that terrible feeling and then you start pouring booze on that terrible feeling or pouring drugs or.

Speaker 2:          01:19:02       Well, it also becomes like A. I was in therapy and I remember the therapist told me that you, we all have a narrative of our lives and you can choose that narrative. It's that fucking simple. That's basically what behavioral therapy tells you is that it's all a projection. Everything in your life as a projection. You know, you say, I have these attributes, I've accomplished these things. Or you can say, I lacked these things and I fucked up these things and you can live your life putting that energy out to people and it's as simple as just literally sitting down and thinking about how you want to see yourself and just keep, keep reminding yourself of that and you'll start to live. And I mean, this sounds so fucking hokey to oversimplified, but it's real, but it's real, you know, and, and part of the thing, the downside of religion is that I was raised with a lot of shame and guilt. And so those periods you're talking about where you fucked up and you're feeling bad and you got to ride it out. You throw shame on top of that and it extends it and it makes it more profound. And it's not just about your action and how it might have affected other people. It's about original sin, you know, heavy, original sin shed, Garden of Eden, where evil, you know, we're dirty. We need to confess, we need to be cleansed, throw all that on top of a simple mistake. And again, it makes it complex.

Speaker 3:          01:20:27       Okay? Yeah Man, the sin. And the pain and the suffering that mean island went through one year of Catholic school, but that one year when I was six years old, first grade, I was like, this is ridiculous. These people are crazy. Yeah. I'm not this bad. I just knew that my parents got split up when I was five and then I was really confused. I was like, I can't believe my mom and dad aren't together anymore. And there was screaming and hitting and a lot of violence. And it was just, it was good that my mom got out because I learned that when something is terrible, like you don't just stay and get smacked around you leave. But the bad thing was it just through my whole life into chaos and I wanted some order and things. And one of the things that I turned to for order was religion.

Speaker 3:          01:21:19       Even though it's five, six years old, like I remember my grandparents or you know, whoever was taking me to church, like I got into it. I was like, this is the answer. Like it's like what? What does God want you to do? Because when you're six, like it's, it's not a con. I remember thinking of it and there's a very narrow confined way, like I didn't have a broad sense of the world. I had a sense of God as being like the ultimate dad. Right? And then will the, well, this data that I have is failed. So there's ultimate dad. You've got to do what he says and that's how you, that's how life works. Good. And that's how you're happy. This very small vocabulary that I have this narrow view of the world with, you know, five summers of life experience. And then I went to Catholic school and I was like, Holy Shit, is this wrong?

Speaker 3:          01:22:08       I was like, this is so wrong. Sister Mary Josephine. This is the only person I remember from being six years old. I don't remember anybody's name, but I remember that fucking evil monster of a lady. She was horrible. And I remember thinking, she smelled like death. She looked like how she just looked like she was just in grief and anger and just annoyed all the time and was so mean to kids bat. And uh, it, it fucking knocked it right out of me, knocked it all right out of me, all my ideas about religion and Catholicism. And I was done by the time first grade was over. I was like, there's no way I'm going back. When my parents had run away. Wow. I was like, there's no fucking.

Speaker 2:          01:22:51       Yeah. My parents went to Catholic schools in the Bronx back when they just hit you. I mean, like every infraction, they had a room, literally they had the ruler out and they wrap you on the knuckles all the time. And My mother said to me, she realized she got older, these nuns that were teaching very often they became nuns because maybe they were lesbians, maybe they hated kids. They didn't want to go down that road. And so they joined the sisterhood to get away from it and they stuck him in fucking classrooms with 25 jacked up testosterone written kids. And it's their worst nightmare. That's why they're so miserable.

Speaker 1:          01:23:32       We got a kid in the neighborhood that became a priest and he was a nice kid. I was in high school. What? He's gay as fuck. Everybody knows gay as fuck. It was so obvious. He was just soft and this, his face was soft and, and he had no interest in women who's like, wow, there's gotta be a way. And he went right into the priesthood. We were, we started calling him father by the time he was 17. Wow. I guess he was 18. He was like a year older than us, maybe two years older than me. Um, and I think he had graduated and he was already like going into the priesthood. Right. I don't know what steps you have to take to do it, but people started calling. Father started calling him father when I was 16. I think people are doing it, but I remember thinking like, oh, he's gay, obviously he's gay. And now he's like, what are the options and fucking Newton, Massachusetts in 1983. That's going to do. Yeah. What's it going to do? You know, didn't know where to go. Became a fucking priest.

Speaker 2:          01:24:32       Do you think that priests in a rectory, which Latin derivative rectum visit now, do you think they're all fucking. I mean the precert mostly gay, they're not getting laid there. They've got what, 23 hours of downtime every day when they're not doing a to an a mass.

Speaker 1:          01:24:53       I want to know what percentage of them are pedophiles and what percentage of them were molested. So became pedophiles. It's, I mean, and people to get upset of this look, you can't get upset at it. It's like blowing tires on Nascar. It's real. Yeah. Okay. We'll. Tarzan don't always fail. You're right. They don't always fail, but they fail a lot. A lot of people lose tires. You know, a lot of people crash cars. It's just your, there's a giant history of sex offenders that become priests and molest kids. Like what are the, what are the numbers like if yet is it 10 percent? And we just hearing about. I mean if it was 10 percent of priests is still a lot of people getting molested, is it 30 percent? Was the number. It's not zero.

Speaker 2:          01:25:34       Well, what's disturbing isn't just that number, but the number of priests that know about it that don't say anything or then they even know about it and they shift them to another church. I mean the complicity of the church in dealing with this problem. It's a civil case. This is rape, this should be in the courts. Police should be brought to the church and they should be fingerprinted and put in jail, but instead we somehow say, you guys deal with it yourself. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:26:01       Yeah. You remember when Ratzinger had to leave? He had a quick, which is very rare, but it was because they wanted to try him for crimes against humanity like that. I was a fucking piece of shit. What he did was take priests that were molesting kids. It just move him and he moved this one priest, this the guy that became pope, right? Yes. He was in charge. He was a cardinal or whatever the fuck he was. Whatever the name is. Were you in Germany? Take these priests and move them to this new spot and I think it was in Arizona or New Mexico. I forget where it was. It was somewhere in the United States. I believe he moved this guy. We're like, well, send him over there. And the guy wound up raping 100 deaf kids. Christ. Yeah. What you hear about that and you're like, oh my God. He imagine your baby, your poor baby you can't hear and they go to this place and they can't hear anything and this priest sticking his dick in their ass and then her mouth and like now like this is God does God wants this. God wants this guy to do this to me.

Speaker 2:          01:27:07       And if there was a company where the CEO allow that to happen under his watch, nevermind facilitated it. If you were the head of the company and it happened, you would have to step down. Oh yeah, this guy got elevated.

Speaker 1:          01:27:20       Pope crazy. Well, they did it that way for so long. I mean there's so many digital or you ever see, hear no evil. It's a documentary about it. Now. I can't watch those. Documentaries are rough, man, there's, there's quite a few of them and I usually make it like 45 minutes into them where I'm just crying and I can handle it. Yeah. It's just. And here's the thing. Most of those guys who were perpetrators were victims at one point in their lives. Of course, 90 percent I would say fucking crazy. What had horrible, horrible system of, you know, not a system, but you know, repeating action in there.

Speaker 2:          01:27:59       And that's the thing about that, the way it spreads, you know, every time somebody molested they, you're creating, you're creating other predators.

Speaker 6:          01:28:10       No, no.

Speaker 1:          01:28:12       Oh, so crazy. Yeah, I don't.

Speaker 2:          01:28:20       We went, we went to a pretty cool church growing up and the priests were apparently, I found out later were all having affairs with women in town. Really? Yeah. This one guy, I won't say his name, say it. Father Mcdonough, that piece of shit. Not fucking a kid right now that are way better. That's the whole problem. Bang. And people's wives, you know, like we like eucharistic ministers, you know, like the eucharistic ministers are the people that go to church, but they're, they're so special that they can actually go give communion to people that are home homebound.

Speaker 1:          01:28:55       Oh.

Speaker 2:          01:28:57       So the pre, they were in the inner circle and the priest,

Speaker 4:          01:29:00       I have a little fair. So he would go over, like maybe grandma was bedridden. He'd go over, give her the service, then slip it to the daughter. How's call? No, that's not what he did.

Speaker 2:          01:29:17       It was like the people that were the ministers, they became close to the priest because they would have to go to him to get the, uh, the bread blessed. And then they will take it in like a takeout bag and they would deliver it to the people that were, um,

Speaker 4:          01:29:31       homeboy bedridden. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, they, those religions become so ingrained in people's behavior patterns that mean it becomes a part of the community. You can't be like, I'm fucking quit in the church. Like, what are you talking about, bobby? Yeah, right. We go to church on Sunday. The whole family goes, we got up on a Sunday, best on we'd go to church. He becomes a part of your, not just your life, but the way you socially interact with your friends and your loved ones. Get everybody together. It's like it's part of the Sunday bonding.

Speaker 2:          01:30:02       Oh, in your child being christened and getting their first communion. These are big like landmark moments in your kid's life. You know, if you think about it, like you get your communion around the time that you begin puberty, you know, they're all based on cycles of nature. You know, Jesus was born, uh, in reality in April, but according to the church, December 25th, which is right at the winter solstice when the north star, it's like, it's all built into nature. It's all pagan and its origins and all the ceremonies that you go through are tied into, you know, rites of passage and people's lives.

Speaker 4:          01:30:36       That's why it's so weird that like when they were trying to convert pagans during the Roman days, the, they're like, wow, you know, we do this thing, the winter solstice. It's like what a coincidence, a Jesus was born the same time and come on board, come on board.

Speaker 2:          01:30:52       Most of the pagan gods and, and, and most of the world religions, the Messiah was born during the winter solstice and there was a and many of them died and rose up in the, uh, in the spring, which is what the vernal equinox right around Easter always lands right around the vernal equinox.

Speaker 4:          01:31:09       Well, you got to think for those people back then, like everything was about the crops rising and gathering food and fertility and that was everything. Yeah. Everything was about whether or not you could make a baby whether or not you could feed your family. I mean, if the crops went bad, you had a late frost or something like that and things died. You were fucked. Yeah. Especially since you had 12 kids. No birth control shoot loads all willy nilly. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:31:35       Yeah. And you know, and it was a, it was a sin for a woman to say, now you had to do it. I mean, you look at you really. I'll fuck. Yeah. With the Catholic church, you can't say no to your husband.

Speaker 4:          01:31:45       Really? No Way, man. It's a crime to sin. You can go to the priest and complain about it on the priests. Go give up the posts. That's right. Well, yeah. No, no birth control either. That's the other thing that's crazy. Like,

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       hey, you don't. Well, you got to create Christian soldiers. That's what. That's where these rules came from is that it was about populating with his many of our guys as possible so they don't want to limit you having kids. Well, there was no birth control at the time. I mean back when that was all going on, but you can pull out and come in and girls face legally

Speaker 3:          01:32:24       it's mandatory and so when you think about like birth control today, I think it's great that people have the option for birth control 100 percent and I'm not anti birth control. I think it's amazing, but it's very weird for a girl to have hormones in her body that are artificially put in there, that tricker body into thinking it's pregnant. Yeah. And they go through this whole cycle of it and what's really fascinating is women lose their ability to discern certain smells that they get from men, whether or not a man is compatible, like they've done these studies where they took women on birth control and off birth control, and they could smell men's clothes like a woman off birth control can smell a man's clothes, just know anything about them and can. This can discern whether or not she'd be attracted to him certain days. Certain degree of success. Yeah, but that's out the window. As soon as they're on the pill, when they're on the pill, they just. Their bodies all confused. They're pregnant and they're not thinking about that. And so they lose this sort of weird sense of compatibility.

Speaker 2:          01:33:25       Wow. Yeah. This was. They start responding only to axe body spray, smell dating. What is this the first time? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:33:32       mall order mail order dating service. Is that real? Like. Yeah. You like mail a shirt in and hilarious. I send you a tee shirt. You wear this shirt for three days and three nights without deodorant you return a shirt to us. In a prepaid envelope, we send you swatches of t shirts worn by a selection of other individuals. You smell the samples and tell us who you like. Someone has a smell you like, likes the smell of Youtube. We facilitate and exchange contact information. The rest is up to you.

Speaker 2:          01:34:03       Wow. I'll tell you what, my wife, I remember like the first date I had with my wife, we rode. We rode our bikes over the Brooklyn Bridge and we. It was, it was a hot summer day and then we fooled around a little bit and I remember smelling her and fucking being so aroused. It was like to this day her smell turns me on. Yeah. People are compatible with each other and in smells. It's real. That's legit. It's a very strange thing though, right? We'll look at every. Every fucking animal. Smells actually watched this planet earth a special and it was about a, I forget which kind of wild cat it was, but they go, they travel for like hundreds of miles and there's certain rocks that they know to rub their backs up against and leave an odor

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       and the other one's in the territory go to that same rock and they smell it and they rub on it and then they decide who to mate with based on these, like a specific tree or a rock that are like miles away from each other.

Speaker 6:          01:35:10       Wow. Wow. Huh.

Speaker 4:          01:35:15       That's crazy. It's really crazy. When you think about how an animal has a sense, like their sense of smell is like almost like we don't have a sense of smell, like what they can. They can smell fear and adrenaline. They can. They can smell all kinds of weird shit. They can smell animals from hundreds of yards away. The wind blows up like they can smell shit that we don't have a goddamn chance of smelling. There's no way. Smelling is so fucking weird. I was in my car on the 10 freeway the other day and there was a small fire on the west side. I was seven miles away, windows up and I could smell smoke and you really think about physically, how the fuck did that sent traveled that far through my car and into my nose. What? What's crazy? Skunks. Yeah, right. They say skunks give you a sense of how an animal smells because the parts per million of skunk smell that you can pick up is a lot like how a dog could pick up the smell of like a robber.

Speaker 4:          01:36:16       When they give a dog a t shirt, like there he goes, go get them, boy. And they run around like that. That's apparently very similar. Very similar. Like when you smell a skunk, like you could smell skunk and you're like, oh, it's over to the right. Like you know where it is so weird. Like you could be on the street. You're like, oh, you're fucking smell that. And you'd go like that to the left. You go like that to the right and you're like, oh, it's over this way. You can. You could smell skunk from blocks away, blocks, I mean, imagine a smell that you could smell from blocks away and it comes out of an animal the size of a football. Yeah, that's crazy. All right. It's not a lot of sense. This is a little bit of a spray. That's like if you took a hairspray can and just held it down for two seconds.

Speaker 4:          01:36:55       Like Shit. That's what a skunk sprays. Yeah. I get it. Sprayed once. Did you? Yeah. We were in Newport, Rhode Island. We had this house and it was, it was a converted, a horse stable. So there was just a, it was, it was 21 of us living in the house one summer and there were people literally they were stables that had cots in them and people slept in those. And I think there was like three bathrooms in the entire place. And so, uh, there were skunks, skunks that lived in the basement of the house and the house just smelled like skunks. And then one night I hear this clunking out in the garage. It's like clunk, clunk, and I opened the door and I walk out and there's a skunk and he's got his head jammed in as small hellman's mayonnaise jar and he's trying to bang his head on the ground to get it off.

Speaker 4:          01:37:45       Wow. And I felt so bad for the thing that I got. There was a golf club in the corner and I got the golf club and went over and I, I hit, I hit the, uh, the glass trying to break it off. Oh, Jesus. And the skunk squirted me and then ran outside and disappeared and I don't know if he fucking died or whatever, but that shit stayed on me for days. Yeah. My dog got hit when I was in Boston. He got hit or she got hit. It was a girl dark. She got hit and I watched her in tomato juice close to use. It didn't work and it kind of worked, but it didn't really work. She smell like shit for days, days, just forever. Yeah. I don't know how he even wears off, you know? Yeah. I guess it's a, it's a weird defense mechanism, you know? Very weird, you know, they got the big stripes, you associate them with the smell and you stay article about it. So alcohol file thing. Here's the. I was actually reading the part about tomato juice. Won't work. Tomato juice

Speaker 3:          01:38:45       do it. It's just a strong smell that attempts to cover up the smell of skunk. What you need is a chemical that will change the composition of the thiol group. Fortunately baking soda and hydrogen peroxide or cheap mild, and we'll do the job. Interesting. So baking soda and Hydrogen Peroxide. Mild oxidizing agents, meaning they will attacks, attach oxygen atoms to the sulfur atom. And the thiol pairing and takeaway its ability to stink. Interesting. And water makes it worse too. Apparently the chemicals are flammable. So under the right conditions we can have a little stripe flame throwers run around the woods. Wow. Take a skunk. You fucking forced them to spray and you just hold a lighter up to his asshole.

Speaker 4:          01:39:34       I think he got a new marvel, a character skunk man. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:39:38       that's crazy that it's an alcohol based spray coming out of an animal. Yeah. And it's also like, how the fuck does something evolve to spray shit. I now get of all the different possible things that could have happened through natural selection. A skunk is one of the weirder ones. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:39:57       Is there flowers to do that? Is there a stink that's spray? There's flowers that do think that when they opened they smell. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. I think that is a flower that is a trap for rats. The rats. It smells like rotten. Real. Yeah. Yeah. You know how there's like a Venus flytrap, there's also one that attracts rodents and it opens up and it smells like rotten meat and they fall in it and it just closes up on them and they can't get out. Jesus might not close up on them. They might not be able to climb out of it. It's like a metaphor for marriage

Speaker 7:          01:40:36       right after you get to this day. I love the smell of my wife,

Speaker 4:          01:40:42       but I can't get out.

Speaker 3:          01:40:44       If you could find that thing of a. of a plant that eats mice. Yeah. There it is. Newly discovered carnivorous jungle plant. Gobbles rats.

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       Whole who? That poor fucking rat maze a fuck bro. I'm fucking here. I think. Fuck it. I'm going to plant fucking plants. Got Me Bro. Deep in the jungle. Prime evil. What is, how do you say that name? Nip. Nip. And the nip in this actin Oggie with two eyes awaits. It's furry. Pray. It's not a stuffy cat or poisonous lizard. It's a plant. And each rats, uh, it's been named after the famous naturalist and TV personality, Sir David Attenborough. Me Eating pitcher plants their pitcher. Plants discovered by science and time of, I don't know who has is eating plan. That's insane. For an unlucky mouse or bird became a meal. It was a rare treat, but this one is a vertebrate specialist. So there are some that eat insects and spiders, but an unlucky mouse or a bird is rare. But these fucking plants, this giant plant is a specialist in rats.

Speaker 1:          01:41:59       They lure rats with the promise of sweet nectar, but when the rat leans into the plant that drink the saccharin liquid, it slips on the pitcher's waxy interior and get stuck. And it's gooey sap. Once it's trapped, acid, like digestive enzymes, break down the still living road and up. Come on. How the fuck does that happen? To better explain the whole process as well as the life cycle of pitcher plant. There's a video by a David Attenborough, the poisonous pitcher plant. You could find that the private life of plants. Plants are so fucking complicated. Yeah. It's so. It's so fascinating that just develop like that's one of the real gigantic problems that people have with the deforestation of the rain forest. Is their stuff down there that we haven't even figured out yet? Yeah. Is so little of it has been explored. Did you see that new thing in Guatemala where they're going through the jungle and they found thousands.

Speaker 1:          01:42:53       They have some new technology where they can like see like sonar ushers. Yeah, and they found thousands of unknown structures like, like building cities. Like right. There used to be a thriving, some sort of a thriving community in there. He had and they say that it, it proves, it disproves a lot of theories about were things that developed, at what rate they were so far beyond what we thought they were in terms of irrigation and things like that where you met. I mean it's so weird because we only lived to be 80, 90 years old. Right. And in that time you barely have enough time to figure out what the fuck you're doing your own life and you're like, Hey, what's that stone wall over there? It's always been here like nobody knows. I've been out of the ancient ones. Dancer wants made it and then you die. And then your grandchildren here the same story. Oh the ancient ones. They built that wall and then someone comes along and like 1990 and goes, hey, who the fuck are the ancient ones? Yeah. Like let's start doing some digs if thank God for archaeologists and all these people that are out there with toothbrushes, cargo

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       shorts, with a fucking toothbrush for

Speaker 3:          01:43:54       days to scrape and things. Trying to find little bits of pottery and shit.

Speaker 2:          01:43:59       Did you see the new radio lab that came out last week? No, I did not. Marty plants. Oh Wow. That's going to freak you out. There's. It's only 30 minutes long. It's a really easy listen, but there's a couple cool, cool, cool story to tell. Like plants might have memory

Speaker 3:          01:44:12       for instance, and this sort of data. They definitely know that they communicate. They allocate resources to the more needy. Amongst them, they have some sort of a symbiotic relationship with fungi. Were they the fungi? The microrisal relationship between certain plants and fungus. The plants in the fungus, like exchange nutrients, you know, fungus actually breathes air that they breathe air and exhale carbon dioxide like an animal, and then plants breathe carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen. Huh? Fuck. It's madness, man. Yeah, there they are. Plants are a life form and we have this thing in our head because they don't move all. They must be stupid, but there are in some way communicating with each other in a method that we don't totally understand. Yeah. Which fucks vegans hard. That whole self righteousness and all the craziness that comes along with being a Vegan and cruelty free, not to those screaming plants that you can't hear because they scream, they fucking scream.

Speaker 3:          01:45:17       Yeah. They make noise like the end. They know when they're being eaten. That's one of the weirdest things. Like when they. Not only do they know when they're being eaten, if you place sounds of a caterpillar eating leaves next to a tree, some trees change the composition of the tastes structure of the way the plants taste to animals. They becoming in the like, what's the word? Uh, unpalatable. They taste disgusting. They're inevitable. Like, so these giraffes starve to death because upwind, certain drafts will be eating and then the wind comes down and through either a smell or sound or some method of transportation that we, or transmission that we're not totally aware of. Everything down when is changing its flavor and it becomes disgusting to the drafts. Wow, that's fucking nuts, man. It's amazing. They're like, someone's eating us. Fuck it. What's crazy is it's not just something biting into it. It's the actual sound of it. The sound of it triggers.

Speaker 2:          01:46:19       Okay, that's fine. Uh, one of the things that talk about is Dave, that's how they find water. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I've read about that.

Speaker 3:          01:46:26       They, they hear the sound of water and they grow towards it. What's crazy is they've played recordings of the sound of water and plants grow towards the recordings.

Speaker 2:          01:46:38       So what the fuck is going on with those things? So they have auditory canals and some said the roots have a very similar hair follicle like we have in our ear, which is you actually hear you here. You're picking up vibrations on the hairs and that's what their roots are made up of. Tons and tons of tiny little fiber. Like heres that become a root fuck. It's amazing. And the difference is if I eat an animal, it's been killed and I'm eating the dead flesh theory and a salad. Some of that Shit's still alive.

Speaker 1:          01:47:07       Yeah. Maybe that's okay. Maybe it's okay. I mean, here's the thing, maybe it's all okay, but we have this idea that some life is more important than other labs. That intelligent life is more important than non-intelligent life. Right.

Speaker 2:          01:47:23       I know they did this whole thing with the Olympics about how, how many dislike 2000 dog, a farms in South Korea where they breed dogs for eating and you go there and it's like they're just regular fucking dogs. A whole variety like you would see in a pet store and you know, and we were outraged by it and we've sent out, you know, there's people that fly over from the states and they adopt one pet. Meanwhile there's like hundreds of thousands and you get maybe 50 rich Americans come over and adopt a pet and bring it back. I rescued her, I rescued her from a Korean factory. They made burgers out of her. Yeah. But that's weird. I mean for some people a dog is food and a. well, what does that Jamie, you know, pigs are like one of the most intelligent animals.

Speaker 1:          01:48:10       What does that. That's a dog farm to rows. Cages that will be used for dogs. Oh my God. Yeah. But meanwhile those chickens, I wouldn't give a fuck billard well I don't like that. They have to live like that, but I like chicken so

Speaker 2:          01:48:25       he ever like stop and go. You're in the middle of eating chicken and ego. This is five meals in a row that I've eaten a fucking chicken eggs. Yeah. It's crazy how much of those hormones I must have in my body.

Speaker 1:          01:48:37       There's a big misconception about that. Yeah. Most chickens that you're eating don't have hormones in them. Hormones are expensive and you don't have to give the chickens hormones. The hormones that the. The idea is that you give a chicken hormone. That's why they're so big, but now they're so big through selective breeding. They've essentially like if you take that girl with giant tits and you breeder with a guy whose mom has giant tits and everybody gets together and then you have just a giant tip family. That's essentially what they've done with these chickens. They figured out a way to breathe. These chickens were. They have preposterously large breasts and they can't walk. Sometimes. They're all fucked up. Yeah. They're not like a regular, like the chickens I have in my yard. They run around, they jump up in there and they fly a couple of steps. There are normal checks, so they're flat chested. They're, yeah, they're like little, uh, gymnastics chickens as opposed to a stripper chickens. You want to get some stripper chickens with double e fake tits that can crush beer cans. Ever seen those gals and they hold a beer. Can they take one of their whoppers and they just smashed that beer can with them dinner. We'll have glitter on the chicken and she's got a backstory.

Speaker 1:          01:49:42       Why third dollar bill inside the chicken? Yeah. So when you think that you're getting hormones from

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       food, most likely that's not the case, but it's highly likely that, especially with beef, especially corn fed beef, you're getting antibiotics because they get sick, so you're most likely not getting hormones, but there's some hormones in the animal themselves and there's a certain amount of selective breeding that I'm sure would have more homework hormones than less, which would encourage the animals to have like larger bodies and develop more food. But I think for the most part the largeness is due to their diet. Like if you take a cow and you feed it grass, it takes much longer than for them to reach the size that they would like the cow to reach before they butcher it. But if you feed them corn, they fattened up real quick. And then obviously the, there's extremes like that. Why Goose Shit and Coby coby before you get. It's just literally a dying animal.

Speaker 3:          01:50:42       It's filled with fat. You ever get those things? Yeah. It's like if Mike Sullivan Irwin was a cow. It's. Sorry, Mike, rest in peace. God bless you. He's up there. Um, this, this cow is essentially like they've just given this guy this terrible diet and they fat all over their body but, and no exercise and even massage them, I think. Yeah, I think they do in Japan that's like part of the deal they did. They give them beer and then they massage them. Is there a happy ending? No, because their steers. So if their steers it means they don't have any balls. Know a steer is they take a bull, like cut his balls off. And that's what a steer is. Most of the time when you're buying, if you buy ground beef, I think, I hope I'm not wrong with this, but I think sometimes ground beef is a cow, like a female and um, they like maybe they stopped producing milk or they get to a certain age and they shoot them and then they grind them up.

Speaker 3:          01:51:37       But if you buy steaks like USD, a prime t bone, you know, nice t bone steak that's coming from a steer. So that's a cow that cut his balls off and then they, they fatten them up, huh? Didn't know that ground beef is the, uh, the cow sometimes think ground beef sometimes can be steered to like certain cuts. But I think in some cases, I hope I'm not wrong about this, but I do know that most of the stakes you get if you buy like a nice rib eye or something like that, you're getting it from a steer. Isn't there also some chemical that's released, they say when they slaughter beef that they get scared. Adrenaline, it then that you're eating some kind of a chemical sometimes as a result? Well, there is a definite taste that people think happens to an animal when they're scared. Um, and you, if you shoot an animal and it's wounded and it scared and maybe you have to follow up with a second shot or something like that, that animal will not taste as good as an animal that has no idea what hit it. Yeah. That's why I'm. There's a guy that I know that's a chef of a very famous San Francisco restaurant say song. I think it is. I think that's the name of it. It was on my friend Steve [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:52:46       podcast. Steve Rinella has a podcast called meat eater and he's a pretty famous hunter and chef himself. But one of the things that, this chef of this, uh, this like one of the very few Michelin Blah Blah Blah stars, I don't know how many fucking Michelin Stars and ask, but it's like very, very highly rated restaurant. He shoots the animals in the head only, like when he goes hunting, he's hunting and he only shoots them in the head. So he has to have like a close shot with a very accurate rifle. Shoots him in the head so they die instantly. They have no idea what happened. Boom. They're dead, no adrenaline dump, nothing. And then that way, according to him, you get the finest flavor from the food. Wow. Yeah. That's a harder shot to because that's the thing that's moving the most on the animal. The head could be.

Speaker 1:          01:53:31       I mean it could just be sitting there eating like a lot of times they're eating grass or something like that. I mean this is obviously we're talking about wild animals, you know, it'd be really easy to do for a cow or something like that. They would have no idea. They're just sitting there eating. You could set up on a bench with a rifle and just take them out and they would have no idea, but most of the time with cows, they use that cattle rod on that brain that that guy used in no country for old men from that dude come around with that and he put it on people's heads and punk. Yeah. That's how they. They killed cows. They're being corralled into the, into the slaughterhouse and they know what's happening. They know something's not good. Yeah. I don't think they know exactly what it is, but they definitely think they're fucking hell.

Speaker 1:          01:54:11       I think if plants can tell that a giraffe is eating from a mile away, I think cows can tell that they're. There is a killing field right in front of them. You know the worship is kosher ally. The way they do it. I don't know about this. Slice their neck and the bleed out and then they hang them up by their ankles and flopping around bleeding. It's terrible. Cows. Cows. Yeah. When you buy kosher beef, there's a very specific ritual that has to be gone through. That has to be accomplished. In order to proclaim beef kosher, it has to be a very sharp knife and I believe it all has to be done by a rabbi Steve. That's true. Damn. Yeah, but I've watched it. I've watched in videos and it's like, okay, this is terrible, but kosher hot dogs. Pretty good. They're delicious. They're the best.

Speaker 1:          01:55:02       They really are. I mean, it's like it's. It's like two different types of food. There's kosher hot dogs and they're shitty hot dogs. Think Kosher also in it. It has to be hormone free, it has to be antibiotics free and I think they have to be on a specific diet, doesn't have a bunch of things. Regular hot dogs. They put the fucking beaks and the fee, everything. Assholes, dicks and I think with kosher that they don't put all that shit in there. Maybe that would make sense. Hotdog in a while. Yeah. Well good fucking New York City hot dog. It's hard. Some onions on there are some relevant you put on your hot dog. I'm a big Sauerkraut guy. Sally Brown. Spicy mustard. Yeah. I love that. Come. I like gray's

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Papaya on sixth avenue. That's a good spot. You get two dogs and the Papaya drink for like $3 it's bought. Yeah. Yeah. That's an interesting place to. It's like probably hasn't changed much since the beginning of time. No. As a matter of fact, I know a gray. Sheila Gray is the granddaughter of the Guy who started them and the guy who started them was a famous Broadway producer who'd won Tony Awards for some of the shows that he made, and then he used the money to buy first, the one on sixth avenue and then he opened up another one up on 72nd and Broadway. There's another gray's Papaya and uh, she's a great acting teacher. I went to her, she's a coach and I used to go to her classes and then I went in one time for a private session at our apartment and uh, when I was coming out she was like, you gotta go, you gotta go. It's like a rush job. I'm like, what the fuck? And I walk out and Mariah Carey standing there waiting to come in and get coached. Right. Carriers take an ironman was a weird transition, right? Like it's a normal transition for comic to become an actor or a singer. I now it's like, Huh, alright, rappers can do it. No problem. Rappers seemed to be make they make this transition. Yeah. Twelve years now tonight's show Tupac to the gangways. Yeah. Big. He never did a movie though, did he? Nope. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:57:04       Interesting. Yeah, he's my favorite. He's my favorite of all time. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:57:09       Uh, only one who is knowledgeable in the laws of slaughtering. Know what does that Word Sha, she wears red when we need them. Call them up on his flip phone. S h e e h I t a h shit say shit. Shahita and proficient in its practice. And who is a believing pious Jew may act as the slaughterer show het in performance of the commandment. It is the prevalent custom that this show hat must receive written authorization from a recognized Rabbinical Authority attesting to the aforesaid qualifications. Okay, so you have to. You have to have written authorization from a rabbi saying that you know what you're doing the shit to a must be done by means of a swift smooth cut of a sharp knife who's blade is free of any dent or imperfection. Wow. The Shit Shea, he's probably screaming at us. Her sugars entails severing the trachea and Esophagus in according with the oral tradition, which requires that five improper procedures be avoided less. They invalidate that Shahita and render the animal unfit to be eaten. Wow. There a hesitation or delay while drawing the knife. If you hesitate. Oh No. Oh, it's all over. Don't eat the cow. Excessive pressure or chopping. You can't eat it. Burrowing

Speaker 4:          01:58:42       the knife between the trachea and the esophagus or under the skin. You can't eat it. Diy, making the incision outside the specific area. You can't eat it and he laceration or tearing of the trachea or Esophagus, which would result from an imperfect blade. An animal or foul that has been improperly slaughtered or as already noted that is not slaughtered but dies of itself is considered carrion. Nevada. Huh? An unfit for food. God, they're picky. That's so picky. It is forbidden to slaughter the parent with its young on the same day. It's in leviticus 20 to 28. Leviticus set some hard core shift. Yeah. Yeah. That's a hardcore book of the Bible. That's the quote from pulp fiction that, uh, that uh, Sam pond, the what great veterinarians and furious anger Zico is that you from a few kilos. A weird to like [inaudible] the one that the Ufo dorks always point to because Zika equal, um, had some sort of a vision of a wheel within a wheel, like some sort of vision that they, they think was some visitor from outer space.

Speaker 4:          01:59:57       Oh, no shit. Wow. I think they were tripping. I think they're just eating mushrooms. That's what I think. Well, yeah. Well the last book, the, uh, about the uh, Armageddon. That's fucking trippy. That's a bad trip. Wrote it all down. Well they say that the, I forget who wrote the book of revelations, but they say that it occurred at the same time as the, uh, pompei exploded and that he was really just describing what was happening really in Italy when this pump, hey, I want to feel like I feel like 100 or something add. Yeah. Right. Well, most of the Bible wasn't written until two or 300 years. Testament. Yeah. Well, but a lot of it was like older stories that they had to pick and choose what to keep. Yeah. There it goes. Seventy nine, 79 in the summer around August 24th, 25th. Probably visited. Did you go there when you went to Italy?

Speaker 4:          02:00:53       I did not plan. It was pretty wild. Yeah, I did not. I was having such a good time in Ravello. I just stayed up there. And [inaudible] posten swam. Yeah. Is that on the uh, the uh, mafi coast mouth because yeah, we went to Ravello which is up high and then we went to Moffitt coast, which is down low. Yeah. And then we went to Capri, went to the aisle. Oh, you did? I hear that. That boat ride is a little crowded though. It's not the best. It's just you just deal with it. You get to the island, you have awesome fish and seafood. The fucking food there. It's just so amazing. Yeah. Yeah. I throw all my dietary restrictions out the goddamn window. If I go to Italy somehow they don't get fat. I mean, you're in Italy and these people are eating pasta and cheese and wine and they just seemed get a little launch,

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       but that's about it. Yeah. Well they walked there was crazy. Is that. I also think that they're dealing with heirloom wheat. Wheat is a different kind of wheat and it's uh, you know, the wheat that we have today and someone corrected me on this. Um, I guess I use the wrong term when I said genetically modified. It has been modified, but it's been modified to traditional agricultural methods of splicing and you know, how the fuck they did it. It's not like it was done with a dude in a lab coat. Yeah. But nonetheless, the wheat that you get today is very different than the wheat of say, 200 years ago that we'd have 200 years ago. It was a small plant. It didn't have a high yield. And now when they, what they've done through this selective breeding is create this really thick heavy wheat that has a lot of complex glutens.

Speaker 1:          02:02:26       And that's one of the reasons why so many people have gluten sensitivity today. It's just a more complex thing for your body digest. So if you're eating fucking wonder bread and shit and all that stuff is just sitting in your gut like that feeling, that's what it feels like, right? When you have a big fucking bowl of pasta, you feel like there's like because that's what your body's doing, your body's trying to compress and digested and what do we do with all this stuff? So this fucking glue, this asshole just ate. He just ate paste. Not only that, but why is it with pasta they give you like it's the size of your head. Do I need that much of this shit? There's no other meal. They give you that quantity of oil. They used to be a restaurant in Santa Monica called Il Grano and it's done.

Speaker 1:          02:03:12       It's done now. It went, it went under, but when it first opened it was fucking amazing. And callen took me there and we ate there and we had squid ink pasta and they would give you like it was a multi course meal where they'd give you like a plate of this and play that in. Every plate was about the size of your fist. Everything was fairly small. That's it right there. Woo. That shit was good. That's got um, sea urchin on top of it, which is amazing. But squid ink pasta, stuff that we had had a crab, it had dungeness crab and squinting pasta. To this day, I think about it, it's like one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my life. But small portion and not the size of your fucking head, right? Yeah. He forgot to cheesecake factory. The other fat people eat traits, you know, it's the worst book.

Speaker 1:          02:04:02       Epo or the best depending on if you want. I used to work there. Oh they did in Columbus, they give you a goddamn bathtub full of Pasta, family style. So it's not for one person, but yeah, misconception they get crazy though. They give you like a Rigatoni with meat sauce and cheese and you're like, Holy Shit. Yeah. Who the fuck is eating all this? But if you're, if you just want a gorge, he just want to go deep. It's amazing. You know Lasagna big fucking trail is on all four knows my oh dude. Pizza and Pasta. Woo. That

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       was one of my favorite trump stories. The trump story about the pizza with little pizzas on top of it to verify that that was. That's what he was eating. One of the stories of one of his mistresses. That's one of the things that she said is that he ordered a pizza, but for the toppings you want little pizzas on the pizza.

Speaker 4:          02:05:00       I don't know if that's not real, but that just like him. He also got shit for when he was in New York and he was running. He ate a pizza with a knife and a fork and he got a ton of shit about that. Maybe doesn't get his hands dirty at satire. It is outside. I mean it sounded so fake that it sounds so good though. That's great. Sounds so good. That is something that someone should make pizzas a little pizzas as topping. That's real. The trump, the trump part of it was fake like him saying, oh, but there is really pizzas with little pizzas on top of that. Some restaurant. I don't even want it. I'll show you what. I don't want it, but I. I want to be there when it gets made. Well, what is it that they stuff in the crust, if pizzas now look at that.

Speaker 4:          02:05:42       It's a pizza with little pizzas on top of it. Wow. That actually looks delicious. Oh, and it's a bunch of different kinds of pizzas on top of it. I like Pizza Hut. Got Better. Did it not pizza at Domino's. Did it? Domino's used to fucking suck really? But now it's like decent pizza. Wow. Paid for by dominoes. All right. When was the last time you had it? A couple of months ago was a bad. It wasn't bad. Yeah. I mean, I hate to sound like every other New Yorker, but it really is. It's hard to find pizza out here in la. It's decent. It's the water, right? That's what everybody says so. But has anybody made a real pizza where they took the water from New York and brought it over here? Can you steal water from New York and bring it to a business in la? Can you just like open up a fucking faucet?

Speaker 4:          02:06:30       Philip jugs? We need it. We're going dry again. I love it. We had a drought last year that was so devastating that it was all anybody talked about and we got, what do we get a month of rain, and then they just said, okay, all restrictions are off now, and our course, six months later they're like, oh, we got another drought coming. It's like, how about we just don't take fucking 20 minute showers permanently. Yeah, but they feel good and you're not going to live forever, so yeah, fuck all these people. Get your water from Portland. Yeah. Just put a pipe up in Seattle and bring that God damn water down here. That's what was happening during the drought. When, uh, what's the, what's the rich town up by Santa Barbara? Mendocino, Montecito on a cdot with Oprah and all these people. Apparently they were bringing in so many tankers fill a water to water their grass that it was like damaging the streets of Montecito and the other citizens were complaining about the tankers that were coming to the tankers were fucking up the road.

Speaker 4:          02:07:26       That's a. There are some rich fucking people up there. There's a house that I saw that was up there for sale for $85,000,000. No Shit. Imagine how a baller you have to be to spend $85,000,000 and pay the taxes and the maintenance on it. Oh yeah. Every month. Yeah. Yeah. How about your mortgage? What's your mortgage on $85,000,000 house? Well, I'll say it's like $150,000 a month as a million dollars. Million dollars of cost. You about $4,000 a month. Here we go. So Barbara, $85,000,000. Estimated mortgage, 343,000. Two hundred $95 a month. Yeah, that's the house. Look at that fucking house though. That is crazy. I mean who lives there? Jay Z does Jay Jay z by that house. He can buy it. I bought one for like 80 or something in Bel Air. Hollow. 12 bedrooms, 13 bass. But that you paid all that money. I would have to spend time in my house all the time. I wouldn't go anywhere. You would feel like that unless you were worth billions of dollars. If you are worth billions of dollars, you wouldn't give a fuck at. They have like a horse if they have a heliport. Oh, for sure. They probably have like a time machine.

Speaker 4:          02:08:42       They probably all kinds of crazy shit. Yeah. Nineteen 31. Wow. Well there's a lot of that up there, you know, they built it up there, that sort of model Italy. There's a lot of Italians that live up there and that's why it has an Italian name and there's a lot of like really legit Italian restaurants. Yeah, it's the same climate. Dry, mountainous on the ocean. Yeah. They grow out of wine up there too. Yeah, I was up there. I saw Lucille Ball. She was at a, uh, at a restaurant. You saw Lucille Ball Shit. Oh, I'm sorry. Carol Burnett now. Wendy Lucille ball died. She died like a long time ago. Right. Carol Burnett, Carol Carolyn. That's still alive. I saw Carol Burnett. She's having her little comeback now. Fishing. Well, they had like the 50th anniversary of her shell and so they did a big one hour special on TV. That was fucking great.

Speaker 4:          02:09:31       I watched them. I Love Lucy. The other day I watched him on youtube and I was like, wow. Or somewhere online. I was like, wow, this is crazy. It's such a time machine. It's such a weird. Yeah, I mean it was so like, it was like a play. I feel like there was one camera just shooting them flat the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. Just wide shots of the whole room critique about like what I think about is like how today sitcoms are all everybody's young and gorgeous and then you go back to shows like that and you go look at the murder cases the fucking 57 years old. Back then everybody looked like they were all, even when they weren't. Yeah. Yeah. Look at that. Look at the Mertz is. Yeah. Wow. And he was crazy. Everybody who was Desi Arnaz oh, how could he not be big star? It was actually really sad. She had a booming career and then she wanted to spend time with him and get him involved. So they started desi lou productions and I think they

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       were the first talent to create their own studio for their show. So they could own it and so he was, you know, he was the executive on the show like she was and she created this whole world for them to be together and then he just fucked. Everybody knows what they did back then. Especially back then

Speaker 1:          02:10:54       probably nobody knew what a star was. A new thing.

Speaker 2:          02:10:57       Right?

Speaker 1:          02:10:58       Right. W Like I played this video yesterday, Jamie sent me, I put it on my instagram of Elvis doing karate and it's a crazy video and you watch elvis do this nonsense karate and he's so obviously pilled out of his mind. So obviously high that you're, what? You're watching it, you're thinking we're not playing this right. What, when you don't even play the volume, but what? So when you're watching this and Elvis is going through all this, you realized that with this guy was one of the very first real superstars. There was no roadmap. How, how this guy learned how to behave.

Speaker 2:          02:11:35       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:11:37       I mean, look at him. He's smiling high as a kite. Now check this out. Look at this. Karate stay guys is laying on the ground, stomps on his stomach, goes nita belly. That's legit, and look at this clause, the eyes and the mouth at the same time, and then they're like, okay, you're done. He's like, no, no man. I got some. A little ideas. Hold on, hold on. Puts his hand up. Nope.

Speaker 2:          02:11:57       Watches.

Speaker 8:          02:11:58       Stay close. Look at it. Some cry, cry moves. I'm doing all over a bunch of karate when he does all this crazy karate shit and then it helps them up. You Go, I got a bread built better than a black belt.

Speaker 1:          02:12:12       Look at this. The guy throws a punch. Steps aside, I'm going to step to the side. Throw a karate kick. Wow. It's disarming things in that video too that are pretty funny. Long video. It's amazing because all my life I had always heard. Yeah, Elvis was a black belt under ed parker because Ed Parker when I was a kid who a legitimate karate instructor, like everybody knew who Ed Parker in Los Angeles. Boy, that's a good question. I do not know where he was originally, but I know he had. I believe he had places all over the country.

Speaker 2:          02:12:44       Well, your guy, he grew up,

Speaker 1:          02:12:47       he grew up out here. Yeah, he. He went to, but I think Ed Parker had a chain, like. Do you remember when we were living in Boston? There was Fred [inaudible]. Do you remember Fred Velardes karate studios that Fred Volare selfdefence studios. They were everywhere. They were everywhere. They're all over the place and what they've basically done is figured out how to teach karate in like a digestible form that families could go to and it just became this big business. But Ed Parker was thought of as like super legit. Like that was one of the guys. Like there's a few guys, you know those American karate people. There's American martial arts people. Is Dan Inosanto. There was, you know Bob Wall. There was Ed Parker, like he was a legit guy and I always thought that Elvis was legit. I was. I'd never seen until that video. I'd only seen like a couple of things.

Speaker 1:          02:13:35       I came on stage throwing kicks and the punches at the end is the craziest because they're nowhere near the guy's head. I lego's hands are taped up to go take her hands up, man. I'm going to make sure this guy's going to throw a kick. I'm gonna show you go ahead and try it again. Look, he's got a fucking shirt with a collar on underneath his karate gate. Look at that. Fucking karate chops up and then walks away. Walk away. Walk away. Elvis Presley. What does it say? Gladiators project 1974. Where does God come on out now? We'll just grab your arm and that guy. He's like a real karate guys. Like this is bullshit. Look, he's calling it the hands. Oh, he's a head a head. Ah, Yangon. Oh elbow man. I'm getting right here. Hit him in the back. He's like making shit up as he goes along.

Speaker 1:          02:14:23       I'm all elbow and right elbow. He's got a gun. Fuck that gun. I'm a karate you. Wow. But that guy, I mean the, the level of fame that he had achieved was unfathomable. I mean, no one, no one. No one had any idea what that was. And then Michael Jackson fantasy. I mean he know marrying. How old is Priscilla? 14 or that she was very young and just, Oh, y'all right here. My Alma, chop your ear. I'm going to get behind them because a lot of people lay behind you when they're attacking you. Get behind them. I'm just ill will in the back. Okay. I'll come out your with Doug. Palm strike to the head. Try to get me with a gun. Good look. Good luck on pills. He was on pills for a long time. He's on pills right now. Look at that. Look at this.

Speaker 1:          02:15:15       Come over here. He's got a gun. But uh, I don't give a fuck. [inaudible] they're gonna gum up my hand and he's going to stay put. I'll get my hand. Come on. Peanut burn blendle sandwich. There's no way. He didn't accidentally punched those guys in the face. Constantly going probably to it. They're probably mad at him. Just kept taking it. Well that's the thing about like karate, there was, there's always been bullshit karate back black belts and they can kind of get away with it because most of the time you don't really spar and when you do spar you kind of like take it light and you're like, ah, I could have got you right there. Like you do a bunch of that stuff. Like I always saw a lot of that. He can't, that doesn't happen with Jujitsu. Jujitsu because you can kind of do it full blast.

Speaker 1:          02:15:58       Like karate can't really. You can, but it's not, it's not wise and you can't do it very long. If you full blast, punch and kick each other, you wind up hurting everybody. Everybody's going to get fucked up. Right. Including you, um, because you're, you're, you would be fighting like fist fighting all the time. But with Jujitsu, because of the fact that you roll, meaning you spar, but that sparring does not involve striking and you could tap out when you're in a bad position, you could literally go full blast. So you really find out people that are good. So there's very, very few fake Jujitsu,

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       black belts, but occasionally there are some and they get outdated and there's some hilarious videos online of guys getting arrested. Where does Steven Seagal fall on that line? He is a legitimate I quito black belt. In fact, he was an instructor, one of the very first Americans to teach at a Dojo in Japan. So Steven Seagal. But the martial art is the questionable thing. It's the martial art of ICO is it's really a martial art that was created to disarm people with swords. The idea was that you lost your sword in combat and someone was coming at you with a sword. Last ditch effort is you had to be able to use someone's momentum against them. You gotta be able to use. Some guy comes at you with a sword. You have to be very adept at catching their arm and flipping them over. Here's the goal.

Speaker 3:          02:17:23       It's very subtle, right? Let's. Let's not use this because it's. It's easy to poke fun at him when he's old, but let's go to that black and white one. See that black and white one down there. Go to that. If you go back. See that one right there. Steven Seagal. Go to that one. Now. There's some some footage of him when he was young. Yeah. This is go fullscreen. He is legit. He is very legit and he was thin. It was a different thing, but the thing is nobody comes at you like this and a fucking ncaa wrestler would shoot a double on him and take him down faster than you can possibly imagine. I mean, this does not work. It's a dance. Well, it works. It works. If someone does know what they're doing or if you have a lot of physical attributes, like Seagal is a huge guy.

Speaker 3:          02:18:12       He's a very big guy and he probably could pull that off on a lot of people who don't know how to fight and I hear this is what it was about. What I. Quito is really bad. This is Kendo though. They're using swords, which maybe they do use some of that. Nikita. Quito, but would Akita was originally created for, I hope I'm not mistaken, was learning how to disarm like that. The guy comes out and with a knife and he flips the guy and takes the knife away. He's using the guy's energy against them. That was the original intention of I Quito, but in terms of Japanese martial arts, I was never thought of as the most effective judo is far more effective because judo involves people grabbing people and flipping them and slamming them on the ground. Like there's a great video of an old judo master.

Speaker 3:          02:19:00       See if you can find this video. There's this guy he looks like he's about 80 years old and he weighs about 13 pounds and he is lit. You can tell, especially someone who knows martial arts. You can tell when someone's just giving in the problem with a lot of these demonstrations by Ketos guys are just giving in like this old dude watch this old dude. The old dude in the right hand side is so much bigger than the other guy and they're walking the guy around and like, he's really throwing this guy right? This is legit. Like this is trying

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       not to get thrown and he doesn't know what to do. Like trips him to the ground there, but this old guy is tiny, but he's using perfect leverage and perfect technique and fuck. He looks really old in this picture, like the guys trying to throw him there and he can't pull it off and he can't pull it off because the older guy has perfect position and perfectly. What is the name of this video? Perfect

Speaker 2:          02:19:50       leverage. Look at this

Speaker 1:          02:19:52       nine years old. Judo master is the name of the video online and I don't know if he was really 90, but he certainly looks like it could be 90, but this old guy just knows how to notice. Also the back of his heels are always like lifting up. He's moving. This guy's trying to throw him and he's just. And the guy who's trying to throw him appears to be a black belt. At least he's wearing a black belt. Fucking incredible men. It's really amazing. So judo was a much more effective martial art and judo was actually what was taught to the Brazilians. Um, when count my ada went to Brazil and, uh, taught people in Brazil, Peru, particularly the gracies, they taught them Brazilian Jujitsu. The gracies took what was judo at the time and they took the ground attacks of judo and just perfected them and then hone them and changed them and made them more technical and really worked on utilizing leverage and utilizing submissions and they, they turned that into Brazilian Jujitsu.

Speaker 2:          02:20:56       So judo is standing as well as ground? Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:20:59       There's a ground aspect of judo obviously, like Ronda Rousey is probably one of the most famous submission artists in the UFC. And her background was in judo. She was a judo player and very good at judo. She was a bronze medalist, so when she would get ahold of people, she would just fucking throw 'em on their ass and flip them and toss them and slammed to the ground. She just had phenomenal judo but also a wicked arm bar. And that was because the Ne Waza the ground attack version. Part of Jujitsu comes from judo. So there you go.

Speaker 2:          02:21:29       Yeah. My father did judo and he taught it to me and my brother and then I remember my brother was bigger than me and he used to flip the fuck out and then he did it to me one day and my father grabbed him and flipped him down on the ground because like, this is not good. This is isn't like passing on knowledge. This is just a violent family. Added control was dead drunk. He was six foot two cigarette in his hand. My cigarette. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:21:54       Oh fuck. Yeah. Judo is legit. Judah is way more legit than a kito. Something like does not legit.

Speaker 2:          02:22:01       I was like, it's a lot of pressure points and holding the wrist in different ways. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:22:05       yeah. Most of it is throws and learning how to take an attack or like if you just charge forward and an Aikido guy and you have your, your right hand come on like cocked and ready and just run out of it. Throw that punch. A really good Akita. I was going to grab that and flip you and slammed me on the ground, but you know, how often does that come up? Most,

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       especially today when people actually know how to fight, it's just the, it's, it's too limited, but there's a lot of martial arts like that. Like there are certain aspects of karate that are applicable, but there's a lot of it that's really limited, you know, and it's just, if you're going to teach your daughters like, my daughter is 14 and I'd love for her to get into some martial arts, what would be the most effective Jujitsu selfdefence, Jujitsu, 100 percent, 100 percent. Because with Jujitsu, uh, first of all, you use a lot of your legs and a girl has strong legs. Your bodies, you're carrying your body run all the time with your legs. You can catch a guy in a triangle or an arm bar and break his arm or choke them asleep with your legs. I mean, there's a lot of girls that would fuck a lot of guys up on the ground just by using armbars and leg locks and things on.

Speaker 4:          02:23:11       Because an Armbar is your whole body against someone's arm or a triangle is your whole body, particularly your lower body, but you're using your upper body to pull down the head against the guy's neck and arms, so you're squashing the neck and the arms together and then you're pulling down to head. A girl could absolutely put a guy, a girl can put me to sleep. A girl's got a good triangle. It was like a legit black belt and I get caught in a triangle. I will have to tap out, man. Yeah, fact. You know legs are strong men. Yeah. Think about what you do with your legs. You know you can't. How long can you walk in your hands? I mean, who? Who? What's the world record for? Walking on your hands. So like an hour. How long if you walked to Disneyland? I mean, it's fucking your hours and hours on your feet.

Speaker 4:          02:23:57       All right. No problem at all. All right. What's the world record guy walked in his sand? A woman actually did it. Five thousand meters and eight hours. Whoa. Damn. She's a savage. Five thousand meters. What's that in American in 13,400 feet. How many hours? Eight. How did she eat? How do you eat upside down? Just didn't. Each took. Took eight hours off. Eat. Fuck. Can't do it. Can take it out. I did gymnastics for like six years and I could walk like a motherfucker on your hands. I can still walk on my hands and you really. I don't know what the risk now. Who knows? But like I could literally, I would walk around the house on my hands when I was a kid. It's a cool skill to have. It looks cool. Backflips to back to standing back flips that Jesus Christ record for defending 50 stairs. Jesus Christ on your hands.

Speaker 4:          02:24:52       Did it in 14 seconds. Fourteen seconds. Look at this fucking savage. He's got some pads on his hands, but he's guards. He's walking down those stairs like he's on his hand on his feet. Look at that. That's crazy. That's amazing. Wow. That's bounce. These Asian, they're not regular white people, right? Russians. They're stronger. Fuck Ya. If you think about that part of the world, man, that's a fascinating part of the world. Have tough. You have to be. Oh yeah, yeah. Siberia and Shit. Now those Russians, gang gangs came to New York. It was like a whole new world of organized crime. Like much more hardcore Italians. You think about like the old gangs, like the mafia guys now they seem like kind of soft and cuddly. Like a godfather. The Godfather, but these Russian guys, let's just still fucking cut your Achilles tendon out because you own 10 bucks.

Speaker 4:          02:25:51       Happened to me once. Somebody cut your Achilles tendon. No, no. I knew you were faking because you had the hint of a joke in your face. But part of me was like, really? What you want to told me that already, but I just remember seeing these. These Russian guys, they just, they look hard. They've just been out in the cold. Their whole lives. Women to heart. Beautiful, powerful genetics. Yeah. That lost a shit ton of men in the wars, right? You know? Yeah. How many Russian soldiers died in World War II? Millions. Millions. Millions. Millions. Starved to death. Apparently, yeah, yeah. It's just a hard part of the world, man. Not like la today. It was 50 degrees people like, oh my God, it's so cold. I got, I got a winter coat in the car running today and uh, I ran into my friend. She, uh, one of my neighbors, she had gloves on and a sock hat and like a, a fucking one of those.

Speaker 4:          02:26:51       Uh, what are those fucking Patagonia, like puffy jackets? I geared my daughter, you know, she serves. She was out six in the morning. She was in the ocean this morning. Damn, that's core that you raised some hardcore kids, dude. Yeah, she does it year round or an animal? Yeah. Tougher than me. Both deafer than me. That's amazing.
