Speaker 3:          00:04:02       bird crisis in the house, the fucking machine. Last return trying my day, Joe Rogan podcast by night. All Day.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       Yeah, in our long drawn out commercials that I do to sponsor this podcast to keep it free, ladies and gentlemen, because otherwise it would be unbearable if we couldn't make money from this fucker. Um, w Burke Chrysler was telling what I smell might be one of the great stories.

Speaker 3:          00:04:33       No, his dad. No, he used to shit his pants all the time. All the time. How long would you said the story began with you saying that he shit his pants in a banana republic in Beverly Hills and uh, it was, it was like real, it was like, like the real coming of age part of my life when my dad looked at me and he was like, buddy, I'm about to shit my pants. What do I do? We, here's the word, here's where public have a bathroom. Here's the fucking horse part of it, right? So I look at him and I go to shit, your pants dad, I think you shit your pants and I go, Shit your pants a little bit and then walk as far as you can and get to your hotel. And he just left. My daughter's with me like fucking drop them and was like, I'm talking out.

Speaker 3:          00:05:09       And so he started walking down Rodeo or whatever, you know, Burton, one of those roads to get to his hotel, right? So my mom comes up and she's like, she's like, where's your dad? And I said, oh, he left me this sweater, I got to buy it for, I bought them, ended up buying them the sweater and I go, he had he shit his pants. She goes, what do you mean he had he shit his pants. I go, we had to, she had to shit. So he shit his pants and then he just, he's walking down the street. I go, I'm sure we can catch him. He's walking slow and then my wife comes up, she goes, where's your dad? And I go, he shit his pants. He goes, why didn't you just use the bathroom? I said, where's the bathroom? She goes downstairs and I went, Ooh, I probably should have told them that and so you didn't think you were in the past? I don't know. I was in panic mode. It was black Friday and I'm waiting in line too when I got a leather jacket on sale.

Speaker 1:          00:05:47       Well, it's even worse. I think if you shit your pants in line for the bathroom because then everybody's going to know. If there's a big line of people that you just blow is dumping your pants, then you like close proximity. There's no way to

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       play off shitting your pants when you shit your pants. I say that shit in your pants is a lot like getting a Dui. You roll the dice so much and get away with it that when you do get caught with your hand and cookie jar, you're like, mother fucker just never thought that was going to happen. Are you kidding me? Why? I do this all the time. Why today? Oh, that's so true. When his thirties, he was running marathons and he used his shit, his pants all the time. Not even like, I'm not even saying like, I'm not even saying like, oh, uh, once a month, I'm talking once a week. He would, this is before cell phones too. He lives in his thirties. He was in his thirties. I was a, I was a kid. We were living in, in like North Tampa and not in like the nicer north Tampa, but in the Shittier redneck verse, Black North Tampa.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       And uh, first time I ever heard her, the n word was in this neighborhood, but my dad used to run marathons so we'd run like five miles, 10 miles and he'd go out and on these 10 mile runs, he shit his pants. So he go into these orange groves, shit himself, right. Clean himself the best he could and then run home. But there were some nights, I remember these distinctly, it was before cell phones where it get dark. And my was like, we got to go look for your dad. And we'd be driving his route where he'd run it. All of a sudden like a naked happy. My Dad would come out of the fucking orange groves like I'm here, give me in the car right now. If he knew who he come get him. Oh, he just would. Yeah, it would be. I remember thunder and lightening and he's just sitting in an orange grove naked, like how did it shit his pants and, and we'd be like over here and he'd be like, all right, you just hop in the front seat, go home, let's go real quick.

Speaker 3:          00:07:23       He shit his pants. He hates my stories. I hope someone, if anyone is listening to this, knows my dad. Let him listen to this because every fucking story I ever tell he fucking Oise goes, God damn, you're fucking imagination. Not how it fuck. I did not shit my pants. I Shit a little bit. I didn't Shit My, you're making people digging shit in my pants. He just squirts. He's just a little squirt her, I dunno. Let's call him on the phone. Do it. Let's get my dad on the phone. See this is a perfect example of my dad and I are night and day human beings. We were telling stories this weekend about like, like one time, one time, one morning I thought I was, my parents were out of town, my little sister was 10, I was probably 21 I was drinking a lot at the time.

Speaker 3:          00:08:07       So it was you know, party, Animal Shit. And then, and I was pissing a lot of places that like in the round houses, like a pistol. My ex girlfriend's dining room table and was walked in by her dad. Do you want to talk about a fucking nightmare? Only waiting. Waiting, waiting. Wait a minute. You pissed on the dining room? MEDOC her dad walked in and caught her dad. Larry MEDOC in Orlando. Larry, if you're listening, I, I, I'm guilty. I so here's, okay cause I never really accepted blame for it. I always said it never fucking happened cause it, cause I didn't want it to cause I didn't want, okay. Why did you do it? It was thanksgiving. It was right after the rolling stone magazine came out. And so, and I go back to party on what do you mean the rolling Stone magazine with a number of the rolling stone in 1997 called me the number one party animal in the country just for someone who's not, doesn't know.

Speaker 3:          00:08:56       And then that was a big deal. I became famous and I became famous in like Tampa, Florida, Tampa, Tallahassee, Gainesville, Orlando. Anywhere that I had people with four went to Florida state lived. I was, they knew who I was. They were like, cause the fucking party guy. So if I went out shots, really we'd any do people put drugs in my hand. Like it was fucking insane. I get roof feed. I got referred a couple of times. So you became like a sort of celebrity partier. I became the guy that I'd walk after the, before the article I was just the loud, fun, shirtless guy on top of the bar, getting everyone in a frenzy. And then when the article came out it was like the fucking lineman would come to the bar. I drank at Yonnie's and they'd pull me aside and they're like, you're drinking with us tonight.

Speaker 3:          00:09:37       We want to drink with a party animal and then I just be up with these lines and like four lineman and we'd be just doing shots and shots and shots and these guys are 350 pounds, two to 18 at the time, probably like going through to 18 and probably more like two 25 but, but and so I became like, like I say famous, I say like reality show famous like the way Snookie her first season was, you know, so that's how you were in your town and you're in Tallahassee. If I went and read right after that article came out in Tallahassee, definitely in Orlando, I knew 40% of the bar knew who I was in Tampa. Everyone knew who I was back when people actually read magazines that it's before reality shows. Before the Internet, before the Internet is a big one. It's like you were in this, so like you were, I was on Oprah called and wanted me to be on her show, but she wanted my parents to be on two and I was like, I'm not gonna do that.

Speaker 3:          00:10:25       And My fucking parents. So I did everything I did like fucking they sent you ready for this? This is how bizarre this eight period period got, they sent ESPN, sent a tour bus with two actors in it to come shoot a commercial of partying with me of what it's like to party with a number one party animal for the x games. Right. They wanted to like the, and one of the actors was Johnny Knoxville, fucking bizarre shit. So Johnny Knoxville, we meet and he says, you do drugs. And I was like, I was like, in my head, I'm like, yeah, I'm an adult. Let's do it. So going to this tour bus, I had never done pills like pills and so he like pores, I click send on Shit. No, no. Little stronger. Probably like Pete title pom probably still, he's just poured some tea, some Tylenol's, whatever it was.

Speaker 3:          00:11:09       He pours him in my hand. And so I like thumb one finger, one hold it down and he gives me too when I pop one and then he starts passing a bow. So you're being calculated about it. I was like, I don't know what the fuck I'm taking. I have no idea. And I haven't started drinking. I haven't done like, I'm just like, what the fuck? And there's not like someone might not got dive a fucking overdose around that guy. Yes, but he, this was before jackass, right? This is, this is like five, 10 years before jackass. And those were wild dunes. And Johnny Knoxville is passing bills around and he's lightened a bong and we're doing bong hits and he's, you gotta be careful of that and videos he's putting in videos of, of, of uh, of Bam. Margera trying to bring a bottle over his head and he's like, watch this.

Speaker 3:          00:11:47       And I were laughing our tits off. This is well before anyone knows what the fuck this is. And then I look at the other guy, I forget the other name, but I go, what was that? And he was like, dilaudid, you never had dilauded go. It's dilaudid. And he's like, it's like pharmaceutical heroin. It's awesome. You're gonna love it. And I was like, thank God I only took one. Jesus Christ. That's like what? Like they used to give chicks in the wild west movies. Yeah. When they had an issue. I have, she needs some dilaudid was a little dilauded. So we end up partying all night. We take this tour bus out, fill it up, dresses, women, throw herself down the stairs that says women fucking the corner. The craziest nights over that drinking and beer bottles over our heads. It was the craziest fucking night of my life.

Speaker 3:          00:12:24       Cut. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, um, there were no, they were, they were a fake breakaway beer bottles. But we were like, but we had seen Bam do it and we thought it was funny. So we were doing it with these fake breakaway bottles, but we're hit it with a real bottle. Bam. And I think it was Bam. In his posse, but it was a CKY posse. They were trying to break a beer bottle over their head. How did that happen? That that became my genre of entertainment. Like the Jackass Watch. Dude's do fucked up things and get hurt. Well, what happened? I have no idea. I don't know, but I've made a living doing it start. It started off with like Charlie Chaplin falling down the stairs, like the Buster Keaton pro, like physical comedy. Like I didn't see jackass three but I laughed my ass off at the fucking trailer.

Speaker 3:          00:13:07       I just, Oh, there's a bunch of movies and I just haven't gotten around to seeing, and that's one of them. But when that guy walks in the door and the giant hand fucking clobbered him with the face and he goes flying, I'm sorry. That's hilarious. It's a great, it's fucking hilarious. It's great. And it's funnier than, I'm 39 years old with two kids and it still makes me laugh. My Dad's, it's like an advanced version of like that Charlie Chaplin Shit, right? Oh yeah, that's exactly what it is. The thing is, it's guys, it's buddies. They're all in it together. Retard shit playing. When Johnny Knoxville put a fucking blindfold on and stood in front of the bull, he's out of his fucking mind. And this is after he's already a movie star, doesn't need to do it. And that was one upping them. So they had to do it and you're just like, this guy says fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:13:48       He was doing movies with the Rock and yet he would put a blindfold on a stand in front of a fucking real bull. A real bulls. Oh, that was terrifying. And the way he got launched easily could, a horn could, could've gone through him. Oh, I got mauled by a bowl and I'll tell you right now. Yeah, I got my bible and heard Burt. It was, yeah, this is before you're riding it. No, no, no. I was a Rodeo clown. They just go, they just taught me how to put the makeup on. They're like, all right, you're ready. I go, hold on. I'm gonna learn anything. And they're like, oh, stay away from the bowl. And I was like, that's it. And then they pull the pin. You hear that? Or the gate opens and a real fucking bull comes at like a real book.

Speaker 3:          00:14:23       Jesus comes and I just, we just met in my rib cage and he broke my ribs and broke my foot. Oh my God. Yeah. And then, and then the producer, Tim Scott says, you say Tim Scott with a little bit of them and you're going to fucking, I love the guy, but he did a cock sucker says to me, uh, that was really good. That's really good footage. We're going to do it. We need to do it like two more times. Hold on. You're out of your fucking mind. After you got your rib broke you five broken ribs and a broken foot. And I'm sitting on the ground wind knocked out of me just eh, and he's, well it's only

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       like eight seconds of footage. Like whoa. He goes, we need it to be a segment and in segments three and a half minutes and we can't make a footage out of eight, three, eight seconds. I mean if you watch it online it's they just reap, cause I didn't, wouldn't do it again and they just replay it over and over and over. Pretty uncreative of him that you couldn't come up with some sort of a way to fill that time where you would talk over it and describe what a terrible idea it was. Yeah, that's what we ended up doing. Believed that he was so irresponsible. They would ask you to do it again. It's Tim Scott for you. Why were you willing to do it the first place? I love Tim. He's still a friend of mine, but because I was, I don't know Tim, I don't know it was, but he sounds like a douche bag now.

Speaker 2:          00:15:29       He's, he's, he's in the Philippines right now. He's not listening to me this good so, but I'm sure he's a nice guy. But to ask you to do that after your ribbon, your foot is crazy. It was also, it was like a, I don't know, we told him, talked about this a couple of times. It was like a new discovery of of there. This is me getting mauled by the ball right here. So that's the book, right? That's not a baby bull at all. And that's me. Now if you're on the clock, you're probably looking at like right now it's four seconds and they're cutting this up to make it look longer. But this is exactly how quick it took. Just the bull comes and they go, all right, this is the [inaudible]. And then right now I'm trying to run, but my foot's broken so I can't stand on it.

Speaker 2:          00:16:07       Oh my God, Dude. Like you got hit by a truck. Yeah, I got hit by a fucking truck. Backed down just a little bit. Just the impact. Let it play for a second. It'll start. Yeah, replace it itself. I mean it'll, it'll replay it. Yeah, no, back up a little bit more, Brian. So we can see the impact. Oh, this is the first shot of the day. This is, we haven't shot anything right now. All we've done is we shot me put on makeup that weighs nothing way. It's gotta be 800 pounds. That's it. Fucking, I dunno. I Dunno. I guess. I don't think that's he's going to be sued. I think that's a lot bigger than that. Oh my God, that thing nailed you. It Hits me Square. I've never been hit that solid by anything. I was just, I said that the clip I got to hit them mouth with a baseball bat.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       I've been hit by cars. I've been hit like in a car accident. But man, when that bowl, it's whole head connected with my whole, and we met where my mic was right now. Um, this is after, this is me going, I'm not fucking doing it again. Look, I'm pretty face too much. I was skinny. I was, oh my God does show it like nailed. Oh my God, look at that impact. I know. Holy Shit. And you're lucky. The thing that stumped on your head. Wait, watch, watch. You can see where it breaks my foot. It doesn't look like those, those look, watch it right. Here you go. That's the hope print. God, just get this boy away from me so that I don't speak with a slur for the rest of my life. And have it in my head. I do more cushioning in your face. It's filtered from your beer checked. You are right where you should have been charged for first time. How many times these guys would hit. These are professional. This guy fucking,

Speaker 3:          00:17:53       he was, he was cut like all stitches. Broken bones. What a crazy way to make a living. Right. I don't know how he's, Oh we, okay. So wait, I'm going to bring it back to where we started. So, so that is my connection with Jack Ass and that I didn't show very similar to it for six episodes. We did six episodes, but I met Johnny Knoxville after the rolling stone stuff. The rolling stone stuff was crazy when that came out it was like being famous cut back to how I pissed on my girlfriend's table. So thank you. So that was like unwinding. I was like, that was like untangling a necklace. Is that so and so we go out in Orlando, this is right after Thanksgiving when everyone's home. So everyone I know from Orlando is at every bar. All in like Church Street I think is the name of the street.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       So we go out and it's fucking chaos on with my girlfriend, her sister and her sister's boyfriend who was the coolest fucking guy and he'll always have weed. So we go out and everyone's buying me shots. We're getting fucking hammered. Her parents had just bought a house, just bought this brand new house just like I ended. It was their dream house. We had Thanksgiving together. We held hands, talked about how at the table, how this is everything we've worked for guys as a team. We saved, we scrimped we buy. Anyway, we go back to her house and I'm like, I'm not fucking done. Like I want to keep drinking. And this Guy Dan, he's like, oh yeah, me too. So we got like a 12 pack of beer and we'd go out to the dock and d and that's all I remember Danny. Then the next morning we counts everything to me because I might, she walks in the first thing in the morning, could you piss on my dining room table? And I'm like, no. Why would I fucking do that? I'm a grown man. I don't piss on tables. You'd like my dad said he caught you pissing on her table. Make your dad is crazy. He doesn't like me cause I'm in the party animal and he's trying to get me out of your life. That's what's fucking going on.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       And you got the fucking room for going to blame it on me. Shit, I'm the party animal. I'm sure. I'm sure you know what the fuck you're talking to right now. He wants me out of your life. Number one party animal. The country, but something to the, yeah, I'm sure I actually use the words so you probably had to Kesha explaining it. Aw. Did you ever think about getting it? I'm the party animal tattooed anywhere in your body. I was thinking about getting a squirrel with a beer can in a cigarette that said the parties squirrel on at one time.

Speaker 2:          00:20:03       Who's going to fuck a question that too so we can tell me what your tattoo about it. If I was a cop and I pulled you over and you had a party squirreled Tatooine I'd immediately take you to jail. I'm like, I know this guy did something fucked up in the last couple of months. You've just got to get it out of them. We just going to sit down and go, you know what you did? Just tell me you know what you did. Just tell me. We'll all get out of here early. We'll get you a nice quick sentence. Just tell me what happened so I don't even know what you're talking about. Okay, so, so she, I party, Squirrel foot.

Speaker 3:          00:20:33       She goes out to the breakfast table where family is. Oh my God. How much pissed are we talking about here? In my head it didn't happen. And your head, it didn't happen. You didn't have any black out fucking, I swear to you, all my children right now, I laid in that bed, rolled over and I went, how? Fuck, wait a minute. How do you, how do you know your home? He didn't fucking sell you down the river. Maybe he pissed on a table and then say that you did it. That's why he woke you up in the morning. He knew you blacked out and then they blame you for pissing on the table. That's what's going through my head right now is I rolled back over and I go fuck them. Maybe, maybe, maybe that would be called shitting, but yet maybe we call it a Brian train wreck.

Speaker 3:          00:21:08       You smoking a regular cigarette over there? No, it's got wheat in it. All right, so, so Danny, the boyfriend comes in and he's like, comes in and his eyes are like so excited. He goes, I heard you piss on their table. And I'm like, no, why is everyone fucking saying that? And he's like, cause her dad walked in on your pissing on the table and I said, he's fucking lying. He goes, man, he is pretty set in the, he saw you pissing on their dining room table. And I go, Danny, I don't remember fucking anything. He goes, he goes, well we got these beers. We went out to their doc, do remember that? And I go, yes. And he was like, and I had a joint. And I go, okay, I remember that. And he's like, and then you ate the joint. And I was like, I don't remember that.

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       And he goes, yeah, I said, hold this and you ate it and laughed. And then we killed all the beers out there and I go, fuck, we did. And he was like, yeah. And then you start piecing back like little things. I go, did we get stuck in a phone booth last night? And he's like, no, we got locked in their food cabinet, like in their, in their food closet, like a pantry in their pantry because we were eating in their kitchen. And then this and this. I start, remember I go, yeah, so like a girlfriend, the girlfriend's coming in, it was a sliding door. So it was, we were eating and the girlfriends came out, the sisters and they go, you're fucking making a ton of noise. So me and Danny went into the pantry and shut the door. But then we couldn't figure out how to open it because there wasn't a handle.

Speaker 3:          00:22:24       You guys were hammered and you had a pantry may shoved you in the Pantry to quiet you down. We shoved ourselves into the pantry so that we can continue eating. We're like, we're going to bed. They left, we went to the Pantry, shut the door, and then I remember sitting in the pantry. I do remember this distinctly is us being in the pantry thinking we in a phone booth laughing how hard all, they had all this food in this phone booth and we're like, he believed this bull Moose heads fucking Doritos in it. So then that's all I remember. So then he says to me, he goes, them man, he's really adamant. So he leaves. I lay back down and I'm like, I can't believe I'm in frame for this shit. All of a sudden I start. You ever have one of those where you remember the dream you had last night?

Speaker 3:          00:23:04       And I distinctly remember seeing her dad in his underwear. In my dream, I'm like, I'm like, wait. I did have a dream about her dad and his underwear. That's odd. And then I was like, but he was in here yelling at me. There's not a jury and you had sex with an old man. No, he, what happened was, and this, and then I start going, oh shit, this totally did happen. I woke up in the middle of the night, walked out to their dining room table, erect and tried to go to the bathroom. You know how you would kind of try to lean it down. So I must've been making a ton of noise at their dining room table. Pissed on their dining room table, full blown, pissed on their dining room, whatever. This now, now I'm remembering. I'm like, Oh shit, I fucking do remember you. I remember being erect.

Speaker 3:          00:23:43       I remember, yeah, I remember. I remember, I just remember trying to pee. You know how when you, you have one of those nights where you're like in the bathroom and you're like, I can't get to like lean forward. So I'm leaning forward over their dining room table, trying to Piss, making a ton of noise, knocking everything off of it. He comes out and is tidy. Whities I remember that because she came back in and I go to is your dad were tidy? Whities and she goes, he does. Why I don't want it. Nevermind. I mean you can't dream. I like, no one wears off. So anyhow, I dream about tighty whities twenties let's say 26 25 so here's the worst part. He yells at me and he goes, where the fuck? What the fuck are you doing? And I said, I'm going to bed. And he said, where's your bed? And I, and I pointed to the dining room table. I go right here. And he goes, what? I, David Blaine the tablecloth, pull it, lay on the bed on the, on top of their table at the table. He pissed him in my own business and my this in a superman, cape full of Piss. Just let Kurt and myself go back to sleep and he gets me up and walks me into my bed and puts me back in my bed. And I'm like,

Speaker 4:          00:24:45       what a nice guy. We it with, our relationship was fucking doomed. Like there was no, I get up that he's a nice guy. He's a really nice Larry Maddock is a saint because if that happened to one of my daughters and my house, I would have beat the fucking kid's ass. So I get up. What'd you really man? No, do it like that again though. I would beat the fucking kids as passionate voice. Have you ever considered acting? Maybe, maybe Ip. All the time when I'm really wasted. Like if I black out like drunk night, I'll wake up and think like, Oh I have to pee right now. And I always like put on a shirt the next morning like, oh, why is it smelled like urine? All that did it again. I've done, I do it all the time when I drink a lot. So when you a lot, you'll piss the bed.

Speaker 4:          00:25:26       I think I get confused and I wake up and I'm like, I just pee on my suitcases lie. Like if I put in hampers hammered of really drunk people. Peanut suitcases. Yeah. That's actually fairly common. Yeah, it happens maybe twice a year, but it's still happens enough where I'm just like ever do something like that. Ready? Never did something like that. That sounds like something right up Eddie Bravo. He probably peed on the, Eddie used to have these blackouts that were so bad. I had to write a story about it. I wrote a blog entry called drug Eddie. I think I read that it was that about when you guys were in Rome and he missed his flight. Germany, Germany. Well, he didn't miss his flight. He took my, my car to the airport. He was so hammered and he woke up in the backseat of the car, didn't know anything.

Speaker 4:          00:26:06       I go downstairs, I'm like, where's there's a car? It's supposed to be to take me to the airport for Rogan and they go rogue and already left and I go, what? He goes, yeah, long hair, tattoos like mother fucker. So I called Joe Rogan airports like an hour and a half away. He's only five minutes away from it by the time I call him, like the car is already there and I'm like, what happened man? What are you doing? He said, I don't know. I woke up in the back of this car. To be fair. He was wearing Joe's clothes. He was wearing an outfit that looked the resembled me. No, it was um, just a, a party time and I just got got hammered and some man, they just,

Speaker 1:          00:26:44       they, they just can actually forget what happened.

Speaker 4:          00:26:46       Oh yeah, I've definitely blacked out. I don't drink like that anymore. I haven't, I have not had an episode like that in a really long time. Like in years ago,

Speaker 1:          00:26:54       you and I stopped doing it or just the last few days, like four days I stopped drinking caffeine. I needed to cut it all out. I'm dude, I've never done that ever. Like consciously cut it out. But I'm like, I love coffee. I like the smell of it. I like the ritual of it. I, I, I make French press coffee, so I grind the beans and I, you know, nice water. You know, I use clean filtered water and I, you know, I get this Kona coffee beans for Hawaii. It's delicious. It tastes good, but you know, it's, you, you get these spikes and then the crash is that the really fucked up thing. And the last couple of days I've had no caffeine like the last five, six days and there's no crash. It's weird. It's like,

Speaker 4:          00:27:34       just scream. Anything else? Do you find yourself eating tons of chocolate? No, but I want to drink the coffee and it's not that I need it, it's that. It's a ritual. It's a, it's etched in my mind. Like, you know, Oh, I'm at Barnes and noble by an emagazine. Let me just get a cup of coffee and say, I gotta take a shit. I gotta take a shit at Barnes and noble has some of the worst shits ever. You walk into that bathroom, if you have to pig, God bless you. God bless you in your nostrils. Smell some coffee shits. But to me with just eaten those fucking cookies and drinking coffee, I can't, I can't. Here's my problem with coffee. Here's why I want to cut it. Cut it out. Because I had my first cup and I feel really good. Then I go, let's have another card. Let's have another cop. So I have my other cop and then I'm like, man, I'm fucking tweaking. I need to write. You need to get some shit, laundry. And then, and then I had my third cup and now my eyes are twitching and I'm like, I don't feel so good. I want to take, I want to take a Xanax and go to bed. Then I'm like, why can't I just find a happy middle ground? Yeah, it's good if you want to get something done. Like it's good. I I um,

Speaker 1:          00:28:34       I debated back and forth whether or not to have one right before the podcast cause like it's always good to be charged up. I do the podcast and I was like, no, let's see what happens. Cause I've, I've been doing this for the past. Like I said, I guess it's probably been about five or six days now and very little alcohol. The only alcohol I've been limiting myself to like one drink, one glass of wine, maybe two at the most. But that's it. I read this thing recently about drinking, about like going out and getting fucked up and how bad it is on your muscles and he's off. You do this, you're your body's ability to recover. And then it takes you three weeks to get back to 100%, three weeks. All sorts of shit that it does. Like when you get severely dehydrated from really getting hammered, really, really hung over.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       There's also an effect on cerebral spinal fluid that takes two weeks to recover from. So there's like all these different things, the different processes that a, that happened when your body gets severely dehydrated and so really fucked up from alcohol. And there's just like this rebuilding process. It's like, you know, it takes a long time and if you're fucking hitting it hard all the time, you really never given yourself a chance to recover. That's why pre prematurely aged, you know. And I um, started feeling recently that like, like I've never taken time away from, from coffee. I've never taken time away from alcohol and I've always done whatever I wanted to do and fall and I have a couple of years, we'll have a couple of years. I wanted to drink wine, I drink wine. I never thought about it. I never really tried to limit myself. So this is a psychological pulled is a problem. It's like you, you start thinking about it and psychologically you could see how people can get addicted to things because psychologically when you resist something, I could, I went on a diet once for a little while. I tried to Atkins Diet just for a goof, just to see what his life fucking diet. Yeah. It's good. Except you. If you cut something out of your life like pasta. Yeah, Dude. That is the shit you're going to crave and such a a rabbit.

Speaker 4:          00:30:22       Hey man, I never want cookies, but I want as I'm Atkins, I want to cook all. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:30:25       It's easy to eat clean if you decide to eat clean, but if you've got some crazy law, like if you have some rules and now you know you're following those, you're not just eating clean. You know you're following those specific rules. All of the things that aren't on there. The thing is you start crazy.

Speaker 4:          00:30:38       Yeah. It's the second I quit drinking. I go, that's when all the beer commercials look awesome. Yeah. Like, man, I can't, I can't ever quit. I can't ever quit for good. That's why I need to reel it in every now and then and go, all right, I need to be in control of everything so it won't be a fucking alcoholic. I don't want to be something lush. Who who you see on stage and all he does is slur his words and lays down on the stage

Speaker 1:          00:30:58       and alcohol, commercial, a beer commercial. That's all you really need is just that little push. It's like your, what it is is you're already thinking about getting drunk. That alcohol commercial, like people say that targets children and it looks like what a great party. Yeah, sorta. But you know who it really targets. It really targets guys who aren't partying. That's thinking about have that beer. Maybe they broke up the black. Now I'm only 50 and I got another shot in me. Man. I've seen some fucking old guys and young girls

Speaker 4:          00:31:28       today start thinking things like that. But it's such a natural feeling. Normal. It's a normal part of being a monkey. So my dad is going through, going through like Dad's ready to get some young person, I dunno, but being around the podcast, we'll see what sucked he was he, if there's a girl out there and there's a million people on this podcast, there's a girl in there that this was never know his pants. Some girls like that smell of urine and true. He had a blood infection and almost died. Whoa. Like a couple couple, like a week ago, two weeks ago we sent, now you got that charity posts coming your way. I see what you're working is that, that somebody puts their gum, old shit is really in his fucking head about almost over and then you start. Then it got into my head and I was like, wow man, I'm 39 like this is coming. You're healthy dude. You enjoy the moment. That's the most important thing, but take care of your vehicle. You know the real problem with fucking alcohol is alcohol kills your vehicle. You know the marijuana, alcohol, and when you're costing for your world, the body is a vehicle. Brian Red Band, the body, the human body.

Speaker 1:          00:32:36       The problem is alcohol is fun as fuck. You know, this is the very few things like that are as fun as just a good night out. When you're drunk with a bunch of fun friends and you're all laughing and cracking up and the end of the night you go eat somewhere stupid. Eat some greasy meat concoction with cheese and gravy and you and you take your fat stupid ass to bed. And all those nights are fun, man. Those, those are some, some brilliant nights. But God damn those Sunday morning suck a bag, don't they? They suck dude. That, that feeling of hung over as you're headed to the airport and you can't drink enough water and you're like I said, Vegas ones. I think the biggest ones are the worst. Yeah, because also you get outside of those casinos and there's no longer oxygen pumping everywhere. Is that a myth?

Speaker 2:          00:33:19       They actually do that and there's no clocks in any casinos. It's true. But you don't, you ever watch a stupid fuck? No. Cause they didn't because my watch is my iPhone and they scramble all the iPhone. So none of the phones work, so you have no phone shit. Do you believe that you believe they scramble the phone? Fuck yeah, I do. I don't believe that they scramble it 100% but I believe that as soon as I walk in there, I'll go from three to four bars to no service back and forth.

Speaker 1:          00:33:41       Yeah. That just goes back and forth almost like they're, they're making your phone's cut off so that you could just say to your wife, what honey, honey, I'm, I'm by the tables. I'll call you in and out.

Speaker 2:          00:33:50       No, it's, it's a good thing for that. And they set these places up like you get lost in them. Oh yeah. All the carpet's fucking confusing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:58       Yeah. And there's a amaze. You realize who you going through all those machines. They're not set up in some sort of an orderly way that's easy to see for your space. Now there's a God damn maze. It's like the mains of the shining. That's exactly what it's like. I want to get you in there and hopefully suck everything out of you. Suck the money out to you either through your balls, there's hookers and those mazes or suck the money out to the machine.

Speaker 2:          00:34:19       We had a hooker one time at Vegas, not had a hooker, but we had a hooker proposition. Me and my buddy Eddie and, and my, and she was the one of the hottest chicks I've ever seen in my life. And my buddy Eddie was like, how much? And she was like $1,300. I can't cause I'm a cause I'm trying to drive home tonight. This is good for driving. Yeah, it's just a cigarette. Yeah. Until I go. Wow. My feet feel like they're glued into the space. We'd is good for driving. This is, this makes you think you're not even driving anymore and driving here on the, which Macola, I was like, felt like I was in a video game. It's called the highway son. Who's the stone one? Yeah. Where's that? You know, driving in on that. Which McAllen in that thing don't do. It's a new fangled hard surface. The earth is using. It's the thing I put the alcohol and all those new mind vehicle. The new monkeys

Speaker 1:          00:35:07       transporting themselves in a much more rapid way and it's a hard surface, what is it called? Whatever. Whatever. Anyway, point being Marijuana Fox, my driving up,

Speaker 2:          00:35:18       I could never, I could never drive high. Really? How can you drive or did you do? Why don't drive that high? I'll be here for a few hours. I, I'm, I'm pretty sober by the time I actually leave, but I do Jujitsu hard. I did a lot of things. I do comedy, high sugar stop your buzz, but it also, you don't have to realize I have a high tolerance, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you're smoking a leg. And then my last year of college I was smoking a lot of weed and I could, I could smoke all night long and be fine, but I now if I, if I took like a hit, I definitely feel it. Especially I think we'd was different back then too. We'd good for you for Christ. Let me tell you something. Don't listen to me.

Speaker 1:          00:35:51       I don't follow my advice because it's faulty. I have, you know, it's a lot of trial and error and a, I mean quite a few errors. I'm not saying I'm right about everything, but I'm right about this.

Speaker 2:          00:36:02       We'd my friend, I'm not right about everything, my friend

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       good for you. And what you are afraid of with weed is what we all need. We all need a little humility. We all need to be terrified by the Matrix. We all need a view of the great beyond. And what we gives you is a terrifying feeling of of your mortality. It gives you a feeling of insecurity, a feeling of what you can call paranoia. But cause what it is is you've dropped, dropped all the blinders all around you and you realize how ridiculous his proposition is. Period. There is no way around the fact that it's ridiculous. We are in fact just one part of a universe. It's above our head. We, there's no, there's no actual ending to any of it and just goes and we're a part of it and we're floating in it and we're only here for a little bit and we don't know what we're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:36:48       And everybody knows as much as you do and you don't know anything. I mean, there's some people who know more facts. They know more about the laws of physics, they know more about, but the purpose of it all or where it ends or what's for what? Is there a meaning to this? Is this just a device to move entropy forward? Is this a device for innovation? What? What are, what are the humans? What does this life? No one knows. Not a fucking one. No one. That's why you need marijuana. Shit, man. I want to let you know man. I got to later. That's what she know, Dude. That's what we need. Marijuana commercials. It's not bad for you. It's just bad for pharmaceutical companies. Yeah. Cause fuck heads with, I mean it's supposed to be on America land of the free home of the brave.

Speaker 1:          00:37:30       You're locking people up for a plant that makes you silly. There's nothing fucking free. You're brave about that. That's pitch moves, right? That's, that's, that's a bitch move. That's the only person who would lock you up for weed. You know what I mean? If you had, if you had to create your own society, if it was Bert world and you had, you know, there's a hundred people and you claim that you were the king of Burt world and you've got to establish all the loss. Could you imagine if you said no pot, I'll be like, fuck you Bert. That'll allow pot. Yeah, a hundred people and make everyone shaved their heads. I think we all need to live like they live in Afghanistan, man. Just warlords, warlords residing over small pieces of land. Do you think you'd be a warlord? I Dunno. I'd worked for one. Maybe that's better. You don't want to be the guy in front. You don't want to be the figure head. You know you don't want to be Bush. You'd rather be Dick Cheney.

Speaker 2:          00:38:15       Yeah. What I would do is I would, I would teach the warlord Jujitsu or something. Warlord. Blacksmith, you know, I always wanting to learn how to work shirt. Make one of those Samurai swords where they fold the blade over, over and over again. I would to take a trade.

Speaker 1:          00:38:30       That's what I would do. Really what I'm saying is that I think we really would be better off if you want to have any government at all. It should be very local, but just a small group and then the only time the federal comes in is when the group started arguing and then the federal comes and goes, Dude's relax. We're all here to temporarily keep it together. Hundreds of people, not, not millions. If in a war. Lord Brian, what do you, where do you think you'd fit in in a world war two he would dominate per crash. Are we talking about you?

Speaker 2:          00:38:54       Yeah, the life of the party part. I'd be the guy by the fire lighting the fire first, putting it out at the end of the night, like going, I don't know why I'm all of a sudden in a fucking village with a fire. I'm sure we spell it out.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       Some story. Yeah. That's why Conan the barbarian. Barbara was always cool. I wouldn't make them. When I was 13 years old is when I became addicted to Conan the barbarian books, the Robert E. Howard books. Really ever read them? No, I didn't know there were books. Oh, brilliant. Brilliant books. We've talked about him a few times so it couldn't, wasn't a man a much words like what would they, did they just write with a lot of like narrative? Oh that's not necessarily true in the the books he would, he talked really, but the adventures were sell fucking deep. It was all about this guy named Robert. He Howard and what's that guy's name that's on? Um, he was in, um, he was in full metal jacket. He played pile and full metal jacket. Wait, Vincent Vincent D'onofrio. Thank you very much. Vincent D'onofrio played this Guy Robert. He Howard in a movie about his life cause Robert Howard was his like really eccentric, eccentric character who wrote all these fantastic novels, a fantasy, but like lived with his mother and his thirties and shot himself, killed himself. But he was responsible for Conan the barbarian and crawl the conqueror and all these different fantasy books. This dude wrote. They were fucking awesome dude. When you're 13 it's a 13 year old boy's version of twilight is. It's like they're just these fantastic fucking stories of, you know, of sorcerers and fucking sword fights and demons and it's just awesome shit

Speaker 2:          00:40:24       man. That's, and you read that. I never read chapter two. Those were the books I read. That was then. This is now they're watching. That was my shit. Swan Lake or the route? The little mouse. That road there might motorcycle. No, Ralph. You never got into comic books or anything? No, I never had a common goal with my life. Really. What about you Brian? You got into college? I actually just read the walking dead and I read the hallway. I started watching it. I just watched the first episode getting goals, the comic almost exact like look at the timelines. A little, little switched around, but it's so amazing how well they did it. So good. That's the only show I'm watching these days and the only fiction show I'm watching walking dead. I tried to get into everything up. Well, I still like breaking bad next time I go to get them when I'm getting my tattoo. Finished. I'm going to go back and watch the rest of breaking bad. You're going to get different braking, right?

Speaker 5:          00:41:13       Oh, my shoulder blades. Let everybody know I'm down a fucking party. I saw something new, Dude. Some new white rap dude on TV last night.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       Last night. I was up late at night watching the PAC man fight. I had it on a DVR. I hadn't watched it yet. No

Speaker 5:          00:41:32       one. No.

Speaker 2:          00:41:34       Well see that's the reason he keeps putting these bombs out there because every now and then he just went out of the park.

Speaker 6:          00:41:43       One memo, Marcus. Anyway, they had this awesome fighting and I still hadn't watched it, so I was up watching it and uh, what was it? What the hell were we talking about? What was the point on Pac man? No, it was before PAC man. What was the breaking bad tattoo? You're getting your tattoos. He only shows you watch. God dammit. I completely forgot what I was talking about. Can someone tweet us real quick and tell us what we're talking about? We smoked too much pot folks. It helps and it hurts. It's there and yet it's not. What? Ethereal. I apologize. It's probably my fault. How's it your fault? Cause you brought a pack. Definitely threw, threw us off the fuck he did. But it was worth, it was worth doing.

But he was with that Birdman guy. Manny, do you know who the Birdman Guy is? The guy from fresh, I mean fresh from the hot boys. Yes. And uh, apparently that is like the number one guy in the car game. You know what that means? Like he always has the freshest cars, got his cars or read articles about him and dub magazine. You should do all the money from juvie. He gets like $1 million worth of cars every year plus every year. Just new cars constantly hooks him up. Make some like super stereos, bad ass rims.

Speaker 6:          00:43:59       Um, and I'm, I'm watching this. I'm like, wow, this is some crazy music. I'm like, I wonder what my grandfather would think if my grandfather who came here from Italy, you know, in the 1930s I think he came, maybe it was the 1920s came to America from Italy. I wonder, you know, he was like innocent Natera and shade go over his house. They would be playing opera music. I wonder what, how alien that would be for him to like, if he could be my age, if he could be in his 40 sitting in front of the TV watching absolutely hysterically. I bet he'd think it was a joke. I bet he'd go, I bet he'd look at it and go,

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       oh, I like really go get a gut laugh and go, I can't believe this is all areas. I don't think you would've taken it that well. Birdman Tattoo.

Speaker 7:          00:45:30       God.

Speaker 4:          00:45:33       But not her. Not Him, but there was one, there was birdman is above you. It's above you right there. See that click that bird birdman is the lighter skin black ball. Oh, you've got fucked. This is probably not what you're looking for, but here's the virus bitch. I have, oh wait, you have a Mac. The virus just don't work. Amazing. How many PC people want to still stick with pcs after that? Just due to trust me man. The moment, the numbers of Mac users moment, they get up to a certain amount where it's worthy of their time. Then they'll start writing viruses we need to do worthy of their time. Don't understand, but they don't have it now. Dummy. What kit? What do you care? You don't can get them now where there's no viruses. That's better. Whoa. That's now. There's another side of his head. The other side. It's got a bunch of shit too. I would say. Got, got someone that's cheek right there. That one right there. Boom. Fucking shit. I'd love to be as nurse if he was in a coma and just read him. Read them. Yeah. Like just look at his body while he's out. Like, Oh yeah. So you don't have to worry about him and just read everything about his body and have one of his friends to explain, oh, CMH is the neighborhood in New Orleans who grew up in this cash money hose.

Speaker 4:          00:46:45       It's a weird way of living, man. I mean, they, they're making, uh, like they're making a living, a sensational one out of just live in big. I mean that's what they're offering. They're talking about how big they live and showing you how they don't give a fuck getting tattoos and their head driving around Bentleys. What bitch? Literally. Yeah, exactly. Stop me. Stop me from women. I dare you fucking face. That's before the stars on the head. Yeah. That's the one man. He's got something. He's got something crying. He's killed three rain belts cheat that you're not catching in that picture. I have something written on his cheek. It's hard to see in that picture, but in the video you kind of see it, you know essentially got writing all over his face. He's really does have writing over his face. He's

Speaker 2:          00:47:29       a wild dude. I'm just wanting to get a tattoo lately. What do you want to get? How about that squirrel with a beer. Huh? I would have, I would have to get done sleeved. What was your first one? You didn't have any on news radio, right? No, I had one that I got the graphics logo. I remember there's like a demon with a jester's hat on. I was a retard. I was like 23 or something like that. When I got that, I was such a dummy and I still have it. Yeah, you still have it. I, for some reason I thought you kind of covered up.

Speaker 6:          00:48:05       Oh, shut up. I drew it actually. That's right. I had a guy,

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       it's actually a pretty cool tattoo for 1980 89.

Speaker 8:          00:48:23       I drew that in. Uh,

Speaker 2:          00:48:27       fuck.

Speaker 6:          00:48:30       I drew that in whatever it was when I had it done. I guess it was probably like 1990 or something.

Speaker 2:          00:48:35       I guess it's not a good idea to mix electricity. Uh, with the, the new stadium. Everything's under control. We've got it handled. What are you doing your next hour? I don't know man. Hopefully soon.

Speaker 6:          00:48:50       Louis C K style. I like the way he's doing it, man. He's just releasing it on the Internet. That's really the smart way to do it. We want to figure out if there's a way to do that. Five bucks, two bucks, five bucks. You get stream it live or it doesn't matter. He doesn't have to be live. You know, you should be able to just get it whenever you want it and then just make it a podcast. But a paid born on iTunes, like a rental, you know, that's sort of a good idea. But I would have to like, I would have to set it up correctly. Can I tell you, I mean maybe cameras and you know, make sure it's directed well. You know, that's kind of a part of a standup is like when you watch a standup special, what's really cool is a special, but what's really underrated is like all the people that do it behind the scenes.

Speaker 6:          00:49:29       Like the guy who directs the UFC is a very good friend of mine, Anthony Giordano, and he's the one who did my, uh, my special too. But I'm like, he's a guy who understands like how to make something look cool, how to cut things, how to shoot things. Like, you know, bring some life to it. Not just here to record this but record this and put it into focus in an artistic way that makes it more exciting. Yeah. So I have to have fraud and I were talking about doing dates together in February. Oh really? That's awesome. When I was going to do it, I don't know. I think uh, Dorfman's brother, uh, I love half Ron. He's great. He's a great guy to have on the road with you too. Great Guy. He's and he's put together. What's that?

Speaker 8:          00:50:05       Well, nothing microphone me.

Speaker 2:          00:50:09       Yeah. Am I talking into it wrong? So yeah, we were talking about doing dates in February. You turn it that way on purpose. Did I? Yeah. You were getting really upset during when we were talking earlier. Blacked out Bro. He all over the table. It's all over. Remember? No, I don't imagine

Speaker 9:          00:50:28       you had a boat. Get a huge bonus. Do you guys were tidy? Whities no, I don't. I've been going back to the tighter ones lately because I did boxers for like 10 or 15 years, but it was just too dangerous. You know, boxers entangled with your dig and you're like waking up and you're like, why is my Dick like asleep? And then you realize your boxers all wrapped up

Speaker 6:          00:50:47       tidy whities style. But I wear black underwear because I don't want to see my farts splatter paint, all want to be reminded of it. Look, this is just a part of being a human being. We've got to be. That's that whole, that shit comes out of that. Occasionally air doesn't leak out of there and occasionally it stains your underwear. Are we playing games here? Why are you giving me white underwear? Is this a fucking test that I can't win? Is this a test I cannot. Yes. Yeah. There's this yellow by my Dick. This cause my Dick drips pissed. What am I supposed to do? Get toilet paper out and dammit. No, I'm a man. I stick it back in my pants and then we clean the fucking underwear and then a couple months I buy new pairs. That's right. Amen. Amen. Black ones and I don't need a fucking hole. Somebody please provide a solid pair of underwear thing. Dick Nicole is.

Speaker 9:          00:51:36       It's just more embarrassing than anything. Like you're fucking like getting a ups guy looks of your penis and the only way you should use that vehicles. If you have

Speaker 6:          00:51:43       ugly balls, if you have some like pomegranate looking balls, you have some deal breaker balls. You're like, listen baby, I got a pretty deck but I got some balls. It'll scare the fucking paint off your car. You don't want to, you don't want to scare off the listen baby. You can see my balls eventually, but right now it's just a beautiful day. It's a glowing sort of passion, lust. But then you see the balls and they just like troll eyeball. The halls are horrible and they drip the leaking. My balls are so bad. How bad are there bad? What's wrong with them? They're, the ball stops at like say like four inches five but the scrotum keeps going. That's because you have a lot of potential for manliness and it is, is it's like say if you went to a surgeon and they were going to give you artificial breasts, they would make a nice deep pocket for a good set of double D's.

Speaker 6:          00:52:31       You gotta create some space and that's what it is. You just got a lot of room. Nice. I, it makes me feel a lot better about my balls to do that by giant balls. You can be totally running shit. That'd be great. If a man, a doctor told you that he could give you a them examine. He's like, man, you're gonna be a great man. This is what he has to say about a lot of potential. It should be the greatest American ever measure. Potential ball size when it counts in America has, how big are your balls? That's really what we admire and if you really want to get real well we admire is how big are your balls? What are you willing to do? Yeah. How crazy he wanted to get. That's why I shall look. Jackass works. That's why you know standup comedy works. That's why fighting works. That's why anything crazy, crazy. Are you willing to, again, I like, I was watching this show where they were talking about his guy who died recently, who is a professional snowboarder. Apparently he caused an avalanche and I think I heard about this guy. Yeah. You know, or I believe it was. I mean it's happened more than one time. You know where these like extreme athletes, they go back home.

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       Try dropped off in a helicopter. Yeah man. I like Whoa. Like what the fuck? Yeah, that's, that's as real as it gets. Oh d two for a sport. Have you seen you, I think our only reason I, I take this, I say I say to you, have you seen, but the only reason I probably saw it as, cause it'd be your news feed on Twitter. Have you seen the guy in the squirrel outfit jump off the fucking thing and Ms. Brown miss the ground by like six fucking Oh my God. It's incredible. And he's going a hundred miles an hour. Oh, that is one of the most amazing videos I've ever seen. Insane. What are those called? Is Wingstop at squirl up as well? I think they're called squirrel shoots. That's what it looks like. It was like a flying school. Yeah. It's incredible. It's one of the baddest things I've ever seen in my life is you'd have to be absolutely fucking fearless to do that because one mistake, one miscalculation of the terrain.

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       Yeah. Well you don't pull up in time. And you slam into the fucking mountain. You're getting a hundred miles an hour. You are following that is that is a game changer. A crazy idea. Who is the mother fucker that tested that out? Oh, that it was when I jumped out of a plane with Rachael Ray. I did the, I was fucking hardcore panicked, but I was like, man, when you're screaming at the earth at a hundred miles an hour, there is a fucking surreal moment where you go, all right, this is it. Oh my God. If this shoe doesn't open, it doesn't open and I die with some dudes strapped on me like a rape harness. Some horrible fucking in Rachel Ray Goes Home Pi. That's a guy. Rachel is like a gangster and Rachel does I ship? Yeah, he's got my back permanently stapled to your back. He's literally harnessed into where you can't get, you couldn't, you can't get rid of the guy.

Speaker 3:          00:55:02       And it's the most uncomfortable position to have a man in sitting on a man's Dick in the, on the flight up to get to 13,000 feet. So you can jump out and you're having, you're trying to have your own little moment, but you've got some East German with his arms around you. Hold onto you like go and let's, let's start you up. Tighten up what a, what a crazy fucking activity you. But that is 26 people died and there was like 2006 was a little last year. We looked at it, an alarming amount of people die. Skydiving. An alarming like when you wait, not that morning. I woke up, I was in the, I was at the W in, in Union Square, beautiful hotel. And I think what could go wrong, I'm going to just check the odds and see how many people die skydiving. And there were like up to this year. Mind you.

Speaker 3:          00:55:40       I was like, Jay, it's like fucking August and they're like 46 and I was like 40 fucking six. That's a lot of people like that. I'm not comfortable with those odds. And that is in a year in a year here and then you two and then you see a video, they show you a video and they go the, it's a, it's an old dude and he goes, you have to know you're entering into an activity that you, that will is likely to cause death. You May die today and you're like, wait, why would I want to do this? It's not that cool. Yeah, it's not that fun. Like I don't want to fucking die. But then you do it and you land and you live and there is a week where you feel like you have a secret that no one knows like a fucking week where you are the most powerful human being in your head.

Speaker 3:          00:56:23       You see movies where a guy's running across the top of the thing in in your head, you go, I could do that. I jumped out of a fucking plane. Like you really, you feel limitless, you feel like you've, you've climbed the tallest mountain, new jumped out of a fucking plane and you live, you, you beat the odds, you fucking one. And then you get addicted to that. And like, like I know Rachel and I have been doing some crazy shit, like just doing some bizarre shit lately. And in February we're going swimming with sharks and I was like in the cage and she goes, fuck it out of the cage. So we're doing, going swimming with sharks out of the cage and then we're going to do what's going on with you and Rachel Ray's been doing, I mean, we could do a lot of Jaeger bombs and then like, you're like, hey, let's do these ever black out really nice wine.

Speaker 3:          00:57:01       I have blacked out. Rachel. Ray's being on you. No, no, no, no, I'm definitely, we party black car. You blacked out with her before we partied in Mexico. Meet her and her husband and we killed it. I killed. I will say I cause I don't want to fucking thing anyone to think that she drinks a lot, but I murdered some wine, nice wine and her in her room and her husband listen to comb your hair. Did he come here to suck? Cock hold story. Very cool. Very cool. Do you want to keep the party going?

Speaker 10:         00:57:31       You have to tell no tales. I understand. Listen,

Speaker 3:          00:57:34       I wouldn't, I would do this exact same thing. I Love Rachel and I love John. Who Doesn't love Rachel Maddow, whatever names current. Her husband makes me some Lasagna and we're in a hotel room. I'm not going to like fuck the guy. She looks like she's got a great personality. She's a lot of fun. She's a human being. She just seems like like a fun person to be around. She's a blast. She doesn't seem negative at all. Not at one part. Yeah, I haven't. I don't think I hear it. She's a rare person too. That's like a celebrity that you don't hear people criticizing that much. I don't really hear people talk shit about Rachael Ray. No one really liked her. She's great. She has a loft down in Soho. You go over, she has parties really and videotaped the whole shit. She for her show and then she'll like cut the cameras and they show up.

Speaker 3:          00:58:11       Let's talk shit. I saw Ricky Gervais' here the night like me, just, just like really gospel has comedy, comedy and she loves comedy. She fucking loves comedy and I guarantee you, I guarantee you she's on a treadmill or an elliptical right now listening to those shit. If you had another life. I love these. I love these. If you know, if young Burt had gone left instead of right one day, you know it just spike some weird stroke of luck. A 30 year old Bert meets a, who knows how old she was and you're both Sangal. Yeah. Let me think, man. It's happening. You think like if we're not famous, if you guys had met, no, no, not on payments, but I'm like saying like just a parallel universes. I meet her at a Bar, right? All Dream Girl. She dreams. She's mothers. Will your wife, I know my wife's listening. You, your mother, your mother. Do you want me this? Rachel's and kind of chick that you who he's got a son. I've got a son. You don't know about him yet.

Speaker 10:         00:59:08       Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:59:09       She's the kind of chick that I will say that any dude that met her in a bar with lug it in a heartbeat. She's so cool. Does your wife that you talk about her like this damn, cause there's nothing. You can't say anything bad about it or like, and usually I'm pretty honest about everyone and, and I, and I'll find something that I go, yeah, but you wouldn't like this about it. But with Rachel it's like everything you love, you love everything about her. She's cool. She fucking gets it. Like, or you can tell a joke, they're like, we got two bodyguards, you go to Mexico, we each got bodyguards and then as those Gary, oh so great. And so, and I told her, I said, what does that, who were the bodyguards? Mine was Edgar and hers was, I think his words were worried that the body guards of like sold information cause they've seen birth to conquer and they want you to do a bunch of shit around their house.

Speaker 3:          00:59:53       I haven't dealt with cartels. I didn't speak any English. No, none. But I see it as a joke. I go, oh, let's take our body guards down to the beach and make them fight. And she laughed. She was like, oh, it'll be fucking hilarious. Like, like as a joke. Right, right. But you tell it to some people in the industry and they'd be like, come on man, let's not be disrespectful. They're working very hard. They tell you the politically right answer. She just laughed and she's like, that'd be funny. Like just a real cool, wait a minute. You're talking about two trained killers to train killers. It's natural to see which one would kill the other one. I wanted to track them down at the beach. She's her correct and her interest. And so you, it doesn't mean they should do it. And then we get to pistol whip the loser.

Speaker 3:          01:00:30       Whoa. That's where you want to cross the line, Mr. Not with me. Really. Aw. Aw. Come on man. We're in Mexico. Shit's going down. What do you do you think it's weird that there's a third world country that's connected to us? I mean, how crazy is that? The way where we got fucking everything over in Afghanistan right now. You know, think about all the soldiers we have over there. Meanwhile, right next door is a third world country with a drug war going on. It's like having ripped arms and a perfect uh, chest, but then just a gut like no in a rotten ass hole and a small Dick, a broken small deck, small digs. It doesn't even work. Like we cut it off. Like it goes, it goes, it goes money, money, money, money, money, money. Like you do not get the mother's money in Mexico, but you know, the, the big

Speaker 4:          01:01:15       Mexico City and stuff like that. I mean, there's really nice sections in Mexico City. We were, we were saying that Miguel de Allende and it was a very fucking nice, they showed the Hbo Special, uh, the 24, seven with Pacquiao and Marquez and they showed like Mexico City, like Mexico City is like a real city, you know, it's a, it's a, a high entity. It's fucking huge. I think Mexico City is the biggest city. In fact in the world. It's really high up. The altitude is high shit. I'm guessing it might have just made that up. I know that the air quality there is fucking terrible. It's really hard to break it to smog issue. It's real bad. This is more people in Mexico City I think than any other city in the world. I might be out of line though. I think it's close though. Whatever it is.

Speaker 4:          01:01:52       It's, it's top. It's right up there. But it's bigger than any of the American cities. It's a massive fucking city. Yeah, it's got one and I mean you figure our, the quality of life there has got to be, it's got a soccer well in some areas. Yeah. It's, I mean we, they showed one main wall. Mark has his place, like he had fucking a Mercedes and a Porsche. How do you have that right next? All that shit. You got to live dangerously with sun, you know, because you're, you're flaunting in front of a large population, half nots.

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       Oh Lord.

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       Population of have nots. Who Don't, who? I'm a man. I'm assuming there have nots

Speaker 1:          01:02:25       10 times worse than our have. The difference between, um, uh, Marquez who's rich in America. You know, one Limo Marquez is a world champion boxer, a famous athlete in his country, loved by millions of people. One of the, you know, tough his boxers on the fucking planet in this country, in America, he's rich as fuck in America. He's made millions of dollars in Mexico. That must be staggering. Like the difference between him and you know, you know, in America him and a minimum wage worker is substantial, but it's almost, you could see it in the distance possible. Insurmountable in Mexico. Mexico is insurmountable. It's insane. It's impossible. How could someone stay in Mexico and you know, and you know, what are the percentages of earning the amount of money that this guys are like, this is insane. And so for him to be flaunting light it in Mexico is like, wow, that's a, it seemed to me, I don't know anything about the college

Speaker 3:          01:03:17       really talking about my last bet, I bet seemed extravagant, but I bet, well we're not putting into this is that he is a Mexican hero. He's a hero. No one's fucking with him because he is the golden boy to them because he represents them every fucking day. The, the guy who came from nothing. You got somewhere. And I bet that is what keeps him safe. I bet no one touches him cause they go, they go, what are we going to fucking take away? Or, or, or Adam Rodriguez, whatever the fuck guys name is baseball and Menlo Marcus, I don't know, element like our Derek Jeter.

Speaker 1:          01:03:47       Yeah, yeah, yeah. He is, you know, he's a, he's a bad ass mother fucker. You know, he and he like fights for the pride of Mexico to along with it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:03:55       And he's a Mexican boxer man. Mexican boxers are fucking gangster. Punched me. Beat me somebody. Why you will not stop.

Speaker 1:          01:04:02       Yeah. There has been some of the best fighters ever as Julio Cesar Chavez in his prime is probably one of my all time favorite boxers to watch cause he would just beat dude's down with like volume punching. He wouldn't punch like even like full blast. 100% wouldn't you like eight engage in wild slug fest. He would just fucking and methodically move and throw Beaton's on dudes and hit him with body shots and break guys just slowly, slowly break guys. You know. And even guys there were two more talented than him. Like did you see the Meldrick Taylor fight?

Speaker 3:          01:04:31       Wait, metal teller tellers. The guy who can barely speak.

Speaker 1:          01:04:34       Yeah Dude. Yeah. Don't do what a fight. That was what our board where it was. Yeah, I did see that. Taylor was boxing. Julio, Cesar Chavez, his face off for most of the 12 round fight. And then towards the end, Chavez connects and starts connecting on them in the final round and nails and with a right hand and drop some. He gets up with like three seconds to go or something crazy like that on the clock. Richard Steele waves it off and he calls the fight. So Chavez came from this beating but as young, incredibly fast, like technically sound Olympic boxer or he was just getting lit up and it looked like, wow, you know, he's just too good. It's too good, you know, he's too fast. But Chavez just slowly kept methodically breaking them down, slowly breaking down to the body and then eventually overcame them. And the very last seconds of the fight overcame him and it would, would've for sure stopped him if Richard Steele would make him, made him stand up again, it didn't matter. He would have stopped him. He would have jumped on him again. Eight seconds is not enough. He would have last and he was done or whatever it was. It was, it was two or one seconds. It was the right call. Meldrick Taylor was fucked up. He was pissing blood and he was never the same again

Speaker 2:          01:05:42       and he's, and if you watch videos of him, he starts with a dip pronounced that stagger and stuttered.

Speaker 1:          01:05:48       Well that is one of the most like w like obvious examples of a fighter who has a really tough fight, like an all time epic battle and then essentially never reaches that. That performance level again, you don't know whether or not it's physical, like it took a lot out of their body, which you know, that does play a factor of a real big beating like that. Like that, I mean a real war that can really, those body shots at Chavez hit him with over and over again. That can really wreck havoc on you. And then you also got to consider his motivation when a guy gets beat up, sometimes they don't have the zest and the fire that they had when they were undefeated and they thought they were unstoppable. That's me. Yeah, piss strong dudes, man. They just talking, you know, young and full of confidence.

Speaker 1:          01:06:29       They got the world and they feel like there's, I run into so many guys, especially in the UFC, these young guys with this incredible confidence and incredible confidence, and then you see them have a really tough fight. You'll see them have a really tough fight and then you'll see a marine gauge and sort of look at this a little bit different and go, okay, you know what? Everybody's vulnerable. Okay, let's not get crazy here. Let's not do something stupid. You're going to do this. Let's do this intelligently. And the ones that think that way, they have a long life in the sport and the ones that don't, those are the ones that, you know, they, they have a few epic contests where they essentially have a really, really difficult time recovering from, whether it's psychologically, whether it's physically, you know, those really, really tough ones. Those are the hard ones to come back from it.

Speaker 2:          01:07:12       Getting your oil, you have one.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       Well I think it is, but it's important for people to, it's a humility thing. You need to know that that's possible to you. You can't always be the hammer. And for a lot of young, fast people, especially a lot of young athletic people, they're always the hammer and it used to be in the hammer. You're terrified of being in the nail, you know, once, once you've taken some shots before and you understand like this is a give and receive bitch, this isn't just to give and sometimes you're going to get fucked up. Just like the way you like to fuck up other people. Sometimes you're going, as long as we can accept that and understand that, then you can look at this whole thing rationally and instead of thinking, you know, with this crazy confidence that you're on top of. So guys, games change and I could change for the better or could change for the worst, all dependent on how committed they are to their goal.

Speaker 2:          01:07:51       I follow. It was a bad ass at 15 like bad ass. Why'd you think that? But I dunno then been beaten up. I was terrified at 15 really? Very, very, very, really? Yeah man. And you, I really got into taekwondo. Yeah, I would didn't, I just thought I was tough. I was big, like I was a bigger kid. Like I was the in the top of the level of the height and size and I just thought I was tough. And then, and then you get your dick knocked in the dirt a couple of and you're like, okay,

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       I got humiliated in what wasn't really a fight. It wasn't a fight, but it was a bigger kid who just did something to me. No, he wrestled me to the ground. He thought he like, like hip toss me to the ground. We were just playing around, you know, like, um, I don't, I don't remember what started it off. I wasn't really that friendly with them, but I was like, Hey, what's up? You know, it was one of those things and somehow or another we were in a of the locker room, like leaving and we got, we, we said something and we were joking around and he pushed me and I pushed it back. We grabbed each other and the hip toss man on the ground and just laid on top of me for a couple seconds and I couldn't get up. I got into how to get up and they let me up and you know, he laughed about it and it wasn't really a fight, but it was he and humiliated was enough was you weren't cool with it.

Speaker 6:          01:08:58       I wasn't. I wasn't cool with the fact that he could do that. I was like, Shit, fuck. It threw me on the ground and I couldn't do it. So then I started wrestling. I just, I, that's when I took wrestling. Seriously. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, that was ridiculous because it was, I had an inflated sense of what I could do physically because I thought that physically I'm a really strong guy. I know how to strike. Like, you know, if anyone's going to want to get in a fight, I'll fucking kicking in the balls. You have all these stupid ideas in your head of what you're going to do with why you're a Badass. Then some guy just hip tosses you had lays on top of you and you're like, I can't give this guy off me. Like I really, I couldn't get him off of me. I just couldn't. I had to give up and he let me up. It was a huge eye opener, you know? And then luckily he was a nice guy. He didn't beat me up or anything when she had me down. But you know, it was a good eye opening message. That's

Speaker 3:          01:09:42       so funny because I, I'd practiced none of the real striking. I would practice the talking before the fight. You were good at that. I would do it in my mirror. Yes. I'd be like, you want to fuck a piece of this? I'll fuck you up. I'll fuck you up three ways from Sunday. And I'm, we just practice it and I would like, like shirt off and like flags every, every kid did that and every one of our kids are our guys in like there was a gang called the caveman. No, no, no, I wasn't. I wasn't, well, I was, I was in the gang Corolla, the caveman, there's a gang called the caveman in Tampa and the cave men were like these public school kids book from the Rich Public School. And they were like, they were, they would just get in fights all the time with Jesuit kids.

Speaker 3:          01:10:25       I went to Jesuit and I was in a get, and they're not a gang, but a club called Apu and Ebu and cave men fall all the time. So when from like my junior year, until my senior year, even my sophomore year, you always had to be aware of the cavemen. And so like you'd go to a party in a fight would break out and would be the caveman. And so then that's when I, I was like, I was like, that's it. I got to learn how to fight. But I never really learned how to fight. I just learn how to talk shit. So, and then as you're opening move just to be loud and crazy, man, let them know that you're in for some dangerous shit. I remember the first time ever punched someone. It was, uh, the first time I ever punched someone was a black dude.

Speaker 3:          01:11:03       Uh, it was the rob that another girl gang, I think from Robinson. I think it was called chain again. No, no, no. I wasn't in a gang. I was just going to a club. I was in, Hey, a afterschool club at my school and everyone else had gangs. But then our afterschool club was the one that got involved with gangs because of the, but it wasn't even gangs. It wasn't any gangs. It just fucking high school kids. It wasn't like real gangs. So nobody got killed. No one got killed. Just heat up this fight. Definitely guys got beat up. And then there was one like gang from I think Robinson. I think they were called TWT together we foliated with anybody. No, no, no. Yeah. Well yeah, it was a part of this like Ebu Group, like the EPA pluribus unum. It's on the penny that's ours.

Speaker 3:          01:11:42       Had like some Latin significance to it. Everyone else TWD together. We thought so. Cave men. So you were in gang, not gang is a very strong word for what we were. We were a group of guys who are at school together who likes guys played football and baseball and wrestled and we were like the cooler guys at our school and we were in this group called Gpu that was a sanction group by this school. You had initiations where you got paddled and you initiated into it and, but it just happens that the one guy, the head of EPO in like 1988 got into a fight with a caveman. And so all the fucking Apu or is for cavemen, Ebu, fought whoever when Robinson or Hillsborough. And so at a young age you realized you had to stay away from those fucking people. So the first punch I ever thought, so it was, I heard a fight is a story.

Speaker 3:          01:12:30       I've told him stand up many a time, but the, the short, the short, honest version of it is, and was at a party, someone you'll fight. And I thought all of Ebu, all my friends were going to come and watch it. And I roll out. And it's, it's one caveman, right? And the whole TWT together. We thought posse, like it's all black dudes and one white caveman. And I stick my head in and I actually know this cave man. I know, I know who, I know his reputation, but he's unconscious on the fucking floor because there was Mario, he was fighting this guy, Donovan and I stuck my head in and second I stuck my head in. They were like, oh, here's his brother, get him to, and they pushed me in and I was like, well, I'm not as brother. I know he was friend.

Speaker 3:          01:13:05       Like we're not, I'm not on anyone's team. I'm on a different team like, but they think we're on the same team because we're wearing the away uniforms, you know, so this guy be the beat the shit out of me standing. Does that make sense? Like I didn't fall, he didn't kick me, but I never at any point did, it looked like I won and I did a lot of trying to talk my way out of it. But while he was hitting you, you were trying to talk to him. I was like, man, I'm not, and you just pounded me. And he was like, he was like, oh. And he was talking shit. Like as he was fighting me, like I just weird shit. Like you follow me, you me round them all mother fucker. And I was like, what? And he's like, follow me around them all bitch.

Speaker 3:          01:13:39       See what happens. See what happens. This is what's up, this is what's up and just pop in me. And I was like, I got the chicken. So the first punch I ever threw was then, uh, and I go to throw a punch, but I never thought a punch before. I'd only worked on talking shit. So my shit talking without door. So I'm getting my ass kicked. So I go to the hole punch by just, it was more like a hey, like it was like a, like a, yeah, like a, like a stop. Like, Oh, you break my heart. They get, oh, and I literally, my hand landed in this high top fade.

Speaker 4:          01:14:12       It went into his hair. Okay. And, and I remember thinking to myself in this, this is, the joke is very different than this, but the truth is when into his hair. And I held it there. So I thought I'd never talked to a black person's hair before and I, Collagen moved my fingers around a little bit. He didn't move. And then all of a sudden the cop showed up. Oh my God. When the cop showed up and then all the fucking brothers fucking took off except for this guy, the cop showed up because they knew there was a fight going on. Cops showed up. Tuesday, odd cars, conscious two squad cars, two rednecks. And the other guy is still out cold. I'll fucking cold. Would they do to him? Uh, he was just laying on the ground. He's the lanes you got there he is.

Speaker 4:          01:14:46       He'd already been knocked down. He was that guy when I stuck my head in, he was unconscious. And this Guy Donovan, who is standing over him, beating him, pummeling him though. And I fucking stuck my head in, thank God I did. The kid might be dead, but I stuck my head in and I was like, oh, I don't want any of that. What? He ordered it. I'll take something else. That kind of damage when a guy's out and a guy gets beat up while he's out kicked his head. Like sometimes people never recover. Yeah. That dude that got really fucked up and a in La Dodgers. Dodgers. Same. Yeah, cause he was wearing, I guess he was wearing another Jersey from another. I should have scares them. Who knows. I mean maybe he did other things. I don't know why they beat his ass, but they definitely shouldn't have done what they did.

Speaker 4:          01:15:23       What they did was horrific man. It was a nightmare. I have no idea how that guy behaved, but you know they need, obviously they need more security. There's no way they should be allowing that many people that do a place like that to a position where that kind of shit can happen. Oh the dodger stadium. Sketchy. Tighten that down man. You know when a guy gets beat down like that, like shit man, you, you need to be able to protect people from thugs. There should be out fucking guy. Code numbers are too high. What this first of all those people or who? Anybody who would do that as a sick fuck and you know what we're having here man, it's, it's a classic example of people not caring about terrible neighborhoods. Those terrible neighborhoods have more kids come out of him and more kids come out of them.

Speaker 4:          01:16:03       They want to do fucked up things and that just the way it goes, it's not part of the country. You know what, that's a very accurate statement. Cause I, the other day I realized I don't judge a man based on his skin color in the slightest. I judge them based on their age. Age is the most fucking determining factor when we were in Amsterdam. Dude, a lot of smart young dudes, man. I mean there's a lot more today I think than I've ever met in the past. I meet dudes that are like 20 years old that are on the fucking ball and that does happen, but it's a lot. You know who's throwing punches at bars and bars? 20 year olds. It's always going to be that man. He's always gonna be a certain percentage of them, but I think not a lot of 39 year olds stolen fucking sucker punches.

Speaker 4:          01:16:40       He's there are planning some losers. It never got it together. Yeah man. You underestimate. There's a lot of good of Vegas. Go ahead and hang out in those fucking crap dens and watch the degenerate gamblers head of the horse track. You know there's, there's plenty of 30 and nine year old man. She can't share anything. Yeah, yeah. They're just tired or less white and I'm happy you don't have the gumption ended quicker. Yeah. They just got the gumption to get up and give me a fucking ass kicking. It really depends on what they ate for lunch. Yeah. They might've had a burrito and they just got

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       no energy and they're just ready to shit their pants. The Guy Talk Shit to you. When was the last time a guy talk shit to you?

Speaker 1:          01:17:15       Oh, I don't know. I mean, it happens, you know, it hasn't happened in a lot of time. Most people were really nice to me. I'm very lucky, you know, when people say like, what's the downside to, you know, people knowing who you are when you go to the,

Speaker 9:          01:17:26       like a stranger or somebody paid to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:17:29       A stranger, what the fuck are you eating Dick? Who paid to do that? Thank God you're broadcasting meeting DMT. So yeah. You haven't had, you haven't had a confrontation?

Speaker 1:          01:17:46       No. People are generally cool. Did you ever think I'm nice? You know, I think, you know, if you come to me with some sort of a, a predetermined idea of who I am or you know what you think about something I said once and you know, you're angry at me, dad, it's probably not gonna be a fun conversation to have that had that happen before where people misinterpret something I said or taken out a contact or disagree with it, you know, and that, that can happen. But for the most part, most of the people that meet me or Nice, Nice. And even when someone does like, listen man, it's just an opinion. You know, they'll have to get people get so God damn attached to their opinions, you know, if you know, if you just just stop and go, who the fuck knows and stop and go, well maybe you're right.

Speaker 1:          01:18:26       That clears up a lot of shit. You know, it's really simple and you know, and, and they had a little Google add that to the mix and you know, you should be dealing with much less problems. We should have because of Google for real. And we should probably have, I'd say a 75% reduction in arguments between human beings. They should be resolved 75% quicker just from the access to information. Because how many goddamn arguments when we were kids came out of one guy talking about his fucking ass and you know in it, but you not having an encyclopedia handy.

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       Oh yeah. And you just would fight that. You don't fight that until the day he knows you. That's a cock sucker that thinks that movie went straight to video. It didn't go straight to video. They don't even make movies straight to video that it was fucking, it was all in the movie theater theaters for at least two weeks. I know because my dad told me those are frustrating conversations man, and you never had closure can, it's more as knows that Kenny's worries was even say fucking the movies go to straight to fucking video. And I was like, that doesn't happen. It was a fucking nightmare fight when we were kids when I still remember it. Yeah, we had fights. We had, I would, you'd argue with someone and you just get into it with them and you just would never have closure and you'd fucking be like, fine, we agree to disagree and I'll just hit your guts secretly behind your back.

Speaker 1:          01:19:32       Bert Kreischer talking about how he and handles relationships. Everybody has their own approach to, what's yours? Call us now at one 800.

Speaker 9:          01:19:41       What is it? Chicago right now. And I have a question for brick right here. Shoot. Um, my wife has three nipples, but both of them are on her ass home.

Speaker 2:          01:19:53       She has three

Speaker 1:          01:19:55       circling her asshole. Like crop circles.

Speaker 9:          01:19:57       Yeah, they're in there inside. But if he can feel them with your finger, right. And if you come down here, we'll what we'll show you. It's um, I need to know what to do that

Speaker 2:          01:20:06       he needed to bail on this. Wait, no, no. Wait. [inaudible] failed. Impromptu actual breast area where the nipple would have been where the Areola is. There's an aerial would no nipple. You ever dated a girl who essentially an aerial and no nipple of your dating girls like that? I've had, I've dated girls that's aerial is have been chopped off and then they've had boobs put in when it's so dry. And then it's like, that's like a ghost nipple in some ways. You know, that's not like a, you know what I mean? It goes, what is that? Is that a real song? I just made that up. Listen. Yeah, that was, that was a song that I, we were barbecued one night and we were hanging out with him and he was, he had just started dating this particular last and for some reason we started singing a song called, I saw your girlfriend's buttle photographs of her.

Speaker 2:          01:21:00       And here's a picture of her right now. Is that, that's a nice picture. It's from Howard Stern pitcher, but Brian, how'd that happen? How'd you ever hook up with a chick like that? You Sir? Do you have sex magic? Do you have sex? Totally Naked Brian? Yeah. Well when he's like the pool, I certainly like the pool. I usually wear a jersey like a polo. Like have you ever had, if you ever had sex with clothes on, I guess you have like quickie sex with a shirt on. Kevin James I would think would have sex with his shirt on because I didn't know. But he seems like a guy that he's always got a hat on and he's always got something covering, you know, Kevin is an interesting guy. Kevin's a really interesting guy. I went to his house one time a long time ago and got fucking Ballato in front of him and I just watched him look at me like studying me.

Speaker 2:          01:21:48       Like how does this happen? Like how it would be like blotto drunk toy. Yeah, it was me and Gary [inaudible]. Gary knows how to put them away and Gary started drinking in Vegas. I've been an ended at, at Kevin's house many evening drinking with Gary back in the day. God Damn he is a, he'll put them back and he's a good dude. I saw him all the time, guys. I saw Gary Valentine one time at the Improv. Take a shot of a candle. He took a ship time, shut up and put it back into the stuff that was on a funny shot. All right, let's keep going guys. Keep going. No, he drank it for you. Just fucking shot it back. Get a candle shop. Let's keep going guys. Man. Gary Valentine's a fucking party. Got, did I ever tell you what happened? Oh, this is my favorite.

Speaker 2:          01:22:25       Sweet. I maybe I did. Wait. So did I ever tell you, what did you do you remember Mike? You know Mike Burton, Mike Burton, comedian, bald, Jewish, good, good body. And he's a man. I don't know what I'm saying. That caring, not like it just works out. He's working hard. Comma, guy he preaches is really system of martial arts. He teaches Krav Maga right now. So anyway, so one time me, Gary, and this Guy Scott Henry and, and Mike Burton are all drinking it for most of cafe. This is like Thursday. We don't have to work. Gary and I are making money. We're doing an show. And I go, I go guys, let's go to Vegas. And everyone's fucking, and except for Burton,

Speaker 3:          01:23:06       he's like, I don't want to go. Burton was a comic and he was, he's stopped doing comedy since he was funny, but he wasn't like that funny. So he goes, I don't want to go. And Gary's like, come on, come on, burden, let's go. And he's like, I don't want to go. I don't want to go. So we got to go. Fuck it. I'm going to my house, I'm packing my bags. I'll meet you guys at Scott and Burton's house in like in like 30 minutes. So we go meet me, Burton and Scott go to Scott and Burton's house and burn goes off. Fuck it. I'll go, I'll go burn. And there's what you do hide in the back of my truck. We're taking my Escalade, a navigator or whatever and the way back hiding the way back. And we won't tell Gary you're going until halfway there.

Speaker 3:          01:23:37       Well when when we get halfway to Vegas, you pop him and go, surprise, I'm coming. So he goes, that's a great idea. That's a great idea. So we fucking pack the car and we're waiting. Gary Valentine pulls up and his parks his car and he comes up and he's like, what's up? I said, hop in and we're ready. And he was all right, Scott. Henry's driving my truck, Gary Hobson, the backseat, and he goes, where's Burton? And we'd go, well he couldn't come. And Gary Goes, let me tell you something about, about motherfucker. Let me tell you why he's not a good comic for one. And all of a sudden I'm looking in the rear view mirror. I see Burton's heads sit up in the way back and he goes, because he's not fucking funny and I don't have the heart to tell him he shouldn't like, and he starts fucking tearing. Burton apart ended and we are in Hollywood until we get on the fucking 10 all of a sudden Burton go, I go, Gary, can you reach in the back of Basmeh and beer? He reaches back and he sees Burton. He goes, hey, burden. Hey turns, it looks to me, cause you're going to tell him he's in the fucking car. Oh, most uncomfortable. The whole rest of the ride to Vegas, they just spoke like in the backseat, just talked, hashed it out and no one spoke to each other the rest of the weekend. Fucking uncomfortable.

Speaker 6:          01:24:38       There's sometimes dues will blow up and they don't even mean exactly what they're saying. They're just frustrated with their own lives and they find something about someone else, whether it's a minor glitch in their system or whatever, and they just start poking at it. And it's sort of a distraction to turn that same, you know, objectivity and insight to yourself. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:24:59       I, I, yeah, I've, I've done it. I've done it like when I was less, but when I was younger in this business, like I would definitely take apart someone I did not know and look at their act and be like that fuck. And I would, you could get me started on someone and I would destroy that motherfucker and pick apart everything. And then all they had to say was, hey man, I'm a big fan of your stuff. I'd be like, I'm a big fan of you too. Love you. I've been a big fear for a long time,

Speaker 6:          01:25:25       but there are dudes that are annoying. I mean, there's no getting past that. There are guys who get up there and they're annoying, but you just can't avoid them. You know? I just avoid their acts, you know? That's, that's the best way. Just to just, you know, kind of get out of their way when they're up and just, but you can be that, you can do it when you're young a lot of the times you got to follow that person. Well the follow was not the real issue. It's when someone tells you what you can't, do you ever have that when you opened for those?

Speaker 3:          01:25:47       Oh fuck that. Yeah, that is, that is a

Speaker 6:          01:25:52       some real negative dudes out there. Oh, that will start to like, like micromanage your act when you work at like be clubs. That happens a lot. Oh yeah. The headline. I will tell you, you could, whatever you do, you can't talk about, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       you can have like your whole opening bit about farming. Like yeah. How about I have a different bit about farming and you do, is that okay? Yeah. You know like what the fuck dude, you can't tell me what I can't talk about. It's one thing. It's like a guy purposely tried to step on your material in that I'm sure you've had happened where they you open or you have like one day, well you'll be the headliner and he'll be the middle act and he'll have a certain set and it'll do well and then you'll have a bunch of bits on certain subjects and all of a sudden the next night he magically has these new bits that you can tell her new bits. The cut off short, they that expanded on and there are about the same exact subjects that you taught

Speaker 3:          01:26:38       and they're just, sometimes it's not even just stepping on what you're about to talk about. He's trying to make your act less effective on purpose. Fucking exhausting and it's happened to me so much. It happens to a lot of comics when they're like third in there in like 32 they're not making a ton of money in the making 1200 bucks on the road and they've got some feature. I could make it 700 bucks. I was like, fuck this guy. I've never heard of him. I'm going to take, I'm going to make sure that they flip flop this at the end of the week and they sell like five DVDs with two tee shirts and they'll undercut your sales. I'm selling the DVD for 20 bucks and this guys, I'm selling all my shit, but 25 Bam. It's really unfortunate. You know,

Speaker 1:          01:27:13       the only way you should go to do shows when someone is, if you're friends with someone, like I don't like dealing like eve. I love doing the k rock shows because I know all those people that do those. Like they have that big April fool's April foolishness show on April fool's Day, April fool's day, weekend, whatever it is. And it's always that, uh, that huge place and a universal, what does that theater and universe, it's like 6,000 fucking people and it's all a lot of people that I don't normally hang out with, but everybody is really funny. You kind of know him off from the business, but it's way more fun when you're working and you work on the road with friends. It's way more fun. Like it's, there's not like for whatever reason, some comics want them to be the only one that is getting the laughs. Yeah. It can't just have a good set and then you have a good set too.

Speaker 3:          01:27:58       It's a company, it's a competition. It's one on one. Like I'm the funniest motherfucker in this club tonight. I need to be the one that when they exit they go, you were funnier than that guy. They need that

Speaker 1:          01:28:07       and then it becomes what we were talking about earlier, before we even started rolling about being addicted to killing,

Speaker 3:          01:28:12       being addicted to killing is the worst thing that can ever happen to a comic. Because I heard you and brewer talk about this maybe seven years ago, six years ago, and it was when it was, when Dane was

Speaker 1:          01:28:24       blown up and you guys were saying that Dane is the perfect guy that's addicted to killing, that he, you know, it's like what we exactly what we were talking about with your friend. They don't want to stop doing the bit because the bit works. And even though they know it's unethical to continue to do the bit, because it's really your story that they're repeating, they can't help it because it's so powerful. It's such a, it's such a weapon to use. I'll give you want these people to love you. You want these people thinking of the funniest guy ever. Boom. How about this brilliant impression with this perfect story that is so fucking hilarious. You're going to be holding your stomach laughing. The brilliance of it all.

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       But in reality he shouldn't be saying it and yeah, and yeah, and there's an addicted to killing it is. It's hard man, because bombing sucks and they, and a lot of times people think that bombing is the alternative when it's not, know if the alternative is just not killing. You know. And I think a lot of those, a lot of guys who, uh, especially like, uh, like I remember a tell never killed Amelie. Like he always killed to comics. Like we always loved them. But like a lot of times he'd do 50, 50 in the room. And at the cellar because, because in all honesty, he was working on new shit all the time. He was always taking a bit and it was not about the crowd. It was not about them. He knew if he wanted to, he could murder that crowd in a heartbeat.

Speaker 3:          01:29:44       For him it was about the art and find the right way, how to kill someone with a hammer. Like what's the funniest way to kill someone with a hammer? How do you kill it? Like, and he would, I swear to God, he must've said kill someone with a hammer 150 times as when I lived in New York and tried to work that out and you'd watch him and I'm Louis C K was about, it was about him figuring shit out. I worked with Louis right after Georgia, my old, my oldest was born and, and Dave, right back to back. And Louie and I'm, I'm, I'm saying this in all fondness. Louie bombed for an a weekend. He had a rough weekend. Uh, and he, but he, but he was doing all the material that defined him as a comic today. That is the murderous, shameful hour. What did he did the shameless or shameful shameless.

Speaker 3:          01:30:26       The one that defined the definitive hour of Louis CK where you went, okay, he's my new favorite comic. He was doing all that and he was working on it. For him it wasn't about killing. It was about getting this concept of being a regular guy, thinking your kids or a Dick, wanting to be wanting to eat whatever the fuck you want. Being married to someone who's a little micromanaging, like being kind like B being Louis Ck. He wanted to get that idea out so he didn't give a shit. I remember going up murdering as a feature and then Louie would go up and kind of like struggle and figure out who's figuring shit out and you could definitely see who was working and I remember my head going, I was so fucking impressed that he did not care. I'm, I'm sure he cared about killing. I'm sure that mattered, but I was so impressed that he didn't, he had a bigger goal, you know, he wanted to create new material quickly.

Speaker 3:          01:31:15       Yeah. He wanted to make, he wanted to make, he wanted to change his style. His style was goofy, absurd, you know, kind of. I always, I don't know why, but I think of like top, uh, top 10 fucking humor. For some reason it was like, it was just like goofy's hop tend humor when, I don't know why I say that. I don't know what I mean. But I always thought of that. I don't know. I don't know how else to say it. Oh, do you mean like, um, like one of those like a poll, like top 10 funniest things to happen? Like that kind of humor? No, no, no. It was like, it was top tent. Like a tent. Yeah. Like it was like a tent. Like, I dunno why I think that maybe it's our special had a tense old stuff was it was still a silly goofy. Yeah. Like, yeah, he'd go, uh, his joke was like, I want to see me order anything. A old diarrhea or down diner style diner style. You wanna see a diner style order, ma'am. She got

Speaker 2:          01:32:00       two eggs, Bacon and pancakes. He goes, want something to drink? She's like, orange juice. He goes, all right, I need to monkeys. Right fired car. I need to flapjacks them up later on. [inaudible] [inaudible] need to do this whole fucking hilarious rant. Then he go and I need two eggs over easy bacon and pancakes with some orange juice. Like that was the bit, wasn't who he is now at all. It was more absurdist, but man, I remember watching that and going, motherfucker, I wish I had the balls because I was a feature at the time. I felt like if I didn't kill, I wouldn't work ever again.

Speaker 6:          01:32:29       Yeah. That's like the fear, the fear of the hardest part of coming up with new material or changing gears. You know, God forbid when you get a guy who's like a musical guy and decides to try to put the guitar down. Oh Shit Man, I've seen that go horribly wrong. That's east shore. He used to yell at them. She used to yell at, and there's a series of guys that were guitar comics who I'd like some kind of funny songs, but they resented the fact that they were not considered legitimate comedians by the rest of the comedians. Like they did something that was like a little extra. If you just had to go up there and talk, you really would. You would eat dicks.

Speaker 2:          01:32:58       That's a little like not, I mean, look, here's the thing. You pull out a guitar and everyone's like, Ooh,

Speaker 6:          01:33:04       it's good. Yeah. Nothing wrong with it. Not saying anything,

Speaker 1:          01:33:08       but what, what I'm saying is there was a bunch of guys who've got pretty good with a guitar and then they tried to put the guitar down and just go on their own personality and they would eat the sticks up their butt. Mitzi shore used to yell at them. I'll never forget the student was on stage and he was, he was just choking it up there. I just didn't have it and it just, it was

Speaker 6:          01:33:25       out of rhythm. He didn't know how to another rhythm. Yeah. He didn't know how to, we couldn't just introduce the next song. Next Song I wrote when I was thinking about I dream of Jeannie and bubble bath with my dog. Hey man, you know there's no, there's no setup. It's just you doing stand up and you know, you continue to know there's no guitar to pull out. There's no pretending you're having a good time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You know, soliciting claps. There's none of that. It's just you talking.

Speaker 2:          01:33:48       There's no like a tuning the guitar when you need a, Oh, let me hold on one sec.

Speaker 1:          01:33:52       And so Mitzi, the kids on stage doing this man, as he goes,

Speaker 6:          01:33:56       go get that. Get Joe Amber going stage without the guitar.

Speaker 2:          01:34:04       I kinda wish I had known missy. She's one of a costume meter. Really? Sure. If you want us to meet her. She's, she's in poor health though. She's had a hard time the one time he was a dick. Well, you know, I'm a big fan of his brother. His brother Scott. He's a good buddy of mine. I love that guy. But I said to Paul in front of Louis, Louis Anderson introduced us, always mixed. Louie Anderson Hall, you should be calling, can be a nice guy. He's got the potential to be a nice guy. He just doesn't know his shoes to be totally. And it seems like whatever it is there, it's really weird because every time you meet him and like most of the time it's like, hey, he's just a nice guy. Very Fun Times. And then he has like a bad, weird side, I guess.

Speaker 1:          01:34:44       Yeah, I dunno. You know, whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:34:48       Did you ever choke him out?

Speaker 1:          01:34:49       Me? No. Nope. Never did.

Speaker 6:          01:34:51       I never got. Never even really, I mean I got it more

Speaker 1:          01:34:53       upset with how ridiculous the whole situation, the comedy store. Then

Speaker 4:          01:34:58       Pauline, Pauline was just a part of a machine over there. Yeah. You know, whatever position he plays in it now, I don't know.

Speaker 6:          01:35:04       Speaking of that machine, cyber, so Monday I got machine shirts@burpharbert.com keep going. Fiber sale Monday, cyber sale, Mondale Monday. So what, what happens? What do they get off? They get like a same price as normal, I think. I don't know how to change it. They get same prices on a cyber sale. That's not a fucking cyber sale right now. Cyber sale at [inaudible] Dot Com oh and it put in the code word cyber. You get 25% off and you don't, you don't have a real,

Speaker 9:          01:35:30       I actually think that everyone should go to Doug dicom instead of going to amazon.com that's d

Speaker 6:          01:35:36       you go to d g g e d.com. Brian explained to me why that's good

Speaker 9:          01:35:40       because I go to the, if you're going to shop on amazon.com uh, Doug got calm, just forwards you to amazon.com but any of anytime you spend a dollar I get 6 cents and it goes towards this studio that we're not charging them anymore. Huh? It doesn't charge them any more for the product. I know that gives you a kickback. Just gives it a kickback for promoting people to amazon.com stealing money for themselves. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:36:06       Are we making money on this side of the apocalypse? Because how Amazon's gonna fold. Yeah. I get your shit together. You're my favorite at all. The online shopping.

Speaker 9:          01:36:14       I went to black Friday, by the way, and that was straight up. Scary like that was like, that was like being at, uh, like Woodstock. But if it was like all rappers, I guess, what did you get? What did you get a black Friday? Uh, these projectors that in the background and stuff like that. But it was a, these projectors right here? Yeah. What does this movie?

Speaker 4:          01:36:36       Uh, I don't remember. You have a plane, but you don't know this studio. This studio is starting to become really fucking bad ass.

Speaker 9:          01:36:44       So wait. So now you guys, do you guys, do you do a live show here? Wednesday nights?

Speaker 6:          01:36:51       Uh, we do a live show here on various evenings. We don't, it's not like every Wednesday night anyway, here is to do the podcast. What we do is we do a podcast while we're doing, I just kicked over his camera as, he's still cool. What we do is we do a podcast, like while everyone is going up on stage, the other comics would be back here having a podcast. Oh, come on, please do this anytime you want. What is the next 100% open invocate maybe this week, maybe let's figure it out. We'll figure it out. I'll do it this week. Do it this week?

That's what happened is they are talking about doing is doing something like that on the road with Ustream and like fucking trying to, but I don't, I'm not good with that.

Just random on vacation, the exact moment he was on vacation. He's one of those guys, like I was truly happy to see him. You know, he's a, he's a real legit dude. He's like, so he's the one of the most honest people I've ever met that's in like show business, you know, like he, he came on the show and was telling me a story about his wife passing away. Oh, I heard about, you know, raising his kids and doing the best he can. But he's still us to travel on the road and sometimes you have to leave them and he doesn't want to and how it breaks his heart, you know, it's powerful fucking shit. I love when he, I love the words he chooses. He's got this, he's got like a, like a, a 90 year old man's vocab

Speaker 4:          01:38:38       look. He says words like, tickling, you are Kruna Yo Karuna like a crooner. Who the fuck his feelings on the matter. So it goes, it goes here.

I want to do the Po, I want to do that podcast that you do here. Absolutely. Please do it. So are you in town? This whole went down bird like two weeks. Oh my goodness. Ladies and gentlemen, you are listening to this organically occur. We are making an appointment for Bert Kreischer to be a part of the ice house chronical. I'm going to get a fucking car service out here are the favorite new club here in California. Man, we're, we're doing shows here all the time as often as we can, and we're doing podcasts here all the time as often as we can.

Speaker 4:          01:40:11       Fucking great man. It's awesome to be as Joey Matt Flavor going to be here if he's here. You know, you never know, but you can't call doily dog.

He'll do it for sure. That guy so much. Yeah, it cracks me up, man. He's so fucking, he only did the podcast for like 45 minutes. We're going to have him back on, right? There's like a sports game on. He's like a big sports guy. Yeah, he's a UFC fan. Huge UFC fan them all the time with the UFC and he loves it. He's one of the sweetest guys in this business.

Speaker 1:          01:40:45       One of the coolest things about doing this podcast and one of the coolest things about, you know, just being a comic in La, it's like you get to meet a lot of God. Damn interesting people

Speaker 4:          01:40:52       tell me now I think about

Speaker 9:          01:40:53       our lives in that respect. You know the, all the, the wild stories that you told me you're fucking drinking store with Johnny Knoxville and like just the nutty shit that you've told me in the past. I think about how fortunate you are in comparison to the average person. The average person doesn't have those kind of experiences. The average person does it live. So we're insanely fun a, I get it. I get it when I go on the road because the documentary guys will attest to this and I say this and I say this and I mean it. I get the fans of this podcast come out to my shows in fucking droves, like droves. But here's the most interesting thing is they know I'm a fan of the podcast also, so they end up sitting and talking to me for the entire night. We sit at a bar and end up talking about our favorite podcasts.

Speaker 9:          01:41:36       So we ended up bullshitting about this podcast and then, and then inevitably they're like, what's Joe's house look like? And I just make up some story about talions and fucking what's Italian? Oh, fucking some thing I just made Allen. Yeah, I was fucking talking about Brian. Did you really work for NASA? Okay, well that's cool man. Yeah, look, we love doing this fucking podcast. It's a great, it's a, we were saying, I was saying on the phone with you last night, we had an in depth conversation and I'm saying this podcast has made it, it's so fascinating to be a part of because when I stand on stage, the second I got on stage, I see droves of people in machine shirts all sold. I got two pairs that you got to exhale. I got the sort of the light one, which I prefer a very thin sort of, um, of fabric.

Speaker 9:          01:42:22       Yeah, I've got one that's like a regular cotton t shirt. I prefer the super thin one. It's got a little bit of sexy to it, a little extra sexy. You're the reason those things sell. I swear this documentary, you're the reason Henderson Sjogren's shirt on. I'm not the reason dude. All, I am a, as an antenna that tuned into the greatness that is Bert. That's what it is. We just found you. You know, like I couldn't, I couldn't make you funny. I can't make you interesting, you know, having you on this podcast, it's just, we're lucky. I've never subscribed to the idea that you know, that someone should be happy. You know that they come on someone's show and, and are entertaining as fuck for free for hours. We did. We, we, we, you know, we have the, some really hilarious fucking shows with you, dude.

Speaker 9:          01:43:01       Oh, thank you. I thought it was good. I didn't make you, you made yourself to your you well it but we were talking about last night and it is a neat thing to be a part of because when people, when you stand on state people who love you, so this is the fucking craziest thing. So I go to, we do this special and Amsterdam for showtime. I get on stage and Amsterdam, all Dutch crowd, although it's crowd. Wow. Can I stage and I stand on stage machine fucking 13 people yelling the machine. Am I fucking lying right now? Where's the crew out in fucking Amsterdam. Dude's are have the machine shirt on and they're screaming in the machine. Wow. In Amsterdam now this is, everyone's had a rub you that thing about the podcasts free every week. Yeah. Fucking whelming but it's free and it's everywhere and it will always be free. Yeah. My ads are annoying, but it's always going to be free. Fucking gray pug when you do with a tail is overwhelming. It's one of my favorite interviews I've heard with the tell because especially when you told him he could smoke cause you in all of a sudden Dave start really parking relaxed.

Speaker 6:          01:43:54       Yeah I knew I couldn't, I just turned on the machine and I was like well no big deal. He's, I love him. I you let them smoke and he for him, he a two pack a day guy. So for him it's super hard to elbow. Everybody harassed Doug's Dan hope. Please get after him. Email him, get him on Twitter. Tell him to do the podcast. Wise's he's in town this week cause he's doing the Irvine Improv as close to Dan who's in town this week I'm calling up a fatwa to uh, attack the email of Douglas.

Speaker 9:          01:44:46       Is this the one is this one Colin Quinn tweeted about,

Speaker 6:          01:44:49       did he, did he tweet about it? Colin Quinn's Twitter is so fucking funny. Talk on Twitter has been trolling everybody with this thing about a will Ferrell. Saintly. He stole the idea bill Farrell and do it. A lot of bad drugs. He says bad drugs like you can't see. That's a Colin Quinn joke right there. He was saying, Hey Josh doing a lot of bad drugs and they picked up, they picked it up on the newswire. Right. It's so silly. It's social. You can't see him saying even the vernacular he uses the words he chooses. He had a, he was doing a lot of bad drugs. That's a God damn joke. He's Collin Quinn. The fuck is wrong with you. Bebo Oh, Bobby Kelly, give me the result. I want my mind, man. How do you not know?

Speaker 9:          01:45:31       Brilliant. Bobby Kelly told me the funniest Collin Quinn story. I saw Bobby in New York, we did his podcast, which is coming up next Monday. It's, well, you know what the name of his podcasts, it's really, it was really fun as podcasts called know what news? You know what dad, that's a great name for a podcast. So, uh, so, so Bobby says, have you ever met colonics? I'd never met him, but I love him. I think he's hilarious. And then he, I see Bobby later that night. He Goes, you know, Collin said Hi. And I said, I don't think, I don't think we've ever met. And he goes, well, he was at Gotham the other night and he sat with a guy for 30 minutes and then at the end said, see you later Burt. And the bike guy goes, I'm not Bert. And he was all right, take care of. He thought he was talking to me for 30 minutes, like having a conversation with some guy and the guy. That's hilarious. You Burton, the guy who was, my name's is Burton. He was like,

Speaker 6:          01:46:12       oh wow. So you guys just sat down and talk politics. Maybe ghost man, that goes, Bert, this is what I was talking about. This guy from Syracuse, that's who it is. Syracuse University fired Bernie fine, assistant men's basketball coach for sexually abusing boys.

Speaker 9:          01:46:28       So that, that shit happens all the time now. I mean he molested half of our elementary school. We talked about this on the podcast. His name was filled me up Philips and he would just like walk behind guys and smack them in the butt and he had like this huge bucket of like prizes that were like stupid small toys. And it was like a joke between us in elementary school like, oh yeah, he molested our friend Sean. He molested her frame, Blah Blah. Yeah, true. He really did molest them. Well he didn't just making shit up. No, no. I mean that's what we all believe. But we're on the elementary kids, but then later. But did these kids tell you that he molested them? I don't know how it was one of the things that got the, throughout the whole entire school people, and he has been a rumor, maybe even at an even as well. Even as a kid, we all were like, dude, he totally is so molested and oh wow. And that's crazy. Few years later he got thrown out of school or whatever for a or a or whatever. I don't know. But he got suspended for doing that. But you dodged it. Oh yeah. I wasn't, his kid was too fat.

Speaker 10:         01:47:36       That's a defense mechanism. Joe [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          01:47:40       Oh, make your cell phone. Unpretty you don't feel purely on the inside to make yourself unpretty on the outside. That's how I get out of most of my relationships. And if it goes after five or six years, I just start eating like crazy. He's not lying. He's not lying. There's one point in time, he was at the end of this relationship and he had to weigh almost 300 pounds to six to 63 60 pounds. Yeah. And then told you that. I've done that before where I'm like, I'm just gonna eat a lot and get rid of, get rid of them. That's the most self destruction way to get out of relationship I've ever heard. It's hard, man. How hard is it to break up with somebody that can pass a big test though that if they can last for me being fat then then all right, they deserve it.

Speaker 9:          01:48:20       But it is or what your Dick and deserve. Well me being sad story, thicker, thin bitch. So you do it on purpose is what you're saying. Here's the thing that there are guys in unhealthy relationships right now doing destructive shit to try to push the girl away and, and, and here's the thing that I learned one day in a yoga class. I was in a miserable relationship right before I met my wife. I go to a yoga class and the guy just does that fucking gets in your head. You do the whole class at the very end he goes, so right now when we lay down on the mat, I want you to think what's the one thing that makes you unhappy? I remember thinking this fucking chick, and he's like, you have the power to change that today. Take action. And I went, I can fucking dump her like I was. I can make myself happy right fucking now. So if you're listening and you are thinking to yourself, I'm not happy with my chick, fucking change that shit. Absolutely change what a good mood

Speaker 1:          01:49:12       to do is also is to sit down and give yourself advice. Nobody ever does that

Speaker 9:          01:49:16       self evaluation

Speaker 1:          01:49:18       actually give yourself advice. Say if I was in this situation, what would I say to myself? Because nobody ever does that. There's no, what am I going to do? How am I going to fucking, you would say, what if I was saying this to somebody else? Let me take myself out of it. It's very difficult to do obviously, and you can't be 100% objective. You should get to know you have a situation would sit, sit back and say, how would I advise myself to handle this situation and then fucking foul that man, because that's the person that's thinking clearly. Not You. Now he's looking for a shovel and some lime.

Speaker 9:          01:49:44       Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You've totally fucking right.

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       It's the guy going, that's funny. It's true. You know I never fucking listen to me. You got to go into the isolation tank. I want to go into the isolation. Take really bad. I want to get in the TM two. We should get one here on meditation in the isolation tank. Fucking that's what I want. Get one here. We could do one here, but the only thing is I'm really has to maintain it. You have to make sure we're, what space would we do it? But it at Brian, uh, the isolation tank, uh, that room next door is there where you can rent it out like a sore. But whoa, we could do that. Start off float lab lab is in Venice. If I talked to crash, we'll say we'll talk to the flow. I want to do your license. How would it be? That would be dope.

Speaker 6:          01:50:28       Dope malicious. You know what? I got an idea. I got an idea. I think I might have to open up a business. We're going to open up a tank business. Brian Ryko right next door. Genius. Genius. I can't hear out of my left here. Uh, one of these, because it's not a good headphone. We should get new headphones. Scott Stole Candy. They sent me to them. I keep forgetting to bring them here. They're at my house though, diligently waiting. Did you bring a five HTP with you? Yeah. No, I don't have any with me. I have this big thing at Alpha brain, slow roller myself. My personal goals, and by the way, if you take new mood, this is the five HTP thing and you're taking antidepressants already, it could be a problem and yeah. Yeah. Apparently that's a Dr Site. So they say if you are, cause apparently what I'm Neal Brennan was doing when he came on the podcast and he started taking them out talking about antidepressants and five HTP and hey, you know how it helped him.

Speaker 6:          01:51:26       His doctor told him essentially that what's happening is when you take five HTP and you're already on antidepressants, it's like getting to antidepressants but you'd actually get too much serotonin, which is really crazy because what that means is that five HTP essentially produces much of the same stuff that these antidepressants produce. It's like, it's almost like it's natural antidepressants saying, what about new mood and Stella, I think that works. New Mood and Stella. Oh is it? The beer will stele is a good beer. If you want to let a chick know that your European, yeah,

Speaker 10:         01:52:01       let a bitch know

Speaker 6:          01:52:02       Ben the London three or four times. It's cool. You just got to go the right restaurant. I got friends in London. I got to let them know I got the Lens in London. Yeah, I guess she was made out of kangaroo drink that I'll have a Stella. Stella, I think in the glass is nice. I like it, but it's like a light beer. I S in a glass without skunk light be without Scott. You know what man? Give me one of them bitches. I'll try it. Its role, its rolling stone burden. Fuck this one beer.

Speaker 10:         01:52:30       What are we to be a man of our stature?

Speaker 6:          01:52:37       It's how much you weigh. Two 32 25 I'm like one 90 we can. We can. Yes. Nice Brian. Thanks Brian.

Speaker 4:          01:52:46       You're a fucking gentlemen. Now I got to go back and have a conversation with my wife and my daughters. It's not gonna be half as an entertaining. Oh it's going to be fine. My daughter's last night. That's what pop comes in and makes it even more interesting. Again, I'm trying to help you try to help you burn. We're going to turn you into a pothead. It's going to help you. Let's do it. Here's my friend. Cheers to uh, to uh, to a great stem. The studio to great new students. How do you say the last name? Ah, like, like already full quad Artois. It's okay. It's got like sediment as a bottle ban or would good. Um, you know, what's your favorite bit for Sam Adams? Heineken. I'm a Heineken guy and if I didn't get a high, if I get sponsored behind again, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I remember one time some Budweiser guys asked me, they were like, how much time, how much would it cost to get that Budweiser out of your hand and put a Heineken or on stage or get that Heineken in your hand, put a Budweiser and on stage. Wow. And I was like, can't do it. So you would only drink Budweiser on stage. Just drink Budweiser on stage. I did. I did it deal with Jamison. I didn't deal with Jameson. Jameson for two years. Much crazy shit though. I don't think Budweiser. No, no, they don't.

Speaker 2:          01:53:54       You seen the commercials look at their super bowl commercials. It's pretty much what you think of when you're taking a shit. Maybe. What, what, what Superbowl commercials are you talking about that you think of what you'd taken a light or Budweiser commercial commercial. Pretty ridiculous

Speaker 4:          01:54:08       versus sponsor to the UFC. So I have nothing but love for Bud light. There was that Brock Lesnar was, they got nothing on. Yeah, well he was just, he kinda like made a joke. He was trying to be, he's trying to be as character, you know, like he's, he's, you know, the heel from pro wrestling's big fucking wrestler guy. He's selling himself. He's doing a smart thing, you know, so he just fucked up. He shouldn't have said that, but he just fucked up. But Bud light was like the first big sponsor to step in and support the UFC. So I'll always be a bud light fan just for that. It sounds ridiculous, but that's a big move, man, for a company to take a big chance like that and step in.

Speaker 2:          01:54:41       Do you out on sports for Awhile? Yeah, dude, I remember hearing this shit and being like, God, did you guys go through that honey brown stage where everyone was drinking honey brown and killing it? Brian, you always do this.

Speaker 4:          01:54:54       You always change the subject. When we start talking about MMA immediately while we were talking about beer to us, we were, but people on line and going to get angry with you every time you do it.

Speaker 2:          01:55:02       So when, when I worked for Jamison, I worked for James from for two years. Did the Jamison tour me, Billy Gardell, Steve Byrne, my goal, Loftus, Nick Griffin and Danny Bevins and you, they sent cases at Jamison to your house every fucking month they sent cases of pace is of Jamison nug Spence chicks. But kids drink it all and know when you got to, we show Jamison waiting in the green room. Oh, and the rule was you had to drink Jamison onstage. You had to mention how good your Jamison was, but put it on the show. Like take a set like Dan has good fucking Jameson like, and you had to like, hey everyone today, like you had to be pro Jamison. I got no problem with that. Cause Jameson is pretty God damn good. It's fucking awesome. Good Shit. We get done the tour.

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       Are you ready for this? They buy us each of them acre of land in fucking in Ireland on a river. All of us right next to each other. We'd get a fucking Acre land, a deed and a picture. Whoa. Yeah. Fucking Jamison was one band. You got to build a house in Ireland now you can't build, you can't build on it. Build on it. It's fucking pointless.

Speaker 6:          01:56:02       Can you camp on it? You can camp on it. Yeah, they can be to him. Billy Garden be permanent. Can you have a present tent? Yeah, but me and a bunch of psyches be fucking t w O. Pikeys. Yeah, dude, I've been obsessing about watching these Irish travellers fights to me. Some of the uncles, oh my God, they have some of the best fights, dude, you got to Brian, you've got to look this up. They're boring as shit. I mean most of these guys, but they're tough guys and everything. But there's a different style of fighting when you fight bare knuckle and literally they stand there for lunch themselves in the face. It's not like a street fight like you've seen in the states have used that one's they challenge each other and they challenge. He said, I'll tell you that Johnny. Johnny Mac. Yeah. Good for nothing.

Speaker 6:          01:56:41       That's how you get a good fun happen and yet, cause I've got bosses Heidi off at all. I have to tell you right. Don't know. Fight. I'll fight cha anytime before Christmas. Any time a hawker center, there's a beauty, there's a video of, of a pikey driving to a street. They said, well meet what do be a quarter of the clique to rise it up here is it? And then whoever knows that one between me cause I, I tweeted it a while ago. It's really hilarious. But I can't find it in my Twitter while the show is going on. But I, I want to play it because it's so, it's so ridiculous. He something really disturbing Irish travelers. Then there they were talking shit before a street fight. It's even better than the actual fight.

Speaker 3:          01:57:16       Most disturbing pikey video on there is most disturbing one. Every week someone's listening that knows exactly what I'm talking about it please tweet it to Joe and me and Brian, it is pikey gets what he deserves and it's a bunch of a British school. Kids in a park having beers, snorting coke, smoking weed and a pike. You will comes up and he won it, but it's all done post. It's a, it's a recount of the British kid going, so a little pikey comes up and he wants to little drink. He wants a thing. I didn't do this and that. Well we tell them it's cocaine, but guess who just got a nose full of k, a special k and they cut in the pike. He is fucking seizuring on the ground. It's bulky, sketchy. It breaks your heart because you go, that guy's helpless. He's in a k hole right now.

How many ways can you use these? John was going to use these shirts coming off

Speaker 6:          02:02:42       the shirt coming off as a strange move. Cause especially it guess it's it. I don't give a fuck move. It's like that white rapper that I was talking about earlier. Who is it takes his shirt off. It's like, oh do Kumu. Fuck the guy with Birdman. I don't know. But he didn't give a fuck. His whole thing was that he didn't give a fuck. Well this guy basically is doing the same thing. He doesn't give a fuck. It takes his shirt off. He knows he's fat. I love it. He knows he's not pressing shirt comes off. That's when the fucking postop Phil Baroni under there. You know, that's not a, that's not a young Randy coture. Come on son.

Speaker 9:          02:03:10       What are you looking at now, Brian? You're looking at funerals, bagpipes, and buttholes. It's like bottles. Put the bag.

Speaker 6:          02:03:17       It's grown, man. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm fucking, what's that guy's name? Big Junctions only answers big John McCarthy. That guy's name was Brian is that guy's name?

Speaker 6:          02:03:43       so I'm never gonna remember that guy's fucking, I'll, I'll, I'll send it to you. I'm trying to see if I can send it to you right here from my phone. There's gotta be a way. Me

Speaker 9:          02:03:49       Too. Yes. God. That's what's great about the Internet. I would ask you what your email is, but then the whole world would know it and you think about changing a bunch of black dicks in the mail. I just had to fucking pay for new, more g space. Really? Yeah. And that's just disgusting to me that it's gusting from penis pictures or sending out, no, it's, I think it's from just sitting a lot of movie files, video files and stuff like that and I wish I could like just be like, hey, let me download it all immediate like in one file and then erase everything. Right, because it's only five, five bucks a year. But still it's like if you stop paying it and then it takes away that space, that extra 20 gigs they would pay for every year. It's kind of a trick. And then if that keeps on going, that's going to be like a gas price thing and like in 70 years we're going to be paying like $5,000 a month for g mouse space.

Speaker 2:          02:04:38       I think you get out of hand with the oldest that Google has everything for free. They'll control the monetary system of the world and it is. She made them, they will be our overlords. Do you really truly believe that Brian did? You know, I think it is a trick that that they make you pay for a 20 gigs Esther a year. And if you don't pay, yeah, but if they don't, if you stop paying for it, then they just, what the elite the last year of your Gmail, it's kind of like, why should they give you so much storage? That seems like the type of stores that have propelled. Why? You know, why they know why they should. Because I got just make a second gene, Gmail for free and a third g mail and a fourth g mail. Telling them right now he's given me what does that against the law, giving away the secrets, man.

Speaker 2:          02:05:23       You know what I'm saying now? What do you think about the latest and Google phones? Because I've been having these Google phone versus iPhone conversations again lately. We stopped with this. It's like the downed that's supposed to know exactly what you go by your fucking phone and you'll know and like an hour and month you'll be back to the iPhone. I know 100% you would 100% what if I like looking at big pictures? I want a big pictures. Big carry your iPad around on a sling like he used to battery. Fuck. Oh Fuck Joe. That's the next money maker right there. Uh, I want you to come out with man like Ma fanny packs mainly fanny pack. I got one right here. We have a um, uh, higher primate fanny pack. Nevermind.

Speaker 2:          02:06:06       Most ridiculous. One of all time back is more like a survival camp. It's good for cameras. It's tough. You carry too much of a guy on the field that needs like a belt bag. It's like, it's too ridiculous for a fanny pack. It's a guy at work. I don't know. It's pretty tough. I like it a lot. It's still sexy with it on though. Yeah. I don't feel bad cause I think it looks so ridiculous when you're around. Your girl just looks like Gi Joe Style. Like it's not like when you look at fanny pack you're like, all right, that's just lame. This to me it's like more like, oh, he's his guy. A good camera and some stuff in there. You know what it looks like to me it looks like the big bad wolf. I'm going to put it on right now with the big data set. I started watching that show grim on Sundays. Grim. We, when we, are you ever going to talk about your new show coming out? What? Fairfax? Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk about it. I'm fucking, are you, are you excited?

Speaker 2:          02:06:54       It's going to be fun. It's a funny show. Everyone I talked to [inaudible] excited for it. I don't know if there's one episode where I'm not sure if they're going to be able to aerate. They haven't decided yet. Are you serious? It's so crazy. It's so ridiculous. Like when I heard that we were doing it, look, I'm, let me tell you something. The way they're filming it, the, the, the stunts, everything is like way more over the top than before. Let's stuffy a way bigger and it's a, it's very strange looking at Brian. Brian's gotta succeed. That's your fanny pack Brian. Yeah, look at that. That's like a survivor gear sort of a thing that is a whole, that is a fucking shooter in the field. Fanny pack. You could do some serious, but traveling with that though, you know, that's a good move for the airport dude. So you can film us going through the airport. A lot of foam that though, right?

Speaker 4:          02:07:36       I don't know. We're trying, we're going to fill him in the airport. The Tsa, they allow you to film the, he was saying they use another camera. The other camera is the 70 and it's a little more, uh, it looks like a film like it will you just walk around with a, your, you're knocking. It looks like you're carrying a fucking camera. This is one of the most shocking things about traveling in Europe is you realize how much more lax they are on security. They're much more relaxed. It's much easier to travel there. Oh, I flew in very nice and friendly and easy going. It's not, it's not nearly as investigative as when you land in America. Oh God. You know, I fucking, when I flew from London to La and coming down in London was a cakewalk and, but man coming in to, here's the worst part is what was the problem?

Speaker 4:          02:08:19       They asked you a lot. But the biggest, the biggest problem really was I don't, I wore so many different outfits in Amsterdam evening wise and I had so many fucking chaotic nights that I didn't know what was in what pocket. And I literally packed and I was like, I'm pretty sure I'm clean, but who knows who fun. And did they know you coming from Amsterdam? Uh, uh, no. I took a train, I took a drink and I'm like flying. I took a train from London, Amsterdam and then took a train back from Amsterdam and London. It doesn't show on your, um, no. They asked where I was and I told him Amsterdam and they said, why? I said vacationing and here's the kicker. I had like a $30 Cuban cigar and I was like, fuck it. I'll just roll with it. I'll take it home and smoke it at home. It's a Cuban cigar butt. Take the wrapper off. They'll never fucking know. And I told my dad and my dad goes, don't fucking do it to $250,000. Fine. If they catch you with it, well they could move it. They cannot prove it. If you just stick to your guns and say it's Dominican, I'm going to fold like a cheap sheet. I'll be like the, I'll be like, the opposite of Kaiser says

Speaker 2:          02:09:16       is your, so they take me away. I didn't mean to. Oh Man. I don't even know.

Speaker 4:          02:09:22       That's a good cigar man. Why don't you want to give it up to the man? I have to give it up. I don't fucking ruined even if 10 grand, if they said, all right, well let your weight with 10 grand fucking puts a dent in my family. Yeah, it is kinda crazy how all the rest of the world is allowed to buy cigars from Cuba but not us. And Man, it tasted so good. Assholes. We're still mad at, you know, they're letting us buy land. Cuba. Would you buy land in Cuba? Uh, why? Why did I do that? I don't know.

Speaker 2:          02:09:47       Overwhelming need to go to Cuba and plant things. If you're an n of murderers anywhere that I wouldn't want to live, what would you do you imagine? What are you milling the way? Hemingway in the fifties ready to make your own hotel out there and have the mob come down and run everything again. Good old days is

Speaker 4:          02:10:06       a lot of people in Cuba. I bet long for the good old days and the mob was running shit. Oh, that must've been nuts, man. Mom Brung Cuban, the 1950s you know, when you think about like what those motherfuckers were in to back then, you know like, like Kennedy, how Kennedy like almost flaunted his, you know, friendships with all these high level celebrity entertainment figures. And you know how all these hot chicks are on them all the time. Talk about rule list like lawless, go to Cuba,

Speaker 2:          02:10:34       right in the what? Fifties sixties Oh my God. Okay. Let's try to think. Well, what point would they prosecute you? Like you could kill someone totally in Cuba then. Yeah. Oh, of course. And what to you guy has got to, I don't know, Cuba's history enough to know who's the most corrupt. It was the most corrupt before, before, before Castro. Even when Castro came in. Technically. But Eddie Bravo is a huge Castro fan and so is Joey Diaz. You sit down with Joey D's helped break it down for you forever about Castro, the good and the bad. Really? Yeah. It says, you know Joey was born in Cuba. He was born in Cuba. Yeah. He was born in Cuba and came to Miami, came to America when he was really young. Shut up. Yeah. Joey Diaz is a real deal. That's why he doesn't really know how old he is really chilled.

Speaker 2:          02:11:18       Yeah. Joey Diaz in Bert Kreischer have a lot in common. You know, we both deal to be a really, really funny person. There's like a certain level of unconventionality a certain, a certain frequency of vitals. Give a fuck that has to be reached. Yeah. Not everybody can reach that, you know? So when the guy comes along like you and reaches it like that, you're like, oh wow. He just took a fucking pill from Johnny Knoxville. 12 shots he just did. He's a number one party animal for rolling what? You know what I mean? Like, yeah, they just, you know, there needs to be an event that throws you the conventionality. After that rolling stone article, there was nothing I could do. I wasn't going to get a straight job. Who the fuck's gonna hire a guy that took his shit on a pizza box and won an election? Important man. It's important. It's important for people to push the issue.

Speaker 9:          02:12:05       I'd never had a, I never had a happier day in my life. Brian and I were driving him to your house or from your house one night, one day. And Brian and Joey called Brian and Brian and they started talking on the speaker phone. Comfortable cause you brought it up while I was in the car and I just felt like I'm dropping. So I just said, I go, Hey, uh, we're talking. You go, hey Joe. If he goes, hey wait guy at Joey Diaz, I'm just want you to know I'm in the car, I'm in the car. I just want you to know I don't like, God forbid they go. And you know who's on the podcast today by mark. I see him, I see it. But it was I'm, but I've listened to so much of the podcast. I go, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, Joey, I'm in the car. I just want you to know that. And Joey Diaz, just real smooth goes, I might shit. I was like the machine.

Speaker 2:          02:12:48       Well good. The great you know, you, you and

Speaker 9:          02:12:52       common speaker phone. It's weird though. Like that right though. Do you get calls a lot Joe, when you're like, you have to announce it to the Colorado.

Speaker 2:          02:12:58       Oh yeah. I don't want it to anybody so fucked up. Fuck. I always told my wife not to say the n word for it. Unfortunately. You already said that on a previous video blog. Did I fuck? Let's get that fight video wrap up for Joe for a big Joe Davy. All right. No, let's shoot mine. Oh, oh, in your video. I'm ready to fucking challenge him. Your stance that he's a dead, you know good Boston. No, I'm going to go to ocs. Them fighting. Is this, this is the video you told me to search for it earlier or no, this isn't a thing. This isn't it. All right. Well that seems like a cool fight. Videos. Yeah, it does. If you just type in Pikey, you'll find so much great shit. Snatch snatch. Is it? Yay. Is it gay? If you put a picture of shirtless Brad Pitt in fight club in your man cave, so it inspires you to work out.

Speaker 2:          02:13:48       Absolutely not. That's what I'm talking about. That movie is awesome. Not that I'm doing that, but I have a friend who's thinking about doing, I think it's awesome. What do you, you love him as the ideal build? Is that what it is you'd like to look like? Look like that? Why can't you do it? Uh, I'm trying. I'm trying to. Ours, we've got like a maniac. I'm trying, I'm working on book like crazy. I'm not eating this grass fed meat. Thanksgiving kind of threw a wrench in my work around like a fucking savage lift. A lot of weights to trick your body into thinking that it has to do this all the time. Had a bench press and the fucking hotel the other day in New York fucking pounded out high school strong like one 35 I'll do they shit 10 times, 10 times, 10 times. Now what are you going to do?

Speaker 2:          02:14:23       You're going to just touch the bench. Commit to like a serious weightlifting program and weightlifting and running. I'm running hardest shift for an hour and I'm lifting weights, push ups, plank. I just want my body to be, I got to get my blood pressure low, lower, and I want, I just want to be healthy. I don't want to be a fat old man. I want to live. I want to look. I don't want to look skinny. I don't want to look perfect, but I want to look like I want to take my shirt off at the beach and go, I bet he has an active lifestyle. You know what I mean? Instead of saying like, I saw the way your belt, like when you showed your tattoo, your belt doesn't, it holds your pants up. It doesn't define your waistline like, does that make sense? I see what you're saying.

Speaker 2:          02:15:01       Like my belt cuts into my fat. You have me to under my pubis and my stomach. Sometimes it bleeds. You have to put a little neosporin on it. There's no bandaid. It cuts into you. It's corn syrup. The government government cards here, it's cholesterol, trans fats. That's what it is, man. It's the government keep me a fat and stupid. No and no time in history of people who've been fatter. I don't think there's ever been a time of history where the numbers of people who've been fat like in this country, the numbers are gigantic by Fatman use get respect in the 20s when you were buster Keaton and you were fat. They're like, how did you do that? That's why you were a movie star. Like, yeah, Babe Ruth. Oh, I'm here. Everybody was like, he must have a lot of money. Yup, Babe Ruth, who's eating steaks and hot dogs and drinking beer.

Speaker 2:          02:15:47       He's living high on the hog and then now you're just fat. You just, it looks like you're poor and don't care. Let it looks like you just unhealthy and then you just have a poor diet. Had No connection with your personality anymore. Such a direct connection between what you put into your body and how your body feels mad and some people just, I have friends, I got a buddy who's on antidepressants and he eats terrible. He's fucking die. It's awful. I think it's lack of women. I think like the old days used to have a wife and they used to cook for you, like he's nice meals and stuff. To me, half the time I'm like, okay, a Jack in the box is open. A subway is still open. You know, it's, it's more of like I'm more rushing around. I, if I were to come home like, oh, you know like family dinners style, you have to kitchen table and you're in your, she's like, oh, I made a casserole. You like, wow, that's,

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       you've been watching too many patty Duke movies. That's how I grew up. That's how you go. You grew up. That's how I grew up. I had family dinner every day. I hadn't, you know, we all sat at one table, still have family dinners bro, and they were super unhealthy. I mean a family. Then it doesn't necessarily make it healthy. What, what the real problem is, is most people have terrible dot. A woman in the is, what I'm saying at the house certainly helps men. That definitely helps. If you live with someone, if you have kids, even, you know, you all like have good food in the house, you know, you want to make sure everything's supply. When I lived alone, I ate out every fucking night of the week. Oh. If I lived alone, I'd be in great shape. Yeah. When I lived alone, I was just a comedian and a TV show in the morning. Some way in restaurants, restaurants, everywhere. For breakfast, lunch, dinner. I would keep some food at home just to eat when I was starving or if I was writing or something like that. For the most part, I just went somewhere to eat, you know? Why would I cook? I don't have time for that shit. What's the one thing you miss about being single the most?

Speaker 6:          02:17:25       No, no, no ma'am.

Speaker 3:          02:17:27       I don't miss new pussy at all because there was always a, I had to do a song and dance to explain why that didn't go the way they thought it would. Like I would never, oh that's so sad. That first new pussy experience you had where you would go in and you'd get on top and you were like, all right, this is going to happen really fast. And you knew that in your head you're like, the whole thing I'm trying to do is make this not prolonged this moment so that she thinks it's somewhat enjoyable.

Speaker 6:          02:17:54       The only good parts about being single are that you can have sex with more than one person. The only bad parts of being single are that you're lonely and you're single and it's way better to have a relationship. It's way better. But the problem is we're fucking a wired to want to have sex with other women. So it's becomes life becomes a matter of managing your desires and managing which ones manifest themselves into the real world because they can cause a lot of negative energy and they can cause a lot of arguments and they can cause a lot of lonely nights. Like you gotta like look at like what is the most logical plan of attack to have a happy life. And what is the most logical attempt to have a wild, chaotic roller coaster bride of those chaotic nights were then,

Speaker 3:          02:18:41       well, you're standing on top of a corner of a building in New York and the sun's coming up and you've got to fucking girl from Liverpool next to you who's tongue stuck to the bottom of her mouth. And she's like, oh well I need a more normal pack of cigarettes. What turns his door open? That fucking shit. When you

Speaker 6:          02:18:54       find yourself fucking in a parking lot in the middle of downtown Manhattan, you find yourself just doing crazy shit. Yeah. But you know, ultimately it's fun. But the real problem with single being single, the real problem is meeting cool people. It is fucking hard, man. It is hard to find the real person. You got to go out with them for awhile and you got to talk about controversial subjects. You have to, you know, you have to, to get to know him and know how their brain is for a lot of fucking fools when you're saying, my goodness, you put a nickel for every night talk. And I watched

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       this guy on a date once, and I'll never forget this, I was, I was, they were to a table next to us and the guy was talking with this girl and the girl's talking about her dog and how her dog is so used to the finest automobiles and Mercedes Benz and you know, and she was like going off about her dog, that if she ever tried to bring her dog in a taxi cab, she doesn't think her dog would go in. And then she was like, it was, it was just chaos. God. And I was just imagining like, could you imagine if you get just stuck sitting down to this next to this fucking dummy and you're actually having this conversation and she's not being a joke. She's not being ironic, not being hilarious. Like that could be a hilarious statement. You know, if you were, if you're, you know, being a silly person, just joking around, she wasn't joking around, she was bragging about all the finest automobiles that her dog rides in God. And it was just like, what kind of nonsense conversation would you have with this person? That's the real issue with being single as people don't want to be single. You want to have someone that you could spend time with. But what are the odds of finding someone who's actually fucking cool?

Speaker 2:          02:20:31       It's, it's, I mean I'm, I met fucking a hundred uncool people before I met someone. Cool.

Speaker 1:          02:20:35       Of course. And then it's also a matter of what you bring out of that person and would, that person brings out of you because you, you'll behave completely different in one relationship than another.

Speaker 2:          02:20:44       And why would they ship you a totally different guy? I was bad and all my relationships, but he cheated. Fucking yelled never was. I wasn't a good guy. I wasn't like, I didn't listen, didn't give a shit. And then when I met, my wife thinks just changed for the better and I was like, all right. I remember thinking to myself, I stayed single for a long time and then I was like, I'm the fucking problem in all of these failed relationships. I'm the Charlie Sheen like, well to be a Bert Kreischer to be the fucking party animal you, you, you know you're going to crack a few eggs. You got to Piss on a dining room table every now and then. Fucking shit's got to go. Sometimes you got to rub off on the trains and that's the only way you make it.

Speaker 1:          02:21:20       The Guy who's is funny, as you are in this form of the podcast, you know the stories is brilliant stories. You have to, I mean they, you know, you're funny on stage comes from years of craft and working on writing and performing and stuff, but your, your ability to just tell these fucking stories, you know, on the podcast, that's why you are created the way you're created. That's why your life's been so chaotic and insane. It's to create this amazing product because a diamond doesn't get made unless you have a mountain pressing up against a piece of coal and fucking smashing the shit out of me for a million years. That's how you make a fucking diamond. You know you don't make a Bert Kreischer was like a normal

Speaker 2:          02:21:57       childhood, no alcohol, no drugs. And when they say, do you want a shot? You say, no thanks. I think I'm to get some sleep. You know when somebody gives you a pill, they give you two pillars. You like at least gonna swallow. One. I cannot fucking bang with the guy I got to take one. At least swallowing was, man, you're not, you're not completely fucking around here. The best part about Johnny Knoxville is I ran into him at California chicken cafe one day, like fucking five years later. And I'm sitting there and he walks in. He's obviously, he's famous at the time he's been doing, and he walks in, I go,

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       Johnny Knoxville, and he looks at me Real Cretney real quick. And he goes, Bert Kreischer, I went, shut the fuck up. And he goes, the number one party animal, the country. Oh, what the fuck are you doing out here? And I was like, is the fucking greatest guy? And his whole fucking posse was at California chicken cafe. And I was like, oh, I wonder if they'll invite me over me. Them. I want to meet Steve. Oh, that's awesome. Does he ever done stand up? No. He's, he's a, he's, he's, he could tell stories. Yeah. He seems like he could do stand up. He should do the podcast. Oh, it'd be awesome. Steevo was fucking awesome. That was he, why did he go in at one dude, he was in the Ice House. Chronicles number three I need to subscribe to Tivo was, first of all, he's cool as fuck.

Speaker 4:          02:23:05       But second of all, his fucking experiences, dude, he was on a tree and I'll lie in, climbed up the tree and got on time. Saw that on TV. And that was the craziest thing I've ever seen in my fucking life. Dude. I Tamed Lions. But I saw that you did what a damn lions for birth to conquer did. Yeah, I was, no, we shot it, but it never aired. The show got canceled. Like right after that we shot that, the fight in the bear and then tailoring the lions and then the show got canceled. The guy tells me he goes, how long ago was this? And this is seven years ago, I guess. So 2004 video exist. Uh, Mark Cronin as it somewhere. I'm sure dude released that shit on the Internet with fucking, it was, it was a bizarre fucking taming lions was a nicer you, you have video of you with a full grown lion, like an actual three full grown lion.

Speaker 4:          02:23:58       Three full grown Lyons and he brings them out of this. I'm more crone and let's get ahold of them. Yeah, I know. Mark, do you have his phone number? Do you ever, I know more gorilla. He was my boss for like, he did produce the x show on Fx. Love to see that video, put that video. He fighting the bear and getting fucking raped by a bear and then meet him in three lines. How much money do you think, if that got a million hits, how much money do you think that someone would make if they had like those youtube ads? I don't think I've got a million hits. I don't know. That's a really good question because I heard that like Rebecca Black check that girl that made that Friday, Friday song that everybody's going to blu ray, but it had like an unbelievable number of views.

Speaker 4:          02:24:34       Like something like 35 million plus. I mean what's the name? You know who would know is, what's his name? John? It's totally no. Yeah, I don't think he's going to tell you how much money's making. Yeah, I wonder man, cause I would, I would think that if you could make getting millions of hits, boy that's probably, I mean to that video though, Fox owns the rights stones all asked them to do, I asked him to do a DVD so it's like them to release it and put an ad on it. They can make some money. Why not go? Maybe it'd be worth it for them to do it that way. I'm just thinking like how much for for you know, how much does it like a million hits pay in a youtube ad? I don't know. I've never, I have no clue. And it's interesting that that sort of, you guys would have, how much, how many hits did you get on the mindset of a democratic version of a television channel? Really when you think about it, I mean you, you really not want to say democratic, but an open version of it.

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       Cause it's like, like there's guys like our friend from the message board that d six Kid that guys' videos have millions of hits, right? Doesn't mean millions, millions of hits. And he's, he's got ads on those. So I mean you gotta be making a few dollars here and there. I don't know how much it is, but essentially like this is like one step in a multistep process of, you know, like exactly what we're doing here. The podcast, being able to make your own shit like and not need a travel channel or a, an NBC or anything to produce something like it's so he could do it all through the online and having it online is actually like reaches more people than the networks. Cause eventually going to happen. I mean how many times do you watch something and I'm in full screen on your laptop or on your uh,

Speaker 4:          02:26:08       desktop now, like a view to video and you see it as like cool definition. It's the first four episodes of Pan Am on my computer and I was like, watch Soto Margarita there. There's a fight that's coming up and they had that 24, seven and I watched it on beach. And you go to Hbo, go on your Ipad, you can watch anything that's ever been on HBO, anything for free. Wow. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? I went down to watch the entire life, all the fights while the fucking, all the, what is 24, seven again, Hbo, Hbo Go. You have to have, obviously you have to have an HBO subscription, but you ha you just log in. We show it like it. You can watch anything they ever bored to death, entourage, fucking boardwalk, empire soprano's, Kali specials, every one's comedy specials, anything that's on there, you can watch it.

Speaker 4:          02:26:56       And I'm like, how the fuck is showtime not have that? How does Cinemax not have that? That was one of the greatest, sure. Eventually they will just, Hbo got there first and Hbo is on top of that shit because I'll put that on my iPad and go on the elliptical. I know it sounds Kinda busy, but go on the elliptical and which feels better than running better on my knees. Smart and he can go hard. Man can go hard with the elliptical or very casual and watch a board to do what you do sometimes. So, uh, but men, it's the best. It just streams live. My daughters, this is how crazy this has happened. My daughters, we have, we have fucking more TV's in our house than we could ever. We have two in the man cave, three in the, in the house. And my daughter's sit in front of the computer every morning and my wife's little office and watch a Netflix.

Speaker 4:          02:27:35       They stream this live. Next stage we need to set up a podcast headquarters. Let inside Bert Kreischer his man cave. Let's do it. Let's do it. I'm in for it. Brian. You said it. I'm going to set it up. He's too busy. Stop it. You're going to have to get your own guy and eat your own Brian. But we'll set up just to hang out at karaoke bars. And Karaoke bars are a great place to start. A lot of good sound guys. Go to karaoke bars. Get A, um, a setup. So you could just podcast anytime you want. So you're sitting at home, you hide in your man cave at one o'clock in the morning and have a couple of beers by yourself. You can just start talking into a microphone. Just ranting and, and can, you can stream it live, right? Sure. You can use treatment. Absolutely. It's a beautiful qstream and you can do it just like we're doing it here. I'm doing it also goes to MP three [inaudible] name it. Let's name it Zune. Did you say you're buying a Zune?

Speaker 4:          02:28:27       Is the MP three recorder Bro. That's the one that Ari Irish years and then I'm getting a, and I got a good camera right now, so I put up one shot. What do we name it? Well, yeah, that's exactly, I was going to say, what do we call this thing? The machine in the man cave. That's not bad. That's not bad. Machine in the man cave was not fucking bad, but the only thing I would think of as you would want people to be able to, well what the fuck with Mark Marin? I don't machine the man cave. I don't know if I want people finding Bert Kreischer because a lot of travel channel's going to be fucking super happy about me making another TV outcast. You're not getting paid for it. You're doing it for your fans. You're doing it because you're an entertaining motherfucker and people want to hear you talk all the time and look what we're doing right now.

Speaker 4:          02:29:12       There's a lot of people right now that are in their cars. There's a lot of people at the gym. There's a lot of people that making some bumpy. We're taking the train in and commuting to New York, right back out the jersey. Exactly. And Boring as fuck. It drives him nuts and you can bring a little chill. I'm doing it. I'm doing it like my man cave and I'm, I am getting on this ship before I go back on the road to Chicago. There you go. I'm getting on this shit. I'm making it happen. So the machine in his man cave, I dunno, I dunno. But the travel channel is only going to like it because it's only going to promote your show more. Yeah. You know, it's like, why would it, why would it hurt? It's not going to hurt bro. Play. It's just like it on Facebook.

Speaker 4:          02:29:49       Yeah, Dude. Just, yeah. Your online presence right now, it's just starting to blossom. You know, if you have your own podcast, you'd be straight one and shit. Bert Kreischer my right Brian. Yeah, mother Fucker crusher. I think you should just do it here though. I don't think you should do it in your man cave. Well, you could do it here, you know, but yeah, but Brian's, it's the easiest way. I like to be a little buzzed if I'm going to do it. Sometimes that's what the couch is for. Yeah, I know, but what am I spend the night here. You want to cuddle with Brian? Sorry girls. Daddy's a death squad. I can't make at home. How cool that sentence sounds. Do it. Daddy's a death squad. That's the name of that watch to tell everybody because people always ask, what are these fucking squat? Where does death squad name come from?

Speaker 4:          02:30:30       You guys call yourselves to death squad. The sucker shoot over. Oop, oop. From opie and Anthony, I came into the studio and it was with my friend Eddie Bravo. No Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. First man to ever tackled first American ever. Topic, Gracie and Tate, Tate Fletcher, you know, 205 pound fighter from the ultimate, uh, from the ultimate fighter. I was there, Brian was there and he's obviously a killer, so probably have not. Yeah. And so, you know, oop, looks at it. He goes, it's Joe Rogan Brian the death squad. You know, and we just started joking around y'all bro, with a dust squad like just as a goof. And it became, now it's like one of those words like, like you hear it, you know, you hear death squad and he'd go, that is the douchey exist. Most grow a dump, but to us it doesn't even have that same meaning anymore.

Speaker 4:          02:31:19       That's why the logo balances it out. Yeah. The logo with the cat. It's like when you're, it's like when you and your friends just a name, when you and your friends heard a bunch of douchebags saying like, Bro, Ham and spring break and then you started calling each other bro him as a joke and then all of a sudden you start calling you up to other bro him for real. Yeah. Like pro him. And he's like, what's up bro? Im like, oh fuck no. Are random white guys, those random white guys I'm doing it. Just squat sounds the douchey best thing ever, but it's just a a group of Nice people. It's a group of Nice people that want to make you laugh. I don't know why that's a Douchey, douchey name. Just sort of balances it out. Otherwise we'd be two fe. We'd be taken advantage of. People would stomp all over us. They wouldn't do it. And Fierce Bert Kreischer people. Firas Bert Kreischer does. Any message you want to give to the young people, the world. What is it? What have you learned in your time on this planet? My friend.

Speaker 4:          02:32:12       Just take half. Just take half. Yeah. Don't want to Overdo it with drugs. Just take one. Take half. Just take one or two. Take one. That's sound advice. Sound advice. My advice would be pretend you're taking it, spit that bitch and the glass. Wait a few hours to see if nobody dies. People die. But the problem is then when you do take it, if nobody dies, then unfortunately you're going to be like last one to the party. You know, you last one to the k hole. Oh Man. Everybody will be coming out and you'll be sliding in.

Speaker 3:          02:32:42       Uh, one time, uh, this is fucking right after college, we go to a, we go to a strip club, I'm living in New York. We go to a strip mine, one boy, he's getting married in Atlanta and everyone gets ecstasy. So we go to this with this bus, this big fucking party bus, and we're going to the strip clubs in the hood and the swots. And uh, it was just when outkast came on with that song, uh, everybody moved to the back of the bus and they were playing it on repeat and everyone took ecstasy and everyone was taking it. And they gave me one and I was like, oh, I'm going to take it. And then at the last minute I went, I'm not going to take it. I don't want to take, actually tonight, I'm think I'm cool. And then 35 minutes, everyone was started fucking going. Flipper just passing out. And I was like an where they were moving bodies. I remember liber like going

Speaker 4:          02:33:27       like season, like yeah, having seizures and they go fucking fall down. Whoa. Just had an instinct to not take it. I remember it was in the bathroom. I had to be pulled and I was just like, I don't want to take ACCC, man. I'm fine. I'm, I was past that phase in my life and I was like, I'm not going to fucking take it. I see. But they've given it to me and I was like, I have in my hand to that kind of changed your life. You got brain damage from that. Well, the, all my friends now are fucking stockbrokers and there I go. Well, goddamn psychopaths, they're always pots. Both of the corruption that has led to the downfall of this great economy. Oh God dammit. Bert Kreischer. But yeah, I did. I dodge that bullet. Make a contribution to the world. Bert Kreischer buy American cars. You Buy American cars. I have a Ford out there. That's what I'm fucking talking about. Brian Drugs. Shit, I really would love to go all American. What are you driving today? Um, take out my BMW, but you have a Ford Mustang.

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       That was my phone was my favorite car. It's my most silly card, but my favorite car. But next boss thing I'm going to get is a hard top. The uh, the, the rag top freaks me out. The fact that just fucking media could just hit you in the head.

Speaker 3:          02:34:30       I went on hard type Dif. Odds of that happening are very slim. I just show it also feels like it's about that, you know, I have a,

Speaker 10:         02:34:45       well, it'll lessen the blow. Perhaps

Speaker 3:          02:34:51       cigarette. He's Tom's a girl. Put them on. All right. Oh, took out of my fucking car. Hold on. Why is your car on? Where's my Koran? It's not a stretch ones.

Speaker 1:          02:35:04       Put It on speakerphone. I'm trying. You want me to do it for you?

Speaker 3:          02:35:08       Hey, you're on the Joe Rogan podcast with Joe.

Speaker 10:         02:35:10       Hey Daddy. Tommy Burns. When I talk about that guy Burt crushes, you got a problem with that guy.

Speaker 3:          02:35:27       What did that, where are you at? Where are you at? Do you bypass it ina come say hi

Speaker 10:         02:35:33       it right now. We're live right now.

Speaker 3:          02:35:44       How was the bird? Christ and Tommy. I'm going to tell him about the time I shaved your underarms.

Speaker 10:         02:35:51       All right. I love you Dominique.

Speaker 3:          02:35:55       He, we were in, we were in Hawaii doing a cake is under Tom's hair. Tom. So fucking Harry. His hair connects from his underarms to his chest. And I was like, and I go, I saw, and I go, Tom, you can't let that happen.

Speaker 1:          02:36:06       I'm so glad you brought this up because I want you to tell me what you told me last night. Is that cool? Can you tell me last night what those guys said? Well, the guy said about like the reason why you were happy that Russell Peters wasn't there when you guys were shooting guns.

Speaker 3:          02:36:22       Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tell that story. So let's, I'll start to it for the, so we do me, Tom and Russell Peters do a Gig for the, for the USO, for the military and Pearl Harbor, our Buddy Charlie books. It flies us all down. Russell's brothers' there. Russell's a great guy. Love Roslov Russell and I love his brother even more. If I could tick a one person to death, it would be his brother. His brother Clayton has got the best giggle in the wine. Just get mad. So think about it a little bit. So we get there and Russel now Russel is definitely a big, like he's a big name and he doesn't, he's not gonna he's there to do the show. He's also there for vacation with his check and his brother and his wife and they're having a good time and then when it's all to hang out, but there's like a list of things that they kind of wanted us to do.

Speaker 3:          02:37:07       One of them is like a sample firearms, like go out and shoot firearms and and like do this like thing where these people come up in the, in the screen and you've got to shoot him and Russell don't want to do this shit. So we're like, we're like, all right to me Tom, Charlie and all are wives go out to do this. Like simulation where it's, it's war. We're all have guns. We all have fucking, there's a big thing up and we get out there and we're like, man, I wish I hustled. Come. This is really cool. And Tom's like, yeah, I know. And then the guy comes up and he's like, alright, the simulation started in 30 seconds. If it's brown and it moves, you kill it. And we were like, well thank God Russell didn't come because he would not have enjoyed this case.

Speaker 3:          02:37:44       That impression is amazing. Gimme that impression again. All right, this starts in 30 seconds. If it's Brown and it moves you kill it. God Damn, that sounds like nick melting. It's my old [inaudible] about 10 years ago is still robust. Oh. Oh Man. I have a credit is the craziest shit ever. So just so we joking around about killing brown and then Brian and then Scott, Tom and I just kind of blow it off. We're like, oh, that was fucked up. I'm glad Russell wasn't here for that will Clayton, cause they're both very brown. So, so then we go to do the show and I go at first and I, and it's like, I kind of do okay. Uh, but I'm hosting a little bit. Tom's younger at comedy at the time, so he's going to go second because it's a little easier of a spot. He goes second, he opens with a joke, like, uh, they say don't make fun of Hawaiians.

Speaker 3:          02:38:27       Tom's opening joke was, wow, island living is a really slow down here. They, that's what they told me. I didn't know they were talking about your metabolism's. Wow, these people are fat. Like that's his opening joke, right? Yes. So, uh, so then Russell goes on stage and Tom and I realized for the first time we put the dots together that these people had been trained to kill Brown people and they just have a brown person headlining on stage and they don't see, they're not seeing the nuances of Indian versus Iraqi. They're just seeing brown. And you can hear the murmur in the crowds. It's like, why is this guy here? Why, why don't we have a white guy like you know, in their heads yet. And Tom and I was just like, Ooh. And then what about black guys? Black is very different than brown to, I mean I'm, look, I'm, I'm also with the black guys having, what are they saying?

Speaker 3:          02:39:13       We wish we had a black guy. There weren't a lot of black guys to be honest with you. It was a lot of white guys. Yeah, it was, I mean it was Pearl Harbor. We weren't in like the thick of it. It was a lot of officers. It was the navy like, I mean, and I'm also, I'm also putting words in the mouths of people who aren't allowed to talk right now. So I don't want you to think I'm, I'm from Pearl Harbor. I don't have a problem with Brown people. But I'm telling you, we were, this was the heat of the war and this is what me and Tom Experience. Yeah. Know the truth. And it was, and we were like, fucking, then the next day they were like, yeah, you're never coming back. Well, and Charlie lost that Gig. It was a really cool gig. Hawaii for like a week.

Speaker 3:          02:39:47       But so during this Gig, so, so you would go to Hawaii for a week and do how many shows? He was one show, two shows you used to do two shows, one in like the mess hall for the guys and that could be dirty as you want it to do. And then one in, um, and then one for like that was on stage and like dog, the bounty hunter would come out and like wave to everybody. So did they cancel it because Russell was brown desc I think they, I think they said they canceled it because Tom and I were dirty, but we weren't really dirty. You know, like we were just, we didn't like curse at all. But I think they just, they just canceled it. You can't curse. It was also a new, you couldn't curse at all, but great. But no one cares. No one cares.

Speaker 4:          02:40:26       Could you imagine though, the idea that you are, they can send you to war, they can arm you with guns and tell you you're supposed to kill these people, but you can't hear anybody swear at a comedy show. I mean that was the military. I think that's pretty much like their thing. They don't ever let people curse on their shows. I remember I read a Louis Ck article that he had on his blog about, um, going to, uh, overseas to entertain the troops and about how one time he kind of got dirty at a show and he apologized afterwards, but he's just like, he couldn't help it. They were loving it. They were just going crazy and you know, he couldn't help it. He just wanted to entertain them. He wanted them to be laughing. But yeah, I guess they, uh, they do a lot of censorship, Huh? Keep you from really doing your full act.

Speaker 3:          02:41:11       Right. But the first night there we got, me and Tom get there and there's, Russell is not there. It's just me and Tom and our wives and Tom and I did proceed to get fucking piss drunk and on the beach. And then we go up to his room. I don't know, my wife falls asleep. It's me, Tom and Christina push. I call her in the in his room and Tom has his shirt off and he's and his chest hair connects from his armpits to his tits. So you Tommy, let me shot shape and that shape that for you. I'll shape it. So it looks like you have breasts so you look more muscular and he goes, you think that'll work? I'm like, yeah, we're both really drunk. So I say align, right? I shave, have a line here and I give him a very well defined armpit hair that looks like a fucking mustache. And then it, and then I shave all this and I just give it what it looks like. It looks, yeah, Tom got pictures and it looks like it's tits wearing tits or wearing a mask about to commit a robbery. This looks like fucking two tents. One

Speaker 4:          02:42:02       Ooh, no one knows who we are. I will. Well folks, we need you to harass Thompson girl on Twitter and tell him to put these pictures online. We need to see these pictures. He's got him. He posted on, I think they're on his Facebook to be honest with you. Going to put down in your mom's house. This was a great guy. He's really as well. I love funniest fucking guys. So did you want to talk about that situation you had or know if five five minutes perfect situation had yeah, no,

Speaker 3:          02:42:25       I mean I don't, I'm not, I mean, I don't know what his say. I mean it's, you know, I don't know. It's a weird,

Speaker 4:          02:42:32       you don't have to talk about it. What do you, what would you say? What would I say if I was you? Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker 3:          02:42:38       I, it's a, I don't know if I saw Bieber at a grocery store, I would also get hard on

Speaker 4:          02:42:45       that. Was that about, is that what you're talking about? No, no, no, no. Listen, I don't want to force you in anything, so we'll just end this thing right here. Uh, seriously. Cause we got to end anyway. We got five minutes before the power goes off because this is a three hour podcasts already and that three hours you stream cuts it off and then it becomes two separate Hongson it gets annoying.

Speaker 3:          02:43:02       J Morton, I've been very incestuous. I would say with this Tracy Morgan story, Jay as admittedly on his podcast, said he, her about that had happened to him and he did. He distinctly regrets having ever having told it on opie and Anthony that had happened to him. He started telling it that it happened to me. And at the time that he told her that it happened about me, I didn't. I was like, Oh fuck, that makes me feel like whatever. I, it, it was a story I never wanted told I didn't want to told because I don't know Tracy. I don't, I, I'm telling it's a fucking something I never wanted to, I want it to be behind the scenes. Like when you have a good Mitch Hedberg story, I thought it would be one of those, you know, and uh, and thought it'd be a good story that we tell at comedy clubs and, right.

Speaker 3:          02:43:42       Yeah. Everywhere. Where there's a lot of those a lot I like, yeah, I got a great auto on George Story. There's a, there's a bunch of great stories that we all tell each other. And so Jay started telling us stage and then started telling him that that had happened to him. I talked to him on his podcast about it and he distinctly said, I'm, I'm done telling it. I'm never going to tell it again. I don't want to tell it anymore. It's my wife thought it was a bad idea the first time I told it. And then, and then what happened was we went to Amsterdam and Gary Finkel, Gert, Gary Garfinkel, the VP of, of showtime, said to me in front of a bunch of comics, uh, your Bert from the Tracy Morgan Story, Jay tells on a special and which fucking, it's like throwing a lunch meat in front of lions. Like Dave. Everyone's like, what do you mean, what do you mean? And then I,

Speaker 1:          02:44:27       twofold protective of a friend, I was concerned that he had taped it for a special, and I was like, that's, it's going to make, that's fucking sociopathic. You can't do that.

Speaker 3:          02:44:38       But he, I talked to him today and he said, you know, he did did, he did tape it for a special, but he told it that had happened to me, which I, you know, it's a very, it's still a weird middle ground because I, you know, I,

Speaker 1:          02:44:47       it's still your story. It's still your life still. Your, it's still your story. You told him the reason why it was funny in the first place. Cause you told him he laughed at it and then he repeated what you said. Yeah. And it's your story to the events in, I mean, it's, you know, whether it's, you know, look, every story is not exactly the events in category in, you know, in order, in absolute order. It's, there's an art to telling a story and that's what you're really good at. You're really good at not just telling stories, but telling them what the economy of words and setting them up correctly and, and building it right to a big ending. And that's what you did in that thing. It's not just a story. Okay. Because you didn't tell that story as if, uh, you know, it was, you're connecting the dots. Man Walks on, land man finds plant management. You didn't do that. What you did is you told it in a theatrical way and he just simply repeated that, okay, that's not telling someone's story. That's stealing someone's bit. Yeah. You know it all right Brian?

Speaker 9:          02:45:43       I think so. Absolutely. If I told you a story of something that was really same, I mean it's like that's a real story. That's like I saw I was going to stop doing, I saw somebody get hit on the highway and die. You know, like the brain splattered out. I talked about a long ass time ago on a podcast and it was like one of the biggest, craziest things that's ever happened to me. If I told that story to Joe and then Joe started doing it originally as it happened to him on stage to begin with, immediately that would piss me off. So fucking hard. And then the fact that you've talked to them already, I think that would even make it even a thousand times worse.

Speaker 3:          02:46:16       I think that, I think that in this, in this worst case scenario that I, this is, you know, obviously, but

Speaker 9:          02:46:24       I think he didn't look his best. He did that it the fact that the story is structured in a funny way, you know, you told him a story that's structured in a funny way. It's not simply a bunch of facts just put together in a timeline. You told it to them in a, in an entertaining way.

Speaker 3:          02:46:40       You know, the, the, out of the, all of this that happened, I think the best, best of the worst case scenario is that he did, he does tell it on a special, I mean, I, you know, he does tell him on a special that had happened to me. So in a, in a weird way, I get,

Speaker 9:          02:46:54       yeah, he gets the last for something like, well, yeah, that's mean. It's pretty important. I mean, Jay, yeah. Well it's, I'm fucking, he doesn't want to not do it because it's too good. Yeah. He, uh, yeah. And it's written out how you set it down. It's not like he did not put the words in the story. You do only the only fair thing to do is have Jay on the podcast and let him tell his side of the story. I don't know. I mean or not or act like like like exactly how we acted like that before. We just don't fucking talk to the guys don't have anything to do with that guy. I don't want to be apart of,

Speaker 3:          02:47:27       I don't want to be a part of, of the, of an

Speaker 9:          02:47:30       tack on Jay at all because I never, I mean it's as much as I should have been a fucking grown man. I should been a grown man at the very beginning. If I wasn't comfortable with what was being happened, I should have been a grown man stood up and said, I don't like this. Make it stop right now. That's what I should've done. You're right. And in essence, I, I didn't. And

Speaker 3:          02:47:48       so and so what is happening is exactly you reap what you sow. I, I allowed this behavior, I loud. Whatever is happening to happen. It's, and it's as much my fault as it is anyone's guess. You're in a bad relationship.

Speaker 9:          02:48:02       Yeah. You need a break up. Yeah, I'll, that's what it sounds like. Maybe it's to you. Do you need to make up? Is that what's going on? He kiss you on the belly. Does he make you do things you don't want to? Yeah. What does he do? There's a secret here. You're, you're your who were molested. We're going to turn down the lights and we run out of time. You, Brian Chesky says yes. It, we were at a time. I don't want it just to go over a good, uh, well, we're over on iTunes, but we have about seven minutes on eastern being molested. No, he's over on iTunes. That, that might work better than they used terms. The thing that Tom, Tom and I had a conversation about it last night

Speaker 3:          02:48:46       and I, you know, it, it, uh, it is behavior. If, if, if in fact I should take a responsibility for everything. My Ego was inflamed the first time he told it and he said that it happened to me and my ego was inflamed and I loved it because it made me feel good. It made me feel like I was a real comic, that I had a real fucking thing. And then I thought that was where it would end. I didn't, you know, obviously we said this, I've said this, Morgan feel about this. I don't want fucking defined out because here's the worst part is I never want to trace it up. The reason I ever told it, so I didn't want fucking Tracy to go.

Speaker 6:          02:49:16       Bert Kreischer why'd you tell that story? Why do you mean, why can't you keep that to yourself? Yeah. You know, I have kids. I'm a, you know,

Speaker 3:          02:49:22       that's the fucking worst part of it is. I mean, I think Tracy, I doubt he remembers at night in the slightest, but I don't know how he'd, I don't know how he act. It's hopefully, you know, here's the worst part is I told it, I told the story to a bunch of comics in Cincinnati with Tony Woods. Tony Woods was one of my good friends who used to party all the time. And Tony was there that night. And Tony, and I know when you tell the story so much and then you start going, how much of this is true? Like you just end up getting, hitting the beats of your story and then you're like, yeah, you're like, what? And so I said to Tony, I go, I'm going to tell the story again. I go, man, step in at any point and tell me where I'm straying off from the exact truth.

Speaker 3:          02:50:00       And he was like, okay. Told all whole story verbatim. Antonio at the only point, the correct it is. He thought Tracy said more before. He said, no, that's how you get out of Panacek. He thought that he was like, no, Tracy stood up and he was like, check this yet, and gave a little bit of a monologue, which I just, I just got to the, Oh say set a few more things. Like he stood up and he was like, yeah, yeah. And then, and then as we left, you change that to like somebody else, like Alan Thicke or something. It's your story, Dude. It's your story, you know? And that's disturbing, but it's depressing isn't it? Yeah, it was a great podcast. I'm glad we ended on that.

Speaker 6:          02:50:34       Yeah, I had a great time today, man. It was for him. As much as it's important for you to not let people step on you, for him to not step on people. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:50:42       He, he knows. I think he knows everything that he did wrong in that trans transparent show that you were a little bit weak and I was weak and the and so, so if anyone is at fault, I'm as much of his fault and a little bit, you let him step on you. Yeah, and so it's completely, it is something that if I want to have a productive life as a comic, I fucking pass it. Maybe people hear that story and they go, who the fuck's Bert Kreischer and they researched me on is after a special,

Speaker 6:          02:51:09       I think that's going to do more damage to him, then it's going to benefit him. He's a great storyteller. He's a funny, really funny and he's a great story story like that. It makes him seem illegitimate. It really, I mean he's, he's got, he's better than that. It doesn't need to do that. He does all, his whole act is good. He's a solid comic. He's a very funny guy and it doesn't need to do that one bit. That one bit discredits him in a way that's unfortunate and unnecessary and uh, unfortunately really, truly it's going to define it

Speaker 3:          02:51:36       smart is that big. Killed then is the rest of his material. He does a really fucking bananas.

Speaker 6:          02:51:42       Tracy Morgan repression is dynamite, you know, if you know it's almost excusable just because of the Morgan impression is so fucking good. It was a really fucking good, when you read the chat threads on, on Youtube, it's like he could do that with anybody though. Man. He does a great Colin Quinn and he's a great impressionist. He's one of the best. He is in my opinion, one of the most underappreciated impressionists amongst comedians down his Collin Quinn

Speaker 1:          02:52:06       is on the fucking bun and it's really funny. He has like funny shit that he says,

Speaker 3:          02:52:12       no, no, no, no. I'm never going to fucking man. You can't. You can't not be honest. You got to

Speaker 1:          02:52:19       breast the positives, the negatives, the whole ball of wax. It's not

Speaker 3:          02:52:22       his, and he'd, he would agree. I would, I would venture to say you would probably, if he was sitting at this table agree with everything we're saying to, to a large point, and I think his wife is Nikki is a lot like you in the sense that the first time he told that on opiate, Anthony has it. It happened to him. She was like, you fucked up. You can't do that. You can't say that it happened to you.

Speaker 1:          02:52:42       You don't have to, you don't have to. It's not necessarily, you know, Mark Twain once said, always tell the truth that way you don't have to remember anything and it's a smart fucking thing. It's a smart way to be, you know, people forgive you for the truth. They don't forgive is horse shit because then they the goddammit, it's tough enough communicating with people with noises that you make with your fucking mouth. You know, that we, we, you know, we would, we attached to a bunch of meaning. It's, it's difficult. It's difficult to do. When I find out that you're making artificial noises, you're faking it, that you're saying things that aren't true or you're bullshitting me or you know you're, you're representing yourself in any way where I feel like now I can't get an honest read from you. Now our communication is all horse shit because you just have this, this impression that you want to put out.

Speaker 1:          02:53:27       You don't want me to know the real you want to, you want to put out this impression and you wanted me to respond to it in a positive way to fill up your fucking insecurities. Okay. And that's not what it's supposed to be all about. That's why when you were talking about your machine story and you were saying, could you imagine if that machines do have somebody came up to you and goes, dude, you go everywhere you go. People, y'all at the machine. I mean I have a tee shirt, I have two of them that say the machine, it has your face on it. Could you imagine if that wasn't a real story

Speaker 3:          02:53:52       owed it would having a somebody else, oh, it would fucking crush. Crush me. If someone found out that that was a fun, that it was entirely fabricated, I would fucking, no one would ever listen to a word. That's the only reason. The only reason I, I ever was hesitant about ever telling the Tracy Morgan story in the first place because all it took was Tracy Morgan, one tine salmon that never happened. And my entire credentials as a comic for the rest of my life were done with no matter if me and Tony Woods stood on a soapbox and Washington square park, like Charlie said, I just agree and I think everybody would believe you. Oh yeah, maybe. Maybe. I don't know. You know how people view Tracy Morgan? Let's [inaudible] I remember, I remember when I was young comic in New York saying I had a story that was this.

Speaker 3:          02:54:35       It was, it was based off of a bit that I had heard in the music and I liked the way they tag the song. And I just wrote this bit with this story involved and the tag was the song from an outcast lyric and it was great. It was fucking great. And this fucking guy came up to me and he goes, that is one of the best stories I've ever heard. It has it. It has ego, it has everything that's beautiful about a story. You've got to tell me is it true? And I looked at him and I wanted credit and I went, no, I fucking made it up and if you at me, like I told him

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       I fucked Santa Claus, Santa Claus in the ass, and I was like, I was like, number one, I will never fucking make up. I will never make up like a fucking fabricated. That is you just, it just, you just don't have anything to fucking put your head on the end that you put your head in the pillow and the end of the night and you go, all I got or whatever happened to me, however I fucking tell it however I craft it and present it. Unless you tell a story that you wrote and made up and then go, I just made that up. That didn't really happen. Oh yeah, I've done that before. Plenty of times. Yeah. They're not doing something for common book comic relief. As long as you're not trying to mislead people. Yeah, as long as you're only doing it for your intention is to fucking entertain. That's what my job is. I'm a fucking comedian. It's a fucking comedian. He's a good one. God Damn. And follow him on Twitter.
