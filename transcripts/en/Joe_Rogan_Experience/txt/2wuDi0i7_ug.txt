Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. Well, I think there's a beautiful thing about being influenced by movies and books and songs in that they provide us with entertainment and inspiration, but they also really distort the shit out of realistic scenarios. But I think you're supposed to be able to distinguish between that though. You know, art is one thing in reality as another art. I just, I think it's based on reality and then we've got a couple wins is reality so much. Yeah. Yeah. Especially with women. How many women have these discs, but especially young women that have these distorted perceptions of Channing Tatum movies. Channing Tatum is, that's how men behave and this is reality. It's going to happen to me. I just gotta find my prints. Yeah. It's just not a bunch of you want to come in you, that's all it really is out there. They're just lying. And both sides. The, the aggressive male side and the men who pretending they're not like all the other men cause they want to come. And you too. And that's the only way they can go about getting in there as being unique. Yeah. Or, or just being like on your side, men are shit, right, right. I'm hot. I'm horrified to be a man. Your Shit, you see that on, on Twitter and it's most archaic form, which is the White Knight. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:15          I fucking love the White Knight. I don't think I really verbally go, oh yeah, reading anything else but white knights on Twitter. When you bash somebody who's a girl, uh, and, and, and you know, you call her out on something. Uh, and then some guys swoops in, don't take that. You are beautiful. You're a beautiful person and this, and he just like, dude, first of all, you just want to fuck her. You want to do the same thing. The guy that's fucking bashing or but wants to do. He's just taking a different angle, you know, and you swoop in and what is their mindset? Oh, DM me, you're a good man. Does it stop it? They just want love, love. Love is not going to get their way. They just want love. It just doesn't have it. I've given up on the concept of love. I honestly don't think it really exists.

Speaker 2:          02:09          And this is something a lot of people have called me on. I think love is a cross between um, lust and an obsession. Kind of a, not really obsession. I think maybe um, a, a fascination kind of just this quick thing that happens. It doesn't last long. It could last maybe a couple, a few years, quite a few years, but it's still the same thing. It's lust and this fascination with the person and that conjures up this mixture that seems like something that's love. In the perfect scenario. You don't think that people can be in love? No. I honestly don't see two people. I think honest love would be like, you just never argue. You agree with everything. There's never a snooty snippy moment, so it just doesn't exist. And in time it, it transmit, it transfers into something more, a habit, a habitual thing. The, the lust turns into habit and the fascination turns into comfort zone.

Speaker 2:          03:19          And then you're just together and you continue to be together and you don't even know about love anymore. You're not coming home every day. You're not at the office going, fuck, I want to be with her. God, when you first get together, you're like, I can't even work. I love this girl. I want to be with her. I want fucking smeller Herrick, kiss her and hug her, and then you've got to leave and you go into the store for 10 minutes, Sweetie. Oh, I love you on one wall. I wish I didn't have to go. Come with me. Come to the store. It's just fucking crazy. 20 years of marriage and you're still doing that bullshit and you still love the person. No, you're now a habitual in a habitual relationship.

Speaker 1:          04:02          I thought the sleep believed that he is fucking pissed all over every place. There's a bunch of people at work right now listen to is going to fall in love. Well, you definitely don't get the newness, but you could still have a great relationship. But what is that? It's not love, but the falling in love park, the falling of the newness. Well, we know what the newness is. The newness is a hormonal rush to make babies and you're supposed to fuck the time. Yes. Yeah. That's why relationships, most relationships. Peter out around three months in, that's when the woman hits her first trimester. She's already supposed to be pregnant and you're supposed to be out of there. Right. Bang in a new one. Why? Because people were getting eaten by Jaguars on a daily basis. You had to fuck as many people as you possibly could in order to ensure that this the species survived.

Speaker 1:          04:49          Yeah. The problem is our high mortality rate when they then when human beings were in their infancy are high mortality rate led to very specific types of behaviors that are ingrained in our genetics and those specific types of behaviors are frowned upon by feminists now. They the the the very thing that got us to 2014 they trying to curve back. Yeah. This is like deceptive behavior in order to try to get laid, you know, any type of sex other than the sex that they feel comfortable with. I'm happy that this happened. If, if, if the man's have you had fucked her I left leg. Right. You know, it's anything that's not along the lines of their, their, their ideal is, is a rape. Yeah. Yeah. And, and like you said, it's just biological for the preservation of humanity early on. [inaudible] that's how we needed to add. Here's where it gets more fascinating. The women who are trying to tighten this down as much as possible. No one wants a fuck. Yeah. Yeah. At the very top of the fucking machine, the very top of the machine is run by troll ladies.

Speaker 2:          06:00          Sure. All ladies did. Y'all ladies, they're not like really sexy, attractive objects of desire. Yeah. You know, I think when, when they speak about like how like how can a man dictate what happens to our bodies kind of a thing. It's the same thing as how can you dictate what happens to a pretty girl? Yeah. Like you're not a pretty girl so you don't understand what it's like to be that and to be able to manipulate men in such a fashion so you, she should probably, the troll ladies should probably steer clear of what they think attractive men and women should do. It's really funny though to watch. And I'm a lonely cat guy in my house, Joe. Right. That's what it's come to. A lonely cat guy. You know, I occasionally have some bitches over though. You know, you gotta I tell, I mean, like I said with, with this whole, uh, I don't believe in love thing.

Speaker 2:          06:53          I've had to convey to two girls that do come over the house, um, that I am not a boyfriend. I'm not your boyfriend or anything and it's so hard. It's a hard thing. You tell them. So you are not your boyfriend. I went through so many years, Joe, of being with girls much too long, much longer than I should have. Um, a couple of weeks. Yeah. Yeah, no, I was one of those fucking years guys. Like I've stayed in the marriage that I hated for nine fucking years, nine years. And I think radio was part of it because I had gotten into radio halfway through the marriage. So the second half, I didn't even pay attention to it. It was all about fucking radio. I mean radio the straight, I'm, I'm going to build this in a concentrate on that. So whatever burden she was was outweighed by the pleasure of doing radio.

Speaker 2:          07:42          Uh, but after nine years, that was, that was it. So, but I jumped right from that into another relationship that just lasted years. And then after that, when I started thinking like maybe I shouldn't be tell these girls like that, I feel for them so much, you know, and now I just say, look, understand what this is. We are not boyfriend and girlfriend. I am not in a relationship with you and, and it, it, it almost works. I have done, I have to fine tune it. I'm almost there though. So they don't get the message and it's um, I start getting thing. But then when I stuck getting texts, I'd be like, these are girlfriend texts. We're not in a relationship. Yes, I go, this is a girlfriend text. Like what's an example of a girlfriend? A girlfriend tax. Uh, you said I could do this.

Speaker 2:          08:35          And then at the last minute you told me that I can't do it with you. I can't go here or do this or something. I'm like, I changed my mind or I have something else where I made other plans. It happens. It fell through. Oh, well you're treating me like shit. This is, hey, no, that's a girlfriend that isn't a friend. If I call my friend Joe Curry, let's say, and I say, Joe, this weekend I'm having a party at the house, come on over. It'd be like, okay, and then on Friday afternoon I call them and say, Joe, no party. It's just not happening. I'm doing something else. All right, cool. That's like that. Only if I could fuck Joe Curry. See the girls and you're trying to make that you're trying to, I'm trying to make it so they understand that, that they are one of my friends that are girls that if we want to have sex and stuff, that's great.

Speaker 2:          09:30          It's cool and everything, but we can't have this relationship where you live here and where where we are obligated to go out for certain occasions because your mic top bitch or something or whatever it is. What about them fucking other guys? Yeah. That doesn't happen. No, no, no. What were you an asshole? Who's this guy? No, they, they, they could, I don't want to hear about it. Just like, I don't want to have to tell them about it. Oh, I, I've heard this one like, oh, who are you going out with tonight? This is none of your business. It's none of your fucking business. Oh, is it this girl? Is it that one? Oh, up. I'm not telling you. Why would I tell you? Why wouldn't you? Ah, God, I don't want to hear this. I just don't want to hear it. But that's, you know, there's certain patterns of relations in relationships to, people automatically fall into and they think they're allowed to.

Speaker 2:          10:20          Yes. These are, these are allowed because it's become commonplace and that's what they've been used to their whole life. And that's what this, this a groove that the guys have fallen into over the years where they know like, oh my God, you just realize at one point you go, oh, I'm in a relationship. I didn't even want to be in one when we were dating or something or just hanging out, like why does it always have to turn into a relationship? And I've said to girls before, I've said, relationships are the, the, the, the death knell for a good companionship. All of a sudden now there's obligations, responsibilities, accountabilities, all these things that come along with a relationship, take away from the good parts of hanging out, which is we're watching TV, we're drinking, we're fucking, we're going out to dinner. We're not arguing about anything because does that my phone?

Speaker 2:          11:15          Oh, I hope not. Man. How did you manage to avoid, it's your girlfriend. Like you avoided a, you avoided children. You got no children. Yes. That's a big one. That is the biggest because I almost had a kid with my wife, which would have just been, I'd have had to kill myself. I think I would still have to do something to get out of it. Um, Eh, Eh, yeah. Yeah. She went, she got first, she got one of those ectopic pregnancies, which happens in the Fallopian tube and blows up and she like started bleeding internally and a boy, if I had a future me came back at the moment I was driving into the hospital, I may have made a stop at Mcdonald's or you know, I might've had to pick a few things up while she was in the passenger seat bleeding to death.

Speaker 2:          12:07          Oh my goodness. Oh, well you say this because she, she basically, I mean, how much money you should take over the years. It was a bad divorce. It's seven figures she took and her long period of time too, right? Yeah. She got Dominic Barbara for her lawyer, you know, famed bloated and Howard stern attorney. But Dominic Barbara was her lawyer and he was just so much fucking anger that I had. You think I'm angry now people. Wow. Oh, was I angry? Um, and yeah, I, I hated them. I hated that whole camp. The lawyers, they'd come in and I, I had to pay her legal bills, which is another one of those great fucking amazing feminist things. I had to pay your legal bills and mine. So she hires Dominic Barbara and he's just this fucking way expensive attorney. And I think, well, I got to save some money, so let me hire a cheaper attorney.

Speaker 2:          13:00          Oh, that doesn't work, Joe. That's ridiculous. The guy that would come in with like a Manila folder into court and they were, they had hand trucks of, of those big boxes, uh, of legal briefs and stuff on their side. And I'm just, it's just like, oh, this is the worst thing ever. And uh, we, yeah, over the course of quite a few years I had to keep paying her and paying her and then it was over and I'm very happy with that. Do you ever communicate with her now? No. Thank God. And I don't have to. And if I had kids I would have to, I don't understand how that happens. I like a lot of people say, well, no, you know, over the years we've built up a nice relationship. I'm, I'm friends with my ex wife was like, no, you're not. You had to develop something or you would have killed her or yourself or everyone involved.

Speaker 2:          13:49          You have a kid, so you have to kind of build some type of relationship with her. I have a buddy who's friends with his ex girlfriend and his ex girlfriend is now married to another one of his friends and they have kids together and they get all their kids together and play. That's weird. That's just odd. I don't think it ever goes away. I don't think that you fucked her. Ever goes away. No, probably not. Probably not. The uh, the ex boyfriend and the new husband, they do have a little weird thing with each other with the new husband will occasionally criticized the ex boyfriend and a little bit of an over excessive way. Wow. Cause he knows that I'm going to keep this thing going on in the Dick pretends to be cool with it. But we know there's a lot of weirdness to it all weirdness.

Speaker 2:          14:40          Oh, but you got note hand. Oh, that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Dominic, Barbara, the lawyer for my wife, uh, he came to my house a couple of months ago. For what knocked on the door, came to the house because he heard that I got fired from Sirius Xm and he was like, I just got out of rehab, drugs and alcohol ruined my life. I don't longer have a law practice. I'm, you know, I, he got arrested for stealing from one of the stores of the Miracle Mile there and a lot on long island. And, um, and he's just, he's destitute now. He was living on his friend's couch. He went from that attorney that was always on Howard's show and made millions of dollars, obviously made some off of me. Uh, and then he's just destitute now. So I read the stories in the paper before I got fired and everything and ended.

Speaker 2:          15:29          I'll always laughed. I thought, good, good for him, Karma motherfucker. Um, but, and if you, if you crow about Karma, isn't that bad? Karmically, thanks. I think it is too. So, Eh, whatever. Um, but, uh, he, he, he knocked on my door and I'm looking out the window. I like, I think that's fucking Dominic Barbara. And he comes in and he was trying to preach to me, like he's saying, uh, uh, I read what happened and I'm thinking maybe you know, you need help or something, or he wants to be your sponsor. Fuck what I'm talking about. Probably a sees you as an opportunity to get back into the limelight. And B feels bad that he's still your fucking money maybe. And he might've been doing one of those, uh, 12 step things where he's got to make some kind of reconcile affiliation with me.

Speaker 2:          16:16          Uh, so he came over, he did that, but then at the end he sees like, so you got the new show, you're going to be starting up. I'm like, yeah. He goes, you know, I, uh, no, this advertising thing where this, and then he's pitching some type of advertising for the show. So yeah. So he, uh, he left his number let, and then people are stole money from me fucking out of here. And people were saying that. They're like, why did you even let them in your house? Why? You know, and they're saying you should have shot him when he got in the house and say that he just tried to attack you. He's crazy. He was on drugs. He stole money. He's look at his fucking record man. And, and check this knife out here. Yes it matches my cutlery set, but it's not very well very popular item.

Speaker 2:          17:02          That was always the, the intense fear of the thought that reincarnation might be true and even though no one really remembers who they were in a previous life or who they are going to be in the next or something, you always like, I don't want a man. I got a good one this time around. I got so fucking lucky. New York United States wide scale job. This fucking is, I aced this and then you get reincarnated. You're like fucking, you got Ebola, you're coughing your blood up in front of a fucking guy. Fucking a goat or you're a monkey or, and you know, you used to be a person but you can't talk and that's all you're getting bummed out. That would be a bummer. Beaten off, bummed out, knowing you have

Speaker 1:          17:50          to be 10 I was fucking, I was in New York. I was, it was a white guy. I was a white guy who had this whole thing where I was telling chicks, no girlfriend, girlfriends. It was crazy and they still came over. It's crazy. How many of you may think come over because they think I'm going to fix him. This guy with his no girl shit. I think so. I think there have been a few that think like, oh well he just hasn't found the right girl and they had, they'll say they go with it in the beginning, but then they start getting angry with you. Yeah. Is it as they realize, oh this mother fucker's serious sin. Oh wait a minute. He meant that bullshit. You guys say yes, but they can't pull it off. No one really means that when they say it, fuck. Do you think you are that you could pull this off. They get that. Oh yeah. Fuck. Do you think you are? But do you think you are who the WHO. It's a fuck you. You fucking idiot. Exactly why they already fucked you. Ah, rape. Wait a minute, take a I take it back then away. Consent that they can draw a troll. Women have spoken the fucking cliff for the horn. We found another one. Uh, you having fun? What do you live in your life by your own rules? I said, it's fuck you if they don't. People don't like that. I guess.
