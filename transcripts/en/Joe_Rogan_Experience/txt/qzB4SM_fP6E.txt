Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches. What did you, what is the big thing that you got out of this personally? Or sort of intellectual above? I mean, intellectually as personally, right? Personally, you know, there was, I'd been through sort of lifetime of, I dunno, like I was a late bloomer as a kid. I'm real small, always sort of the front of my school came into my, my throat, an average sized guy now, but I came to my growth really late and so I sort of have a basic, you know, schoolboy story about getting pushed around and bullied and, and it's, there's no heroism in that story that always backed down. I always ran for it. I always found some way out of it. And it wasn't because I was a pacifist. It wasn't like had some noble high minded reasons for avoiding the violence. It was that I was scared and I knew I was gonna get my ass kicked.

Speaker 1:          00:50          But I've always kind of felt like that's no excuse for not for fighting, you know, that there's a huge, you should stand up to the bully. Um, I've always felt that way and even though I never did it so, so, so part of what I wanted to do was I wanted to go into that cage and I wanted to sort of stand up to guys who were stronger than me and more skilled than me and sort of taken those beatings that I felt like I should have taken 20 years ago. You know what I mean? Um, and so as deep. Well, yeah, you know, I don't know if you've ever had experience like that as a boy. Um, where were you? Were you behaved in a fashion that you define as cowardly? Yes, definitely. And it's amazing to me. I'm 42 years old now. I've had a lot of accomplishments in my life, have a beautiful wife, I have little children who are wonderful.

Speaker 1:          01:33          It's amazing to me how much psychological weight that still carries from me that I could still meet myself, blush, uh, thinking back to those moments. And so part of it was a redemption story for me about whether I could, whether I could do something to redeem myself, at least in my own eyes for those times when I'd flinched a as a kid. That's awesome. I love that. I love that you did that. I don't love that. You're still blushing over it. Silly social a little bit. It's so crazy. But it just means you've got work to do. That's all it is. You know, just kind of worked before you realize you're not that guy anymore. Right. You know. So when you're doing these heavy, heavy lifting, it dead ends, that impulse, it slows it down. And uh, not, not to mention you're neglecting the forefoot.

Speaker 1:          02:16          All these exercises are pretty much done on the ball on the hill. I was squatting. I remember as you're, you're taught to press through that heel deadlifting the same thing. So your, your, your training over and over these movements that are not practical for a sports movement, which pretty much every sport is played on the forefoot. Yeah, that's true. Like he never really in a sport. You very rarely push off the back of the foot, so kind of moving forward when you're punching the back heels off the ground. Absolutely. And so knowing that it's kind of like, why are we doing this? You know, like w, W, W, W, it's improper training. I mean it really makes sense. Mark has been preaching this for years and you know, and people of Scoff at it and you see now I got to get my heavy back squat and that's fine, but maybe this can help you with it.

Speaker 1:          03:05          You know, start training the feet, looking at looking at what we're talking about here and the sequence of muscles that you're going to start firing when you do start training the feed, like how is this a better option for squatting would be a front squat. And now let's say you take a couple of 45 pound plates and you put them under the balls of your feet. So now you're engaging more of a sports movie and you're on the balls of your feet and you're loading up the front instead of the back, which is the back squat is technically a lower back exercise. It really hits the lumbar and his lower back a lot. Uh, the front squat is going to hit more quadricep muscles required for jumping, you know what I mean, as well as the core and stabilizing the spine with the abdominals and everything.

Speaker 1:          03:46          So that's just a thought like maybe you can do that. You think, start thinking in that process where you're training from the feet up the forefoot up, not just the heels of the forefoot up and you'll start connecting different muscles require for sports movements. Okay. Let's see. Not a hero and other stuff with Alex. this is Kevin. Kevin Right now can crank up the volume, bro. Bro Is Kevin. I'm sorry. I don't know. This. Kevin Pereira was the host of attack of the show for network and the objective is asking. He's a very bright man, didn't as beautiful complexion and excellent bone structure. Look at that job line.
