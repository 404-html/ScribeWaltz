Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Record. Hi sweeties. The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight. If you go to Joe Rogan.net and click on the link for. Is that me? Click on the link for the flashlight and enter in the code name, Rogan. He's a flashlight, flashlight, flesh, flesh. How dare you did? I said, well, I didn't need a flashlight. I don't know. I think I said flesh. I'm a little too few people out there. I'm a little too high to be doing this commercial. Maybe I'm too high and I heard it. Flashlight. Look, the fleshlight is an excellent product. This is for real. I'm going to stray off the script. You know, let's get everybody needs masturbation. That shit's important is important. It seems ridiculous. It's very embarrassing, but it is sexual maintenance and it's important and you shoot way bigger loads, in my opinion with the flashlight, that it's powerful.

Speaker 1:          00:00:58       How? Because your girlfriend gets mad at it. Exactly. Yeah. Now I've lost at least more than one flashlight just vanish. It got thrown away, thrown away. Oh my goodness. Fascinating. Is that no pleasure? Only me. Only me. Can. Pleasure. Not even like a fake part of a person. I think I pattern, but I think it's more that she's embarrassed that I've got a can with an asshole poking at it. Listen, this is the beginning of the show. Hit the button pitches. Duncan trussell's here. We've already had a podcast and a half before we even got started and we might be too high to talk in public. Just give it a fucking country.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       No,

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       the country Tryezz, but God damn. I wish I had it in me. I wish I had some country work ethic, con stance or something. You know, country workout. Fuck you. People talk about a guy that's got a country work ethic automatically. You'll you, you know, you mean a man. Want to admire them? Yeah. Awesome dude. He could just shut his fucking mouth and for some hay around. That's right. There's something about that. That's admirable, right? Isn't it? Sure. It's amazing. It's like some wild west type movie shit. Yeah. That seems like a great life guy who gets up early in the morning, just fucking milks cows till he can't walk anymore and the day goes to sleep. Something admirable about. Have you ever found an attorney, Joe? Yes. I think I have on fear factor. Pretty sure a goat one. Squeeze it. I don't know if I did it. I might be imagining this was so long ago. Um, we had people suck on goat tits. They had actually suck on it. It was very phallic. It was really weird to watch like girls sucking on this tit like sucking milk off. This looks like a black deck. It looks like a deformed,

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       like a short fat black Dick and these girls and these girls were suck at all of these things. Pulling milk out of guys were to, you know, it was, it was. Wow. That goat is experiencing what is essentially a ufo abduction. It's mind cannot process what's happening. Whereas they're used to getting milked apparently because they milk them every day. You know, they squeeze on them. Yeah. But if you imagine having just like fading on you and you don't know what they're doing. So demonic, right? Yeah. Trapped in a cage, right. Attached by color. I think there were attached by a chain trying to make sense on. I mean they must in some way be trying to process what's happening. Oh, and you know what? They were elevated as well. How weird was that? They were up on the platform so that people could get out of them with their mouth. They didn't have to go under him. If I'm pretty sure, if I remember that correctly, I might be imagining that as well, but I remember. Imagine I remember being there thinking how bizarre it was. Just people are sucking on these animal parts on TV, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:04:08       It feels real. If you ever feel cow one. I just wonder if there's a lot of farmers, but it feels real like it feels like you're holding something. That's the only thing that you've ever felt like that before is your Dick. So it feels like it just feels like a. it's like a flashlight for men.

Speaker 3:          00:04:23       When you mean a delta. Yeah. This fucking strains that we drink the milk out of other animals. So we make them make milk and then we drank it and we sell it and it's super common milk. Totally normal. Yeah. It's like we're parasites or cow parasite. We extract some, some they're fluid and we sell it and we add weird shit till we put chocolate in it, but apparently a lot of people believe that eating dairy is not healthy for the human body and that you'll feel better. Your energy levels will be better if you just cut dairy out of your life. I've heard that from so many people. There's no way it can't be true, but milk is delicious and so as ice cream and you can go fuck yourself. I liked cheese, you know, I'm not cutting dairy out. I just went to a.

Speaker 3:          00:05:11       I just went to Paris and she got super stoned. And how'd you get stoned in Paris? I'll talk about it after the podcast. You don't want to mention on the podcast? No. Good move. Good move. Yeah, just a friend out in Paris. Wow. That's lucky break. But uh, but weed is illegal and parents, how illegal is it? I don't know. I was standing next to someone openly smoking hash in the subway. So really? Yeah. So I don't know how illegal. I don't think anyone. I don't know. I have no idea, but I hadn't eaten there yet and I was super stoned and it was the first time I'd ever eaten like French cheese and I almost passed out because it tasted so good. I swear to God I got a momentary vertigo or it's like I've been eating prison cafeteria food for my entire life because the food over there is better. Food in Paris is better. It comes straight from the countryside right now though.

Speaker 5:          00:06:06       Hundreds and thousands of dudes tweeting for all over the country going, why don't you fucking move?

Speaker 3:          00:06:12       I would if I could really. I've always thought they had the worst food until he. He said this because I always. I worked at a French restaurant once and it was the worst food ever. Like the lobster bisque or something like that was the only thing that I thought was decent on the whole menu.

Speaker 5:          00:06:25       What is it like a low end restaurant or was it a nice place? French place? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'm not really familiar. I'm not as much as much of a food efficient auto that I could tell you what French food really is. I know there's a place down the street from here I really liked. That's supposedly French because they have fog law. That's the French way of saying, right, this duck liver, it's delicious. It's one of the rude as fuck they. They were the mouth. Fuck this. Poor goose. It's terrible. I mean their mouth. Fuck this goose and force feed them. It's kind of crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:06:56       It's a. it's a horrible, horrible thing. What is it? Their liver? No, it's their liver mixed in with the shit base spray into them and it like flavors. That's what it is, right? It flavors the liver so that it tastes really good, but it's so good. Here's the weird thing. That's the guy. I think this is going to piss everybody off if they're not already mad about me saying French fruit's better, but it is better.

Speaker 5:          00:07:19       Like it's defined better. Like what? What makes it better?

Speaker 3:          00:07:25       They just use more butters that it's more like I don't give no, but I mean in France, I've got to imagine it's it just on another level of like it's more, it's more intense. It's like. I'm trying to think of a great way to explain it. It's like the volume is turned up a little bit more on it. It's flavor wise. The flavor's better. It's just, it's like they like the way they cook it. The place that we went to, they were cooking. We ordered this rib platter for two and they cook this giant slab of meat on an open fire, like above a fireplace and you can watch it in the restaurant and the restaurant feels like something out of the 16 hundreds or something. Do you know why it feels like that? Because it's been around since the 16 hundreds. Like everything. There's old, old, old, old, so it's like you're in this place where so many human lives have happened and I'm not saying that's why the food tastes better, but it's your insurance. It's so good, man. It was really good.

Speaker 5:          00:08:22       Or kind of make a word one. One thing that I never appreciated, I think before watch sort of watching that no reservations show was that that food for the preparation of food is really an art form. It really, truly is an art form. I mean I kind of knew that abstractly and I always like appreciated good chefs, but until I watched that show not, you see that guy's passion, how he describes food, how um, how uh, how addictive it is. You know, what's the word I'm looking for? Not Addictive. It's like, it's, it's, it's,

Speaker 6:          00:08:56       it just gets you hungry like it, it starts like the way he describes things, like I never get more hungry than when I'm watching that shit. It's like you realize that people are really bad ass chefs. All these guys, they're all like, they all have ideas and thoughts and like a, a method to how they prepare things and, and it's, it's so fascinating that it's just to maximize the impact that it has on the pallet and it's just strange art form the art form of flavor. And I never really appreciated that until I watched that show. And then when then you what you see like a really well prepared dish and you're like, wow, that guy just fucked me up with some crazy crab with squid ink pasta. And you realize that like these creations of textures and combinations of flavors, it really is a bad ass art form. I never appreciated it before.

Speaker 3:          00:09:47       Yeah, yeah. And you get this when you taste something really good like that, you get a glimpse at how there's like this spectrum of sense gratification and some people in some parts of the world and figured out ways to hit the higher ends up. So if you're only experiencing life at this one spectrum of it, then when you do get something super high end like that, it's really intense. It's just uh, it's amazing to think people eat like that every day. And also the weird thing about a lot of people in Paris, they fucking eat so much and they eat all day long. It seems like everything there is about eating or going out to eat with your friends. And it's this very serious ritual. Like when you go to a restaurant, it has the same energy of like you feel like you're in an air traffic control tower.

Speaker 3:          00:10:34       People are eating in the serious way. It's like a, like they're taking in an art or listening to a symphony and some of these restaurants, not all of them, but some of them it's intense and there's like four waiters, they're dressed like super formally. There's kids being trained since they were like 15 to be waiters and so it's this cultural, it's embedded into their culture and they've really refined it and it's really fucking cool, but French people that are the ones that you don't see fat people there, they're eating all the fucking time, but most of them are thin. Most of them seem like they're in shape. It's really weird. How do they do that? People say because there's no preservatives in the food they eat, like food that comes straight from the countryside. That's what people say. I mean, I'd heard all this stuff by the way I'd heard it before I went.

Speaker 3:          00:11:19       I read it. The food, there's better. People are like thin people are living life and I was extremely skeptical, link, whatever. It's that Buddhist quote, I think I've said it on here. Some people will tell you this place is better than that place. This country is better than this country. There's smarter people here than there, but I say to you, the whole world is on fire. Everywhere you go. People are consumed with the same fears and worries and it's all the same. The Buddha did not eat ribs and fucking Paris because that place is different. It's fucking nice man. For subway signs. They all look like the lettering, the font. They use an absence bottles like, yeah, it's fucking trippy and cool. And I'll, I'll shut up about Paris because I might sound like an Asshole, but we, uh, you know about the catacombs of Paris.

Speaker 4:          00:12:10       No, you were describing this to me. This is the most scariest Shit I've ever seen in my life that did it. I did not know existed. And there's more than one. I've soft photos once of a church, but just explain to everybody what it is.

Speaker 3:          00:12:21       So underneath Paris basically, and I don't know the exact history behind this, but what happened is I think because of the black plague, everyone starts dying. They're having these mass die offs and they were. They ran out of room and the cemeteries. So they had to dig up all the bones from the cemetery surrounding Paris and they took them under Paris into these limestone quarries and created these things called Ossuarys, which are these open air crips and someone has gone and basically. So to get there, you go down these winding steps that go down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down and down to a point where you start feeling like you're going crazy because you just keep seeing more steps and more steps and more steps and more steps in your mind. Starts saying you are going deep, deep underground.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       Like we're talking like out of breath on the stairmaster steps like way down to the quarries under the city and you sort of walk around and then suddenly you come out and do hallways of bones. Just yellowed old French bonds that someone is stacked into a patterns like crucifixes and it looks like the Texas chainsaw massacre house when you went in the movie where they have bone sculptures everywhere. It's like that. They've just. Someone just took like a shitload of femurs and it's like, I think I could make a crucifix out of this and like. So there's a cross in the middle. There's stacks of skulls. They say there's 9 million skeletons down there, 9 million. So 9 million lives are completely anonymous now. No one knows who the fuck they are. All you see is just, there's no names, there's not a wall listing who's down there.

Speaker 3:          00:14:12       It's just row upon row upon row of skulls and skulls and I swear to God, it's got to be the worst job on the planet. I pass this French kid whose job is to sit in a lawn chair down there and observed people to make sure they don't steal bones. And I walked by the kid and he was like hail and sick because it's damp down there and it kinda sounded like he was talking to himself and French. He kind of seemed out of his mind. He just sits in bones all day. Best place to rape ever though, right? If you're going to rape and murder somebody, take them down there. That'd be perfect. Well, it gets weirder, so as it turns out under Paris, the catacombs at the are in. That's only a fraction of the catacombs. There is miles and miles and miles of wining catacombs. One of our waiters told us that people go down there and they get lost and they find them down there and they've starved to death in the and catacombs fucking die.

Speaker 3:          00:15:09       Crazy. Last. You go down there and the dark, the flashlight runs out. No one's coming down there and you're fucking so much. Gets even weirder. These fucking French police. It's on the Internet and I'm just freaking out and thinking about dying that way. Could you imagine your fucking slash light goes out and it's so far down like it's like a basement of earth that just that last moment and then nothing. Blackness. You start, you would start hearing, start hearing things, start seeing things. You probably don't send people down there looking for folks. No, not some. Not some French mime who got depressed and decided he was going to go down and take a break in the category. So is it open to anyone yet that the Parisian teenagers have their own entrances and they bring turntables and speakers down there and have dance parties?

Speaker 6:          00:16:06       Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:16:08       So fucking cool. We want to go down there and take Iowasca with you, Joe. So we're not going to say, could you imagine what a terrific combination that would you adopt, right? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:16:19       Well you would definitely never be seen again, right? You would probably just be absorbed with the energy of what it must have been like to see millions of people just right in front of you by some incurable disease that was inescapable and you had just had a hope that some of the genetics would carry on it. Some people would be able to live through this shit.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       If you ever get serious about your life, that is a. A cure is the c nine millions goals to Emr.

Speaker 6:          00:16:46       Come on, man. Does it really make you less serious about your life? It just, you know, it just lets you know. Yeah, it lets you know that there's, we're, we're very fortunate that shit's going this way. We're very fortunate. We were born in 2000. We're alive in 2011. We're very fortunate. You know, just a little while ago, stuff was terrible. You know, I joke around about being on stage, like when we were in Philly and I was going, do you know why the streets are so narrow around here? Because there were made by people writing fucking horses. Like wrap your head around that. This city was designed by people who thought, well, we just need a place to put the horses. This is where the horses are going to run. Like everybody got around it. I'll fucking city on horses.

Speaker 3:          00:17:28       Well there's that. You know, there, there's this thing I just read about this, a famous, I think he was an obstetrician and he died in a mental asylum. It was unready. He died in a mental asylum. This is way back. I don't know the exact time, but it was when they still believed in the humors of the body, their idea of the way the body worked was based on, you know, bloodletting and they didn't know they thought

Speaker 7:          00:17:49       they were. They didn't know that flies came from fly eggs. They thought there was something called spontaneous generation where if you had the right elements in one place, it would produce a fly. He, they didn't know there were eggs. So they had these really fascinating ways of understanding the universe. What year was this? I don't know the exact year. If you look up spontaneous generation, it'll pop up the year that they believed this. But, um, there was a obstetrician who suddenly came up with this crazy idea. He thought that if doctors wash their hands between handling, like doing an autopsy or handling a dead body and delivering a baby, then maybe the mothers wouldn't die as much as they were dying of this infection called fluorosis. So he's like, we should start maybe washing her hands guys, after you handle the a rotting corpse and then put your hand in that lady's Pussy.

Speaker 7:          00:18:45       Why don't you wash your hands and um, doctors were like, you're a fucking lunatic. You think washing, you think if we wash our hands after we handle a corpse and touch a woman's open, open dilated pussy that it's going to keep her from getting the infections they've been getting. A gentleman's hands are always clean. That's what the doctor said. No joke. So this guy, I tried all these experiments and he like, he dropped the death rate and one of these like wards where women are giving birth to one percent where it was 30 percent and other places and he kept talking. You've got to wash your hands. You wash it with this kind of chemical mix and the people won't die. You should wash your hands, germs are getting into people. But they didn't. I don't think they knew what germs were. Anyway, the guy died,

Speaker 6:          00:19:30       I think it was. We didn't think it was germs. Just poison

Speaker 7:          00:19:33       with evil, which was. I don't know the explanation, but it's really interesting because you could, it's kind of logical. You could see why they would think that, but they couldn't accept the idea that there was microscopic things floating around, like even though I guess you could see them in a microscope for some reason, they really wanted to deny this in the same way. Now when you talk about the idea that there might be an extra dimensional aliens, there are interdimensional beings that you're seeing through the lens of a psychedelic. You tell that to anyone or most people in there like you are fucking crazy. You new age. Fucking read it. Anyway, so the point is the guy died in an insane asylum for suggesting people washing, wash their hands. That's how dirty everything was back then. That's how it effected everything was done in insane. This guy out of his mind and as you know, towards the end of his life, they said he got dementia, but I think it was just because he knew that he had discovered this thing, that he proved he could save so many lives and no one will listen to UNC.

Speaker 6:          00:20:31       Could you imagine, dude, if you were an advanced human and you were stuck in an advanced age that just refused to change, could you imagine if you were a scientist from 2011 and then all of a sudden you found yourself in the middle of the Spanish inquisition? You were. Everyone was ridiculous and people were just killing people and it was just insanity. He couldn't talk to anybody. Just religious fanaticism completely out of control and murder and all kinds of crazy shit was going on. Could you imagine? Yeah. That was your reality. All of a sudden,

Speaker 7:          00:21:02       religious fanaticism, violent wars raging everywhere. Talla, Tarian, presidents, corporations running everything.

Speaker 6:          00:21:13       This Michele Bachmann lady won the Iowa Straw poll. Yeah. What the fuck is that? He's a fucking dominatrix public and boys like to get spanked. We are living in fascinating times. It's when it's ripples like this, like when you hear things like this to me, they look like little little ripples on your universe, like wake up, pay attention. There's a lot more dumb people that you think, oh, more painfully stupid people in this country. A lot of them, tons of them, they can't see that she's dumb because they're way dumber than her. They're way dumber than her. They have no idea. She's dumb. They think she's got a good message and they they. They don't mind her crazy eyes. They don't see the crazy eyes. They don't see the gay husband. They don't see him. He seems like a Nice Fella. He's praying, yeah,

Speaker 8:          00:22:07       gay away. Grave. The gay away we'll go. We'll go to bunch of them and hold them hands. We're going to pray in their underwear,

Speaker 6:          00:22:18       were hugging each other, shooting loads in their pants. This is a ridiculous institution.

Speaker 7:          00:22:24       You have to learn how to shoot a load in front of men without wanting men.

Speaker 6:          00:22:30       What is it so hard for people to accept that people are gay? What do you give a fuck? They're gay. So what? Let them enjoy it. What do you. What if it doesn't affect you? As long as they're not trying to fuck you. Who cares what? I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense. You're going to pray it away where you're going. The gangway prelude,

Speaker 7:          00:22:53       but you gotta see gotTa. You gotta understand that relationship because I think about this relationship between Michelle Bachmann and her husband who was clearly gay, clearly runs what is. He's running a. that's a sex dungeon, Brian. That data

Speaker 6:          00:23:07       brian impression is really not that far off. Know he's so unbelievably gay stuff.

Speaker 7:          00:23:13       Seems Gay. Hey, say Scott, I don't know that he's gay for sure, but it might not be productive. You know that he's running a sex dungeon, a sex dungeon, you know, he is absolutely. Pray away. The Gay Clinic, that's a sex dungeon. Yeah, for submissive. Good gay guys. Submissive. Gay guys go in there. They go and it's like a fetish. It's a, it's a, it's like a fetish situation. It's like these get married, gay guys go into this place where an expert says that he's going to use religion to help them overcome being gay. The expert happens to seem like super gay, like super. Like he should be on the front of his own float in a gay pride parade, holding sparklers and feel like, I don't know, wearing like whether a bra or something. That seems right, but he's in a suit now and he's talking to you in that stereotypical voice. He's saying, we can overcome this thing. James, I need you to tell me though, every gay sexual encounter that you've ever had. You know, that's part of it. Okay. I'll tell Ya. You gotta hear it out, Talia. Yeah. Once I blew 17 guys at a bare party in New Jersey.

Speaker 1:          00:24:36       Oh, they alone. When this is happening, is it

Speaker 7:          00:24:38       dark? Yeah, it's dim. It's dim in there. There's candles of Jesus. Candace, I guarantee that place is covered in pictures of the sick erotic Jesus, the six pack. Jesus. You ever seen those where Jesus has painted with a six pack on the Cross, like a Jersey shore situation happening, but he's getting cruised. Whoa. There's tons out there. It's supposed to be starvation, but we look at it as like, wow, that's like hardcore crunches. That's not starvation, but what happens is a lot of these people, back when they were painting those pictures were just artists who are getting paid by the church and they needed to make money, but they liked the male form and so they were painting like they are making Jesus hot sex. Jesus erotic Jesus Christianity's true. Christianity is a lot of Christianity's fucking s and and think about it. The son of God comes down to the world and what happens? He tells the truth and he gets spanked and a crown of thorns and whipped with lashes and nailed to a fucking cross and everyone's into it like, did you see the passion of the Christ? That's an snm movie, man. I've been to the SNM clubs, tie guys up to fucking crucifixes and whip him there all the time, but I like black Jesus better. The whole theory of them.

Speaker 1:          00:25:52       Yeah. What is the black Jesus theory, but because Jesus was supposedly sephardic, wasn't it? Isn't that. Wasn't that the idea?

Speaker 7:          00:25:58       I don't know who's hotter, who's hotter. I think it's what I think it goes from is that everything has to start from black. Not White,

Speaker 1:          00:26:05       you know, I think it's fascinating that people want to a lay claim to something that people want to like that black people would go like Jesus was black, like, like it makes some handle that makes your life if Jesus was even real, but it makes your life today in 2011. Like you can lay claim to that. Like we did that we did. How annoying is that? Like you lay, click like Italians, like hey with Allianz, you know, we built that, we did that. You know, we did that. It's not really we dude, here's we really in this group together here, black Jesus, babies lack a child. Wow, let's find Jesus Dot Com. Well hate man. That's just as likely black. Jesus is just as likely as white. Jesus both of were just so squirrely

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       and so you're just supposed to believe that the dude came back from the dead and the and that anybody would write that he would come back from the dead. Anything else that you would read from them would not be equally ridiculous because we understand dad. Now we understand that now and you're, you're, you're saying that we must discount at all scientific knowledge ever just because there's an ancient book that says some some stuff and if you go along with it, you have to just assume that this was a one time thing and that this one time, these amazing, miraculous things that defy science happened and we just have to assume that these people who barely could write shit down. We're super accurate about it. Like it's ridiculous.

Speaker 7:          00:27:26       Let's even think one step before that, which is the religion that they've built around this thing that based on all scientific evidence is possibly a myth. They have their religion. They based around this character. Jesus is nowhere close to the things the character said in the book that they read. Jesus didn't walk around saying, you need to go to church. Here's an idea. Go to build a church and every Sunday go to the church and sit down and an uncomfortable seat and read prayers prewritten from people that you barely understand and then give 10 percent of your income to this group of people and just trust that they're going to use it in the right way. Jesus never said anything like that in the, in the, uh, New Testament. If you read this stuff, mostly the idea of the thing seems to be if you love the people around you as much as you can, and if you're tuned into God or the love force of the universe and you love that too, then you are going to have a great life.

Speaker 7:          00:28:31       That seems to be the message. You don't need a priest. You don't need a church. You don't need anybody. You don't have to follow the rules of the time he was, you know, in Judaism there are very strict rules about how you're supposed to live. And he was saying, we don't have to follow these rules. I don't have to do anything that you're saying. I have my own direct connection with the super intelligent, super abundance of the universe and that's all I need, and so then they killed them. So you've got that and then what builds up around it? Fucking Michelle Bachman, pray away the gay, just like Jesus want to. Jesus didn't want somebody sticking their technical and somebody excretory, a tube and the bid. They. Jesus wanted people straight. Only fucking vaginas. The creator of the universe. It gives them a migraine headache to know on this planet. People are sticking their fucking genitals and the other people, the assholes. That's how does that get trends? How does that get translated from basically the first hippie? Love each other. Tune into this superintelligence. It's really creepy and weird.

Speaker 5:          00:29:34       Well, whenever you have some obscure, I don't want to say obscure, but very difficult to put

Speaker 6:          00:29:42       into modern words statement like whenever you read any of the any chapters of the Bible, any, any passages, and he thinks that people quote all the time. There's a lot of the stuff. You'll read it and you go, well, what exactly does that mean? Like what is, you know, trying to back up and, and decipher that into modern language. What was it originally, you know, I mean, we know it all came from ancient Hebrew and then they kind of take it from ancient Hebrew to Latin Greek. Like what the fuck was, what would you know? It's totally different language. What was the original meaning behind it?

Speaker 7:          00:30:15       Well, you got like, but you know, I used to, when I was in college, take lsd and I read the New Testament and it was the most awesome psychedelic thing ever because you're reading it and you're thinking like this. No matter what this is, it's shaped so much of society. These words are shaped so many people's lives. And so just from that alone, it's super psychedelic. But what did it come from? What's the original language? What's it based on? There's all these awesome ideas, you know, because there's a lot of books of the, in the gospels that didn't make it in to the final cut that are equally valid and are far more esoteric and uh, have like really weird ideas. I've read stuff that it's based in like this form of religion called Gnosticism, which I don't know too much about. I've heard that it's like some weird desert called called these scenes or that it's somehow the formulation of all these different desert mysticisms kind of merging into the, you know, they embodied it in the form of this person to transmit this bigger information about the idea that they're, you know, we're all children of some super intelligence and that if we give up our, um, greed and selfishness and love other people, like we love ourselves, then that would create like a, you know, if everyone did that, then we would be living on this would be utopia.

Speaker 7:          00:31:41       We will be in some kind of super communist, mystical, spiritual state where everyone's completely connected with each other. Like imagine really feeling about everyone around you the same way you feel about yourself. It means don't differentiate other people from your life. No more differentiation. We're all the same. We're all completely connected. We're all children of this universe and so we should treat each other love.

Speaker 6:          00:32:06       Yeah. That doesn't work with society though, unfortunately. Like we would do, they would have to be some gigantic event that got rid of get rid of currency or got rid of the idea of competing for currency because until p, as long as people are still competing, competing for job positions, competing their company against other companies, and as long as there's capitalism going on that, that push for money, that push to make money, that's. You're always going to get this same kind of Douchey, cunty, chimp behavior. You know, it's a competition. There's a, it's obvious way. Obvious that most people are working way harder than is both healthy and is desirable. They're working ridiculous hours and pushing harder than ever because they need more money. They want more money, they need more money. It's like there's a drive, like a fucking wild machine behind it, you know?

Speaker 6:          00:33:03       That's as long as that's there. Fuck man. How are you going to get everybody to just just have resources available? You're going to trust people to work. You're going to trust everyone to put in their share. Like all of us are going to trust all of us and what do we do when someone doesn't. Even if we're supposed to love them, we love ourselves. We just supposed to let them just fuck everything up all around them and let them go into super sabotaged spin out mode where they destroy everything in their vicinity and nobody stops him from doing that because that's like a spoiled child. We've seen that

Speaker 7:          00:33:33       before. Yeah. That's the other crazy aspect of Christianity. Is it ultra pacifism? It's like super positivism and the message of the thing was supposed to be, look, this being that they're killing is the physical manifestation of the universe. It could do a, could fight back. It could shoot lasers out of its eyes. It's a superhero, but it's letting itself. I don't know. I'm calling Jesus in net. Whatever he is, he's a wedding. It's a wedding itself. Get killed to give a message, and the message is this. There are some things that are more important than life and if you want to get caught up in this dimension and you want to save your body, you want to try to save your body, go ahead. It's going to die no matter what. You're dead meat. It's like there's no way you're going to make it through this dimension.

Speaker 7:          00:34:20       No one, no one makes it out alive. Whatever Jim Morrison said, we all know and gets out of this alive. We all die. So if you want to like focus and fixate on protecting yourself, fine. But the idea is like the, you're supposed to completely surrender to this energy. Right? And then when in regard and once you really make that move, which they say is an act of faith, which I mean, I, by the way, this is purely speculation. I have not given my heart to Jesus, but I am. I think about, you know, what would happen if you did just become completely everyone. Yeah. What would that be? I mean obviously it's not possible,

Speaker 6:          00:35:02       right? But why? But why and who would make cars and how could there be competition? How is there this, you know, how would there be any form of capitalism? The way we have it right now, how? How would our society, the monetary system, how would it be set up the way that it wouldn't be? It couldn't be. It's impossible. It's impossible

Speaker 7:          00:35:22       exists. The church couldn't exist. Society couldn't. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:35:25       so how would we revamp it? How would we, how would we put it all into perspective? Put it all into order. How would we ensure that everyone follows along with it? We're not. Is that like a net? Is that next stage of evolution is the next stage of evolution. The idea that people have gotten to a point technologically where we can start to join together as one thing. Again, you know what I'm saying like that there had to be a certain peak of competition to get us to a point where we have created some really boundary dissolving technology and when that point happens, then through that very technology at as in the Internet, people slowly start to assimilate to some level of understanding and awareness that wasn't previously achieved because there was this constant state of of competition to try to get to that

Speaker 7:          00:36:17       technological point and that's where you run into a problem because once you start getting to that state that you're talking about, and I think a lot of people are. We add it right now. We are right? Yeah, and that's when you get to that state and suddenly you're in Egypt because you're starting to understand about what's going on and you're you. You're getting this information from the Internet showing you what other people in other parts of the world, how they are living. The point is suddenly like a lot of shit start seeming really like we've been asked to believe a lot of stuff and Kinda like you ask your kids to believe a lot of stuff when they're growing up and you do it to keep them safe. You tell them these stories and you want them to believe it, but eventually your kid knows that, you know whatever story you told him about where the baby came from is coming from isn't completely real and your kid's going to start wanting to know the truth.

Speaker 7:          00:37:08       And then at that age you tell your kid the truth and it's uncomfortable or whatever. Even tell them the truth. But now it's like we still have kings. We have kings and Queens. Their king. There's still serious kings and you're expecting people to keep believing this king is any more special than anyone else. I. Okay, you want me to keep buying this thing about the king, about how he gets to wear the throne and gets to have the giant fucking a mansion that he lives in and all this property lives in because he's a king and he's in the bloodline is somewhat. What are you talking about? We're all the same man. I got to keep playing this fucking masquerade party with you. Unbelievable. Yeah. How much longer do I have to do this? Because I'm hungry. It's like that kind of stuff. People are like, okay, okay, so you're a president.

Speaker 7:          00:37:54       Oh I get it. Okay. So I guess I'm supposed to believe that there's a government, which is mostly just like 120 year old men in a room. I'm supposed to believe they're the ones who know how to do everything and that system the right way and it's like all that stuff starts, you know, spreading or people like, I don't know if I can believe the whole. You're a cop. I'm a person thing getting kind of hard for me. I mean, I believe it because you got a billy club and you're fucking beating my friend in a wheelchair to death, but I'm not sure if you really represent the real authority of the world. And so that kind of stuff starts emerging in emerging as people evolve and the authority and the world like, fuck, I gotta believe the game. If you don't believe it's fucking game, where did we don't know what to do? What are we gonna do? We can't just reformat everything all of a sudden. I.

Speaker 5:          00:38:37       So do you think that law enforcement almost inhibits evolution by creating this culture where people are getting constantly in trouble with things?

Speaker 7:          00:38:46       Yeah. Well, you know what law enforcement, a lot of law enforcement is, it's delivery drivers for the prison industrial complex. They deliver fucking bags of gold to the prisons. Drop them off at the door and they fucked. You make so much money. I think we need cops. We need cops. No question about it. Watch that. Richard Pryor joke about like, well, we need prisons. Have you ever seen that? So funny, but we need. There are aspects and elements of society that need to be in a cage. Yes, absolutely. But you know, you don't need to be in a cage or smoking pie. You don't need to be in a cage for taking your acid or taking mushrooms. You don't need to be in a cage because you told people that the military was using fucking military choppers, the gun down reporters, and you had the balls to tell that to the world.

Speaker 7:          00:39:31       That's no reason to put someone in a cage. So it's like it's some point as a certain number of people realize, okay, this is like a kid's game. This is a game of make believe that went way too far and I don't feel like doing this game of make believe anymore because it's destroying the planet. So you got to come up with a new game that works, but how are you going to convince those 60 or 120 old fucking drooling men shitting their pants, getting payoffs from the tobacco companies writing bullshit laws with our visitation. How are you going to like convince them like, you know what? What do you guys mind going home and we're going to get some like young people in here because they understand more.

Speaker 5:          00:40:13       Do you understand the world? But we don't understand the economic system. Yeah. I'm sure some young people do lose young people right now protesting, listening, saying, I know I understand it.

Speaker 7:          00:40:22       Correct. Look, I know I. I don't, I don't understand it. All I understand. Is that video, did you see that video I sent you today? Did you watch that? Fucking. Oh, it's a marine who is like, you know, he starts off and kind of dramatically rips off his is a fucking metals and he's like, I'm not gonna do it anymore, and then he just starts going into graphic depictions of the different innocent people he killed and he was in Iraq and how like the marines at completely different when there's embedded with them a reporter than they do and how the is now. Now is this real? I didn't investigate it. I hope it's not real. I hope it's. It seemed very real and he talked about how his squad commander, whatever it's called, said that they would, he would congratulate them on their first kill and he said whichever one of you makes your first kill by stabbing someone to death, I'm giving you four days leave and why? It's like that kind of shit. Like how are you going to convince those guys?

Speaker 9:          00:41:21       You know, we should all just love each other. Every general.

Speaker 7:          00:41:26       How do you stop it? You don't, you can't. There's no way to stop it. There's no way to stop it unless somebody invents something that think would

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       change the world and I'd be glad to tell you what it is. What is it

Speaker 9:          00:41:38       had genetic scientist needs to figure out a way to put lsd and have a common cold so that any. So the. So the

Speaker 3:          00:41:49       psychedelic experience would spread like a virus through society. Whoa. And then like, but the problem with it is you'd have to figure out a way to design it. So it only. The tolerance is really huge. Civil a person only gets at once. That's the problem with it. Who knows? Maybe there's a doctor. The problem with it is I think there's several problems with that. Well, there's some other problems I suppose really up to you to decide whether people should be getting, but you're trying to invent this right now in your house right now, right? I'm not a chemist. I just, I'm just throwing it out there. Oh my God. He threw it out there. You really did you fuck? Yeah. Way To. Somebody might be actually thinking about this. I mean, what? So look, here's the idea. So. Okay, so let's just keep running things the way they're running.

Speaker 6:          00:42:33       No, I don't think that's going on either, man. I think you're. You're not happy with the pace that things are accelerating too. I'm thinking you can genetically engineer it on your own or can you? Maybe that's what you're there for. Maybe the guy who does that. That really is his purpose in the evolutionary chain. He was supposed to step in and just see a new leap that others weren't willing to take and so he dragged everyone along and he was responsible for the next hiccup in evolution. I just gave someone a manifesto. How about that? There's some fucking dude living in one of those loft apartments where you can drive your car up in an elevator and he's by himself right now. Carving is bullied of his knife.

Speaker 3:          00:43:12       Invest in tie dye and Hendrix now.

Speaker 6:          00:43:15       Okay, well that's an interesting fucking idea that someone could engineer a virus that would induce a psychedelic state.

Speaker 3:          00:43:21       Yeah. Or some kind of state. I mean, is that possible? I have no idea. I mean, I, I, yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:43:27       it seems. It seems like if it. It can affect your body the way some things can. Some codes can affect your body, should be able to engineer something that should affect it affects you

Speaker 3:          00:43:35       something that is a byproduct. It creates a tryptamine.

Speaker 6:          00:43:40       When you think about a man, when you, when you do Mtma and the next day you, you sort of feel like you came down from, from a cold, you sort of feel like you had a cold, so like your body was fighting something unless

Speaker 4:          00:43:51       you use roll off. Does that stuff work? Yeah, it does work. It doesn't really work well. It's not like he doesn't want to completely bring you to a 100 percent. I haven't, I haven't done much. Well I haven't done mdm made much or molly or whatever it's called a much. But uh, I did once without having that and then once with having it and it was totally big, big, big difference. There was no hangover at all, like the next day. And it's just like you take it before you do it and then after, right before you go to roll on and roll off, it's a. So you really didn't feel anything. Anything funky? No, I mean I, you're going to probably have a hangover no matter what, but I definitely felt that felt way better than the last time I did. I hate that feeling. So not only did that stuff

Speaker 6:          00:44:32       once because the feeling, it was too much though. That feeling was too terrible. I just felt I was in, I was in a coffee shop the next day and I bought a magazine with me sitting there drinking a cup of coffee, trying to read this magazine I couldn't read, couldn't focus, I couldn't focus on the words. I couldn't put my head into a paragraph, couldn't do it, and I was like, oh, this is terrible. This is terrible, terrible place for your brain to be. And I went on stage and I felt that it was like 80 percent. Even though I hit all the beats, right. I did all my material correctly. I felt like it was only like 80 percent, right. Like my brain was just not capable of totally connecting to an, to the material I was. I was, you know, like you know how it is when you're in the groove, when you're onstage, you're totally connected to the material.

Speaker 6:          00:45:21       You know where the beats are, you feel it, you're in the jokes, you know you're in there, you're, you're, you're totally in the moment, but sometimes not. And then this time I just could not force myself into it as I was saying everything correctly, but I couldn't quite keep up with it. Like I was like, this is terrible for your brain. I've never had that feeling before. It's like a feeling of like a, a, a dullness, like a dying battery. I felt awful. I hate it. It's not worth it, but I did learn a lot when I did it, man. Boy, I got a big lesson about, about, uh, insecurity. That's the thing that hit me the most is that God, if everybody was like, like in some sort of a way, the way people are during an acid trip like, or an MDM may trip, it's like you would, you never would have to worry about fights ever again.

Speaker 6:          00:46:13       You would never have to worry about people being douchey to each other. If somehow or another, the brain can be engineered to operate those rpms on a regular basis. Like as now the idea is that you take this Mtma, you take ecstasy, whatever the fuck it is and it, it makes you high for a brief moment and then brings you down. But what if the mind could sustain those levels of those chemicals on a regular basis? I mean, is that not possible? Why would anyone assume we could not evolve to that? If we've come to this point from some shit throwing know tree swinging little monkey people, if that's what we used to be and we've come this far, we can't take that other leap to have the levels of chemicals in our brains operate so that you would be like you were on ecstasy all the time. That would be the way to engineer a loving culture because yeah, I, I did not feel stupid when I was on it, which was very amazing that I could think very clearly, but I remember thinking, wow, how silly is our or my insecurities and my silly imagine like in another universe where instead of building an atomic bomb, Einstein, these scientists

Speaker 7:          00:47:30       had come up with these theories in physics have a way to create like a, some kind of device that blasts pure love and the people so that when it goes off the city that it's in, everyone in the city gets filled with like as though you are on the best ecstasy on the planet, that level of love. So you're at war with a country and instead of destroying them, you're just blasting them with love chemicals. So that there's no way that they can fight. He's going to poison a big population of

Speaker 4:          00:47:59       people with us are setting yourself up as that guy. You're Johnny appleseed for Christ. We're good at it. I think I actually said Johnny appleseed incorrectly, right? We have we ever discussed to Johnny appleseed, isn't it existed then what did he do again? He spread out apples throughout the midwest. You couldn't be, you wouldn't be the Johnny appleseed of ecstasy, Ecstasy. I, you know, I wouldn't mind.

Speaker 7:          00:48:25       That's what would be a great, great claim to fame. But I'm not going to like, I really obviously would never poison people if I. even if I had the opportunity, but at some point, you know, are drastic measures have to be taken. That's what I'm saying.

Speaker 5:          00:48:40       Well listen, what you're saying, you're saying that you're not comfortable with the speed at which evolution is happening. You, it's obvious that people are evolving, but you're not comfortable that people haven't reached your level yet. So fucking solution is to engineer some way to poison them.

Speaker 4:          00:48:54       Let me just dose them. You're going to use them as Guinea pigs and I'm for it. I'm on time for it to you for it. I think, uh, if it was 100 percent safe, yeah, but they would have to be all kids and black kids blankets. Well, no. Even if just kidding, I will not be. But what if it wasn't a hundred percent? Say Yeah, the 80 percent

Speaker 5:          00:49:19       they have to dig acid. All right? Some people are happy as fuck. Living a simple life and that is their prerogative. This is a temporary experience. And just because you see some great depth into it doesn't mean you can pose those ideals on other people that love a simple life. They, there's people that are genuinely like country music. They like feeding animals and they're like making fucking sweet potato pie and that's cool.

Speaker 4:          00:49:44       They're called my parents. Are Those your parents? Try and tickling. I'm not. Here's the thing I'm not talking about like literally you have. It's never, it's never going to happen. I don't know. But who could draw pictures of it? An interest? You have diagrams. At what point do you

Speaker 7:          00:50:03       do what anonymous is doing? At what point do you go from looking at the world and seeing some fucked up shit going down? What point do you go from talking about this shit going down to actively trying to fight against it?

Speaker 5:          00:50:20       See the Warren Buffet thing? No, Warren Buffet just wrote some big article on corporate taxes and why do

Speaker 10:         00:50:28       I have to pay so little taxes? Why do all my super rich friends get to bed taxes? Any described in detail. A bunch of crazy clauses that are in place that allowed these guys to only have like 17 percent taxes and especially people that make their money with money and you know, there's, there's all sorts of things that can be factored in and because of that they paid leave in less taxes and he's like, this is crazy. Like this is all engineered. Ridiculous. Like why are you protecting this super rich? It's really, really fascinating. It's really fascinating because he stepped up and, and set and it uses the terms, like my mega rich friends, my super rich friends, you know, he, you know, it really just kind of laid it all out. It's fascinating.

Speaker 7:          00:51:07       Were you know, when do we do something about it? What do we do? Because you got to do something. At some point,

Speaker 10:         00:51:14       you bring it down. Do we know who's going to build it?

Speaker 7:          00:51:17       Go, you don't. You don't have to bring it down, but at some point you. I just heard this thing. It's this guy that guy's a rant on. I don't even remember this show, but it went viral and it's this guy steamed up about Republican or Democrat. It doesn't matter. There's a system in place that is pulling the wealth of the nation into the overseas banking community or it was like really intense and it went viral. It went super viral, but then the question is, do we dose the irs or not? Know at what point at what point your bad trips, they would have math trips. Oh my God. It's a vision where they just literally stole their money and they weren't poor and it couldn't fucking food themselves, but when do you do? When do you see? Anyway, this guy said, we have a BOT congress.

Speaker 7:          00:52:03       He said, the congress is in the pocket of corporations. Whether this is true or not, I don't know, but I did read, if you go to a banners wikipedia page, um, it's felt boner, but painter b o e h n e r, if you go to his wikipedia page, it talks about one of these cons. One of the controversies around him was that there was a big vote coming up against big tobacco and right before the vote happened, he went and passed out checks from big tobacco on the floor to all these like senators or I don't want to passed it out publicly and I don't know why, what this exactly was, but so that guys bought. He's passing out checks from tobacco companies in our government like that guys bought. It's on Wikipedia, look it up and maybe someone can really explain to me why I did that or what, what, what has happened there.

Speaker 7:          00:52:55       So we have what's called a Bot congress. We have our leaders, many of them are in the pockets of the corporations. Their decisions are based on the will of the people. Their decisions are based on what's better for the corporations and the Mega Rich and fucking warren buffet just went out and talked about it. At what point do we as a people make that stop? When does it happen? Guess what? Democracy didn't work, didn't work. They beat it. They figured it out. Of course, they figured it out. It's like the Rubik's cube. You do it enough time. Somebody's going to fucking figure out a beat. The Rubik's cube. They figured it out. The fucking founding fathers talked about this very thing, the possibility of this kind of thing happening. It happened. Now what do we do? What do you do? Do you sit and drink starbucks and buy your fucking iphone and and and fucking play video games and get on a podcast from time to time and wine or do you fucking pig? When do you do something? That's what I want to know. When do people act like and that's why I'm so fascinated with fucking anonymous right now because they're acting. They're, no matter what people said, oh, they're just a bunch of 14 year olds at the basement of their Bob's house. I don't think so. They just fucking did it. They shut down train stations. They're shutting shit down there. Like black.

Speaker 4:          00:54:08       Yeah. One one step away is Obama is going to go on television going, okay, just so you know, we're now considering these guys terrorists. That's all it's going to happen. And then these 14 year olds that are in basements who are thinking they're doing a good job, are now going, okay, now we're going to get in prison for 60 years and now federal crime. Okay. No, I'm not worth them going back to work thing, but that's all that stuff all they need to do to stop, but for the rest of the history,

Speaker 7:          00:54:30       okay, for the rest of history, if every member of whatever this mysterious weird group is, gets arrested tomorrow for the rest of time, they still will exist as an organization. That was one of the first emergent, a revolutionary organizations in the technological age and to me that is amazing.

Speaker 4:          00:54:49       Oh, it's super amazing and I, I completely support them, but that they're just better watch out because I think that's coming. I think they're doing it. They're going to be considered terrorists.

Speaker 7:          00:54:59       The second course, I mean, our country considers anything that goes against their ideals, terrorism to the point where it's obvious that certain people aren't there in surgeons. Those are insurgents. What the fuck's an insurgent? Yeah. Those are people who don't want you invading their country. They're not insurgents. You're gonna. Call them an insurgent. Do you know how many fucking kids? And uh, Afghanistan died from a drone attacks. They just released it like 168 kids. Dad from drone attacks. A lot of insurgents apparently. Don't understand why you got to blow up toddlers. So the question is when, when, when did people choose?

Speaker 6:          00:55:35       I can imagine if you were living over there, if that's your role, the dice. You're a fucking mountain goat herder in Afghanistan and you literally are under the power of various warlords. No one city in the entire country cobble everything else. Assist warlords, warlords, dude or Lord, you know, you know how they get the information from the warlords? They give him Viagra. That's how they find out where the Taliban is. They give him Viagra. That's the number one move.

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       July. Hopefully you didn't learn that on cinemax after. Now. Dude, I read that online. I read it online. That's amazing.

Speaker 6:          00:56:16       Authenticated. It was on a major website. I don't remember what.

Speaker 4:          00:56:20       So what we know, but it totally makes sense. These old dudes,

Speaker 5:          00:56:24       they can't fucking anymore and they have all these. They all have all these hoes like when you're aboard, Lord, you don't have one wife. You've got to bang a wives. You got a gang of wives, right? He's like, sixties. Dick doesn't work anymore and he's got these 20 bitches. He's trying to hold down.

Speaker 7:          00:56:37       It's hard. Yeah. It's not like you can order Viagra when you live in a fucking deadly valley.

Speaker 5:          00:56:43       Like they even knew about it. Right? I bet the first time they ever dropped it and they're like, get the fuck outta here. Wow. I killed it. Makes your Dick hard. Like what color geniuses are out there? Well, I'm herding goats on a mountain somewhere. It's fucked up that we can use those drones and other countries that we're not even supposed to be at war with Pakistan. Just sneak a drone over there and shoot some shit. All right, we're going to leave now with hell fire missiles. That's the craziest thing they named them. They don't have the name like h, two, five, six, no. Hell fire. Hellfire missiles fired. Actually. Then maybe they do. Maybe the hellfires that nickname. Mad, angry, angry, efficient autos to follow up.

Speaker 7:          00:57:26       It's so creepy, man. If you think about that stuff too much god, especially if you man, if you eat mushrooms and your brain decides to start thinking about the Taliban. Oh God, that's the worst. You just. I've rolled against the wall of my fucking apartment, clutching my head with visions of bearded strangers, strapping suicide bombs to their bodies and wandering into the streets to blow up other people. When you really consider that this happens at this very second, right now, there's two things happening. There's a guy at fucking Halliburton who's screwing the top on a hell fire missile that no doubt will land in some playground in Afghanistan and a center eight some toddlers, and he's like, ah,

Speaker 3:          00:58:13       almost off work

Speaker 7:          00:58:16       these. I got a screw on. There's that guy and then there's some guy in the Middle East right now strapping a fucking belt around his waist and he's got a little time or a phone and he's buttoning everything up and he knows that any second, like in the next hour or two, he's going to be hamburger meat all over some fucking cafe or hotel. That's so weird. We live in. These are the two insane people and I frankly think one's a lot crazier than the other and it ain't the fucking guy with a bomb belt.

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       It's the fucking Weirdos, like just screw in the top side. Ms Dot wonder where these are going to go. Keep pushing these bombs. Here's another box of Gloucester. Oops. Ah, Shit.

Speaker 7:          00:59:02       I wonder why it malfunctioned like that. Perhaps we should analyze the four. 13 chip a. You just killed toddlers. Oh yeah, of course. But I wonder what it. What it is. Maybe the battery malfunctioned batteries malfunctioning in your heart. Murderers. That's the thing. It's like, why are we doing this? The fuck's going on that poppy field thing on internet where you're talking about

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       the soldiers standing in the poppy fields, yet another thing not to listen to when you're fucking begged, that'll send you a hireling into a paranoid episode quicker than seeing your grandmother.

Speaker 5:          00:59:31       That has never been a more clear indication that they're in on it than soldiers guarding poppy fields. And for me, he just to. You got it. At a certain point in time, you got to go, wait what? They had uriel, Geraldo Rivera, and he was interviewing one of the soldiers. There was like, yeah, well we don't like it, but we have to guard the fields. Uh, in order to get information for these people, we have to let them live their way of life. Like, what are you talking about, son? Are you really telling me you're letting people grow heroin? And you guys are guarding it. But that's it. That's all. You don't have any financial stake in it. You know, we're, we're taking American lives and they're over there with machine guns, gardening poppy fields. For who? By who? Against who? Excuse me, what the fuck is going on? We don't know. Where's the money going? When you're, you're, you're, someone's getting paid. You fuck. You don't have soldiers one or two fields. Unless there's some money being exchanged. Hands, period. That's expensive to feed us. Why the fuck would they put the resources of those soldiers? Why would they put them to use in that area like that?

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       You know what that makes me think though, man. How fucking cool would it be to have your own army? Wouldn't that be awesome to have like 200, like an army? There's people that know what it's like to have an army to have like a. are you with having an army?

Speaker 5:          01:00:46       Well, you know what, what, what happened with Blackwater, right? Do you know what happened with now? Supposedly this is all supposedly the uh, they just got some giant crazy contract with the United Arab Emirates and they're gonna, you know, I think it's like an Abu Dhabi, maybe I not. They're starting like a private military. You know, he's putting together some crazy mercenary group to shut down uprisings and make sure that no, no, nobody shit happens and they'll lose all their money.

Speaker 3:          01:01:13       I heard of. I actually heard about this. Isn't it called Cobra? I don't know. I don't know if it's true. It's true. Called Cobra. Cobra. I made that up as well. This guy

Speaker 5:          01:01:26       who was the, um, the guy that was the head of Blackwater is apparently got some huge deal to go over there. So I read a line that would make sense, man. If I was some fucking dude in the Middle East like that. Oh, I was a king. I was like, I need to protect this shit. I don't have to hire them. And once you get to that position, we ain't going to let that go. No one's letting that go. Why would you let that go? I'm the king to shut the fuck up. I got a new army where we got shit a lock down. Like you're going to resist any form of the simulation. I don't

Speaker 3:          01:01:53       care what you song. Google a palace. I got to keep up. What would it be like to be a king and have an acid trip? Really deep acid trip. That's great. I think so, yeah. Like having a fucking Harem tripping on acid and knowing you had access to a Harem and things got weird. Don't you think you would freak out thinking about all the people that hated you and all the people that wanted you dead, all the people that wanted your throne. Sure. You just get the joke to dance

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       for you and you'll forget about it. I mean just being living in any sort of a place where there's one person that is thought to be the king, the king king, King of Jordan and the King of Egypt, the king and the queen of. That's got to be a terrifying position to be the king. Yeah. You must be totally paranoid all the time. Yeah, of course. I mean, look at that. Look at President Obama has got to ride and he's got to ride into kind of bulletproof fucking hearst thing course also because he's black. Let's be honest. That's the real reason. The real reason. That's a big reason why people try to kill Ronald Reagan. Of course. You know, people would think someone there wasn't there some sort of a thwarted attempt against, um, it was something about George w dot, but they got it like way before anything happened.

Speaker 5:          01:03:04       It was a grenade I think were trying to elaborate on stage. Either way. There's, I mean there's, there's always, there's always one crazy faction of society that wants this, this president dead or the United States president did for whatever reason. But I always feel like with Obama, like the shit that I hear online and the things that I've read, it's like the racism. It's pretty obvious, man. There's a lot of people don't just not like him as a person. They don't like him because he's black. Oh, funny. Talk about it pretty openly and calm a monkey and calm. Like it's like, it's really, really fucking fascinating. Like the, the level of disrespect. You know, the idea. You just imagine right now the way you're going to feel the day after Michele Bachmann gets elected, if she kinda liked to imagine how you going to feel. I'm going to feel, I'm going to feel how much money does it cost me every year to live in Vancouver and I called my accountant and I'm going to say, all right, now, tell me what I would have to do.

Speaker 5:          01:04:05       I'd have to pay taxes in both places. Okay. I can do that though and I can live there and I keep. I can still be United States Senate said, let's fucking do it. I would just do it. I just moved the fuck up there is the way racist felt when Obama got elected. Of course that's been rocking sense of like horror that some people had, not because of his views, not getting his ideas, but because he's black. They were like, oh my fucking God. This is it. This is it. Charlie over sudden. Amazing. Yeah. That's amazing. So yeah man, it's completely out there. And then you add onto that the fact that he fucking didn't exactly hit a home run to put it lightly duty. He stepped up to plate and got hit with a meteor shower. I mean, I don't think any president had any chance of making any of this. Look good. There was a gigantic scheme going on. It collapsed and created this vortex of suck and unemployment and home foreclosures and anybody stepping into that vortex would have been sucked into its momentum. Yeah, ducks that while he was in that fucking vortex, he like started

Speaker 10:         01:05:17       saying that people could start rating medicinal marijuana. Dispensary is again under him. They started doing that. Did they say that they rated them because they violated both state and federal law? Do you know because that was one of the claims that Obama says. He never said that he would stop rating medical marijuana clinics. I think the, the, the language they used was they were going to stop unless they were violating both state and federal law. So if someone was selling marijuana, you automatically violating federal law, but are you staying within the state guidelines? If so, then we're going to leave you alone, but if not, then we're gonna go after you and that's what they did. That's what he said. Because I heard there was a new thing that's. I don't know. I heard I heard that too, but I didn't investigate it enough to be talking about it, but very hard for me to hate our country so much.

Speaker 10:         01:06:08       Duncan. No, I love it, but let me be clear about this. I don't think we're happy. I'm not happy until there's full legalization and here's the problem with this idea of medical is that I believe, at least in my, the way I understand it, that it can be interpreted, that the only way you're supposed to be running one of these collectives and dispensary's is you're not supposed to be making any profit. I believe they're supposed to be not a nonprofit sort of a business, but obviously these people are making a fuck load of money, so it's a very tricky sort of a gray area that's going on right now, so I'm not, I'm not even happy with just the medical distinction. It's silliness. It's 2011. Any argument about giving any, any inches or any. Just anything at all in that direction. Like, okay, well maybe we should make it illegal. If you're not, stop it. It's a fucking plant. All right. You can't. You can't make it illegal. You can't. It's a fucking plant. It grows in the ground. You can't say it's no good if it's not. It's not a poison. How come there's all these plants that grow strychnine? They make strict none. They don't. They don't. You can buy them.

Speaker 4:          01:07:18       You could sell Salvia at target and I would think that Salvia is way more dangerous for kids.

Speaker 10:         01:07:24       Salvia plants the nursery. Go check. That's the same type of Salvia. I don't know, but I do know that they sell the San Pedro Cactus at like Home Depot San Pedro. Cactus is how you get Mescalin. Wow. Yeah. That's where pod comes from. You can take that fucking cactus and you can, if you know how to do it. There's a whole, there's a bunch of, you know, like, uh, forums that will show you how to go through step by step process online. Yeah, man, it's fucked up. Fucking. It's ridiculous. It's not just fucked up. It's like that. If there's a, there's a one thing that has to happen, the first thing that's going to happen. And people don't put as much stock into this idea because it seems like a silly request, but if you could fix anything about the world, what would you do? I'd make psychedelics regularly available and legal and have people and devote energy and money to studying them and

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       distributing them correctly and get people who are showmen to take people in authentic trips, people who have navigated these worlds. And then when the people come back and they need like help with this reprogramming. You sit down with them. You have groups of people that have also had the experience to sit down with them. Discuss what about it? Did it make you think about yourself? Was that it? Was there anything that like glaringly obvious you needed to change? And then you know, the person would say, yeah, we'll, there's this fucking thing that freaks me out. I'm kind of a cheap fuck. And I think we need to deal with that. Right? I mean, you're kind of selfish. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know what it is. I just like, it's fucking, it's a force of habit and if you're, if you have any weird sort of a personality tick like that and you do any psychedelic, even eat pot, just eat, eat a cookie, Matt.

Speaker 6:          01:08:57       That's the first thing that's going to hit you. You're going to think about being a creepy person. Think about your creepy behavior. You know, and if, if there's ever a way to reengineer society, it's to shock people out of their current pattern of behavior that they find almost unavoidable. The same patterns that caused people to overeat or chronic masturbation. The we have to figure out a way to blast people out of those shock you out of the pattern. Show you yourself from an angle or perspective that's not available without the psychedelic, than bring you back and give you something to think about. You know, it's like these little trips, these little blasts, the just little bursts of evolution. It's society. You see yourself, you see how you can fit. You see, Nice, you see positive, good. I'll see you in a couple months and just keep doing that.

Speaker 6:          01:09:47       And every couple months people go in and get blasted, talk to people, people, talk them through situations and tell them about ego. And then it's all a trick and it's just temporary anyway, men, the most, the best feeling you'll ever get is to be really cool to as many people as you can, the best feeling you'll ever get. It's just to be nice to as many people as you can. Be friendly to them, shake their hand, hug them if you can, and just be someone that other people enjoy to be around. When you do that, you create positive energy. You create love. You create this, this, this, this burst comes from you and you attracted and you bring it into your seeing a couple of months and then the guy goes back every couple of months, did one trip after another and a year later you gotta. You can't even recognize this guy. A year later, this guy is fucking eating organic food and drinking coconut water and go into cross fit and reading about the Bhagavad Gita and he become a different human being. You become a human being. That's, that's actualized.

Speaker 11:         01:10:51       That's a good word. It's a good word.

Speaker 6:          01:10:55       You know, that is possible. You can evolve without drugs. You can evolve just with hard work and focus and attention in meditation or you can just take the drugs and get there way quicker. It's up to you man. Go crazy. And combined it two, you know, you don't. It's not like we can only do one or the other. Actually I found the combination of the two

Speaker 7:          01:11:14       is amazing. Getting really high and chanting is such a perfect synergy. It's the, it's so fun to do, but I mean getting high, doing anything, it's pretty

Speaker 6:          01:11:24       to be the most amazing is getting high and doing yoga. Dude, I love to get super big. I'll get begged and hotel rooms and I'll do yoga. I got like some, a few dvds and I got one thing that I've downloaded that I can watch on my laptop doomed get which is bullitt streaked. So you're just in tune with every fiber of your muscles and you're holding these poses and I'm reading from this book that as this fucking black and white photo of this Indian dude doing it from 1934 and he's doing these crazy ass fucking poses and I'm holding him in his hotel room and then after I'm done, man, it's like it takes the high and brings it to this completely new room. It's super clean and it's like you sit here in this new room and just this is just relax a little until the yoga wears off. Then you can go right back in. It's like it puts you in some crazy new high room or you're like, I can see things so well right now. It's like my body's in balance. My mind is imbalanced. I can see things so clearly. Troubling. Decision seemed so obvious.

Speaker 7:          01:12:35       I would love to see both of your favorite thing to do high together at the same time, like you chanting and you're doing yoga in the same room. I think that you guys should do that sometime. It'd be very well, but we can put that online and dudes. Right.

Speaker 8:          01:12:44       Beat off to fucking God. Bear 69 cock beat officer thing. Cool. I love your asshole

Speaker 7:          01:12:56       Henry. Awesome. Can I ask you something? Brian started talking about it. So what'd you think of planet of Apes? Listen Bro. Oh, here we go. I got

Speaker 6:          01:13:06       way more chimping me than the average person. So you put me in movie with chimps. Start fucking shit up. I get very excited. All right. I thought the CGI was the shit I thought for a movie for like what? I like to go to the movies to say I want to see some fun shit. I like comic book movies. I like, you know, like x men was the latest Eczema and I really liked that one a lot. I liked that kind of shit. I like ridiculous movies. First Class. I just liked that one. I liked shit. That's like, I like stuff that's fun, you know, I wanna I want to just get into it. And to me this movie was so. First of all the special effects were fucking insane. So close to perfect, swell. Close to seeming like real chimps.

Speaker 7:          01:13:53       Can I say something? Yeah, here we go. I don't want to see it. You haven't seen it? No, I've seen it, but I don't want to see chimp cock. But none of those chimps that genitals. It's true from PG. Thirteen. Well, it's not that they didn't have genitals, they just never showed you an angle where you could the deck.

Speaker 12:         01:14:11       Here's the thing was just clever photography. Everything. Everything that you've just described about the movie. I agree with the CGI was fucking cool and there were some really cool moments, but what bothered me about the movie or really bothered me about the movie, um, was the penis and what made it, what made it kind of what made me really start eating it a halfway through and get embarrassed by it and just think, oh, I'll never go see a fucking movie again in my life. Yeah. I got so pissed because I saw at the beginning fucking News Corp and I was like, oh, here we go. How did fucking Rupert Murdoch fuck this up? How did he fuck it up? These chimps, these fucking chimps who have been tortured in laboratories who I've, I told you by the time I almost got killed by a chimpanzee already, right?

Speaker 12:         01:14:55       I told you that story. When was this? I didn't tell you that story. Even if you did tell him to tell me again. I'm sure a lot of people never heard of it. Tell me. So I, for this pilot I did for comedy central, we had a chimpanzee as one of the gags where I was playing chess with a chimpanzee and the chimpanzee beat me at a move. And so, so I go, I'm smarter than me. She's a stupid quick gag, like a computer hooked up to the champ and like the, it says checkmate, the commuters that. Right. So I was really excited about this day and my friend, uh, Tom Janice, who was the co creator of the show and directed it was, um, he, uh, he kept telling me, Dunkin, is that you? Do you think there's any way we could do this without a chimp or do you really want to have a chimpanzee?

Speaker 12:         01:15:41       Because I've worked with chimpanzees before and they're really hard to control on set and they're dangerous and I'm like, no, I want to work with a chimp man. I'm not going to say no to Oregon with a chimp and they're not dangerous and they're going to sense that I'm a nice guy and the chimpanzee is going to know I'm okay and it's going to be fine. I was looking forward to this for days because I've always wanted to fucking hold a chimpanzee. So a fucking. The chimp gets here, you know that. I know the chimps there cause it's punching. The hardwood floor is hard as it can, as it's coming down through to where we're shooting. It's just punching the floor, punching the floor, punching the floor, Bang, Bang, Bang. This fucking thing. It looks like if you took a toddler and just blasted it with steroids, it's like imagine the most muscular toddler with the worst case of add on the planet.

Speaker 12:         01:16:31       That's a chimpanzee. And so right before we started shooting, the guy says, okay, just so you guys know this, a very friendly monkey. I'm cold monkey or I'm sorry, chimp, I'm, I've, I'm going to get trainers sucks too much. I'm trying to determine is there a Harvard for chimp trainers? You just fucking get a chimp. If you say you're a trainer, you can rent the thing out. Don't you have to be a problem at all? Just or something. I don't know. Okay. So this fucking monkey. So he's like, just, you know, the chimpanzees, the most strongest person in the room if he comes up to you, he just wants to say hi. He's very friendly, just don't make any quick movements. And so suddenly this chimp is sitting in front of me and it goes from being like, oh, this is going to be cute to being like, this is no different than being with a tiger.

Speaker 12:         01:17:23       This thing is fucking strong. It seems kind of focused in core right now. But it was being a little weird earlier. How big was it? Uh, I, I don't, I don't know the weight of the thing. It was probably like a little higher than my waist, like with a, with a chimp crouch happening. So you say maybe 70 pounds, 80 pounds? Um, I'd say like a, probably 80 pounds or something. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So it's not a baby? No, it's a, it's a middle aged little guy wearing blue jeans. I think it's more than 100. I don't. I don't know. It wasn't. No, I could. I don't know. I could've picked it up. Muscular Shit. Right. So the real muscular. So we're, we're starting to do the scene. Chimps. Got to move a piece, by the way, for animal rights people out there.

Speaker 12:         01:18:07       I will never, ever, ever, ever use a chimpanzee again in anything that I ever do. I don't advocate it. It's cruel. It's a horrible thing. It's fucked up. These creatures belong and habitats are in the wild. They do not belong on a movie set. They're very cool, very cool creatures. But that's a. it's a terrible thing. I agree. Totally. I'm fucking sitting there and the basically in like two seconds, the chimp went from being calm and kind of focused to screaming at the top of its lungs and shooting past me. It may be 20 miles per hour, like like there's no way I could have reacted if it wanted to pounce on me. I couldn't have blocked it. It was just this bang, like a whitening bullet shoots by me and runs to the top of this divider. So now it's pulling like a King Kong.

Speaker 12:         01:18:59       It's like it's screaming at all of us and I'm like, fuck. I'm feeling the worst sense of guilt and fear. Anyway, we'll get it back down. Holy Shit. We get it back down. Everything's fine again. It's like nothing happened. I didn't just freak out and just have it. It's cool. Gets off. It's like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Hold on. This thing freaked out. And you went back to work with it again. Yes. Oh my God. I went back to work, went back to work to get the shot. Man. It's low budget and fuck it man. Let's go for it. So what if I lose my hockey? And I was terrified. It was a bad decision in retrospect to them in the moment. I decided to do it. So things in front of me again and it's calmed down and it's kind of cool. Now I look over, the trainer is sweating like, you know, nervous sweat, like nervous, nervous sweat. And I swear I hear the guy who's with him whisper to him. Should we go ahead relationship? Not yet. He yells, yells at the guy. So I'm thinking like, did he just suggest that they dart the big dark the chimp or something? Like they calm it down like something's not right with the chimp right now. So anyway,

Speaker 12:         01:20:14       thing goes for me again, not for me, but shoots out of the chair again. The guy tackles it. Football tackles the chimp, right? Football tackles this poor fucking creature. The guy hits his head on a chair, he hits his nose on a chair from tackling the champ. The chimp didn't, uh, the chimp didn't bite him, but he, he, he hit his nose. I saw him do it. So because he tackled the champ, why do you tackle the chimp? He saw something in the chimps eyes that made him think, I got to tackle this chimp. So he tackles the chimp. He stands up every, I look around, the crew is like white faced. I'm sitting here frozen in terror. I look over the chimp is projectile vomiting bananas because that's what they do and they get anxious and the was like, guys, we can go on. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Blood running down his face from where he slammed into the chair, just blood just gushing down the guy's face.

Speaker 9:          01:21:13       And uh,

Speaker 12:         01:21:15       no. I'm like, no, you know what? I think we got it. Let's, let's call us. Let's call this a day. And that, that happened man. Those fucking things are fast and deadly and dangerous and fucking kind of half insane because they're out of their environment. So when I went to see planet of apes and the first time one of those chimps went to kill someone and the chimps like, no,

Speaker 9:          01:21:41       no,

Speaker 12:         01:21:42       you know, we mustn't kill. Let's let these humans live. I'm like, fuck that chimps. If they were superintelligent they'd be ripping people to like fucking Turkey on Thanksgiving. That's what annoyed me about it should have been brutal. It was more real that you wanted to be more realistic to see monkeys like written, not just by the way, like all these monkeys seem really good at jumping through a office glass. If they. If they weren't, it would be the most boring movie ever. If they're all hitting the glass and falling back, grabbing the workers in the office and slamming their bodies into the glass, like bean bags, it's splitting them like fucking so you didn't have fun with the movie at all. You couldn't look at it. I did think that some of that jump into the glass shit was ridiculous, but I was willing to let it go because it was a fun movie.

Speaker 12:         01:22:29       Yeah, that's what I would think. So me. It was just so fun. Bad ass moving. Listen, there is that part of my brains here that's like, well, this is fucking cool, but I'm not discounting what you're saying. I completely agree with you. If they went full chimpanzee, what a. What a champ would really be lucky. As intelligent. Who would be a horror film? A horror film of epic proportions with the chimps would storm the town and just kill all the people. Exactly. Utilize them. That's really what would happen. I saw this really cool picture on this website. I go to call this information and that sounds like a real credible source. It's a great website, man. They put up here the invitation dot. What did you. Where'd you get the article?

Speaker 5:          01:23:06       Oh, it was on disinformation.com. That sounds like you immediately just fall into one of those people that are constantly searching for the truth behind the lies. It's not a conspiracy side. It's more like it's a good site. I'm just. I'm just saying like I've go to her it all the time. I'm just saying that if that's one of those like hot buttons like disinformation dot Com Info. It's like a website cause we lie to you. They have the book to the people that have. You're being lied to. Is that the people that produce that book right in and the whole series of those books, which are great. Fantastic. By the way, books you. You realize. How many times do you have been lied to? All throughout history and it's like, Whoa, what the hell about that too?

Speaker 12:         01:23:48       Everything, but there's a picture on this site, have a painting. Someone did a planet of the apes and it's these apes with guns standing in front of a pile of dead human bodies like their hunters posing with like things that they've killed. Now. That's cool when I see that because then they're really playing that like we flip the script. Here's what we years that planet of the apes by showing monkeys behaving like humans do. It was a cool creative way to amplify the cruelty and humanity and brutality of humans. That was an important aspect of it is the monkeys were supposed to be a cruel to things that they didn't think were smart, so the fact that these are distant ancestors started off as like what appears to be. It seems like while that chimp was getting educated, he got a nice heavy dose of like some form of like, this is no spoilers by the way. Right? You're not going to drop some spoilers on us because I haven't seen it yet. It's planted the fucking names. If you don't know what's about talking monkeys.

Speaker 5:          01:24:54       Yeah. It's a little bit of a spoiler. Sorry. Look, I see what you're saying. I think. I don't think that. Oh, come on, man. That movie. It was fun for me. I enjoy the shit out of it, but you could make a movie where it would be all of the scenes from King Kong and from the hulk, whether they were just smashing everything and I would watch that movie. You'd be like 40 minutes. I would pay $20 to go see just a video of the whole fucking shit up for 20 minutes and fucking shit up. Yeah. That's so fun. The people screaming when he's stepping on them. The last King Kong. That's awesome. I just love the idea of the special effects. Did you like Godzilla as much? Yeah. I liked that when I was a kid. You know? What were those movies back then were so stupid. It's like you, you, you, we all agreed that we're stupid. We didn't think that was like a real monster. There was no doubt. That was not a real monster, but we were willing to go along with it because it was kind of fun. There was no doubt the water would not move that way if it was really the ocean that's a goddamn bathtub, there's no doubt, but we were willing to accept it because it was kind of cool movie. What? What's fun for me now is I just love

Speaker 10:         01:26:04       watching these artificially created creatures that have been rendered on a computer and people are interacting with them. That to me, like the King Kong scene, when when King Kong falls down in the newest king county falls down in between these two into a, like a big crater or something like that. It's a big canyon. Anyway, he falls down to this big crack and there's all these vines and shit and he's duking it out with trx is all along the way. Wally's like juggling this chick and while you're watching it's like, God damn, this is a motion picture piece of art. This is a masterpiece. What they've done. This really does look like a giant gorilla fighting off t rexes that's fucking bad ass and it's really. It really does look like kids interacting with trees. It really does. It's amazing when the fucking gorilla gets to the ground, starts duking it out with them and it's like, that really looks like a really.

Speaker 10:         01:26:58       This is incredible. Blown away by that shit blown away because I can't I when you hear about like computer languages, like I've watched John Carmax do this, this speech about the new technology in their game rage and like all the different cool tweaks and different things that they've done with it. Remember when we went there, when we were in Dallas, we got a chance to go. It's software. They let us go walk around the studio and look at the game before it was ever made. Dude, you will listen to him talk and it's like my brain is so far removed from any of this knowledge. I his what he's discussing with how they created video game moves, how they, how they have changed the way the game interacts with people and I know he's doing this with ones and zeros or numbers on white paper. It's so far. He's my. He might as well be an alien. He might as well be an alien. He might as well be a different species.

Speaker 7:          01:27:54       They May. Somebody was just telling me that programmers brain start working differently because they're constantly thinking and coding language and it creates this difference in the way their brains work, which I didn't really understand, but that totally makes sense. Yeah. When I just want. I use photoshop and I think like somebody built this, like somebody figured out how to do this, that, that is insane to me. It's who are these people? It's like we're giving academy awards and like huge awards and accolades to like symmetrical people who are really good at like reciting lines in a specific way. How come like the famous people in our society aren't these super geniuses who are building phones? Why don't we have like awards for people who make the crazy shit that makes our life so much better? It's really weird, Jonny Lynn's fit flair.

Speaker 10:         01:28:45       It is very weird. Well, let's. Because our society is sort of developed and evolved without much planning. It's sort of just happened and as we are this weird combination of evolving being an animal with needs and instincts, there's a lot of variables that don't get it accounted for as it'd behavior forms into patterns and you know, and cultures evolve around giant masses of land that it doesn't get planned out. But I always feel just like a field with any pattern that is established in nature. I always feel that the most fucked up human behavior, all of it. The whole pile of it all has got to all be natural. That's all almost unavoidable. That this is just what the human being does and as we are older and have much less responsibility than most people, you know, 30 years ago, you know, or rather a 300 years ago, our age were literally dying, you know, 500 years ago. How long, how long do people live in, you know, and it was, it was, it was normal. It was normal a thousand years ago.

Speaker 12:         01:29:52       Oh No, I looked at that. I think it's like 32 years. If you can look up the lifespan of people, it's like a thousand years ago. It's like 18 hundreds.

Speaker 10:         01:30:04       It's almost to me like we're not supposed to get old enough to see the hustle. Right? It's almost like we're. We're designed to die off right? When we start going, what? Wait a minute, what the fuck are we doing? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Everybody settled down. What do we. What exactly are we doing here? But that's when we were supposed to heart failure. That's what, that's what it should supposed to quit. But we're, we're alive so much longer now because of nutrition and medicine and people are just, they're more, they're more conscious. A first person like yourself has more free time as well and more free time to contemplate, and you're in a nonconformist occupation where you're not constantly pressured every day to thinking along certain lines because as a real issue with the American worker, you think you're given eight hours a day, but you're not given eight hours a day.

Speaker 10:         01:30:52       You're given eight hours a day, plus your behavior outside of work can't get much too crazy in comparison to your behavior inside of work or it's gonna Affect your performance at work. You can't be partying too much and coming into work hung over, so the whole thing must be regulated so everybody has to stay in La. You can get crazy and say sexist jokes around female coworkers or you'll go to jail. All right, you'll be arrested. You. You'll lose money because of sexual harassment. You know if you fire her, you, you, you're going to get sued and these are all that. This is all like an impossible thing to avoid. If you're not a normal person working a normal job, it's impossible for you to avoid your behavior being altered just so that you can work

Speaker 12:         01:31:37       well. Yeah, you're you heirs the game. If people forgot they were playing. It's called Western society and most people, the way they play that game is they have to. There's different roles they take. There's the worker in the boss, there's the executive as the president police officers, and it's all a game. When you go and buy, buy a starbucks. I learned this. There's a really cool meditative technique you can do that's part of this stuff, this guy gurdjieff talks about, but it's basically shows you how you're essentially just a series of automatic functions throughout the day. You're not even there, but at what you do is when you go to buy something, just be aware of the way you buy something. Watch the way your hand gets your wallet. Watch the way the money or the card comes out. Watch the way you swipe the card, watch the way you talk to the person and watch the way the person talks to you and what you'll see happening is something you've been doing for years and years and years and years and years and years, over and over and over again to buying shit because you live in America and that's how he fucking survive.

Speaker 12:         01:32:38       It's buying shit at the cash register. It's a just a great way to see how when you do that, your body goes into this automated function. Get the wall, pull the card, say thanks in a weird way. Look at the person. If you look at the person you're seeing an Automaton, you're seeing a person who has put their consciousness on the shelf, why they like all day long process people's cards, process people cards. So what you're seeing is two machines having this interaction and it's really fucking a great exercise to do because what you're seeing is a game that you've been playing so long you've forgotten you've. You're playing that game. You learned out a bit pot by shit at a cash register. There was a time when you'd never bought something at the cash register when you were a kid and then your parents taught you how to do it.

Speaker 12:         01:33:16       You learned how to exchange money for goods and that crystallized, do this ritual that you don't even know as a ritual. It's just this automatic thing, so this fucking game of Western society. It invites people to become automatons to get through the day when you're like, I used to wash dishes at applebee's and I can remember like the way that you would get through the day of washing dishes is you just go into this automatic trans. She's a trans, spray the dish, but in thing wash, scrub up, put it in anything. It's just an automatic trance. You're there, but you're not really there. You're just in a trance and you do it as an escape from the monotony and dullness of the job.

Speaker 1:          01:33:57       Well, it should be one person is cleaning their own plate. That's what it should be, right? It shouldn't be. There's a giant stack of plates in someone's job. It is to clean those things because that's when things start to suck. That's when jobs start to suck, when you're doing all this shit for money that no one wants to do. There's a big difference between that kind of a job and the kind of a job where you actually have a career and do things you enjoy like you and you get paid to be a professional comedian. Yeah, that's a, that's A. I mean, it's not even, it shouldn't even be classified as a job. Yeah. It doesn't feel like it. And call it a career if you want to get pretentious, but you know, it's your thing.

Speaker 12:         01:34:34       The career thing is a horrible word, man. It's a weird word because it makes you feel like, you know, I'm fucking serious grindstone. But it's the, it's comes the derivation of the word is a track. Horses ran on really circle. You'd never get anywhere. You just run into fucking circle. That's what a career is. I'm working on my career. Like the, the, the um, yeah. I think that I feel very lucky. I feel incredibly lucky. And also I feel like, uh, always on the precipice of absolute disaster. There's something really quite a, a peaceful about having a regular paycheck. Man, there's something really nice about that. That's fucking cool to now. Every two weeks you're getting a paycheck. That's bad ass, so that life of working a job and having a regular job, it is. There's sweetness to it, man, and it facilitates having babies and it facilitates a lot of aspects of life that I think are quite pleasurable on a really high level, so I totally get it. It's just a, you know, is there a way that this process that we're all engaged in this gigantic game that we're all in this crazy dance of Western civilization that we're all engaged in. Is there a way that we can take it up a level? Is there a way we can make it a little more aware of itself? A little more cognizant of itself, a little less embedded in superstition, and

Speaker 6:          01:35:58       again, I've got to go to what I said before is that I think that things are evolving. You just are not happy with the pace. I think that we live in such a tiny frame as tiny window of time and the amount of progress that we're looking at just from a thousand years to now is monumental 2000 years to now and human behavior, knowledge and access to information off the charts, how much it's progress and we're just caught in the middle of it and it's key. It's not going to stop with with the Internet and with the the access to information that's available now and the ability to communicate now. Truth is getting through more often than not. Truth is piling on. There's a lot of bullshit out there still, but it's way easier to cut the bullshit off with the Internet. It's evolving. It's just not evolving up to your speed, the what you would like to see, but just look at the way people think, act and behave now as composed as compared to the way they did turn truck. There's no question and that's not even a blink of an eye. Not even a blink of an eye. It's unquestionably moving in a certain direction and yeah, it's quagmired in greed and built on a foundation of unfixable bullshit, but it still spiraling towards the technological singularity question about it.

Speaker 12:         01:37:24       Some of the advancements that you're talking about are some of the things that you're like, wow, things have really advanced. It's because groups of people made active efforts to push against the and a, the anti evolutionary for

Speaker 6:          01:37:37       sure. I mean that's their role in this machine. That's their role in this, this process, this, the, you know, their, their role is to, to push things in that manner. No, I mean I think it's all an ingredient in a gigantic metaphysical sort of a soup and it's all piled in together there and know when everyone's doing their little part, but it's changing slow for our, our ideas and our tastes. But in, as you know, in compared to history that the rapid pace of evolution and the evolution of progress, the complexification of our society, it's blowing up in our face. We're hanging on tooth and nail. Literally, you know, there's a lot of people that still have even grasped how much it's changed. That's why when you have all these Wacko Gay Republican dudes, they get busted online, getting hookers, you know, getting male hookers like this new guy that just got caught.

Speaker 6:          01:38:31       Somebody just sent it to me on twitter. I don't know his fucking name, but you know the story. The story just keeps happening over and over again. The same goddamn story. This guy wanted to pay some dude to have sex with him and he got caught with it and it's fascinating. It's fascinating shit. Human animals, a very strange mixture of complex thinking and awareness and then some just wild monkey jealousy and instincts and fears and it's all piled together in this weird fucking biological machine and it just like God figure this out. We've got a bunch of things pulling you a bunch of different directions and a lot of eyes are on you. Good luck and just get pushed out there and try to find things to sustain the body while the mind searches for answers and likeminded people to hang with in order to compare idea so you don't feel like you're crazy.

Speaker 6:          01:39:27       You don't feel like you're the only person out there. On the beach howling at the moon saying, what the fuck is this? Somebody please make sense of this shit. Somebody is there anybody out there in the Internet now you can send that fucking message in a bottle and someone answers, dude right here, WTF? What the fuck? What's going on? What's happening? And everybody gets together and that's the hive mind. That's how the mind really thickens. That's how things really start getting connected to happening. Right now. It's only we're only dealing with a two decade old invention. Two decades is a fucking a fraction of the time it takes for your eyes to close,

Speaker 12:         01:40:08       but how about when? Not only does it get a grip of people being like, what the fuck? How about, how about when it brings groups of people into the streets and overthrows governments like in Egypt. I mean it doesn't just stop with

Speaker 6:          01:40:22       how about the UK? One of the things that we're trying to do, they want to shut down twitter and facebook over there because that's how people were communicating this bart thing that happened at San Francisco to shut down the fucking cell phones. They didn't want people organizing. Yeah, it's crazy, man. I like that kind of shit is like, listen man, you can't do that. You can't. You're not allowed to shut off the phones. What if someone's fucking mother was dying? What if someone got hit by a car but you couldn't call fucking ambulance because you can't use your phone because you assholes are afraid of criticism because you assholes are afraid of people yelling and screaming and telling you that you fucked up so you cut off the phone lines. You should go to jail. You should go to jail. If you shut off the phones in America in 2011 to avoid a protest, fuck you. That's ridiculous for you to say that you want to maintain order so badly, you will cut off communication between everyone. Tax payers with good people that have done no wrong without a single spot on their record. You deny them use of the phone to blanketly. Fuck you.

Speaker 12:         01:41:31       You know what they said? What? Humans have American, have a right to free speech, but they also have a right to get to where they want to go on time.

Speaker 6:          01:41:39       Yeah. Well, how about if someone's dying suit?

Speaker 12:         01:41:42       No, I think it's the worst. I think it's a, it's fucking. So it's, to me it's scary. It's terrifying, terrifying, terrifying. It's scary because it's like,

Speaker 6:          01:41:50       which you're supposed to do is you're going to have to hire more cops, stupid. And you gonna have to, you know, keep peace in a, in a very respectful manner. And you know, there's a, there's a, there's a whole fucking bad history which we cops and people up there, man. And you know, I'm not saying that the cops are 100 percent in the wrong, but there's been some shit they did. That's crazy. Like the cop that shot the guy because he thought it was tasering him instead he shot them and it's all on video. I mean look what the fuck, man. There's been a lot of nonsense like that. And just when you shut the fucking phones off and keep people from protesting, people just got to go, what, what, what the fuck are you doing? And who the fuck are you?

Speaker 12:         01:42:26       That's why it's so incredible what anonymous did by creating a protest that got broadcast nationally to every internationally people saw that shit. And, and if they hadn't have done that, if they'd been content with just having conversations about it, it wouldn't have escalated to the level that it is escalated to. And a lot of those guys got arrested. Like they put freedom of information in front of their own freedom. That is heroic. That's bad ass. That's what I'm talking about. I'm saying at some point you people have got to like stand up because if you don't. If no one had stood up, no one had done that. If there'd been no protests, if Bart didn't know that every time they tried to shut the fucking phone lines down, they're gonna get swarmed. Was the, what was the protest over, do you know? I don't know that it was. They were putting the, the anonymous protest was after another protest that happened. And I do not know why the first protest happened. I just know they shut the fuck up.

Speaker 6:          01:43:24       Did it have to do with that guy who was murdered? I think that the guys getting out of jail a column, maybe I might be completely different. That's what I thought the whole thing was about the time. It's just so satisfying the world. And when you think about that, someone lost their life because of something so fucking stupid. And then the guy who did it, the one fucking stupid mistake, his life is fucked forever too. Yeah. He's got to deal with that for the rest. I mean, can you imagine what it is? How stupid you must feel to make that mistake. You're so panicked. You thought you had your Taser, but you had your gun and you shot the guy.

Speaker 12:         01:44:02       That weight of that. Think of the weight of that. I always think about that, the weight, because it's like when you fuck over a friend or if you do something stupid, eventually you can say, I'm sorry. That was stupid. You can apologize and you can get it off your chest when you kill somebody. You can't do it. You can apologize. Someone back to live. There's nothing you can do. You can say you're sorry to their family, but that's not going to bring the person back. It's so terrible.

Speaker 6:          01:44:29       Yeah, it's pretty crazy idea. We're so connected to each other. What? You lose someone in your life so, so painful. The idea that other people can take people away from people. That's like the ultimate attack on them. So strange because we all know are temporary. We all know we're going to die. We just don't want to right now. I'm not ready yet. Now I'm moving too much fun. I'm enjoying this. I'm just. I'm just getting this thing mastered. I'm just getting it figured out. I know how to enjoy it. Now. I figured it out. I figured out how to enjoy. Don't let me die yet. No, not yet.

Speaker 12:         01:45:05       Sorry. Mr Rogen. We've got to move you onto the next experiment. You can't stay here. That's, you know, that's like. Maybe that's all it is. It's like when they give like the planet of the Apes, you know when they have that, the spoiler alert, your fingers in your ears don't do it. It's not that bad. I can talk about the tests that they did. Right. Can I talk about it?

Speaker 6:          01:45:23       Talk about the plot is probably not smart. That's rude.

Speaker 12:         01:45:26       Okay. So forget planet of the apes. But sometimes the kids you give them like intelligence tests where they have to like do like certain things you know and, and imagine if that's what this whole thing is, some kind of alien intelligence tests where after you solve the puzzle, you get moved along and the way it looks when you get moved along is you, you're gone day taking a bullet in the chest or your, you know, your, some, you're someone who just like maybe you just have a heart attack. Like sometimes I've thought I wonder if there's like a thought you can have or a place you can get to where you just get it to the point where you don't have to stick around here. Like they say that some yogis through meditation have just like meditated and meditated and they can willfully just leave their body. They call it dropping your body. They don't call it death dropping your body.

Speaker 6:          01:46:17       I wouldn't. I wouldn't put that past the realm of possibility. Have you considered the fact that your brain, we know produces a bunch of different psychedelic chemicals? Who's to say that it's not some way to trigger those are not the way it is. Some way to stimulate those, but putting yourself into a frequency through meditation where you force the brain to accept a certain vibe, a certain just a certain frequency, and in doing so you can actually force your brain into producing certain chemicals and then you'd fucking blast off in the brain. Makes psychedelics fact, fact. The human

Speaker 5:          01:46:49       body makes psychedelics fact. We know it does. It makes a bunch of things that affect your behavior. It makes adrenaline, makes dopamine, Serotonin, so all these different things that oxytocin. There's all sorts of things that stimulate you, affect you, and we know it makes all the crazy chemicals that exist, that create the dream state kind of been taking this Fuckin Alpha brain shit and having the nuttiest dreams. Man and I had a werewolf, gorilla sex dream. It was the strangest fucking dream of all time. It was so bizarre because it was so stupid, but so real and so easy to recall this, these, these Alpha brain things. Man. One of the things that a bunch of people tweeted me about this too, that when you, uh, when you take them and have dreams for whatever reason, you're fucking, you remember your dreams, you know, and um, this dream was so stupid.

Speaker 5:          01:47:40       It was a gorilla and he was right behind like a bulging and breaking piece of wallboard. You know, that white plaster. And I had a squirt the, uh, the, the, the, the fucking stuff to put them to sleep through it. I couldn't go and get to him that I had to run away and hide. And he ran into a werewolf and they fucking fought and then started sucking each other's cocks. Was the most ridiculous dream ever. I'm not reasonable. I Dunno what the fuck it means, but there's Werewolf was on top sucking this gorillas cock and there were like 69 and I was like, what kind? I've never had a dream like that before. Where I was. He looked into dream dictionary doesn't exist. You are Joe Rogan. Yeah, it was. It was so crazy. It was like going from an absolute terror and fear like there was these, these gorillas were these giant silver backs and they were right behind this thin piece of wallboard and I had to inject them with this, the sedative.

Speaker 5:          01:48:38       I had to get them with it and I couldn't quite get to them and I pulled it out and he came through the wall and I ran as I ran out and then he runs into the little girl. It was just, it went from 69 became completely ridiculous. Not only that, but the way they looked became completely ridiculous. They went from being like a terrifying looking silver back gorilla to some sort of curious George halfway into, you know, goofy looking like smiling gorilla, getting his dick sucked by a Werewolf, you know? It became completely cartoonish. It was so strange. I was like, I can't even wrap my head around how anybody would try to describe, how are you going to tell me what's going on in my head? That's how are you going to, to when it, everything became a big gay joke. It's like you're running from, you're running from a terrifying superior physical specimen in a giant silver back gorilla that you're trying to sedate through a wall with a needle and then you run away and then a werewolf turns a corner and smashes into the grill and then they start blowing each other the fuck man.

Speaker 5:          01:49:44       Better get. Do you do believe in those dream books

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       that's not in there? I don't believe it. That's in a dream book. I'll and I'll tell you what,

Speaker 1:          01:49:53       God, I'm fucking straight as they come. That's not, that's not what this is about. Um, I am just a not responsible for a lot of the thoughts that spin around in my imagination. Sometimes. I really don't believe I am. I think, I mean, it's not that I was thinking that this was a real thing. It was like my brain just created the stupidest idea for them

Speaker 4:          01:50:13       movie in the middle of a horrifying scenario scenario. Like now, did you join into the, into the monkeys at all? Did you start having sex with them or trying to get away? I was trying to get away and they were just blowing each other. Oh wait, no escape. Yeah, yeah. They started blowing each other and then I said, okay, I can get outta here. But it became like cartoon. Should you walk away slow like watching the whole time here. I tiptoed so it didn't shock them, you know, I feel like if you move too fast they can't help but chase, you

Speaker 1:          01:50:45       roll a ball of yarn past a kitten, they run after it. They can't help themselves. It's just instinctual. They say that's what also happens with bikers, mountain bikers and mountain lions. Sometimes mountain lions is see them moving fast and they literally can't help themselves. They just chase after him. Right? So you want to make sure you don't do that. So I walked away real slow and they were blowing each other. So there you go. You guys. There's a survival tip. Yeah. If you ever come upon a werewolf allowing a gorilla gorilla sucking each other's cocks. Same. Yeah. What the fuck is that? Good luck, Freud. Good luck. Disecting that memory or that, uh, that idea. But the weird thing is that it was so vivid. These pills, for whatever reason, give you these incredibly vivid dreams. What, um, what's in them? Good question. I should probably know, right? Telling everybody to take them. It's a supposedly a everything. There's, there's a on on it.com, o n n I t dangerous, or Aubrey as he says. Would you say Angel Eyes?

Speaker 4:          01:51:40       Yeah. People keep on saying there's Angel Angel Eyes. What does that mean? It is that stuff that you give to dogs. So when they, they tear it makes it, you know, when dog cries, it gets black underneath their eyes. Angel Eyes is something that you put in their food when they eat, so it doesn't. It takes that away and people on online is like, does it have angel was.

Speaker 1:          01:52:00       I've never knew that there was something like people are going to serve with their dogs tiers.

Speaker 4:          01:52:04       Yeah. When you get like a white dog and it's really spraying that yellow shit out. Looks like, but what the fuck are you doing to the dog? What does that mean? They're protein. It's like a too much zinc or something weird like that. So it's just sort of holistic. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Where the fuck are we talking about before? Angel eyes are telling him about it. 60 nine werewolf gorilla did do other. Begin from that to Angel Eyes. You're talking about the brain stuff, the pills, the brain pills. Who knows what they're doing to us. Your. Yeah. Your sales pitch for the pills. I think we got to work on it a little bit. Working on it.

Speaker 1:          01:52:39       No, I'm not selling it. This is what I'm telling you this. This is what I've decided to do. I'm just going to be totally honest with how I feel them.

Speaker 10:         01:52:46       That's my. I'm going to give my pr. I'm not a doctor. Obviously, if you're listening to any medical advice I'd give you. You're a silly person. There's plenty of valid sources on the Internet, but I am a person with an objective experience and what I'll do is I'll take these fucking pills and I'll tell you what I feel like and what I feel like right now is I feel like they make. My mind feels clearer and clearer is a very subjective term obviously, but I feel like I have more energy, but it doesn't feel like a run on sort of a spiky caffeine energy. It feels like it. I hate the word crisp and cleaner, but that's for lack of better word. Enough of energy. Yeah. It does something good, man. I, I enjoy it and it gives me very memorable dreams. Not all of them involving gorillas and wearable.

Speaker 10:         01:53:30       If some of them been weird. People dreams have some science fiction dreams. You know, I've had some. I've had some crazy ones. I had this crazy dream about a world with a thousand Nikola Tesla's that instead of just one super genius oddball, crazy man like tesla, this, it was like a subsect of the species and it was like a thousand of them and they just in a matter of a few years time had these giant metal floating ships all throughout cities and everything was run through wireless electricity and this was me somehow or another in the 19 fifties, this 1000 teslas had moved society so rapidly before anybody could even control it because they were so far advanced. It was like a thousand of them altogether creating all this shit. And in the 19 fifties there was flying ships and you know, there was a type of electronic connectivity that was very similar to the way we're doing it now, but different.

Speaker 10:         01:54:29       It was just everyone could talk to people from these handsets that we're all throughout the city. Like there were, there were, there were, you know, everyone was congested at this one place and you could move to any handset and constantly be contacting people. It's very trippy, man. It was really weird because it was like 19 fifties aesthetic, like the way people dress and you know, a man going to work with a leather briefcase and you know, and, and, and even like the certain type of hats, they would wear it with their glasses on. Father knows best for me. Mother is flying metal ships and no electricity in the air. Now Tesla wanted to broadcast electricity. He wanted it to be like, well, radio signals and have it just fly through the air. But then anybody could just like radio, just all you need is a receiver to take it. There was no fucking money in that.

Speaker 12:         01:55:14       Yeah, that's right. Yeah. He had a lot of shit that he invented that, that, you know, they took away his trunks that all his writing. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:55:23       It's Kinda fascinating. Fascinating dude. But in this crazy dream, the dream like almost had a title of a thousand Teslas has it. There was all these little crazy looking dudes, eccentric looking super geniuses running around all together. Like if I was creating all this nutty shit and no one could keep up with what the effects, it was just, it was nothing like the slower pace that we've had to endure over, you know, and really, and you think about an extra half of a century and shit, it's really not that much time ever to have all this, uh, new technology together. But if at all burst together in the 19 fifties, if we had every, all the access to, to all the different disciplines that we have today, if we have them in the 19 fifties, if there was really like that kind of an evolutionary growth like immediately from 1900 dash, 1950, that'd be incredible. That'd be so fascinating. If in a lifetime we go from 1900 to us right now or advance or even more advanced in 50 years.

Speaker 12:         01:56:16       Yeah. Like if the singularity happens in the fifties.

Speaker 10:         01:56:19       Exactly. Do you believe in the multiverse stuff? I'm stupid. I'm too stupid to argue about it. I read, um, some new thing about, I forget what it was that made them believe that some sort of a, some sort of sound, something vibration. What was the, the latest. There's some latest evidence of a multiverse. What do you know, what it is now on the Internet?

Speaker 12:         01:56:44       It's all still. What if though I. that's the only bad thing about the whole thing. We're never going to probably find out in our lifetime. I don't know, man. If you look back, if you want to see how much we've advanced, just go back like we were talking about earlier and check out the medical idea. People have this scientific ideas. People at here it is right here.

Speaker 10:         01:57:02       First observational test of the multiverse. The theory that our universe is contained inside a bubble and that bubble, that multiple alternate universes exist inside their own bubbles making up the multiverse is for the first time being tested by physicists to research papers published in physical review letters and physical review. D are the first detail how to search for signatures of other universes. Physicists are now searching for disliked patterns in the cosmic microwave. Background, relic, heat radiation leftover from the Big Bang, which could provide telltale evidence of collisions between other universes in our own whoa. Collisions, evidence of collisions of universes. What the fuck dude collisions. That's the alternative concept to the Big Bang as well. The idea that our universe, whether it's in a bubble like the multiverse or the people that proposed membranes, they proposed that the brains collide at certain points and that creates like a recycling of the of the world.

Speaker 10:         01:58:12       We just can't wrap our head around something that's that far or that long, that much longer, uh, a period of existence than our own life. The idea of this cycle that's billions and billions of years. We are so important in our own lives that the idea that that's how small apart we play for real. I'm going to exist for 80 years inside some weird biological body and some crazy process that happens every 16, $17, billion years. These things collide with each other and everything starts completely from new. No planets, man, no nothing. Just particles and gas and heat and nuclear explosions and fucking mass connects all these different objects together. And they slowly formed planets and then live grows on them, and then life becomes complex. Life becomes intelligent, self-aware, life creates technology, goes to war, blows up the fucking universe, and then they collide again and more collide all around. And it's a constant cycle of you society, life. Everything in the universe, complexity gets to a certain peak and then just they just hit each other.

Speaker 12:         01:59:22       Maybe it's not that much time in between each collision. Maybe it's not. Maybe a genius thought are really great idea when people have like super great ideas, maybe that's a collision, a collision that's happened, maybe like maybe, uh, maybe, maybe it happens on the micro scale and not just on the macro scale. It's like perhaps there's like super tiny universe is that bubble again and again, stars and like manifest in the form of somebody who came up with the theory of relativity or some kind of Gullah culture shaping idea like communism or something like that. Maybe that every great idea is just a projection of the multiverse coming through people and manifesting here is massive global change and maybe we're getting hit by more of them now like a media or swarm of these multi. These other universes bumping into ours. Falcon Mckenna wrote this awesome, weird story.

Speaker 12:         02:00:20       Did you ever read this thing? He talked about how it is right around when Christianity started, the universe ripped into a multiverse and there's another advanced dimension right next to ours that's concerned over the fact that we have nuclear weapons, but like normally we can be ignored, but the fact we have nuclear weapons kind of like makes things in multiverse is next to us that are aware of is worried, but he wrote it not like it was really wrote it in this strange way. Like I couldn't tell if he was trying to write a metaphor or something. I just don't want to find it is fucking cool, but this tesla thing you're talking about. It's so funny because you have to think, okay, well I guess my brain just completely manufactured this alternate reality or super intelligent people that invented all these things. That's like one version of it or the other version which a lot of I think shamans talk about his idea of the spirit world where that moment your astral body went to some alternate dimension and sow one possibility of the way our universe could have turned out and then came back here and now you're broadcasting that.

Speaker 12:         02:01:27       Say as many people as listening, listen to the show. You're a leak of some weird, some weird coordinate of the multiverse is coming through you now as you talk about this thing that's like it's a dream. Maybe there's some fucking part of the multiverse where where will 69 gorillas stay the fuck away

Speaker 5:          02:01:48       away from there. It just. To me it was almost like a little message that everything is preposterous. Do you take. Do you ever stop and wonder how much

Speaker 2:          02:02:01       of

Speaker 5:          02:02:02       your life, how much of the things that you go through are real and how much of it may be some sort of a background noise going on in this weird play that you're creating for yourself to your imagination has put forth and then Sunday you're going to understand it all, but right now it's all the people that are in front of you or the bit players and you're supposed to be trying to figure this thing out as you move along. All that stuff that's going on in the background car accidents

Speaker 12:         02:02:28       or seems like there's so many pieces going together to like too to too many times. I'm like, that's just weird that that just happened like that. You know, like it just seems like it's just

Speaker 5:          02:02:38       manifesting things in your own mind. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not, it's not a fault. It's not foolproof. You know? It's not like he could prove it. Right, but there's something going on.

Speaker 5:          02:02:48       Yeah, I think it is. I think there, there there's something to the idea that we're like, when you know someone's going to call you and then you pick up the phone and it's them. That's just weird. There's something to that. I don't know what it is. I'm not, but I don't buy that. It's just coincidence. It may be coincidence sometimes, but I've had sharp moments where I thought of somebody and I looked at the phone. It started ringing and it was like sharp moments. Like I don't know what that is. I don't know what it is. You could say that. It's just luck in anticipation of meeting each other. You know that I was hoping that person called me, but not even man. Sometimes you don't even think about that person for a long time. Then all sudden you think about them like, wow, I haven't talked to him in fucking 10 years, and then he leaves you an email and you're like, what is that? What is

Speaker 12:         02:03:38       it just happened to me? Dude, I just on the lab under our. I just did. My friend Brendan Walsh came in and we both go to the same medicinal marijuana dispensary and we're both talking about how awesome it is and the people that work there really fucking cool and so I'm like, you know what, I'm going to do a commercial for this dispensary. Like I want to do like a all the way commercial should be. I'm not getting paid. They don't even know who I am. I'm just going to do this commercial because they're cool people and a cool fucking place. So I, I did like little, like there's a character on a Webinar or a teacup pig is basically little Hobo. I, I did this stupid commercial for them. The next day I went in there to get my medicine and I walked in and the guy's like, Hey, I look at this, look at this, and he just pulled up on the computer, the lavender, our episode where I did the advertisement. Now what the fuck are the odds that the odds of that are pretty God damn slim. I mean, it's. I think the odds that that guy would even hear it are pretty slim. But if you consider the idea of me coming there at the exact time, you just pull it up on the computer.

Speaker 5:          02:04:43       Dude, I don't think you have any idea how many people listened to you on this podcast. I bet probably was a big pothead podcast fan and he probably listens to this one or listens to yours and he knew exactly who the fuck you were and he, he seen you online because he thought you were hilarious. When I find out that about a comedian of someone that I think is funny or a musician or some new music like I got, I just got into Queens, queens of the Stone Age, every slab and looking up on them and reading different articles about them and downloaded a couple of their cds. It's great stuff. But when you then you all of a sudden you know what that person looks like if you recognize them. So if this guy was like a lavender, our

Speaker 12:         02:05:22       fan wasn't. His friend had told him about it. I'm just saying that weird temporal coincidence of me. I even tried to pee on your parade. The parade. I want it to be the voice of logic of all. I mean this was, but I more people listen to your show and the lavender are for one too.

Speaker 5:          02:05:42       You got to get rid of that broad.

Speaker 12:         02:05:44       Get outta here. Holy Shit. I was like, man, don't go down

Speaker 5:          02:05:54       please. Man. People love those kinds of shows. Jay Moore does it with his girl and everybody. There was an article on our website about, um, uh, uh, what's his face? Who the fuck does it with his girl, uh, Gilbert, Gilbert, Gilbert, Jesus Christ, Bill Burr and his girlfriend would get into arguments and he doesn't want his Monday morning podcast. There was a whole thread about how they love it when bill burrs girlfriend comes on because it's fun.

Speaker 12:         02:06:18       It's a, it's A. I think that's some of the funniest moments when we start arguing. Kevin Smith,

Speaker 5:          02:06:22       his wife. That was an interesting one. It's, it's, you know, it's a different dynamic man. You know, husband and wives have weird dynamics. Men and women. We're dynamics, you know, uh, doing yours. I love doing your podcast. It was fun. It was fun seeing you in this different environment, you know, because whenever you and I do a podcast, we do it over here, but doing it over there, it was cool to see, you know, you and her have this real cute little banter thing going back and forth and we're all sitting in this thing together and you have to stop every 20 minutes because it's a, it's about to crash your hard drive. Like it's like so totally dunk. It's like, oh, this is awesome. It's awesome. Hold on guys. I got to say this, I got to say this. This is gold. Hold up. So every 20 minutes

Speaker 12:         02:07:02       saving it on his fucking hear that sound effect. We fixed it, we fixed it. You know what I like.

Speaker 5:          02:07:08       This is what I really liked about it. She and you are very different, but she lets you be you. She's not trying to change you and you're such an odd guy. Dunkin and I've, you know, we've had, you know, you've had situations in the past where girls did kind of get that, that was good and they wanted to turn you into something else. Like do you remember the time when you were thinking about quitting comedy and you're going to go back to school?

Speaker 12:         02:07:31       Yeah, because every time I get on the show, you'll remind me and everyone about it. It was.

Speaker 5:          02:07:36       It was a brilliant moment. Yeah, it was a beautiful moment. It was. It was a moment, which I don't mind by the way. I was joking. I don't know. I know. I know, but who were you dating? Sigourney weaver. Those moments when you realize that someone is morphing you and then you are trying to conform to what they like because you don't want them to leave you. Those are creepy fucking weird moments that that's terrible or scary moments.

Speaker 12:         02:07:59       Those are scary fucking moments because. Because. Well they are all. You know what they are. It's an illusion of being scary because you know, I mean, well, no, it isn't. I mean for some people, what happens if you put a baby inside one of those people? What happens if like, yes, that's. Then then you're connected forever. You're chained to a person who's this satisfied with you as a human, but here's the thing. They're being with someone for awhile, you're, you're going to watch people go through phases and they're going to be some phases that people are in it maybe you're not so cool with, you know what I mean? And you have to differentiate between is this person or am I dissatisfied with some core aspect of this human or are they just in a weird spot right now? And I got to see, you know what I mean? It's, it's tricky because

Speaker 5:          02:08:45       you and your chick or unusual in that you're both in the same line of business and you work together and you still get along. Yeah. How the fuck does that happen? Um,

Speaker 12:         02:08:57       doesn't always happen. It doesn't always happen. We don't always get along. We're not in a, we have a great relationship. But if you think that. I mean,

Speaker 5:          02:09:06       relationships aren't idyllic, you know what I mean? But what is it like, like you're mean and you open for her, right? Yes. Well that's kind of your feature for multiple sale,

Speaker 12:         02:09:18       right? I'll open for whatever. I do open a lot of shit. Open car doors for open. Everything is open fucking cans. What I'm trying to say, she's a good comic too. She's a great comic and she's fucking disciplined and really funny. And when we work together we are synergy creates a lot of funny shit and, and I'm, and I make her laugh and she's got one of the greatest lines I've ever heard. And so that keeps me wanting to be funny around her and instead of it like her rejecting me being funny. She embraces it. And so then you've got girls reject you being funny. Uh, I would, I wouldn't say like reject me being funny, but I think it's more of a, it's more with her. Is it a conformity thing? Like they wanted you to like, I know it's always crazy power, man.

Speaker 12:         02:10:04       It's not a conformity thing. It's like you're either in a relationship with somebody where you can create a symbiosis and merge your power together and you both want each other to be successful or you're in a situation with someone where somebody wants to be on top. Somebody wants to be at. Someone wants to be literally on top in every single way. And so if you're in a relationship where somebody is trying to repress your creativity out of fear, then as a human being, you have to, you have to get out of that relationship. But it's not that easy. You're in love with somebody.

Speaker 6:          02:10:34       What do you. What do you mean by what you were just saying? Someone that always wants to be on top, on top,

Speaker 7:          02:10:41       on top of the game, on, on top of you in every way. Dominant. The dominant one. The if, if you're with someone who you've had that man. Oh yeah, I would say you did want to hear

Speaker 6:          02:10:52       that one's full on someone just constantly fucking with you. Constantly.

Speaker 7:          02:10:59       Time for that. Really, I think. I think the important thing to realize that she has a vagina is not a life of hell, but it's true. They're fucking shades of this that we're talking about. There's shades of this and, and I, and the reason it's kind of a common, you know, it's a common thing when you see in a sitcom or a movie. The theme of that got yes, dear. Whatever she wants is what goes. It's because we're talking about a some form of interaction that happens between the masculine and feminine

Speaker 6:          02:11:32       energies. Will, you don't, it's really interesting. Um, you, you've grown more. It's true. You've grown more as a person. I mean, you, you've always been a guy who's really pretty introspective and kind of brutally honest about yourself, pro or con. But when you're in a steady relationship, I always feel like, especially like right now, like you're in a healthy one, you, you're in a, you're in a way different place creatively. Like you're able to express yourself without the burden of. There's a lot of psychological fucking warfare that goes on and constantly bad relationships that really clouds up the mind. And when you're in a healthy relationship, you know, like you are, it allows you to think about things much clearer. Your ability to describe reality just over the past few years, you've gotten so much better at it. Man, you're, you're writing's gotten better. Your comedies gotten better. You've always been a super smart dude, but I think that when, when you're in a position where you, you find someone who doesn't try to fucking change who you are is so important. So worst thing in the world, is he one of your friends stuck in some situation where someone's trying to get him to be something that he's not right, not encourage them to do what he wants to do, but to get them to. You're never going to make it as a comedian. Just give this up.

Speaker 7:          02:12:54       Yeah. The thing about you can write books. Yeah. I get encouraged like that. Yeah. It's a very cool relationship because the income I get encouraged to go on stage more. You got to go on stage more. You gotta go up all the time. You gotta work harder. Why you get onstage? Do you had to do standup? Go on the road, get a headlining sets, like a really good situation for sure. Yeah, but you know, if

Speaker 6:          02:13:16       she was married to some square dude who's like, you know, fucking accountant or something like that. It's like, you know her interests and needs and weirdness and probably be too much for him. You know what I mean? It's like you guys meet at the perfect time, your weirdness in your, your creativity.

Speaker 5:          02:13:32       She understands it. She gets it. She gets what you're doing. She gets that this is a gonna result in you killing on stage. Whereas someone who doesn't see you as being successful enough things that they can fix you and mold you and turn you into something respectable. They can bring it parties. Oh, this is my boyfriend Duncan. He's a professor at Cornell. What do you teach? Uh, you know, mostly ancient history, but a philosophy. Can I get you another tree, you know, and you got those suede patches on your elbows and you're just thinking about telling a great suck my cock joke and killing in front of a large crowd at the comedy store on a Friday night, a nice 10:00 spot. You're crushing you thinking about that while you're hanging out with some dildos, some stupid house where they eat French cheese had come in their pants. Wow. The second part.

Speaker 5:          02:14:26       And then you watch two monkeys, fuck, I knew a dude from France and him and his wife became friends with them and they had me over for some weird dish that they have with non pasteurized cheeses and he was like really adamant about that, that when they homogenized and pasteurized cheese in America fucks up the flavor. So he has to sneak this shit over. Illegal cheese. Yeah. He actually sneaks it over. Wow. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He puts it in some, a container that says it's pasteurizer modular as they have people that will do it for them because it's stinks. It was kind of was bacteria in it, you know, but it's so good. And that's what. I'm sorry. But that's what blue cheese is. You look at those crumbles. The blue cheese, the blue part. That's like fun.

Speaker 3:          02:15:05       Can Mold. Why would it be illegal though? Just because it's considered like a poison or something?

Speaker 5:          02:15:09       Good question. Um, I think it's a really good question. I think just for public health concerns, when you, uh, when you like raw milk, it's like real dangerous. You can only keep it for a certain amount of time. Now, how long is it good. For me, regular milk is good for like a month. Raw milk can be good for more than like seven or nine days or something like that. I would imagine. And you know, people can get sick, you know? I think that's, that's some of the theory behind it is that it when you homogenize things pasteurized and you can pick them, keep them on the shelf longer, but that's also how you apparently cooked the enzymes. That's one of the reasons why people have lactose intolerance, but some people with lactose intolerance can actually drink raw milk and not have any problems with it. Weird. Yeah. But raw milk tastes delicious dude. Raw whole milk. It's like really? It tastes really good. Like with cookies. Oh it's the shit. It's so like rich and creamy and you know, it seems so alive when you drink it as opposed to like, you know when you drink regular, homogenized, pasteurized milk. This is milk, body, dead milk, water, Whitewater thing. It's not so weird but comes from a cow.

Speaker 3:          02:16:16       This cheese that I got in Paris, God, you sound like a jerk when you talk like this. You sound like such a jerk. But this cheese I had, it was like talk. It was not, it was not just like a little bit of mold. Like you'll get cheesy and you'll see the green stuff. It was like flourishing more like when you leave, like just rising above the cheese, just like blowing with mold and it was so good. You just ate the whole diarrhea or weird feelings. I don't even want to talk about. Really. I don't even want to talk about what I did do at June. Why would you even eat that? You made so you had all this delicious food and you got mad diarrhea and you're trying to get us to eat it. It wasn't diarrhea. It was something worse for it. Did you do your girl get it to.

Speaker 3:          02:17:03       No, I don't think so. Did she eat the same stuff you ate? Yeah. If she got it, she didn't tell me. Well good. That's good. That's nice. You can wear that like this is. I don't want to tell us. She's a good girl. I had it. It was very intense what it did to my stomach. Dude, there's nothing wrong with a good shit story. I always in this jazz club in Paris and I have, first of all, if you say that to the right girl you're in. Not when I followed up with this. Okay. I, I like what I did to the bathroom because like when I got up, after I'd finished, I'm trying to make this as not. When I was done with my shit and I looked back at the toilet, it was like a shit bazooka. Come Adam. It was like everything was just everything. Like I like, it was crazy where I, I panicked. I was like, Oh God, I gotta get Outta here. Get outta here. Someone walks in here now I might get arrested so much shit.

Speaker 3:          02:18:06       They would arrest you for oversharing. Look him in the clinic. Yeah. Girls share poop. A pictures with each other. It's just like guys don't really. They take pictures of their poo, I would imagine. Yeah. Yeah. This is a world. Women should be allowed. The freedom of shock. Shocking people with a giant poops. I love him. I wish I could put them online. I wish I could put my pictures online. You can fuck Outta here. Nothing stopping you. Just intelligence. Hey, you're going to be in a New Orleans to see your shit man. I don't want to get upset when. When I, when I see people's Shit. I don't know. I'm going to see it. Yeah, I'm going to be in New Orleans. Yeah. You got to check out this restaurant in New Orleans. It's, it's crazy. It's called oceans. Uh, when I tell you right now, I just started thinking about those catacombs. Ocean, ocean,

Speaker 4:          02:18:54       ocean, restaurant, ocean. It. I just saw the show on the woman CEO owns it. Tried to trick me. Is it really, you know, they were on that show I was talking about once a kitchen nightmares and you got to watch a season for it. Last episode of season four, but the guy on there is and almost tried to beat up, uh, the chef and then the, the, the kitchen man or the head chef had like some seizure thing going on with his face and they fired him on the show anyways. They're completely crazy. And so sometimes when people are on that show, I'll go on yelp to see if like their business is, you know, like in business and stuff like that or see what the reviews now or, and on their yelp right now it's like 110. We came with 110 people were trying to negotiate the bill, like manager went psycho called cops on and start throwing things screaming. And so you watch this episode and then you look at the yelp. This might be the craziest fucking place ever to go to. Wow. You got it. And then you look at their website and it's like a friendly website, like the happiest thing in the world. It's crazy. Have you ever been there before? New Orleans?

Speaker 1:          02:19:58       Yes. A long time ago I was there, uh, for a UFC. It was, who knows God when nobody knew what the UFC was back then. It was during the news radio days. Yeah. I don't remember much, man. We'll put on some fights and left when we were eight of the restaurant and people were saying, be careful. It's dangerous. That's what I kept hearing, Blah. Be careful. It's dangerous. People kept saying, be careful. It's dangerous. People get robbed. There's apparently a extraordinary amount of crime around New Orleans.

Speaker 3:          02:20:25       My Dad would take me to New Orleans. He'd go to a bar, he gave me like 60 bucks. I get fucking drunk and wander down the street and just take nitrous oxide heads. Hold on a second. How old are you? I think I was like 16, 15. I don't know what. That's what I used to do. 16 to. Yeah. I would go down the street and get. Because you could buy nitrous oxide balloons. So I, I, I, this is how bad kid I was. I spent all my money on a stripper and all these nitrous oxide balloons and some booze. So I know it money that was supposed to last for a couple of days that my dad had given me and then I told my dad I got mugged him. More money to spend on more nitrogen oxide. Is that crazy easy with corporation, half of their profit is just from people doing balloons. It's not crazy. Come on. Half the profit that. I mean that has to be. I used to bike, but you were reading something online. I'm sure man. I bet it's not even one percent. No Way. No, no. Sixteen year olds. Sixteen year olds do it. Out of 100. How many people do you know that make their own whipped cream? Yeah, exactly.

Speaker 3:          02:21:43       Awesome. Here's some homemade whipped cream. Everyone enjoy. I made this myself

Speaker 1:          02:21:51       couple of times and it is delicious. I don't. I think most people by the web stuff, don't get me wrong, but I've made it a couple times. It's pretty bad. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:21:59       Start. You got to get one of those blenders things was to whisks. They spend with each other and you get it a bowl and you add all the ingredients.

Speaker 1:          02:22:06       I've done it a couple times. It's pretty dope. Real whipped cream tastes better because you know, just. But you know, come on man, I ain't making this shit. I don't have the time for that.

Speaker 3:          02:22:18       But the stuff that's in the cans that doesn't taste as good, that doesn't care. She's good as trump. Like if you go to a real restaurant and get some real whipped cream

Speaker 1:          02:22:26       with strawberries.

Speaker 4:          02:22:27       When I see a can of whipped cream to this day, all I think about is how it comes to my mind when I see a can of whipped cream, when I will use to my. I had a friend in high school introduced me to whippets and after that I don't know if my parents thought I was trying to become a pastry chef. What the fuck they thought in Ohio, they sold it everywhere today. So at video stores whip it's like you come in and go buy a cracker, a balloon and the easy web at a video store. That's how popular was in Columbus.

Speaker 1:          02:22:59       So what is it? What is it? There's no whip cream in it. Done. It's just the air.

Speaker 4:          02:23:03       No, no, it's just the air that you use, the screw on the machines that would pump the air out, like to go, you learn how to do it, you don't shake it up, you buy it and you don't shake it out cause the gas rises to the top. So you just do it right off the top when you first do it. I'm talking about these low content canisters that you put in like a thing and they put it balloons talking about cracking the whip cream. I never did that. That's, that's, that seems more like wasting your task. So you're talking about just some nitrous oxide and sell. They sell easy whips. Where is that? What it's called? Nitrous oxide? No, two nitrogen, I think nitric oxide. But uh, but yeah, and they come in these little containers and they come you and by the case in each balloon then you have that metal cracker that looks kind of like something like a camping gear thing where you unscrew it and you put it in, close it, you put the balloon on one side and you crack it and it just fills a hole balloon. And then just take the blind. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:23:56       When I was a kid, I worked at a, one of those, um, ice cream place. It's called newports creamery. Newport Krumrie. They serve like cheeseburgers and shit. I was a cook for a little while and I got fucking horrible zits from that. That's the nastiest, cyber, but also a scooped ice cream and made ice cream Sundaes. And we would have to go replenish the, uh, the containers because it would make their own whipped cream. Yeah. So they had these giant fucking containers of nitrogen and everyone was a burnout. They would all go back there and get it. That's great. I only did it once. I didn't like it. That was my, I was scared of drugs days. That was all my martial arts.

Speaker 4:          02:24:27       You know what that sound is, don't you? Helicopter. Is that what happens when you do the, uh, the nitric triple starts going in waves. You hear the incident sounds like, whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa. Any truth to the fact that shit instantly makes you retarded in my. Yeah. It seems like it would fuck you up hardcore, but it's not as bad as as as dis cleaner. Like. Like I also add when I couldn't find a nitrogen, I would get disciplined for keyboards and stuff like that. That shit was way worse. I remember doing that and going, wow, this is horrible. Talking about anal nitrate. No, no, no. He's talking about the spray, the spray that you spray on keyboards, but I don't think they have any more. I think an air now this shit. Yeah, I see that. Oh No, not get high for us. Don't do that. Don't do it. Please. I'll just kill. I think that's just canned air. Yeah. I don't

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       think they'd make it anymore. Maybe not. I don't know. Century duster. Maybe. I kind of feel a little lightheaded. So what would that do? Duty. You did almost the same thing as nitrous, but it was grocer, like after you're done, you're like.

Speaker 3:          02:25:39       It seems like it's what you're experiencing is just oxygen being cut out of your bloodstream and your body almost

Speaker 1:          02:25:44       sky. Thinking about how many different ways people have sought to achieve altered states of consciousness, huffing paint themselves and jerking off while they were at lingerie. Yeah. How about that? I was watching the wonderful whites of West Virginia again on the plane and uh, one of the things that they were talking about was Jessica and how much gasoline he sniffed that he huffed so much gasoline. He could tell the difference between regular and high test. He doesn't have to look at the time. And he was talking about how you have gasoline. 10.

Speaker 3:          02:26:14       My strange addiction. No, what does that show on Tlc? And one of the episodes is a woman is addicted to sniffing gasoline. I wake up in the morning, sniffed out. She's like super hooked on it. So at her house is just filled with like old bottles of gas and she's, she spends all her money on gas. Oh my gosh. You just addicted to huffing gas. She loves it.

Speaker 1:          02:26:38       What the fuck is that? Is that psychological? It must be right?

Speaker 3:          02:26:41       Yeah. Because she's like, I get addicted. Yeah, you can. I mean Shit. Watch that episode. She's addicted or she craves it. Kinda like that disease where you crave and gas for 15 years. You're crazy.

Speaker 1:          02:26:52       Yeah, but what I'm saying is it become become physically addictive, like they think that amy winehouse, one of the speculations and amy winehouse died because she tried to quit alcohol cold Turkey, which can happen to people, but they know that happens. Council found medication in a room. Who knows, but you're right. It's very possible, but my point is that it is possible for that to happen. They know that that's a documentable occurrence. When people just quit, they need to wean yourself off the alcohol to stressing your system to just quit. You can kill you. That's amazing. Delirium, tremens, you're losing eight and you die and it's probably. It's probably several drugs and shit like that. Very addictive drugs that are like.

Speaker 3:          02:27:31       There's antidepressants that if you get off of yield, you'll get vertigo. Do have you seen the fucking commercials for that Game Deuce? Do something x than Walmart, like people cyborgs and it's a new video game. What the fuck, man, I watched that. It's an insane.

Speaker 1:          02:27:48       Those x x think that's how you say it, but yeah, that's a really old game man. And this is uh, the newest version of this really old concept that was like a really wicked game if I remember. It was made by the same guys that made Dika Catana. There was like this faction of ids software that broke off and there was this character, I think his name is Romero. And He, he started this company and they made two games. One of them had all this hype behind. It was called dikw autonomy and I thought it was pretty bad ass. It was great. Like death match style. He was like a quake. One Guy, he was with quake from the very beginning, but this other game they made this dose xx. I'm pretty sure it's the same company and this game was apparently awakened

Speaker 3:          02:28:30       dude fucking commercial. Have you seen the commercial with the cyborgs begging? Because they are, they're on this drug that you have to be honoring. Your body rejects the cybernetic part. So it's all these people with like Cyborg arms are like hookers with Cyborg legs begging because they have to pay for this medicine that you have to take to keep the, keep your excel falive and it's got its. I don't know what the game plays like is. This seems like just pure Cgi, like movie making. So I don't know what the game plan.

Speaker 1:          02:28:59       Is this a, is it an xbox game or a PC game? I don't know what game a dose X. Do you have these Weird d, u e u x or d? It's gotten checks in it. Yeah. If you look up like I was a computer game, but I think they also ported it over to something. It was a couple of years ago. Yeah, it was a long one. It's coming out this month. The first one came out a long time ago. I'm, I might be confused with linking it up with the people from China. Sorry, Uber nerds and Geeks. If I've steered you wrong. Do you remember dying autonomy? No. It's pretty dope. It was fun. It was. It disappointing to a lot of people because they thought that it was kind of a derivative, you know, a bunch of the games that existed, but to me it was pretty fucking fun.

Speaker 1:          02:29:43       Especially the death match was really fun. I don't need any other game. Then starcraft you don't like like fast twitch games like quake, starcraft's who's fast twitch, got all defensive, knows how you get. Did you notice two V, two Gold Lake? They got a little defensive, right? He did that game like starcraft, who's fast twitch minute, constant argument with everyone over starcraft. Two total dork was well for one playing video. Playing starcraft. Two is like they think I'm in. How much are you playing starcraft? Two. How often that? As much as a Korean, but not as much as the Chinaman. Three, three, three, three games a day. Three days. A lot of people right now saying that that's racist, but he's meanwhile ladies, gentlemen, listen to the context of using him. He's saying it's awesome. Yeah. Saying it's awesome. Yeah, but let's be honest. Asians love that game. They do. They do, right? Koreans love that game, right? Don't they have, like they, we've talked about the other things, it's the first time

Speaker 3:          02:30:43       I feel like I've been able to watch something akin to sports, really get excited about it because they just had this big tournament and they have like famous players and it was really cool to watch these two famous players, uh, compete against each other and knowing the game, having played it, seeing the crazy tricks they're using in the crazy control they have over so many variables. It's amazing to watch. And then it's so funny because I was thinking like athletes of the future are all going to be fat, fat and Pale because like they cut to these guys who just played this insane game that's like required so much brain power to control this. And since all they do is play computers, they're kind of emotionless. Like you cut to like a UFC fighter after each is knock someone out and it's like watching Julius Caesar March into a city that each is defeated.

Speaker 3:          02:31:32       It's fucking, you're watching glory. When you got cut to a starcraft two fighter player who's just won a game, it just kind of like one of them took his shirt off because underneath that he was wearing a shirt that was kind of insulting and he's like, eh. Then walked over and shook the guy's hand, Oh, good job. And that's it. But meanwhile they just did this crazy thing where they were controlled. I've never played the game of watched the best, uh, don't understand what's happening so I can appreciate it is the greatest game. It's like, it's like, it's like Sim city in space. It looks pretty crazy. It looks like you got to do a lot of different things and you're moving around a lot of different shit and you're setting things up all over the place. You're building the ideas, you're building up this economy by gathering resources and while you're building this economy, you're also constructing an army that has to be based on what your opponent's doing.

Speaker 3:          02:32:25       So you can't just do the same thing over and over again. You have to like scout what your opponent's doing and from seeing what they're doing. You understand what their strategy probably is and then you have to like create a perfect, a perfect offense to what they're doing while building a defense that works against the type of troops they're constructing because it might not always. You have to be completely reactive and you have to be able to do all of this. Well. It's like juggling. You're juggling all these crazy balls at once and you have to be able to do this and also instantaneously react to shit that you don't expect to happen. Isn't it crazy that the most satisfying game is a virtual representative of war? Yeah, totally. Pretty much all our. Yeah. Isn't that amazing? Well, that battlefield earth call of duty quake, Mario Brothers, unreal tournament.

Speaker 3:          02:33:16       The Mario or some sort of a futuristic or you know, ancient or either like world war two or something like the words fucking futuristic something. Yeah. What the fuck. You read that book war by Sebastian younger where there isn't a square. He does is he describes what that's like to be behind a fucking machine gun blasting people like he does this incredible description of it and the adrenaline that that creates is like amazing, but I'll tell you something else that creates adrenaline. When I do attend pool rush into my opponent's face and my fucking speed links in circle is base and devour it. Only she and then he has the audacity to text me and say that I was doing cheese moves. That's the greatest feeling ever. I see it and believe it and I think that if I got into it, I'd fucking love it too much and you would go there. Now I got a deleted it. I'm deleting it tomorrow. I think pool for me is a form of

Speaker 5:          02:34:18       like a moving meditation. When I'm running out, when I played pool, it's. I'm using my body as well and that's one of the things that I like about the most that I'm forcing my mind to control the exact amount of forest my body exerts on a piece of wood that impacts a ball that collides and into another ball and moves around. In order to do it right, I have to be in total tune with the amount of revolutions and causing this ball to turn over a nine foot table. I mean that's what I'm trying to control. So to get like into that like real groove of being like dead stroke where you really feel the movement. It really is like a form of meditation. So that's why I prefer it over video games. I had to pick my poison, I had to pick like what thing am I allowing myself to be addicted to and that I think I get more out of the pool than I did out of the video games. The Video Games was fun as fuck man, I love him to this day but I can't play you.

Speaker 4:          02:35:11       We played any of the connect games like there's a game right now called child of Eden. Have you fucking smoke some good weed or take some shrooms and stand in front of that game? You will fucking feel like you're doing virtual.

Speaker 5:          02:35:21       If I'm alone at home, I'll fire up gears a war for a goof. Just go on a fucking rampage because it's fun because it's just. The graphics are so dope, so wild. Seeing these fucking monsters they've created. I'll do that for fun on the big screen,

Speaker 3:          02:35:34       but yeah man, you got to moderate it. That's a province so fucking addictive and it's so easy to lose your mind to get lost in it

Speaker 5:          02:35:41       really just lost, but yet it's so fucking fun. And what? Who's to say that that fund is less real than the fun that you get actually out there playing basketball then? Oh, I'll say it. Yeah, me too. I think it's less real, but why? What if you're in tune and dominating you?

Speaker 3:          02:36:02       Why? Why? Because when I get done with an addictive session of world of warcraft and I've been playing, or I'm sorry, I used to be addicted to that. You started to starcraft two. When I get up after playing that game for like three or four hours straight and walk outside, I feel like I feel like I'm like a mentally disabled. I feel drained. My sleep sucks when I fucking, you know, uh, go to the gym or go jogging or do something like that. I feel great for the rest of the day. So video games are amazing and weirdly games that involve strategy, I think you can extrapolate some information from that that you can use in real life, but you got to do it in very small doses. It's like that. That seems like the responsibility of human beings. We've got this incredible brand new technology that's exploding in front of us. The discipline is not to reject it. Totally like those assholes. When you hear, I don't even have cell phone, it's not to reject it. The idea is that moderate at learn how to use it, like a tool. How do you do it? That's what every.

Speaker 4:          02:37:04       It's like when I said I was addicted to it, city of heroes, I used to always fantasize about jumping on from building the building just because I had been playing that video game so much and that was something I was doing repetitively

Speaker 3:          02:37:13       all day, all night. If you

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       dropped me off in the middle of a castle and they look like the scenes from quake one, I might start pretending I started talking like one of those quick cuts running down hallways with rocket launchers. Talking as usual. Yes, you're the best. You're the best man. You are those too much fun. Too Much to interesting and I'm going to enjoy all the taped phone conversations that the FBI will be tuning into myself. Ideas here,

Speaker 3:          02:37:48       ready to get bored. FBI conversations. My phone conversations suck. Have Fun with that.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be at the house of Blues and New Orleans and this, some of the get there early because some people are gonna have to stand up. Unfortunately there was no other way I could get a show there. There's another place you not get the standup states you will hate. It sucks. It sucks standing out. But I'll try to be as energetic as possible. And I instituted a policy when Brian and I went to see doug stanhope when we enjoyed the fuck out of Stan hope as always, but it wasn't fun to stand and watch a show. So I decided, you know, what I'm being brewed, asking people stand and watch my shows. Like from now on, I'm going to make sure that every show I do, people are seated, but there was no places in town, there was nothing I could do. There was like small places that were like 50 seats or um, you know, the House of Blues. So we're going to do the house of Blues and it's a rare seating and standing show. And that's September blonde, blue eyed girl Joe Rogan dot map for details.
