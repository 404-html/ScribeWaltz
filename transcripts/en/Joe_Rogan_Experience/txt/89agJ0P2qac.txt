Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Oh, here we go. You dirty bitches a certain point in time, I'm going to run out of dirty bitches. He can only call people dirty bitches so many before he'd come like a form of self parody, but it hasn't reached that point yet. I don't know. It'll, I'll know when it's there. You know? It's like that saying that was cool and then all of a sudden it's like you'll be sponsored by dove soap and then you won't be able to say it. And it's like, do you remember when that fuck you song came out? Yeah. See it green. Yeah. That song was fucking amazing when it came out. I mean that dude's like harmonious voice and you know saying, fuck you. You know what everybody really wants to say when you get your heart ripped out of your chest. I need to drive it around town. Another dude's driving around town with the girl you love and you're like, fuck you. But then somewhere along the line they talk to that dude in the change, in the words to forget, you know, that's just the radio part. It doesn't matter when they talked to him and to doing that, a little piece of the world died.

Speaker 2:          00:01:05       They, there's a song called

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       turned into a mall, a little piece of the world that not even the mall that Santa's set up at the mall where there's like the stupidest looking fake fucking snow on the ground and a little wooden fucking fake deer. Like don't even try and like, they're not really trying to trick you. They're like sort of represents Sanas workshop and this stupid dude pretending to be sick. That's what it became where it was raw and real. I'm like, fuck you. Yeah, fuck you. And he's like, I'm like, forget you what?

Speaker 2:          00:01:43       There's this song called thrift shop and they have to edit it just like that for the radio and but it, they edited so much stupid things like the edit honky out the word Honky, I'm offended by that word or that you smell like or it smells like r Kelly's pis. They edited that out. I wish we could elevate

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       Beta honky to the level of nigger. I wish we could have a word that was just as effective for a black person. Do you? So it would be an even war because of the way it is now. It's like us versus Yugoslavia or something. You know what I mean? Like some small country that doesn't have nuclear weapons, like the amount of power that the United States has, it's ridiculous for them to try to hurl their, their weaponry, our way. We'll verbally, that's what it is. White to black cause niggers, the ultimate nuclear weapon. It's like you're gonna fight. Someone's going to fight you. They will beat the fuck out of you for using that word. There's no white equivalent. It doesn't even exist. There's no white equivalent, no dehumanizing white equivalent. You know, like the, the, the idea of saying that word. It's like a, it dehumanizes people because the guy slavery connotations.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       A Mazda Gotti though, she said that is a deep inside NMH. Okay. Um, that's Adam. That's Adam Hunter ways. Gentlemen. This podcast has a couple of sponsors. She fucking get those out of the way. But we did an already, we already started a real podcast. Maybe it's better this way for us. Maybe, maybe you won't feel so bad that we talk about sponsors. Um, the only thing that will promise and, uh, always and if were incorrect about this, we'll, we'll let you know, um, is that anything that we get involved with, we believe is a legitimate con company that's trying to sell you good shit. We're not really interested in selling you something that's useless and we're not interested in selling you bad products. And I was having a conversation online today with someone who is upset about one of our sponsors and that that sponsor is ting.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       This guy's an idiot. But the con, the conversation was so dumb. Um, one of the things he was mad at is that it's on the sprint's network is a CDMA network and so he can't use the phone overseas. And I'm like, well that's just because it's, it's, it's a, it's a sprint network. That's what it is. It's an American network. Like there's only two American networks that are CDMA, that's Verizon and sprint. And you can't use those overseas. If you want to use Verizon overseas, you have to have a, um, a, a dual country card. You have to have a GSM chip inside the phone. So it has essentially as to two radios in it. So when you're overseas it kicks in the GSM one, it becomes a world phone.

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       Does he live overseas and or does he just travel in your lives overseas?

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       But he's in America I guess. And he was upset that he can't take it with them to his control over the roof. Fucking read it dude. If you're in a, you're a specialized situation for someone in America wants to like talk to people from America, you can call other countries from here. It's an awesome service. So be aware of that. There's I, there's only a few countries that still use CDMA, which is interesting because apparently CDMA is like the older technology, but it goes deeper into buildings apparently. That's why a lot of people that say they have Verizon and sprint, they, they will say that they get better coverage than people who have GSM. They have like at and. T. I find it, see him, at least in La. CDMA is definitely better for like not dropping calls. That's what I thought. You don't know about that. You're, you're okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:12       I have, well I have a 18 t iPhone five and then I have a Ipad, uh, Verizon, right. My Shit, at least their data network. I can never get fucking data on my fucking iPad. But then I look at my other phone, I'm like, oh, I couldn't make a hotspot on my at t and t networks on my Verizon iPad will work. Did you do that and was it more effective? Yeah. So you think that data is more effective than what region? It just seems like it just seems like where in La that it's the at and t is pretty solid in la now. Like you're in Texas, you're probably running around on cricket or something.

Speaker 1:          00:05:44       Seemed like it was, I used a t for a while and then when I switched over to Verizon I noticed a big difference. I thought it was much better. And I find that the same places that I could make calls with Verizon, I can pretty much make calls with sprint, seems to be, at least in the of the issue places that I had, you know, I, I, but as far as like a data networks, those data networks are those, those are funky man. Let's fucking online like four g laptop chips that you put in your, you know, those are a little wonky, like don't be trying to download anything big, you know, don't be thinking you're really online. You're on some weird thing that's like sorta online but it's not really online. And if you have you get frisky, it'll fucking kick you off. You know, look at this dude tried to download a movie, bitch the fuck out of here.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       There's disconnect you tingling and do that then not like that. They're nice. Uh, the, this is the criticism that this guy had said in a forum and then not to, you know, make his point like, uh, any, uh, bigger or grander than it was. But he, the idea was that Ting wasn't a non he evil company. I think it's forum posts said, stop saying that Ting is a non evil company, that they're evil for having CDMA and I guess maybe they, they do something with the, the operating system to sprint, do something. I know they put their own brand on it, but I think the whole thing that people love about android phones apparently is that if you really want to get crazy with them, you can jailbreak. I'm like super easy. He can route them or whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          00:07:18       I know somebody that just made their phone look like a exactly like it's a windows seven phone or eight phone. I'm like, ah, that's, that's horrible. Don't ever show that to me. I know you can do weird stuff with those androids. That's one of the things.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       Yeah, I die. I can't get involved with that. I can't be fucking around what it comes with. That's what I'm going to keep. I really don't have the time, but I do appreciate that it's available to people that want to do that kind of shit. If you're one of them. Hack sores type dudes that likes to get in your phone and fuck around.

Speaker 2:          00:07:51       I used to be like that. I think I'd be at an android user if I was 10 years ago. If you go to [inaudible] dot tv.com

Speaker 1:          00:07:55       you can save 25 bucks off of, uh, off of, uh, any phone or service or a credit device discount, 25 bucks. But prisons, you previously it was a $50 device discount and now you can apply the $25 total discount to either the service or towards a new device if you go to and the dot [inaudible] dot com but you said you can still find it for 50 bucks online.

Speaker 2:          00:08:21       Hey, check out this, just Google ting review and just go to the first line. And then they have a really nice write up of Ting and it's, you know, cuts through through it and there might be a thing that you can click on and be able to get $50 off.

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       Welcome to tinker with that promotion code from our partner. You get $50 off many devices and online that

Speaker 2:          00:08:41       am I apply this discount. Sorry. Rogan, I'm Outta here, dude. I got shafted for 25 bucks. They took a $25 gamble on me. I tell you the coolest thing though about thing is when you actually sign up for Ting and you actually get through the whole entire process, they have a new, a different drawing and like they have these weird drawings on tanning Jesus. No, that's bringing in Walsh, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:09:03       I think he's crying. No, no. Brian Walsh doesn't cry. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 2:          00:09:09       That's teases him. But, but like when you sign up, there's like this really hot chick and she's like jumping up and down type thing. So really? Yeah. So it's the only way you can see it is if you actually sign up.

Speaker 1:          00:09:18       Hmm. Oh, that's ridiculous. Why not just show me the pictures? Why? Why don't you fucking play games? Um, what, what we like about Ting, first of all, there's a, there's no contracts or ETF. What does ETFs? Probably electronic. Yeah. What does that mean? It says no contracts or ETFs. Should we know what that means? Truly. Incompletely contract free. No early termination fees. Oh, early termination fees. So you don't have early termination fees when you cancel your cell phones. Like if you can't see your contract, if you a three year contract, you have to pay you all the money. Uh, no bundling or riding along services. And so they have, um, no overage charges or penalties. If you use more than you thought you would, you just pay for what you used. You also get credits on unused service. This is where it's crazy. If you use a less than you thought you would, tank drops you down to the level you hit and then credits you the difference on your next bill.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       You can't say that that's a non evil company. You can't, you can't argue with that. That's a good deal. That sounds like a company that is interested in selling you exactly what you need and are going to use as opposed to locking you in some sort of stupid situation that you're, you're probably never going to fully use and you're going to get stuck. You're going to get stuck there. And if you want to get out, you've got to pay. Um, so we like him. We like what they're doing. We liked the, the thought behind it. And if you've got a rogan.ting.com and save 25 bucks or go to that other dude say 50, if that's your shit, but just go get some tanks, get some in your life about their opinion. Get some to take up any new hooker. Uh, we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com um, makers of the hemp force, a protein supplement which is made out of uh, the highest protein hemp and it's like really fucking intense stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:11:19       It's my favorite protein powder. It's all like, it's got raw cocoa in it. It's gotten Maka in it, so it's got antioxidants in it. And Makkah is supposed to do something, something like a muscle building or the, the idea is that it increases testosterone or something, I don't know at some fucking funky route, but the combination of them with the Stevia, it tastes fantastic. Um, for two days in a row I've been drinking this upgraded coffee stuff. I decided I'm going to get off Starbucks. Starbucks can socket. All right this, there's some funky coffee out there, man. If Dave Asprey's correct, if he's saying that, uh, all these coffees have toxic mold on it and that's what a, it's slowly poisoning people and that people were drinking mold that drinking mold, mold t basically while, um, we started carrying this stuff and on it called upgraded coffee.

Speaker 1:          00:12:13       And a, the idea behind it is it's from a single source, it's processed so that you know that it's entirely mold free package sealed and then it gets to you. And when, when you get coffee that's from like a single source like this, like real quality coffee. It's really weird, but you don't get like nearly as much of a crash when, when you're coming off of it. And I don't understand it. And uh, you know, Dave Asprey's version of bulletproof coffee, we're drinking it right now. It's got a grass fed butter and MCT oil and the coffee blended together as your shit's been oilier. They come both firing out like logs on a river son boom. But, uh, his, um, his coffee is, uh, the, the combination of the MCT oil and the grass fed butter with the coffee all blended together. It's crazy. Like you, it gives you energy for hours and when it's over it's just, it's, it's much more mild, at least for me than other coffee, which leads to me to believe that he might be right.

Speaker 1:          00:13:19       I might've been, I might've been drinking fungus t I might've been drinking some moldy ask beans. And uh, according to that guy from that dangerous grounds show, apparently a large percentage of the coffee that we get in this country has mold on it and that's fucking crazy. So um, so we immediately started carrying that as soon as we heard about it. And that's the kind of shit that on it is into doing anything that we, we start caring. It's because either we use it and we love it or we heard it's the best shit or it's what people have been requesting. Whether it's killer bee honey, nobody was requesting killer bee honey. Okay. Nobody would, why would you want to kill her honey? Cause it's gangster as fuck to steal some honey from some killer bees. I'm sorry. Even if it doesn't taste as good, I am going to go with the killer bee honey every time.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       Cause I'm stupid like that. All right. And if you want some killer bee honey, we got that shit. This is real killer bee honey. It's a, I love it. So that's the kind of shit that we carry it on it from the hemp force. Unfortunately we have to buy it from Canada. We have to buy all of our hemp protein from Canada because cause people are crazy. And because hemp is the non-psychoactive a version of the marijuana sativa plants. The hemp is the uh, the, you know, the, the way it works is like you can call them cousins or strains or now this has been a lot of argument and anger online about nomenclature. But the bottom line is that the, the hemp, when you, when you're, when you're getting him in the hemp force protein, you're getting non psychoactive plants. The males are non psychoactive and the females, uh, the ones that you, uh, grow into a marijuana leaves, you have to like separate them from the males, you know, keep the males from getting an Achy in them.

Speaker 1:          00:15:14       You know, you had the like breed together. The plants breed. It's fascinating shit, man. They're, they're, they're literally like a sexual plant while the hemp that we get, we have to get in Canada, so we can't even have a farm. We can't even grow the non psychoactive version. Like you can come check, make sure it's the right stuff. You can't even grow that. They, they, they do. They do not want Americans even growing it for, uh, for use as textiles or as a commodity. They don't want it introduced into the market. It's an incredibly powerful resource. It's one of the greatest plants on earth. I mean, it really is an amazing product. If you stop and think about all the different things that hemp does, it really would blow your fucking mind. And it's kind of a Hippie, explosion, drowning type situation because we've all said, we've heard people talk about it so many times, like especially hippies that just like you, June Newman and hemp has been noonish to shrink tumors.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       Did, you knew that you can make your clothes ahead of him and after a while he just want to go, okay, okay, you're annoying. So I think Hampson knowing too, I'm listening to you and I'm getting crazy noise and I'm assuming that hemp socks cause you suck, well does not suck folks. It is a craziest plant on earth. You can make the finest paper out of it far stronger than paper that we have that's made out of trees. You can make food out of it, you can eat it. It has essential amino acids in it. It has protein. You can make clothes out of it far superior to cotton clothes. You can turn it into fucking heating oil to power the lamps, these, these hemp oil lamps. You can take the oil and you put it on your food and it makes your food far more nutritious.

Speaker 1:          00:17:00       It's a crazy plants. If you juice it, you extract the juice. Apparently it's super healthy, like way healthier than wheat grass juice and it's illegal. We're so fucking stupid when it comes to this that it hurts my brain. But at least we can sell you hemp force grown in Canada. And not that I don't love given Canadians work cause I love me some Canadians. But that's bullshit. It's on. All right. And with that said, use the code neighbor Brogan and you will save 10% off any and all supplements, uh, that, that code does not apply to kettle bells and battle ropes and all that shit because a, all that fitness equipment stuff is super hard to ship and very hard to carry. Like we, we were sending these iron

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       balls in the mail. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:51       It's a, it's a huge pain that Dick. So the uh, the, the discounts on that do not apply because we're trying to sell them to you as cheaply as we possibly can. The battle ropes are the cheapest. You can find that the highest quality, like ship yard ropes. You ever work out with us? Dude? You ever do battle rope workouts? So fun. It's fun. It's savage. Re you feel like you're like Conan or something.

Speaker 3:          00:18:15       Uh, anyway, that's it. Use a code name, Rogan,

Speaker 1:          00:18:18       10% off any supplements and a and that's it. You, Fox, Adam Hunter is here and we're going to,

Speaker 3:          00:18:24       we're fixing to get busy.

Speaker 4:          00:18:29       [inaudible] Adam,

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       welcome to the podcast, sir. It's good to be here.

Speaker 1:          00:18:41       Be here with you as well. My friends and Brian Redman always. What's up buddy? How are you?

Speaker 3:          00:18:47       I'm doing great man. This is like, what are the highlights of my whole career? Not even kidding. That's ridiculous, but thank you. I'm honored and it's ridiculous. At the same time, Adam was, um, uh, really funny, standup comedian and a, a big MMA fan and he said something really funny, uh, on Twitter. You said it on Twitter, right? And, uh, and I, I read it on a, on the air and a god and a bit of trouble. I said that, uh, you want to say it? She said that Martin Kampmann comes from behind more than Lance Bass. Yes. I said, I said, you know, this is a distasteful jokes. And then I said it anyway. No, it was great. You gave me credit for it. And there was a moment of just awkwardness Kohlberg over and looked at you. And he's like, and it was the greatest talking television dude.

Speaker 3:          00:19:37       I was on a crew. I'm on a cruise. I don't, don't get Internet, can't watch the fights, I'm depressed. I'm like working on a ship. They can't. I'm trying. I can't get nothing, no TVS. And then all of a sudden I get a text, my phone was on, it was like, dude, Rogan's blew you up on Twitter, do roving to see a come from behind joke. And I'm like, I don't know who won the fight. And now I'm like looking. I'm like, Dude. I'm like, thank you bro. You don't have no idea how much that meant. It was fucking awesome. People said to me that that's like, oh well like I've heard criticism like total, even though for the Turkey, that is hilarious. If you know who Martin Kampmann is and you know like Martin Kampmann has had some amazing come from behind victories, so to say that he comes from behind more than Lance Bass.

Speaker 3:          00:20:18       I thought that was so funny, man. Oh, thank you. I probably shouldn't have said it on the air. It was DePaul, first of all, Sam, sons of anarchy on the air and that network. I mean this is the show. This is will. People are silly. I mean, I don't think they care. It's just a joke. And if you do care, come on, you just watched a guy get his fucking face beaten in any better get to Anderson Cooper, it would have been just, you know, yeah, that would have probably been better, but I don't even understand what via what the, the would even better. A little bit better because it feels like you're picking on Lance Bass, whereas Anderson Cooper feels like he can defend himself. People I want to know, I went on one of those like, uh, forums and uh, I know underground, right? And people had like pictures of lands, Bass and that says we got your back Bro.

Speaker 3:          00:21:06       I was like, dude, that is the funniest fucking thing. And then people were arguing for like 30 pages, 30 pages of threads back and forth on why someone was like, the only thing is offensive, uh, as, as a gay man is that lance bass, assuming that he comes from behind it, that guy's a a bottom. Like people were like, well, it's not offensive. It's not, I mean, what is wrong with coming? It doesn't everybody want to come? People are having sex. Well, they just want to just like try it real quick and then stop dude. And then someone wrote, this is how the Holocaust started trolling. It's like what do people, but I was like, it was unbelievable. I was like joke to everybody. I tell everybody that choke. It's a funny fucking joke man did. And it's funny cause I started the MMA roasted like about a year ago and like literally Mike, my page has like 5,000 followers and then they roast it has 18 six six 17,000 followers.

Speaker 3:          00:22:01       Like they blew up because people just are like, people seem to love it. You know, cause they've tried to do it in a way where it's not disrespectful but you're still making someone laugh. Yeah. You will walk a fine line. You're making fun of trained killers. I know that's your Twitter, your Twitter page off goofing on trained killers. Absolutely. But like, but they need to laugh too cause like if everyone, you know, why should they speak, you know like at me when you make fun of someone, right. I'm trying to do in a way where it's like I'm roasting them. Like, obviously respect that person and it's trying to make you laugh too. You know, dude fucking pages of Shit that you showed me that you have. Like I have 50 pages of jokes about each frame and like, but it's like, it's cool that I saw them. It's ridiculous. You have so many and the really good ones, man, you've got a bunch of really good ones. Thanks man. I'm one of my favorite one was that, well Steven Seagal said he wants to fight Randy couture but no witnesses just like his last 20 films.

Speaker 3:          00:22:53       It was like, I then I like bright one of them. I wrote uh, one of them, I'm like, cause I'll write something and all of a sudden they'll get 800 retweets. And I'm like, like the only person who gets screwed up from Jersey more than Frankie Edgar is a sneaky, like just, and then people will just be like, blah, blah blah. I'm like, Holy Shit. It became this fucking, like the other night I wrote, if I'm, if I leave any fighters out and you want me to roast you, please do. And all of a sudden all these fighters, John Dodson, it's like roast me, man. I'm short. Well, and then Mike piles like, what am I too good to be fucking roasted it? Like all these pros were like, I was like, Holy Shit. And then like 50 people started roasting those people as well. The, a lot of guys have a sense of humor, you know, for the most part, like Mike Pyle is a great sense of humor. I think that it's, uh, you know, for some dudes though, they're like, who the fuck is this guy? Man Wants to talk to shit on me. I do get a little nervous. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna lie. I get a little nervous when

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       you goof on people, man, they get mad. They don't like it yet. Well, some, some you get mad, but you know, I tried to do it in a way where it's like respectful. I don't mean to hurt anybody's feelings, you know? Yeah. At the same time I tried to do it in a way where like, uh, you know, like, hey, we're just, I don't know. I'm trying to them laugh, you know, it's, it's hard though. It's like someone's following me and then they lose and I want to make a joke and I'm like, aw shit, I don't want them to see it. I'm just like, like what would you do? A frank Trigg was in the room. Would you tell that the, the Frank Trigg joke, oh, Frederick came to my show actually. I don't know. I think he started following me after those jokes.

Speaker 5:          00:24:22       Yeah. I said no, but what would I tell it to? I'm probably, I probably show it to them. I wouldn't know. I would try to gauge his reaction now whether or not he's laughing or not. And then base my reaction on it. What he's going to go. People are like what? We talked about the jug before the show. Oh, about what is told. I don't even know. I said, I said frank, uh, frank Trigg beat his wife so bad. The Bob Sapp topped out. And then I started making fun of SAP and SAP started following me and then followers started making it and I felt bad cause followers or making fun of them and I was like, so then I started defending him and then Bob cycles, it's all cool. It's like whenever we all toast, when we rose Bob Saps, I'm like,

Speaker 6:          00:25:00       great. Wow. Bob Sapp at one point in time was one of the scariest human beings on earth. There was a run that he had when he beat or Nesto who's twice did he beat her? Nesto fucking, yeah. Who at the time was like kickboxing man. Yeah. That was craziness. And he did it just with power. Just sheer hulk strength.

Speaker 5:          00:25:23       Yeah. No, Bob Sapp was, it was a beast. I mean like his nickname too. Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:25:27       that one. There's two fights that he had. Have you ever seen these, Brian? Have you ever seen it? You should pull these up. Bob Sapp versus Ernesto hoost because if people haven't seen this fight, you really don't understand how big Bob Sapp was because he doesn't even look like a real human. He doesn't look real. Yeah, no, it's like some CGI upset versus who? Ernesto hoost. She's a huge star in Japan. After that. I mean he was Ernesto hoost. Is Mr Perfect. One of the greatest kickboxers of all time. Yeah, and he was like incredibly, incredibly technical and it would just chop chop away at you would leg kicks and knock dudes out with head kicks, like set you up with leg kicks and it take you out with a head kick. Very technical like Dutch Moy Tai and Bob Sapp. Just bum rushed him, man. Just 370 pounds with ABS. Look at him. Look at this video.

Speaker 7:          00:26:19       Look at the size of him. Jesus fucking Christ. That's a human look at the size of Bob Sapp. When he was in his prime, he was gigantic. He was a character in a movie. Look, he's getting kicked and he's just fucking moving forward, wailing on him. You're talking about a guy who's just started kickboxing like a year ago and he's in there with Ernesto hoost and look at how he's punching. Look, he's no technique or heart and muscle. Just giant. Can't die. Look at the fucking size of them. Yeah. He's a legend. And looking at Nesta who's just chopping away at those legs, trying to take them out and SAP keeps moving forward, trying to check his legs. He can't even lift his legs up there so fucking big.

Speaker 8:          00:27:11       Hmm.

Speaker 7:          00:27:15       And so slowly starting to get homes tagging him here. Bob Sapp is still moving forward. I don't care how much muscle you have on you, Ernesto. Who's this teen off on your face, son. Boom. Big Leg kick. Anesto oh, we dropped some of the left left to the body. Look at the technique. Beautiful left hook to the body. Now you gotta think, how the fuck does Bob Sapp win this fight? How the fuck does Bob Sapp get up and win this fight? He playing it. Watch this shit. It's like a 10 minute video. Watch this shit though. This is where it gets crazy. Ernesto, who's his fucking crushing him here? And Bob Sapp starts moving forward again and he's holding on to one with one hand and throws him to the ground. I mean, this is fight is insane. This dude just got dropped by vicious left hooks to the body just a few seconds ago. If you wanted this look at like a guy who would be like a genetic experiments. How bad can a guy get and still fuck other dudes up? You can say Bob Sapp right here, but it's not for very long. You can only do this for a couple of years.

Speaker 8:          00:28:42       Yeah,

Speaker 7:          00:28:42       look, he's eaten those leg kicks, man. You've got to go. How the fuck is he still there? Yeah, that's insane. Danny gets hit with that left hook to the body. Jesus Christ. Ernesto, who was just hit him with like 10 unanswered clean shots to his head and Bob Sapp is still there. He's even thinking about kicking him. Just go to the end of the fight so we can watch the end of it because in the second round, Bob Sapp comes back and stops him, but he just, you watch that first round, you go, how the fuck did that guy get out of that round? Anesto who's was teeing off on him? He just kept plodding forward and this is the end. He starts fucking just bombing these hungry, hungry hippo punches on them. Look at this, look at this, boom. And then the referee comes

Speaker 6:          00:29:41       and stops it.

Speaker 8:          00:29:43       That's it.

Speaker 9:          00:29:46       That is incredible. It's, you know what time I got to think that was a premature stoppage and watching that it's a shameless guy. It's like walking around like getting a lot of guys in peak now. You know, cause those guys, it's like the first NBA players are the first baseball players. There is no shame in Bob Saps career and how he came along and when he came along, you can't say it's a shame cause his, the, the Bob Sapp days or some of the most incredibly exciting fights ever. His fight, first of all, he's fight with Minataro d there's a reason why that fight was so excited. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:30:19       And the reason was Bob Sapp, I mean miniature, it was an amazing fighter, right? No doubt about it. But watching the Toro dismantle regular fighters was one thing. But the fact that he was going to take on this superhuman was a completely different entity. You know, and obviously it was important that it was a minute Tara, because Tara had such great Jujitsu, he could handle a big dude like that and roll with all the shots and then get to a point and finally submit them, which he did. But you got to realize that the Bob Sapp factor in that fight was the reason why it was so exciting. It was like, this is fucking giant freak. This guy that's like 370 pounds like with a giant six pack and he's picking you up and slamming you on your head. He slammed him in a towel down on his head, like wrestling style that those, those fights, his fights with um, Ernesto hoost, the kickboxing fights and he had, those are some of the greatest fights to watch over.

Speaker 6:          00:31:18       Just ridiculously entertaining. So that, I don't think you can ever say it's a shame Bob Sapp didn't come along. You know, cause when he was around, like I said, you can only stay that big for a few years. Right. But what he did was just fucking crazy. You know, you can't say that guy doesn't have any hard either. You got to look at that beating that he took with hoost, you know, he's just not willing to take beatings anymore. Yeah. Like now he just, he goes down and I guess he just just doesn't have it in them to like really try to beat the best guys anymore. I sort of just living off his name right. It's kind of unfortunate. Yeah, I think so because at one point in time I just decided he fucking beat Ernesto hoost, you know, I mean Ernesto, who's was trying to kill him and he survived and the referee stopped it. Although I do do agree that it was a or a, I believe that it was a quick stoppage. I don't think, I think who's going to absorb more of those shots? He was standing straight up. Right. You know, those kickboxing matches though. That's uh, they're, they're doing this glory. They had this a world series where they had, uh, they fought four times in a night. Did you see that shit

Speaker 9:          00:32:26       recently? Yeah. Uh, I saw, I write about it. I didn't see it. It's pretty bad ass. I hope they keep doing it. Yeah. What's the name? What Cro? Cop One last weekend. Yeah. Yeah. Cro, cop. And then um, he had

Speaker 5:          00:32:39       an MMA fight, right. He won by arm bar. Arm Bar. Yeah. It looked good. And then Tim Silvia lost.

Speaker 6:          00:32:45       Yeah. He fought a issue, right? Yup. Yeah. He, she looked good. Yeah, I saw that too. Yeah, it's a, it's hard to find a good fights outside the UFC right now. Absolutely. You know, there's, um, like I think Bella tour puts on some good fights and it was Strikeforce, but now Strikeforce going away. So it's like you gotta rely on like dream, you know, and dream doesn't put on that many shows, but they, they just had a nice one to just see that Melvin man who, Dennis Kang.

Speaker 5:          00:33:18       Yeah, the first [inaudible]. That was the great knee to Melvin Manhoef as a scary guy. Yeah. King's garden. They're both scary guys. Thanks. Very scary.

Speaker 6:          00:33:30       He's very good. He's, he can, Dennis Kang is one of those guys that if he got it all together, put it all together on any given night, he could beat any given fighter in the world. You know, he's one of those guys that like when you, when you see him and he's like really on, he's fucking sensational. No, he's had some really good fights. You're real good ground game tail. But he's had, you know, like some mental lapses and shit and it's fucking hard man. It's a crazy sport to try to do that sport for a living and have your, your sanity depending on it. And then as you get older you start reevaluating your priorities and then you gotta to, of rededicate yourself to something. And

Speaker 5:          00:34:04       yeah, no, I, I know I wrestled in high school and college and it was like my whole life there was wrestling and then when I stopped doing it, I was like, now what am I going to do? You know,

Speaker 6:          00:34:13       that happens a lot of athletes. Yeah. It happens to a lot of people. I got really lucky that I found a standup comedy at the exact same time. I was a stopping competing. There's basically like a, or it was pretty organic, the shift from one to the other, but I had a lot of friends that they just would, nothing seemed as real and it's as fun as competition. Yeah. You know, I have friends that would, Jujitsu competition is that way to them. You know, for some it was the, you know, the karate tournament or kickboxing or whatever. It is like the thrill of competition, even though there's a lot stress behind it, the thrill is like, it's really hard to wrap your head around.

Speaker 5:          00:34:52       Yeah, absolutely. I mean to me, right? Yeah. I mean it was like the biggest rush and you put so much into it and then you come down from it and you just like, ah man. You know, now what? Now what? Luckily I got, I had a talk show in college but ended up getting sued for $20 million. Yeah. It was like a talk show in college, cause I wrestled in high school. That was my whole thing. And I went to college and I'm like, what am I going to do? I wrestled for Suny Binghamton, actually got a scholarship wrestle for Hofstra and I would've burned on the same team as Baroni and uh, and what's his name? And um, J and j Hieronymus, it's a heron, which would have been insane. But I went to Binghamton and I was like, after I was done wrestling, I was like, what am I going to do?

Speaker 5:          00:35:32       I want it like, you know, get something going. So I used to prank the local television every Thursday night. They'd be like, let's go. Okay. Yeah, cause I was cutting weight and I was miserable. And you need to have a serious political combination, but hey, you debate and debate on my Dick and then hang up the phone, mark. Goodness. So then I ended up going down to the station and got my own television show called Deez nuts, but it ended up, the show was called Deez nuts. Yeah. Yeah. And I invited this girl up. People would call it and be like, you suck. I'm like, oh. And I was, I had nothing to talk about, kind of like now, but I had nothing to actually, so I was like this, this girl came on, everyone hooked up with named Hannah. I want started making fun of her. She goes back to her dorm, people start throwing water balloons out her and then they cancel all the shows on Binghampton television. Uh, because because of my in the night and she sued me for 20 million from negligence cause I didn't stick up for her, but I didn't, I didn't ask her to come down. But then that was the highlight of my life at that, at that point. And I go, I want to be a comedian. This is, how do I get back to this to have mental talk shit.

Speaker 9:          00:36:29       Wow.

Speaker 5:          00:36:32       Deez nuts. I don't know man. It was, yes, I was seven 17 I'm 17 years old. Well I'm glad there's no

Speaker 9:          00:36:41       record of me like that from when I was 17 I would have done some stupid shit if I could have my, like my own internet show when I was 17 oh, people would play it back today. But like, look how douchey you were.

Speaker 5:          00:36:51       Oh yeah. Well I'm just, you know, not that you're any douchey, but everybody's douchey when they're 17 absolutely, man,

Speaker 9:          00:36:58       it's almost impossible. Nappy. It's too confusing. And plus we were raised by our parents and I've never met a single person raised by parents that knew what the fuck they were doing. Yeah, that's true. Those pitches were winging it in the 50s and mom left us three. Whoa. Yeah, so that was why my bringing me down like this.

Speaker 5:          00:37:16       I'm not planning, I'm trying to get you to know where I'm coming from. Dude. I'm not just gaming. I'm not stuck. I'm making fun of Bob Sapp. Okay. Sorry. Just fucking with you, man. Anyway, I was trying to talk,

Speaker 9:          00:37:28       talk to each other, ladies and gentlemen. Okay. There's no real animosity. There were just fuck with each other. I was just trying to make you laugh. So you lied about your mom.

Speaker 5:          00:37:37       No, I didn't. No, no. I brought it up. I, it is true. I know it's true. I swear to God, I was trying, I brought it up to make you laugh. Oh, Jesus Christ. That would make you laugh like ha ha ha. Breaking it up to make you laugh and make you laugh. I don't know. Some weird parallel universe.

Speaker 9:          00:37:55       I uh, I haven't talked to my dad since, I think it was seven. Oh really? Yeah. So I know what you're talking about. Sorry. Sorry to hear that. Sorry. It doesn't bother me anymore. I'm sure it did when I was seven.

Speaker 5:          00:38:07       Yeah. Well I feel like that when you lose something when you're young, like a mom or a dad, it just, that to me that was the inner rage in me at least.

Speaker 9:          00:38:16       Yeah. That's what they say about boys in divorce as well. They say that like girls, like when parents separate, girls get sad and the boys get angry. Yeah. Yeah. She lives and fulfill, abandon the, drives them to try to succeed at things

Speaker 5:          00:38:32       at any, anything. And to me now is comedy cut. Like that's, I love MMA so much. But to bring it back was because the wrestling like you, it's, to me MMA is professional wrestling, like not like pro wrestling, you know? WBB But like that's our major leaks. Right. So I always root for those guys, but I wouldn't have gotten into wrestling if it wasn't for the rage of, of like my mom leaving and then I wouldn't have gotten a comedy if it wasn't for that rage too. So now I can bring it all back by combining MMA and comedy.

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       That's funny. Um, have you ever done, I mean you've been doing these, uh, these roasted videos now and if you ever done anything that you wish you pulled back,

Speaker 5:          00:39:09       have I ever said something? And I said, Bro, I go pretty Palmer, more guys that pulled out at one 51 that Brittany polymer. Right. And, and, and, and I, I think it hurt her feelings because I like met her up before that and she was super sweet and kind and I, and I kind of like burned a bridge there because then I felt bad because I was only, there was only a hearsay that she took. She said in the video, I like fighters. There's a video of her on youtube saying, oh, fighters are cute or something, how to pick up Brittany Palmer or whatever it is. So I figured if she's comfortable enough with that, then I could say that.

Speaker 1:          00:39:39       Oh well that's ridiculous. Listen man, if you're a girl like Brittney Palmer, they do these questionnaire things and I'm sure they ask her like, how do you feel about fighters?

Speaker 10:         00:39:47       And I being set up is the whole UFC outside, right? Oh, walk outside, it's going to be killed. And Brittany Palmer and never do this. Bruce buffer and Gober. How dare you. I would never do that. No Dude, this is like nobody wants it

Speaker 1:          00:40:00       set you up. I look, I think it's funny. I love her. She's a, she's a nice kid. She's, you know, but she's a girl and girls don't like dudes making jokes about pulling dicks out of them.

Speaker 10:         00:40:14       Absolutely.

Speaker 5:          00:40:14       I understand that there has, but there's always gotta be a victim in comedy.

Speaker 1:          00:40:19       And I know, I understand. I'm on your side as well. I tried to make it nice up. Listen, I work with those girls and they're very nice and the nice to me and we're friends. So like I would never crack jokes about them cause I love them. They're there, they're sweet girls. But I, you know, when you, you say something like that, I have to laugh. It's funny,

Speaker 5:          00:40:36       I had to laugh because there's a certain truth. It if I, if I like, and that's why you're laughing. If I would've said Kim Winslow's more fighters have hooked up with a lot of it, then Kim Winslow, you would have been like, ah, nope.

Speaker 1:          00:40:48       Well, you know, first of all, you just assuming that she's hooked up with fighters, unless you,

Speaker 10:         00:40:54       I do know. I don't want, okay. I know of one, so I'm not, I'm not assuming. Okay, awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:41:00       It's very womanly and gossipy because you, you haven't had conversations with her about this. No. But you and her having talked about like, so this is just you finding out about her dating life online.

Speaker 5:          00:41:13       No, front people from friends of fighters or fighters themselves. So I'm not like, okay, yes, I understand.

Speaker 10:         00:41:21       No, no, I've just made it worse. I was

Speaker 1:          00:41:26       going to say it, but it's funny and that's the problem. It's funny. And even though it's, it's, it's operating on a notion that these attractive girls would make these attractive guys had perceived

Speaker 3:          00:41:40       for legal reasons. Yeah. Sorry about that man. Fuck I was to represent people correctly. Yeah, I know. I got another. But uh, my, my point is it's still funny, so you got to say thank you. And you know what? Um, and if you're a person that's getting mugged on like that, you have to laugh at the good ones. Oh, right. I know. I always like my comedy. I get, I'm on a storyteller. Comedy, I tell jokes really quick one liner jokes. Twitter is great for me. It's like an online focus room. You know, I got to tell a joke and you get 50 people, a hundred guys at all hours of the day. It's great. Yeah. You really look a Twitter writer. It's like a, it's funny how was styles,

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       comedy are so different. You know like some guys like Ari Shaffir for example, he writes in like long bits, you know, he writes like he'll start talking about something and he'll explore a subject and then he'll write like this long bit where it's like you're like, you're, you're like 150 characters. You're good

Speaker 3:          00:42:34       hundred 30 cause you gotta get it retweeted. I actually figured this out. That's so silly at 20 but can you just hit the retweet button and it doesn't know, just retweet down, sees that whatsapp, is that really it gets cut off or something? No one sees the actual retweets. Not a lot of people have it set so that you know, they don't see retweets. Oh, right, right. Why would you do that? That's silly. I find that I'm one of the most of the cool shit from retweets.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       So someone tells me something, you know, like if, if somebody sends me something really interesting and then I retweeted, you know, I'm retweeting it because it's interesting. I would,

Speaker 3:          00:43:11       yeah, but if you retweeted the opposite though, the way of putting the rt before it, more people will see it then as then actually just hitting the retweet butts. So I'll start doing that. Then we got to destroy our team. Yeah. Why you make a lot more people, a lot more people and just worked having to remember that. And that's the actual work probably is the fact that I have to remember it, you know? Yeah. Maybe I should use like tweet deck. What's the best shit to use? Uh, I like tweet Bot. Tweet Bot. Okay. Yeah, it's stressful. And did you see Alex Jones? Oh my God. Oh my [inaudible] about it at a red light. Yeah, this is, I guess he was on on, well, who show was this? Here's Morgan. He's trying to get it. I'll give you the background

Speaker 1:          00:43:54       before he puts Alex Jones, because Pierce Morgan said that we should all, we should take our guns. You know, we should no longer a that the second amendment no longer applies in today's age. And with all these school shootings and shit, we should figure out how a way to control the guns. Well, Alex said that he's not even an American citizen. He should be deported for saying such things and challenging our second amendment rights. So, uh, Pierce Morgan, like the slide devil that he is invited Alex to go on his show. And so Alex went on a show and promptly, promptly lost his fucking mind. Promptly. Completely went off the deep end. He looks like a Chubby Madman and I love him. You know, Alex is my brother. I love that dude. Every time I go to Austin, I hang out with that guy. We eat dinner, I do his radio show. We did a little, a cool backstage interview and me and Brian Recently, I fucking love Alex Jones and he's right about a lot of shit that the documents, but this is those. The documents has got the documents.

Speaker 11:         00:44:57       Those are the documents and play it play at a level. But overall muggings, stabbings, deaths, you those men, right? That woman in India to death with an iron rod four feet long. You can't ban the iron rods that guns the iron rods. Pierce didn't do it. The tyrants did it. Hitler took the guns stolen, took the guns, mounted the guns that don't. Castro took the guns, go. Chavez took the guns and I'm here to tell you it's two. The 76 will commence again if you proud to take our firearms. It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken. We will not relinquish them. Do you understand? And that's why you're going to fail. And the establishment knows, no matter how much propaganda the republic will rise again. When you attempt to take our guns for half family and the first of all, pause right here. Pierce Morgan

Speaker 1:          00:45:45       fucked up. He fucked up. Pierce, what have you done? You let Alex Jones on your show. You just let Alex Jones go off on your show.

Speaker 3:          00:45:57       You think it's going to help them though? I mean the first sure. It'll help them. You don't think people are going to look at that and be like, this guy's out of his mind for sure. There's going to be that as well. Mimicking his accident at one point was running for president member or I'm already flipped out and said, we're going to this and that and that. It reminds you of,

Speaker 11:         00:46:20       yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:46:21       Yeah. He went crazy and then that was it. They're like, we're not getting this guy from our president. That one sound that he made Sanches whole campaign. It's kind of the, don't you think that people are looking at the message that this guy's doing is out of control? Rant. Lunatic. How did Howard Dean never recover from that? How would you need to like get your shit together? Come back. He was like strong. Oh. He was up there and he was a strong candidate man. Smart Guy. Governor of Vermont, right? Yep. That's a little sketchy fucker. People Vermont. 20 people up there. Yeah, it's me. Come on. Let's be real. That's true. We'll probably going to get tweets from people that are in Vermont. Dude. Fuck you. This is way more than 20 people. It's amazing computer. I know. He likes skiing. Okay. I went to high school in Maine. That was pretty amazing. Yeah, you were talking about that. Where, where'd you go? I went to a boarding school called the Hyde School. It was like for a kids who needed a kidney. Yeah, like alternative education. It was really good though. I mean

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       alternative education. What does that mean? Alternative to regular school, which was a problem.

Speaker 3:          00:47:21       Yeah, because I, because I was, I was hanging out with the wrong, I was getting bullied a lot and I was hanging out with the wrong kids and I thought if I hung out with the, with the tough kids that like, then I would be tough. But they just kicked my ass, made me do horrible things, awful strategy. And then I was angry at my stepmom for an, you know, my dad and my dad managed Alice Cooper in the, in the 60s. And he, he has this, he's like a Hippie, great father. But he was, he was talking about pot back then, whatever. My mom, you set mom, we get along and how we do it. But anyway, I got sent to boarding school for troubled kids and uh, wow. You couldn't, you couldn't lie, steal, cheat, drink, have sex. So you were like a bad kid.

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       You're on your way. Not that it was your fault, but it was my fault. I'm not going to take, yeah, I wasn't bad. It wasn't a bad kid, but I definitely had wrong energies. I could have been focusing on more positive things in my life. I think for a lot of kids, life is like a really super complicated puzzle that doesn't have an directions book. Fuck, where am I going for most of us, like by the time we're like, you know, someone's telling you to get a job, get out of the house, you got to get a job and you know, move out on your own and you're like, what did you motherfuckers teach me? Like you didn't teach me enough life skills to sustain myself. Or the worst thing that they need to teach a kid is that adults are always right. Yeah. Because you assume that they're older. They're right. When, how many dumb asses do you know are our age? You know, age doesn't mean anything. As a matter of fact, there's a lot of people that, I used to think they're really smart, but somewhere along the line stop thinking, I don't know what the fuck happened, but the, sometimes I think I'm smart, a word will come up and I'll be like, what does that mean? And it's like opens up a whole book of things I don't know. And I'm just like, ah, Jesus.

Speaker 3:          00:49:07       I'm like, I got to learn some shit, man. No one can be smart in this day and age. She could be reasonably knowledgeable. That's the best you could hope for it. There's just too much information to the jail. I feel like you're wired and I'm not trying to like, like kiss your ass or blow you right there. I feel like you're wired in a way or like, you know, so much more stuff than like the average Joe. Like I, I'll, I'll read your tweet, your Twitter sometimes and I'm like three o'clock in the morning, five like, like 12 one four and all different subjects and I'm like, when and then you're touring and then I'm like, well this guy's got two kids. When does this fucker, it's sleep. Like how do I get some water? This guy has, you know, like you don't, you know, tweeting dessert require that much energy.

Speaker 3:          00:49:50       Like you're always like onto some, fuck, you're right. Like always send some weird island or traveling the world. They're like at a comedy show or doing. I'm like, why does he have time to do Jujitsu for fucking two hours a day to get a black belt? I'm like, fuck man, you just do it this way. I could do a lot more. I'm lazy. This is a lot of shit that I could be doing that I'm not doing. But I like relaxing. I like playing pool too. I like doing a lot of shit. It's not productive, but the reason I have energy to do it, it's cause it's all interesting shit. Like if I'm retweeting something that I read at two o'clock in the morning, it's because it's cool. Like it's interesting, weird or it's disturbing. Maybe. Maybe

Speaker 6:          00:50:28       it's, you know, something I think requires discussion or thought I just got to get more interested. I guess that's the problem. And more interested in science. I'm like, Oh man, I think I would know stuff if I gave a fuck about that. I'm like, well right now, you know, you're, you and I are in different stages of our life too. And you're in the stage of your life where you're trying to, you know, make your name as a comic and you know, you're hustling and trying to put shit together and you got an, you got no time for that nonsense. Constantly out there trying to fucking

Speaker 5:          00:50:55       oh hustling man. Like, I mean, literally I got back from Nevada to an eight hour trip yesterday. I got no car accidentally back. I did three fucking three sixties into the fucking bang, got home and hit the wall, got home coach wrestling at like three at three o'clock from my middle school wrestling team. I coach with Einstein, which is a blast, but it's like, like the other day in practice, it's the inner city school. I go, hey guys, we have practice tomorrow. He goes, I can't, I'm like, why? He's like, I have court. I'm like fucking middle school wrestling team. I'm like, what is wow. Yeah, me or already me and Connor hewn coached together. Me and Connor. Connor was the coach and now I'm a coach up with Einstein. Scott Epstein. Nice. Which is cool. But um, and then fucking came here. It's like hustle. And he's like, but I was, I feel like I was always hustling, man. Like 12 years ago I was giving out, you know, flyers in the street and Times Square, begging people to come to the comedy shows. And that was an in laundromats performing, you know, and there was a was out here and that New York City. Oh, you send Times Square. Yeah. Like here.

Speaker 6:          00:51:57       That's how much I'm paying attention to right now. Thank you man. Just kidding. Sorry ma'am. Um, the, um, that method of getting people in the comedy clubs that actually works in New York, so many people are walking, you know, he can like hand them flyers and they'll go, fuck it. We'll try like people that will stand out in front of places.

Speaker 5:          00:52:15       I didn't, dude. I used to have it down packed. Right. See tourists look up and I'm like, Fuck God. I'm like, as soon as they look up, I'm like, they're looking at wherever. Got It. And then I bring them into the comedy show. It'd be me and like the seven other comedians that were giving out flyers. So they look up, they're looking for something to do and then lying to everyone saying, oh, comics from MTV VH one common. Meanwhile it's us giving out the fucking fliers, you know, then try and make them laugh. Then as soon as you got to say, and you're like, that's the fucker gave me the fucking flyer. Like how funny is he? And I would walk the half the half the room to the entire room because of my, if I was the dirtiest people were like from Oregon or whatever except for the two chicks that were hot and I get him back to my room and smoke weed and try to bang them.

Speaker 6:          00:52:56       I remember, uh, in the early days of comedy, a dude's always had fake credits. Like you've seen this guy and MTVs half hour comedy. I know you hadn't, he hadn't been on that shit. But to say that just saying that made a bar and you know, Andover, Massachusetts way through except it. Okay, guys been on MTV. Let's see what he's got.

Speaker 5:          00:53:17       Exactly. Yeah. The one time I was plunging the toilets at New York comedy club to get on stage and the, it was like a prom show or after the prom, like they, the kids to the comedy club and uh, and all the comics left because the PR then was late. So Ozzy, this Guy Ozzie, he goes, how much time do you do? I'm like, two minutes. Can you do 45 sure. You know, and then, then, then, then I'm back there and then the guy goes comics. That's Comedians from MTV VH one. I'm looking around like, who the fuck is here? They're like Adam Greenberg. That's my real name. Cause almost like, so then I fucking walk up there and uh, and do 45 minutes for these funds to change her name from Greenberg to hunter. Uh, well,

Speaker 9:          00:53:53       because hunter is not a Douchey last name, unless you call yourself a hunter. It is, it gets, it gets tricky.

Speaker 5:          00:54:00       Well, I'll tell you why. It's actually a story there. It's actually a real story and it's going to be, this is kind of sad actually.

Speaker 9:          00:54:05       Dude, you bum me out again. Fuck them for those. At home, we're playing. Okay, we're buddies joking around. I'm not going to say fuck me until I get into that. Let me back up my car. And I didn't really say is times square or round here because I was thinking of something that was my, I wasn't really shitting on them. That was fake.

Speaker 5:          00:54:23       So a hunter. So anyway, I used to work, I work at the volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House for three years in New York. I was like the head volunteer. I'd make them all laugh and I bring dates. Actually it was good way. No, but I will once in a while I bring a girl, but not, that was not why I did it. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          00:54:38       that would be impressive. You know, you did a show there. Well, yeah, we did shows for the kids and working on, she would think, oh my God, he's so sweet. Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:54:44       exactly. The one time though, it backfire because, uh, I brought my ex girlfriend and she's like this little girl who had like cancer. It was like five. She was like, Oh, I'm okay. This is my friend who was, uh, uh, you're not as pretty as the girl Adam brought last week. Oh

Speaker 9:          00:54:59       No.

Speaker 5:          00:55:00       I was like, you fucking cock. Oh my God. But that was wow. That was like one of the best times of my life. Those kids were awesome. But the one kid, his name is hunter and it's by my dad. My Dad kept telling me that everyone hates Jews in Hollywood and that everybody and that I'm never going to make, and I'm never gonna make it. My last name's Greenberg because people that don't want to see a big office box office guy, you don't see Brad Pitt. You don't see you, you know Tom Cruise and Adam Greenberg. You've got to change it to something. And so then that finally I was like, all right, I'll fucking change my name. And so I was like, you know what? This kid is my best. I'm like his best friend and it will always remind me of a good time in my life with these kids. So I changed it to hunter. Oh,

Speaker 9:          00:55:41       that's very sweet. That's what that is a sweet story. But, uh, I think you would have been fine with Greenberg. I think so too early in the world of stand out it was like the dumb and crazy and then like a month later on, my dad was a stupid as day. The Jews are going to be upset. You don't claim them well, you know, I mean, you know, like I had Italian people that were upset that my name is Rogan. They're like, I thought you were telling him. I'm like, I'm mostly Italian, but my, my Irish grandfather, that's how it was. His name, Rogan. That's where it comes from. So it's like, it's like one quarter of that and three quarters Italian. But the fact that they can't claim you,

Speaker 5:          00:56:16       well I, I don't think they will try to claim me Jews very upset. You're not claiming this claiming that my am Jewish.

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       So you were worried about Greenberg? I was growing up, my dad actually, and anytime, like if we get into fights, like I should have been published, Greenberg, I'd be famous by now. So I always had kind of had that overall know hilarious. What I did it for the opposite reason because a rifle, you know, like third Reichel yeah, right.

Speaker 1:          00:56:45       Ben To write cold. It makes sense because you know you had that name just as, because it's the band that goes x rated or r rated movies that to let you know that dirty shit's about to happen though. Yeah. So, uh, that made sense. Right. But yeah, Greenberg

Speaker 3:          00:57:03       I know, I know. I know. My nickname was greeny. Does cool nickname. You lost your identity. Fuck man. I know. Well no I don't, I still have my identity. I'm still happy with who I am.

Speaker 1:          00:57:16       It's a cute name. Uh, when you think about the story behind it.

Speaker 5:          00:57:20       Yeah. What's, what's and last comic standing shouldn't so cute. That's kind of saying they kept trying to get me to tell that story and I wouldn't tell it

Speaker 3:          00:57:27       she did for this podcast. Well, cause I was like, they wanted me to be like vote for me and then hold up a picture of the kid and I was like, wow. It's like, oh man. I was like, no, I can't,

Speaker 5:          00:57:37       can I do that? Like, I was like, I can't, you know who's who was producing that show? I don't know. I mean it was a, I was happy it showed their life for me. I went, I went from feature to call feature add a month. He'll be here all week. It's what is, what is it like doing those, um, those boats? Oh, the ships. Cruise ship. It's, you know what, like I have a girlfriend, so it kind of sucks because like literally if you want to get, I like, it's like the pussy you can get, that's what it looks like. Him fucking bang that the passengers. But, but it says like, but you could fuck the staff and it's awful. Like the massage girls and like the dancers and you come in as the comic and then they get the guests all fucking surround you after the shows.

Speaker 5:          00:58:19       They're like, ah, that's, that's, that's the good part. And like the good part is sometimes I'll be like in Aruba or Cancun or part of my art there and in the fucking ocean at like noon that everyone paid thousands of that. And I'm like, I'm getting paid for this. This is fucking awesome. So that's the good part. And the shows 300 people every, every single show, you know, and, and five shows every two days. And the money's fucking great. That's the good part. The bad part is that is that, you know, the same crowd comes to every single show. So you gotta do five shows. So like I didn't got to do five 30 different, 30 minute shows different cause like

Speaker 3:          00:58:54       doing different joke, true doing different jokes. Right.

Speaker 5:          00:59:00       It's just you up there like the lady goes, give it up for out of butter and then you go up, there's no like, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah blah. And one fund company or me and my girlfriend broke up for like a week one time. And uh, and I hooked up with it. Like the chick that did that and I'm like, give it up for, for, uh, you know, Jennifer, she gets the best blowjobs in the shoe. Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:59:17       It was like, oh, well she really was giving me the best books on how rude. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       All right. Maybe it wasn't that funny. Okay. But uh, no for Jennifer wasn't. Yeah, that wasn't her real name. I changed her name. Um, she was laughing, shake your head and be like, oh Jesus. Oh, Oh Adam. But boy they break dancers are the ones that clean house. Those guys get all the fucking break dancers. Yeah. Cause they're with the guests all day long and teaching him how to La on a dance and it's all cougars. Oh. Oh that's hilarious. This like a whole ecosystem on a boat. Like the Filipinos and the Indians, they put on the bottom, the Italians and the top, the middle. They get the best view cause they're part of the Italian navy. It's like a whole, it's a wow. No. Did you freak out when that one boat hit the fucking rocks in Italy? And that happened in, uh, I forgot where that was, but that was pretty crazy.

Speaker 5:          01:00:12       Yeah. When those people died then the guy did it cause he was trying to show off to his girlfriend and then get closer and then he didn't show up to, well moron. What a crazy fuck. He and he and he like left the boat. And I slept everyone else. But anyway, back to the, the happiness, the cruises. It's so easy to get like pussy on it because the guests are all like surrounding you and you're like the star or the ship. And then, uh, I like went downstairs. I'm like beating off angrily in my room. Don't be angry.

Speaker 5:          01:00:43       Why? Why are you beating off angrily? Because I wanted to bang the chicks and I'm faithful. It's why the anger like fuck man, shut the fuck those shakes. Like, I don't know. It's really put, shouldn't put angry and fucking killer like that. Just try to keep them out of your head. I'm sorry dude. I mean that's how I, that's what I wished my vocab but there is better but that's what, those are the words going through my head as I'm just fucking with it. You can't get porn on the shit. That's the hard part. No porn at all. No, they blocked the porn. It's just like, oh, that's so silly. How do they block? It just says like this act, this website is blocked porn, right? Nobody has like hard copy anymore. Everything is a youporn and put the cruises are funny. Like, cause they have like special people go on the cruises.

Speaker 5:          01:01:27       Like I did the boys to men crews. Like they were on the ship rewarming yeah. And then uh, like Richard Simmons has a cruise, but he only brings like, you only brings like a couple hundred people. Um, and it, but the rest of the cruise, if regular people to a crew sounds like it could be madness. And then he gets up, starts dancing at breakfast. All these fat people start getting up and dancing, but they're the ones, not everyone is there for the Richard Simmons crews. So people are like, why the fuck are these fat people dancing right now? And like, oh no, no, no, no, no. It's not the whole boat. No, it's like half the boats. And people were like, is that Richard Simmons? Is that like fuck. Could imagine

Speaker 6:          01:02:06       if you like, we're going to go on vacation, we're going to go on a nice boat. I'm gonna sit back where a cocktail and no one's going to bother me. This is it. I got a nice [inaudible]. I worked hard for this moment. And you're sitting out there with your bathrobe on when you're fucking slippers and it's just a sea of giant women dance

Speaker 5:          01:02:26       the case and the gay dancing in front of you every day

Speaker 6:          01:02:33       the women are crying and everyone's emotional. They're hugging it out, everyone's talking get out after class and it's ridiculous. You're transfixed.

Speaker 5:          01:02:43       Uh, I've had people try to fight me like, uh, on the, on the boat will not fight me. But like one time I was on stage and this woman was going to the bathroom and she was a lesbian, but I didn't know that. So I was like, what are you going to change that change a tire or something. And then she's like, give me the microphone. So she runs up and I'm holding it above my head and she's jumping for it. And I was like, the crowds laughing. I'm like, well, you can tell she's not good with Cox. He kept grabbing the microphone. You know what I'm saying? Whatever sticks out in my head. It turns out she was a lesbian. She was, and she was having fun. He could go get wasted on these ships. I mean, you get like wasting, you know, so that's, it's, it's good. I mean, yeah, right.

Speaker 6:          01:03:18       But when they go on vacation, they just, they go too far, but you get too drunk. Some people were just so excited to get drunk. They're just so excited to just fucking a wash it away for a few days.

Speaker 5:          01:03:31       Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean, I see people go crazy on the three 11 ship. Someone jumped off it. What's a three 11 shit when like the three 11 performed the band yet they had a cruise that they all have their own crews and someone jumped off the boat yeah. To like, cause then Jamaica like 50 miles out or something so I could make it, oh no he didn't. He tried to swim 50 fucking miles. Oh my God. So what did they do? He'd be like, broke his arm and he had to go rescue him. Oh my God. He broke his arm hitting the water. Jesus fucking Christ son. Ah.

Speaker 6:          01:04:05       Did you imagine how bad of a feeling of, oh my God, I fucked up. You would be if you were one arm in the water broken 50 miles from shore and no, you're such a Douche bag. No one even says anything like

Speaker 5:          01:04:18       yeah, let him fucking swim. I saw someone get knocked out at a bachelor party one time. Like he said something to a girl, bachelor party since the new girl and the girl's boyfriend was there, it came and knocked the dude out and the bachelor party just like dropped them off Miami and left him. They're like, well we didn't like him anyway. So who got dropped off? The guy who got knocked out, I got knocked out. Oh so he said something fucked up. Yeah it was his fault. But the guys just left him and so the other guys continued on the on the tree. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          01:04:43       That's kind of a win. That's definitely a big win. He can put that one on your record. If you can knock a guy out and you get to a party on the boat that he used to be on, but he's not on anymore cause they pulled him off. There had to be more than that story. That guy had to be an Uber dude. Yeah. Yeah. Most people must have saw that coming and they must've been plenty of documentation there.

Speaker 5:          01:05:07       See the wedding video or the I did the comedy or the guy attacked me at the wedding. Yeah. What was that about? Uh, what happened was they hired me to like, do I get, I get it. I'm on this thing called Gig masters were like, I'm sure how comics now I got to get to go on it. But basically like you get hired to do these gigs, right? So I got one one week I got hired at dude, like these random gigs. Like one week I got hired to do a baby shower or I'm doing comedy during a baby shower and like the chick was fucking hot. It's hot Brazilian chick, but he, she hated her husband or something. I'm like, whatever. So, uh, like I was like, do you, how the hell did you get her? You know, you're not gonna be able to, she was hoc, resilient, but I think she hated the family.

Speaker 5:          01:05:44       Wanted the how to comic to Piss everyone off because she was pregnant basically. That's what happened. But this other thing at the wedding, so it feel like roast everybody just roast every and they don't give me anything like to go on to go on, just go out there, pretend you're the pre, it's marrying people, the minister and then, and then start roasting people. So I'm like, all right, fine. 1000 bucks. Like do it. So I'm like dearly beloved.

So then it was like, then it was going well. Well let's go. It was actually getting after that. People will kind of bonded together that that was awkward, but I kind of went, well, no. Well definitely not. Well, I'm not going to, I'm not going to go there. It's got a lot of credit there. It went better than that. So then I started going and then the mother's starts yelling at me going, no one wants to hear about your sex life. I, so then I'm like, ah, it just gets, then I got to do 10 minutes after that. Finally, the guy by your sex life, dude, it was so awkward. I'm like, one more to do clean jokes on the cruises.

Speaker 5:          01:09:38       You got to do 30 minutes crystal clean. So I'm like, I had 30 minutes clean jokes cause there's like kids area on the cruise. Anyway. So anyway, so then after that, after that happened, I had to wait to get my check and that guys pacing around inside and I'm like, and people were like, [inaudible] people gave me their business cards, so do my weddings. And uh, this clip actually I got contacted by a company in England. It's going to be on a TV show in England, like the 10 worst weddings of all time. And uh, they gave me another thousand. So I was like, yeah, dude, it was funny. But uh, yeah, that's a Gig that you kind of take. Ah, it's one of those money gigs. Yeah. Like how are we going to do this? A fucking, I'm just going to do it. But I've had so many of those kinds of experiences where like just doing terrible, terrible gigs, you know, what do you get them?

Speaker 5:          01:10:24       Like someone called a club and say we need a comedian and do something. Exactly. Or like, yeah, some bizarre comedian to just being an asshole at our wedding. But I used to work at, at playboy I was the warmup comic. That was the, the Helis Gig on the playboy channel. They had this thing called night calls or it was like Jesse Jane and some other girl customer price for hosting it at like 15 naked chicks scissoring each other and fisting each other. Like Jesus, just craziness. Right. It's like Brian's house fisting each other. I mean, they weren't, there was history. So like what ended up happening, but they would have, like Steve o was on or had Tony, Tony, Tony would perform some random talk show and like it was like the show was like, why? It's okay to cheat or something, you know? And I was the warmup comic, so I got to do comedy while they're not filming and it's like the crowd is like 20 people that don't want to be seen there and I'm their view of

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       20 naked chicks. I'd be more like a mixer. Where are you from? You know? And they're playing music over me. God like, yeah, I've had some of the worst. It's almost like when you want to have, but you know, you got to do it as a comic. You gotta Brody Stevens is the master. Oh yeah. Brody's the master of the warmup. He's got it down to a science. Dawn Buress is awesome at it as well. Yeah, yeah. There's guys that get it down. They get it down to a science, you know? Absolutely. Brody would have you call and asking him to repeat jokes, but me and Brody used to did the laundromats together like, and to make you Martin Chavez in New York City, we used to do laundry mats at that and Andrew Donnelly, I remember that. Those were like the anchor. Donnelley had the funniest joke. He's at the laundromat doing comedy. He goes to the dryer, he goes, let me put this on no career.

Speaker 3:          01:12:03       There was a, um, uh, episode of opiate Anthony where they were talking about New York comedians and the how, how the difference between the New York comedians and the west coast comedian sits in New York. Comedians are fucking brutally mean, knew each other. Oh yeah. All the time. Constantly fucking with each other. But it's like, it's expected and appreciated. It's like fun. The one time I used to play basketball with like Kevin Hart, Patrice O'Neal, Rich Vos, Jim Norton, right. Uh, and I was like, you guys were playing basketball at three o'clock in the morning. They called me and called me open mic. You open mic. They passed me the ball. I was open. Like, he like Keith Robinson, I mean all of these. So one time I, three in the morning, they were playing basketball in your clock in the morning and we'd always play basketball. And Kevin Hart was sick. He lied everyone up.

Speaker 3:          01:12:50       He was the best one by like by far, I mean three in the morning, three o'clock in the morning. We would find some, I used to go to the comedy cellar, I wasn't like past about it. Hang out there and then go play basketball. I'd go with the Condo, had basketball. Right. So what ended up happening was, um, one time, uh, Steve Marcel is a funny New York comedian. Like he's a really funny guy. He goes, what if as a gang here, what are you going to do? We went back without our tape recorders and then Jim Norton goes, press play it. They'll run.

Speaker 3:          01:13:21       That was like, that is a funny, I couldn't believe it was like right on fucking queue. I was like, dude, that's a, that's a brain that like that I admire, man. I should have Norton tool areas. He's, he's made like single handedly trannies. Okay. To talk about. It's okay to talk about your training experiences singlehandedly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's funny as hell, man. He's an animal. I love that guy. That whole opiod. Anthony Shell. So the best show on radio, that's the consistently hilarious, fucked up. Weird and Norton consistently makes me laugh. He's so funny. He's just so fucking crazy. Yeah, he's so off the deep end. Crazy. He's fun though. That east coast sense of comraderies different too. This like more camaraderie.

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       I think amongst comics

Speaker 5:          01:14:13       it's east coast comedians a lot of times it's like that's all they want is common. You know West Coast Comedians, sometimes people like they're, they do comedy but they also act, they produce, you know

Speaker 6:          01:14:24       something, you know. Yeah. They're trying to get something in show business so to just trying to be a comic, they're trying to be famous. There's a lot of that, you know, we've all seen those guys that go up there. I don't even really commerce and kind of actors and so then they just sort of act like a comic, which is nothing wrong with that. I mean w

Speaker 5:          01:14:40       I get more mad at the audience for laughing at it. Like I don't get mad. I get disappointed. I'm like, this is what you guys find funny. And then I go, maybe I'm not funny cause this is what they're laughing at you.

Speaker 6:          01:14:48       Well if you never been to comedy before and you know, you're not like sophisticated in the ways of the hack joke. Yeah. Someone could catch you. Yeah. You can just go there. Especially when you're young.

Speaker 5:          01:15:00       Let's dive in. The hack joke that bothers me. It's like, at least there's a joke in the hack joke. It's like the act out, look how talented I am. [inaudible] scream this method work for somebody else. So now I'm going to do it. You know,

Speaker 6:          01:15:13       guy that I came up with [inaudible] he was, he was ahead of me a little bit by a few years, but he um, he had like a, or was a weird act. It was like a completely contrived act. Like everything about him was contrived. Like he would wear like a jacket that had like a, like a gas station attendant jacket, but he didn't work in a gas station. You know, he would, he would, he had a like a look and then he had like an act and this act that he was piecing together. I went and saw him before when I was a, before I'd ever done stand up. I was thinking about doing standup. So I went to see some comedy punched times and I saw him and he made me laugh. I thought it was funny, like a couple of things. I thought it was really funny. Then I started doing comedy and then once I started doing comedy I realized, Oh, this kind of sucks. Yeah. I thought it was funny, like I thought just like a year ago that you were funny. Yeah. And then you realize all the mechanics behind everything and you know, like what he's doing. It's just like really clunky, overused bullshit. No heart behind it. No real point of view is kind of a dick in real life feel like, oh

Speaker 5:          01:16:15       yeah, that happened. That that's happening before. Like especially, uh, the first guy I ever opened for on the road after that prom show, this Guy Jack, this guy, Jim and I, he's an asshole. He's a fucking, his name was Jim and I asked him and he's a white guy. I get a phone call. Yeah, I got a phone call from this, from this book, or he goes, guess what? I got you booked in South Carolina, you know, it's going to be amazing. But I'm like, oh, this is great myrtle beach. So the next thing I know a giant like van pulls up with this guy, Jim and I, and there's a black, he had this like black puppet named sunny, right? Like a lifestyle. And, and he hit a Dick Puppet. Like he had, you know, they'd say, oh, the guy's got to dig puppet. He actually had a dick puppet.

Speaker 5:          01:16:52       Right. Like swear to God. So I like go in this van and we would drive to Cassie's comedy club. And I'm like, oh, we, we're like, we should stop off in Baltimore or something on the way and they're doing this like holiday and with all black people, he moves out the black puppet and I'm like, we're going to fucking die. Like they're gonna kill him, you know? Wow. But it was actually pretty funny. Moral story is, yeah, he did Dick Bucket. But he told me a funny story that this actually goes somewhere. He was saying that he was driving with Sony, the black pop at one time. And, uh, he got a van and got caught on fire, got no car accident and he like, he was sitting there watching the van burned down and all these kids are there and he's like, people that are watching this. He goes, oh my God, my fucking puppet jumps inside. Everyone thinks he's rescued this black kid because he's carrying it and he's carrying the head right and it's so burned down, it falls down and he starts throwing his voice going. It's okay. I'm all right.

Speaker 3:          01:17:45       I know. It was a funny story. I wanted to share the story. Uh, it's probably the best story I've ever heard. Fuck man, that was so bad. I was trying to, I was trying to and strong on that. This is why I'm good at Twitter. Sorry Dude. He swung the mess, man. It happens to the best of us. We've all been there. Come on. Okay. I told the story last week to someone, they were like, you got to tell a story on the fucking, did you follow it completely, Brian? Uh, most of it. Yeah, I wrote it out. Okay. I have it written. I will send you the story. If anyone wants to story, I'll email them the story of how it really went down. Sounds pretty important.

Speaker 5:          01:18:25       Yeah. Yeah. What else going on?

Speaker 3:          01:18:29       Can we transition out of this? This is a part of the podcast where people click onto the Adam Carolla podcast. It's also available in light, dude. Fuck man. Be In this year.

Speaker 5:          01:18:40       Uh, I went and they have a dog. No, I went to AVN last year.

Speaker 3:          01:18:44       For the people at home that aren't freaks is the porn awards. What's the separate look? Look at it. How fucked up these two guys are. My story and it's so casual. So like, yeah. Yeah. You want to go to AVN? You're to go down there. Probably go down there. Thank you for rescuing that story, but there's no fucking way what's right. You know what we were talking about too. But the folks at home, like a lot of people like don't know what the avms are. Adult video news or words, uh, porn awards and it's from C, like ces used to be on the same weekend and he used to be the ultimate place cause it'd be like the porn awards on one floor and then the nerd awards on the other floor that stop. I think it was just too awesome. I don't know. It's too awesome. The universe couldn't handle it right.

Speaker 5:          01:19:38       Last year. Uh, cause I was doing comedy that week at the La Comedy Club and uh, it was, um, me and uh, I went there last year was if it was fun, it was a little crate. It wasn't as crazy. Haven't, you know, anytime to everyone

Speaker 3:          01:19:50       knows about something. It's never as good as if no one really knows about it. You know, like everyone's like, oh, oh, AVN awards, everyone's all these like guys like the paid that like, are expecting something crazy to happen, which never happens. It's always like the parties and no one knows about that. That's like the swinger shit goes on or the, yeah,

Speaker 6:          01:20:08       yeah, yeah. But, uh, the AVN awards chill. Everybody's in bed by eight. Yeah. They all got their, their toes with little cotton in between them and they're reading the book. They wild as fuck and electronics. People are just on math, raging face. Fucking

Speaker 2:          01:20:40       January 17th it's an APM. It's a part of the AVN package, I guess you buy packages. Like he just, Hey, do you want VIP to all these clubs and parties, you know, one day, two days, three days. And so we're doing it and it's actually sponsored by Avn. I guess it's going to be a vinyl though,

Speaker 6:          01:21:22       Yeah. Having his own show now. Is that what's going on? It's just MDF talking shit. Just talking shit with other, yeah, but he's keeping the whole talking shit. Yeah. Why not? Just the idea of show. Okay. It doesn't have to be talking to shit. I ended up talking shit and got him in so much. Well, so like that's my, my website is um, uh, Joe Rogan. Dot Nat and I have a message board on the message boards. Shit, talking one on one. It's one of the forums and it's always been shit talking one on one, it puts, it doesn't really mean you're supposed to go and talk shit, you know, it just, it's like, what are you doing? I would just shooting the shit, you know, like shit talking. So it became shit talking one on one. Like if anybody says like, Hey, you know, these guys were online and they said something and it was, I really found it offensive and uh, I found that disturbing than anybody would laugh at that.

Speaker 6:          01:22:14       Oh yeah. What was the forum you were on? What was called shit talking one on one. I'll come on you silly bitch like w w how could you be complaining about something that you read on? Shit. Talking one on one. Take nothing seriously here. Consider consider all that you bang, but take nothing seriously here. It's called shit talking one on one. It sounds good to me, but talking shit as a podcast, I feel like that's, you're really committed to that. They're talking shit. Yeah, exactly. You don't have to the whole podcast. I totally agree. How about just the idea of show, what's it make a plea. Let's, let's try to contact ATF and steer him towards the light. It's not possible for him.

Speaker 2:          01:22:55       He's funny, man. I got to see him in a where was that? San Francisco or Oregon or

Speaker 6:          01:22:59       San Francisco. He was a, when we were at that Masonic Hall theater place and he was over at the punch on

Speaker 9:          01:23:06       it. Yeah. Was really funny. Yeah. That's fucking awesome, man. The punchline is awesome. Hey FB and B, we have to work there. ADF inside. Now we did at college one time though that at Penn state. And uh, it was outside like 300 people. It was like the worst gig ever. And he's like on the flagpole telling jokes and there were crickets in the back and he goes, well, there's only so you can actually hear the actual crickets. Actual crickets. Yeah. I'm trying to think of all the fucking crazy shows up done outside. I did one on a college. It was outside in the muddle platform at night. Oh, you have a big fish, big fish.

Speaker 5:          01:23:48       I think it's in Glendale and it's right next to a train track. And the whole time the owner and the bartender just heckles you. And then every five minutes like a train goes by, it's like the worst. Ah, one of the, one of the worst things I ever did was opening up for too short the wrapper short dog in England in England that, can we talk about it now? Oakland? Yeah.

Speaker 10:         01:24:14       No, no, no. Hey Man, meet me in Oklahoma. Came and meet me in England. They have totally different meanings. I know it wasn't England, but, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:24:22       fuck dude, I'm on the, I'm not supposed to do a ton of Gemini in Monterrey and I'm driving and it says, uh, uh, I thought like, wait at the Gig and listen to the radio station like tonight, two shorts playing and I'm fucking, I'm like, I'm supposed to be there. That's kind of weird, right? So I, I like go on and they're like, oh, we have you opening for too short. No one's here to see me. It's just me swear. And it's all like, it's me, Milton and, and, and too short. Right. So I'm just like cursing after every joke that way they'll like laugh sort of, you know, like it doesn't ever work. It's sort of, yeah, right.

Speaker 9:          01:24:54       Didn't even realize that you're, um, you're trying too hard. You're trying too hard in front of a black crowd. They will not tolerate that shit. Absolutely are white crowd would try to be kind and work with you. Black people paid money to hear you talk and the fee, you know, funny and get the fuck off the stage. That's, and once they start billing, you cannot return. There's no pulling out of that. Oh, she didn't. You don't, you don't pull out of that fucking crash. Get off the stage, but lightly with the fine. How do you do and get out of there. Yeah. This one. So then, uh,

Speaker 5:          01:25:24       too short goes on and he does like three songs. Like, man, you got to get paid. You got to get paid. It was, you know what? I'm not doing any more songs. Let you guys give me $2,000 right to the crowd. Yeah. Yeah. There's like a hundred people there and some people like passing around a bucket. Oh, come on. I swear. And then there's no way I'm telling you like that is the craziest Shit I've ever heard.

Speaker 10:         01:25:45       Betty goes, I ain't, I'm not going to do no more songs. Less you guys. Can we choose a raise like 50 bucks or something, right? Oh my God. That is so funny. So then right, so then he goes, all right, you

Speaker 5:          01:26:01       know what I want to sperm swallowers blow me on

Speaker 3:          01:26:04       stage. Right? Why? I swear I swear to God. So then these two fat white chicks go, he goes, I said sperm swallow, it was best for him. Whales. Right. So then then the whole crowd starts fucking fighting, right? Like I have a whole crowd but like ha like a lot of people that are throwing bottles and finding him at each other because the lights go on. The cops like conscious over and it was just one of those things where it like a fight cop said the concert over cause we want to get blown on the two o'clock in the morning. It was like it started an hour late. It was one of those stands or punch a cock blockers. Okay. If he actually got blown on stage, do anything when it made the story so much better. But all of a sudden your watch that guy rapping bone over because it was like over.

Speaker 3:          01:26:44       But, but yeah that would be funny. If it's like an old man that would've been sensational. So then write a fucking, there's like people bleeding. It was crazy shit. I'm just watching all this right. The next day I come back to the club and the owner was like, hey man, you would too dirty last night. Shut the fuck. I swear to God I'm do dirty. What about the fucking riot fucking happen at your club? It was fucking crazy. That's hilarious. Well, I think what he was saying is that you know you were offensive by swearing after every choke. I know what a silly goose here you can see that he was obviously he'd be like, we have, obviously we have other problems as well. There was a bit of a problem with you Adam,

Speaker 1:          01:27:28       running a tight ship, imaginative to shortlist those big girls blown on stage. Yeah. It was crazy. You could have been there to watch. That would've been a psychological experiment, man. That's that to be there live. While that happens, that's like being in the back of a jeep while you're watching a lion take out a gazelle. Looks like you watch it. Like real nature in a strange form right there. Can I did too short and too fat white women just, yeah. Then he was like so picky. If you want to get someone to blow you off.

Speaker 3:          01:27:58       Did you really want it first

Speaker 1:          01:28:01       step up. You don't want the one who's thinking hard but not sure and well he just made fun of those girls. I'm not going up now you don't. You don't want that. You supposed to take the first soldiers, the ones, but then again they could have been like a really hot girl behind them, but those fabric just pushed her out of the way. Intimidation and the sheer bulk to get to two short. Somebody got arrested for getting blown during a concert. I think it was Luke from two live crew. It was, it was it. Yeah. That's pretty gangster. Look that up. Find out if that's true. Can you look that up? Is it Luke? Yeah. What's the penalty for that? Kevin? Blow on stage. Public display of play of

Speaker 3:          01:28:46       awesome. This the greatest comic, like if I'm having grown on stage while I'm telling like my therapy jokes would have been great if it was a video of it and yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:28:53       couldn't get hard. He was like, I just don't understand why it just never happened.

Speaker 3:          01:28:58       Well, jobs happen all the time at the comedy store. On stage. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:29:02       definitely onstage. That is soaker and it's a lot of it's guys. That's how hard is the path there now guys are blowing guys now just for stage time. That's the worst. That was the only way to get onstage to, it'd be dude too would do it. There'd be dudes who would say, hey, you know, I don't like it, but you know, part of the job, it just fucking buckled strapped down at Sarc Cock sucker car cloak. Figuratively, you know, only literally, I mean in my real love making my own decisions. That's of the crossover over poetry. Like when that's not working, just being a funny poet. Have you ever seen slam poetry? The snapping, but when people start snapping, I'm like, well I can't do all the audience. Their staffing when they like it. They do that at pool halls too. I don't know. That's cool.

Speaker 9:          01:29:49       That pool halls, a guy makes a good shot. He'd do a little of that. Let them know Dan or you tap your queue on the ground. You're literally killed. Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. We'll let them know, but that's some inside shit that you wouldn't be aware of. Sun. I actually met my friend who's a a porn star. T real right. I was like this black guy. I'm like, Hey man, you and your buddy ever double came a chick. Isn't that kind of weird if you have to do that, you know like two guys, he's like, it just like sports. You've got to pull your position. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah. There was a dude that um, uh, was telling us about this was like pre viagara days. This dude was telling us it's about keeping your edge. And I was like, what do you mean?

Speaker 9:          01:30:27       Like keep your hands cause you know, keep your heart on man because you've got to keep your edge. And I'm like, what do you mean by like your edge? He goes, just like, it's a mindset man mindset. You got to keep that mindset cause sometimes it's doing shit you don't want to do. I might go like, like Dick's touching decks. He's like, you know, ah Yup. When you do a double penetration seen, okay, you're not doing it in different dimensions. Okay. You both inside the vagina and the reality is when two dudes are having sex with a woman at the same time it's, you know, you just use in her vagina as a container so that you could rub dicks. That's what it is. You rubbing your Dick's together. That's not sex. I mean it is kind of sexual. You're like holding it there, but you just got to get off on that dude's warm slippery deck, that warm Dick next to your Dick and you got to somehow or another, it's keep your heart on it now like when I was there, but I'm going to Florida, this chick that I bang on time, it was like my friend let me bang her.

Speaker 9:          01:31:23       She's like Bob and you and you do and this guy at once. I'm like, oh what a good kid. So I was like, I was trying to be a good friend. I'm like, you know what are, and then I couldn't get hard. I was like, I can't like go think guy in the room. And I couldn't do it because it was like, well, he'd probably gang gang because you couldn't get out of it. You're fighting it so much that you're, you know, you're in denial. They bothers you so much. And I came up the next week. It was actually, it was as good then I, then I got fucked everybody after that. It just fucking, uh, a big line of people. I just blew the whole, the whole Florida. Well if you, if you're like passing by those gay clubs on Santa Monica, there's

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       a lot of times where I'm like, you know, like these people look like they have more fun than anybody. Like I'm, I'm, I'm not in the act, but they are, and they look like they're having a good time. It's a fascinating thing. And wonder what it was that made the transition were gay became homosexual because it wasn't during the Flintstones days. During the Flintstones days. It was, we have a gay old time. So back then, that's what we know is a cultural point of reference back then. Gay Men, we're going to have a grand isle when gay. Wonderful 10. They were having so much fun. It was a gay old time. Yeah, that makes sense. That's what meant Flintstones meets the front, you know that was in the fucking song. We'll have a gay right.

Speaker 5:          01:32:43       The Flintstones. You think the song was made for Gail time as a no.

Speaker 1:          01:32:48       What I mean is when did it switch, when did it become homosexual? When did, uh, when did it, when did it, when did gay become a slang for homosexual? To the point where it's like accepted as a like nomenclature gay. It's like you know, lesbian, gay, Bi, transgender. Like Ge is in there for gay, you know, instead of homosexual it's gay. Whereas at one point in time, but it's amazing because gay became like the actual like common term for it

Speaker 5:          01:33:19       everyday of day. Are we having so much fun that they had the suck a cock and then it became gay.

Speaker 1:          01:33:24       It's one of the few names for someone that somehow or another they just enjoyed an incorporated to the point where it's a commonly accepted term for it. For Gay only. For homosexual. Gay is the, there's nothing offensive about calling a homosexual person gay. But if you look back at gay, gay used to mean something else. Yeah. And then somehow or another it became gay, but to the point or it became a homosexual. But it be to the point of it being the way to say it, it's not offensive at all. Gay people use it. Oh, I'm gay. You know, they, they'll use it that way. And it's not an offense of terminology. It's not, I'm homosexual. I say I'm gay, but it never ever got bad. You know? It's not like, oh, I'm a faggot. You're like, Whoa, oh dude, don't say that about yourself. Don't use that term. Right. Don't use that thinking. You know, but gay is not that gay is just homosexual to the point where it's actually on. Like, you know, you could sign things, so are you gay? You have to like, it's weird. It's weird how that one got accepted. Like it's okay.

Speaker 5:          01:34:22       I'm just happy that it's now like, like during the kitchen, I'll say to a gay pride parade, it doesn't offend people. That's the worst. When you can't, you say gay something. Yeah. That's like as a comic it's just brutal and you have to like, gays are silly and should be able to make fun of him. There's a lot of fun in there. Or just or just say gay pride parade. It's not making fun of it. Like the joke was like I was at the Gay Pride Parade, uh, at in New York who was the Puerto Rican Day parade in the Gay Pride Parade. Ricky Martin left 127 miles because he's both gay and Puerto Rican. Right. And I'm happy. That's very funny. But I'm happy that I could say that at a kid show. It's not offensive. It's the worst when you have to, Oh, you can't say gay around kids. It's like why not?

Speaker 1:          01:34:59       I think it's pretty clear that the standards for what's offensive are changing because of the Internet. It's pretty, pretty obvious. You know, I point a fear factor. I'll look. When I first started doing it too, when when I first started doing, it was like 2002 to what they tried to get us to do in 2011 is a very completely different level of acceptance. Like they were trying to get him to drink, come, you know, they, they, they did it. They drank jugs of com did that would have never flown before the Internet. There is no fucking way. No,

Speaker 5:          01:35:32       I love the sons of anarchy and breaking bad and decks another Dexter the kite cable. But I love the fact that I chose that I could actually watch and not feel like they're always like, I feel like in comedy in life, it's always that the one person, it's never the 99 people. It's like, oh, one guy wrote a letter. Well what about the 300 people to show who didn't? Oh, all the one person were to letter. It's like you always have to paint it to that person. And I think it's like, oh, so many people like, oh. It's like, well, it was anybody offended? No. Okay, we're fine. Not that everyone laugh. It's

Speaker 1:          01:36:01       nobody was offended. You know what they want to try to do is they want to be edgy and they want to take chances but they don't want to fall and so then you're not at gene, you're not taking chances. So you'll never get ahead g and you never going to get chances on something like, you know, mainstream talk shows like the tonight show is pretty squeaky except for, you know what? Uh, Norton actually said that his sets on the tonight show, he, they give him more leeway.

Speaker 5:          01:36:26       I did that joke on him. I don't want to get a bunch of jokes that like, they're like fine, they're getting more Norton risque, risque, which is great because it's like they have to, because otherwise I'm not entertained. I'm not, I'm not going to laugh at a sitcom that like, I know the jokes are true

Speaker 1:          01:36:41       written for a 12 year old or a conservative housewife. It's not going to make me laugh. They, and that is a form of programming to, it doesn't seem like it is, but for really stupid people it is when you give them mundane thoughts on mundane art and Monday and comedy in this water down bullshit over and over again and they accept it. It's dulling, it's dulling because it's like you're, you're just watching it cause he keeps moving and it keeps being on there keeps being things that are, that you could follow but you're not getting any satisfaction of following these things. So when you're watching like really dull stupid thoughts that are being exhibited in, in the shows, it's like dulling your, your like your reality is so fucking boring and you're so miss directed that you're actually sitting there watching an artificial reality that's infinitely more boring than the actual reality you live in. I bet you're locked in watching this stupid fake dad with his stupid fake argument with a stupid fake wife, and you're watching these two knuckleheads going back and forth with this artificial resolution doesn't make any sense and the real world. Well, you know, we've got to keep this family together and like, yeah, that's how fuck you're breaking people's brains with that horse shit. When you, you make people watch stuff like that. Yeah. You're pumping shit thoughts into their pea brains and it's sloshes around in there and everything.

Speaker 5:          01:38:07       Oh, that's why I get upset when you say the hacky conduct makes a joke and they laugh because I think that that, back to that of like they're laughing at what they've been trained to laugh at, which is bullshit.

Speaker 1:          01:38:17       Sometimes the laugh and just had a rhythm. You know, there's a, there was a lot of comics, especially in the 80s that weren't funny at all. They just had, they would say funny in a funny way with a rhythm. Yeah. Yeah. And then somehow or another, they thought that that was a word. Some of these guys.

Speaker 5:          01:38:31       Yeah. Now who like, Oh, I did Carson at that letter. Yeah. And just like a man,

Speaker 1:          01:38:37       the creativity, you know, that's the one for a lot of folks is the most difficult aspect of it. The creativity, the ability to create pits, the ability to come up with stuff that's relevant and funny.

Speaker 5:          01:38:47       Brian Cowen, I called him up one day and counselor, you've been like kind of a mentor to me and he's like, oh, someone's going to fucking hit the rock like the cabins one day. I'm like hell. And I didn't get Montreal. My manager left me, I got thrown off last time, whatever I was telling him and he's like, Bro, put your head down and write. That's just keep working. Don't, and that's to me what I have to remind myself to do is just have tunnel vision of like don't worry about what everyone else is doing and everyone else who's succeeding. And that's the hardest part for me is to like actually do that.

Speaker 1:          01:39:22       Yeah. That's why what we were talking about earlier about, you know, you were like, when do you have the time to look at all these different things? And read all these different things. Well those are the things that are interesting to me because I don't have to worry about that other stuff anymore. And when you don't have to worry about like, you know, if they're constantly scramble and warrior like what's going to happen with my career? Where am I going to be in a year from now? Am I going to be able to pay my bills? When that shit's out of the way, you can just concentrate on things that you find interesting. And oddly enough, I'm more productive that way than I ever was. You know, in a way where I was just trying to be productive, you know, and concentrating on that instead of concentrating on the actual stuff I'm doing. But now, now, because I can concentrate on the actual stuff I'm doing, whether it's podcasts or writing comedy or working for the UFC, I can concentrate only on that stuff.

Speaker 5:          01:40:07       Yeah, that's what I'm, that's the, that's the one thing about like the shifts or whatever, like the downtime to create is like, like I've finally like, you know, finished two scripts. You're going to sell those. Sold a TV show to, uh, to fuel a couple of months ago.

Speaker 1:          01:40:22       It's awesome. Congratulations. Oh Bang. If you will actually just got some cable award for being the fastest growing channel on cable in 2012. They gained more, more viewers on 2012. They didn't take it out, but that's how I sold it to them. It's a lot of it. I think the UFC, cause it's so much fights on great over there. It's fucking incredible. You Watch fuel most most days there's fights on and it's like basically like the fucking UFC now.

Speaker 5:          01:40:47       It is beautiful. And uh, and now I'm like producing another show, you know, and then working

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       on, you know, like I did Leno, that was cool. So this is constantly working and I'll kind of get the enemy roasted bigger cause I think it's like, well this is a huge market for MMA fans now and to have like a strict humor site. There's a few guys that do like Tommy Toehold Avila. Yeah, he's fine. Hilarious man. Those, those things are fucking hilarious. And, uh, you know, there's a few other sites that have done like animations and stuff like that. They're really funny people are the memes people. Oh yeah. The animated Gif make me laugh. Or even like, like someone over right. A post to the thread and I'll look down and the guy takes like an 80s, 1950s movie. He goes, get out, get out, get out with the word, get out. This is like, oh my God. It was a picture of me at the Wayans came to Alaska to dos Santos and I, when I'm at the weigh ins, see for folks who, uh, like put it in perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:41:51       All right. For me, uh, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a huge fight fan. I've always been a fight fan my whole life. It's pretty obvious anybody sees me do or he listens to me rather do commentary. I don't have to fake, like, whether or not I'm excited about that, that is, um, about, oh, I've always been obsessed with it. Uh, with the sport of mixed martial arts, it's um, you know, to me it's the moment of the way in is a really special aspect of that because these guys, they're going to circle around each other and the hotels and the lobbies and they might shake cans even they might post for picture even they might have to do some press shit together and they've been thinking about nothing but each other for six, eight weeks, even more, you know, I mean for some dudes, so they're scheduling big fights months in advance, right?

Speaker 1:          01:42:39       And then they're standing there and they get off that scale and they stepped towards each other and hold their knuckles in front of each other. And they know that in less than 24 hours, so a little bit more than 24 hours actually they're going to throw down like all this shit is coming to an end tomorrow. And that moment right there is so intense. You looking over at junior dos Santos, he's a fucking killer. He knocked Cain Velasquez down in 64 fucking seconds the first time. They mean, and then you see Cain, who before that everybody thought was the baddest motherfucker on two wheels and it was going to be a really hard beat. That guy, everybody was thinking, can't just going to put that wrestling pace on you. Keep shooting those doubles until you were out and then hammer fist you into oblivion. And that's what he did to Jr. But before this fight, man, you know, you looked at the two of them and there was so much on the line, the UFC heavyweight title and the fact that he had not cane out in the first round, the first fight, and when Cain raised his knuckle up to juniors face the same way junior does, and they're just both stood, stood their ground like that.

Speaker 1:          01:43:39       Woo. God Damn, there's some fucking energy in that room. You're, you're like, this is going to be some epic shit tomorrow. The two of them just staring at each other. No one Blinken the two best

Speaker 9:          01:43:52       heavyweights on the planet, right enough fucking throw bombs. That's a funny video. Funny.

Speaker 10:         01:43:58       Oh my God. They took that picture and put it on everything. I was a, I was coming out of women's Vaginas,

Speaker 5:          01:44:04       it's dying. I was uh, that's like, to me that's the thing about like the great thing about Emmy roasted. Is that

Speaker 5:          01:44:11       like half to the fans are wrestlers or did you do to people even more? It's like I can never get those people like, like whatever in a room. But in the, on this thing that's like all these can I see the belts are and the geese and like I'm doing jokes that like no one's going to get, but those people or I mean UFC fans like I'm like, you know, you know your watch too much MMA when your girlfriend friends like to Banger and you pass your guard and people like, and people laugh at that because they get it, you know? But if I did that on the stage would be like, what the what? What's pastor guard? What are you talking about? You know? So I feel like I'm speaking a language that only see these people speak, which is pretty cool.

Speaker 9:          01:44:45       You could open up my show and people would understand about 99% would understand what pastor gardening is. Probably.

Speaker 5:          01:44:50       Yeah. I mean that's like a, to me that's, that's the cool thing is that I'm able to communicate with people that I never thought I'd be able to communicate with because there were actually guys would I wrestle, they wrestled or I did this or I train. They train. You know like I love UFC. They love UFC.

Speaker 9:          01:45:04       What's it called again? I don't know what happened. Fuck man. That out. That is a beautiful thing about the internet. The fact that, look at this dude, that is the funniest thing.

Speaker 10:         01:45:19       Pictures are ridiculous. Beautiful thing about the Internet. It said it kicked, it creates, these are really finally, it creates some fucking, forget what I'm saying. Fuck it. It creates communities. Wrestlers can find each other. You can find each other. You know people that are in the comedy or people are in the fucking whatever it is. Some of these people, is that a real photo? Pull up. Pull that up. The one, how many different nutty things that guy see that fucking guy, the

Speaker 9:          01:45:57       the go bus people for. Uh, what the fuck is his name again?

Speaker 10:         01:46:02       Chris Hansen. Chris Hardwick. He says no, Chris Hardwick is the Nerdist you son of a bitch.

Speaker 9:          01:46:07       Chris Hansen. Um, Chris Hardwick's. Good guy. How dare you? How dare you? Um, Krista answered how much fucked up shit that that guy say. I mean that guy saw like one child rapist after another over and over and over again.

Speaker 5:          01:46:21       The guys. So unlikable you almost route for the Predator, right? There's something about that guy that like you ended up, he's a creepy dude. Yeah. Yeah. The guy from cheaters and hen both. And have you do a show where you go around Boston people?

Speaker 9:          01:46:32       Well, Bob Dunkin interviewed the guy from cheaters recently. He said it was a really good podcast. He said the guy was surprisingly smart. I'm sure. Said it was really interesting. Oh, you want me just putting it out there? No, I'm serious. Probably was mine. I think a lot of that show was bullshit too. Like big, big stab. It was that Bro. Yeah. You think so? Yeah. Um, man, I don't think you're allowed to fix damage. They would have to be like a police record on a past podcast. It's really ridiculous. Really think it's fake. Yeah. But I think you went to the hospital. No. Brian calls fake and everything though. He's right a lot though. He gets it right. A lot. A lot of fake shit on the Internet. Okay. Don't be fooled out of hunter. Uh, no, it's true. So these videos that you're doing, how many of those are you gonna do

Speaker 3:          01:47:19       and they arrested? Yeah. Uh, I'm going to keep putting it out there. I mean, I love it. You know, I love doing it. It's fun. I wish they got more heads. Uh, everybody wishes they were more successful at a monitor. I, everybody wishes it got more hits. Everybody wishes their tweets were read by more. I know, I know. There are a lot of time wishing. I wish it would pick it a well or something. Uh, but yeah, I'm going to keep doing them. And I, I enjoy, I enjoy watching the fights and you're having a reason to why is fades and, uh, I'm, I'm producing a pilot now. Hopefully the EOC will, it's gonna you know where it's like a Kelsey lately, but about Mia. Really? Oh, that's funny. And it's a, and me and a triple, you're working on it and Joey Varner, so we'll just go, it's going to be great. That's interesting because it really is only alert couple of Emily's shows, no comedy shows, like there's funny aspects of shows, but there's no strictly content. So I think this will be good because you do the topics in a day and a monologue on the spike show. The bald guy. Yeah. He isn't he like, he's not a comedian or is it radio has to be like either radio guy by the, he think he's trying to be like, uh, the guy in ESPN who's trying to be like the grumpy, disgruntled Fan.

Speaker 3:          01:48:29       I watch some of this stuff. It was a little bit like I wouldn't, I would take a different path. You know, I, I try not to be disrespectful ever. Well that's a sports guy thing. A lot of those soft sports guys like the shit all over the players and they've never played anything. Never. I mean I think because I mean I'm not saying I got to go to high level wrestling, but I didn't get to like high level wrestling, you know, what does that mean? So you just contradicted yourself. I won the New England's a prep school four years in a row. I was only the third person, never do it. And then I, I won the all New England twice and then got a scholarship to a hospital typically by Tom Ryan. But I didn't take it. I went to bank so I've got to a high level but I didn't get to a high level like the Olympics.

Speaker 3:          01:49:07       The Olympics are Nash Division One e three for like a semester. You know, I get to like a year. I favor Johny Hendricks. And that's a, that's a different level. What's the, what do you think separates a guy like Johnny Hendricks? Like, oh, a real high level guy who was very successful as an amateur wrestler. What do you think separates him from, from other like it like I look like I take Rockhold is something who is very high level wrestler but didn't but didn't succeed UFC sort of is that no, no, no, no. I mean what's the difference between a guy like that and uh, you know, a, a d three wrestler or a guy who's not, you know, not to offend any d three wrestlers cause I don't, I'd have to be careful with this because some of them are talented to your tough

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       with some of our super top right. 72. I mean it's like Cain car, it's your car. One was a dick at d two wrestler or a d three maybe. Then Phd too, you know, and some of the got Connor hewn and the friend of mine was a d three wrestler and you're tough as hell. I just think d one it's just a, it's the practices are probably the better caliber

Speaker 1:          01:50:07       one. It's essentially, if you want to be a competitive wrestler and you were in high school, you look for a d one college

Speaker 5:          01:50:14       versus a d three college limbic team or something. The reason I chose Binghamton for me was I was like, well, I don't want to take up my whole life but I still want to wrestle so I don't want to have it all year round. I don't want to do it a couple months out of the year and I still want to write. But it was still my whole life. It was like once I got there, because it's the kind of sport you're as good as you want to be. It's your whole life, you know? So, but I would say like, uh, like Matt Hamill start off with a d one wrestler placed on the all new hurricane went d three, I think he wanted like two years in a row or three years ago. So it just, it's a harder level, you know, it's a better, but a guy like Johnny Hendricks, why are we on this?

Speaker 5:          01:50:53       What was the difference? Like, Oh yeah, that makes a guy, I mean just more, more hours of practice. That's all it is, you think? I think so. I mean, cause some of those you got to go with, well what testament of like wills, how much did they love it too? You know, like I loved wrestling, but I also love the attention that I was getting in high school from it because it was a small school when I was a big star, big fish in a small pond. When I got to college, no one really gave a fuck about wrestling. It was like one of those sports except for the wrestlers and a couple of groupies. But it wasn't like, it wasn't like I was in high school, so I miss being that star kind of. And I was like, well it's not gonna be the star. Yeah. Oh really? That's funny. What a needy bitch you are. I hate to, I hate to admit this, I mean

Speaker 1:          01:51:37       freshing Lee, honest and in a normal way of thinking too, by the way, you know, nobody wants to do something where they, I mean there's a lot of people that are doing sports at a very obscure and they have like an inferiority complex about that. You know, like you ever talked to someone who does like an obscure sport and they're like, they put a call out, we play three cushioned billiards or stuff like that and want to tell you how awesome it is. You know? It's a, it's, it's weird. They like have like insecurities.

Speaker 5:          01:52:01       Oh yeah. Well that's the thing. I think anytime. I think any time you were an athlete though, and you'd like, to me, I was, I felt like an average kid, but then when I got wrestling I was, all of a sudden it's something made me special. Right. You know, and I need, then you don't rest it more to like, to me, I didn't feel special anymore, you know? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:52:17       And you know what, that's, I'm going, I'm going to call genedy bitch. You know, I'm only talking around because I was exactly the same way, uh, 100% the same way. Um, and growing up when I started doing martial arts, it was the only time I ever felt like I was worth anything. Like, because everything else that I had done, I mean, I was when I was like 15 years old when I got serious about martial arts. But other than that, anything else I had done. It was just like art, like artistic stuff. But I didn't know if there was any future in that. I didn't know. Like I, I thought it was a loser, you know? So getting good at something,

Speaker 6:          01:52:46       anything. It was like what gave me my identity. Yeah. You know, I think that happens for a lot of guys, especially guys like you or I that grew up without, you know, one of our family members. You know,

Speaker 5:          01:52:57       I, the good thing about wrestling though, for me it was that not to knock a water polo or another obscure sport, but is that it really did teach you cap out character. Like, Holy Fuck, well I'm sure water polo would teach a character too. Right.

Speaker 6:          01:53:10       But there's a different level. There's a different level. The level of, uh, not just tenacity, but the ability to endure hardship and the ability to overcome uncomfortable situations. I know a lot of wrestlers from highschool that fucked her body up in high school, man, dehydrated themselves to the point they look like zombies are walking around and couldn't eat in the wrong way. Class is getting pummeled on, on the mat because of it. Every day I watched these guys, like I watched a dude who was assault brought all his brothers like six, two, six one six two big giant guy. He's like five, five, five, six. That's I, I'm sure I did that like, cause he was constantly dieting

Speaker 5:          01:53:46       that though the way cut though. Like they, you know, I would be 18 pounds one week before the match. Yeah. And then it was like, okay, just eating to strictly salad, not even anything else. Yeah. It spitting in a cup all day, sleeping with the windows, open the shiver off, wait while you sleep. Um, putting in the heat up to like 110 and then and then try and put as much layers on so that I would like sweat. And then a couple of kids my year died from jump everything in the, in the shower with the steam on, they passed out fucking Christ. So uh, yeah that was, that was brutal. But that to me when, when I used to call in the match at the college, the 10 matches I had, because that's what kind of wanted to prove that the restaurant, the college level and then stop in some ways.

Speaker 5:          01:54:30       Cause that was what was called the prep school champ, you know, versus like, but once I went out there and you're so hungry, you want to kill the fucking guy. Like I'm like, you made me fucking star for fuck. I was getting pussy before wrestling. I was going against the anger and pussy with this guy again. I'm Sam. I was like finger down fucking hard. Like I'm going to fucking kill this person in front of me. Like, like, cause this fucker made me starve. I'm going to, I'm going to kill him. So you would get, you would actually get like real anger at your opponents. I was named get myself, my opponent, my life, the whole world because they made, I was like, fuck. Like they made you do what you're doing. They didn't make me do shit. I made myself. I was the angry, whatever it is.

Speaker 5:          01:55:06       I couldn't eat. Eating was like brutal. I'm too logical for that. I'd never got angry at opponents, but I, I, I would get angry at myself if I fucked up. I would get in of myself if I lost, but I don't remember ever really being angry at being a dick that people take a bad shot. I would clap at them. I'm like, Oh really? Like while you were wrestling, I was wrestling and the head like not even shoot, just to fucking punch him in the head. Like wow. My first and my middle school wrestling team and long island, we were like the worst. Like every kid was a bad sport. We all cry and we lost and throw chairs and like just curse out the other coach. I didn't want to got to boarding school. I tried that. My first match I lost and I threw a chair and they keep going up the team for like, they're like, you made me pick up rocks for an hour.

Speaker 1:          01:55:48       One of the really good things about doing taekwondo as an organized sport was that the school that I did it with, they were really big on manners. They were really big on calling everyone sir. It was Mr. Kim and Mr O'malley. And when they talked to you is yes sir and no sir. So because like they enforced this sort of code of conduct and your in your behavior, it made me like, like behave like way better in competition than I would if I was just all wild and willy nilly like a wrestler.

Speaker 5:          01:56:20       Oh yeah. And then, but then I got to college and then I lost my third match that throw the chair again, went right back to

Speaker 1:          01:56:28       when did you calm down because you know, you're a pretty calm guy now.

Speaker 5:          01:56:31       Yeah. I mean, although like Ah, I got, you know, that fight I got into it with the other comic.

Speaker 1:          01:56:36       Yeah. That other comic. That's unfortunate. The most unfortunate thing is what he said to you while you guys were doing it. I took his joke, right? No, no, no, not even that. Held together. Yeah. Could you imagine that a guy is attacking you and he says we'd done tonight. We dine in hell. Yeah. And I was like, that's what he said tonight. We'd done it. How, how drunk is that dude? I mean he's quoting movies from the 90s. Well, what movie was that tonight we'd done in hell.

Speaker 5:          01:57:01       Uh, it was that gladiator. Was it Claudia? I didn't know that. Cause I go, why did you want to die in hell? And then someone told me dying, dying and he said he was it. They said it was dying, but that guy was able to channel my rage real quick. You know, like that's what it, that's a moment. You don't, you think I find in life that I, I think I have something in their control. I think I got it going. But it sometimes that that one trigger,

Speaker 1:          01:57:25       well, you know, sometimes people can mistake a nice person for someone who's a God that Nigga fuck with too. You know? And you're always a friendly guy. And that happens too, especially when people get drunk and stupid. They just make mistakes. You know, alcohol is a terrible drug for decision making. It's amazing that we make as few shit decisions as we do because you would really realistically look at the Access to alcohol that the modern adult has. And uh, how many people have basically got their shit together? It's kind of shocking. You know, we should all be a fucking complete and total wreck with it. Just a gigantic laundry list of mistakes that you've made every time we've had a few drinks.

Speaker 5:          01:58:06       Oh Man. Like make my girlfriend, uh, I got banned from checking on the cruise and I took her with me. I was the worst, I think. Got a letter saying my girlfriend couldn't drink. Oh, that's all sober now. I say we, that was an issue, but she's,

Speaker 1:          01:58:22       I like the way he said it was, that was an issue. But I'm just immediately, I just, some seeing flashes of people that I've known and that issue is, and what that could be and all that entails scenes in movies with girls who are really crazy drunk. And Adam sitting there shaking his head, well, fucking beers flying in the air plates dropping.

Speaker 5:          01:58:41       That was the, that was the worst man that would start fights with me. She's like, I want to take, I want to learn Jujitsu. What she said you did too, and hang on my neck. I'm like, it's Jujitsu, you know, like it was once you to fuck her. And she does want me to find just what that was. No, she would get drunk and uh, it, it was like she'd be like, we were in Canada. I'm, I'm walking home, you know, it was kind of, you know, she tried to walk home from Canada. Yeah. But she's, I love her. She's the love of my life and she's, she's great. She's definitely for this other podcasts. I could do that. No one on here. So it's the same girl that you're with now? Yeah. Two years you've been together. Um, she's half Filipino, half Swedish.

Speaker 1:          01:59:20       Hey man, people get drunk. They fuck up. Shit happens. No alcohol is evil. Evil drives for some people it definitely is. Everybody has a different reaction. I've seen people drink and they get a little silly and that's it. And I've seen people drink word to fucking shark eyes. There are their pupils go black and they're gone and they're not there. You're looking at them and they're looking right through you. They're like, they're in another world. They're alerts, they're on the Winnie the Pooh ride at Disneyland, fucking live, live in their life and bright, bright neon colors and floating honeypots. They don't know what the fuck is going on. I've seen it, I've seen it and good friends. And I know when I've talked to them the next day that they don't have any recollection whatsoever of the night.

Speaker 5:          01:59:57       Yeah. I mean, I know and I, and I didn't know that really until I started taking, I was taking Adderall for while to like call me down and an Ambien at night to sleep and I was starting to have like, like they talk about Ambien zombies. Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:00:11       Glad. Listen, my glad you're, you're willing to talk about that. This is a, this Adderall problem is a, is a big problem. I know a gang of people now, it's like, it was just only like three a couple of weeks ago, but now I know like six or seven people that have had problems with that shit. Yeah. Yeah. I mean in the descriptions that I've heard from people like Dunkin's description of the way it makes you feel, this is horrific. Your description is pretty horrific.

Speaker 5:          02:00:39       I don't, I, I just think it reminds me of coke and I don't really like to cook buzz. It just makes me want to do more Adderall. Like just like I want to do more coke. Yeah. It didn't really change that much for me, honestly. It was like, it definitely made me a little more focused and kept me up a little more, but it did just a little more. Yeah. It wasn't still taking speed and it's just, I know just a little more, but I'm telling you how I felt. I'm not telling you what you were a good person for it maybe in like that fits. Yeah, I sort of think, well that's the thing. It was like, I want, when I, if I go to a therapist and she said, family history, oh my mom has schizophrenia. Oh my dad is in recovery. My sister's in recovery, my brothers. Then they go, okay, what do you need? You know, that's pretty much how they do it with me, you know? And uh, and so then they gave me like, you know, Alexa, because I was at an OCD battle for awhile. Like I would just like, my mind was just not stopped going and I would think that I was driving and I hit somebody even though I didn't that circled the block. So they're like, oh, I just had like some high school was the rough, like OCD was rough in high school.

Speaker 1:          02:01:36       Go for it. Like, well, what do you, what do you think, if you had a guess, what do you think that's based on? Is that something that comes from stress and environment? Is that something

Speaker 5:          02:01:44       that comes from me? I mean, I think it's genetics because like for me, I would, I went to go see a specialist and he said in a one to 10 you're about a four. And you know, you could either go take psychotherapy or every day you could take a pill and then that'll, and then I was like, I'll take a pill, you know, because other than, so I started

Speaker 1:          02:02:02       obsessive compulsive behavior is based on what it was.

Speaker 5:          02:02:05       And then the balance of something, lack of Serotonin in your head, you know what that means, you know? So they give you like an Ssri, is that what it is? Yeah. And it was, you know, if I've been on it for like, well I don't know off a little bit, but I'd say on for like 10 years, 12 years. Oh Wow. These Alexa. And it's helped because, I mean I literally, I would like, like whatever, like you're not supposed to think about is like what you think of like for me, how, how, how, how, how my mind works, you know? And so I would just start like thinking that, oh my ass is dirty all day. Like, even though I knew it wasn't fucking ass, I would wipe my fucking eye. And then all of a sudden whenever I got stressed, like I had a hot chick one time with their legs fucking spread and like, hold on, I gotta go, I gotta take a shower, I got to start fucking having panic attacks in my head. Really. And it was, it was fucking brutal. Brutal. And it's based on a lack of Serotonin. That's what the therapist said, or the psychiatrist or psychologist,

Speaker 1:          02:02:58       the human mind is so fucking fascinating. You know that levels of this and that can change things for pro and con. It's, it's really kind of, it's, it's so weird because like that's basically the quality of your life is based on the, the your ability to think and move, right? That's it. Those are your, that's and your loved ones obviously, but the quality of your life is baked based on some shit that we don't completely understand. Like how many of us, you know, are aware of all these different functions that are going off at any given second that allow you to string together the words to complete a sentence. There's all those fucking firing going on inside your head and we just hope it keeps going. We just hope it makes sense and hope it works. And I think it's great when there's stories like yours that sort of override a lot of the stories that you hear. Like there's a lot of, especially recently with the school shootings, it's been a lot of talking about, you know, ssrs and connecting antidepressants to school shootings and it's, there's a huge number. So it's, it's nice to hear both, uh, uh, you know, both sides of it and hear a positive story that it took you and bounced to out.

Speaker 5:          02:04:08       Yeah, it did. I mean I definitely didn't like, I was always worried like take it during wrestling season cause I forgot what I was going to lose it because my friend had a similar things are taking, it started losing matches and in my mind that was like, well if I take it because what happens is your mind just never stops. So if I, if I do this and this is going to happen, you know those commercials they have a for like this person went like this and then that person that and it's personal and then the next thing and now don't be a whatever. You don't talking about the insurance, I forgot the name of the brand, whatever. So kind of what happens here like oh if I don't get a boner right now, then I'm gay and I'm gay. I'll come on to quite loud the back of a closet, my dad's going to be disappointed and the, and then my kids just know on time.

Speaker 1:          02:04:47       What is the current thinking on this kind of behavior? Is it nature or nurture? Because I know that they connect a lot of the way a child becomes an adult, a lot of weird shit that they have to lack of attention, love and certain things. Lack of focus when kids are really young. I wonder what it is that makes someone develop like an aberration and the train of thought, like a weird thing that they can't control and whether it is growing up in a life full of uncertainty when you need certainty the most. I mean, in order to, you know, when you, when you were a child, do you want to think that everything's going to be fine? But when you're a child and you realize, well, there's absolutely no way, everything's fine, everything is fucking a crazy mess and this is life from here on out. And that's how your mind develops.

Speaker 5:          02:05:31       Oh, like before mastery matches, like when I was the most nervous, I would call up my dean of my high school and be like, ah, I took two desserts last year. Uh, I, I'm not even kidding. I would do this. And then he'd be like, okay, just go win the match. And I go pin the kit. It was like fucking insane. And you just, you needed acceptance. Yeah. I mean a lot of that is, and then it's also, but I think also it's, I think if you could channel energies, like there was a, I coached wrestling and there's so many kids out there that like if they would just put the fucking effort like that they put in a world of Warcraft or whatever and to something else. And I'm not saying anything's wrong with world of Warcraft, but you know, then they would be so much more productive.

Speaker 5:          02:06:12       And that's what, you know, my high school, the hide was about taking kids who are extremely negative shit going on and taking that and channeling and deposit it. Like you had to play a sport, you had to uh, you know, talk about your feelings every week for like a couple hours a day. Like you have to go to seminars. I, I was there with like talking about your feelings, it talk about your issues and I was there with like Jim Belushi sign and shares kid was there and like all these like it's funny story. I actually went to go visit my sister at the seminar one time and I was, I was running away from the house and being a bad kid and then the assistant, they, oh they had these seminars, it, everyone talks about their problems and they said okay. Lisa was like, and my sister and my dad were like come to the seminar.

Speaker 5:          02:06:53       So I like went and I'm like, okay, don't talk to me about anything. I'm like a punk kid. I don't talk anything bad. So right away my sister, it's her turn to speak Adam, you don't do what the loss of your mother, you don't deal with anything. You and I start crying and I'm like 12 fuck you. And I walk out and I waited in the car for like forties I'm like, I'm not going back to those fucking seminars at this boarding school in Maine. So then I'm walking down this hill and my dad is sitting with chair because share, his son went there, share and Greg Allman, the Allman brothers, and, and then she has like, Hey, my dad's like, hey, share my, my kid's having a really rough time. You'd say hello to one or something. So I'm walking a 12 years old, 84 pounds and then share it goes, uh, Hey Adam. I go, hey, share and keep walking. I didn't even fucking acknowledge her. It was like it. Hey share. It. Just kept fucking walking.

Speaker 9:          02:07:36       Wow. It's like, fuck this. Yeah. Sharon kids with Greg home and I forgot about that cause I thought like you went to school with chastity Bono Jazz.

Speaker 5:          02:07:45       Yeah, no. And I went to, I went with that Elijah a lie to Ahmond. What is that kid life? He was a cool kid. He was like, uh, you know, he was a really good guy and musician. He was on tour with like nine inch nails there. I was genes that when he was like 16 or something.

Speaker 9:          02:08:00       And the kids of celebrities like that. Like your dad's Gregg Allman and your mother share. Good luck.

Speaker 5:          02:08:06       Yeah. That's a fucking tough ride, man. I would, yeah, that's, and that's what the thing is that, that's, that's the beauty of being a kid. But the hard part about being a parent is like, no matter how successful you are, like if you don't give a shit about them, like you don't give a shit about you

Speaker 9:          02:08:20       that it'll come out. It'll be pretty evident in the way they're raised. You're going to, they're going to be, you're going to be able to see how much time this person took in spent. It was a bad parent. But I'm saying in general, a lot of people are bad parents because nobody told them how to do it right then. No one did it right to fam and they don't know how to do it right and they fuck up and they're a mess themselves. And they try to get it together for their kids, but their week, you know, like most of us are, you know, most, most people, uh, don't have a good, they don't have a good blueprint. They don't have a good directions manual for this life. They're just fucking making mistakes and apologizing and trying to pay as much attention to what everybody else's

Speaker 5:          02:08:56       do you want from coaching. Now, coaching, wrestling, you see the kids, the parents come to the matches and carrots come to practice and parents that don't and that how the kid is such a, you know, it's an easy example. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          02:09:09       So it's real unfortunate when you see kids that are growing up with parents that don't give a fuck about them. You know, and you'd go to a park and like, there'll be like one kid when you're like, where is your, who's watching you man? Cause like four years old and he's just like free at the park park.

Speaker 5:          02:09:23       That's the hard part about these comedy shows on the cruises, like clean shows for little kids and kids. Sometimes kids like, you're not funny, you know, like a five year old heckles you and I can't say anything back. I don't want to lose my job. You know, I got my thing, I looked at the kid, I go, look at me, I am your future. And then the kid just like dead in his tracks, like, ah, he doesn't know what to say. I completely confused. You have to deal with five-year-old haircuts. That's hilarious. But the fibroids, it's when the parent heckles that's, I'm like, really? You're going to have to be on a kid with the kid right there. Yeah. They had that parent heckles like, oh, when's the calling me coming on or something. And I'm like, oh my goodness. And I'm like, dude, I always say, listen, come back at 11 o'clock at the adult show and we could have this discussion.

Speaker 5:          02:10:04       You know, it's just right. But then you turn it into the dark, the bitter coffee. It's like such a fine line, you know? Well, you know, people think they're on vacation. They should be entertained. And if they don't think you're funny and why aren't even like them. So I'm just curious. Speak my mind. All right. Pay me $100 would be locked in a closet every night. But now it's like, like the, the cruise that I worked for, its young and it's just people fucking like, whoa. Like it's, I mean, not like, I mean that's it. The whole cruise. I you just see a lot of single people. Okay. Music, Dat, Dat, dat like hip hop. You see like the hip hop club at night. I mean, you might as well be having sex. The dancing that goes on is like, I mean the guy has a fucking hard on, the girl has her ass cheeks to him.

Speaker 5:          02:10:48       She's just bending over and he's just rubbing his fucking boner in her ass and everyone's like, and this is going on everywhere. When I, how many dudes come doing that? Just dance. Just rubbing. Like this is good. This is awesome. I mean it's, you know, they, I mean is that cheating if you come while dancing? I don't think it is. It's a culturally accepted six dance, a dance move somewhere along the line. That became the thing, the way that people dance. So they rubbed her ass against your took. There wasn't like normal. That was like pretty rare, just a few years back. But now it's like fairly normal when people in clubs. A lot of fun. By the way, his podcast. Thanks for having me on man. I was, I was actually, I was more nervous about this, that I was Jay Leno. Why? Why would you be nervous about it?

Speaker 5:          02:11:31       I don't, well I don't know. I was wondering about this in anything because because you are like an Alpha male. I mean, and it's not in a bad way, but you're Joe Rogan and you got your, like you have this thing and then it's like, I, I never wanted to ask you for anything. Like, everyone's like, why don't you have row go on? And I'm like, I don't want to ask him for anything. You know, I don't want to be that guy who, cause I don't want to do that, you know? And I was just sorta like when I, when I met you a couple of times and I was like, I felt like I was that nerdy fanboy kid that was like, Oh, who's gonna win this one? Who's the one note? And then you looked like you couldn't wait to get away from me.

Speaker 5:          02:12:00       No, no, no. You didn't seem like that at all, man. I felt like I was just annoying on your head. It's an annoying kid that bothered you and I, and I wouldn't step and if I was you, I would feel the exact same way about me. I was like, who is this annoying kid? It's asking me these questions. This is all on your own headband. There was none of that going on. Just start your another funny comments. I get real simple. And then I actually like did Dmu once I said, hey man, we need this and you didn't respond. I'm like, great. I fucking blew it. Like, and he's not going to, this is, I don't even look at those things. For the most part, they're good. Too many of them. CD goes out. I'm going to all these negative comments and then everyone's going to say, you suck.

Speaker 5:          02:12:35       And then Dana White's going to be like, you're never working. And then it to me, next thing I know, I'm like all that stuff. No, it doesn't stop if I don't get sleep at the sleep thing is like big. And I had stopped taking ambien. That was the point because I was getting with the Ambien, I was taking the Ambien to go to sleep on the cruises because you lose the three hours when you fly and then you're on a boat. And Paula and I couldn't sleep at night because it shows her at 1230 at night. And then I'm up when I'm up, you know, comedies, adrenaline like when you're up, I'm not going to bed an hour after my five year olds are talking shit too far it up. Yeah, exactly. So then, uh, I started taking ambien. My Dad, my dad changed your last name, bad, says, hey man, take uh, take some ambient.

Speaker 5:          02:13:13       You'll knock out in a second. It's like awesome advice. No, just Melatonin that manage Alice Cooper in the 60s. That's the whole thing. Just jerking off. He has a great Frank Zappa bailing. I'm gonna Start with the jail story. Tell you about that in second. So my dad, uh, says, Hey, take this ambiance, I start taking the Ambien and then next thing I know the next day my whole Twitter there was, was filled with shit that I wrote. I don't remember writing. And I started like they said like you can get into like Ambien zombies state the, I didn't think that was true. These people were just bullshitting.

Speaker 1:          02:13:43       I have a whole bit about it. But being in a hotel in San Francisco when it was on fire and all these people were waking up on Ambien, it was so obvious

Speaker 5:          02:13:50       and do and I was like, literally I had sex with my girlfriend one night did. I was like, Hey, what time do you come home last night? It's like we fucked. And I was like, Oh shit. Like we did fuck. And then like little memories of us walking and she's like, yeah, you were great. I was like, the best I've ever been was on fucking Ambien as a Zombie of a pill. That's scary on a boat. You could have just walked off the side of the boat, Zombie thing, dude. And I was like, I told my girlfriend, I'm like, hide my keys. If I take ambiance, I don't drive. But when you got to say hide your keys, you don't drive. Maybe you shouldn't be taking a shit. You know what kind of tweets to Jules send out? I was being super nice. All of a sudden I was like, hey Tim Duffy, pick fan. When's your next fight? And you responded. I was like, Todd Duffy. I was like so big. I know your first name. All these MMA people like I was like answering all my people that tweet me like, Hey, thank you. And now, but then it was misspelled words. It was like choppy, choppy sentences.

Speaker 1:          02:14:41       The front. It was a real problem with it. I have, I actually have several friends, one a that lives on the east coast. I don't talk to him that often, but he's got a real problem with it. He can't sleep without that shit.

Speaker 5:          02:14:50       Best Sleep I ever got. I mean, I had that. That is the other side to it. You're in a fucking, you're in a coma. I'm not interested. Cma, yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:14:59       I think zinc, magnesium, this slot, a lot of, a lot of different, but you know, then again, my brain doesn't work the way your brain does. I get obsessed with shit, but I get obsessed like a singular, I get obsessed like, uh, like there'll be like something whenever it is video game, playing pool, Jujitsu, whatever it is, and then that starts taking over my entire day and then everybody else has just taken up time before I get back on the mat again. Or taking time before I can go play pool again. Anytime, you know, that's, I have an issue with that where I don't, I'm not like a good balance her, you know, I do a lot of different shit and luckily it just sort of organically fits together. But if it was just me, I could go off the rails into the woods on either one of them. Right, right. You know, it's almost like I need a bunch of different things to fixate on all the time. That's my, my issue. That's great though. Yeah. I have a hard time just chilling out. I can't just like, I have a hard time.

Speaker 5:          02:15:52       I'm the same way. I, I know

Speaker 1:          02:15:54       I'm learning how to vacation and I was like some new shit for me. I liked doing it now like I'm getting, I'm getting to the, the idea of, but before I go on vacation, I have this wild, crazy buildup where like, I burned myself out physically. So I don't feel bad that I'm not going to work out on vacation. You know? I have like all these, I write a shitload so that I don't feel bad for not writing.

Speaker 5:          02:16:16       Yeah, I dunno. So that's, that's my relaxing I've been doing lately. The year it's watching coal seasons of movies. Like that's actually like, I just been a sons of anarchy. You Watch that? No, I don't watch that. I watched it once. I didn't like it. He would give another shot, fucking

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       talk. Shit, can you get me? But like, Olin's got my love. I like that. I was watched the whole thing. I machine homeland. No, shut the fuck up about sons of anarchy. God Damn, really? You don't even know how good homeland is. Homeland, it's fucking sensational. It's one of the best shows I've ever watched. I'm on season two right now. Oh yeah. I watched all of season one and I was not excited about this other than the recommendations people were giving him. It didn't seem like anything that was really interested in and I'm like terrorists sort of drama. Like why? Why do I want to watch this? But God, God damn is it good every time that show ends, I go, damn, that's a good show. And it makes you realize like, I'm really appreciate the artwork of making a great television show because it only comes along like once a year. You know, like once a year you got to breaking bad or you gotta soprano's or something like that. You know, it's like not even once a year. Once every two or three years. More so now I think than ever before because there's so many of them on there's a boardwalk empire, which is sensational. I just started getting into that. There's a, of course you got the um, uh, there's, there's, there's so many Dexter's I don't like the extreme. The more I watched Dexter,

Speaker 3:          02:17:41       that's that hope had the funniest tweet you gave up on it. The street. Thanks Dad. Hope you said, uh, it would be less realistic if they had a cartoon. More realistic of had a cracked tooth next to Dexter. Like walking around. I kept picturing that next day.

Speaker 1:          02:17:56       Well, I gave up on Dexter when uh, the fuck is his name. John John Lithgow choked out chicken a proud tub. It was the worst name ever seen in my life. So unrealistic. I could never watch the show again. He didn't, he didn't really choker, he didn't, there was no real choking. I'm sorry. If you're going to fight back, you got to try to get out of this. What? I'm just choking you and cutting your leg. You would be fucking flailing like death. It would be insane if a guy, if a guy is going to choke someone to death, okay, there's a struggle involved in that. Even with a chick, you're going to realize your life is on the line and even even, even if it's fruitless, there's going to be an attempt at, it was the worst rear naked choke have ever seen and it made me angry and as an MMA commentator and a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black on that scene wasn't really, I'm, no, I won't do it.

Speaker 1:          02:18:50       It was fake. It was just such a, look, this Claire Danes, chick who's in homeland, this bitch can act her tits off. She's so good. She's so good. Mrs Rogan said it best. She said that watching her and then you watch the other people act. You're like, what the fuck are you all doing? Do you see what she's doing? Cause this is, I mean she plays a crazy person in it too and it's just off the chart. Good. She's so good that when you, you know, you compare it to like crappy acting or boring acting. It's just like, come on man.

Speaker 3:          02:19:22       It's hard because once again, it's like people, they want to become a famous, they don't want to actually study the craft. And then Claire Danes went to like Oxford or like England crazy school tube, bro. Let me tell you something. You can't be, you can't act crazy that good unless you know crazy intimately. That's true. That's a good fucking show, man at home when it's good show. But you think about there's madman now, which is apparently a very good show. Boardwalk Empire. You know, I don't, I think it was that good. I've never seen it all. You'd love it. It's about a sex addict. I didn't get if you'd like it. You think it's good though? Yeah, it was great. It's funny man. He's an interesting cat, you know, to go from being the guy from, you know Molly? Yeah. What was the name? Older. Older. Older from the x files to being a sex addict and then in real life he's a sex addict supposedly yet.

Speaker 3:          02:20:12       But that's, that's that whole sex addict thing is hilarious. It's a a funny a compulsion, you know it's also like one of those addictions is that like, cause I, I I actually went to a meeting one time, I thought I was a second sex addict. Why? Because he likes girls. No, I went to one. Yeah, because why? Because you like girls. Well what happened was I was, I had a girlfriend that like I was sort of cheating on, we weren't officially together, but when we were together, you know like you don't make an official but you know you're supposed to be together with the person. Oh I see what you're saying. And so you still have a clause cause you know, cause there, well we never wrote anything down even though we kind of live together now. Right. So let me, so then I was like, you know what, I'm sorry.

Speaker 3:          02:20:52       Cause what happened, I was getting, I was actually getting a blow job and my phone was on and the girl heard me talking and then I go up and heard me talking shit like baby, you liked that. But he also know when she called, it was so, it was like just a fucking, I was like caught in the act because I was not good. So I said to her, listen, I'll go to a meeting. I, I'm, I'm a sex. I used the sex addicts like that. Get Out. I figured that was the best way to like get out of this. So I went to a meeting and I figured those meetings, we are creative place to get lunch. No, no, no. Well one of the things they ask, how many people here are required to be heard by law? Right. And then like a bunch of hands go up.

Speaker 3:          02:21:28       Those are the molesters. So then the whole time I'm looking at them wondering what they did. Just trying to figure out what they're guilty for so I couldn't even function. I'm probably not a molester. Probably someone who got caught with a hooker, that's probably more correct. Was trying to figure it out. Probably do two buses. Like street walkers. Like, if you're a guy and you look, if you're a girl and you get caught for prostitution, it's, you know, there's a lot of cops looking for prostitutes. But if you're a guy and you get caught with a prostitute, it seems to me at least they'll like, you got to fuck up, you've got to do something stupid, you know, street walking, you know, for the guy to get busted, he's probably driving around in his car, picking up hookers and the cops come up and they see you do with a wig. Paul, I went down to your place, I would come off. But if you're mad, some people don't. There's that. There's some people don't want them to know where they live, but I mean it's like there's not a lot of guys who get busted with that. I would think. I would think that more of more women get busted then, then guys. Right. Uh, I would think, I don't, I

Speaker 5:          02:22:26       don't know anybody. Everybody wants to with a hooker.

Speaker 9:          02:22:27       I've never heard of that before. Yeah. But so, but that would, that would be though, I would think you would have to take like sex addiction counseling. If you got busted with a hooker, they would say, Hey, what's your problem? You're a sex addict. Don't. Wow. How about the dude just needed a blowjob and yeah. It's so funny. It's so funny. He's an addict. It feels good. You're addicted and things that feel good. I know there is, the Buzzword is undeniable though. Compulsive activity. You know, when, when, when people, when someone is like one of those guys, it's like jerking off like on his iPhone while he's driving. Like there's, there's people that do that.

Speaker 5:          02:23:03       Oh yeah. Oh, the world. The worst time I did was, uh, I was in Korea doing comedy for like the troops and there's a place called like Hooker Hill, right? It's called the Hooker Hill. And it's like, and it's all these like girls that did the columns, them see girls, ladies, these Korean hookers, you buy him shoes for like $10 then now your friend, you know, for the rest of the night, what's the $10 and like won't tell you that they talk to you for a couple of hours. Right? Oh, they talk to you, but then I, but then you can negotiate some other shit. So I was say, I was in Korea and then some girl was like, well how much her hand job and she's like $100. I'm like, I'll give you 10. It's like, fine. Whoa. Yeah. So we'd go in the back. Right. So we got Asians usually so much better at negotiating.

Speaker 5:          02:23:44       So we go into back and she's like, what do you do? I'm like, Oh, I'm a comedian. And she goes, it takes my dick and goes, hey, Jerry. And I didn't, I didn't know if she meant like Jerry Lewis or Jerry Seinfeld, I couldn't figure out. That's what I'm thinking about while getting the hand job, you know? Wow. So she used you tick as a microphone? Yeah, it was, it was ridiculous and no, no, no, it was, it was fucking absurd. I was like, that was, yeah, I was young. I was 23 Hooker Hill. Huh? What part of Korea is outside of Seoul? Right. I was going to soul. Yeah. I mean it's, what is soul like? It's gotta be a strange place. Uh, it's very like a lot of cheap clothes, Hooker Hill. But like you walk into the hook, the bar and all of a sudden and all of a sudden heads come up, like walk them all, you know, like all of a sudden like this random Korean hookers heads go up.

Speaker 5:          02:24:32       But uh, yeah, I know I went to Korea. The weirdest, I was in Bahrain doing comedy for the military. I did like Saudi Arabia, Japan, Korea, Guam, Cuba, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But it was funny cause like, but I'll talk about Bahrain. So I'm like, there's like this club in Bahrain, it's like English, British are there, the Saudi like whatever people that, people from Saudi Arabia that are like sending, because Allah isn't in Bahrain, but he's in Saudi Arabia. So that's where they go to like cheat on their wives and get hookers and drugs and drink, wait a minute, what, how's it work? Cause like as long as they leave Saudi Arabia, what I mean, this is what people told me, I'm not, you know, that's a good religions. So then they would talk flight and you just get your freak on. So there was like a Filipino band playing karaoke band that were dope.

Speaker 5:          02:25:17       They had a big hit in the eighties or something. So all these like Korean hookers dancing around. So I, I make with one of them and I go back to her whorehouse I'm like, I I see, and this is when my space first came out, right? So I go to this Korean whorehouse in Bahrain and there were all these like Americans, like soldiers living there. People were like, can't make, like Dave had moved into the whorehouse. Right. So I'm like, oh that's her boyfriend living with the, with the girls. And then whoa. So then I was like trying to get, like, I'm like, I take one over to the computer. They had a computer that was like a, you know, apple 84 or something, you know. So I'm trying to show you one of them

Speaker 10:         02:25:49       my myspace page and I'm trying to look in the Korean to English language to like, no, a comedian explained comedy, you know, so funny.

Speaker 5:          02:26:01       And then the, then the hooker mom kicked me out. She was like, you can't stay unless you're going to buy one of the hookers. Oh, that's hilarious. It seems like that would be pretty cheap. You just didn't want to pay. I didn't want to have sex and I don't like to have,

Speaker 10:         02:26:12       didn't you feel like you owed him some money just for wasting all the time? No. I love to waste bringing them over to a computer and look, this is me. This is me to like listen, if, well this is a hooker place. We're not here to look at your fucking resume. Yeah, no, I like wasted people.

Speaker 5:          02:26:27       I find that funny. I ended up beating up the other comic on the tour, uh, because you beat him up, throw him on his head. What happened was this guy like I'm supposed to go with Gleed. It was one of my best friends bank leap, but he had to bail out. So I end up going with this other guy from Texas. Black comic was most racist guy. You go would go up there and be like, George Bush is a fucking asshole to the military. And he would close with like peanut butter on his cock with dog licking off. And I had to do his time and he kept calling me a fag in front of all the soldiers. Adam's a fair, I don't feel it goes, it just wouldn't stop. Why was he doing? He was just a bully. Like, cause I said Eddie Murphy's movies aren't as good anymore as they used to be mad. You don't know shit about anymore. It was just giving me a hard time. This guy, right? So there's an angry fellow. So we get to Africa to boody Africa. You kicked his ass in Africa

Speaker 10:         02:27:12       when the white man kicks a black man's ass, Africa and I had to bail. You brought in. We brought them into the country to kick it

Speaker 5:          02:27:21       and they shook us down and customs, right. You go to customs and they take our money. It took his money. We get to like, it was all kind of weird. So we go to steal your money and I had to pay for it, pay for him to get through customs. Right. Wow. They steal like 50 bucks. How's that work? They were like a cost of y'all. It's coming to the country. Even though we already paid with the vast boards, we already had it all clear. So they brought this, you know, that they didn't like say give us your money. He sold that money. So, so we go there and then we're in in this Cantina with all the soldiers and I have to, and I'm ignoring this guy cause he just keeps fucking with me. Um, so he's like, Amen. You're a fag. You hooked up with trainees in Saudi Arabia or something.

Speaker 5:          02:27:55       Right. Which did not happen. It didn't have so leave. You would tell us. I probably would. So then, uh, so then the guy, I like pushed it, I'm like, well, let me fag. I take his hat and push it down cause then he comes at me and I over under and just hip toss him on his head, which was like, you know, probably had no idea it was coming. No idea was coming. And so I'm like, who's the fact now? You know? And then the soldiers had to break us up for fighting. Right. We came to entertain them. Did you try to submit them? No, I, I just was like,

Speaker 9:          02:28:22       you fucker like, come on dude. You know, did you hit him at all when he's not the guy we got broken up real quick, but the, the guy at sergeant Haggerty took us into the bathroom and he's like, what's wrong with you guys? You, you know, on a peace keeping mission, you know, you're going to find Jesus. He's a guy. He's like, he goes, I'm either going to take your money is what I did to my boys. I'm gonna take your money or I'm gonna Punch you in the stomach. Right? And we already got all our money stolen, so we're like, just punch in the stomach to the sergeant punches. Both from the stomach. Yeah. And then I'm like thinking to myself, your money or punched in the stomach. How much money? I mean, he punched all, we didn't have any money on it, so he just punched us.

Speaker 9:          02:28:53       That seems ridiculous. That's what I, that's how he treats his boys. He said, wait a minute. He robs him or punches him. He either. Yeah, that's benefiting him in both circumstances. So son of a bitch. So action starts at home. So the next thing I know, I'm thinking of myself, I'm in a bathroom and Djibouti, Africa and I just got punched in the stomach. Like how many wrong turns in my life do they make to get to this point? You know, that's a lot. Did you just take it as a, like an opportunity to work on your abs, tighten up and let them blast away? Go ahead, bitch. Adrenaline. It didn't hurt, you know, Hook you in the liver. It would been terrible. Dirty bastard. Did you let him make an agreement where he was gonna hit? You know, he just punched in the stomach and then that means you have a stomach.

Speaker 9:          02:29:35       Like what the ribs kind of, but it wasn't a letter to this man. I could throw a hook. I can actually take a decent punch like mayhem punched me like last week. Yeah, I heard about that. What happened? Well, you know what don't say, because then you can get sued. Yeah. I could give a bad interpretation because I got a picture of a big lump on my head. It was an act could have happened anywhere. You could get hit in the head with the media. How do we know those little shooting stars? You see what if one burnt out just as it hits you, it just barely knocked you on your ass and gave you a little, that's a good point. So that possible. I want to know if anyone has ever been hit in the head by a media. I really would like to know because I know they've landed in houses.

Speaker 9:          02:30:11       Wow. That was anybody ever been hit by a meteor. Okay. We gotta Google this. Okay. I'm saying yes, Brian, you're saying yes, right? Man, hit by and they claim they have, but how do you know what actually hit them? Because he doesn't have an army anymore. What do you think I'm going forward before I Google it. Yes. Yes. It happened. Yes. I think it happens a lot. Coroner's report, man killed by media, right? That had coroner's report, man killed by media, right. Had marijuana in his system. Oh my God. So this dude, he was killed. Oh Wow. This is like fairly recently. This dude was killed by a fucking media. He was high as shit and it was walking through the town of San [inaudible], California, and he got hit by a media. Right. Some good weed right there. That is unbelievable. Yeah, that sucks. That's, that's what, that's what you know, you're having a bad day. You know, like you have no luck. God dammit. I think this is a fucking get hit by lightning twice. There's been a guy out there that parody God by lightning twice these of bitches.

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       No, this was a parody. They wouldn't tell you if a guy got killed by a media, if he had patna system. It's one of those silly websites where they're trying to be cute. Okay, well this one is a guy who really did get killed by a meteorite. Wow. This one's not funny at all.

Speaker 1:          02:31:36       Make it funny. It's impossible, but I mean, I'm saying it's not a funny store story at all. Yeah. There's a couple of people that can hit this. One woman had a big Gash on her arm, but parents should live. She got grazed by meeting. Right, which is even crazier. Think of that. A meteorite king from another planet flew through our solar system, penetrated our atmosphere, and then hit her in the arm. Almost just grazed her gay read second Gash. Wow. Well, here's another one. A man was struck by one killed instantly. Damn. It appeared. The media had come from a direction, a little west or south of fellow bleakly at an angle of about 60 degrees. It passed through a fall maple cutting the limbs as clean as if it been a cannon ball and struck him apparently on or under the shoulder passing through him.

Speaker 1:          02:32:27       Oh bleakly from below the right shoulder, two above the left hip and buried itself about two feet in the soft black ground. Mother fucker belt, hard to sign. So it came through his armpit and came out his left hip and then went through the ground. Mother fucker. What a shit he's a locked at is do you imagine it went through a fucking tree, like a cannon ball and then through his body, right armpit to left hip and then two feet into the ground. Shit. All in one big burst of what the fuck just happened and is a giant hole in your chest and you think you've been, you know, probably hit by with a canon or something? Yeah. Or attacked by aliens, you know, Congo load or what the fuck man,

Speaker 1:          02:33:23       it's probably not a lot of people and many times popping out. A lot of people. I wonder, you know, Oh, here's another one. People start. Oh Wow, okay. It actually a, a website that tracks reported deaths and injuries from media. Right. Impact. And there they have them all the way back to 1400 BC in Israel. It's either always the Jews, the Jews. Yeah, they were, they were keeping track even back then at dudes that got killed by media rights. I wonder who has God killed any of your children with media rights? Call this number. You may be entitled to Shit.

Speaker 1:          02:34:05       That's how they were keeping track. One day. I'll tell God, you son of a bitch, I lost my favorite son. Do a fucking media right? Gotta be, yeah. Yeah. All the way back to 18, 25 India. Yeah, there's a, there's a website. Um, um, just Google it reported deaths and injuries from media or any impact. It's fascinating to think about how many fucking people died throughout history. But overall I would say it looks like it's only like a hundred people throughout recorded history. Maybe less, maybe less incredible man. But the, the really scary things. How many media, right? Showers. There have been, one of them, uh, was reported in China in 14, 90 tens of thousands of people were killed during a meteor shower in the Shensi province. Imagine that shit man. Tens of thousands of people killed by flying rocks from the sky. Just all the sudden Dasia rocks are commonsense. Slamming your fucking family. They said the, uh, the similarities, uh, that it was a, like a similar type of impact to where the tongue guscott event,

Speaker 1:          02:35:15       that's the one that, uh, I think it was somewhere in Siberia flatten this huge area of forest that apparently exploded on impact. Like it came and as it was coming in, like probably either exploded just above the ground or close to the ground. And, uh, just from the, you know, just broke apart because of the, uh, coming through and just leveled thousands of miles of trees, just a little leveled to square miles gone of nothing. You look at, pull that up Brian. Tongue goose GFE tongue Guscott event. Cause uh, yeah, just to let us know that that shit can happen at any time. And this is something that happened. I think it was the night, I feel like the 1920s or something like that. But I mean that's like when we started really writing these things down and taking pictures of them. You know, a couple of hundred years ago there was no cameras.

Speaker 1:          02:36:11       So when things like these happened, you know there's your, your, your stories about it are limited to just people telling you what happened. I'm like rocks and stuff. But this tongue goose go event was very unique in the fact that you could actually see what a forest looked like before the impact and what it looked like after the impact. And he just go, Whoa, what the fuck? And then you realize that was that nothing ball that was nothing. That shit didn't do anything that, I mean compared to what the, the, the one that hit the Yucatan and killed all the dinosaurs. I fucking thing didn't do nothing. Right. But the photos of the devastation, those upper left photos, Brian, cause they're all the, they're all black and white because it's the 1920s the upper left. Is there anything with the college back then go up the Oh you son of a bitch cracking jokes.

Speaker 1:          02:36:58       That's what it, that's what the forest looked like after it was over. Like look at that, look at that photo. Just flattened like matchsticks the entire forest mean. Wrap your head around that photo. No one had ever seen anything like that where there was just miles and miles and miles and miles and miles of flat and trees completely pinned down to the ground. Flattened from space and there could be thousands of those hitting it anytime you read to your kids that like a night. Yeah. Yeah. Story. It can. That is my favorite. Really set the cat in the hat man. There motherfucker got lazy. You only wrote two

Speaker 5:          02:37:36       book of that. You know, you like act these out cause you can sometimes look like,

Speaker 1:          02:37:43       well I've not tried to scare me.

Speaker 5:          02:37:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:37:48       I'm not even trying to scare me or scare you. It's just to me, I wonder if you animate them. I think it's important to talk about those things. Absolutely. Bring, bring it up just every now and then. Just let, just get that fucking thought in your head. This is a possibility. This, this, this life that we live, it was, which is so beautiful and uh, so complicated and so well contained in the civilized world that we have could end the lingo that I know one chunk of rock from space.

Speaker 5:          02:38:15       It's hard to live like that though because then you end up spending all your money and just making all of that, I'm serious. I can make a decision. Is that like fuck it, we're going to do that. Like, like I was thinking if I had a week to live, right. Would I be honest like, like about how much there cause that certain people I don't like or I don't like what they're doing or well, even in this world or that world, but don't, I don't say it because I'd be a bad career choice or something or I'm wondering if I had a week to live, if I would say it, probably not because I wouldn't want to be a dick, but I,

Speaker 1:          02:38:39       well if you don't want to be a dick, don't be a dick. It doesn't matter if there's a week to go or an hour ago, just don't be a dick. You can, you know you, it's a focus exercise. I think whenever there's someone that's distracting you and someone that saw that, you're concentrating on them for no reason when they're really not have anything to do with you unless they're affecting your business or affecting, you know, the way you operate in your life. If it's just you fixating on them, just use it as a focus exercise. Just say, you know what? This is obviously a test. What advice would I give someone like me if I was in this situation to give them advice? I would say, well, this is what you don't do. Don't focus on that because there's no benefited. I know you can hate the guy unless you got some material out of it. Unless there's something really funny about it

Speaker 5:          02:39:22       in a cup up. For me being a comic sometimes is that, is that those positive workshops don't work for comedy because I think I'm a lot funnier if I'm being negative like that. It's focused negativity, but it's, but it's negative. You know? It's negative jokes. It says positive but, but if I start looking at everything in a positive way, I think my humor and relating to people is going to go out the window.

Speaker 1:          02:39:43       Well, um, it will change it a morph a little bit, you know? Um, but it's still possible to be really funny and to really be really be positive. It would just be a different kind of funny. I think that you're a funny guy and I think if you're a funny guy, you know how to be funny, you know what I mean? You know, do you know? Thank you sweetie. Uh, you know what I mean? You know how to do it. I think you would be able to do it in any way you'd do it and what it should represent is who you really are. So if occasionally it's mean, cause occasionally you're mean and the of these mean thoughts and they're funny, then you should fucking go with it. That's

Speaker 5:          02:40:12       most of jokes. I mean honestly

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       I'm a, I wouldn't say mean spirited comment cause I don't like to go like, oh hope you die of aids. You know, there's, there's like shock humor. Yeah. Where it's just what you say. I hope you die in a car accident.

Speaker 5:          02:40:24       No, I don't think I would because I wouldn't want that person to die in the car accident here that when he says no, no, no, he would never say that. I don't know if I would say that. I probably, I, you know, I, I've gone and been on stage and someone heckled and I'm like, this is why I'm a pro choice, you know? Or something like that right now where I'm like, but I don't know if I would ever like work that into like, there's some comics they're like, oh, Justin Bieber dies. I would never, but I know it. I know what you're saying.

Speaker 1:          02:40:46       It's like, um, as you trying to get older, like as you're a wiser person to smart inclination is to sort of go towards like less altercations in your life. Last bullshit. Less hassle, less people upset at you, you know? And it's kind of hard to do that when you're a comedian because you have to make fun of some idiots. You'd have to make fun of dummies. You see him, you're like, who? This silly period. You also, I think have to look at the cynical part of things I do. Other people don't have to, but I have to look at too, we should, we all we, it was socially, we all like have an obligation to sort of monitor our surroundings and to keep things from getting out of hand, keep pet rocks from rising again. But every now and then there's some shit that as a comedian like your job really truly is to make fun of these things because they are ridiculous and we're all going to figure out their ridiculous in time with or without comedians like bell bottoms, they just did. Eventually we go, no, stop it. But comedians like that's sort of like the role that a comic plays other than entertainment in society is to point out these things and to say like, look, come on. This is ridiculous. Like there's just too many holes in this idea. I'll give you some, sometimes it's Wayne,

Speaker 5:          02:41:54       you know, like let, let's take NMA roasted for an example. Like last night, Notre Dame was w with that losing like 35 to nothing. Right. And I said Cecil People's had Notre Dame winning know. Right. So that's like, okay, ah, that's not, that's not, it's a funny joke, but I love those jokes. I love Csun people. But then, but then there's like, okay, your, your, your, your colleague Goldberg. Okay. Was accused not thing allegedly doing something right. And it's on the MMA websites, so it's not like I'm making this shit up. It's on the underground. It's on, you know, I mean, maybe weekly, I'm a junkie, but I don't want to piss off this guy because he's a nice guy and he seems like he's, if it is something serious, you don't want to be a total dick to him. So I try to use like Goldberg was hopped on upper as well, watching John Fitch fight, you know, so therefore the job becomes about John Fitch. It's still mentioned that, you know, still mentioning then still mentioning the unmentionable. Right. So then it's like, okay, now I'm able to do that. But there's only so many times you can do that. Right.

Speaker 1:          02:42:49       I've seen people say like a Joe Rogan and a coke rage in the middle of a fight. The reality is I've never tried cocaine once. I've never done it. So I mean you can never say you see me coked up. I've never been coked up. I wrote Joe Rogan's head just exploded during the break. That's, that's not, it's, you know, I know it sounds ridiculous, but I've literally never even thought about cocaine. I really have never, I just, I grew up around people that fuck their entire life up with it. And the last thing I ever needed was like a stimulant. I wanted something that would kind of center me and calm me down. And when one, that's one of the, the, when I found pawn I was like, cause the drink would relax me a little bit, but a drink would also get me riled up in a bad way. Whereas pot like sorta would put me in like a,

Speaker 5:          02:43:33       yeah, right. I could chill. I could, I could. The last thing I wanted to be like, no, I did it. I did it like three times a once off a stripper's tits. Cause she was like, you want to fuck? I said, sure, let's do a line of coke off my tits. I'm like, I'm going to do it. I might as well. That's the time to do it, you know? And then I had a girl do it off my, well my dick one time. Well that was pretty, it was too, I was hooking up with two checks. One of them was not hot, the other one was hot, but it's the kind of, I wanted a threesome. Right, right. So the girl looks at my penis as a line of coke, which she like looks at me. She was, we're never going to have a relationship.

Speaker 1:          02:44:07       Well did she stood her ground. She's got her morals. She's, she's not going to pick a guy like you be willing to do this. Let her snort coke off your Dick. How dare you, like she said then I like the way you described it, like a casting judgment on, you're never going to have a relationship. I can't even believe you're here. I can't believe I'm about to do coke off your Dick.

Speaker 5:          02:44:25       But some women's morals, like I wasn't kidding threesome encounter one time and I was like, some girl was sitting on my face and other kid was like blowing in the, and he goes, ah, at least I don't cheat on my boyfriend. And blew me. Like she thought that wasn't cheating. Like she really was almost like, I was like, dude, I didn't want to be like, you know, listen, you are cheating. Don't stop it. They don't want to cock block. You'd be like, yeah, I hear Ya. Yeah. That was not the time. Blow jobs are so not cheating. Yes. What, what are you going to the things that people do breeding,

Speaker 1:          02:44:57       breeding, shoot loads. Oh, that's the 10 minute mark. Um, does anybody have anything to contribute before we wrap this bitch up and bring it home? Brian, anything going on? He said this Friday you got to a show? No,

I see. Isn't that creamy? You big meaning man, every day I'm hustling Adam comedian on Twitter, but his other one, MMA roasted on Twitter is actually more popular than the actual human being himself, which is kind of weird and sad.

Everything you would say you would limit yourself to like 60 characters. Hey, thank you so much for how, thanks for being on man. Anytime. We'll do it again. We'll do it again for sure.
