Speaker 1:          00:00:01       That was, you looked at that. This is the move point break. Cupcake shirt point bake and we working. Yeah, it's working. Yeah, we live. We, I wish we could start this show off with flavor and you're here. What do we get kicked off of Youtube. Craig mack died. That's just a shout out. I know. I feel like we should be able to, just as a shout out. It is a great fucking song, man. It was such a good song. Dude was only 46 what was it? I didn't even see what he died of. Heart attack. Yeah. Heart failure. 46 fuck man. Major. But we start off the show with a major bummer. Yeah. We will get pulled by youtube. Right? If we did that, we played it for sure. We, I'm sure for sure we won't play. It won't play. Let's just shout out to Craig back. You know what you could do? You could play like someone else who did their version of it. It should have been even then you'd probably get, there he is. Oh, oh biggies. Now this is the, this is the, yeah, I dunno. With notorious lol and bless a bless. No Shit.

Speaker 1:          00:01:14       Yeah, don't, don't, don't put that up on youtube is it already had been up. Okay, good. Everybody's dying. 46 is so young to have a fucking heart attack heart stuff. That's everybody. I guess I should have just guessed hard shit. Well, especially in this day and age, the way people eat terrible. He wasn't, was he that heavy of a dude? I don't think you have to be that heavy with dude clogged arteries. But then there's super, super heavy dudes that just had nothing fun, nothing phases them. There's some guys that just keep on trucking. That's like in Chicago where I'm from. That's everybody I know. Oh yeah. Nobody skinny is offensive. Well not only that, it gets zero degrees all day long. So fucking four months. Yeah, you need the padding. They need something he needed to sell. You need somewhere to hide all that sadness, shove it underneath all this guy has gray.

Speaker 1:          00:02:06       You hear bullets from the south side. So when I got, when I got in a little bit of shape and I went back to Chicago, I caught this like so much shit for that from everybody. You sell out Mr Hollywood. Well you look, you look in lane eaten, eaten well, we eat an avocado. Caring about your future. What does it say Jamie? What are you six? No cause of death was immediately released hill for a while. So that's what I saw. I saw they didn't figure it out yet. Oh I saw something on. Yeah, see that's a problem when someone, you get a bunch of different versions of the story. Um, I went down and Internet rabbit hole last night. Man, this is a very disturbing one. Do you know anything? What's going on in Boyle Heights? No. Boyle Heights. East la, east La. And um, apparently the hipsters are starting to open up our teas and old coffee shops and art galleries there and they're not having it. And uh, the gayborhood is pushing back. It's more than that. There's a lot of, it's like straight

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       up racist. It's anti white racism, which is apparently co totally acceptable. You don't have cameras are blaring in your face. Uh, we'll boil heights, be ruined by one coffee shop. It's not just one coffee shop. They forced a gallery under. Is this an older story from June's? Yeah, they forced a gallery out just through constant harassment and they broke the windows of this coffee shop and, but what I watched last night there was disturbing was these air quote activists standing in front of this gallery. It's a fucking art gallery. And they're screaming,

Speaker 3:          00:03:31       get the fuck out. Get the fuck out of our neighborhood. Get the fuck out. We don't want you here.

Speaker 2:          00:03:37       And the guy was like trying to talk to him like, you know, some hipster guys like, you know, I'm, I identify as a feminist, like one of those guys identify as a feminist, you know, one of those guys. And he was like, yes, I'm here to support. I'm here to support the me. We all fuck it. Why don't you get the fuck out? Get the fuck out there chanting, get the fuck out. Get the fuck to chant, get the fuck out. It's a great chance to put up a sign that says, fuck white art, white fuck white art. The coffee shop, they broke the windows here. The coffee shop was even more fucked up cause one of the guys is actually a Mexican slopper. No, they fucked up proper. Okay. Right? Yeah. One of the guys who were in the coffee shop, they were calling it, it's, they called it like weird coffee or something like that and neither they, they put a sign on a calling it white coffee and they broke the window.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       But one of the guys who owns it is Latino. I don't know if he's Mexican, but he's definitely, it'd be funny to open up a spot called white coffee. Yeah. White people come and people just called white people problems. Look, a new generation of anti gentrification, radicals are on the march in Los Angeles and around the city. This is not a diet is not an accurate way to frame what's happening. No, that's crazy. This is not anti gentrification radicals. These are, these are rioters and then writing. These people have fire in their hands or walking on the street and they're yelling at a bunch of racist shit and they covered their faces up. Look, I get it. I get what's going on. Like they're, they're afraid they're gonna lose their neighborhood and they're afraid their neighborhood's going to be pushed out. The dinosaurs felt the same way. So did so did cavemen. Everybody feels the same way. The world is a fucking fluid moving thing. You can't just save neighborhoods forever. It just doesn't work that way. You can't save anything forever. No. I mean, and there's nothing wrong with a God damn gallery moving into your neighborhood. That's crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:05:20       Right? That's right. Right. Like I fuck, I see it when people do this whole thing about like Walmart's moving into small towns and that they lose, they panic. Like I get that. I understand it's changing industry. A dude selling fucking lattes is not going to dynamically shape and, and if it does, it'll take 15 more.

Speaker 2:          00:05:36       Yeah, it'll take 15 more years, but they know it's coming. They know what happens in these neighborhoods. It's like these hipsters move in first because La real estate is so ridiculous. It doesn't make like I was looking at uh, places near where Carolyn lives count lives in Santa Monica and I was looking places he lives above ground. Yes, I know, right. He lived in like the

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       sewer system or something like that. Like one of them Ninja Turtles, a turtle account live on the beef is scoring system. He lives in a very nice neighborhood. I mean I'm not, but I was just looking in Santa Monica in general and a regular house, like a regular house. It's $2 million. Yeah. Bullshit house like was a fucking normal house house. Nothing like you be like, you can bring a a gal back home like hey my house, you know, look at the view of the city. No, there's none of that around $2 million. You get a shack. Two bed, one and a half bath. Yeah. With fucking old bullshit linoleum. Yeah. Shitty sync with the ring. Where at the fucking water. The dirt has just stayed in those old la La loves doing like, uh, in the 60s. They love doing like a or in the 50s maybe pink light pink and green bathrooms.

Speaker 1:          00:06:44       So it was like pink tile and they leave that and I was just looking today it's Deco's at arc tech or just or just bad decision making. And I was looking at a place today just before I came here. Guys looking just Hollywood hills on the other side. Yeah. It's just, it's a nice, but it's a nightmare. All that stuff. Can you think about, they're like, oh the drainage. I went to a super rich dudes house. How much does that one take? A guess. $2 million. A little more. 2.2 well you know why? Cause it's a Duplo they split it. It, it. Those are two apartments they rent, right? Is that what it is? Yeah. That's to one side is a door or the right and left or doors. Is that, yeah. Yeah. So what La does is they take these old buildings, split them like that so then they can make twice the money.

Speaker 1:          00:07:22       The property is, the property can't be worth that much. It's just the fact that they can rent it to two people. That's a lot of money, man. Oh my God. This is 1.5 0.5 how big is it? A thousand square feet. Square feet one. That's the size of this studio, right? That's the size of where the mics are inside of here. It's pretty close. A thousand square feet is really, I mean, if you're one dude living by yourself, like maybe you got a dog. Yeah, but like didn't that one dude would just rent? He probably should, unless he's just real simple. Like there's those people that buy those miniature houses. Ever seen those tiny house, tiny house that you want to talk about? Warm whole shit. I got it. I ended that so deep, Dude. I was like, what if I did dance? What if I did tell me how shit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       It's why, you know there's a show that I'm addicted to. It's called life below zero. I watched three episodes. What is it that people in Alaska, I love that show. I watched two episodes the other day in one, actually yesterday, but the one I watched yesterday, there's this dude who lives in a place called, I think it's called Shandell are it's way above the Arctic circle and it's fucking guy lives by himself and apparently he used to be married and he has kids somewhere. Yeah, his name's Glenn Glenville new or something like shout out to Glenn Smart too too, which is weird. He lives solo so low. No one's around. He lives in a room. Not even half that. That's, that's homeboy right there. He lives in a room, not even half the size of this studio and he just has a bunch of shit like stacked in that rule. I maybe it's like I'm exaggerating. Maybe it's half the size. That's his tent above the artists naked there. There's a song

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       this hog, let's show his diesel Odis. See, here's the thing about these things. Like you got to realize that on these shows there's a lot of the stuff they do is just bullshit. They just do it for camera. Like what would it be? Good episode today. Well, maybe I can make my own sauna. Yeah. Make a song. Like what? He'd be really be making a sauna. I don't know. But what this guy does is just, he goes out and shoots Moose and Caribou. Oh, he eats almost exclusively meat. He lives where there's fucking no plants. I mean there's trees grow. You're not growing Jack Shit. Wolves in his yard. He had a shoot wolves once they were in his backyard. Yeah, to shoot them because they were coming for his food. I see him training the wolf's. He starts training heaven. Shit. So you don't really train wolfs he trained those bitch ass half wolves that become dogs.

Speaker 2:          00:09:40       Right. That's they turn into, they turn it to uh, his, uh, his sauna. Wolf's Hisana dogs. Unless you're like beastmaster you have like a special bracelet and you walk through the forest and they'll follow you. They kind of want it to be that right. Never. Beastmaster you remember that show? Fucking do like always had like a hawk landing on his shoulder and shit. Just go like this and a bird land on him. Yeah. It didn't have like a fucking mountain lion or something that hung around with them too and walk with them. Everyone's guardian. Yeah, like here he is. Yeah, those fair, those ferrets are like a pigeon kite pigeons in New York. You know what I mean? The parents distribute messages throughout the forest. Do you know ferrets were illegal in some places for a while as to pets. Too much anal, but people shoving him up their ass.

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       I don't think that's fair. It's they'll get them with a hawk on his hand. Is that an eagle looked at up. Why do people, why were ferreted league? I got it. Nobody thought they were aggressive, which is hilarious. And you think about how many dogs people have that are just ridiculously faces off and shit. I fucking golden retriever attack my golden retriever and bite his face when we were on a run the other day. What do you do? I just pulled them apart and he yelled at the guy who controls fucking dog and what does he do? The guy was so weak like he, the dog polled and the guy comically fell to his ass, feet up in the air from a dog and meets a 70 pound dog. It's not a big dog. Yankton right out. He said like the dog is a problem and it bites things and tries to bite people.

Speaker 2:          00:11:04       I'm like, well you got a bad dog van. Put a fucking muzzle on it or something or figure it out, but he can't even hold the dog. Like there's people that have animals that they're just hoping nothing goes wrong. They have zero control over right thing and this thing pulled and this guy like whoop feet went flying cartoons so weak. And then when I separated the dogs, he tried to pull the dog back. He couldn't pull the dog back. I'm like, come on man, like you shouldn't have this dog. It's not even a big dog. You should have a fucking Chihuahua emasculating moment for a guy to like have another man be like, Hey, what are you doing guys? My control your fucking dog. I don't want to hurt the dog, but the dog is biting my dog. You have to stop it in some ways to do something in some way. So if it takes two instincts, instinct number one is like kick it and knock it away. Push it away. Instinct number two is grab a rock and smash this fucking thing. It's that passion. Fighting

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       that instinct. Yeah, because that dog is like my little buddy. You have to protect yours. Yes. Well he's a sweetie too. Like he doesn't, he's not grounded in anything, any time ever. Right. This is just a fun, just got attacked. Happy dog and this dog's biting onto his face and he's Yiping and I'm trying to figure out what to do and this fucking guy feed up in the air. Whoops. Felt that he was of no use and not. So I have to assume this dog's not going to do anything to me. You know, it's biting me. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with his dog and wants a bite another cause it's not a pit bull or something like that. If it was a pit bull, I would have known like, okay, we got to go wide berth here. Fuck away from this ring.

Speaker 1:          00:12:28       I know how those things behave, but this is just like, why is this dog doing this? That'll be the next, uh, that'll be the next like reality shows fight, fight, fight. The owner, like, you know, the dog's getting a thing and then you're like, all right, well me and you have to fight. Now there's people, there's people that have dogs that don't even understand dogs. They don't know that they have to be the alpha. They don't know that. They don't know how to go, hey, cut the fucking shit. Cause they just get a dog. They just get a dog and they just figure everything. It'll figure itself out. You know, it was bad ass with dogs. Who Whitney Cummings, you know, I just got a puppy and I called her. She called, gave me crazy good advice. Suit. She doesn't fuck around in her house.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       She goes, I walked through my dogs. I don't walk around them. I walked through them. Yeah. She goes and they don't lie on top of me and they don't get to lick my face. I was like, whoa. Yeah, no, she told me she gave doing that. Let me tell you, shout out to her. She gave me so much great advice. She was like, I literally, I was like, hey man, do you have a little bit of time to tell me that? And she, she, I mean like a computer. She was like, yeah, dude, don't do, don't do, don't she like named everything perfectly that she's like, don't make this mistake. Don't do this. People do this shit all the time. It's wrong. She laid it out great. And Nick now, uh, the puppies like almost perfectly potty trained and I just got it. I saved my best friends.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       True adopted dogs. Yeah. She's one of the smartest people I know, but the absolute, but a puppy's an asshole. By the way. Puppies are assholes. Puppies are assholes. So hard to deal with man. And waking up in the middle of the night pissing and shitting, wanting to piss like every two hours. I know, I know. I know. Trust me. I was, I blew, I learned fast that I was like, I was like, it'll sleep a little bit. When was the last time you had a dog? Years ago. Do you have crates to keep being cracked? Right? Yeah. You've got to keep the crate thing. They don't mind. That was the thing. We think what we put in the dog or the kids know they like it. They like it. Yeah. Cause they feel like, well even when she, even when she shits she finds a thing that that feels like it's covering her.

Speaker 1:          00:14:11       She likes to be like covered when she shit. I mean she's a lady first of all. Of course she wants to, she wants to hide her shit. What? Same thing when she goes in the crate. She likes it when my shirts on top of it cause it's like, it feels like it's a kit, a little cave. He knows. The most bizarre to me is people in New York City who live in these little ass apartment stacked on top of each other and they have dogs. Great Danes. And like what is the fuck is this crazy? How are you doing this? Like you have to, that is a job. You have an extra job like it's not like you just let, I can let my dog out in the yard. Hey Buddy, you gotta shit. God open up the door. He's gone. Goes takes a shit there. You got to take it down in an elevator downstairs.

Speaker 1:          00:14:45       What if you're in a walk up, right? You're going to walk down seven flights of stairs at two o'clock in the morning because your dog has diarrhea. Fuck is this. This lady is walking down the street with a God damn horse. That is the one of the biggest dogs I've ever seen. What is that? Mary lives in a 400 square foot, two bed, two bath. My friend's daughter just moved to New York City. She got a job in New York City and she moved to this place where she pays $1,200 for a room that doesn't even have a sink in Manhattan. In Manhattan. Yeah. They have a community bathroom down the hall. She had us, she, she's a hot blade in her room and there's no room for anything. No refrigerator, no, none of that shit. Oh, it's a room. No, bought a room. It's so little 1200 a bed.

Speaker 1:          00:15:29       There's a bed that sits there and then there's like, she has this little tiny area, whereas a shelf and then she has a hot plate that sits on the shelf. That's it. That's it. If you have clothes, you got to stack them up in boxes on the ground. The best shitty in a World Bei Bei $1,200 for a room. If you're a kid, like, cause she's only 21. Um, think of your kid and you move to a New York. How much you make and what do you mean? Are you even making 1200 bucks a month? I mean, you might make your probably clear 400 $500 a week before taxes, right? And then the taxes come. You might be down to four, right? So you, you, what are you doing? You're paying $1,200 and you make it 16. You're, you're living off of $400 a week to walk around and take cabs and get food.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       It's fine. Fuck all. That's literally why I moved to La. When I started comedy, I was going to go to New York and I thought buddy was like, you can be broken la and get away with it. Yes. He's like, you can't be broke in New York. Yeah. When I lived in New York, I was doing road gigs and I couldn't afford to live in Manhattan. So I lived in new Rochelle. I got a place in new Rochelle with a little driveway. I went to like, I was a bottom half of a house and um, look, uh, there's like a little driveway and parked the car right in front of my bedroom. So if someone fucked with it, I could hear it. See it. Yeah. It was the only option that wasn't cheap either. But like living in the city was just impossible. It's like hundreds of dollars a month just for a parking spot.

Speaker 1:          00:16:53       Ever afford that. That's why I moved to La because I saw some, someone was telling me they were like, you can get away with paying 400 a month in La to have a room in a place with roommates. And I was like, God is perfect. Well I think comics are doing it right. Like there's a lot of like Tony Hinchcliffe when he lived out here, when he first moved here, he lived with like three other guys and like they all split the rent. Small one bedroom apartment or two bedroom apartment. You can get away with that and it's fun. It's like it is fun. You know. It's not fun though. The one guy who doesn't make it no shit. He still calls you guys up to hey you think are good to spoke Doritos Dave and you're breaking up. I got to go. I'm on the hill on the hill. Did you?

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       Yeah, but that's always funny cause I was out of the, there's always one, the guys that I moved out here or the guy when I lived with, when I moved out here, they're all doing good stuff, not comics, but they're all doing this stuff, which is wild. This is good. If they're not that they weren't common better. It was easier for me cause I didn't want, yeah. I also think competition in those places gets kind of thick. You know it could, it depends. Some guy gets on some guy, you know as you watch one dude get a lot of like rise and then everyone else is like, why the fuck is he getting so much? Right. It becomes this, you know I lived with, I've only lived with, the only comic I've ever lived with was Dunkin. That was the only for like six months.

Speaker 1:          00:18:10       Love Him. Must, it might not even been six months, somewhere in the neighborhood of six months. I never lived with a comic. I think you got booted out of his house though. He was living with a gal and then they had a little gut of a struggle and you called me up from a motel and I'm like, come on, live with me man. Fuck it. Come on dude. Party this big old house living by myself. Like let's have some fun. And he actually used my isolation tank to get over his breakup. Really? Yeah. He gotten their tank every day. He would smoke weed and get in the tank and think about life and just let it size and wrote a journal and then left it behind. So I've read every page of it. Call them up. I was like, dude, what is all this gay shit?

Speaker 1:          00:18:46       What is this? What do you got here? First couple of pages. I love angel. I want, yeah, you, yeah. You don't mind if I put it online, right page for page. I don't know where that is. It might have got lost in one of my moves. I might just turn up somewhere. I was going to say you should do a time release. Like every day a new page gets released online. It wasn't really that bad. It was just him, you know, like getting out of the tank and just sweat sortings head out. What's the first thing you think of when you get out of the tank? Oh, it's very different every time. I mean, most of the time when I get an attack, I'm just trying to chill out. I've always had, I always have so many plates spinning. You know, there's like so many different things.

Speaker 1:          00:19:20       I'm always thinking about like there's podcasts. Who's the future guests? When am I doing stand up? What, what bit am I working on? Right. Let's go. The UFC is coming up like, Oh have I watched this guy fight before? I got to make sure that I, you know, get my, my, my views in on different styles and stuff and have my ideas about what I think about these match ups. And you don't sleep, you don't sleep. I sleep. You're sleeping there? No in the tank. Oh No, no. I don't sleep in there. Can people save saving the tech? Uh, yes. You definitely can. I would imagine that your own snores. Doe would echo off the walls a little bit and maybe that will wake you up, but I'm sure I've passed out in there before. I'm sure I have many years that I've been doing it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:59       I first got one 16 years ago. Holy Shit. Yeah. That's when I first got a tank. I've got one in 2002 that's wild. Yeah. Do you do the cryo freeze too? They do that too. Yeah man. I really prefer sauna. It takes more time. But, uh, I really like how Saunas make me feel. But cryo gives you a for, I shouldn't say I prefer it. Here's the problem. I have a sauna here, so like I'm biased so I could just turn it on and I'll do it way more often. I have to drive to the cryo place. Park my car. That's a whole clothes off. Climbing a cryo machine here. No, no, no. It's very complicated. And you have to have a license and you're carrying for nitrogen here. Fuck Dude. That's a cryo dude. Jamie would like that. You want to cry? Oh Dude. Hanging around.

Speaker 1:          00:20:45       I was thinking about that one girl that died vegas cause she was doing it without supervision. We'll see. How long was she in a four. She did a different kind. See there's two different kinds. There's the kind that uses liquid nitrogen and then you stand in this liquid nitrogen and in that kind it's only from the neck down. So your head is not being frozen. That's not as effective. It's effective. It definitely does something but it doesn't do as much as the one where you're standing at 250 degree below zero air. That's the one that I go to. That's Cryo healthcare. They're in La on La Cienega and then there are about five miles away from here in woodland hills. So you just getting like a chamber? Yes. Under wearing gloves. Yes. I got to where you were like crocs on your feet, something rubber on your feet, like rubber clogs rather.

Speaker 1:          00:21:31       Um, because you're, you're going to wear socks, socks go up to your ankles are up to your calves rather like because your skin can freeze. Like you can get frostbite. Like I know people that have been in there too long and they've got a little bit of burning sensation on their is too long. The most I've ever done is three minutes and 40 seconds. They don't let you do more than I think a minute and a half on your first one. They want want to make sure that you don't freak out, you know, too sensitive and then you build your way up to three minutes is the Max. The only reason why I went further than that because there was a guy worked there and we were just trying to figure out what you can take. Yeah, I was going to save you. You did it because you want it to.

Speaker 1:          00:22:06       I wanted to see if I have court I could take, did you do it? I've done twice. I think vent, two minutes Max. This for me, I felt like at full I felt like it. Four minutes, I would have had real problems. I was like, I was on the door of real problems at three minutes and 40 seconds your brain start. Do you feel stuff? We'd like, does your head start getting fucked up? It's hard to concentrate. It's hard to stay cool like the whole, the whole deal is just like, stay chill, cool. Kill your you to keep it together. You don't want to freak out. But then my legs started involuntary bucking. They were doing this. That's your body saying this. This isn't, we got to, it was not. It was like, okay, so my rational brain was still like 30% operational. Maybe at that point, maybe 40% you're like, you know, thinking that you couldn't do math problems, you're not thinking clearly.

Speaker 1:          00:22:53       You could do math problems for the first 30 seconds and then you'd be like, holy fuck, holy fuck. What if you just thought about one math problem over and over in your brain and circulated that shit until the end and you'd be focused on it so hard then. Then when you started to forget how to do it, then you know you're out and you can't do it anymore. Well one thing I do do is I do that Wim Hof breathing method or I take these gigantic breaths and then I let out 20% and then I take another breath like as deep as I can get my lines, let out 20% and I concentrate on doing that and time flies by. That's what they do. That's what those deep divers to write those guys, they go to those, uh, don't they do that? Did they? Cause they learn how to store breath.

Speaker 1:          00:23:28       I don't know what they do. We were seeing those videos with those guys. They dive like, you know, and those dive tanks that they have set up, but the way they do it, it looks like they in tons of breath, they let a little bit, they keep taking it in and sit there like just storing it in there and you know, in the sax, in their lungs. I would think that that's not just storing oxygen to that you'd be storing carbon dioxide. Right? Cause you're not breathing out. Yeah. But they'd breathe out a little bit at a time. Hello, fuck. Do you convert oxygen to carbon dioxide? I've always just, just uh, accepted that I never thought of about the fact that air goes in. Why isn't air going out without fuck is happening and it's only going right there. Like how's it turned into carbon dioxide?

Speaker 1:          00:24:01       A little dude. It's just going in there and then it comes, right? Like that's it. I converted. Yeah. Right now that's ridiculous. Mushy or conversion machine. That's what we all are. Big Conversion, carbon dioxide conversion machines. You learn that kind of stuff. Like of, of how quickly things happen when like, like my college roommate had gout. You know what I mean? We're like blood turns around front jeff at that. That's crazy. So like it's your, it's like your fingers or your hand. Anything we're blood has like a long feet. Yeah. Fee. It's usually legs and feet. And I never understood until I looked it up when he had it and I was like, how do you get gout? And everything online is like 50 plus is at risk. You know like high blood pressure. Go to music. It was 20 years old. Jesus shouldn't had it. You know they call it King's disease.

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       Yeah. Cause they were fat and ate and drank all day. Just drink wine, their feet, you know, fucking awesome. That is. Especially when everybody else is starving. If you'd be like, please sir, let me rest my swollen dead feed on your head. I've been watching biking's I get into that show vikings. I mean I've never seen him pretty God damn good. She's good. I was super skeptical. People telling me it was good. I was like, it's unregular TV. How the fuck could it be? And he was on, it was on history channel. Oh yeah. Which is another one. It's on history channel, but it's a, but it's a drama. How the fuck it's based on historical facts apparently. Right. Ragnar Ragnar Loft Brooke, that's his name, but it's fucking Badass show. But one of the thing that's crazy about the shows, he really stopped thinking, well this is really how it worked.

Speaker 1:          00:25:24       Like how king's treated regular people. Totally. They really got away with that and all they were was just a regular guy. I didn't have super powers. No, they didn't. And everybody would just bow down to him, sire and they would kiss the rings and they would just let them do whatever the fuck they wanted. It's so weird. Fear of death, dude. It's crazy that even the army would listen to this guy like that. Anybody would let it and it catches guys weird or that the army listened to one dude. Occasionally they will go fuck you, and they'd killed the guy and then a new guy would rise. That's what we should be doing. We should do all that shit. Now, today, did you see the video of trump talking about taxes? Uh, to what he said, fuck, I can check it out. I'm going to charge you 25 be sent to grow my instagram.

Speaker 1:          00:26:04       I sent it out yesterday. Fucking amazing that that's the price. There's two parts of me, man. There's one part of me that loves this. Oh Dude, I love it. One part of me that's god Ha Craig material. There's so many fakes and phoneys and ridiculous career politicians that have to watch this guy. Yeah. Say, listen motherfuckers, you're going to pay 25% taxes and everybody goes crazy. Tears. Yeah. Cause like they can't believe he's really saying it, but it's the stuff that they would say to if they didn't have any reservations. Well it's maybe, but I think a lot of those guys are just like that. Let's play it because it's hilarious. I'm dropping

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       25% tax on gene Jana. And I said to somebody that is really the Messenger. The Messenger is important. I could have one man say we're going to tax you 25% and I can say another. Listen, your mother fuckers, man, I'm telling you, man, look

Speaker 2:          00:27:10       not in favor of the wall. I'm pro immigration. I'm not a favor of these ice busts and all that jazz, but shit like that one's me over. I said, well, I just love the fact that the guy's the fucking president. And he said, listen, you motherfuckers, you got to pay 25% taxes. It says eight years before the campaign. It doesn't say how many years. Oh, I love, and I forgot. Oh, is it? Is it 2011 it's old. He looks the sense, but what's, you know what's so funny? I was talking about on a stage, it's still ridiculous. I'm so tired of being yelled at by like online about people hate him. Like, listen, I'm not a huge fan of them either, but so many people are like, I hate him. I hate him. I hate him that now. I kind of liked him. Exactly like, do you know how enough people say Shit?

Speaker 2:          00:27:50       They're like, fuck you. I'm so tired of you telling me your opinion. It's all the same to do. Also what annoys me is when someone goes fucking moron, that's like, that's it. That's all. That's what you did. You, you, you, you put like, that's not doing anything by going, hey, trump shuck my dick. It's all right, dude. Well, you got 'em. Here's my take on that. If it's that, if it's fucking moron, you're not even supposed to listen. That's supposed to not even go in. I know because there's not a, this is not effective communication, so if you engage that guy, don't I just completely waste your time. Even if you get upset at you completely waste your time. I wipe it away, but I see it and I'm like, oh, come on. This is the one that gets me as Nazi fucking Nazi Nazi.

Speaker 2:          00:28:27       Oh yeah, he's a Nazi and you're a Nazi fascist. They throw these words around. They really don't even know what the fuck they're saying. Like if you really think that everybody looks likes trump is a Nazi, you're missing. That's insane. You're missing a giant point. You're, you're fucking up everything. You're ruining this conversation. You're right about a lot of the shitty does wrong here, but as soon as you say he's a Nazi, right, and that there's Nazi, everyone's a Nazi. Well then when real Nazis come around, you've get better. Have a better name. Yeah. Yeah. You can't with the court call Nazis, you can't fucking take the word Nazi and apply it to shit. That's not Nazis. That's dangerous. Like that's a sale. Like call someone a murderer. Why'd you call him a murderer? Because he yelled and insult at that man, okay, that's not a murderer.

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       Right? Like you can't do that same thing. We call someone a Nazi. That's not a nonsense. He might be a moron. He might be a fool. He might be a into trump just because he's a dumb guy and he likes the fact there's a white guy in office. But that doesn't mean he's a Nazi. But it's also like the, the biggest problem that I have is like you're, it's still illegal to be an asshole. It's not illegal to be a dick. Right. If someone's, if someone says something you don't like, right. It's not against the law. Right. So like this idea of you tagging someone like that, the biggest criminal in the world because they said something you don't like. It's crazy to me like, well, people are allowed to not fucking think what you think is right.

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       Right Brian?

Speaker 2:          00:29:43       They're trying to redefine what's acceptable by calling words violence. Like they're calling saying hang speech. Hate speech is real. Right. I don't know though. See, it's fun. Little Fun. It's real. If you say something like, fuck the Jews, I hate all Jews. Jews should die. That's hate speech.

Speaker 3:          00:29:58       Okay. It's to me it's this. If you set, if a guy said, fuck the Jews, I disagree with what he says. Well you should say, how do you fuck them? Fuck them. Genuine the front and about. Fuck Dude, go go around the world. What he did kvetch after. No, but I think it's like Wah, Wah, Wah, but listen, that person, that person, what hate speech to me is like a, it's just a big, huge term that can encompass so many things. I don't really know what it is, right? It does. It incite violence. The devices, the Jews does that inside violence. It shouldn't. No, that's just that. If I said fuck your shirt, it only inside the fund you to terrorist shirt

Speaker 2:          00:30:33       close as soon as you, the way you said shirt, I was like, yeah, leading a shirt revolution you have fuck, shut your fucking shirt off too. Fucking short broke. Certainly Bro, you surely way fuck the Jews works is if someone also thinks fuck the Jews and then you like find likeminded shitheads but that's going to happen no matter what. But it's not going to have, if you don't say it then. So the idea is like, can you suppress it? Here's the problem with stopping hate speech is like who's to decide because they're pushing the boundary of what? Hate speech so far. Right? Like if you call a trans woman, a man that's hate speech like that, there's, it's kind what did, that's just an accident. Yeah, it's still accidental hate speech. Why? That's crazy. Because we live in a new world now. See, I can't accept that you don't go online and now

Speaker 3:          00:31:20       if you do it out of malice, like if you're, if someone's like, Hey, I'm Margaret and a guy goes, no, no, I'm not going to call you that good there I that then that's them being proactively prejudice, right? Them being a dick, they're being an asshole.

Speaker 2:          00:31:34       But some people are of the opinion that this is all nonsense. But if it's an, I'm not taking, taking their point. But I do want to play devil's advocate because I've had conversations with people who are pretty intelligent people than to say, this is all nonsense. And then this trans stuff, and this is, this is a trendy thing that people were really getting into in summary Bore really distorted. Their perceptions of reality is really distorted and they're being talked into this because it's a thing that a lot of people are doing it. And so they're getting, and um, I hear that and I go, wow, I don't know if I believe that people are willing to transition to another sex because they're confused. That's a big leap. It's a giant ass leap. But here's the other leap. The leap is you telling someone whether or not they feel a certain way. And then the other leap, here's the other leap. What do you give a fuck if Bruce Jenner wants to become Caitlyn Jenner, I'll call our Kaitlin. I don't care. But if she thinks I'm gonna stop making fun of her, she's out of her fucking mind.

Speaker 3:          00:32:28       That's what it, but that's what I mean. So you should be allowed to just, you should be allowed to mock at a freedom that you would anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:32:33       Every six foot, three person would size 14 high heels gets mocked. Just listen around clock because

Speaker 3:          00:32:40       anybody would get made fun of for any of that in any other way. Yes. If you used to be a girl or you used to be a dude, and now you're a girl and someone's gonna make fun of you, and that's just the price you pay for being a person. But people make fun of everyone for everything. Everything. You have red hair, right? Is My whole life, your whole life. But what? I can't start a group against it being like people trying enough of this enough. No, just it is what it is. Everyone has these flaws. The kick of Ginger Ginger Day. That wasn't cool. No, but no, but you know what's so funny about that? Those guys were so subversive. What they're doing is showing how quickly people jump onto things and go, yeah, fuck them. Fuck them all. So they're so smart. I love that episode because it was like that could be a real, and that's how dumb people are.

Speaker 3:          00:33:20       People in the real world have told me, I've been through it. I wonder when we kick of Ginger Day is they buy that's real to them. But that's, that's by the way I played, uh, I played golf with a buddy at the country club that, uh, Caitlyn Jenner belongs to. My first question does, does she hit from the women's season, the men's tees and the guy with me goes, she hits from the women's taste. I'm like, Bull Shit. See, that's bullshit. Is it bullshit? Because you, you, you're a fucking Olympian. You, you were, you still the difference between teasing the men's tees? I mean like distance 30, 40 yards. Yeah. Ah, yeah. That's like doing those pushups on your knees. Bullshit. Yeah. Good on your toes. But, but, but wait a minute. He used, uh, she was, she had, she has man structured muscle and then go away. That's all gone.

Speaker 3:          00:34:04       No Way. Muscle. There's no muscle while she's still pretty fucking jam. Not Really, man. I said no, I'm going to be honest. I don't think she works out at all. And she's old already, so it's not like your body has, I still say you go back to her, but she still has a Dick, right? Nope. She had the operation. Cut it off. It's hot. Is it gone now? You're okay now you get women's tees up. Dick was there. You gotta go. You gotta go back to the black. Yeah. There's a lot of fence riders out there in the Trans World. Pick it. You gotta pick dude, you gotta come, you gotta come or go. That's another thing they're saying, this is this, I don't agree with this, is they're saying that if you are a person who is male and likes women, if you are unwilling to date a trans woman, it's because you are a transphobic bigot, including if that Trans Woman's still has a penis.

Speaker 3:          00:34:52       That is, that's of no regard. You know the funny thing of the, of all this is I'm so happy to just be a CIS gender men, like a fucking, I'm so happy to not have to worry about it. I don't have to worry about it. No one's going to call me a bigot for not liking a subset of a kind of a thing that I like. I just like a whoa. I like women. That's all I know. I like, that's it. I'm fine. They'll come around to you soon. Take [inaudible]. They got Bruno Mars. He didn't see it coming home on that was said. What did they say? Appropriating black culture. Cultural appropriation. You see how many people came to his rescue though? A bunch of people were like, that's bullshit. He's a musician. He, what has he done that was he appropriating black culture made zinging awesome.

Speaker 3:          00:35:29       Made good music. Yeah. That's all he did that billionaire songs, a wonderful song and he made some fucking great songs. Artists. It's bullshit to think people now can stab at anything that you're like now you're just trying to cause a stir. They try it. They take swings and sometimes don't work. Like remember when they were trying to block bossy? It's like fuck off. Like okay, just put it out. Just want to put it out out there. Trying to put it out and just giving it a shot. Yeah. Bruno Mars, they shut us down so fast and he didn't say anything back. Good for him. That's my favorite shit. It's kind of like, you know how like Samsung and all these other phone companies, they make ads about iphones, you know other, all their ads are based on fuck I iphones. Apple never makes a response. Of course.

Speaker 3:          00:36:09       That's the coolest movies to be like whatever man. Yeah, that Samsung ad is stupid. That's when they walk past. The people waiting in line for an office. Had those. Samsung always been like, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's like the annoying little brother and you're like, oh dude, get the fuck outta here. We're just do your own thing. They make the best second best phones, set gear, the second best phone in the world and make the best second best facet. You're number one at making the number two phones sort of the Google phone is probably better. I think the Samsung probably sells. What do you, what about this ad as that was the Imac? I'm a Mac. I'm a PC. I'm a Mac. I'm a PC. Yeah, those were so dumb. But those are in the nineties man. Yes, those what I'm saying? I'm saying currently they don't run any ads like that guy from drag me to hell, right?

Speaker 3:          00:36:51       No. What was the movie? He was Justin Long. What was that movie he was in? He was in a great fucking harm movie. Like a real classic. Can't be harmed movie Kevin Smith's one. No, no, no, no. He was in Tusk. Right, but that's not what I'm talking about. There was one that he was in put up, pull back it up with that. Right though. That is funny. I forgot about those ads. That's how long ago that way using windows to write lately I use windows 10 it's fucking great. There's nothing wrong with it. Like windows 10 is in my opinion, just as good narrowed. Pretty boy. Oh, they're arguing with each other. Mac versus pc. Windows 10 is just as good as, uh, as Mac in terms of like, it's a little different but it doesn't crash. I don't know. I'm not having any problems with it.

Speaker 3:          00:37:37       It works great, but I'm not even going to lie. I'm not gonna be one these people, you know, like, like, like, like james is a fucking tech genius. He knows wizard. Yeah, he's a genius. I when someone, when someone says the accused of like, why do you have a Mac? And someone goes, well judy, it's great for the arts and it does this and this. I don't even lie. I go, dude, I just pull up jeepers creepers in that. But there was another one. It was him that was a good one. That was a good one. Fuck you guys. The Guy who drove the old truck, the mean deviled guy with the wings that drove the old truck loved it. It probably made 18 bucks. It was probably, she has 18 bucks. The other movie through. You're thinking of die hard, but no, no, no. He was in, um, see, go to his, uh, you know that you don't have no, it's good that he does. The restaurant movie was pretty funny too. I am going to be, he was definitely in a horror movie like recently. No, no, no. Just go to the stop looking at images. You're like a little kid, but you're fucking instagram can't, you can't look at like real words. Where's the picture of the movie? He was, what is that right

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       there in there? What's that? Trump. What does that say? Track. Confusing him with somebody else. Yeah. You gotta be, there was like a some hell movie where like, he, he had to go to hell. She'll drag me to hell or something like that. I feel like drag me to hell is a, uh, a movie about a chick that was like murder to came back to life. Yeah. That's a great, that's the story. That's a great story. I think that's what it was. I never saw it in that though. He's the boyfriend. He is. He's in that one too. When you're talking time.

Speaker 4:          00:39:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:06       No, no. It was just a year ago. Let me see what it looks like.

Speaker 4:          00:39:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:12       Okay. That is it. That is it. Yeah. What the fuck? I never saw that. That's that is it. It's um, it was like, uh, uh, which, yup. That's it. Clay, Clay Dalton. There was another movie that sounded like drag me to hell. What does that, is that guy shoving his fist in her throat? I was a good movie. That was a good, stupid movie that drag me to hell movie. That is what the name of it was. I was right. I was right. But I was confused. There's one with a woman, like there's a woman on the cover. It looks like she's like a silhouette and she's screaming. It's something about drag maybe dragged you to hell.

Speaker 4:          00:39:46       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:46       Is that what it is? Drag me to hell. It's another one. Same month. Same movie. It's a movie. Yeah, but that's not it. You just named that you were like the woman's screaming. I did. I did, but that's not the, that's not the same cover. Perfect. Easily issue houses in the back. That's hard. That's not it. No. There was another one. I might, I might have the name completely wrong for the movie, but it was about a woman. See this is hard because I didn't actually watch it, but it was about a woman who got killed and she came back and got the people got her, I don't know, like high plains drifter. You remember that?

Speaker 4:          00:40:17       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       Clint Eastwood. Oh yes. He was killed. Yeah. Came back to life and fucked everybody up in the town. Yeah. That's good. Western harm. Western horror. Right, but a sneaky western harm movie. Like you don't really exactly know what's going on. Where's, there's not a western horror anymore. Do they do shit like that was the last western horror. He said there was a western Ufo movie. Cowboys and aliens. Remember that? Yeah, but that's a piece of shit, I guess. You know what you could call now, like you could do western, like no country for old men. Could be like a western. That was a horror movie. That guy was a monster. Yeah. I don't know. A tour or if it's like more like a terror. Terror. Yeah, like a terror. And that guy was a monster. I mean, might as well be fucking awesome. How good is that fucking actor?

Speaker 1:          00:40:56       What does that gentleman's name with the crazy hair? Uh, the mop on his head. Come on. What's wrong with me? Sorry. What movie? No country for old men. Uh, Javier Bardem. Yeah, he's so good. He's a beast. Like you really believe that guy with murder, but you go, well, you know when you look in some actor's eyes and you're like, ah, something real. So inside of that he has that thing where you're like, oh fuck. You know, some actors just are like, oh, they're just playing a character. Yeah. When they don't have it, it drives me nuts. Now. I know that guy looking at shit. Look at us. Look at his eyes. Zoom in on his eyes. Chan movie. Is this from, is that a new movie? Loving Pablo? I don't know. Oh, Jesus Christ. He looks exactly like him. He did it again. A bunch of weight for that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       He's always been kind of a thick dude though. But look at the picture of him above on the blue shirt right above that and for sure he's kind of a thick dude. Nah, not like Pablo. Picture that public picture looks. He's about 70 pounds. Ever. Look at that. Look at a fucked up was psycho. He was a good psycho. That moves a fucked up movie cause it just ends. Yeah. That's why the country for old men like what? Sometimes bad guys get away. Fuck off. Won't Coen brothers. It was coen brothers, wasn't it? He was Frankenstein, Frankenstein, Frankenstein, all the new monster movies. He's got bleached blonde hair. It's gay Frankenstein. That's what happens. The guy dies on the operating table getting his cheeks done. Gay freaking inside was that. He's taking it back to suck your deck.

Speaker 1:          00:42:20       Go to the picture above that cheese. Get to to Dickson his neck. A set of bolts, the Tan suit above it right there at Tan suit right there. Yeah, look at that. God does the gay Frankenstein. Yeah. Is he a but it's selling you a house. I'll kill you. Always a bond villain. That's right. He was a bar. That dead dude's a beast. But the problem with a guy like that is every movie that he does that's goofy, takes away from degrading way you see him. If you see him in a movie like this, right? Like every movie, no country for old men is so 100% legit. That if he does a bond movie and he's in some stupid karate scene where he's got to like throw sidekicks, the guy kicks him in the balls and he bends over and the guy or caught something, it looks corniest shit it takes,

Speaker 3:          00:43:06       but there's like only so many actors that got away like Daniel Day Lewis. He's like the only dude that only did shit he wanted to do. Almost everybody else does things where you're like, why did you do that? Right? I mean they all like, they all have to, we'll nobody fucked it harder than Dinero. Dinero dude did some of the greatest movies of all time and possibly the worst movies in history. It's done toilet water. Just mostly toilet water ever since. Did you see, did, did the output Chino paternal thing come out yet? When does that come up? Have you seen that pregame? Yes. Dude, look at the picture. He looks identical. I mean it's fucking creepy. One next month, next week show the Joe Paterno knew those kids are getting molested. Come on dude. Of course. Of course. He looking at, he looks at it and looking identical and everybody knew the guy was a pervert.

Speaker 3:          00:43:53       He was running a fucking children's charity where he's taking care of kids. I don't want to sound like one of those guys, but I don't give a shit. I remember when he got caught, when it, when it, when it came out, I said to a bunch of people, he's going to die soon. Within like a month he'll die per sure. And sure enough, he died shortly thereafter. This whole thing. Yeah. Cause I knew it was going to kill him. Oh God. That Sandusky thing. So in this scene right here and the trailer, he's saying his wife is like, his wife goes, uh, well, you know, he was, he was with so and so. Their kids' names and he goes, he was with [inaudible] like his own kids. And then it hits him that he's like, he was watching them. So then it hits him like May, Oh fuck he, oh

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       jb. Fuck my kids. It's insane. What the fuck man, that wasn't that long ago. No, when was that? That Sandusky arrest? 12, 2012. So you should probably third 2013 easy thing is they've already gotten rid of all their sanctions and whatnot. Penn state's already back all their penalties and whatnot. I'll tell you what the real quick money baby will crazy thing is the original investigator and to Sandusky turned up, murdered his, uh, they found his laptop with a like a destroyed hard drive. And uh, I think they never found his body. I think he, I think he fucking vanished. Trial was in 2012. 2012. Okay. So that was a trial. So he's arrested in 2011 find the guy who was the original investigator who turned out missing, either turned up missing or murdered and his laptop, uh, was found with a destroyed hard drive. Like someone clearly got ahold of this guy that he be fucking iced him because he was going to destroy penn state.

Speaker 2:          00:45:33       I mean, he was going to take down this tie billion dollar industry. What happened to your car? Wow. Um, see what you get the story scroll, make it larger there so I could read it with my old eyes. 10 years ago, prosecutor in Center County, Pennsylvania took the day off work and vanish. Since then, the case of rager car has been one of the most intriguing and to, I don't know if I'm saying his name, write, g. R. I. C. A. R. Kris Carr. External. Truecar, truecar. Nowhere is one of the most intriguing talked about missing persons stories in the country. Investigators have taken dives to the bottom of lakes, dug up a grave, chase more than 300 reported sightings from Arizona to North Carolina, drop flyers all over Slovenia. Consulted a psychic, interviewed a member of Hell's angels and enlisted NASA technology, but no one's been able to find the veteran disk ditch district attorney who was 59 when he disappeared.

Speaker 2:          00:46:22       He went missing that Friday morning, April 15th, 2005 left behind a live in girlfriend, beautiful and successful daughter and a bank account that was supposed to fund a fast approaching retirement. Oh, here's where the problem was. He drove a red mini cooper. Oh, well that was fun. Just make people kill himself. As far as hard evidence goes, it's a ball. The police had the best lead they got was a sighting of a woman who has not been identified. Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, but let's listen. Find out the, the, the conspiracy because the spirit was that he was a part of the Sandusky investigation. Prevailing the serum. This is the side d. Did you Google send Dusky? There it is. Okay. 2011 when Penn state coordinator, Jerry Sandusky, got arrested in charge of sexually abusing boys. Where's vield that? Dzhokhar who decided notch charged Sandusky when his first victim came forward in 1998 Dzhokhar cited a lack of evidence.

Speaker 2:          00:47:13       The intrigue already simmering and Dzhokhar's case exploded. Sluice desperately trying to find a link between the two cases, but investigators said there's no evidence that your car's appearance disappearance had anything to do with sending Dusky crimes. Hmm. That's not what I've read in another story. Cis Guy Saying, I don't think it was a great stretch. He was one of those guys have very strong sense of justice and professional discipline. In light of what evolved and came to beats closed, I speak as a forensic pathologist who's done some so many suicides over the years and what can bring someone to that point. It's pure conjecture, factual knowledge. Hold on a second. Go back up. Still Stop scrolling. It says, the forensic pathologist said he considered writing a book about your car, his ties to the Sandusky case and whether or not it lead to suicide. So he said it was not enough evidence you'd have found him.

Speaker 2:          00:47:57       When people kill themselves, they want to be found. That's why they killed himself. And sometimes most of the time, sometimes they just go in the woods and blow their brains out, but in the fucking woods, you know you don't, he got rid of all that. You know how many people disappear in the woods every year? Thousands and in North America, but a guide this prominent in his, like in his work and in his life that has like that many, he's got too many trails. Do you know what I mean? Mini Cooper, that was isn't that fucking thing. He's like, I got a backpack and a bullet and I'm just going to fucking high deep enough to use all my water. 1600 people missing from our public lands without a trigger. A lot of those people are hiking and she lesson on every year. Okay, I'm wrong. It's like ever, I've been reading people at Vegan method.

Speaker 2:          00:48:36       It's about this, that this happens a lot or was it, but that one was saying 1600 people are missing. You know what I'm getting? Here's where I'm getting my, how many people killed themselves outside? Here's what I'm getting my information from Bobcat goldthwait movie about big foot. I just realized where I'm getting my numbers from because he has a movie called Willow Creek and it's all about a big foot size that people are creeped out with a growing number of missing persons international park. Yeah, but a lot of these people go fucking hiking. They don't go to kill themselves. It's just people being foolish. Well, here's the thing, man, you don't have buddy of mine found a skull when he was elk hunting humans, Goldman skull while elk on how long has that has to be dead for to be fucking deteriorate like that. She was mean.

Speaker 2:          00:49:13       It was deteriorated like at first of all, animals would get to it almost immediately. They smell it. Birds come down. They started taking it apart. Coyotes find it. Everything finds to be clean down to the skull. That's got to be quick. Really? Yeah, you'd be, you'd be surprised. They'll clean you down to nothing in a couple of days. Holy Shit. You'd be down to bones and day. It's like that happens all, it's if there's a population of animals that are scavengers that are near your body. Dude, a buddy of mine shot a deer. Okay. And um, it wasn't the best shot in the world. So he decided to let the deer bed down to die. Like sometimes you'll hit the deer like in one long or something like that. It wasn't the best shot and the deer bed down and it was dark. It was getting dark like he shot at last light where you legally allowed shoot.

Speaker 2:          00:49:55       So they said we're going to come back in the morning cause it's 30 degrees outside. The meat would be fine. They go back in the morning, there's nothing gone. The coyotes ate everything except the fucking head. Like, I mean everything. Like he didn't get any of the rib meat. All the organs were gone. The legs were gone to down to the bone. He said he'd never seen anything like it. 300 pound mule deer. It's a big animal gone. He said he saw like six or seven coyotes that day. So he knew that coyotes were in the area. But you just take a chance. He just like, you could do one of two things. Either bumped the animal, which means you, you go and it gets filled up with adrenaline because it knows you're coming close to it and then it runs and then they can run for a mile before they expire. Or you just let it bed down there peacefully. It'll just lay down and die. So that's what he chose. His choice was just let it lay down and die with the coyotes. Got to it. Fuck Dude. 300 pound animal to seven, eight coyotes, whatever it was that did it. Maybe they called, maybe other ones came from fucking half a mile away. I mean Yo, this is deer. Yo, this guy left. There's a fucking fresh, it's Mike from the westwoods. Yeah, I think he was in an area with no wolves,

Speaker 3:          00:51:01       so I think it was just all coyotes. Coyotes. The coyotes out here in la are so small. They're like little tiny house dogs. They're not like, he had a little like bitch, frail, weird. Like where I golf up in the mountain up there. We there all the time and they sit and they wait for you to pass before they can go across, you know, through the fairway and stuff, but they're like little house dogs. They're like 15 pound house dog. We are lucky. Those things are here. This is the sort of the truth because totally they weren't here. They'd be rats everywhere. Yeah, they eat every throws. Motherfuckers keep the rats in check to keep the rabbits and check. There's a system. There's an ecological system and it makes us uncomfortable because we don't like to think about our own mortality and something that wants to eat us, but I like coyotes.

Speaker 3:          00:51:40       I like them. I had a chance to kill a coyote. They killed one of my chickens, but I'm pretty sure that she had, I'm pretty sure she had puppies or cubs, I guess they would cubs. Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty sure she had chicken. Could have had it come into, you know, didn't could've run its mouth and chicken has a comment. How about that? Jim is bound to go down and that chicken, you have a common, my daughter went on rabbits and I'm going to eat you. My daughter's got rabbits. Uh Oh. We're going to take care of it. You're not going to take care of it. You're gonna play with those things twice and then you're going to leave him alone. No, no. We're going to take care of it. Of course they don't take care of it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       Yeah, I'll give a fuck about those rabbits because they have a dog, right? Dog and jostling. Say you. Oh, he lies down. They rub his belly, cause kisses. He runs around in circles. You throw something, he chases it. It's way better. Nothing grab it just sits there. You go near it, bite your finger. Oh, you can't throw that fucking thing. But anyway, the rabbit, uh, they live in the chicken coops, big ass chicken coop and they follow the chickens around. And today one of the rabbits was trying to eat the other chickens ass. And so it's just falling around literally with his little rabbit face buried in this chicken's asshole. And just in this chicken is trying to get away. But I kind of liken, it was just bouncing around. I mean knows to asshole all around the entire chicky case for like five minutes. It was so rigid.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       There's a sub category on porn hub for that. There's got to be chicken rabbit porn on there. Probably. Yes. Probably animate though. Yes. Yes. Like enemies, subcategories of porn. Some of the anime shit that I stumbled upon is so fucking like the technical stuff is this stuff that freaks me out the most. It's weird. People love people. I don't know who likes watching a girl get fucked by like 19 technicals, like jamming her eyeballs or mouth and her butthole and her and she had people

Speaker 2:          00:53:25       jerk off to that. Started off with with Japanese. For some reason somebody gave me an explanation why Japanese dude like that. Yeah. I think the explanation is that Japanese porn, you're not allowed to show insertion penetration. Yeah, it blurs. You can't even show cartoon Dick's going into Vaginas, but you can show tentacles. Ah, Shit. That makes sense. So the fact that technicals look remotely similar to Dick's, they've decided to just go with tentacles and your mouth and spit flying out of your mouth and, and they can't show jazz. They can do, but they can show technical juice. You know what? They can show where the ges is all pixelated. Like you can see the ges through a prism dancing, jazz pixelation. You can't see the actual like hd four k ages. Nobody like that would be too much for cages. When I was a kid, you couldn't have hard ons in porn magazines.

Speaker 2:          00:54:19       They didn't have hard ons. All the dudes had to have like limp dicks. What? It was a law. It was a federal law. You better put that. You better get that dead serious. Like these guys had half hard Dick's. They're always like half hard and it was so confusing because you'd be a little kid. You Dick would be like a fucking total. What's wrong with mine and you? You'd be so horny. And he'd be looking at this magazine like this guy's right there and he's not even horny. He's right next to me. He's like barely interested. There was a lot they had to have good limp dicks. That's the trick. Right? See that's what's fun inside lived. He couldn't have a mushroom Kaplan. I'm a girl. I'm a grower. Not show her. Yeah, you'd have to have a real hog, like a heavy one. I'm nice when I'm thick, but when I'm soft I can't be in the magazine side a bit about it.

Speaker 2:          00:55:02       Before that the girl would be like her, her mouth be open lipstick and her lips purse and her tongue hanging out in the dude would have his limp Dick rested on her back like a drowning victim. He pulled from a lake. It's like what is this? And then you just take the time to get a hard on before we took these pictures, man, the fuck. It's so weird that that's a law. That's a fucking, that's all crazy standards and practices. A certain companies are as like, listen, we'll let you show penises, but they can't be filled with blood. I don't believe it's standards and practices. I think it was a federal law, but why would will be the difference of showing pre vhs tapes. Once vhs tapes came along, then people got to watch actual hard porno and there was like a loophole. There was a loophole that existed because the pornographic magazines, they weren't allowed to show insertion and they weren't allowed to show erections.

Speaker 2:          00:55:50       So there was this, it was as weird and it wasn't that they couldn't show the lips of the vagina. They had to be covered up by like hair. Right. It was something like that. Like they couldn't show hustler always did though. I think, well, they were the first one to do it. Playboy never did. I know I always had bush. Playboy would have like bear, you'd barely see Bush, you know, you'd see like a shadow of a Bush, like girls looking pretty. Right. Whereas hostler was like, let me watch you piss shit on his guy's chest. Page one Pfister asshole. Come on with. It was a different thing, you know? But when, when we would find these magazines like,

Speaker 1:          00:56:25       oh, he's in the woods. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have a whole bit that's based on a true story about fun and that what Larry Flint's like trials are kind of about. I think so. I think some of them were about that. Yeah. But see, obscenity is one of those weird things. And I know we attributed to, uh, Vincent Scalia, but people corrected me. Judge Scalia is that his name? But it's not him that says Scalia, that guy, it's not him that said this. It's another guy who said this. I don't know what pornography is, but I know when I see it. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well there's another version of that too that's like, I don't know what blank is, but I know it when I see it. Right, right. There's a few, probably the, probably a few of those that erroneously attributed to people, but, um, there's a guy named Max hardcore.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       Do you remember that guy was a porn actor? Yeah. That guy went to jail for obscenity and he did hard time and he had some hard to watch stuff. Like he had stumped some stuff. You're like, wait a minute, what? Like I found out about it because people weren't like, hey man, this is the great stuff to jerk off to. Right. They were like, why you got wash this? What in the fuck is this? This guy used a speculum to open this girl's asshole. He pissed in her asshole and then he put a straw and made her drink his piss out of her own asshole. I gotta get Outta here for a second. I got to go finish up.

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       But it was like there was a lot of like really, really fucked up stuff website that basis. Do you know he fucked? Do you ever heard of that? That's all they do is fucked up crazy. Like there's nothing sexual about it. It's just, it's just like defacing some buses fucked. But the point is that this guy went to jail for that. Like nobody else almost did prime to battle obscenity charges in Connecticut and Cincinnati Rather. Um, that's in 1,998 though. 25 years in prison. Wow. That's incredible. Porn magnate and Haas or publisher, they're like, wow, that's crazy. Oh wait a minute. Chart the same low cow where a judge and jury sentenced him to 25 years in prison more than 20 years ago that he did. So he did he actually go to jail time? He served time, but yeah. Wow. He was living in Columbus where I'm from and he set up his big house, which he, from what I heard, he had played on making it like a playboy mansion type place and it was right next door to the Columbus School for girls and I think that causes some of the first problems for him.

Speaker 1:          00:58:41       Well, it was just prospect. That's just smart. That's a smart real estate. Yeah. It's a good place to, if you're going to be decent and shot a house near Lake. Yeah, man. That just setting up shop, just learning the territory, location, location, location. If you're a coyote, you know where the cats live. Well that's like guy like perverts. I got into selling ice cream to kids. It was was like you can't play them. That's very intuitive. It's like people think of that and to dismiss that, that's not a big deal. Like the Larry Hall that Larry Flynt Hustler think that's a very big deal. It's a very big deal. They were trying to push this guy in jail for something that people enjoy buying. Yep. Cause I bought it. Yeah, they liked it. That went for you got a hustler. Yeah. Awesome. What do you guys get his hand

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       in his pants got hustler play in pocket pool. Hot Tub. Like they like it. They want to buy his product and you're like, no, you can't like it. What the fuck? It's my favorite thing in the world. You can't tell me what I like. Yeah. I mean there was, this wasn't that long ago, man. Think about that 98 that's a 20th season. That's crazy. 20 years ago I almost went to jail. I remember going with my dad to the movie rental place by his house and had one of like those back rooms. No. Yeah. You know what I mean? Saloon doors to come in and as like a kid, my dad would be like, where are you going? It was like, oh look at a section over here. And then he'd be on the other side and he tried to like sneak in to take like a peep.

Speaker 3:          00:59:56       But even like the boxes and then they got smart too. They put covers over the boxes. So you get to like move a thing back to see what the box was. Well the thing that weird feeling was when you would go through those beads and you would be in that room with those other perverts or just like super uncomfortable to be near each other. We're all going to be doing the same thing in 20 minutes. One time I went to an actual porn store. What is it? What do you mean? Like a hardcore store. I was like x, x, x videos like a shop and shit. Like they sold dildos and videos. Right. And that's all they sold. That was their big like let's stop pretending it's got the shit, cut it out. I'm going to go to the back room of a mom and pop store, which says adults only.

Speaker 3:          01:00:36       No, no, this is like the whole store. And you just felt so weird and the guy behind the counter is talking to me like, hey man, what's up? I'm like, hi, you fucking talk to me. I'm uncomfortable that you guys have sexual urges. You guys are out creeps, not me. I'm different. That's why I have to every guy in there get out of, I like these guys fucking the other guys in there, but that's so annoying. When they tried to talk to, I went to there. There's one here, there's one in west Hollywood that's like a sex store and the guy was like being really friendly and he's like, Hey, what's up? What's going on? It's like, you know what's going on dude? It's, this isn't target. I'm not maybe here for a vacuum or greeting cards. Yeah, we're not a fly tying. Oh Shit.

Speaker 3:          01:01:13       I'm here for Weird Porno Shit. Just let me get the thing and stop making me feel weird and tackle. You're going to tell me about the best spots right now. These barbers are pretty good man, but those dildos will do the trick and tell you what, if you're just willing to take the drive, Sacramento La fucking salmon fishing is off the chain anyway. Amount 42 bucks for this angel bead. Here you go do to date and tackle and anal beads that tackle and they end up fishing and fucking fish place. It'd be called like a fish. You're like the fuck to I opened up this shop, dude, it's called fishing and fucking Ooh, tell he almost totally, totally work. But the problem is nobody buys things from a store anymore. You can just go order a Amazon fucking Dildo online. You get it shipped to your house and one day Amazon prime prime. Same Day. If you get an early enough, this is a real legitimate question. I'm not playing stupid. Does Amazon sell masturbating and tackle our competition? These guys just beat around the bush. We're fishing and fishing and fucking, they masturbate all you want. I brought a fuck rather fuck. You don't know what the fuck you're talking about

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       over here. You're gonna fuck your own hand. I'm going to have somebody else. Fuck it. Does Amazon Sell Rubber Dicks? Ghada Ghada Jamie, how many of you ordered from them? Don't lie. And he's like, yes, of course. Worked for a company that did that, so I'm sure they'd sell them on Amazon. That's sold rubber dicks. Yeah. You know who sometimes sends me Rubber Dick's for and I asked a fleshlight those people at flashlight and in Austin when I was doing moontower years ago, I'd be friended a few of the people there and they were like, we'll send you some stuff. So they sent me like a few of the flashlights, but they also sent me bags at Dick's bags. A Dick's rubber ducks on them. You Go, you could buy a bunch of rubber Dick's, you can get off. Did they have rubber vaginas or are they discriminatory and anti male in their practices?

Speaker 1:          01:02:58       Come on, you fucks. I don't see a single rubber vagina sexist bullshit course because that would be objectifying spank. Spank Bank. What does that, it's just an actual bank. Just poorly named frank fleshlight daylight parody. Oh, it's a show. It's a, it's like a book. It looks like a book. What did you type in, Jamie? It's Al. It's a song and type in men sex toy. Do men sex toy. See if that does it. Fleshlight was our original sponsor, the first sponsor of this podcast with a flashlight. Just pills, nothing. Jen, Samer, Dick's all day long. It's a rubber Dick. Is that a rubber Dick to put your Dick Inside? That's the extender. You put your tickets out of another dick. Penis extender. It says delay, ejaculate. Wait, there you go. We'll simulator the aircraft cup, but look how they say it. Male simulate young girls, nails, toys, adult products. They got every tag.

Speaker 1:          01:03:48       Scroll back up to that Dick one. Look at this. Look what it says. It says delay. Ejaculations. Yeah, like forever. Like you'll never come. You're not having sex. Do you want to stop coming? Like put this on. It's a big clear fake Dick that goes over your Dick had this guy, Steve, come kick you in the cock. You won't come for hours. That's up fucking rough road for a dude to the tiny deck. If you have a micro Dick, there is not a god damn the micro penis saying there's nothing they can do. How real is that though? It's real. Is it real? Hundred percent you're so funny. How real is that? Well, how many people have micro penises for real? It's a real issue. Guys have like one inch dicks. I think it's a real issue. An inch when it's filled with blood rock hard, that's an inch rock hard.

Speaker 1:          01:04:30       You got this. That's their penis. The whole Dick. Not even my full failure throw thinkers because it's too big because a lot of guys are seeing this right now and going like duke is that big said girls don't care about so it was bro. It's not. That's not, that's not what matters. That's what they say to guys with little ducks. They go, it's fine. I love it. I like it. I don't care. Really. So you're saying this is a man that half of that, that's a man's penis. Girls have no problem mocking it. They would just mock it. The market in front of her friends in front of you, like guys, a little dicks. It says high. It was all I all, I couldn't fucking debt. I scan because you can't retire. You can't be like can you push these big? But if a guy did talk like that, he would be a monster.

Speaker 1:          01:05:07       Like a guy was talking about a giant poster. Yo Dude, I had a breakup with her. My balls would fall in. I'd be fucking, I'd be strapping a two by four to my ass. No. See I was lacking from getting sucked into the boy. Four questions about the life of the micro penis reveals about the folding 0.6% of the population to see. It's enough. That's enough. That's dude. That's if you have a hundred people that means what? How many people is that less than one? Not even one. No wait 6.6 so 200 people. You have one two to 1.2 yeah. Right. That's a lot. 200 people. So if you at the comedy store six out of a thousand that's right. If you're the comedy store, just two people in the room on a full house on Saturday night that I have, my one guy has a micro tech, well you gotta think it's 50 50 men women. So one guy in that room was a micro Dick. So if you make a joke about a micro Dick, one guy's like, okay,

Speaker 5:          01:05:53       no,

Speaker 1:          01:05:55       the joke before, he loves so much, he's still laughing, but in his head he's like, no, don't you agree when you're shitting on giant pussies, this guy's the best. I love the major pussy joke. They're too big because these are just too big and they are too big. It doesn't get in the way. Perfect. If want to have to urinate, it's there from me. But that's crazy to think if a girl dates a guy with a micro penis and she just sticks around because she was like, well, he's a good dude. Well, um, I know a lady who had a few children, she had three children with a microphone, decided no with a regular peanuts guy. He's a handsome fellow. I'm sure it was quite a sturdy cock. Paul, like an ax handle hefty. He looks like he's of Viking. Um, but anyway, uh, those kids had a blown a hole through the old car port and so she decided to get everything all stitched up. She said it was the most painful thing that she'd ever done. Totally more painful than childbirth because they go in there and cut. I'll say that again.

Speaker 1:          01:06:55       They cut and then they stitch that bitch up to like a finger gets broken when you put it in there. It's like tighter than anal and I'm unbelievably painful and I can't even strap yourself in. Num Num num goes numb because like you ever have surgery when they cut all those nerves, a lot of times that nerve damage. Yeah. Like my knee, I had a acl reconstruction on one of my knees with what's called a Patella tendon graft. They open you up, they'd take a big, like foreign slice. They open you up and they take a piece of your patella tendon, screw all these things and stitch it back up. That whole area. I had that thing done in like, fuck 1994 it's still numb. Like my knees numb. None of the nerves have repaired. No, not over where the, uh, the incision is. It's taught like I'm touching it right now.

Speaker 1:          01:07:45       I literally, it feels like someone stuck novacane in it. I can touch to the left. I feel it. I touch to the right. I feel it. I touched right with that.

Speaker 1:          01:08:26       Well, I just would assume that they would have figured out a way to fix dicks. I think they think that's funny. I think they're just like, fuck them. I don't think there's anything they can do. Does it all the way around. Crispr crispr is going to come around and that's going to fucking, you know what crispr is as Jeanette, this is new tool that they have to a altered genes and altered dna where you can like pick baby shit. You gonna be able to pick baby shift for sure. That's wild. That's 100% they're probably already doing it in China. Sort of six to 18 years from now, the Olympic Games, we're going to see some just genetic freaks from going to be amazing. I can't wait. We're going to be like, wait, what the fuck is that person? 14 year olds for the air breaking records. Fucking quadruple somil over people or they're playing basketball, Adh, vertical leaps and shit.

Speaker 1:          01:09:11       They're gonna like jump from the free throw line and the other side of the court and do flip through the air and slam dunk and everyone's going to go, wait, what? No, everyone's going to go off ma. Yeah, seen it. At that point we'll be just a normal fucking thing. Did you see that video that I sent it to you Jamie? That dog that jumps through the air and you can't, you literally can't believe how high the dog jumps. Did I say I'm going to send it, I'll send it to you right now, but is this I sent it to, I know I sent it to Cowen cause he's a sharp are both dog freaks but it doesn't even make any sense. Like you, you look at the video and you go like, what the fuck this one? Nope. That's not it. But let me see this dog. Let me see that one.

Speaker 1:          01:09:49       We are the body on the other thing. Little Stud jacked here. He goes, boy. Oh, he's running up the wall and I've seen this crazy. This stuff is insane. It's crazy. That dog just jumped. It looks like he jumped 18 feet in the air. He did it least right? Yeah. That looks like 18 feet and he bites the rope and so that it pulls them down slowly so he doesn't get hurt. That's amazing. The guy helps it. Guy Catches him to do. That's a fucking crazy dog. Pit Bull can leap four meter walls. What? Four meters? They're not regular dogs, man. Look at us. See Fecha Veggie at Holy Shit. That is incredible. Find this fucking dog. Oh, also I wanted to ask you about this. Have you seen mass wrestling? Do you know what that is? Mass wrestling. Do you know what it is that type that in? This is nuts. Mass wrestling. Before I forget it, I wanted to tell you about it. People like there's like a, there's like a bar. Look at this. What are they doing? They, there's like a bar. Do they both have to grip onto and they're pulling it or the coaching you get legs. How many people die doing this? Ah, isn't this fucking insane?

Speaker 1:          01:11:00       Do a lot of weight. Ton. I mean, Dude, look at these two dudes. It's all that's all grip and leg strength and shit.

Speaker 4:          01:11:07       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:11:08       it's wild as shit. I got watched like 50 videos of it. I got so soaked into it. I was like, how? Why? Why are people doing this?

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       It's like tug of war with like a statement with something stable. You know, I'm sending it to you right now, Jamie. You got to see this. Uh, it looks like we'll do these guys. Are they blurring out that guy's hog? I would like that it was a hog butt ass naked. I mean, I originally got in the right light. There's a little pixelation. I originally got into this because I was jerking off to it. That's why I wanted to see this stick. I thought they had their hand. So they're holding on holding on this like this. This, yeah, like the guy on the left is winning, but he's all arms. Look at his little bitch ass legs. I got my money on the guy on the right. I don't like the way the guy on the right or the left rather has overdeveloped his arms and underdeveloped his legs.

Speaker 2:          01:11:47       That guy's going to quit. They got in the left. Yeah, he's got no legs down. That's going to give out. The guy on the right is Russian. It looks like he's from a hut in the middle of Siberia. He, his whole family lives in a yurt. You have to kill him. The left did not run. Look at his legs like he'll get his calves. That guy's not, he's not fit. See, told you. That's why I'm a good mma commentator called it. I know when I see it, dude, it's just like he's jacked. You look at his upper body and his forearms and shit and his biceps and his shoulders. I'm like, the guys jacked. There's no leg strength there, but he's got zero in his legs, which means his mind is weak. That's what it means. His mind his week. He wants everybody to think he's strong, but he's not doing the real hard work.

Speaker 2:          01:12:31       Nobody gives a fuck. If you're doing squats, you don't, nobody notices. Okay. If you do push ups and you do bench press and you're fucking tits pop out, everybody sees it, watch this dog. You ain't gonna Shit. You ain't even going to believe this. This doesn't even seem real. Look at this dog flies. I think that's a Belgian malinois flies whole just flies. And then they have them land on a cushion, which is pretty sweet. Look when he jumps off that guy's shoulder, the guy shoulders. But that's gotta be 23 lead jumps. I mean it's at least 15. He's at least 15 feet in the air. What's even cooler is a dog that he's flying. Um, the, uh, it's send it official on instagram one all one word, send it official. That's a one of them instagram page that has a bunch of crazy shit on it.

Speaker 2:          01:13:15       It's always, there's a lot of those that are pretty good. I follow. A lot of them will do the original, like the send it quote, you know, that's from, you've seen those guys that, have you seen those guys? He's like, come on Marty. Stand at and he just like jumped shocks and fucking just do that makes me laugh so hard. Every time he's like, what'd you go do? He's like, I'm a fucking sand it truck. It just shoots it off a shitty fucking ramp. Hold my beer while I send the fucking sand it. Have you seen hold this beer on twitter? If you ever seen that? I call my beer. Yeah. I think it's hold this hold. This is the actual twitter account, but it says hold my beer is the name of it. Oh right, right, right, right. That one is, that's an hold. My beer can't go wrong with that one. No, that stuff's hilarious. If you can deal with it, if you can deal with it, cause sometimes you're going to watch people that are to get absolute brain damage, but I love it whenever it's not me. There's one where a dude is standing on a hill and a bale of hay is coming towards him and his bail hay. It looks like it might waste six 700 pounds. Right. And it's huge. He's taken, jumps up into the

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       air like he's trying to get over it and he does it make it and he goes fucking flying and he got hit by a bus. I love that shit. I mean the dude goes, if you ever seen a bay, one of those big ass. Yeah, circle. Bill's a hail it bigger than this table. Huge. Those are so fucking bigger than a truck tire. They're so heavy and this dumb fuck thought he was going to jump over it. My favorite is grossly overestimate how well there it is. Come on dude. My sister again, I mean the fact that he's alive, fucked up. He is lucky he's not paralyzed. Look at this. Boom. I mean he did a full flip through the air. That fucking thing is so heavy. You just no way you would pick that up. You know my favorite is the medicine balls. When people bump the, you know, and they would be able to do medicine ball challenge where they run at each other.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       If you ever seen that, they'll tow both grab a medicine ball, run shot at full speed and jumping and whoever gets hit the furthest, but sometimes people do with their kids. Oh Chin. Like a Dan will be just fucking around. You see a kid go flying 30 feet in the room. Jesus Christ. Oh that's my favorite shit. I love there's a, there was one on there that's like fail army or fail blog or something and they showed the same kind of fucking stuff where people would just have this crazy idea of what they would do to get away from things that other people aren't doing. It totally charged fucking sidestep. I'd decide stuff. Um, that was, that's always jump over it. That's always been an inside joke in a mma forums about sidestepping that uh, if someone who's coming after me, I just fucking side sides, I'll admit, I just sidestep.

Speaker 1:          01:15:38       Most people just don't know what to do. They stand there and freeze. I just charged up get all the way, like I got it planned out. People are going to swarm you, swarm you like a Zombie bite your face. Like wait, which side? Snapping them. Dude. Sidestep. Sidestep a mall. But people think they could do or if they're forking bowl was coming after me or just step aside matadors or faggots with total fucking punch. I'll use your, uh, we'll use your fake martial arts videos. Those guys. Those are my fucking dude. Those are my favorite. I resist putting those videos up cause there's so many of them get sent to me. It, I can't keep putting him up. The guy that like a wind technique like with his breath is because the other guy, great page on instagram. Make Dojo. Is it Mick Dojo or mcdo Joe Life.

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       I forget which one it is. We told you a life. We mic Dojo. Mic Dojo. They call them macdill like a Dojo is a martial arts school. Nick Doe Joe's like a mall martial arts school. That's what we would call like cheesy, shitty martial arts schools. Mick Dojo, watch this guy. Watch this guy go go full screen on this one. And he just wants to fucking preposterous. The guy comes out and with a sword and he uses his power and the guy goes flying. I buy, I buy every second of it. Old Japanese guy. I buy this goofy white guys who would have been the guys in boyle heights. They were saying, we're here for your community. We love that. They would be the same guy. He's old, Dorky liberal guys who probably call themselves feminists and they just flying through the air with her. Kido suits aren't, he is fucking this guy up. He's fit fucking this dude.

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       He leads him around and then sit down to the ground. Well, you know as a feminism, more likely to get tossed around. It's almost looks like a coordinated dance. It's so silly. They're also silly. What does that one next to it? The guy with the karate outfit. What is he going to do? Is that a girl or guy to guy? Oh, oh my God. He's doing flips on his head, breaking the boards and then flipping onto his feet. So he's crushing or the blocks of stone with his head. Yup. What does it sound like?

Speaker 6:          01:17:45       Oh my God, he's doing it like, like flipping one more.

Speaker 2:          01:17:53       Yea He did it. If that ever comes up, do you need to flip and land on someone's Dick that guys at taekwondo outfit on? That doesn't make any sense to me. That's so weird. What could those be made out of the shittiest rock known demand? Like if you pissed on it, we'll probably break. It can't be rock. Yeah, it's, it's some sort of shitty ass bitch ass concrete pit yet. Did you get that bag of bitch ass concrete? We ordered. Yeah man you got some bitch ass. Fuck people up breaking shit with my head. But there's a lot of people out there that buy into that stupid stuff man. But my point about it is like there's a lot of people that buy in anything. That's why people join cults. That was why people, they fall into these ideas and they believe him wholeheartedly and then you know are new religious like the all the new cool religions where like the dude's are like, remember, I think I talked to you about it where like there's these new motivational speak speak churches where it's like that's all it is.

Speaker 2:          01:18:55       Yeah. I read about one recently that uses a friend of mine synagogue from where a friend of mine goes for his service. He's Jewish where he, him and his family go. These people rent it out like on some days and they'd come down, they have this rock and roll sort of rock and roll church, but the guys like this charismatic Sorta Halfass Waco Dude and they're all good looking like Koresh type shit. It's like five or six of these guys with varying degrees of bullshit a tube and they're all, they're all rich. They're all tall, super, super rich. Tons of money, man. Well, especially if they can get like young, really wealthy people who are not long good looking kids. My friend went to one, he was saying, he was like, dude, you have to see that. He's like, the women that were there were, every one of them was gorgeous. Yeah. My buddy had a personal assistant, he was a producer of a TV show and he had a personal assistant and his personal assistant was, she was nice, but she was off like she was just, it was, there was some wires, it would just, you know, [inaudible] they just weren't connecting. Right. And she started going to this church. He's like, you would love it because it's not like a regular church. Like we just sang the whole things. We talk about thing. They give us a haircut.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       Your life like, okay, do you have to give him money? Like how's that work? Tons of money. Let's talk. And then you give me money. I don't have any services. I give, I'm not really big on services. The law get together and talk and then I get paid. And then how like mansions, I like to live in a magic. So we'll we're gonna do is I'm going to regurgitate some anthony robins quotes and I'm going to tell you about life it and then a little bit of Jesus. I'm gonna throw some Jesus in there to seem legit little sprinkle of Jesus. We love Jesus. We're not heavy. Jesus. You know, we're, we're like Paleo. Ask Paleo Church, Paleo. But we also like spaghetti. It's like, it's okay, I'll snack on it. Snuck on Spaghetti. Jesus teens. I'm going to, I'm not gonna lie, I'm not going to, I can't say no.

Speaker 3:          01:20:48       I'm not willing to give up my salting. Nope. You know, I would go paleo if it wasn't for crackers. I like Ritz. I like to put on the bits every now and then I want to put on the wrist. This is what I like putting on the Ritz. Give me money. Yeah, man, there's a lot of loss people out there. Uh, and then there's people that come along and then the capitalize on it, on those lost people and then they figure out like, oh, there's a market and capitalizing on loss people and they ramp that shit up. Total hopper. You know who I find is the big who like makes now that now that like, because I'm like buying all sorts of stuff for this puppy. The Co, the stuff I should have gotten into was like tricking people into needing pet stuff. Like if I got to vent a pet thing, like what thing would you invent?

Speaker 3:          01:21:25       Invent one right now we can just see no started out in the front of fucking it. Just put it out. You've got your and your dog toys right? When you get to that register, I'll tell you what, that's when you're most susceptible to impulse buy. That's where we put dollars jet blue. So puppy toy or some shit. Puppy Dildo. Be Great. If the store was empty and all you had was stuck by the register cause you're like they don't buy out there man. They buy right here. That's all we did. And fucking fishing. Ride the register. It's a robot fuck doll for your dog. I thought about it. I been thinking about this for 25 years. It's a robot phone that I've got these Japanese scientists involved and we figured out the perfect height. You don't really need all can fuck it. Don't snip your dog man. Don't, don't fucking don't neutered or spayed or nothing. Just tell you what your robot photo misconception is that a big dog can't fuck a little robot dog. Cause again, watch, he'll get low. So this is like, you don't really need the one that you can't sell after your dog dies.

Speaker 3:          01:22:21       And then I came in, you got a dog dude. You know, ever since Ross, he died, his robot fuck dogs just been sitting in the garage had been hoping it's, it's sad. Someone could come on and come in it, it'd be bop one more humans and just to, just for their youth. That is an issue when your dog tries to Hump your kids like problem. Yeah. My uh, my massive has a, has humped people before you got to let one kid go, you gotta go. Yeah. You've got to sacrifice the one you liked the least. You know what I mean? Anything disturbing about 140 pound dog named Johnny Cash and wants a hump your leg, you know, he's a sweet dog. But if he wasn't, if you wasn't to be a real issue problem, your real problem. Yeah. What do you say?

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       Hey, hey, cut the shit and they look at you and go [inaudible] hold in front of you do it all the time. This is what feels good to me. It feels good to me and I'm doing it. Did you ever have moments where you were when your dogs have ever seen you like jerking off or having sex or anything like that? No. Jury got in front of my dogs. Never. Or have sex in front of him. No, I did. I do it first day just to let them know. I've heard about people that are having, I'm going to do it all comes in and starts licking their feet. I've heard that kind of shit. Yeah. Heard that shit and then they come harder and the girl was like, why don't you come so quick? I was look at my feet. What? They'll probably bomber out. We're trying to uplift my balls and I came like a wildcat.

Speaker 1:          01:23:44       Wow. Heads. They just get a bunch of dogs around and lick your feet. Sure. People are doing that. I mean that has been always been the old thing about peanut butter, peanut butter, peanut butter, peanut peanut butter on your pussy and dogs, peanut butter, your ball sack dogs looking up the peanut butter. I mean like come on, you have to be so fucking, you have to be so out of options to make your dog lick your ass, lick your nuts and your asshole. Just go hire a human hiring human. It's a lot of people that are really desperate, you know, like you think about it, the human touch like touch from person is mandatory like people need it is a requirement like vitamin C and it's just a requirement that your body needs. But there's a lot of people that just don't get it. I know, I never knew how were, how much of a requirement was until when I first moved to La. When I first moved to La, uh, I moved from La, from New York to La. Didn't know anyone out here didn't have any friends.

Speaker 1:          01:24:35       And I was on this set and uh, I'm doing this TV show and I was there for like a couple of weeks and I guess I hadn't hugged anybody or done, touched anybody in a couple of weeks. And this girl and set gave me a hug, just gave me a hug and it was like, oh. It was like I got filled up with like affection and love. Ah, that's just real. But it was, it was the weirdest, like I had never experienced that before because, you know, I always had a girlfriend or always had friends that it was always some sort of physical contact. Right. But out here you were alone. I was alone. And then when this girl hugged me, I was like, and I remember never forgetting and I'm like, wow, that was a weird moment. Like that's a, that's a physical requirement. Like when that girl hugged me, my body was like, yes, this is what we need.

Speaker 1:          01:25:18       It like, Whoa, like when you're thirsty and you get a glass of water, you're like, ah. That's what it was like when she hugged me and it wasn't even the sexual thing. It was just a human affection. Yeah. Well that's why. That's why they say kids that don't get touched when they're young get like that. Don't get hugged or any affection that grew up so fucked up mentally. It the part of your brain doesn't develop that, that, that meeting, that chemical react cause the transfer of chemicals skin to skin. That's like such a big deal for the development of your brain. So when kids don't get it, it fucking ruins then. Yeah. They say that about babies and orphanages. The babies in orphanages, they don't get, they don't get it. They die. They can literally die from not being held. That's a trip. Meanwhile, animals just fucking put their kids out in like, go get the fuck outta here.

Speaker 1:          01:25:58       Get the kick them out of their nest. The the fuck face learning to fly. He ever seen those birds that fall off cliffs who showed us that was at sturgeon now I think I did. I think it was last time I was here. I think it was you. Yeah. The birds that fall just to see if they can stay alive. The rocks and half of them die. Before I came on, I saw that class. Right. That was fucked up. This is a lot of like dark shit in the, in the animal community. You think about the survival of these little beasts. Absurd. I was just reading about how many deer every year freeze to death in Idaho. Don't ask me why, but that was, I was reading, it's thousands. It's like sometimes these, they'd lose thousands of animals. Even tried to migrate somewhere else that you may have made up.

Speaker 1:          01:26:38       Those numbers might be hundreds. It's like six. It's a lot. That's a lot. They call it winter kill and when they have a hard winter, like a real hard winter and it was hundreds and hundreds animals this dead frozen to death. Like imagine living in a place where you barely make it. Like cryogenics right? When you go to crowd healthcare in, your legs are shaking and you get out of there at three minutes and 40 seconds to someone stays in there to six and they just become an ice cube. That's fucking insane. That's what you live. You don't have a house, your stupid fucking deer wandering around through the woods. That's it. That's your life to get eaten. That's like back in, back in the Midwest. Uh, they would send out those flyers all the time for a registered gun owners to go hunt. Cause the overpopulation of the deer, it was so bad that they would die or that they would try to eat each other, which is crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:27:19       It's turning the cannibals. But yeah, cause there wasn't a food, you know, so there was overpopulation. It wasn't a food down enough landmass. They would try to eat each other. Christ. I'd never heard of that. But they'd get, they'd get a, they'd pay, they would, you know, they would give you incentive to go to go hunt if you were, you know, a hunter to go take care of some of the deer. Well there's two options. Either you hunt them or you bring in something else. That anthem, that second option is always a bigger problem. Way bigger problem. Then you change the change, the whole makeup of it. Yeah. Well, California is kind of done that. California has done a weird thing because every other state manages their Predator population. California, you can bear hunt in California, but you can't do it in any effective way.

Speaker 1:          01:28:00       What that means is like there's two ways that are really effective ways to hunt bears. One is over bait, so you would like leave some food down and you'd wait in like a blind and hide in the bear would come to get the food because otherwise the places where bears live, they don't live in a open country. They hide and they smell everything. They smell you miles away, like literally miles away. If the wind is at your back and the wind blows across a valley in a is two miles away, he'll go like, he'll know you there. And that's not even a joke. I mean it's a different kind of thing. And then on top of that, the here way better than you can imagine. And they see pretty good too. So you're fucked. Like you're not going to find right. So they have a bear, they'd have bear hunting and California, but it's very ineffective. Like most people don't, don't, you can't put bait, I mean it was just had to be circumstance that you found. Yeah. The only other place is where, um, you can hunt bears effectively and it's not over bait are areas where there's like wide open spaces or um, these cut blocks would, a cut block is where a lumber

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       company comes in and chops down trees and then these little roots grow up and he's little tiny saplings and stuff. And the bears like to come in and eat those. And meadows like peep. So people go to meadows and occasionally you'll spot a bear there, but the does its Predator control. And then the other thing is I'm with dogs. The dog one is very problematic because people don't like that. Look, the idea of dogs bang up a bear, a tree and then you shoot it out of a tree. It just seems really fucked up. Right. That makes sense to me. Um, the mount line one is another one. Like they stopped all mountain lion hunting in this state and I just decided, no, no, not going extinct. Now, this is a lot of mountain lions. Why they, why they want to get rid of it?

Speaker 2:          01:29:42       It's a political thing. Same thing is a, there's a grizzly bear ban in British Columbia that you can't hunt grizzly bears in British Columbia, but they have a lot of grizzly bears. It's like it's a real problem, but it was, there was a ban that was put together by animal rights activists and then signed by, it was really just a few thousand people that took like an email poll and then they pass this 75% of them and now now they're going to have a real problem with grizzly bears because the people that passed this, they all live in Vancouver. Vancouver is beautiful. It's, it's a city metro area. There's no grizzly bears, but those other people that live like north, you go like four hours past Vancouver and these people live in the forest. They have giant 10 foot monsters that eat cows that live in their fucking woods. And you just said, you just made it illegal to shoot the monsters.

Speaker 2:          01:30:29       Right. And you don't even live around the monsters. You don't even know what the fuck you're doing. You're in a high rise. Also, where those people live, you can shoot as many wolves as you want, so it's gotten so bad up there with wolves. You could shoot a hundred wolves a day and every day we need, the more they want you to give you money for it, and some cases get up and shoot Wolfe's. Holy Shit. Let's go shoot some fucking Wolfe's. Dude. I don't want to be around wolves that need to be shot. I want to be, or I want to be around wolves where there's a healthy population where I don't have to do anything. Right. The last thing you want to do is be around wolves where there's so many wolves, they have to shoot him. That's when shit gets sketch. Yeah. That's when it gets, when they come after you, that's, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:31:06       That's when there's a fucked up. There's a balance. There's an issue and that that's what happens if everybody's like, well, leave. Landon was Lou and they control their own population. Yes, you're correct, but it'll take 30 years. Are you willing to see this overpopulation of grizzly pairs attacking wildlife, attacking people, attacking dogs, and breaking into people's houses because that will happen. And will we include coaching in their land? Sort of. But guess what? If they find out where our food is there going to encroach into land tissue like there's no do we have no land and just give up. Give up your house, man. You know, what is this like? What are you doing when people don't have a realistic idea of what animal life is like? Animal Life is beautiful, but it's also life with its own ideas about survival and what he wants to do. And if you don't manage the predators, you're not going to have the other animals. You're not going to have the deer. You're not going to have the moves. Totally. You've got to manage everything and biologists know how to do it. But then we get

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       involved. Like, man, I just do want to see the barest dime man. People were talking about bringing bears back to California. It's crazy. Fucking shipping him. Embarrass. Yes, ship. Amen. Well, we have a grizzly bear on our state. Flag. Yeah, no, but the last grizzly bear was shot and killed in Lubbock, California. There's a city, well, I don't know if it was kids that like back up north. Yeah, like near Bakersfield on the way to Bakersfield and it was a, I think the dude's name was steven the back. See if you could find a l. E, b, e c I believe he was the last man in California to be killed by a grizzly bear and they want it. That's a wrap there. Peter. Lubeck, Peter Lubbock and killed by aspects bear. What is that? What it says x bear? I think a x bear by x bear.

Speaker 1:          01:32:46       I think that's like a space that's like a cross like well site because it's not totally an ex. October 17th, 1837 wow. October 17th, 1837 and that's when they just went hog and just killed all the bears. They had a huge bears in California too. They were like coastal brown bears, like the kind they have in Alaska. Those enormous ones you see like they look like buses. That's what they had here. What are the, what was it Kodiak? Kodiak, Kodiak? Yeah. That's a weird place. What does this, the Mr Peter Lubbock and the x bear. Oh, so it was the did call it the x bear. I wonder why they call it the x bear. Okay. So it was a out in Lubbock, cause it's now it says it's now fort to hone where's the four off of the, uh, off of the five. It was at the time it says just the wiles of the tach p mountains, which by the way is the exact same area from their worldly blood.

Speaker 1:          01:33:41       Where a Daniel Day Lewis, that movie there will be blood. Yeah. That's the, that's where they scored oil. That's right. It's out in that area. Is that him right there? That's his homeboy homeboy that got jacked. No, that's, that's, that's to turn it Robert Williams. And what does Williamson leading a government expedition and pass through Santa Clarita in 1853 as a part of an effort to find a practical route for a transcontinental railroad. And then, and then they found bears 1853 he noted an unusually large number of grizzly bears in the area. There's a lot of pair share. Oh boy. Okay. Well hold on. Sub Sub. Sub Sub. Sub. Scroll down. It says party left by Fitzgerald beal, Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald, Bill Commissioner, the Indian affairs at the time found the Lubeck tree a tree in 1854 okay, so it's a tree where the, they like had something that they left to market. This is by 1890 the tree bark had grown over and cover the Lubeck inscription. Yeah, so there was a, there was a tree that was wine that like had written on it. This is the where the body was remained the remains of a man approximately six feet tall who was missing his right forearm, both feet and his left hand along with two broken ribs and left side. All consistent with a gruesome bear attack. Yeah, baby [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          01:34:57       So that's what they did when they had these bears in California. They were just jacking people. So they killed them all. Like they literally have no bears left. Not just in California, but there's brown bears. But no, no grizzly bears. Brown bears are much smaller. Bare. There's not only are they not in California, like I don't even think they're close to California kid hair along its back and shoulders appeared to form an ex. Uh, it's a common exper what, where's, where's all the grizzlies and the candor all north? Yeah. You got to go to like, I think if I'm correct, I don't think you can find them until you get to like British Columbia. I don't think they're even in Washington state. I think they have them in Idaho. They have them in Wyoming. They're starting to find them in Colorado. In fact, my friend Adam Green tree, the guy was shot that bull up there, that giant buffalo water buffalo and the top of the flag, that dude for spotted and filmed them in, I think the San Juan Mountains.

Speaker 1:          01:35:55       I think that's where it is. I think that's the name of the range in Colorado where people are saying there's no grizzly bears. But he found one hit a video of it. He's like, that is all fucking grizzly bear because he's from Australia. Fuck King. That's how he talks. Which state has the most grizzly bears? Um, 600 more live of 1500 left in the lower 48 states that you have about 800 live in Montana. She say they gotta be up there 600 more live in Wyoming. He had left and there's an estimated 70 a hundred living in northern and eastern Idaho. Okay. So I was right. And two of them in Texas for some reason, but they're in a, they're in Colorado now. Adam is right a guarantees, right? Because first of all, Colorado borders Wyoming and it borders a lot of what that area is like.

Speaker 1:          01:36:39       What, what, what's on the edges of Colorado. I know Wyoming's on one side, I guarantee you they've crossed in because, well, Utah Biologists or they're questioning this, the validity of this. But Adam has been around bears. Not only is he been around bears, he's filmed himself getting charged with bears while he's holding up a pistol and put it on instagram. He was on a 28 day back country hunt in a, so what do we got here? Colorado. What's off to the left as Utah, Utah, one side, there's no bearing on the top. Yeah. So they come down from the top man. Guarantee you. Yeah, Fort Collins is right there. I guarantee you there's some grizzly bears there. Adam knows. The point is, this is not like a like me, if I went into the woods and other dude is, oh grizzly bear, don't listen to me.

Speaker 1:          01:37:19       I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. He, he knows, he knows. He's sure he can see one. You know a mile away. Look at it through a spotting scope and say, that is a grizzly bear, right where I can't. I go, it's a fucking bear. It's big ass to pick. There might be a big brown bear, but he was positive. It was a grizzly bear. He said about big fucking Grizzly, Ken Baisley. But people have other people spotted them too. And people have called bullshit on him, but there he is right there. This is him. Hold up the pistol and you see bite by that tree to the left of that train. The fog in the distance. That's a fucking bear. Standing at a time. Legs. Watch this. See it. See it standing in the fuck you. Indeed.

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       The thing rushed him three or four times. Now here's where it gets crazy. He had a gun but the gun had the wrong size bullets and he didn't even know it, but it was jammed. So even though he thinks that he would be able to shoot that bear, he really wouldn't be able to because the bullet isn't even in the fucking chamber. Look at that 300, 4,000 views. I think that was in uh, believe that was an Idaho. No. Youdo you think that was an, I know that's where he was. And then here's the other big thing. You shoot that fucking thing and you know you're in real big trouble. You have to prove that that thing was trying to kill you. If you had video, that's fucking amazing. Yeah, he did this. One of the reasons why I filmed it, to let it, cause he had been charged, bluff charged a few times.

Speaker 2:          01:38:41       I'd run up to within stop. It's always a woman with her babies. Like she's just trying to, and a woman, female bear with their babies. She's trying to protect these bitches. Are Bears fucking charging me and said, mama trying to protect her cubs. I get it that the dudes don't do that. They won't charge now. They just hate you. They'll fuck you up. Yeah. If a dude is charging you, you're fucked. Really hungry. Just want you to go with that. Most of the time the males are just run away in the less and less, um, you kill something and then it decides to take it from you. Like if you kill a deer and it's wants it, yep. You better let it fucking have it. You have to fuck off. Well, in certain places you have to like, you're not even allowed to scare them off, I think.

Speaker 2:          01:39:23       I mean, I would let them dates. There's some states it might be Montana. No, there's some, it might be Wyoming, Wyoming. Maybe there's one state where once you shoot something, if it might be Idaho, it's one of those states we just keep jumping and keep jumping. They could be North Dakota. If a bear finds your your meat, you have to leave it alone. You have to leave the bear with your meat. You have to give up. I mean, well, who? Who's fighting that? Yeah. I would let that shit go. Most dudes, I bet at that bit they'll shoot that thing, shoot the bear. Just because how hard it is to, if you're on a back country hunt and you, you finally get a deer. You know how hard that is to do. It's so hard. It's going to be like circle of life type of shit where you're like, man, I fucking, I'm in.

Speaker 2:          01:40:06       You know what I mean? Boom. You're in their restaurant. Boom. Fuck you. Yeah. It's Meegan Sam. Fuck you in the Dick. I just wouldn't go to a place they wouldn't let you scare off a prison. I don't want to go to a place that has them. See, that's my shit. I'm not. No, thanks. Yeah. I only bird on him when I was a kid burden directly. I did dear, but a bird hunted a lot when I was a kid. My Dad loved bird hunting. The thing about deer, and I mean even bird hunting, it's like if you're in the right place, you could run into a wolf or a bear. You could if you kill a bear in defensive license, life and property, barris killed in defensive life and property belonged to the state. If you kill a bear, you must remove the hide from the carcass and also salvage the skull. By the way, that happened to my friend Cam Haynes. He, this is a crazy bears are bro. He shot a bear with a bow

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       and Arrow killed it and then another bear claimed the body and start a burring it, this female bear. Holy Shit just decided as mine, I'm gonna eat this. And because they cannibalize each other, totally. Hundred percent of the time, 100% of all bears are cannibals. They just all kind of one bears dead. The other ones to start eating it, babies, they start eating it. This is how fucked up it is. My Buddy lives in Alberta and uh, his son watched a bear kill a cub and then watched the mom eat the baby. Oh fuck. That's crazy. Like the mom chased the, the bear off that killed the cub and then she ate it. Yeah. Well cause it's dead at that point. Was she going to do? But it's just what patrician yeah. That is what it is. I mean, that's literally how they, I mean, that's, that's how they roll up there.

Speaker 1:          01:41:37       You've never looked at your kid and been like, I ain't even fucking eat my kid. Look good part. What part would you eat first? Uh, for the fat, whatever the fattiest is. You know what I mean? Just pop the legs off. I mean, when you're down to that point, like if you're in like one of them, uh, situations like the, like, like a, like a movie life crap. Yeah. They crashing and he's alive. Like when you start eating, people do, do you look for the place where you jump off first? Like once you get to the point where you're like, [inaudible] get about eating each other. I'm killing myself. Yeah. I'll probably jumping off a cliff jumping. I'm not he unwanted. You fucking people, man. People who would walk up, bro. But there's some places where you're just not walking out. Okay. You better get that out of your head because you don't have any food.

Speaker 1:          01:42:18       Yeah. There's no water. There's nothing. Nope. You're not going to make it get it's a lot at the real guys. Wow. That's crazy. It was soccer team, right? Yeah, and so they ate dudes who died. Is this when they rescued him? They took pictures of him. That what it is that has them going back to the scene. They look very happy. They look happy. It must, they must have been rescued. That's crazy shit. Is that the movie? That's the movie as the bull show is. What's the real image? I asked the real image. Wow. That's fucked man. Chill. Imagine how long did they live up there for? 72 days says, oh Jesus, that's a long time to be people. You know. You get old too. You'd be like this guys. Fingers don't taste good and they're eating everything frozen too. I don't even know if they could make fires. They're scooping like the using a spoon to scoop your asshole out.

Speaker 1:          01:43:09       What did they, they use your bottle as a fucking bowl. They're just putting stuff in your bottle as a bolt. They figured out fire like how to make a fire up there or what would they do? I think they did. What would they even burn? Middle of. Oh Wow, this is a real bodies now you keep showing us pictures of the movie, but what would they burn? They burn whatever's inside that plane leftover like clothes, shirts. That would go quick. You've got to find some woods. You've got to find some trees. There's nothing up there. If they're way above the timberline. Yeah. And probably a bunch of people broken up there. Probably a bad backs and fucked up while they're all fucked up on the accident that she, I remember that movie was so fucked up. It's a, it's a terrifying thing. Well, thousand feet altitude to wait 12,000, 11,008. That's like literally

Speaker 3:          01:43:52       just above the tail or no, no, no, no. Timberline is like 13, five or something. You know what they give you when you have altitude sickness and you're at that height? Cialis. So boner pills, boner pills. They want to get hard, so you just don't get it. Models, boner pills. They give you a bottle of skiing down the hill, which is a fucking hard dick. The, um, what those things do is dilate. They dilate your muscles and apparently that helps you breathe easier when you're at high altitude it. Well it definitely does because they have like we go to breckenridge every year, we have family up there and uh, we sleep there house is uh, you know, halfway up the side mountain we sleep at about 11 to 11,000, 200 feet. That's, that takes a while to adapt to not easy. Well if we go to Denver for three or four days, but three days beforehand you get it a little easier, you get a little bump easier.

Speaker 3:          01:44:44       But I'm not, what else is not just there's, there's another one that's just that almost the same kind of a breakfast, one of the highest out there. But yeah, we sleep at like 11 to like 10. It's like anywhere from 10, 10, seven right out, right near like near the house and then till like 11, two is where it usually ends up cause I've got my altimeter on my phone. I'm always like, I wonder how high. Yeah, I use one of those two. I just want to, I was like no one and doesn't have work. Even if you don't have service. Yeah. How's that work? Well, do the things are still sending data even if you don't have service GPS? Yeah. Yeah. We've just accepted that the government's tracking us. Right. I'm fine with it. We'll do it. When this thing, when I first got to Japan, the first thing that I did, I was like, hello?

Speaker 3:          01:45:19       Yeah. It flips over and it tells you exactly where you are without, there was no service on it. It was like poop pinpoint that Google maps was like, oop, you're right there. Whoa. This is a trip, dude. It's never not sending and receiving data. Right. Constantly been on airplane mode. Still sending and receiving data. Well, I knew this lady used to work for CNN and when she would go to places, um, if they, if you had an iphone, like she would go to these Middle Eastern places. Do they have to talk to people and interview them? They would take your phone away if you had an iphone, if you had an android phone, they take the battery out. And the olden days. Right. But if you had an iphone, they just say, no, we're taking that phone shit. You're being tracked and listened to 100% period.

Speaker 3:          01:45:54       You're in some fucking bow rain place. Some weird fucking, they take away your eye, go with your phone. That's what she would meet with these people. Do you do that at shows? By the way, do you take away, do you do now you do the pouch thing, the yonder patches, patches rather. It's a great idea. I've heard changes the game. It changes the show. It's like first of all you could always, if you have important phone calls I have to do is just leave the room. The phone will ring, you leave the room, you open the pouch. Once you get out of the room and you can come back in and put it back in the pouch, you come back in. So we did. Touches are not with them that their stretches with you. Oh you saved the pocs. They have the key. Yeah. Fronts all locked up.

Speaker 3:          01:46:28       Right. And when you go out, they opened it up like people will, I'm not giving my phone up. You don't have to give your phone using your hands, but you're in this pouch and when you go out they open, the pouch takes three seconds, it opens up, you get the phone out. So if you'd like, say if you have a babysitter at your house or something like that issue you can check it. But in the pouch it doesn't disable the phone from not getting service or anything. See that's what I think they should figure out. Well cause it's a public service to the phone. If there was an urgency though, see that would, that would prevent, see what the thing is that's good about the pouch is that if you really like, if there's some critical issue that you think could come up, I know your phone's ringing like okay I'm going to leave the drain.

Speaker 3:          01:47:04       But then it gives people incentive to still have their phone on to ring. Do you know what I mean? That is true. That is true to me is saying like, you know what's true. How often did the emergent, if the show is two hours in an emergency happens within that gap of time of two hours. Isn't that the University of Spain like this is life. The fuck the fuck. What the fuck? You have kids that nobody wants to hear that. No, totally. I get that, but it's also like, I just feel like, you know, this show is so much fucking better to way better without the phone. Have you done one of those shows? No, you should come with me. We'll do a do a gig together. I would love that because the idea of it, I thought when I heard it I was like, that's the most brilliant shit I've ever heard in my life.

Speaker 3:          01:47:40       It's phenomenal. I'm telling you, it's phenomenal. I think gets people mentally in a place where they're like, I'm just gonna enjoy the shelf. Exactly. Yeah. I don't have to fucking think about nonsuit. Everybody's got their phone up everywhere you go. They have their phone up film and everything. They want to film everything and want to take pictures of everything and it's a distraction. I just went to go see the friend of a friend play, you know, like abandoned. Uh, even that like small nonsense venues, people sell their fault. I'm not talking like, you know, it's like fuck it. And you know, a massively famous like Bruno Mars, like every kid. I'm sure it's like good the whole time. Of course. Even like a small, tiny little venue where I was like 80 people all have their phones out too. I thought those would just be a little bit more chill.

Speaker 3:          01:48:18       I think it's less of an issue with music, although some people do have an issue with it. But I'm, with music, you're in, you're the, you already know the songs. Yeah. Like with jokes, like say if you're working on a new hour, right? And you go to the laugh factory and five people in the audience are filming you and they want to put it on youtube. Like your, your jokes are half Kodaly. You're trying, comedy is one of the weird art forms because you have to practice it in front of other people. Right? You could write it alone, but you really don't know how it goes together until you try it in front of other people. And out of all the bits that you have, how many of them start off and they eat dick? Most? Almost all of them. There's like one or two that you do that you right away that hits and you're like, oh right, fuck yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:48:59       All right, that's good. From start desperately bad. And to try to figure out how to make it work somewhere. Where the fuck is it? You know? And you're trying to convey that to them. You're like, trust me, this is not your, you just haven't heard it yet. It's just you'll hear it in a year, come back in a year, the [inaudible] and even then like even when you got something down, like sometimes I'd take a chance with it, like maybe I'm not totally done with this. We take it out on a left turn. You're like, Ooh, oh, I've talked to like stuff. When I find that I tried once and I hated it and like a year later and then I tried again. And it works. Yeah. That's weird. That I love. Yeah. Well you don't even know why. Like what's wrong with me then? And write with me now.

Speaker 3:          01:49:37       Something about the rhythm of the way you even thought about it. Like I think sometimes when I get an idea of a joke and the rhythm of the joke, I can't even find, like I'm like, I don't even know why. I just kinda liked the idea that for some reason and then a year or two later you're like, something else usually happens that goes, that's just like when I felt blank and then these things kind of like Mesh together. It was just like the missing piece. Well, what's in your head is so important. That's why Theo Vaughn so fucking funny. It's my guy because Theo's act is like so ridiculous. Oh, and when you see it, if you saw it on paper, there's a lot of bits that you'd see on paper. You how, what does that, that's funny. And then you see him live, you're like, ah, it's amazing.

Speaker 3:          01:50:15       In his head he knows why. That's funny. Right? He knows why that's funny. And then he tells it to you in the way that it's going on in his head and you start fucking howling. Right. But like if you're not totally sure if it's funny, which you usually aren't when you're trying something out on stage, they can kind of tell. Totally. You're not totally sure the money. So if someone films that and then puts it on youtube, if that's not good, like say me, maybe I'm an Andrew Santino fan and I go as new bits kind of suck. I'm like, no, just say you haven't really seen him. Yeah. This is a, it's an embryo. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You saw the beginning stages of what is going to be, yeah. That's stuff. That's the whole filming of, uh, of, of shows. And they still, they bus people at the store all the time for her trying to do that.

Speaker 3:          01:50:57       But there's still people that tried to get away with it. They UCP poking up there for just fans. Some of them are just fans. I would say most people are just a fan. They just want to have that little piece. But I just think there's always fucking people that are up to no good. Well, there's always people that are just, first of all this people that if you're a performer and they're not a performer, they don't give a fuck total like they're not, they're not looking out for you. They say, Hey, I'm fucking audience. Whenever you worry about you, you're doing it. I'm a fucking guy who films I've paid to be here, pal. Yeah, that's what I do. All right, and you're a performer guy, so fucking perform performer. I film this next performer guy coming to the stage. You're going to love him.

Speaker 3:          01:51:34       Someone said this to sturgeon, a sturgill simpson comes up to him in an airport and sticks a fucking camera in his face when he's talking to his friend and his friend are talking to guys like holding the camera. He's like, what are you doing man? He was, hey, it's a price you pay, bro. Fuck what he says to them. It's the price you pay that nothing drives me more insane. When people say Shit like that, the price you pay. I just decided that's what comes along with the territory. Hey attacks, bro. Time to pay the same tax tax. I stand in front of you. When you talked to your friend, like in any other world that would be so rude. Like if you were just standing by talking to your friend and both of you are an insurance salesman and a guy came up and put a phone in your face, you'd be like, what the fuck is this guy?

Speaker 3:          01:52:13       I'm insured by state farm so I get to do this. It's just price. You pay, you want to be in public. I get the film yet like that's a, that's a thing that people have decided, right? Some people in their head like this guy with a camera that if you are a famous person, like anything you do. Yup, I'm allowed to film you everywhere you go. I'll take pictures because he does this because there's this big disconnect that that people that are famous are people. There's this thing that's like, no, you're ours now. We we, we made you famous so now you're ours. Whatever we want from you. That that idea is fucking crazy to me that someone's like, they're barely human. Sometimes they don't treat people like they're not human. They're just, you know, it was pretty good at it. Pretty good. Is the TMZ guys for the most part and they come up to with the cameras, they're very good guys.

Speaker 3:          01:52:56       Like for the most part, yeah. A lot of them are actually comics. They're like, do it as a few of them. I knew where comics that are struggling and they meet people, the airport and asking weird questions and shit. Most of the time it's no big deal. I'll see. I'll go cheese or Cheddar. It's one of those kids, they have the fucking weirdest. Oftentimes the questions are so like, yeah, well they're just trying to get something, but that's how they're getting by, you know? Totally. But it's just, there's almost never a good idea to answer those questions. Oh, did you look like a fucking idiot? No matter what. Like, oh, someone got Anthony Bordain at the airport and they said, if you were going to cook dinner for Donald Trump and Kim Jong Moon, what would you serve? And he says, hemlock. And then all the magma assholes went fucking crazy. That's a porridge. And he's threatening to kill the president. That said, someone called the finger fair with and juvenile arrested fucking maggot hats, all filled with sweat around the brim for anything like a foot. His hat smells like a foot going to kill the president. Mr Mr. Secret service agent. I want you to rest on your birthday. There's no joking about the pregnant.

Speaker 3:          01:54:07       Meanwhile all he does is crack jokes. Yeah, I wish he really did say that. That motherfucker line while he was president. Come on. I mean, that shit would be hilarious if he did that as president. What would everybody do? Go. Oh, you're not allowed to do that. He wrote right now the president to not to not cuss. That's kind of like a, but I think that like when he tweeted it, Kim Jong, who to call him little rocket man. That was hilarious. So funny. That was hilarious. Just plain funny. Well, he goes, did you see the one tweet? He goes, I don't know why Kim Jong Moon said I was old. I would never say he short and fat. It's like a return to like comic. Yeah. As I go, I don't smack that did go to your work. It's making the exact same thing. Yeah. That's so funny.

Speaker 3:          01:54:51       But it mean the fact that he just like this was, this is the president saying this fuss funny. It's fucking hilarious. But meanwhile, Kim Jong Moon now wants to sign a peace treaty. They want to meet, they're going to meet, they're going to meet. Nobody wanted to meet with him before. Everybody's like, just too dangerous. So I never call him, showed him fat. Oh, whenever I tried so hard to be as friend and maybe some day that'll happen. Yes. He, he, he shits on you, shows you the consequences if you fucking with him and then he opens up. That's kind of what we do anyway. That's like what friends do that you like? You Shit on each other and then you're like, dude, I love you. It's because I fucking, maybe someday that will happen. Oh well I try so hard to be his friend. This guy. Come on, man, this look I'm not, there's a lot of things this guy does wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:55:34       Fucking entertaining, very entertaining. There's no, never been a more entertaining president. Not even close. No. He is the fucking grand champion of being an entertaining for as long as he doesn't blow us up and he gets out without getting in the box like it's, it's highly possible. That doesn't make it out of this one alive, but if he does, he gets through the whole thing. I think he's going to be good. You think so? I think he'll be fine. Let me, let me say this, the last four years or eight years and look at all these in. A lot of liberals are like, what? Never. Never. Whether it lasts ever trump. If it lasts for eight years, the one thing they'll that we will all say, we'll look back on. We'll go, man, that's crazy. It took that thing for us to talk about. A lot of things like the me too movement would have never happened.

Speaker 3:          01:56:16       If Hillary got in office. Yeah it would have. Sure. I don't think so. Man. Weinstein got exposed. That's the hardest one. But I think we're, we're tumble effect of what happened with him. I agree too, but I think it all helped in together. Yeah. I, I'm just saying like I bet you the harvey thing wouldn't have been so real and Hillary got in cause it cause all the liberals that condemned all the liberals, like all the liberals that called out, people like harvey and everyone in our business, they would have been so gleeful of this hillary thing. I think that would've still been like, ah, well we'll cover it up like we've been doing for the [inaudible]. It's not like it just started, it's been going on. Why? Why not suppress stories before because they, they got these people to support. I just think the power of social media, it's just, I think the timing was perfect with trump.

Speaker 3:          01:56:59       I think. I'm just saying like I think, think so. I think those things led to it just being like, all right, that's it. We have to do something. I think it was definitely a factor, but I bet you it wouldn't happen so fast with Hillary. I bet you that would have been a longer road. Oh yeah, dude. I Dunno. Because liberals would have gotten exactly what they wanted. The only way it would have been a longer rows because Weinstein supported Hillary's camp. That's what I'm saying. That is possible. All part of the same cause there's a lot of photos of them together. Put Him with Obama, but he's got photos of everybody. Yeah. Everybody liked him just hugging up on all these people that call him a monster now. Yeah. Things out. He's a god. Like Meryl Streep Saves a God. Yeah, a godsend. It's a sod sense.

Speaker 3:          01:57:34       The same thing with trump though. Like how many celebrities you see with pictures of trump? It's hysterical. Killer. Diehard liberals that are like, they asked me to, you have your parents buds and all that shit. They asked me to do the apprentice when I was doing the second round of fear factor. When you said, no way, I don't want to live in New York for three months and that's it. My kid was one of my, my youngest kid was very young. Who is going to be on the show. I don't know. No idea. I would have loved to see who he would've gone up with. Dude. I would've been so Dennis Rodman, non competitive. I would have been high as fuck Cindy Lopper time. Oh. To try to come up with a good idea. And if it didn't work, now you have a two to one. That's why.

Speaker 3:          01:58:07       Cause you didn't care. Yeah. The people that care, that's who, that's who loses. I don't know man. I cared so little that I probably would lose. I think you'd win. I probably would barely the person that's like, man, I forgot. I'm, don't you have to be good at business. I'm fucking terrible at business. Like what would you, some of the people on that show, they just, they're all doing it. They don't know. I mean that like who they cast on it. They wing it. It's like whoever they guess. I've seen literally 13 seconds of that show and it's all clips. You're fired, you're fired, you're fired. That's the best clip you're fired. I just, I don't get it. I just did. Just didn't seem like a fun show. I wish she came at her

Speaker 1:          01:58:41       fired. I would add McDonald's with you. I don't eat that shit. I do. Ali, yours. He eats fried chicken with a fork and knife. Dude, that's it. This guy, he's a cop. He's a comic act. She's a comic that he is a cartoon. He's an odd and that's for sure. Do you think he's gonna run again? 100% right when he was gonna win again, 100% he's going to win again. Yeah. Wow. And I'm not saying like, of course there's people that are probably like, fuck dude, I just need to come to my boy hearts gallery and same, I never trump exhibited that was burned to the ground by Mexicans. How ironic. Nazi coffee. I just think, I think he's going to win again. I just do. I think unless the Democrats can pull something together in the next year and a half, two years to someone that actually is like a formidable component. Well my activism is going to prevent that.

Speaker 1:          01:59:30       I just, I just think he's going to go again. He might look if he's smart and he clearly is a very clever man. If he's a clever man, it's entirely possible that he's got one round in the chamber for like right around six to eight weeks out totally before the election. One thing where he like let something happen or shit goes down and he has the perfect solution to put out that fire and he's good to go. They plan that stuff, man. Absolutely. People working on it right now. The moment you get into office, they're trying to keep you in office and sometimes people die and it dumps all day. Yeah. Sometimes people die and he's just, hey, we're going to do, what does this President Johnson's marines, what'd he say to soldiers in the space? He wants to create a space for us. Oh, what dude?

Speaker 1:          02:00:21       Fuck yeah. Why did he say let's shoot up the strategy for space recognizes that space as a war fighting domain. Well, just like the land, air and sea. I don't like the way he says this. He even have us. For us. We have the space for us with the navy and a space for us. So what did he does is he has a bunch of buddies that make spaceships. So what he's going to do is they make a fucking deal, mechanized deal, mechanized deal. We sat down and we got a nice deal and they're going to take another $4 trillion and pump it into the space for us. And then they're going to, they're all going to wear like Luke skywalker outfit, right? They're all going to wear some sort of crazy space suit that looks dope and we're going to be all on board. Yeah. Space Wars for dude. Tight give. Imagine we start seeing like overhead, like we're in the sky a button. We'll look at an and the night sky and you see like a rocket ship flying back and forth part of that, uh, the tesla thing. So cool. It's showing the u s air force some maneuverability thing, whatever that was like the last hour of the testing experiment with showing them something that they could do that wasn't really being talked about because the Eli musk shooting that car in this space. It's so funny. Trump must so many people nervous

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       and other countries like this, like just have him talking about it. Space war, just as just talking to so flippantly. I think a lot of people, a lot of people in other countries like him, I think there, I think there are hammered by his, his just complete disregard for rules. I think people love that. He just doesn't give a shit. You think so? I think so. Totally choose a terrified that this guy is running America. I think like our friends do, but I think that the majority of the other countries that don't give a shit about us are like, that guy's great. I think our friendly countries, you know like England, I'm sure it's like he's a nuisance, you know? But I think, I think countries don't give a fuck about us are like, that guy's hilarious. That guy's a weirdo space war. Imagine we had a space where we in Russia.

Speaker 3:          02:02:22       That would be fucking awesome. Be a great movie. Like how do we stop a war from breaking out who? Who was going to stop a war from breaking out? Nobody took. It seems like they just keep pushing each other. Like someone's going to throw a sucker punch. Yeah. It's going to happen. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's do it. Yeah. And then finally they're in the fucking hallway and they're pushing each other. Right? No one wants to step two, keep hitting one or two books out of each other's hands. Yeah. And it's always right there. So always right there.

Speaker 4:          02:02:52       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:52       Then finally someone takes the hit. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:02:55       Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:02:56       I mean, it could easily happen with some little banana republic. Right? That could start it off. Some crazy dictator in Venezuela or some shit could send a missile at some other dude, fuck him up and like, oh bitch, that we're doing now. And then we backed discount and then the Russians back, the other guys. And next thing you know it, old jetson millionaire and we're in a fucking war. I mean, which were so weird about war. It's like we accept the fact that war exists, but only when it's not near us. Not really interested in more. That's clothes. Can't be here. Like we have war in Afghanistan. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that's inevitable. But war over here, it's like, no, no way. No Way. No, no, you can't. We don't. But if we're going to have war over here, I hope we can contain it to like, you know, like North Dakota or are you somewhere where I'm not near some weird spot.

Speaker 3:          02:03:44       Some spot where we're like to fight in the middle with it and a lot of shit all over the spot. You can have that area go fight right here. Yeah. If we flew right here would be good. Would it be the one like we all designated this is the place we meet. We fuck each other up. What state? Connecticut. Connecticut. Yeah, for sure. Nobody would cry. Fuck it. That's like, that's like afterschool fist fights of like a, you are the secret garden dude. I'm gonna fuck you up. You know, and you'd wait all day. People be talking about it like you heard about the fat ass bro, you to go the bass pro meet me in Connecticut.

Speaker 3:          02:04:13       You want to solve this the right way, dog, you mean Connecticut? Oh, I hope we don't get in a war now, but we're in one. Yeah, see that's the thing. Like we are one with some dudes who brought goats and they live in the mountains. Yeah, we're in one with those guys, but yeah, yeah, yeah. But this is over there. It's just doing, I go to starbucks every day. I don't feel it. I don't, it's one of those that were at the war. I go to him and get my Nazi coffee out in boyle heights and I'm straight. It's white people coffee, weird white coffee,

Speaker 1:          02:04:38       wp coffee. It's just crazy that they could just scream, fuck white people. And everybody's like, well, you know, they don't want to be gentrified. No. They'll know some of their say and somebody saying, I mean, they don't want white people moving in and opening up galleries. You know, what's another part of it? This is where it gets really weird. So I went into rabbit hole. I started reading a lot of Isabella. What I read was that part of it is being hijacked by white artists that don't like the people that own the gallery. So they get on the side of the people that want no gentrification and they sabotage the gallery because they have a personal feud with the guy who owns the gallery does so far, so there was a lot of that. It was white artists that we're teaming up against the white people.

Speaker 1:          02:05:22       They're teaming up on the side of the Hispanics to get, yeah, Mexicans, Latinos. I mean, I don't know if it's all Mexicans. I think east side is heavy. There's a Honduran is all, I mean it's just that neighborhood. It's just a, it's generally known as a Latino neighborhood. Totally. And these people want to keep it that way, but, but it's just so fucked up. Imagine if that was white people. If Brown people were moving in and white people, were we going to fuck brown art and fuck the Nazis hate racism against white people? We don't automatically see it as racism, including the people that are saying fuck white art. Like they don't think of it as racism because it's against the people that are moving in that happened to be wealthy, that can afford to buy, totally pushing people out. So if you say fuck white people, it's not racist.

Speaker 1:          02:06:14       But the same people that agree with that, you know, the same people that are like that or like that or like the same white people that agree with the protesting, they're rich. They're already up there anyway, there's a little bit of that and there's just, it's convenient because they're not that thing. It's like I read, um, this one woman was tweeting that a, here's an unpopular opinion and not at all uncomfortable about the idea of men being falsely accused of sexual assault and sexual harassment. Like that is a crazy thing to say. Like what if it was your son would, if it was your brother, what was it? What if it was your dad and they were a good person and accused of something. You're, you're not, you don't feel bad because you don't like men. All men suck. Is that what it is? Yeah, that is sexist.

Speaker 1:          02:06:54       But they do, you might not think it's sexist, but it's fucking sex. It's hardcore sex. If all men suck, if all men were violent monsters, girls, you'd all be dead. Right? Okay. You'd all be dead. Someone along the way would have done something terribly. So we're not all bad. No. Some of us are bad men are bad and that I want to, I don't, I won't even say us. Some males of the species are bad. Some females are bad. Yes. Where's that? That's not even a part of it. It's like people are bad. I don't understand this whole thing. Like all people are good. Most people, I think people are good, are good, but a lot of people are not good. There's a lot of people. So if there's, like we were talking about the, the number of, uh, what was the, that weird statistic about that. We pulled up one

Speaker 2:          02:07:36       out of a 0.6% what was that? That we were just discussing? Yes. Micro Penis people. Right. So if that's how many people have a micro penis, how many people are fucking assholes? Right? More than have micro penises. Way More. Yeah. So if you have a hundred people right and 0.6 have a micro penis to are assholes flaming assholes. And imagine being an asshole and having a micro penis, you're in trouble. You got a real pro, you probably never developed like real asshole tendencies cause you know, it'd be so intimidated at someone in the middle of a ramp, just pull your pants down, shut the fuck up. And then everyone's like, oh my God, there's way more assholes. But some of those assholes are women. So like on national women's day the other day, like a couple people that I know retweeted this, someone was like believe women.

Speaker 2:          02:08:28       Trust women, embrace women, support women. There's some, yes, some are great, some women are amazing, some men are amazing, some humans are amazing. It can be amazed. It's whole like gravitating towards one gender specifically just because they have a vagina or specifically just because they have a penis is equally stupid, equally stupid on both sides, and it also creates divisiveness. Right? It creates conflict because you were aware us on the team penis, that you're fully in supportive team vagina. That's all you're about, right? You're about teen vagina and you know it was over here as a penis fan. I'm like, this is bullshit. You know, I'm willing to tolerate those vagina fans, but they're shitting all over paid as this hidden tardy you shitting on penis? I'm getting tired of it enough. You know, it's like Ken, the dolphins and the raiders have a healthy relationship amongst the fans.

Speaker 2:          02:09:23       Can they get together and share a stadium together without any gang fights? Nothing. Impossible. Nope. Not In that example. No, no, but it's the same thing with team penis versus team vagina. Here's an unpopular opinion. I'm not at all uncomfortable with raiders fans getting gang raped or stomped to death in the parking lot. Fuck the raiders Hashtag fuck the raiders, right? Yeah. That's something a retard would say. Write a really stupid fuck who was like a, uh, you know, uh, anti raiders guy would say something like that and you'd get like a hundred likes. Fuck gone. Fuck all call home. Fuck Gum. I hate the future is female quote. I think it's such an annoying cook. A good luck just eating each other's pussies. You crazy bitches, but we're never going to get pregnant. It's an insane thing to say. It's so annoying. It's a stupid thing to say.

Speaker 2:          02:10:09       What are you really saying? No one masculine. Yeah. Right. Imagine what a piece of shit you'd have to be to walk around with tee shirt. This is the future as mass masculine bid. Oh No. The future is human beings. Hopefully we're nice to each other, getting along, doing each other good and being right to one another. We're all, we're all important. All of us males, females, everyone. Yeah. This whole ecosystem needs each other. It's so funny, but women can walk around those futures, female shirts and not feel stupid. That's fucking because it's a big, if it's supported, right, it's, hey, what should we say that tell me I'm a fucking love. First of all, love your shirt. Amazing. It's amazing. I'm with you. 100% sister. They can do that here, but I'm here to tell you, you go do that in certain parts of the country and people are like, fuck is that shit?

Speaker 2:          02:10:53       The fuck is that dog? It's crazy when it's heterosexual women. Can you imagine if Mensa, Doug futures masculine, we're just going to wrench, we're going to be done with all this girl short or just right. Squirrel's suck. Come here Steve. Yeah, it's stupid. It's stupid like this. It is general. I mean it does like taking one gender and deciding that's what you're really into, that it's just as stupid as take you one skin color. Totally. Just as stupid as I am. Really only in the dudes were over six feet tall. I'm six feet tall. Should be dead. I don't want to talk to them. I have a team, Marty team, six feet. We can always decide some new thing that we don't like somebody about. Right or four and so we always decide like, hey, those fucking assholes from when the town across the tracks, like we'll have like a boundary line. This side, those people with them imaginary wise, we put up a fence. Fuck you, fuck them, we'll stay. We're going to meet in the parking lot on Saturday night and if they don't say that we're the best, we're going to fucking kill them.

Speaker 2:          02:11:56       It's and people don't see it for whatever reason. If you have a future is female tee shirt on, you don't see it that way because you are just in support of feminism and the support of equal rights and supportive women doing powerful things and you think this is a step in the right direction, but it's not. No. The future is females, not a, that's not a message that is good. The future is happy, loving people. That's a good message. Good. The future is good, honest people not not fucking hurting each other. People trying to do well for each other, trying to facilitate communication and growth and learning about each other and tolerance like just be nice to each other, not the future's masculine. Fuck off you dork. You've fucking half a man. You have a man. Imagine if a guy's, he's got the t shirt that says the future is male.

Speaker 2:          02:12:41       He's a tattoo. It's right above his dick. He shows it sometimes. Sometimes you could see like the top letters because it's shaped like a, like got a big smiley face. It's a smile, but it says the future's masculine. He could see the e and the t poking out of his underwear when he takes those Dick route pictures. You know those pictures of guys take with, they pull the pants down time. Yeah. You know those, those guys, they'll, they'll take a picture, they're painting the fuck runway and all that shit right to the Dick root sweatpants and just get back from the gym. Like basically showing the base of their cock. Cause I got the fucking, the runners, the fuck runner muscles. The fuck muscles. Yeah. That's where Jamie's got that. The future is masculine. Quote. Did you get it removed? Second. I need to go back. You can't go just once. Yeah. It takes a long time. Lasers above your deck has to be very nerve wracking. You know they make you put goggles on

Speaker 1:          02:13:34       when they were moving. Tattoos, pop, pop, pop. So painful. It's like this shoot a laser. It's, it looks like the most painful shit I've ever seen in my lessons. Crackling, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. Then listen to it as, oh it's fucking awful. You're cooking, you're cooking the skin, right? Yeah. Yeah. You have to burn it. You have to burn it. Yeah.

Look at, the guy's got to get goggles on. It's so funny. I'm like, you have tattoos. I know you have tons of tattoos. I'm not thinking cause I'm not seeing any. Well I'm covered up. Yeah, but you will often cover him up. Well, because they're a distraction like on stage. Yeah, you do that. He's just going over. That's pretty amazing. How quick it makes it disappear. Is that new someone the other day that was just like, she was going over the skin and it was not, it didn't seem like it was harming the untattooed so you know what they say? It's kind of like, um, it looks, it looks whoa. That's crazy. That is fucking crazy. But you still have to go back a bunch.

Speaker 1:          02:14:56       Yeah. Maybe you do bro. I got one stocky. I go once bro. Um, it seems like it would be amazing where, where's that shit that was in?

You'd have to go to a master tattoo artist. Wow. This guy covering his eyes. He's got tattoos all over his face. Holy Shit Man. I am seeing more that than I've ever seen in my life. That's the new shit dude. Wow. Quick. That works man. That's incredible. So this is a, how old's that article? Like new, it's pretty new this year, so I don't know if there's any places.

What about the future is masculine maybe should all get that and maybe I'll give shit. Yeah, I might get that, but I want to get it above my butt.

Speaker 1:          02:16:58       the fuck Outta here. Bitch. Done. That looks pretty dope, dude. I might have to go get that shit done because I've been putting off getting this tattoo. Who's the broad at the bottom? I don't know. Yeah, she's good. Like she's like, Hey, I had one about my box and uh, they took it out.

Speaker 3:          02:17:14       She's a bunch of, she had a bunch of gang stuff on her forehead, wants a Dick's point into my brother. I was a kid. I was a gang that was in a gang. Just disappears. I love that. Revealing a beautiful future. This is the real truth. This is how it actually happens, you know, and I, you know what I need in here right now. I need a pee bucket. I have to pee so bad. And you're like, hey man, don't worry about it. We'll talk shit about you while you're gone. What makes him comfortable that we talk about, we'll start with that. The future is masculine.

Speaker 1:          02:17:42       Just makes me sad. I get the Sun. I'm a hypocrite though because like one of my favorite fighters, Cain Velasquez, he's got brown pride tattooed on his chest. Never bothered me for a second. His Dad walked here from fucking Mexico and you know like if you're a part of a disenfranchised community, if you feel like you are and you have that on, it's like you're taking pride in something that's considered maligned. Right. But I guess women would think the same way in a more mild way that they're disenfranchised to where are they going to do with all their, that tramp stamp thing that's done right. No, some girls are still getting them now. Yeah. Really. It's some dumb people out there bro.

Speaker 1:          02:18:24       Okay. But what does the tramp stamp? A tramp stamp is only when it's your lower back. Right. But your whole back like I know a lot of people that are getting their whole back done. Right. That's, that's, that's, I mean they're getting there but done everything, which I think is probably not the best move. Cause like acids look really good when they're well formed. Like to put, you know what it's like. It always seems to me what he's showing me. Wow. Look at that. God Damn, that's gorgeous. Look, go back to that. A full screen like grill below goal. Go below. Go below. Sorry. There's a tiger low right that, that screen. Look at that one right there. Bam. Look at that back. Holy Shit. That's crazy. That's really good work. Who made that one? Does it say, I'll just says a hundred awesome back tattoo ideas.

Speaker 1:          02:19:14       Yeah. I just think, ladies, leave your ass alone. Please don't get crazy. Wow. Like, or if you're asked is so good, you could tattoo the shit out of it and still looks amazing, but you gotta be really careful what artists you go to. That is the thing about tattoos. You got to really make sure like a, before I got my sleep, I got my sleeves done by this guy, Aaron Dellavedova. Shout out to Aaron from Guru Tattoo in San Diego. I'd seen his work online a bunch. I mean, he's a real legit artist. His work's amazing. I knew that this guy was like super good at tattoos, but there's a lot of people that get some whack ass tattoos. I don't want to stand out. People don't have time. They don't have the patience to wait for that good artist or we get nutty. I need it today, you know? Do you have tattoos all over his Dick Davies, that one that we saw about a one removed. Get a better one that we know. Have you seen they have glow in the dark tattoos now? Yeah. Gotta be good for you. Yeah. Right. Whatever. It makes it fall on the dark. Definitely not going to fuck you up for the rest of your life. It's all natural. Yeah. As far as we know, if you were going to get a tattoo, what do you think you'd get?

Speaker 4:          02:20:22       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:20:22       so I don't eat pride. Yeah. Or like, well, white power maybe. Wow. Darn Tattoos. That's amazing. That looks fucking cool. Wow. Shit. Look it. Look it. Look, that's amazing. Holy Shit Dude. That would back up to that last one that you just went to know what? The girls back right there. No to the right of that one to the right of that one. No, look at that picture over the top bar and go to the right of it. The one that did. That's it. There you go. Bam. Look at that. Wow. Fuck Dude.

Speaker 4:          02:20:51       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:20:51       That's a good someone's arm. Raise that someone arms. Does that an arm? Yeah. Oh, I thought it was her back. Oh, I thought it was like leaning forward. Buck. That's incredible. That's amazing. Yeah. Then you have black lights over your house. Like your college again though. Whoa. Yeah. Right. Like your whole house is a college dorm. You have to have black lights everywhere and you have to have like a empty booze bottles filled with like uh, things that make them glow and shit. Every room you go into as a college dorm because you are the black light light poster. That's what I get. Probably something to throw something representative of Chicago back home.

Speaker 3:          02:21:21       Jeff fucking Chicago is a town, a deep dish pizza in a brand, like get a old style and a hat dog on my shoulder. Shit, a snow shovel and a fucking bratwurst. He's got a high cholesterol chart reading everything. He was up at the top problem, probably fine, but everybody's fine. Don't worry about it. Everyone's got affect gut and then find and a big smile heard you make it fun. Or Joe Rogan's making fun of us stowed on a line. Should in Chicago. Tell him to fuck off. That's what I say to Joe Rogan. Swell. Boycott your fucking shitty show on June 8th. Hey is Joe Rogan Chin na Seth Rogan's to get a browder's Joe Rogan Jay know it and they know each other. These different than that other guy right in front Guy Seth Rogen,

Speaker 1:          02:22:08       he not fake. Got Mad at me. He goes, everyone spells my name wrong cause are you? Sorry Dude. Who is this? A dumb way of spelling it. You got to stop using an e at the end. Rogin rock n roll again. It's Rogan, Rogan, R. G. A. N. S. English. Mine's Irish. His, his English. Some. Did you see this crazy soccer? Yeah, this is $500. Uh, gravity bomb. It's a little too much for gravity bong, but you just smoke a joint. $500 for gravity bong. But I look at it, it looks crazy. Yeah. Shares with a real good idea. Look, we were joint wash and flipped it. Look at a flips a shit. Right. Upside down. Lighter. Yeah. Gas Station. Lighter joint. Oh, we're good. You don't need a $500 bond. Seth Rogan so serious.

Speaker 1:          02:22:54       I handed him stoner of the year award once one of the high times awards, 500 bucks out of the wood. That's ridiculous. People are always trying to give me these fucking things. Did you get stoner of the year award? Yeah, I got it once right. Did I get it? They were offering it to me. I think I might have had to go to get it. As you said, you probably were like, I can't go man. Yeah. I'm Muslim gun and go. I'm not going to say I can't go. I hosted the doobies one year, which was fun. It was like an award show that was in like 2001 yeah. And then, uh, I gave an award to seth rogen and another time, but they've asked me to perform at those before and I did it once. Where the doobies it's just everyone's high as a kite. It's all weird.

Speaker 1:          02:23:36       It's this, I mean you just, there's so out of it. Crazy show ever. It's the underground comedy show in Toronto. Do you haven't done that place dude, they have a bong shop and in the back room it's all a comedy show, but it's all people smoking pot in the room. It's a hot button while you're doing the show. Yeah, they have bongs on the tables, dude. People are blitzkrieg. You are so high when you're on stage, you can't remember what you were talking about three seconds ago. I mean it's so bad and it's thick. Like smoke everywhere. Like the hope, there's no ventilation kit to material. You just have to go fuck around. Yeah. I mean you could try to do material. I definitely have tried, but like I took Tripoli there and aaa doesn't really get high. Um, at least he didn't. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          02:24:23       I don't think he does time. I think he might've been sober, but dude, he got blitzkrieg just breathing the air in this place. Fucking ripped the whole, the whole place is bomb was, I don't think it was a, I don't think anyone bombed Syria bomb venue where you're like, I'm never going to do well in here. They don't fucking, they're not paying attention. You're just out of it. It's just the whole thing. You're off, everything's off. Right. You're so hot. But that's also where I did a thing on the iron sheik came on stage and that place you ever seen that video of the iron cheek? Joe Rogan's and he starts talking to me and that's when I realized the price that pro wrestlers pay, like the health, like this poor fellows in crutches and shit. He could barely walk. That's him and me on stage.

Speaker 7:          02:25:16       Fuck Joe Rogan chocolates. Sparkling three stolen gutter quarter Roman or you have the toughest sport in the Olympics is freestyle wrestling serve. I'm so nerdy because he know to you. I didn't know how to change lights

Speaker 1:          02:25:45       of my life being on stage. Hi is giraffe pussy talking to the iron cheek in a room with a pot leaf behind me. That's a big old pot leaf. Was He ripped him sober? I in the house. There was no one sober in that place. I don't, I don't, I literally don't think it would be possible to be sober in that room. I just don't think you could be. There's no air in that room. They trap you. Yeah, I like all the fire. There's fire like the little candles and stuff on a table and like it's running an air. They don't have any air to stay lit. The flame is flickering out so we didn't smoke in here. Everybody's like lists like the whole August lights, candles burn on weed. Joe. It's fine. But the shows, they're always real weird. People go there and just, it's in Vancouver?

Speaker 1:          02:26:25       No, it's Toronto. Toronto, Toronto. I forget what it's called. Comedy underground or something like that. Puff Puff Mama around comedy club. Underground comedy club. Yeah. We've done it a couple of times and he's still doing shows and shit there. I don't know. They think so. Yeah. They don't give up. They forgot every time they get to high, they forgot they got through high. We had to stop it, but we didn't remember. Dude, who's coming up there? Give them a plug. Underground comedy Puff Mama. Dot. Ca. There you go. Fun Fun place though. And very, very nice people did it a few times. Dope. And they did tell a bunch of people that I was coming and it wasn't coming and then people got mad at me and I'm like, Hey, Yay. I didn't fucking say I was coming. Somebody set up a fund in there somewhere. Promotes your shit and you're like, did I say it or did you hear it from another party?

Speaker 1:          02:27:09       He didn't hear me promising you fucking boom. What you going to be there bro? We got tickets. Told the truth before. Joel, get tickets. Your ruler boys. Hey, just so many people, there's just so many people in the world. Where's your least favorite spot to perform? I don't really have one. There's not like a city, but what's your like, what's the least ideal situation? Much on the tag out a city. I mean like least ideal is always a late show on a Friday night in a place where people are dumb, right? And they're dumb. And then if rock, but I'll tell you what man, there is places that you go that don't get a lot of love and then when you go there, the fucking chills are awesome. Like Bakersfield was awesome. Really just did it. Just did it a couple of weeks ago. It was fucking amazing. They were incredible.

Speaker 1:          02:27:52       They were one of the, one of the best audiences ever. Lively, fun by the way. Same place to hatch. Be Mountains. That's right near where the guy killed by a bear. There will be blood. Hi, drink your milkshake. That was right there. There was that whole area. Those people are fucking great. They were cool. They were really cool that you were surprised. You sound like you're surprised. I'm like, I got to give it a try. I sought and beat burned. I talked about on a podcast like two years ago. Oh, we should do just to of tour of places where people

Speaker 2:          02:28:22       don't want to go. And I'm like, yeah, that'd be kind of fun. He and I talked about doing it and we're going to talk about doing it in Bakersfield and we never get around to doing it. And so I said, ah, I'm just gonna go by myself. So I decided to go. I had a great fucking time. It was fun. Yeah, we know those people deserve comedy too. Like it's so funny. It's like big cities. That's why when you go somewhere small, most of the time they appreciate it more cause they're like, dude, no one ever comes through here. You know what else is great? Fresno. Yeah. For, I'd never been there and done. That was great. Fucking fun, man. Did two shows in Fresno had a great time. You have no idea how many people right now in fresno and losing their minds. Know Fresno has some serious soul food, some legit shit for real soul food festivals.

Speaker 2:          02:29:01       How far? I wish I could remember the place. I got the name of the place somewhere on my phone. How far is Fresno from here? It took a solid four hour drive. Yeah. It's almost a San Francisco, right? I'm a little surprised to an hour and a half, so yeah, it's about about four hours drive. I forget the name of this fucking place. There was a soul food place in Fresno, not gonna be able to find it. See if you can google soul food in Fresno. It's one about the highly ranked rest is not a lot of choices in Fresno for food chef Paul's or dolls kitchen. I think it's chef Paul's. Can you see if you can find a picture of it? 4.6 yeah, that's the spot. It is. Chef Paul's got to be a four point next baby. They had dude, they have oxtails. They have love. I've sale.

Speaker 2:          02:29:46       That is the place. Cool artwork on the wall. That place, if you are in a near Fresno, if you're like an hour outside of Fresno drive there. If you're on your way, you're passing through and you got to ask probably not something we, their little shrimp Gumbo, dude, they had chicken and waffles. They had ribs. I had tried tip. They had a catfish. I believe they had the, but the braised oxtail was all love sharks. Tail man. So good man. They had Collard Greens. That was amazing. They had braised cabbage. That was sensational. It's a serious joint. It's one of those places where, uh, one of the main things that they serve to drink it's Koolaid and I went off the reservation, so I'm like, fuck it, I'm eating this stuff. I might as well just have a Koolaid as it was wonderful having some, some ribs and a Koolaid.

Speaker 2:          02:30:36       There's a koolaid right there, baby. Having some ribs and a Koolaid. We went there two days in a row. That's credible. When you go there, you can't fucking, you can't like health it out. You got to go. Go for cog. You got to go whole hog. If you're going to chef Paul's. So shout out to chef Paul's cafe in Fresno. Good spot. But I, you know what man, I'm, I'm having a good time doing standup. So everywhere I'm going, I'm having fun. I mean even when you go to a weird place, it's like, yeah, it's weirder. I mean it's not Anaheim, but it's weird. You know, it's fun. It's not the Irvine Improv, right, right, right. Now, see, I'm at a level where I'm still hustling through places that are just, you know, I'm, I'm having fun for a lot of places, but some places I'm just

Speaker 3:          02:31:20       like, the crowds are not that good. I don't draw enough people. So it's like, uh, it's, it's hard. I think bird talked about it. I don't know if he talked about it here, but he said like killing to the abyss. He's like, there's a part in your career when you're killing to the abyss, when you're kinda like, you're, you know, you're a pro, you are a professional, you've had accolades in the game, you've done well enough, but your fan base isn't huge enough to where you have a big following. So when you go somewhere, you crush and you'll hear afterwards someone go, you know, I've never even heard of you and we, you're one of our favorite comics now. And they do that. They do this thing where they're like, we fucking love you. Oh, I can't believe we're going to find, so you make these new fans, it's great, but it's just like you are, you are working so hard, crushing to 30 people to, you know, to earn, earn, you know, to earn. You're earning all these audiences.

Speaker 2:          02:32:03       Those times though, man, when you look back you will remember those very fondly. Well I can't forget them cause a lot of them are painful a shit. Yeah, there's going to be rough ones. But those are fucking so critical for the development of your APP.

Speaker 3:          02:32:16       Oh to it's worth. It's worth every and the, and the other thing is the places that I have built, audiences that I love, like Denver, when I go back to comedy works, I can sell that plays out because I built an audience, right? Like if I build audiences in places that really loved me, that's the best part about going to places where I'm like, you know, she, you know, they just show me so much love there that you're like, God, that's what it is. That's what it feels good.

Speaker 2:          02:32:36       Think of like if you're in a place like Denver, how many of those people that come to see you are actually going to leave comments or tweet at you? And how many of them are just gonna enjoy it? Because most of the time when I go to see somebody I just enjoy. I just enjoy it too. It's very rare that I say, hey, you have to go see this guy. Hey, this girl's here or this band or whatever it is. It's very rare, right? Most of the time I just enjoy it. So like you think about you're doing thousands of people, right? You're doing 200 was at 300 seats. How much just, yeah, so like 300 seats you doing 1200 in the two days, you know, and then you're going back again, do another 12 they'll tell their friends, people come back, tickets go quicker next time, and then a year later.

Speaker 2:          02:33:17       I mean that's, that's the key to building the road. Like to this day, there's places where I sell out wayne advance and there's other places where I haven't really haven't been going that often. And it's more of a difficulty to sell tickets because you've built up a yeah, I mean how Austin Houston's a spot where I could just, I sell on Houston. I've been selling out comedy clubs in Houston since the 90s yeah. It's like, it's always been a spot that I could cause that was like for me, Houston was one of the, there was a few cities where legends came from and Houston was wearing, Kennison came from and for me it's like Kennison and Hex Bolt came out of Houston. So for me it's like I had to get to Houston and like there's this thought in my head like I knew about the laugh stop and river oaks. It's one spot. There was the nineties I got, I got to get to that club. Like that's the spot, right. There's a fucking perfect comedy club to you. You never worked there, Huh? Who's gone before he came around?

Speaker 3:          02:34:08       I was going to say, but I've, but I've listened to many albums where they are at the laugh stop introducing

Speaker 2:          02:34:12       comic mind from 1999. Yeah, I'm from, I'm going to be dead. Some Warner brothers. That was from the last stop. I did it in Houston. I filmed in like a recorded it rather 98 or 99 and it was um, the perfect club. It was perfect. They had an open mic night, so they had a bar in the front and they had stage in the, in the front and they had open Mike night. They would start at eight and go two o'clock in the fucking morning and no hacks. I'm telling you know, hacks and they would ostracize hacks, boot him out of the community. They're all artists. There was a lot of really good comics that came out of that. It's wild. And one club went under, this one club went under and the whole scene took a big hit. Apparently the scenes bouncing back now and there's, there's a lot more comics now in Houston, but dude, when I used to work there in the 90s you would go there and these opening acts, these guys who were working there would be fucking killers.

Speaker 2:          02:35:01       They were killed. Hers would rip. They were great. They were real comics. There were real comics and then the open Mike night you would see funny comics that were learning how to do comedy, like people that really have shot, but it was just one club. That's always a problem when there's one club in a town. Wendy's figured out how to do that in Denver, like that's what Wendy who owns the comedy works. She's figured out, she's created a scene like that. That scene is almost primarily responsible or she's almost primarily responsible or or or as one individual for that entire comedy scene. Yeah, she's amazing. Well she's called. I give her credit because I think she's cultivated such good talent that that again, that's kind of what you were saying about Houston. Like everyone that I know that I met there, that's from there. It comes out of there is, is a fucking phenomenal comedian.

Speaker 2:          02:35:49       Right? Like they're like they're locals are professionals here. To this day when I do comedy, like a do theaters, they're like, I'll do this. The Belko, it's like 5,000 seats. I go through her, I do it through her and I, she also do her club, so I always hang out with her when I'm in town. Like that lady's super important. Yeah. Like I did my special there in 2014 my comedy central special because I like, it was important to me to do it at that club. That club was one of the reasons why I moved to Colorado for a brief time. I was like, this, I'll be close to this club. It was like I can, I can survive here. Like I need a pay station. I need a base station to fuck around and workout material. I could use this place like everybody else is doing it.

Speaker 2:          02:36:29       Like I could, I could. This could be a, this is a real comedy community. It really is. Yeah. There's a few like that that are building so strong right now. I think my only fear for the future is there's a lot of new clubs that pop up and a lot of clubs that have gone so corporatized that they're all the same. Then I'm still a club guy. So for me, I don't get to play theaters, you know? So when you do clubs, you're, you know, at the mercy of the club system of whatever that may be, you know, and a lot of them are, a lot of them are so corporately systematic. I mean, you feel like, you're like, sometimes you feel like, you know the old joke of a musician psych, what's up Omaha? And they're like, what? This is no Mas Missouri? And you're like, well, it all feels the same. Like some of the clubs feel the same. That's true with a lot of the Improv's. But what they've done is they figured out a way to make it a very professional experience. Everywhere you go all over the country.

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       Yeah. Like I accept what they're doing because what they're doing is like a blend of the art and commerce. They've done a smart thing, but they don't fuck with your act. No. As long as they don't fuck with my act, I'm cool. And it's all, it was their professional and friendly. I'm cool. But there's a big difference between working for them and like working for [inaudible] in Nashville. It's like owned by, you know, guys have owned it for a long time. It's a super sweet club, you know, it just great guys. It's just, and it's a perfect old school. You know, it's an old school comedy club because you walk around and look at the headshot to go, is he, he's dead now. He killed himself. Then he died. How many dead people that are at a lot, man, a lot. That's like the comedy store is like a posture Miss Hallway when he walked into his, everybody on the world is dead.

Speaker 1:          02:37:58       It's true. Roseanne might be the only big picture in the hallway that's still alive. Well, there's one wall when you get out of the kitchen and you go towards the main road. If you took a right, yeah, that one wall three out of the four people are dead. Yeah. That's what I mean. Like it's like Rosangela one. That's a lie. That's on that side of the wall, I think. No, I think it's Louie Anderson. Oh yeah, you're right. No, you're right. You're right. You're only Anderson's alive. Robin Williams is dead. Surely. Hemphill's dead. Yup. Um, Richard Pryor's dead and Garry shandling's death. Shandling's Acessa shitty one. I, I'm held that she, she has a big picture. Is She on the wall? I think she's not a big picture as a smaller, smaller on the wall. Yeah, there's a lot of them, dude. Yeah, it's wild. Yeah. Early last Craig motherfucking Mac today.

Speaker 1:          02:38:44       All right. P Craig Mac flavor. New Year. You were the best. Um, where you get it. Where are you going to next? I'm finishing up shooting the second season of, I'm dying up here for showtime, so I'm here in town doing that once it started here. Are you happy with it? Everything's going well. Smooth. We added Brad Garrett who's on and who's crazy. Bread's good dude. He's great. Such a cool guy. He's a great guy. He's got the Best Club in Vegas. Yeah. And you know what's so funny, man, it's great to sit down and talk, talking stories about, stand up with him cause he's been around for so long. He knows.

So I love them now and raves about that place. Yeah, I know. They love him. They love him and, and, and they, they like, they like, they like a lot of store guys. It's just by coincidence. Like Bobby, they love a lot of funny comics. They're like funny people. Triple. He did his cd there. Yeah. Recorded there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great spot. Don. My rarer raves about that. Brad Garret Club at the MGM. Oh yeah. It's like, it's the best club we own. Dom Dom is on, I'm dying up here and this actually happened this last week. Uh, dom had a scene in the show where he like has a heart attack and uh, you know, he gets on a plane to go to Jersey or something.

Speaker 3:          02:40:53       He flans there's like six missed phone calls from Mark Marin and mark leaves and voicemails being like, hey man, I heard something happened on set. Cause you know, like the game of telephone got out that it was like someone said, yeah, that was done in a senior. He had a heart attack. So it was like, wait, what? Tom had a one on it and it just bled out into the ether, you know, so, so dom called me, he's like, Hey Andrew, I got to tell you people think I'm dead. Did you who told people that I died on set? And I'm like, I don't know man. Maybe it'll give you some traction. So let it keep going. Keep subtraction. Isn't that funny? Maybe it'll go viral. Fuck it. You never know bro. Dot. Viral. But Dom is the best man we've had. He's awesome. He's the best.

Speaker 3:          02:41:27       We've had some good comics pop up. We're going to keep there. They keep getting more cow. Andy kindler came on the show. Um, fucking Rick Overton is back on the show. There's like a lot of great, a lot of great people. I became friends with dom cause we, we hung out in a pool hall once. Okay. Yeah, we did a Gig together, but I didn't really know him. And then I went to Amsterdam billiards in New York and like 90 somewhere in the 90s and a, I used to play a lot of pool and I was there and Dama rare was there with his own stick. I was like, what do you play pool? He's like, yeah, he's pretty good. I was like, Shit, let's play some pool. And we played pool. It's like, I can't believe I fucking love him. Play some real pool. That's from Philadelphia.

Speaker 3:          02:42:04       From Philadelphia. You've gotta be able to take a punch to tell a joke and play some pool. That's it. You have to have the end know where the good cheese sticks are. Right, right, right. Do you think that's Philadelphia people like enough with the fucking chase day? No, they love it. It's part of their fucking culture. But you don't think they're annoyed like, oh, you're saying that. That's all we have. And partially it is. What are their food is coming out of there? Is anybody else being like, dude, you know what else is good out of Philly? Very good Italian food. They have been as good at, that's like Boston, good Italian food, New York. I think Boston has some of the best of talent. If we go to the north end, that's not true. Oh yeah. I have good Italian food that you can't fuck with New York.

Speaker 3:          02:42:37       I grew up there. Trust me. One of the same New York, Boston to me. No, you don't think he could fuck with it. Sorry. Boston. Like I love Ya. I love Ya. But I think there's a smaller amount of good places. Whereas New York, there's an endless supply per capita. It's fucking yes. Supply of flour on the floor and fucking people with aprons and making sure, oh fucking sauce. My own shot shade shed. It's just, uh, I feel like there's a larger concentration of guineas in like the New York, New Jersey area. And in Boston it was more of a concentration of Irish. There was more Irish,

Speaker 2:          02:43:12       Irish. Yeah, I was just a few Italian, but they were heavily out numbers like East Boston, you know, like a few places, little Italy, few places where I feel comfortable with it because I'm an orange guy. When I go to Boston, people think I'm more than just slipped right in. They assume I'm there. Well, what are you, Irish and Italian who was, hey, you're one of theirs. Yeah, but not one of their Sam Tino. They hear Santina Santina they get mad. What? We'll try to this. Yeah. When I first moved to Boston, I had an Irish last name, the opposite, but I'm mostly Italian. I'm three quarters Italian where you look it. So it's like, uh, like, Whoa, wait, you got fucking Irish last name and you're almost all Italian. Fucking shame. Fuck it. Fuck that. Shame. There's some real Irish versus Italian animosity in Boston and like the in most cities, late seventies early eighties when I first moved there, I was going to say like the history of Irish and Italian.

Speaker 2:          02:43:59       They didn't fuck, they didn't really get along too well. I did not think I moved there in, it must've been like 79 79 and then I went to high school there in 81 that was my first year in high school. Where were you born? I was born in New Jersey. I was gonna say I thought Jersey, but we lived in California for a while. I lived in California from age seven to 11 and then we lived in Florida for a little bit and then we lived in Boston and Jamaica plain for a year and a half, two years, somewhere in there. And then we moved to Newton, which is a very nice suburb. Upper falls for a nice, I was fancy. It's very quiet. There's a lot of big lawns. Everybody's relaxed fences. People born out of their fucking mind. Can't wait to escape, you know, it's one of those places.

Speaker 2:          02:44:40       Don't realize how good they have it. Well, that's what happens. I went back recently, I drove through the streets. I'm like, Jack could live here. It's fucking places. Great. Well, you have a new perspective. When you get older, when you're younger, you're like, get the fuck out of the shade hole. Well, when you're younger, you just so filled with angst. He just like, you have no idea. Like think about this. When you were 17 you had no idea you're going to be a professional comic. No idea. Things going to work out. You're going to be on a TV series, going to be having a good time. He had no idea. So he just like, Whoa, what if it doesn't? What if it all goes wrong? You see all these people around you and this guy's always drunk and he's doing coke. I got, he thought, fuck Outta here.

Speaker 2:          02:45:13       I gotta get the fuck out of this town. The fuck away from these people. And then you go back when you're an adult and you go, this is a great place. I grew up in a really nice town. It was probably only because when you leave it's nice to come back. Oh, I didn't have anybody telling me it was awesome. Five, like a smart older brother. They'd be like, Dude, look, here's the Catholic school. Girls are all horny. They're all right there. They just wait outside in front of the school. I would have had strategies, dude. There was no one that was hornier than the girls who went to Catholic school. No one. No one. Yeah, they separated those girls from boys and they were a different animal than the girls I went to school with freaks. Yeah. I went to public school. I went to Newton South and uh, when we were in high school we would get out and we would meet girls that were coming off of the Catholic girls school.

Speaker 2:          02:46:00       These girls would go after guys. They weren't like regular girls. Like it's hunger games. Predator. Like they were starving. They needed water. Dick, it was crazy. The horniest girl I ever dated when I was young, went to, was in an all girl Catholic school. She was a great gal who was a fuck machine cause she was like made a joke about her that like you could, you could roll a dick passed her like a kitten with a ball of yarn and she would just, she couldn't help it. She wasn't a bad person, but she was always horny and it took me years to figure out what was going on. It was something that I really considered in a very strange way. Okay. I had a, I, it really puzzled me because I had these preconceived notions about how women behave, but these Catholic school girls through a giant monkey wrench into this notion like, okay, that makes sense for the regular girls.

Speaker 2:          02:46:53       Regular girls, they might let you know. They think you're cute. He seems nice. You, you ask around, you ask a friend to ask her if she likes me. And you know, there was like this little thing, those Catholic girls, they would cut to the chase. They were like werewolves. They would just charge to the room and grab a guy, hey, how are you want to make out? Next thing you know, you're fingering them. They were crazy. It was, there were a totally different animal, your hand and putting it down their pants and girls didn't like it. Other girls, the regular girls did not like, they were like gang members. They're like gang members. They all had their own uniform. They come over with their fucking plaid skirts on and just fuck everything. Like the Tasmanian Devil. They would just tornado fucking the whole of the school and they prayed on these boys because they didn't have any, they had no boys.

Speaker 2:          02:47:36       They're in a whole school. The hundreds of girls when you were oppressed, that that's what you get, dude, that is not good. When you take away human emotion like that, you're fucked. All they're doing is just all day math, science, Spanish, Dik, dik, dik dik dik dik dik just run it to the ticker tape of Dixon. Just going through their head and Tj's and boners. It's Squirt, squirt, squirt. Just thinking about so on, sucking her titties and eating their box. That's all they're thinking about. That's all they thought about. I mean, I really like for that. For years. That girl fucked me up because I had all these ideas about like a spectrum of natural female sexuality, like this girl's Hornier than that girl, but this girl was wanting to do than that girl, and she really likes this, but she really likes that. But most of them, they act like girls.

Speaker 2:          02:48:19       You've got to let them know that not this bitch off the charts rabid. She was rabid, rabid. They suppress the shit out of her. They just left her in this fucking thing. It was crazy. Meanwhile, her sisters was really weird. Her sister didn't go to Catholic school. Her sister went to school with me. Should we do a regular school? She was normal. She was fucking normal. I mean, she was a, I mean, just nice girl and everything. Nothing wrong with her. Fun hang out with, but normal. She wasn't a werewolf. Yeah, nothing insane. Her sister was a werewolf. The Werewolf for Dick too. She was a monster and it was the only one in the family that was like that. And I just don't, I don't see any other correlation shiny this for years. She's probably in a fucking orgy. She's a fifth nine nine 80 getting stuck by like five [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          02:49:10       Two of them. She's German. She's face fucking him there. That she's an animal. Girls an animal. Is He? I said, well that's I gotta be with are a women that get into porn. Probably had some kind of repression like that. Right? That's the thing. It's more molestation. Yes, the most. It's the most, but it's not all of them. I, you know, there's a thing that they always want to say that all women who get into porn or fucked up, man, I, I know, I don't believe that. No. Yeah. And there's a thing that people was like, someone was saying the other day that porn addiction is real and porn is fucked up. Cause it ruins way guys think. And like maybe some guys. But isn't that the same as with gambling? Like isn't gambling really bad for some guys? Yeah. You know it is right? Yeah. It ruins people's lives.

Speaker 2:          02:49:51       Ruins their life. Yes. I think there's certain guys that just can't fucking gamble. Right. Who was it that was saying that he, his dad lost their house over gambling early podcast. God dammit, that growing up. Want to say it was one of Calvin's friends, was it Jimmy Burke? It might've been, I mean, I come from my grandfather's a microphone that works at the dog track in Chicago. I think it was Jimmy Burke chose whole life. Dad was a crazy gambler. But yeah man, there's a, I knew a lot of guys like that from the pool hall that had just every nickel they earned, they would below. They always owed money and they were hiding from people is always gambling that lifestyle. So wild. But I don't have a problem with gambling. So if I go to Vegas and uh, you know, I don't bet on anything, but if I, I used to bet on fights, so if I, maybe if I'm in Vegas and just for a fucking goof, Canelo Alvarez is going to fight.

Speaker 2:          02:50:42       Gennady Golovkin I get to the sport to book like a day before the fight and my cow put a fucking couple hundred bucks on this. I think triple g's got it. And A, and I'll throw my hat in the ring, but I'm not going to lose my mind and bet my life was with some people. It's their whole existence to have to, it doesn't mean that I shouldn't be able to go gamble. It's just like the same thing is if I'm in a hotel room and I want to jerk off, I don't want to hear your bullshit about somebody who's addicted to and it ruins their life. That's, I'm sad. I'm sad that someone got addicted to it and [inaudible] them, but as nothing that I can do about that in porn is a real thing. So what do you, what do you want me to do?

Speaker 2:          02:51:15       It was the same with alcohol is to abandoned all my jerking off and not watch the stuff that I want to watch because somewhere there's someone who can't handle it. Or do we have to like educate people? Hey, some people they have weak chins and they just, they don't think, well, you shouldn't get into boxing. Right. Okay. It says, you know what I mean? Like if you can't take a punch, don't get into boxing. If you just, if you watch one porn film and next thing you know, five hours later you're dehydrated. You know you haven't left the room, your legs don't work. Your fucking hands tired. You got tennis elbow like it's not my fault. Okay. I don't know what to tell you should I not jerk off now? But those people that suffer through, it's like people were alcoholics like, oh, what are you drinking?

Speaker 2:          02:51:58       You're drinking? Yeah. Yeah. I like to have a drink. You know why? Cause I'll go weeks without having one for it ruined my family doesn't fuck my life up. I like to have a drink. I don't go home and kick my fucking dog around the house and beat my kids. I like to have a drink. Is that all right? To have a glass of wine with dinner? Does that mean that I have to respect the guy who lost everything and he's fucking homeless and he's sucking dicks for cheap wine? Nope, because he couldn't handle it. So I should add of respect for him. Pushed that peanut on the wireless side. No, no, no. It's not a palate cleanser. When you're having a nice steak and some a fine garlic mashed potatoes, that's a terrible drug that ruins families. Right? Just like the porn. Just like fucking everything though. It's like working out. You can be addicted to working out so many people are. They are. There's a lot of people that are off.

Speaker 3:          02:52:43       Stop you from lifting. Come on, come on. People are too fucking Goddamn soft. That's the problem. We're so saw other people so much that we're ruining them and we're ruining them. We were ruining people. God dammit. Santina know. How did we get to this? Maybe it doesn't know. He's looking at porn like he mad. He does. He looks at porn all the time. I see it in his eyes like you see the glint glimmer, what was going on? Let me see what's going on. Yeah. Watching porn is one of the weirdest taboos because you think about how many people watch it.

Speaker 2:          02:53:25       I mean it is. I the last that didn't we talk about this once, but it was something insane. Like 20% of all Internet

Speaker 3:          02:53:31       traffic is all one word. I thought it was more than that. More when you asserting 39% I'm gonna say 39 I'm going to say, I'd say I'm going to do 42 isn't most of it Netflix now? 30% 30% what percent is Netflix? 70 I want to say 49 I don't know why I'm in the ninth today. I'm going to say 36 Ooh, this is like a, the price is right. You got 37 yelled it. Damn some knuckles stupid. Went to five and just North America, but 36 of all. Wow. Do you got super specific? Wait, wait, 32.25 in just North America. 36 overall. So, but that was October 8th of 2015 so it's got to be more now probably been, how crazy is that? That the United States has that big of a market and the rest of the world is just four or five points. I'll tell you why that's wrong because uh, Ian Edwards was just somewhere that was saying how the international market now has almost matched and Ian's working on a Netflix show and their international markets almost mashed in North America.

Speaker 3:          02:54:31       Now. That was what, three years ago? It's got to be way higher now. That's crazy. Way Higher. That is crazy. You know they made in the, in the fourth quarter last year, Netflix, take a guests, don't look it up and take a guess. 80 kazillion dollars. No, no, no. And just the fourth quarter last year they made 3.4 billion and just the fourth court. 10 for the year. That's probably right. Wow. Well death thrown it around at comics. I'll tell you that. I wish they were thrown into me. They will be santeen and first of all, you would have been a little too white and the future is dark. I know the future's Brown and Meek.

Speaker 2:          02:55:04       If you had glasses and you were thin and Brown, you'd have a show. I'd have two shows. If you were a woman and you had glasses. Yeah. And you were Brown. I might, I might transform. No, I think that what it is right now is that they just have so many specialists that they're working on. That's my biggest problem was trying to say that they be like, oh, you know, they're only going after, I forget what term he used, like either hipsters or they're going after a, you know, diversity and like they're not, they're not going to give it to a white guy. I'm like, John Malaney just got a special, yeah, we talking about like this, Craig Ferguson just got it special.

Speaker 3:          02:55:39       It's just those that have built it. You have to build yourself. You have to be built. Well, that's how it always was. Yeah, of course

Speaker 2:          02:55:45       the way it always used to be, and this is the problem is there's no real valid entry level show. So what it used to be is you would get on like young comedian special on hbo and then there would be like four of Ya. Everybody would do 15 minutes or so and then that's how you'd make it. Right. And then there was the Rodney dangerfield specials and that's how we found out about Lenny Clarke and dom Irrera, right. Bill Hicks, Sam Kinison, dice clay, they all came out of the Rodney dangerfield specials. There's not a thing like that anymore. So you got to go through those things before he got a special, it's wild. Now it's like you just kinda get specials,

Speaker 3:          02:56:23       right. You have to find a way into the game. You have to find, you have to find like the niche that gets you to the place to get the special. Will you have a showtime special? I do hepatis special up on showtime last year, but the problem is showtimes market is so, you know, so specific. It's only people that subscribed. Meanwhile, Netflix is fucking everybody. That's true. But meanwhile Sebastian became of the biggest comics in the world because it's just cause a showtime. Yeah, no, Sebastian is the Unicorn man. Like when people go, well, how did he make it so big? Well first of all, he's really funny, very funny, great guy, family friendly and for whatever reason he, whatever show times fucking target market is clear. He just flew right through it. He was like, there's an opening and he just like, oh shit, I'll touching the wall.

Speaker 3:          02:57:10       He just went right through. Right. It's perfect. Perfect. Yeah, but that's what all that is. That's all perfect timing and I, you know, yeah, I mean showtimes bigger. I don't know if I would do another one anytime soon at all, but if they did, if I did do another one, I do it with them. You know, I don't really care where it is. I, I just care the content that I put on it and someone see it online, can they go and get that show time? That's the biggest, that's the problem. See, that's the thing about Netflix that's so great is everybody has it, but showtime is like my specialist always there. It's just you have to have showtime. We've

Speaker 2:          02:57:37       talked about doing this with podcasts about doing the same kind of thing, like coming up with a bunch of cash and have an all podcasts under one umbrella. Right. You know, w like a Netflix type deal because everybody has their own way of doing it now. Like everybody has their own way of doing it in terms of like, some people have ads, some people have like a go fund me or Patrion page.

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       But that would fuck, yeah. Would fuck you up, right? Probably. Yeah. I mean that would, that seems like, unless it was like a netflix thing where everybody had it. It's, that would have to be the thing. Yeah. But what do you like Netflix is movies and movies. Take a shit load of money to make Netflix is TV shows. They take a shitload of money to make this podcast. You could have done it on a phone. We could have set our iphone on the table right there. Press the auto record thing and just gone. Yeah. But instead we've got Jamie doing all these fake button pushing and pr bro and fun flat cap. Apple's market cap. That's why me and Marcus Brown market cap is closing in on $1 trillion. He had got $1 trillion. You could literally buy every single NFL, NBA and mls team for NASA and a hundred thousand teslas and still have money leftover. But you couldn't buy apple. Whoa.

Speaker 1:          02:58:56       Uh, by Netflix seven and a half times. Wow. But apple is that what they're doing with podcasts is very interesting because they just, they're just an aggregator. You know, like you have to have your own host and you just put it up on there and, but through their itunes, I mean we're always in this trending section and we're always in like, um, like the rankings when you're looking at like who the top podcasts are, we're always in there and that helps people find you totally. So they're helping people find you. They are kind of a network in a way, but they're not a network in a way. Like they're not like a youtube where they control content and not like they're not, they're not really, they're not hosting you. Well they have apple music too, but podcasts are part of that. I wonder if they, to do that so weird that they don't merge those like that that podcast is a separate tab, which makes no fucking sense to me.

Speaker 1:          02:59:49       Like it's just to be a sub category of music. It should be. Right. But then there's a thing of if you have something on itunes, right, and like apple music, is it totally different jam, right. Like apple music is them hosting it, isn't it? They would have. It would have your podcast. So if you said something really fucked up, like maybe they would get in trouble for having you on. I don't think so. Think they won't sponsor someone song. No. Yeah, same way. Same thing. Like any like radical punk rock fucking crazy to my fucking mother host it. Right. Going into it. But I mean I don't think but like look up like, but apple music can't like what does a spotify market versus the apple music market? Like? I don't think apple music has does well at all. I think she's doing way better now, but not as well as spotify does.

Speaker 1:          03:00:38       Cause I feel like spotify just dominates the mark. Yeah. But see, apple music's on everyone's phone now and you just find it and use it. It's so easy to use. You don't use spotify. See, but I think it's the, the youngest generation loves spotify. Like they love soundcloud. Soundcloud. Yeah. So big. They loved they soundcloud. A lot of people were using the host podcasts. Yeah, totally. But a lot of people think that it won't be around. Oh, I think that's the opposite. Yeah. Not only do I think, not only is it for stuff like that, that's homemade podcast stuff like diy, it's also set to surpass spotify page paid subscribers. Right, right. Cause spotify starts off for free. Right, right. Interesting. Um, but like that's my thing is like, uh, you know, like that the future of soundcloud thing like that is because it's, it's all, everybody loves diy shit.

Speaker 1:          03:01:22       Whether it's musicians or like all those musicians and artists now that are on spotify, it's all people like making music in their fucking, in their house. Fucking youtube, you know? I mean, how many youtube millionaires have been made from a lot, so many weird shit. Putting up videos, talking. I know some from the, I know some from the beginning, like I used to do a youtube sketch thing a long time ago and like caught fire a little bit on a fairly small scale and the people that we kind of associated with when it was starting to grow, two or three of them now that I know have made so much money from that and they were just from the jump, they were kind of like in right as the cusp was like beginning. You know what happens with that dude who got in trouble with the suicide?

Speaker 1:          03:02:00       Is that Jager? Logan Paul. Which one is he? Logan. Paul Logan. Paul. He's, he's banned. They don't, they demonetize his entire channel and I thought he's still making videos. Right? He's not making any money. They took all his ad money away because he electrocuted a dead rat. No. Yes. He did a video yesterday at two and a half. A million views. So, but he doesn't get paid? No, there were saying that it's, his entire channel was demonetized unless he got lawyers involved. So then he could be just using his channel and then getting sponsored videos and merge, which is one of the big things to me, it's stunning. Makes more unmerge probably then it doesn't from fucking youtube probably does it. To me it's stunning that there is not a competitor to Youtube, not a real competitor. Yeah, there's been tried. They've tried. It's crazy. Vimeo is just not, not happening.

Speaker 1:          03:02:48       Well it's a video hosting site, but it's not, it's not as user friendly. Well it's also, it doesn't suggest things. Their algorithm that youtube was totaled out to having what's next on the right hand side, it's like so attractive because there's always something there to click on Vimeo does.is that they're not as sophisticated in that way. They want to be the artistic, uh, you know, culture. They want to cultivate like the sexy little artistic thing. Youtube is like, fuck it. Here's everything we've, you've ever wanted to see. And ads for Tampons, we had, um, W W we're putting up every video on Vimeo as well as on Youtube, but on youtube it'll have over a million videos, a million hits. And then you go to Vimeo and the same video we'll have like what, 20, 30,000, 20,000. Yeah, that's, I was gonna say, cause there, there was so sick, their viewer traffic is so much lower. It's so much lower. The only time I watch vimeo is when someone sends me an email link. And you got to think that video link is being sent to whatever million people I have on twitter. Totally. I have like 2 million people in 2 million Russian bots.

Speaker 1:          03:03:48       I'm not sure which one. They're all bought suits. I don't, I don't know how that works. I think in a bought, some of them they say it's if you haven't used it to post, but there's a lot of people that use twitter and they don't post. So like how do you know if someone's a Bot, like there's some suspicion of their, um, their detection methods to decide who's, he always can tell when you look at their fucking profile, the stuff they write is so funny. Oh, there's definitely some of those, you know, I get a lot of those on instagram. Get a lot of those really. Yay. A weird like fake comments. You know, like a, I learned how to make $109 a week all over the place. Those things are everywhere, you know, it's uh, it's like, who are they getting with that? Like, who are they?

Speaker 1:          03:04:28       Who are they going after? Literally nobody. Yeah. Nobody, they can't make any money. That's gotta be just like a whole soul people. They'll get some man. Really, man, I watched the saddest show once with this old dude kept getting, he kept getting scammed by this Nigerian scammer who's pretended he was a hot girl that wanted to meet him in Europe. This poor fuck flew to Europe twice to meet this girl. And both times she came up with excuses why she couldn't meet him, but for some, but, but you know, like dude, Darwinism dude. Well, yeah, I think has shown an idiot. Can you feel bad for that guy? He was this older guy and his, his daughter and uh, everybody died and no, they were alive, but they were sad. They were watching this poor guy get fucking scammed and keep traveling to Europe, and he didn't want to believe the girl didn't exist and you were watching it and like everyone knew, but him like you knew I watched him like, no, that's why I can't feel bad.

Speaker 1:          03:05:15       Did that God let him live that fantasy. Then life is just a fantasy. It's fantasy. Let him live that sad fantasy. Al De Nova. Tada. I watched the video that the other day. We're at the store, uh, we were in the secret comic bar. We started talking about Aldo Nova. I'm like, do you remember that song? And I put it up on Youtube. We're sitting there like laughing, watching some video. Yeah. I miss the old videos, man. The beginning of it. Nova uses guitar to break into a building and then he performs on stage. This is the beginning of it. You could play at the beginning of it because it's not music. No, no. We can't. We'll get booted off youtube, but it's a fucking ridiculous music videos. A bunch of dudes and machine guns. They opened up this helicopter lands and fucking Aldo Nova steps out. He's got a leopard outfit, is sleeves are rolled up.

Speaker 1:          03:06:06       He's got knee high boots on and he doesn't make eye contact with anybody. Walks to the fucking state. You can see your eyes back to the door. It looks he's got a purpose in his walk. They get to the door, but he can't get in because the door is locked. Shit to trying to get in. Fuck can't get in. Step back. I'll though says he tries to break it with his gun, but he's weak ass bitch, bitch. That's where it seems almost like qb. The guitar music is the key. Puts the strap on. Check this out, man. Down. How Dow melts off the fucking lock with his guitar. Bitch kicks open the door. The fucking smoke machine starts going. They all walk in and the bands already ready. Come on baby. Yeah, that was it. This is a timestamp. This is what happens when you take lsd and marijuana out of the market. As soon as you make it illegal really bad and make these fucking people terrified for their lives. No one does drugs and everybody just falls into this kind of shitty music. It's that what they're doing, man. I don't know what they're doing. They literally like children. They like been separated from the umbilical cord. They don't know how to get nutrition. They're flying around freaking the fuck out. What is this? Where am I?

Speaker 8:          03:07:22       It's just a fantasy. Can you let us time to sit? Lie. This is such a terrible song.

Speaker 1:          03:07:30       When I was in high school, it was the shit, man. Everybody's backside. That's a terrible fucking song. Now you do. Yeah, but back then, you know, it's like def leppard. Sing and pour some sugar on me. Fantasy. All right, I gotta wrap this up. Um, Andrew Santinello tells these wonderful people.
