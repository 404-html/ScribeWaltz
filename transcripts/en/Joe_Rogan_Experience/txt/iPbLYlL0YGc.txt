Speaker 1:          00:01          Hello Freak bitches,

Speaker 2:          00:03          and and the thing is there's this illusion of stability. There's the solution that because the system is so big, it can't possibly be for your child, but the truth is exactly the opposite. It has become incredibly fragile. It is extremely overextended and extremely fragile, and you see the, the Federal Reserve at the moment has been pumping money into the economy like crazy for five years and as they do that, you get diminishing returns, so every here they put the same amount of money in and they, they move the economy, they moved the stock market a bit less and then they put more money in and it moves a bit lesson until they're putting money in just to keep it stable. Now I've seen that pattern before. I mean that looks like a cocaine habit right in the first year, right? The coke addict is snorting a lot of free Federal Reserve money and the stock market's getting really high. Indeed's bye bye. Here. Five it takes. It takes a big fat line of Federal Reserve money just just to keep the stock market from crashing in the morning. And then one day which happened in mid October, the Federal Reserve turned off the tap a month ago. Federal Reserve stopped giving out free money to the banks. We haven't seen the effect that will have in the stock market, but if you follow your cocaine addict analysis right now, that addict is Jonesing for a hit and is really, really cranky. Some bad things could happen.

Speaker 1:          01:35          But yeah, there are about seven to eight months away from sucking trucker dicks. And that's really what's going on. I mean, there are about. They're about that far away. There's a lot of people like super pumped up to start a revolution. They're walking into trader Joe's, clapping their hands saying, you can't stop the revolution. Have you seen this? It's fucking videos of these morons. And it's usually like menopausal women dudes with aimless shiftless minds. You know, people that there's something wrong with them. They're out there walking through supermarkets yelling at people, people just trying. And you can't stop the revolution. It's like, what revolution is this? The revolution that interrupts shopping with shitty singing revolution

Speaker 3:          02:18          can have affordable yogurt and fresh fruits,

Speaker 1:          02:20          privileges. It's this thing of doing nothing but making a lot of energy and sound by doing it. Like I get that you're upset about police brutality. I get that you're upset about the way this country's going. I get the. But going through trader Joe's, clapping your hands is in fixing a fucking thing because just going to alienate people to whatever dumb idea you have.

Speaker 3:          02:42          Yeah. Uh, there was a woman in Venice beach who came up to me recently and asked me to sign our petition to run for president. She's gonna run. Yeah. I was Kinda like, well, don't you maybe you want to start with like a youtube channel or something like, who the fuck are you, you know, you can't just leap right to president. And she had a few signatures and was so serious about it. And I was like, well, what's the platform? And she's like, we're going to eliminate homelessness in Venice beach. And I was thinking like, that's not really a national platform, you know, you're gonna become president and be like, we have to address the five homeless people right here. So, um, my point though is I think that people think that they have to change something and they have to do something because they can see all the problems around them. And for some people that's let's go to a protest or let's, let's run for office or let's, you know, let's just start a petition no matter how ridiculous it sounds. And the sad reality is revolution is silent nowadays. Like the people who are online buying bitcoin and developing these other coins are creating more of a revolution than anybody in the trader Joe's on a Tuesday.

Speaker 1:          03:43          But I feel like that's the type of shit that like when you almost start dressing like a chick, like you actually get more pussy, like more women coming in. Like that rock star thing that in, in this fucking lucky you start borrowing their clothes and next ain't no, they're blowing you. Once I heard it went well. What's really funny is that an hit parade is pretty. Like Judas priest started a lot of the metal stuff. Rob Halford, snm dressing, snam dressing and people didn't realize he was gay as fuck right here. I had no idea rob hoffer was gay as fuck, and he got all these guys to essentially dress like gay s and m guys. Yeah. That was what became the look is brilliant, but that's so much of a bad motherfucker. He is. He made one of the great front man and then nothing too he.

Speaker 1:          04:27          He basically was completely 100 percent other than Freddie mercury who was literally in a band called Queen at. We're just so dumb, like, no, he's fine. He's straight. He seems good. That's all. Don't be homophobic like it matters. Yeah. To tie to mercury. I made that fucking guy that, that live aid set is one of the. I would put that up against anybody's performance ever. Well, who's a bad motherfucker? He turned Wembley Stadium into a fucking coffee house. He had them. Everybody like the fucking back row [inaudible]. That guy was unbelievable. Yeah, he was sensational. He was a really unique talent. Like there was no one like him before because he was such a combination of like masculinity and femininity and I never noticed any of that. I was just like, this fucking guy. He can't stop watching them, but his, his, his, his, uh, his singing was credible and he was a better, live as good as the albums where he's one of the few guys that was actually fucking better live.

Speaker 1:          05:33          Wow. I haven't seen anybody come close to that guy. Wow. Since, wow. That's a strong bill. Burr. Anybody. You got anybody that could fuck fucking hold 100,000 people in the palm of his hand after he had to follow all those other base. You know, it's true. You have to go on after Robert Plant Jimmy page. That one didn't go well. That was what. That was one of the ones that didn't go out, which is why 2007 went so well because they were like, we can't do that again. They put it together the last fucking second. And then he had bad. They had to dramas at the saint. Can you please whisper in my ear during my accident?
