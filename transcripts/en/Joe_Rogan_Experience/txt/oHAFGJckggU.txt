Speaker 1:          00:10          to give a shout out to one guy who I met, he's a guy named Matt Ruskin, right? And he was in the marines in Iraq and they had these five clubs in, in Iraq. And they would do the marine for like forest week on these, these were tough motherfuckers. And he was doing this, uh, they'd had these bike clubs and they would fight them the fuck out of each other. And he, he's like 200 pounds. And he would fight guys who were two 50. He would fight guys or one 50. He was fighting, he would beat them all. And he came back and he started doing MMA. He started finding him and me and he hooked up with this guy, one of the Gracies and, and you're taught him Brazilian Jujitsu, of which he was I believe, five time world champion. Uh, the Gracie, which guy? I'm forgetting his fucking name.

I'm going to get in shit for forgetting his name. That's okay. Thinking about it first. He's a real good looking guy. He was a model. Real good looking guy. Hickson Hickson is the most handsome of all time and the greatest of all. This guy was actually a model in Brazil. I'm not gay. And Matt Ruskin, if you can, if you can tweet me.

We are now in a swamp of disinformation. No, it's true. No wick PDA. And if someone can tweet us right now, problem, we don't have a great Matt, how are you?

Speaker 3:          02:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:07          I'm here with Joe Rogan. We're talking about the Gracies. Let me talk to this and I'm saying, who's the Gracie? Daniel. Gracie. Well, Daniel Daniel Gracie world. Uget you champion how many times? Three times.

Speaker 4:          02:37          What's going on in, how's everything?

Speaker 1:          02:38          Can you hear it? Yeah. Uh, what's up Matt w. W. W how do you know powerful? Shane Smith from vice.com

Speaker 4:          02:48          shaved Smith walked into a fucking work and they told him he needed to lose weight if you were going to die.

Speaker 2:          02:57          How rude. Because first of how rude,

Speaker 5:          03:00          how bout how bout, hey, settle down. First of all, how about you tell him first and foremost that you love them. You don't have to go right into the meat. You're, you're a fat fuck and you're going to die. He knows how much you love him. You say that, but is that touch alleviate the pressure of your own personal oh, no. Gay stuff. This is a late night podcasts. Misses a lot of dudes and elicited this in the shower. I'm sorry. Keep going

Speaker 3:          03:26          Matt.

Speaker 5:          03:30          No gay stuff, Bro. This is late night.

Speaker 4:          03:38          I did some work with midwives before, before five land. They did this whole thing of me when I was training for one of my fights. Uh, they said their friend Thomas around with me for a while. Um,

Speaker 5:          03:52          tell him about when we went down with Daniel Gracie. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          03:56          Uh, Jordan to a weapons bizarre with them.

Speaker 5:          04:00          Daniel Gracie.

Speaker 4:          04:03          Yeah. With Daniel.

Speaker 5:          04:05          Here's the thing about Daniel Gracie. Daniel Gracie is a very, very, very talented Brazilian Jujitsu fighter. But his real last name I don't believe was initially Gracie. I think he sort of,

Speaker 4:          04:18          and those cousins,

Speaker 5:          04:20          his hands, his cousin. Yeah. And I think his, his, his mom's name is Gracie, but his dad's name and his birth name was not Gracie. Right?

Speaker 5:          04:31          Yeah. I believe this is what I believe. I believe he's a very talented fighter, but I believe this whole idea of connecting yourself to the word Gracie is it is ultimately very self defeating and when a guy does that, I almost want to pull them aside. If the look Daniel, you're a bad motherfucker or whatever the fuck your last name is, it doesn't matter. You know you need to get your head wrapped around the fact that that's all bullshit. Gracie is a great name but it's 2013 and when he was competing eight, nine, 10 whatever the fuck it was, 2000 it doesn't matter what matters is how good you are and adopting the name. Gracie almost makes people think like, oh well this guy is trying to get a little extra attention for for no reason. The the, the, the world championships or the world championships and you either mounted guy who take us back, you tap him, whatever you do, you either do or you don't do and it doesn't matter if your name is Marcello Garcia who's unbelievably respected. I mean Marcel Garcia is the top of the pyramid when it comes to Brazilian Jujitsu. In the world today in 2013 or Gracie, it doesn't matter. So whatever his name was, what was his real name?

Speaker 5:          05:53          Matt. How many times you've been hiding in your life? Don't lie to me many times. What have you been hiding your life?

Speaker 3:          06:00          Yeah,

Speaker 5:          06:00          more than 10 is it more than 10

Speaker 3:          06:04          okay.

Speaker 5:          06:04          Yes. Okay, so we could probably go camping together. How many times do you eat and pot brownies and thought about chicks you fingered when you were 14? You were really upset like Kyra. Gracie more than 10. That's why I love talking to you, Matt. Let's keep it together, Matt. But there was a few guys that did that. Uh, the Gracie thing where they use,

Speaker 1:          06:27          what I'm going to say is Daniel Gracie's, whatever you want to go, what am I going to say? He's a bad motherfucker, but oh, by the way, he took us around Brazil. He took us to the valley. Tudo Jim's. He took us to the gyms. He took us with Matt and I got to say it was fucking, I got to say, you see a different level of shit down there. Then you'll see anywhere else they did. These guys trained like motherfuckers

Speaker 5:          06:49          to hear this mat and do you agree with this?

Speaker 4:          07:01          At the time was like the worst of the worst and we had to go ask the boss if we could come in here and tell the boss you're here, no problem. Just don't film the kids with the guns. And we're looking around, we're like what kids, what guns? We take a call like a left turn down the street

Speaker 3:          07:21          and

Speaker 4:          07:22          I mean it was just wall to wall. 14 year olds, 15 year olds with like military grade weapons. I mean you got to picture the, it was like one word, shorts, flip flops, you know like a 1989 Luther Campbell like gold road chamber to medallion, you know, mouth them, mouth of the side to side mount gold teeth, fucking you know, collapsible stock and forwarded a cod grenade launcher the whole nine. I mean these kids were armed to the fucking teeth

Speaker 3:          07:52          and

Speaker 4:          07:53          every one that we went down there with was just looking around like holy shit.

Speaker 5:          08:05          You can never end a story by saying like, Holy Shit, I am a very good story. I was with Matt. However you leave us can say this. I was, I was with Matt was there was 14 year old kids.

Speaker 4:          08:29          Like I said, like, you know, one of the 11 times,

Speaker 5:          08:32          don't lie to me, Matt say yes,

Speaker 4:          08:36          yes.

Speaker 5:          08:37          Okay, listen Bro, I feel what you're saying. And I was only fucking around. I was filling some dead space where we're trying to recalibrate our reality duty, your circumstances and your story being paradigm shifting. I'm not that fucked up. Listen, I want to tell you Matt,

Speaker 1:          08:56          man, I'm giving you a shout out. I love you. This guy fucking is an awesome guy. Ex Marine and a fighter. I love you Matt.

Speaker 5:          09:04          Matt, I'm very sorry. They got dragged into a podcast. It was just a phone call for you and all the sudden Shane Swiss talking about some crazy shit and you're like, God dammit. I got to tell the truth cause I'm Matt. But, but, but then you had Ruskin and I don't give a fuck.

Speaker 1:          09:23          But Daniel Gracie is a bad ass mother fucker.

Speaker 5:          09:25          Yes, unquestionably, but was his real name Matt

Speaker 3:          09:29          would that

Speaker 5:          09:31          Daniel Gracie, what is his real name?

Speaker 3:          09:33          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          09:34          Hi. The last name, the family name is Ozzy era. There were similar as one of the two. I know. I know.

Speaker 5:          09:38          And I completely, by the way, I want to let everybody know is no judgment involved in that whatsoever. I completely understand why someone who especially was in a situation where there were a very talented guy and they were trying to maximize the, the sort of the, this red of their name as far as possible and the word Gracie because of hoists and because of Horian and what they would they accomplished in UFC one. It was one of the most important moments in the history of martial arts. Would you agree, Matt?

Speaker 4:          10:13          I agree

Speaker 5:          10:14          it's, it's for people who don't know the history of it or weren't there when it's happening as martial artists, it was one of the most important moments ever. It's like all of a sudden we found out what really works. Right,

Speaker 3:          10:28          right.

Speaker 5:          10:29          And those guys, that name, that Gracie name, that shit's like cue tips or Kleenex, you know, it's anonymous. I don't give a fuck about your tissues. If you have tissues made by Kraft macaroni and cheese, if they're right next to clean x, I'm taking the Kleenex. Okay. Cause they dominate as does the NFL. They dominate as well. You know what I'm saying? Matt? Jesus Christ back me up.

Speaker 4:          11:00          I got to tell you. I think the name Angela,

Speaker 5:          11:04          100% thank you Matt. Thank you. In what way? Like Daniel, Daniel was a

Speaker 4:          11:12          all was fighting a bride. They told them to take, take the family name.

Speaker 5:          11:16          You know why do you know why

Speaker 4:          11:18          they were all fighting it?

Speaker 5:          11:19          Do you know why?

Speaker 3:          11:21          Yeah,

Speaker 5:          11:22          cause they're smart mother fuckers because they're smart motherfuckers and they know how to make that paper son.

Speaker 3:          11:30          Hmm.

Speaker 4:          11:32          Okay.

Speaker 5:          11:32          Hi Matt. Don't don't freeze up on me. Now we're in the deep end of the pool. Matt, we're not close to the lip hanging there. Did you see the right math teacher? Heather, are you with me buddy? I'm sorry. Listen, Matt, I need to apologize to you as a human. You didn't know what the fuck was going on here. You get dragged into this conversation.

Speaker 5:          12:46          I just think she had a, I could be have been there when Hendo and all those other guys are trying to talk Daniel into using the last name. Gracie. Oh, so let's think this shit through side federally. Silva did pretty good. What's the name? Silva. Okay. Okay. We're going to be fine. We don't need, Gracie was okay. Are you crazy? That's your name. Hanzo. Hey, Dez hens, or do you support this? Daniel character. Yeah. What did the fuck difference does it make? What noise you make with your mouth that represents his last name? Are we cool? Jesus Christ for the greater good of humanity, the world. How about we forget about imperial dictatorships and names that dominate sports history. If you feel me, Matt,
