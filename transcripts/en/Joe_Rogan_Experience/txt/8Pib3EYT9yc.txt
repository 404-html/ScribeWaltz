If you've never worked out with kettlebells before, don't get crazy and meathead, you really don't need anything more than a 35 pound kettle bell for the first time.

Speaker 1:          01:28          And you're like, Joe, you don't even know me. You don't even know how swole I am. 35 pounds. The fuck am I going to do with that? For Real, there's a, there's a video that I use called extreme kettlebell cardio workouts@dragondoor.com. It's incredible. 15. Yes, I just start out with a 10. You can do whatever the fuck you want. I started off with the cat or you can go crazy and prove me wrong and use a 50 if you're a fucking savage. But my point is it's not, uh, it's incredible workout. Great for you, and it's great for functional strength. You know, moving things, picking things up. Your whole body will work as one unit. That is what kettlebells are designed for. All right. You know what the fuck I'm talking about. Let's get the thing ruin. Hit the hit the music. Brian, let's start this thing.

Speaker 2:          02:10          Which town?

Speaker 1:          02:10          Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:12          Hey, Joe Rogan podcast. We're joined today by the world's coolest wine maker.

Speaker 1:          02:20          What's up brother? I their first because I've never actually met Brian. Some kind of, yeah, he's a weird motherfucker. Trust me. Kind of make me nervous, so I'm just going to get and make you more nervous. As time goes on. As he's looking at me, he's going to have a few comments that are just getting my God dude, just looking at me. Look right at me. He does. He does. Look at people. It's, he doesn't know the effect it has on folks. How the fuck do you go from being a rock star to being a rock star slash wine maker? What was the, it was just a whim. Did you have this idea? I think the biggest, the biggest hurdle there you have to get over is it, I don't think I've ever really been a rock. I've actually dabbled in the rock star stuff,

Speaker 3:          03:01          you know, um, Allah American psycho. But uh, for the most part it was just kind of me putting it on. I've always kind of been a small town kid, uh, working in the garden.

Speaker 1:          03:12          So you think of yourself as just a human being who likes to do things that are interesting and this is what's interesting to you.

Speaker 3:          03:18          You know, I've done things over the years and just get, get inspired and do more things and then all sudden accidentally over along the way somewhere you, you make a few dollars on something and I just go home, great. Then I can do more stuff.

Speaker 1:          03:31          But even the way you did this is so uniquely you, you know, you didn't, you didn't do it in Sonoma county. You didn't take an established orchard orchard rather than in it, you know, and take over it. You know, you went to a weird place, you went to fucking Arizona. You know, people think of Arizona, you think of kidnappings and in Mexico, and you know, that's the thing. You don't think of Nice tea. Yeah. You don't think of wine vineyards. Uh, well, a historic

Speaker 3:          03:56          glee, almost, almost every state that could actually sustain grapes, uh, vinifera. So European grapes, almost every state had vineyards and Haley and prohibition just threw a wrench, stuck, told him monkey wrench in that. And we can go down the whole conspiracy theory regarding, uh,

Speaker 1:          04:14          prohibition. Oh yeah. Well, it's a beautiful one. Yeah. It's real. It's still working today with marijuana. Yeah. And same, same people. Right. So it's,

Speaker 3:          04:23          so that pretty much what that did is it just interrupted our appreciation for what

Speaker 1:          04:27          wine, uh, as a, as a daily part in Europe. And that's why European wines became so much more popular than American wines. Right. You know, but they have, they have

Speaker 3:          04:36          some places in Europe have had thousands of years to develop what's going on on there, on that particular spot. They've had like just decades and centuries of notes, uh, whether on the terrain, on the results, on the process. So they're so far ahead of us in terms of just understanding those things and it's part of their culture.

Speaker 1:          04:56          It's the ground and the soil and what minerals and story with people who have not had any experience with farming might not know, but they vary wildly from place to place. How do you find the right spot if it hasn't had a vineyard there before? Or do you just say, this is a good spot? Let's you know,

Speaker 3:          05:14          you, you join the military, you get out of the military, you form a band,

Speaker 1:          05:21          take $1 million, you go dump that million dollars into a fucking black hole in the middle of nowhere and then go, well that was the wrong hole and you move over here and you're digging another hole. How many times did you do? Oh God. Oh, she did a few, well, there's a couple of sites. It's just our working what we've tried. So it's basically it to like, um, get a printer. They can actually print money that looks real and uh, make sure you keep changing the cartridges. So did you have to buy new land [inaudible] no, you end up, well, I mean you just have to pick the right variety for that spot. So if you're pretty, if you have

Speaker 3:          05:58          a pretty good idea that an area consisting good grapes there that are going to make, you know, uh, the kind of wine you want to drink, um, then it's a matter of figuring out what varietals going to work best there. I mean, we're not trying to grow, we're not trying to grow wine and grow grapes in, in Alaska. That's going to be hard. You're going to have to really hard pressed to find the right volume that Alicia grow their, uh, you know, we have Canadian ice wine. You have like a lot of the American hybrids to like vet all Blanca and Norton and knows kind of grapes that will grow in that extreme cold temperatures. Uh, not a lot of daylight. Um, it's, it really ripe in the Vinifera. But in our area we have everything is that everything's there, everything's set up. So it's just a matter of finding in that particular location that you dumped all your money into this land.

Speaker 3:          06:45          Like it figured out what grows there and it's not going to be, it's probably not going to be what you think is going to grow. There's going to be something else and it's going to take a lot of trial and error and you know, $40,000 an acre to find out. So you have to try different grapes and then go through a full season and then test the results. Well, you know, it's, it's more like a, it's more like just looking at the soil and uh, and that and that particular terrain and where it is and how it's oriented north, south, east, west and then try to pick the right grape for that site before you put anything on the ground, figure out what great might work there. Now this is a natural resource process for you. Is it something that you knew about already? Because you were interested in it or did you have to learn all this as you went along and had to learn?

Speaker 3:          07:27          I learned the hard way. So you know when you put the vine in the ground you don't know for, well you might, if it comes, you know, if it sticks around the next year within, you know you're at least you've got that part, then you know I'd actually grew, then you've got to figure it up. It's going to get the point where you can actually train it to start, you know, setting fruit on it. So you're not going to see fruit on that vine. You can probably push it and get some fruit on there the third year. But if you really want quality fruit and want to just let the plant really sinking, find its way, get the root system to get the whole structure of it a happy and healthy and then set fruit on it on the fourth year. And then you make the wine out of that fruit in the fourth year and then get to try it like in its fifth year.

Speaker 3:          08:07          So five years down the road after having planted those vines, you go, well, that wine sucks. Oh Man, what the fuck? Yeah. And there's no other way you can do that. There's no other like high tech DNA. It's not necessarily determine lens, right? Yeah. If you have, if you have, like if you're in California, in Napa Valley and you've got a vineyard over here and a vineyard over there, chances are the vineyard right here in the middle is probably going to do okay. Then you'll know what to grow by, what everyone around you is. You have a history, but we have no history. You're, you know, you're guessing you're, you're trying to make it work. And we're finding now through trial and error and you know, many, many dollars later, we're finding that the Italian and Spanish and varietals and southern Rhone varietals are doing pretty well. It, what was the motivation to do this in such,

Speaker 1:          08:56          you know, sort of, uh, from the beginning manner, you know, I mean, you, you went at it about as his most difficult path as possible to creating a wa to creating a wine.

Speaker 4:          09:07          Um, it's just, it was where I lived and just having traveled around the world, seeing other regions that kind of resembled those regions and uh, I dunno, I Kinda, I'm the on the, uh, the contrarian, you know, say one thing. I'm going to go the other way just to balance things out. So just looking at that place, I just thought, okay, I have an idea. You're looking off your back porch. I'm looking at Atlanta. I said, I go, okay. Um, this sounds like a, I want to try this. Cause how many other vineyards are in Arizona? Uh, well there's, there are now, when I first started there was about 20, maybe 18 bonded wineries. Now there's about 50. Wow.

Speaker 1:          09:48          You model yourself after them. I would look at like what soil they're using, whether it's similar to yours. Did you have like, you know, anything to go on?

Speaker 4:          09:57          Not really, no. I mean, I had a guy from a UC Davis come out and kind of chase his tail a little bit and look at it and go, luck. Now, do you have to treat the soil in any way? Do you have to mulch it or not necessarily you and you have to make some soil adjustments if, if really needed. But you know, in a perfect world, you don't do any of that. He just let it be what it's going to be. So, because you want to really express that place as much as you can and you want to, you want to help, uh, the mines along. If there, if there is some nutrient deficiencies as you go, you'll, you'll notice right away in the vines, um, if you're paying attention, but you can also test for it. You know, they did little petioles tat and like the ends of the vine, you'd send a man who just see what's in them and what's not in them.

Speaker 4:          10:37          So there'll be able to tell you roughly what kind of a wine it'll produce. A No, they'll just let you know whether the plant is healthy. Uh, so what needs nutrients? So, whether or not, I mean we could plant, uh, like I said, we can plan American hybrids there and they'll do great thrive look, look awesome. But the wine's crap. You know, you know, uh, wine made out of Norton this, it's very rare that you have somebody who will impress you with a glass of Norton. I don't even know what Norton is. Manischewitz it's equivalent. The first time I ever heard about an area making things taste differently was, uh, I had a friend who was really in Cuban cigars. Tommy, you have this Vl, oh, I forget what the name of this one area of tube is, but it's a small area, you know, and it's, it's a few hundred acres or something like that.

Speaker 4:          11:27          And in that few hundred acres, they produce all the worlds, Cuban cigars, and it's just whatever's in that soil, just making it up that much about cigars. But I know I've had people hand me, okay, here's, here's three different cigars, um, that have the little thing. He repped off it and try them out. You know who I liked that one Cuban. It's amazing how strong they are. It's amazing. Like what it actually does to you. Like it's a fucking drug. Like if you have a good solid cigar, like, and you're like, Whoa, like I'm high right now. This is a real, yeah, you get motivated to do things. We had a guy in here yesterday, Rob Wolf was a nutritionist. She was telling us that, uh, creativity is enhanced by nicotine, gum, nicotine. It's actually not bad for you. It's bad for you is all the shit that's in cigarettes.

Speaker 4:          12:08          Right. But the nicotine itself actually, you know, so a positive drug, just hard for us to wrap our heads around. So, uh, you, you, you found this spot and how many years did it take you to you producing what you have here today? You have two wines here today. Yeah. Um, these, uh, this, the, the rosacea that I brought, this is the Lelea Nebbiolo Rosé. This is from our southern Arizona Vineyard that we actually purchased. It was an existing vineyard, uh, and, and, uh, Graham County area. It's called Bonita springs been here. So I've been, you know, with my, cause I have, well three, three wineries, a caduceus and American vineyards or are my, my label, I make these wines. And then Arizona stronghold is my sister company and I'm an investor and Co founder of that company. And that company bought these two existing vineyards. Dennis Southern Arizona.

Speaker 4:          12:57          So there's the Arizona strong open, your coachees county out and Wilcox and then the Benita springs vineyard in Graham County. So this is most of your focus right now is making wine. When do you just very well when it, when it comes to harvest time, that's, that's where I have to be. Cause there's, there's no other way around it. It's, that's, you know, my wife runs the lab and I make the wine. So when it's harvest time, uh, Monday, so starting Monday you gather up the grapes and then start the process of turning them into wine. So it's a, it's, it'll, it'll go on through, you know, we'll see our first, uh, we'll see our first white's probably around the first week of August. So I had to basically be back there to just get ready and getting everything ready. What is the process, the fermentation process?

Speaker 4:          13:41          I know you gather up the wine or you gather up the grapes, rather you smash them and then what happens? Well, it depends on, depends on how you, how you do it. There's some, there's some people that, uh, you do the harvest, you bring them in and you actually destem the grapes. You put him into December and it's kind of like a big tumbler and the grapes fall through these holes and these little paddles and knock the stems out the end. And then they'll fall into either a crusher that just kind of pop them and puts them into the bin. And you now they're pumped them into a tank or you put them in a bin and your friend in that way, or has it just stemmed, you just leave them whole berry and that's carbonic masturbation. And so that's more like a peanut Anwar process.

Speaker 4:          14:18          So the produce different results, whether they have a stem or not. Uh, I think personally it might, my choices, I do all my wines, all the reds. I do them a carbonic masturbation with the whole berry. Um, cause I feel like just in the results when you crush him, sometimes, depending on the region, uh, the, the skins and the stems and the seeds, uh, you know, seeds and the seeds and skins mainly when you crush them, we actually have more exposure to those kind of like negative tannins, kind of like a green, uh, tannins and bitter that don't quite, you know, they don't necessarily precipitate out. How did you get involved in all this? Is this something you've always been fascinated with or did you just one day get into it and never looked back? Um, it's, I think it's, you know, I grew up, you know, working in fruit orchards and my dad had a garden and uh, so I think it's just kind of, I kind of fall into it a little bit, you know, reluctantly back then.

Speaker 4:          15:09          Of course you hate it. You don't want to weed, you know what to look for the cut or if you don't want to like do all that stuff. But then when you look back on you actually that was pretty, that was pretty cool. It's hands on, you know, when you see what's the food on your table, you know, as a teenager you don't get it, but later on you go. We made that actually gets you from Ohio originally. Originally from Ohio. Um, I'm also from an io. Awesome. I'm also from Ohio also. And so I also left. He left to go to Michigan. Ah, I see what's going on. And as a, you know, just as a thank you for letting me leave, but we gave you Detroit. So Detroit is now in northern Ohio or I welcome still alive. That's sweet. Bears are moving into Detroit.

Speaker 4:          15:53          So can we try some of this stuff? No, I mean, yes to smell it. Anything. You can try it here. I'll call you one of these. Do you, uh, do you still do a lot of art? Because I knew you went to college for art and a lot of your, your videos are very art based. Uh, do you personally do any arts still or uh, or were you really ever into doing it? I think it was more like the director or producer, you know, I was kind of into the coordinating of getting artists in a room to do things. But, uh, as far as the actual talent, I can't, I can't play piano. I can't play guitar. I can barely draw. How did you become the lead singer of a band then? Accidentally I was the loudest asshole in the room. You were the most bold.

Speaker 4:          16:37          That was a guy who thought I had something to say. Well, uh, Doug, your music man. But of course like everybody, but I really became a fan when I read this piece that you wrote on Hixon Gracie. Why? Uh, you know, you just, you just nailed it. Nailed the whole balance of the balance article and yeah. Yeah. And Hixon himself was a fascinating guy. Well, he's a very few people that I've met that you, you meet him and like right away, you know, there's something different about this cat. And uh, Hixon is incredibly intense guy. That's, it's so rare you find a real martial arts master. So sort of a cliche term that we, uh, you know, we think of an, you know, terms of like movies. The one man who is the master who has it all in control. Well, not to take anything away from Hixson, but I've actually learned more from training with boiler boilers. What amazing. Yeah. Boiler and uh, Carlos Machado. Uh, cause we got to travel around. I just, I can't train consistently, so I can't just walk into a Dojo and just throw my gay and expect not to have my ass handed to me and then not be able to do the show. Right, right, right. So, you know, I was just do privates and I just do them. The guys who

Speaker 3:          17:50          are as old or older than me, so they don't have anything to prove. So it's just like, hey, let's just have some fun. And, uh, I'd rather than trying to put a notch in their belt with my blood,

Speaker 1:          18:00          well, none of the older guys would do that anyway. The, uh, especially the, I mean when you get to the black belt level, no one's trying to, they're very cool about it.

Speaker 3:          18:09          But you know, I can't just walk into a room and just dive into a class. Yeah. Not at, not at the age of 48 going on 50.

Speaker 1:          18:15          Did you used to do that? Did you take classes

Speaker 3:          18:18          earlier on? And that's how I got injured. You walk into the wrong place that they think for some reason you're, you know, challenging their manhood and all of a sudden it's like, dude, I'm in. At that point I only weighed like one 35. So you're rolling into any, any Dojo we're rolling into a year. Like, you know, you might as well be somebody's child.

Speaker 1:          18:35          The real problem is that a blue belt, purple belt stage where you're just trying to get as many kills as you can. And it's like anyone that comes in, I'll look at this guy. He's only 140 pounds. So that's a kill. I'm going to get this one. I'm going, it's not ignoring you. I'm looking for the photo of boiler so I can prove that I actually did that. No, I, no idea. I've seen here, I've seen photos of you and Dave camp, Mario and Bj Penn and I'm sure this wine, by the way, it's delicious. Yeah. What kind is this? What does this, this is a Rosa, Rosa and Nebbiolo. There's, there's my whole life. I just saw him recently and he says one of his fighters fought in the UFC a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker 3:          19:12          I don't know if that will show up. Nope.

Speaker 1:          19:17          I can see his hairline. Incredible family. I want to talk about a family that's had an impact on martial arts. Really, it an amazing thing that in the 1990s with all we thought we knew about martial arts, it's one family from Brazil can have this monstrous impact. And it's funny how like,

Speaker 3:          19:38          well now you know that. And do you still see guys pimping there? You know, dance theater,

Speaker 1:          19:47          sort of much, much more rare, square dance, much more rare than ever before. You know, there's, there's still a few holdouts that are teaching some silly form of something.

Speaker 3:          19:57          Had A, I had a friend who was working with a band and, um, he's, you know, a solid practitioner, uh, finally got his black belt. Um, and uh, but he doesn't even, he did security. He's doing mainly a director of security and for these different tours. And this particular one, you know, he wasn't doing any martial arts. I've just like doing his job and directing what was going on. And then one of the artists was flying this guy in and paying them all this money to do this Kung Fu stuff. You know, he's being respectful. He's just letting that like, and not my place to even insert into that, but like, you know, he's would always like to angle into getting an opportunity on the road because when you're traveling, trying to train and try to do this stuff is, it's almost impossible. It's really hard to do.

Speaker 3:          20:46          Um, and so, you know, if there's any way he can work into at least getting to train with them, that'd be great. So, you know, whenever the opportunity presented itself, he was like, you know, I, I also would, you know, try not to do a Jujitsu. The love to jump in with you guys at some point is to get a workout in or something. And the guy basically said, look, if I'm, you know, it wasn't responding to him. So he's like finally went, look, you know, what we do is like, you know, university level that, that Jujitsu thing is like kindergarten. Some of my buddies like, oh, okay, it's on. So he calls, he calls Hanzo and says, Hanzo, I'm on the east coast. I need a place to go train. And this is what happened in hands. I was like, what the bring them with a fucking come from other fuck it down to the, it was so amazing that like silicon, all this guy is now, he's kind of cornered, he's into, he's kind of basically challenged my friend and my, and my friends trying to be as respectful as possible.

Speaker 3:          21:41          I'm just going to, the guy just kept going and going about with, you know, uh, the, just the disrespect talk. That's how, you know he sucks. Most likely it was, and there's a video online of the schooling and it was a, Oh, really? The video that's online is, it's after like, you know, they started, they did some stuff and it was over so fast that finally handle it. Kept going. Okay, now you can't, you can't hit him. You can't, you can't tackle him. You can't use your arm. Like he kept like taking things away from my guy, still like to make it so that it was just destroying. Yeah. And it was like, just embarrassing. So the guy who hasn't been paying this guy, this money this whole time is looking at this going, what the fuck have I been paying for? Nonsense. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:28          There's a lot of that out there were dancing. Well, for the longest time, that was the majority of martial arts was fuckery. You know, I mean, most of the schools you would find on corners, or my friend, my friend Eddie had a guy that he was taking can food from and the guy went to China to learn secret techniques under this deadly master. And then he found the guy's supposed to be in China. He found his fucking car at the supermarket parking lot. He found the guy in the suit like get the fuck man. I thought you were in China. Oh yeah. I mean I'm on my way to trips kind of town. I was going to Chinatown. It's uh, you know, it was secret. It was a hustle for a long time. All you had to do was pretend you just had to like throw some techniques that you learned from, I mean you could watch a John Claude van Damme movie, kind of get a good idea how he's moving his body and sort of recreate that. And if you are really crazy, next thing you know, you could have a school where you're teaching your own style of self defense. That's completely ineffective.

Speaker 3:          23:18          I want to do when it's like a, it's, you know, practical fighting where you're actually, you know, you're going to be in a bar so you might as well be drunk. So we called it dear son dough and you just show up and immediately kind a six pack and then we start.

Speaker 1:          23:30          That's a good idea, right? We've got to throw your chair away. I know it's dead. I think lunch you grab one of these other ones that don't get used as much. Don't squeak as much. Yeah. Um, I thought that was his back. No, but imagine if it was, that would be a, that would be one of the worst feelings ever. If you dedicated a massive amount of your life to some bullshit and then it's just exposed in front of you like that right now. It happens to a lot of martial artists, man. I've met a lot of people who, you know, whether it was taekwondo or whatever, traditional martial art that had a giant hole in it and they didn't even realize that. Well, it's the same with my friend. He was like, he was a black belt, I think, taekwondo and he will, he rolled into a, uh, uh, Rodrigo Bodgie his place in Saint Louis and went, okay, you know, whatever this is, let me just show you.

Speaker 1:          24:18          And he just had his ass handed to him like repeatedly. Anyone. Okay. I'm sold. Yeah. It was a black belt in taekwondo before ever did. You did so. And when I first did Jujitsu, there was this kid that I'll never forget this purple belt kid my age, my size is nothing special about him. And he's just maul me. Every class he would maul me. It was like I was a baby. Like I couldn't do anything to him. I couldn't defend myself. I'd be exhausted. You just fucking strangle me and I have to tap. It was just so humiliating and humbling. You know? I remember thinking, Wow, I was walking around, not even knowing somebody my size could do that to me. I have no idea. Really had no idea. So living in a completely delusional world of martial arts, proudness. Well, we have to remember that we, the reason that we're a hair at all is at some point during our human development, we, you know, instinctively and just accidentally realized that we can't rely on our strength or speed.

Speaker 1:          25:17          We had to rely on our brain. So cause it, you know, we don't just run out and grab the line and rip its head off. We either run from it and find a stick and sharpen it and you know, go out in teams and you know, take down the elephant with five guys, you know, so that you know, so when you think of martial arts in that manner, you start to realize how important the mental game is as opposed to just the physical game. Well, especially in Jujitsu, it's one of the rare martial arts were technique is really the most important aspect of, of, of the practice. And when you get a really big strong guy, it's actually a disadvantage for a strong guy to learn Jujitsu because the best technical guides are always small, weaker guys cause they have to be technical. Then there's nothing they can muscle or force.

Speaker 1:          26:01          Whereas the big guys, they can get away with some sloppy shit because of the fact that they're big and strong. So they're really hindering themselves by using strength. I mean that's, there's no sport like that and no martial art even like that. I mean technique is very important. And kickboxing, but athleticism and speed is equally important. You know, if you're, if you're very technical but slow, it really won't work. And the Jujitsu, these guys, the, the, the saddest thing about rolling with someone like a Hixon or as John John Machado, it's like they don't even try. Like, it's not like they're straining and moving hardly to slowly, oh my friend. Oh, you're on your back again. Oh, you better protect this arm because this is the one, nine, eight and seven. You're like, what's he going to do? And then he does it and you go, okay, Hixon would do that to black belts who would pick an arm and tell them, I'm going to get your right arm in an arm bar.

Speaker 1:          26:51          And you're like, there's no fucking way. I'm just kidding. Does it want to chicken my in this mother fucker arms over there? Like how are you going to get me in an arm bar? And all of a sudden he's over there and you're tapping out. Yeah, it's, I didn't know that there was something like that before. And when you, once you understand like how technical Jujitsu is, it really become so fascinating. Josh Waitzkin is a, a famous chess player. He was the movie searching for Bobby Fisher was based on him and he sort of got disillusioned with Chaz after a while I got bored with it and devoted the same energy to Jujitsu and he's one of Marcella Garcia, his proteges now. And he has, I think it's called a m m g J and Marcella Garcia Jujitsu inaction Mgj and action.com. And um, it's maybe Mgj Jay. Um, and it's, um, the, the website, he has it broken down the way you would break down chess.

Speaker 1:          27:40          Like he breaks down moves and as different, you know, different transitions, different moves. So you can look at it, you know, and much more may be analytical and you know, a calculated move, move way. And then you would, if you were just over, his name is Josh Waitzkin. Okay. Yeah, there's the guy that, or the trains out of a Hen's Oh, studio in New York. I think his name's John. John Donahoe maybe. Yeah, he's a beast. And it's just like, it's, it's like, it's like the chest. He wants his brain going, okay, this is, this is this millimeter. A philosophy student. He was a university student and it was bouncing. That's what he was doing for fun, you know, or to to pay bills. And along the way someone said, hey, she alerts and Jujitsu and he became completely obsessed, sleeps on the mats. I mean literally teach us all day.

Speaker 1:          28:31          I mean don heard is a legend in Jujitsu circles. He's a suit. It's what happens when a super intelligent guy gets physically absorbed in a sport. Yeah. He's just, uh, he's, he works with a lot of top guys. Like he's always in a George Saint Pierre is corner, he's a, there's a lot of good guys that come out of his jam and there's guys who give good instruction and this guys who suck in the corner and the corner is some guys who just, you listened to them and I have to do everything I can and not criticize them and get the fuck are you saying or that guy like this is nonsense. Like you don't, you're better off saying nothing because you're, you're, you're putting in like an air of despair and idiocy into this, into this cage. They say such stupid shit, but not Donna, her man, Donna.

Speaker 1:          29:13          Hers like Super Precise. You need to hold your left hand slightly higher. Your Chin talked shoulders up, move to your right side. If he's throwing the left first doc on de, then go for a single. The single does not work. You transitioned to a double have water, three deep breath and you're like, Whoa, this motherfucker just got schooled. You know, you hear him talk and you know, this guy knows exactly what I'm supposed to do. If I could just listen to this guy, I think I'm going to be okay. It's a crazy world. The world of intelligence and, and risk and martial art and that's what w you know, people like for the wrong reasons. Associate martial arts and especially associate competition with meatheads assholes, dummies. But the most brilliant minds and some of the most interesting people that I've ever met when martial arts practitioners, because there's a certain amount of calculation you have to do.

Speaker 1:          30:04          While under extreme duress and pressure and there's a risk involved. The risk is like physical health and all those together created an incredible ward. When you're successful in the reward is amazing. But the downside is like mad for most people that the down is too low and they avoid it. And that's the people that can, can make their way through those waters. The, the strongest salmon who get up that waterfall to me, some of the most interesting people that I've ever met. Yup. I would have to agree. Yeah. And that's what I got out of your article. I was like, this guy gets it. He's, you're, you're seeing the essence of a, of what this is all about. How long have you been doing Jujitsu now?

Speaker 4:          30:42          Uh, I started in the mid to late nineties. I got injured right around 2000 and I have only done it, you know, on and off now whenever I can, when you're, when you're doing your wines, it must be like 16 hours a day. My must be. Uh, well, you know, I'm pretty, I'm pretty organized so I, you know, I make sure that whatever I can, whatever I can bring to the table as far as making things easier and smoother and not getting in my own way, like just a lot of logistics and understanding. Like if I do this, I'm going to have to undo this and five moves. So I always like, I've laid things out in a manner that, you know, I'm in the winery around 6:00 AM six 30 but I'm wrapping it up around eight o'clock. So you're a black belt in winemaking, sweating, trying to say I'm a black building logistics, blackbelt logistics, just understanding the process and not getting in my own way.

Speaker 1:          31:33          And then when you go from that mode into musician mode, do you just do it on based on your schedule? Like whenever your time becomes free, you go, okay. You know, starting in

Speaker 4:          31:43          it's October or whatever, a little bit more emotion, a little bit more, a random this with that. With that, you know, you kind of have to kind of ride those waves a little bit. But in a way, when you have enough time under your belt, you can kind of force the situation. You can, you know, a lot of times I just get in my, my truck and I got a decent stereo on the truck and I got the tracks and I just, that way nobody can mess with me. I can't get a phone call and they'll be knocking on the door. I just go park somewhere and turn the music up. But the notepad and start writing, cause nobody now you're in your world. If he might, if I'm in my house, you know the phone's going to ring. I'm going to check my email, I'm going to try to ask a question. Or you know, males in, you know, oh it's that super troopers on HBO again. So much for writing. Yeah. That's why. Right when everyone's asleep. I don't, don't even start until 11:00 PM 12:00 PM everyone in my house

Speaker 1:          32:37          asleep. I liked it when people around me are asleep too. I'd like

Speaker 4:          32:40          to think the neighbors are sleep. I like to think that I'm not picking up any weird vibes from anybody. Everybody's in Z zone. Right. You know? But do you, um, when you, when you write, do you have like specific times where you set aside time to write? He just try to do it whenever the creative whim, whim, you know, just kind of do it, you know, it'll be like focused periods of time. Like I'm at this week is going to be dedicated to any, and same thing with training. If I'm at a train or if I'm at, I'd be doing Jujitsu, I'm going to do any of that stuff. I will hire somebody to be there because now I have to do it. Right. So if I have friends that were, you know, musician friends, they flown out, we're going to write this week, okay, I'm in my truck, I'm over here and want to come in and we're going to track some stuff that didn't work back to the truck.

Speaker 4:          33:24          Why Arizona? That's where I live. Just always lived there. I moved there in [inaudible] 95. Really? Why 95 I hate La. Hate your town. Let's not mine, but I don't like it either. And tried to escape, moved here and basically December of 89, so, you know, basically 1,990 January. And uh, it just, it only took a little bit of time. I mean, I got, don't get me wrong, I got a lot out of this town. Things, you know, odd things happen for me. Um, you're just kind of set the ball in motion. I mean there's, you know, I was doing a lot of things, we'll buy life before I moved to La. Um, and there's a lot of achievements and things that I'd, that I'd kind of done for myself. And, uh, but then it wasn't until I was actually in la in a band where somebody who's profiting on my decision making that you actually heard about me.

Speaker 4:          34:13          So, you know, there's a lot of things that I was kind of doing before I got here. And then I fell into the band thing and that kind of got popular. And, uh, that was my actually stuck here for as long as I did. Cause I just within like a couple of years, I was like, this is not for me. I don't, I need to be in a small town. When it got to a certain point, have the fame of tool, you could pretty much have done whatever you want to anyway because you're mostly just touring and you just had to be around the people when you were rehearsing and preparing. Right. Kind of. Yeah. I think a little bit more hands on than that, but, uh, you know, for the most part, uh, that was, that was the case. But, you know, and then been been from 95 to 2000.

Speaker 4:          34:49          I kind of bounced back and forth a little bit from Arizona to here just because of the work. You know, you have to, when you're recording and doing stuff, he had to kind of be there for Nda. Right. You're on the road for pretty much. And that in those days it was easily six months out of the year, a year traveling. But of course, you're younger than you can handle it. Now. The area you're out, it's like, that's like a haunted wild west town, right? It's an old, it's an old copper mining town. Uh, it's like a billion dollar copper mine. It had this huge or body underneath this side of this hill, $1 billion worth of copper. And that was like, you know, 1920s, 1930s billions. So it was like, it was a huge or body, like big enough to put a cathedral in the hole in the ground that they took all the copper up.

Speaker 4:          35:33          And did you pick this area because it just seemed like an area or you don't really like the vibe of it? No, I am at, I had a dream. I was supposed to be out of fucking la. He got it. Yeah. And I just kept having this recurring dream and it's like a, you know, it was a very specific images and place. And uh, I think, you know, for some reason I thought it was Arizona and a, I remember talking to Hicks about it and I go on, I think, I think it was supposed to be in Arizona. And uh, I mentioned that to Tim Alexander and you know, I said, I've been to Phoenix, I'm not, I'm not having it. Um, and I described the dream and Tim went, oh, I know what that is. See Cause he's from, he's from Arizona. And so he went, okay, I have to take you some place.

Speaker 4:          36:20          We drove up there and like rolling into that valley just going, Holy Shit, this is the place. Wow. And then I got up to the town, it's like, no shit. Do you interact with the town's folks? Because to me that's the hardest thing about moving to anywhere. It's, you've got to find cool people, you know, in the, I am the absolute troublemaker in that time. It comes in, you know, they, you know, it's uh, it was an old mining town. It kind of, they kind of turned, a lot of that went away. It's like 20,000 people in this town at one point. And we'd have working the mind like, and then the Clarkdale area and to Cottonwood area and draw Mary work in his mind, you know, when, uh, want to dry it up and you know, there was the depression and the World War One and doing all that kind of stuff.

Speaker 4:          37:00          It kind of shut down. It dropped down to like, you know, 30 people in this small town. Whoa. And then of course, you know, the 70, 60, 70, so the draft Dodgers and the people that just wanted to do what they wanted to do, uh, moved into this basically in abandoned town. You, anyone new Bisbee no. Uh, I'm sure we're Bisbee is, but it's not, I think it's more on the, on the edge of the state and somewhere it's very weird, but a very similar, very similar scenario. So you know, the trust fund babies and the hippies moved in, kind of took over the town and uh, there for them, you know, for the most part, the people that moved into the town are not the kind of people that built the town, not the kind of visionary as it came in and went, I think there's copper under this thing and then did all this stuff.

Speaker 4:          37:44          I'm more like those people. And so I'm kind of the enemy because I do stuff, you know, heaven forbid. Um, so how you a trouble maker and the town though, anyone, they don't, you know, they fear change. And you know, we came here to retire and then not do anything. Well you make too much noise or too strange. I just stuff I'm just doing stuff, bringing by, you know, by discovering the terroir there and making wine there. I'm bringing people to town. You're what you're bringing people on. We went on to new people in town. So you're telling how they going to pay for your pipes in your electric and how are going to make your streets be safe. It's a municipality, not a camping ground. You need, he need funding. You need tax dollars to fix your thing. And you know, the best way to really fix your town is if you have something that's unique to your town and export, if you will.

Speaker 4:          38:33          I found it. How dare I? So you're doing well for the town and they just don't like anything moving or anyone to make them feel. There's a handful of people that are like the hand. There's a handful of people that are basically, they're their mos. You just lay in the street and if you can move them, okay, then you can kind of go down the street. But if you can't move them and you give up, they win and you just kind of sail tail between your legs and you leave. I don't, I don't know how to move stuff. That's my problem with La is that La is where my friends are and if I had to move to another place, I'd have to deal with a bunch of fucking people and all their nonsense, you know, unless you bring everybody with you, which is also going to start a complicated.

Speaker 4:          39:09          Yeah, get all Kuresh on it. Do you have friends out in Jerome? Yeah, absolutely. Did you have them already? You know, Amy, I made a lot of friends, just some really, really awesome artists in that town, like really good people. And they all mean well that, don't get me wrong, all of every single person in the talent means well, and they're all good people. But you know, that's just personalities and small town politics, but still better than the insane buzz of this hive this fall. Yeah, 30 million. Hi. I much prefer the conflict that we have with our, with our people and in Jerome over whatever the hell it was. It went over there on the five and the third one 34 today. Hey, we just decided to shut this ramp down. Well, have you ever flown in to lax and you see the four oh five and you see literally seven eight nine 10 miles of stopped cars and you crawl into your overhead Bin and hope that they just let you go back to Tokyo is like, what the fuck is that?

Speaker 4:          40:02          This is craziness. This is just, we're just banking on nothing going wrong ever in a place where the earth moves. Yeah. Yet here I am like an idiot. I'm trying to get out. I'm, I'm working on right now. I'm working on my next move any minute now. I tried Colorado for a little bit. It's a long story, but my dog got eaten by a mountain lion. I came back. Yeah. Colorado is a weird, when like you go to Denver and there's that area where almost everybody's missing an eye and arm or in a wheelchair or a walker. That's like a weird, like, like a twin peaks. But like on steroids area and you kind of go, we have, we'd have contests like okay, we're here for 24 hours, whoever can count the most wheelchairs and, and you know, three points for a wheelchair. One point for like a missing arm and be people coming back to like, you know, the soundcheck going, I got 40 points. Really? What area of Denver is this? It's right on that 16th street promenade area right there in no sin in the center of town there. It's insane. It's, you're, you're, you're there for, if you're there for longer than 12 hours, start going, what's going on?

Speaker 4:          41:05          Is there like a, you know, they, they testing out these things. Are they, are these people actually in them? I've never noticed. I picked Denver because it's got a strong medical marijuana community. And then so once you get used to, the way they have it set up in La is you can't deal with the nonsense of dealing with drug dealers. It's just become so stupid. But Denver set up pretty much exactly like Ella is Denver in boulder. There's places everywhere. They have a, I think they call it broad stir. Damn. When they have one area where it's

Speaker 1:          41:34          a, I think it's Broadway, there was this like, you know, bakery shops and you know, the whole deal. It's got a good, they have to like a sensible liberal vibe. You know, Denver in a Boulder's a little bit more radical, but Denver has a sensible openminded vibe. Like they support guns and they support hunting and they support outdoors activities, but they're also in favor of gay marriage and they're also in favor of not discriminating. And you know, so it's, it's a very interesting, that's why I picked it, but Arizona always scared me, man. It's, it's definitely a scary place when, in terms of

Speaker 3:          42:05          all those things you just mentioned. But I think it's, I think all that stuff's kinda changing there because you can't have something that's so far one way and not have a pushback and have and have and have a community that's just the complete polar opposite. And it's absolutely there. So eventually it'll just kind of come around.

Speaker 1:          42:23          The, the idea of living in cities, I think it's one day not going to be necessary anymore. I think we needed it because everybody had to be on top everybody. Cause that's where you worked and you know, in order to communicate with everybody. But now because of the Internet, I think, uh, there's a lot of people's jobs that don't have to be in, in the swarm.

Speaker 3:          42:40          Yeah. I mean there's a lot of, there's definitely a lot of just change in general happening with the, just the way we think about stuff. And, um, I don't know about you, but I've had like a had a week there about two months ago or it's just, everything just seemed like the gyroscopes were off and I couldn't, I couldn't get anything right. It was like I'd forgotten how to do the most simple things, you know, like, you know, not, not the perfect example. I got to walk outside to change a tire and I've got like a carrot and a candle. Like, okay, well

Speaker 1:          43:11          one lane, there was a cycle, like a vibe or I think, I think it's, I still kind of feel a little bit, yeah.

Speaker 3:          43:16          But I was like, I was, I kind of called a friend who, uh, she's, you know, she's as crazy as I am. It really, she's like, uh, she does a complete Kundalini Yoga. You, unless she wakes up at 4:00 AM to watch the sunrise and do the breath of fire. And so she's, you know, how the, she's a complete Kook and I'm an, I drank the Koolaid or, or we're onto something here. But, uh, you know, she, she said just being a funny, you should ask that because that's kind of what we're, what she's seeing in her world, how everything's done, you know, the gyroscopes or just kind of off and uh, and the biggest, I think the biggest thing she was suggesting and has kind of done some reading on it as well, is like, it's just more a matter of paying attention. I'm not letting it get to you, uh, not being like all, you know, Tony Robbins and get all, you know, positive greeny guy, but, uh, you know, just like know that it's all gonna work out and don't let the petty shit get you down. Don't let the, the dark stuff sink in because it's almost like you're in a record groove, you're in the light groove, and if you let, if you've flop over to the dark groove, you kind of get stuck in that groove and it's kind of a downward spiral.

Speaker 1:          44:26          So one thing that I've found it's most difficult to deal with when you deal with a large city or a large as you are, you're constantly getting other people's energy in there. It's sometimes hard to dictate your own path. And that's what she was saying

Speaker 3:          44:39          because I think in a way you have to kind of just not hang out on a fear. Just kind of settle in calmly and just like we're talking about what the Jujitsu, the guy, he's big and he's strong and he's got technique, but you just had to take a deep breath and some level know that one way or another it's all gonna work out as Kundalini Yoga people are fascinating. A buddy of mine has a friend that does the same thing

Speaker 1:          45:03          every morning. She does the breath of fire and she claims to achieve psychedelic states. She says that, uh, because of all her years of practice, she, it's just like as if she's taking heavy drugs, she goes to other worlds and communicates with entities and you know, and has, what she describes is indescribable experiences. She said, if I told you what I could do just with my own breath exercises and couldn't Daleney Yoga, you wouldn't believe me.

Speaker 3:          45:26          Right. And you know, most of my friends that are in into that stuff, into that deep, they don't talk about it just because it's such an individual experience. And uh, and I had another friend who I'm going to similar, a similar path and you know, she kind of grew up in the, in the 60 was everybody's doing, you know, doing acid and stuff. And uh, she had mentioned that, you know, it was Kinda, it was cool for the, the jumpstart for people to kind of get into that consciousness and be thinking on that level. But at the same time, they didn't really do the work to get there. So they really didn't understand what it was they were experiencing. So when away she called it spiritual theft, but you got like, and all of a sudden you're just right in the middle of this thing, but you don't really have any business being there.

Speaker 3:          46:06          Right. You can't really process what it is that you're experiencing. Recreational mushroom trips. Yeah. And so, yeah, it's so you're like, here you are. And then, you know, for most people that just, that's lights out for them. They're going to be a little mark the rest of their lives. But I kind of agree with that. I think that some of the work taking that time and really taking your time, getting to those states are in just in your life in general and doing anything. Um, but it's, it's really difficult for most people these days because they want what they want when they want it because they're so used to getting whatever the fuck it is they want when they want it to. They don't get it. They lose their shit. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          46:43          Which is exactly opposite of the psychedelic experience. What it would teach you. I think, um, the, the approach is so important and doing the work and saying, doing the work is so important because you're treating whatever this experience is, is going to be with a, a deep amount of respect. And unless you do that, you know, I don't think you're, you're really going to get the most out of it. I mean, if you just go into it and try to just, uh, let it cure you or let it figure you out or let it, you're just going to be too blown away with the whole thing to really absorb any of it. Right. You're doing the work. And like, one of the things that I really appreciated about the people that really get into Kundalini Yoga is they all seem legit. I haven't met anybody who claims the psychedelic states who, who doesn't really like a humble person. It really seemed like there, there's never any weird ego shit or you know, weird, a trace of bullshit. It's, it seems like this, this is just what they do. And they'll tell, talk to you about it and they'll describe it to you. But they say it's not about the, it's not about the psychedelic state of it. It's all about just like a sort of a, a, it's about knowing that it's going to go in knowing that it's all gonna work out.

Speaker 3:          47:51          Yeah. You know, and we might not even be included in this form that we're in and how it's gonna work out. And if you can let go of the fear of worrying about whether that's going to happen or not. As soon as you can just let go of that fear and just, you know,

Speaker 1:          48:04          let go. Just appreciate what is, appreciate what it is. Don't worry about what Ken, what would, what may appreciate what is and know that even if it doesn't work out, it's going to work out cause it's all works out even if it doesn't work out. Exactly. It's too hard for us to wrap our heads around how big the whole picture is. You know, when you realize that, you know, what is the, um, the, the Woodstock song, we are stardust. We are golden. We are billion year old carbon. Well we're, we really are fucking Joni Mitchell. Yeah. Joni Mitchell, who was the Crosby stills they covered is what it was. That's her song. Yeah. Brilliant Song. And it's so true. This is the thing that people don't understand. Human beings actually made because the star Burns out, explodes. And it has to happen. If it doesn't happen, you don't make those materials and human life, carbon based life forms don't, don't, don't exist. So even if it doesn't work out, it works out right. It doesn't, you know, you can understand in are in the state that we're in and you know, this

Speaker 3:          49:03          real tactical, tactical, tactical, uh, existence that we live, you know, you get caught up with the game, you know, you kind of get into the fear. Yeah. Uh, and uh, that's part of it. Super easy. So it's okay. You know, but every now and he'd get kind of wrapped up in it. And, uh, I remember like last week, uh, the same guide to do Jitsu guy that I was telling you about, Todd, he, uh, he's, he just out of the blue texted me like, so man, how's it going? Like, it's almost like intuition. Like, how's it going? Like, funny you should ask, it's been a shit storm the whole week. And he goes, Oh, well let me just give you this. And he sent me this, I hope I brought it, you send this thing. I ended up forwarding it to a bunch of people because I knew a bunch of other people were going through some weird shit and uh, may I sure polluted so live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart trouble.

Speaker 3:          49:57          No one about their religion, respect others in their view and demand that they respect yours. I love your life. Perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day. When you go over to the great divide, always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting up or passing a friend, even a stranger when an a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none when you arrived in the morning and give thanks for the food, for the joy of

Speaker 4:          50:28          living. If you see no reason for giving thanks. The fault lies only in yourself. Uh, abused. No one and no thing for abuse turns the wise ones into fools. And Rob's a spirit of its division. When it comes your time to die being out like those whose hearts are filled with fear and death so that their time comes, they weep, they pray for more, a little time and live their lives again over and over in a different way. Instead sing near death song and die like a hero going home. That's fucking beautiful. Like, so of course all my friends are like, you know who wrote that? So I had to go back to him and go, where'd you get that? He goes, uh, homeless do gave it to me. Wow. It's Jesus. It's like, please don't say it's l, Ron Hubbard. I would be my luck like Adolf Hitler. Well it sounds like I, I actually, it's uh, I actually found it online and it's uh, chief Tecumseh crouching tiger from the, uh, from the shiny nation. Whoa. He died in 18, 13. Wow. Wow. That makes it even

Speaker 1:          51:36          more cool. Cause I thought it was some new age douchebag, probably pilfered some stuff off the internet and pieced it together. No, that's perfect. Yeah, I agree with everything you said. Except for Megan. Front of religion.

Speaker 4:          51:50          You go, girl. Other than that it's got me, I think religion has to be made fun of it

Speaker 1:          51:55          because if you can't make fun of things that are ridiculous, you're missing out on a big part of what's fun about this life and religions. Ridiculous respect it, but made fun of it, right? Yeah. Yeah. Other than that, I'm down town with the Shawnee warriors. He had thought that was great that he, you know, he says some homeless dude while we lost, we lost such a massive chunk of what those people had learned about living this life of nomadic life, of following animals and you know, following, following herds of buffalo around and, and learning about the connection between, I mean, you gotta think about the, the, the deep respect native Americans had for the animals that they killed. And you know, it's, it's such a, an interesting way of life. They, they kept up for so long while most of the Western world had already moved on to, you know, riding horses and Kingdoms and houses and agriculture and these people were just traveling around and living off the land. It says so much wisdom we could have learned from those people and it was wiped out. It's a, it's, it's a weird time too when you think about that. Just that was just a couple of hundred years ago, a blip in human civilization and there was these nomadic people, you know, living in this area. I remember watching a, I went to movies with my son is a few years ago and it was that a black stallion movie. It's, you know, some animation. I mean, and it was pretty, I'm just kind of sitting in the theater, just kind of,

Speaker 3:          53:26          it kind of dawned on me and I'm kind of like, I'm like the, the curmudgeon with his son. Like, you know, my kid just going, can you just enjoy the movie please? But I'm looking at it going, this whole movie is based on this exhilarating feeling of like this black horse and this guy kind of stopping the white man for moving west. And it's like, but I'm watching the fucking movie in Los

Speaker 1:          53:48          and my son's just like, will you let it go and just enjoy this movie and get me more popcorn? Please. Yeah. It's like you rude against us. I mean, that's what Avatar is. Yeah. I mean, avatars don't think they're coming back. Yeah. That was the first shit. UNOBTAINIUM billions of dollars, I think obtaining them ever coming back. I mean, that was the Santa Maria, right? Our ship. That was the beginning of the first wave of the fuckers until I tried the other stuff. What do you, what is your, this is the, this is the Shinola. I'm really a red wine guy. I love that. Rosa. It's delicious. This is a, this is a special

Speaker 3:          54:34          drop. Um, we had, we got hit with Frost really hard and, uh, early 2011, so we didn't have a lot of Arizona fruit in our vineyards to work with. So I panicked and I, uh, is this one yours here? We, yeah. And I sourced some fruit from right over the border from our, our vineyards right down on the, on the border, uh, on the 10 as you're heading toward New Mexico, it's in Wilcox in that area. So right over that border, like another hour or so, just pass. Wilcox is a New Mexico vineyard and this guy's out there, great grower. He's got all these fantastic Italian varietals growing there and there. You know, there's a historic, it's a pretty old vineyard there. So I picked these all these grapes up for, uh, not much. And uh, did this blend. It's Sangiovese. They'd dual Choate over phospho and premed Tivo. So it's a straight up the Italian blend. It's delicious from New Mexico grapes. And it's, what do you call it? Shinola.

Speaker 1:          55:29          Come on. Cause that your own name. Yeah. Oh No. What? I mean, you know, it's the, is that a type of wine? It's actual type of wine. It's a, it's a reference to the jerk. The shit from Shinola. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Wow. Recognize? Um, yeah, New Mexico is a, a fascinating area. You know, I think, uh, that's where it, val Kilmer went and grew his head. That's where I was watching magical space. I was watching the ghost and the darkness the other day and I was like, there's a funny fucking Internet meme where it's Val Kilmer at is most bloated. And it says, remember when I was Batman, lol, Val Kilmer moved to to, uh, New Mexico and just bought a ranch and just grew his head. I don't know what the fuck happened, but in this ghost and the darkness, I'm like, Jesus Christ. I was a handsome man. It was stunning. And we just decided, you know what, I'm, I like pills better.

Speaker 3:          56:24          I'm just new. Moved to New Mexico, that movie a couple years ago with, uh, uh, Robert Downey Jr.

Speaker 1:          56:32          Yeah. Well it was that crazy movie. He's struck a little. Yeah, he's trying, he's got it under control. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like you realize, fuck, am I doing, I kinda liked it. Yeah. It was a fun movie. I don't remember what it was though. What the hell was it called? Some sort of a, and involve letters. Yeah. And range and in a certain order and I can't remember any of them. Yeah. They all get blurry after a while. Um, you became buddies with one of my biggest influences in one of my biggest idols is Hicks. How did you, uh, how'd you meet him? How did that

Speaker 3:          57:02          go down? Uh, well, you know, as a, as, as you do, you kind of just, somebody can hand you a cassette back in the day. It's, it's a cassette. It's a, it's a tape recording and it goes around and around, um, uh, you know, right around the same time as a eight tracks, but he got the cassette of one is to first, uh, releases and uh, on the, on the road just like absorbing all this stuff. And an eventually we, uh, when we put out another record, we basically thanked him on it and, uh, send them a copy of the record and he reached out and then we just kind of hit it off and we hit on all these plans. This was back, you know, earlier, earlier tool days. So, um, you know, we had all these plans that we wanted to kind of do something with him.

Speaker 3:          57:46          And, uh, we were, you know, we were still kind of a young bands. This is like 93, 94 and, uh, we were going to do a tour together and uh, then he got sick. That kind of allow, you know, plans right out the window, kind of suck at. Right. Right. When the time was, we were small enough to where we could still, we could actually do a comedy tour, you know, with a comedian and a rock band. Uh, as soon as it was, you know, a year later there was, things kind of blew up a little bit and it would have been, yeah. I mean, for example, we played several shows in the California area where a tenacious d opened for us, but we were big enough band where people in the honors, she's like, get this shit off the stage. I like throwing shit at them. When we had the, we've had like David Cross and Greg Behrendt do stuff in front of our, uh, a show to open the thing and just getting pelted with stuff now, you know, that wouldn't happen now because they know who they are, but

Speaker 1:          58:40          it was still happening. Yeah. I know. People are brutal, man. Yeah.
