Speaker 1:          00:00:00       You know, uh, you know, it's funny. I'll tell you later. Tell me now. Three, two, one. What's funny, uh, I was going to tell you a funny story about your address, but it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be funny for you. We'll talk later about that. You and I, we share African ancestry. Yeah, yeah. I was shocked. Yeah. I'm one point six percent. Oh really? See, I have more, uh, I have more credentialed in math departments. Your two percent, right? Yeah. No, and it's funny because, you know, you sort of have your, the story in your family, kind of like where he came from and everything mates. And I always knew I was 25 percent, you know, Italian. Uh, and I knew that my family came from Sicily. In fact, uh, the, the, the Rainelle is that came from Sicily all seemed to become kind of established in the, in the produce world. Uh, my dad was brought up in the south side of Chicago. I'm 44 years old. Okay. So think about that for a minute. My Dad was brought up in south side of Chicago and he was raised by his grandfather who was Sicilian, had come from Sicily, his grandfather delivered produce with a horse and cart whoa in Chicago, so

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       to have lived through that, like to be brought up in a house where a guy like leaves in the morning and a horse and cart to deliver, produce an end to be alive, like to fight in world war two to be through the atomic era, the advent of the Internet. Right. But I always knew that we had Sicilians when I did the genetic test, what some of those. At some point in time, one of those Sicilians must have shot southward and crossed the Mediterranean and lightheaded hookup down there. Something. Well, that was the history of Sicily in the first place. Yeah. Cecily just being Sicilian in the first place. There was so many people that were a impregnated by the doors and by various people of West Africa and North Africa. Yeah. Yeah. I should've probably like, always assumed, but it just, I hadn't thought about it.

Speaker 1:          00:02:11       Um, another thing I was reading about this stuff. And you might know more about it than I do, is that when you do those tests, there's missing parts, you know, it does it like it captures what's there. But there's could be a lot there that's not captured just in the way that chromosomes are inherited and passed down. Like it's, it's an incomplete picture. Right. There can be influences. There could, there could be in your. It doesn't create a full picture of your lineage. There could be lineages that are there that aren't represented in your particular makeup. How so? Like what do you mean? He know? I hate to right off the bat, get into south that I can't speak about any level of expertise. I was just reading a piece and the piece I was reading to do it was kind of a dissection of like what happened with Elizabeth Warren when she claimed we've been going off about that on the podcast and I'm like 100 times more African than she is native American.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       Yeah. Well that's what I found. I'm 10 times more or whatever. But there was a piece about. It was, it was a piece in the times explaining like how to make sense of now that everyone's doing these tasks, like how to think about, make sense, these tests, but, but my understanding of it is that you could have a lot of ancestry that isn't captured in your genetic code and the way that would be detected through the testing. Meaning there could be ancestors it for what? [inaudible] you're inheriting half, you know, your Harrington chromosomes from each parent in somehow you could have. It could be an incomplete picture. You could have ancestors that had come from other, you know, whatever. These, these tests break out the world and do a 100 or some odd regions or zones that there could be people from those zones who were in your lineage that are not captured in your personal, that are not captured in your genetic code.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       That's so bizarre. You would think it would all be in there. So that's just a, an incomplete measuring tool. Is that what it is or is it just actually not in there? I don't know. I'm going to have to have a dude on. Yeah, I'll listen. You need to understands it and as I say, I feel like I'm off on a bad start here, man. I'm much a neanderthal. Didn't say less than normal. Really less than average. The, uh, the number it said it gives you what you did. Twenty three and me, right? Yeah, I can't remember. I can't remember. I just remember it was less than average and you know, and those things like our refined by how many people do, um, you know, but it was less than average, which bummed me out, but I'm like, his hair is like a 13 year old Norwegian girl, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       So it's surprise, shocking, didn't surprise me too much. Uh, I was wishing to have a little more of that floating around in me. It's a bizarre heritage, you know, the idea that there was a different type of human that bread with Homo sapiens and that there's little bits and pieces of it floating around and people. Yeah, people discuss them. People discuss, I'll say an argument the other day where they see a neanderthal or neanderthal and everyone grows up saying neanderthal. It's one of those things you're supposed to switch once you realize how you're supposed to do it, right. Neanderthal, but I just can't get comfortable with it. I go back and forth. There's a lot of words that like that were. I know you're supposed to do it, but I can't get comfortable with it because I feel like it makes you sound pretentious. It's like rolling your r's and certain Spanish words, but we had this idea that the. We had this idea, the neanderthals as unsuccessful. Right, right. They are these brutish thugs that died out, but they had a 600,000 year run in Europe alone. 600,000 years longer run than Homo sapiens have actually existed. Yeah. Yeah. So whatever. I don't know that we're going to hit like, I don't know that we're going to match up and have that run. Well, we'll probably have a 23 and

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       me for whatever the fuck is after us. They look somebody back then fuck the human. Like, oh, one of those crazy warmonger Mexican rapists, thieving humans died out. It turns out they didn't totally die out. Overrun with emotions and lies and someone, someone of a superior race infiltrated the humans and banged one of them. Yeah, it's, it's, it's funny to look at that, that understanding of those, that understanding of those people. I'm an end to have the site to picture in your mind's eye, even though you can't picture it, like what was look like when they were hooking up. Someone are, you know, like anatomically, behaviorally modern humans were hooking up with neanderthals was that was. How is it perceived by their peers? I bet the people that we think of as people back then, like, you know George, the animal steele is no George.

Speaker 2:          00:06:56       The animal steel is a very famous progress or from back in the day, and I thought you were gonna. Say It was a paleontologist or anthropologists Rasler just arrest pro wrestler. Very famous guy who could be a fucking cave man. Like legitimately could be a cave man. See if you, uh, you got a good image of him. Now, this is what I think when I think of people now give me a full body. One day you go, oh, when I think of people he's hanging onto, so homo sapiens, Homo sapiens from, you know, 200,000 years ago, I think at George the animal steele. I think there were something like that. So the idea of George fucking a neanderthal chick, not that far off. I think our idea is that like Dan rather would be out there banging some monkey lady. I just don't think. I don't think that's the case.

Speaker 2:          00:07:48       Like look at George's body. Jesus fucking Christ. He's got the hairiest shoulders I've ever seen in a man. She's still alive. I do not know. I don't believe he is. I hope he's not listening right now. I don't believe he is a, he's a legend. Legend in the world with the pro wrestling. So it's going to take more notes to hurt his feelings. That guy don't give a fuck. He's a legend. But uh, when I was in a kid in high school, oh, he's, he's olds. Fuck yeah, he's a pro. Well those guys, they all. That's a hard way to make a at that. At Age 79, he had a good run. Yeah. That's a good run for, for those guys. That's a fucking hard way to make a living. But have we were talking about, uh, the, the idea of neanderthals is like having a Ca, a confrontational hunting style? No, I don't think we have because when, when, when anthropologists look at the, the skeletal remains of neanderthals, they see this sort of suite of this pattern of injuries on them and a researcher is looking at the types of fractures that they have on their bones in where the fractures occurred and the breaks and cracks

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       and they're scholes. He was looking at all this and wound up working with a doctor who had a lot of exposure to rodeo riders, bull riders and the doctor was, was observing the way in which that suite of injuries was very familiar to him from rodeo riders, the types of breaks and the location of brakes. And this guy has this idea that they had a, like a very confrontational hunting style that they're mixing it up with big animals. And another thing they found is that when you're looking at skeletal remains from early people, you still see that separation in the saxes right, that, that the males would suffer injuries at with a greater prevalence than females. But with the neanderthals, it seems like they didn't have the sort of like duplicity of roles. So many of the females, the females have the same prevalence of, of these types of injuries.

Speaker 1:          00:10:00       Whoa. And so maybe they didn't have that, the, they didn't share that division of labor where the females as large as the males. Yeah. I don't know the answer to that. So we know that they had stone tools, right? The crude stone tools. Yeah. But we don't know whether or not they had anything that could launch them. Like they didn't have to. They would, do, we know if they had spears, I don't believe that they've found they had adult adult and I don't know if they were hafting materials, but they were doing, they were doing art. Um, and I think there's a little bit of a debate about whether they're doing representational art, but they were doing art. They were doing, they were probably making jewelry and is like, these are all things that as, as we kind of like wake up to what these people really like and it paints like a more complicated picture.

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       There's even this theory and I don't know if this held any water, how long it was fashionable for, but you had this really long history of it was extremely long history of hundreds of thousands of years in the Andrew Fall, you know, occupation in Europe and then it seemed to be the. I remember someone putting forth this idea that it seemed to be that there was this flourishing of advancement that was contemporaneous with the arrival of our own ancestors in Europe is though, uh, they were being exposed to or seeing art and seeing jewelry and mimicking this from these new invaders that were coming in. But I don't know where that idea sits right now. I don't know if it's been dispelled because of other discoveries and everything does an interesting idea that they would then it kind of paints this really sad picture, right? That they would be sort of in the autumn, you know, of their existence and here's these adorned people showing up with these amazing tool kits and all these abilities and kind of struggling to start a catch up, you know, it'd be like the country Bumpkin, you know, go into the big city and.

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       Yeah. Well there was also this idea,

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       I think up until very recently that neanderthals were not as violent as humans as homo sapiens. But now there was an article that was published just a couple of days ago that new evidence shows that neanderthals like internet and tall violence between each other. It was just as bad as homosapians. Yeah. And find that in evidence of cannibalism. Oh yeah. There was a lot of that. Right. Scraping of inside of the skulls indicative of tools. Oh, ad blocker got busted. They get us every time with the fucking ad blocker. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:12:28       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:30       what does it say? Humans are just as violent as neanderthals.

Speaker 4:          00:12:33       Are you familiar with the writer John Mu Allen? No. You'd like his stuff. He wrote a really beautiful piece about. He wrote a really beautiful piece about neanderthals not long ago.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       Okay. I fucked it up. What they're saying is that modern humans were just as prone to violence as neanderthals. I don't have a problem. I think I'm conflating this with something else that I read about. Inter Inter interspecies violence neanderthal on neanderthal violence. The other thing that's weird about them, as they had bigger brains than us, they had bigger brains and they would be like five, seven and weighed 200 pounds. Just jacked. Just a little gorilla thing. You know, it'd be great to see it. There is a really dumb theory that was being bounced around a few years ago. It was really hilarious about how, uh, we wiped out. We assumed that neanderthals, because you don't have any soft tissue samples, we've seen that neanderthals looked similar to humans, but because of the very different shape of their skull this guy had, instead of giving them European looking white skin, turn them into a gorilla, turned them into a giant muscle bound gorilla that preyed on people. And this was like, I believe it was an actually is actually was a professor. And it seemed almost like a goof at first. Do you remember this champion? We pulled this up a few times, like killer neanderthal theory, think you call it, but he had drawn this thing black, like a gorilla with like giant muscles all over the place and these big crazy eyes and that painting neanderthals as a Predator of humans and that's why we wiped them out. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:14:08       That my limitations as

Speaker 4:          00:14:13       I see I, I'll just say my limitations as an, as an anthropologist, I'm certainly not an anthropologist at all. Just a dude who's interested in it. But one of my limitations is I'll hear theories floated. Okay. And I don't follow them long enough to see which ones have any traction. Right. I'll just read about them and I don't take it as Gospel, but I'll read about it and I'll be like, that's interesting. And was sort of shaped my understanding of it. But then I don't keep track of it. Like I try to really follow the story of like the peopling of the Americas. So when it comes to the human history of the Western Hemisphere, I sort of follow and like ideas will get floated and

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       they'll track the idea to see where it lands in terms of scholarly consensus, but on other stuff with neanderthals, I'm always a sucker for a neanderthal story, but I don't track

Speaker 2:          00:15:01       what ideas that float up or just very quickly denounced as being complete rubbish. Mm. Yeah. It's a weird one. You know, it takes time to. It takes time to follow this stuff. Go, go to that other picture. That's what it is them them and, and uh, yeah. But look at some of his images. Look at that image that he has on the cover of the book. Like those are the idea. There's some way better ones. There's some way better images with they drew of a full body ones. They had a. is it in the article? This was a link to your website from a different article. Just go, go to that and then go to images because there was some really bizarre fucking. Yeah, there it is. Upper left hand corner. This is what, this guy.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       Yeah. Well, that thing, whatever he's got going on, that thing is not making art.

Speaker 2:          00:15:54       You don't think so? No. He's making meat, man. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty preposterous. But neanderthals didn't have things like that. Did they know what is that? He's he morphing in neanderthal into a gorilla that was trying to do. Oh, that's Ah, a monkey gorilla. Neanderthal. But yeah. But like, whoa. It's got it snarling with it's fucking vegetable eating teeth.

Speaker 2:          00:16:22       Anyway, it's, it's a. and then there's the do even know what those Denovo eons to. How do you say that word? The one from Russia. They didn't have any idea what they looked like right now. I don't look like so pinky bones and shit, you know, have that. That one's not that one. I don't know him in your cookbook is fucking fantastic. It's really good. Yeah. You put a lot of God damn work into that thing. We started collecting images for it years ago. He could tell it's really good because I didn't want it to look like I'm.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       What was it boring you tell about neanderthals now I'm out of stuff to say about him. Anyway. No, I could go on for days. That's the problem. Things were not quite sure about exactly what I heard. That's what I do for a living. So I watch I to get back to the coupe but real quick. But Yo, it's funny as a

Speaker 2:          00:17:15       um,

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       how many, you probably don't know this, but how many people in the wildlife world listened to your show and get angry about it? Because I'm like a conduit. I, Joe, that that's not how it works. I'm like a conduit where I'm oftentimes getting frantic text messages is though I would be able to jump in and clarify like how a porcupine quill works or. Yeah. It's really funny how many people are here from what I can tell when you're on a. I know like when you're on the subject of wildlife, if there's marijuana in the room, we got a real issue with antlers or for. He should really know

Speaker 2:          00:17:58       who knows what antlers for other than. Well, there are two things, right? If there for fighting and sexual selection, right? Yeah. Two things that definitely makes sense. We in like a sexual display, we've got a bull in Utah, this, uh, this year and when we were butchering it, one of the hind quarters had been punctured by an antler and got infected and when we cut into the Hindquarter, just this bucket of pus came out. I mean it was fucking nasty. We thought it was pissed at first, like someone actually puncture the bladder. And then we realized when we got deep into it that there was just this giant has and he had been asked like literally right in the flank and it was just so fucking nasty.

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       Do you find really high pressure poss pockets in like

Speaker 2:          00:18:45       in animals all over his body. He had holes in his ribs. He had big one and his face had been jacked in the face.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       I got to seek a deer last year who had lost his eye completely gone. I mean like the desire ball had been punctured and people were asking me, well, no wonder you got them. But I was like, no. It was good. I was facing me on his line of approach. It didn't know where you were. Has left perception is a left I was facing me but yet with the cookbook, so we started gathering pictures up for it years ago, um, because I wanted to have this really complete idea of how to process everything. So like the book includes everything from how to process a bullfrog, you know, to a deer to pig to Mahi Mahi. And a problem I run into when I've done books is I never wind up needing. I never wind up needing a pad them in the end. I always might have having like very painful cuts. Yeah. You know, when I did my book, My book, American Buffalo member, I had to lose 100 pages, which was hard to do when we did the complete guide to hunting, butchering and cooking wild game. It came out at 700 pages.

Speaker 2:          00:20:01       Do you ever think of going back and putting those 100 pages back into. Do you think it made sense to remove it?

Speaker 1:          00:20:05       No. In hindsight had to happen. It had to happen in terms of like the narrative stuff I've written. That's the, you know, the narrative nonfiction I've written. That's my favorite thing that I've done and uh, it had to happen, but it was painful and we did, when I did those guidebook, the guidebook series that came in at 700 pages and my publisher was a, my publisher was like, you know, you just don't really make 700 page books. And so that's why we wanted to do another volume one and volume two because I didn't want to get rid of any. But then in doing this, this cookbook, the mediator fishing game cookbook is what it's called and putting this together. I think early on we started to get a little bit kind of running a little bit wild about what was going to fit but then caught it earlier.

Speaker 1:          00:20:49       But that was the first thing we did is we started collecting the pictures because I think a lot of times you look at a book, an illustrated book, and it kind of smells like a photo shoot. You know what I'm saying? Where you can tell that they get. They sort of how they got the images. And I didn't want to feel like that. I wanted it to sort of feel like really representative of so many different places and different experiences that are captured in here and so we just started filming his process shots of how to walk stuff through like everything, you know, how to like turn things, how to take an animal and make it into a variety of usable ingredients and collecting all those took a long time and then and then actually like assembling it and putting, putting it together was more systematic once we had that underway. But I think it's like it's cool looking. No, no, no. It's great. Like the book in the end where it's kind of like half could almost pass as a coffee table book. I agree.

Speaker 5:          00:21:48       Yeah. No, it really could. And I think it's a really valuable resource for people that hunt because it's just mean he was only so many different ways you can cook backstraps right? There's so many different ways you can put ground venison into spaghetti sauce, you know, you're giving people such a wide variety of things to include in your original books as well. A wide variety of things to, you know, to, to cook and ways to cook them. Well, it's one of the things I really enjoyed about your show, you know, um, and still do, but now that it's on Netflix, I actually, I enjoy it even more, but they, you do a lot of cooking on your show. Yeah. That's, that's very rare in the hunting world. You know, you see these hunting shows, they're very one dimensional, right? You see someone looking for the animal and then they finally get it and Yay, everybody's happy the end, but you, um, you spend a great deal of time, break it down animals and cooking a bunch of different things, including like marrow and shanks and unusual preparations. I think that's really important.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       Yeah, that's, that's something that was, that was always there for me growing up and hunting, fishing. Very complicated. And you do them for a bunch of reasons. I think that people in explaining hunting to audiences or explaining it to people who are uninitiated, uninformed about it, maybe adversarial toward it. You sort of, you wind up grabbing these things that you end up grabbing these things that, um, that you think will resonate with them. Right? I have a friend, Greg Blaskiewicz, who'd even worked on this research piece of taking justifications for hunting and finding test subjects who are skeptical of hunting and explaining various justifications to them and seeing which ones of those that they find to be most impactful. So he's actually done research around when you take this great, like these broad spectrum of reasons people do this, you know, and, and everyone that has many of them as part of their story, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:53       And, and you, you run them by people, he sees these ones that they really resonate and which ones kind of move the needle and their perception of it. And it's a little bit surprising. There's some, there's some surprises in there of ones that you think would be really impactful but in fact are not impactful at all that people don't care about. Like what? Well, population control people don't care people. I think that people don't. The kind of people you're talking about who are largely unfamiliar with it. But they're looking at it from the outside and they're skeptical of it. They have a hard. They don't buy it. I don't think that they're afraid of deer generally,

Speaker 5:          00:24:29       but people who live in high population areas. Like I did a Gig once in western Massachusetts. Well yeah, it was in western Massachusetts and I had a drive. I was coming from New York and I had to drive through the most dear infested place I've ever been to in my life. It was completely insane. Like when you're driving on the highway, you have to go 25, 30 miles an hour and things are just jumping in front of your car every 15, 20 seconds. It was fucking nuts, man. And I would. I took the side road down to get to wherever the Gig was and I'm just watching these animals jumping in front of the car, like left and right. And I'm like, these people that live here, these things are God damn nuisance. Like if this was your everyday reality and you ask those people, he said, hey, what do you think about deer population control? We need to hunt to keep the population down. They'd be like, fuck yeah, you do. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:25:21       I'm sure. I'm sure that there are quite a lot of people that live in some of these areas that have a great abundance of deer that feel that way. But with general population, yeah. When he was looking at it with just general population thing and it was full stop to. He didn't get. He didn't give a lot of. He didn't go in and give case scenarios and examples. Right. It's just a question that you ask and people. It didn't immediately click with people. Another thing that didn't immediately click with people, but it's extremely important to me is issues around heritage and legacy. Okay. So meaning that, um, my maternal grandfather, my paternal grandfather were hunters. My father was a hunter. I was brought up hunting, um, to anon. Hunter. Doesn't matter. Your grandparents and parents could have been involved in all kinds of bad shit.

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       I don't need that. That means you need to continue doing bad shit. I'm one that's very obvious is people understand, people understand and respect the idea of food. Like, uh, your general population, look and respect the idea of food now tobacco, what I was getting at about, you mentioned that being a big element of the show. Uh, it almost winds up being that it was like I was like fortunate or lucky or whatever that, that, that early in my career I started focusing on talking about that aspect of it. But it wasn't something I just made up out of because it was a huge part of growing up where for whatever reason I happen to be raised by a dad who was just really interested in cooking stuff and sharing with people, you know. And if he, if you're driving down the road in June and you see a snapping turtle laying eggs on the side of the road, it's come up out of a swamp and you needed to find some sandy ground and he finds it on the edge of a dirt road.

Speaker 1:          00:27:09       And there it is. Land, eggs on the side of the dirt road. We were eating that turtle right? And everything we ate, you know, all kinds of fish. And we had a lot of things that other people weren't interested in. We could go out and bring back our dad bullfrogs you would love if we went out and got them. Frogs. We take our bows out at night using flashlights, which unbeknownst to me was illegal and remains illegal in the state where I was brought up even for frog to use artificial light for frogs. Yeah. Wow. I had no dude when I found that out later. No idea. Wow. Um, the day that you weren't supposed to do that, where we would do it and we'd come in and bring them. And it was like a big thing, right? To bring her dad the frog legs and he would cook them and he would cook and eat anything.

Speaker 1:          00:27:48       And then he would do stuff where we would catch salmon when the salmon were running the rivers in October and he would have people over and we would have a salmon boil, you know? So I was raised around that stuff of, of celebrating wild game. Having to be very social, having to be a way to connect salmon. Boil. Yeah. Boiled fish. So you take your little, you're just, you're literally cubing up salmon and Pearl onions and little baby potatoes. Oh you. So you're making like a stew, a fish boil, and then you drain it off and you have drawn butter and you drown all that shit. And drawn butter. It's good. Sounds good. Yeah, it doesn't sound. We'll do fish boils. People do fish. Boyles was not normal to do a salmon boil. It seems like it's such a flavorful fish would lose some of that in the broth.

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       Yeah, for sure. But it's like when you. It's like when you have the Pearl onions and a little baby potatoes and cubed up and you drown all that shit and bought her. It's just like a thing. People like the taste is really good, but it's not necessarily the taste of salmon. It isn't. What if you went to great. If you went to the Pacific northwest and asked like a bunch of great chefs in the Pacific northwest to list their five favorite stamen preparations, boiling them in a pot of water isn't, isn't going to be on. Is it going to make their list? But he would do that, you know, and it'd be a thing and you'd invite people over to do it. So I kinda early at like early on with all the things I enjoyed about hunting, I'm like, the food aspect was big for me in really informed all of the sorts of conversations that I've had around it since.

Speaker 1:          00:29:25       And so then in doing a show about hunting wasn't something that was going to. It wasn't something that I was going to lean out. But in all fairness, when I was growing up, I did a lot of fur trapping too and trapped muskrats, beaver, mink, all kinds of stuff. And um, was doing that to sell the sell the furs. And I would use some of the meat out of you. Some of the meat for Bait at sometimes sell meat to dog sled racers. When did you realize that beaver were delicious? Not till after. I think I know the first one when I was in the first one I ever ate, I was in community college. I still tell people about the beaver that you cook for us and Wisconsin and how good it is. And they look at you sideways and Mike, I'm telling you, man, it was like the most delicious pot roast I've ever had was fantastic.

Speaker 1:          00:30:08       Yeah, it was really good. There's even stories about early on with the one early explorers are in this country. They had a difficult time getting fish sometimes. And beaver were approved for the lenten meal because they were aquatic. Yes. So on Fridays when you had to have, like when you're supposed to have your meat free day, you were allowed to eat beaver meat because they were a water animal. It was a very popular food item. You follow what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I get it. The first one, the first ones we ate, I had started reading about, I'd always read narratives, stories about the mountain men. Um, meaning like when I say mountain, like a very specific thing, like a, you know, a rocky mountain beaver trapper who was sandwiched between who is sandwiched in time between the end of the Lewis and Clark expedition and the collapse of the beaver market in the 1840 [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:31:04       So like they're a very finite period of time. Was what a mountain man was explained to people how big the market is because this is going to blow people's minds. Well, America's first asked her, John Jacob Astor, like the beaver market made America's first millionaires. His fortunes came from being a beaver trader. The, the richest men in the country. Their money came from beavers. Yeah. And he was in on the business end of it. He wasn't another trap and end of it. He was in on the habits for companies. Yeah. The big companies, like when we bought, think about like this, how big it was for us to do the Louisiana purchase and buy that chunk of land. Uh, when Lewis and Clark came out, part of their mandate was to suss out the potential for the trade and beaver hides.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       It'd be like buying some oil and gas. Right? You don't know it. Can we justify this? The oil and gas, they're looking to justify it through trade and beaver heights. Now also, there was also language about that. They might find out about whether wooly mammoth through existing out there as well. So there was some confusion about what was going on. Wow. They really thought that woolly mammoths were still alive. Jefferson was interested in that stuff because he had, he had been to some areas, uh, he had some familiarity and to some areas with these large bones and he was puzzled the bottom. He was wondering if this wasn't some, if it may be in fact was not an extinct species, but was somehow living in the American west still. How hard is it to the historians, like people, not historian, popular historians really loved to make a big deal out of that.

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       X is so weird, but it wasn't like, Hey, let's buy the, let's do the Louisiana purchase transaction because of the possibility of locating Mamet's. I think it was an idea that was floated around. People see it in a. people such as me see it and perhaps overemphasized what it meant. But it was an idea that was out there. The beaver trade stuff was certainly a big factor. Another thing I was reading about recently that just point out to your, to your, uh, that you might think is interesting is that we as people have this idea of Lewis and Clark going into this unspoiled uncontacted landscape. I was recently reading a piece by a historian who's talking about at the time of Lewis and Clark headed out into the great plains. There were native Americans living on the great plains who had been to Europe and met the King of France and returned back to the great plains.

Speaker 1:          00:33:33       What year they, they went out in the early 18 hundreds. So they're out in 18. Oh, four. Wow. You gotta if you imagine the time from the time I'm in the 15 hundreds when the Spanish. Right. We're poking around and come like Corn Otto, right. Coming up from Mexico into the great plains. Cabeza de Vaca being shipwrecked along the Gulf coast and people pushing up into these areas that was hundreds of years prior. Like the distance that separates. Imagine the distance. It's separated. Lewis and Clark from the first year peons who were doing activities in and around the great plains is like the distance and time that separates us from Lewis and Clark more so. Right? Yeah. It's the distance in time that separates us from the declaration of independence. It was like a long history of people messing around. Crazy. However. So yeah. But think about too, like Lewis and Clark were encountering people who had horses.

Speaker 1:          00:34:38       Right? Right. And those horses had been his horsemen traded up. So that is like a side note to this idea of eating beaver. So I got from reading about the mountain men. I got interested in this because you always do like anytime you read about mountain and you're going to find the part where the author talks about how much mountain men like beaver tail and the first people that tried and be retailing was around when I was. I was in community college at the time and my brothers, I remember stuck a b retail in the oven for awhile and cooked it and they reported back to me that like whatever it is they're talking about a isn't that like there must be some other explanation. Didn't we eat beaver tail? Yeah, yeah, we ate it and was constantly. We have a, there's a, there's a how to pictures and an explanation of how to prepare, how to actually prepare beaver tail mountain man style in the media. You're fishing game cookbook. It wasn't bad. It was a blend. It's just fat. It's so

Speaker 4:          00:35:39       after that we started thinking that when they say the mountain and like be retail, we thought it most amended like rump based, like the hind quarters. So we started when we went I would catch beavers. Um, I'd be careful when Skin Adam's not get the caster. The beavers have two large glands on the inside of their legs. They're like tucked in there. It looks like if you lay a beaver on its back, talked to kind of on either side of its of its like if it's a male I talked to you, your side of his penis or either side of it's Clo Eiko you'll. You'll see a, not waco but like vent. You'll see these. These glands that are the size of. I don't know if you make like a. If you take your index finger and your thumb and make a circle, there's like a gland on each side called the castor gland.

Speaker 4:          00:36:19       There's oil gland in there. They used to use it for perfume. It still has value today. It's used for a wide variety of things. It smells beautiful. If you ever walking on the stream bank and you smell like a strange perfume smell, it's usually beaver caster. Wow. Smells great. Tastes like shit. Tastes like you're eating. Like you rubbed roses or something all over your food. So started figuring out like to skin them and be very careful not to get the cast or on your knife or get the cast on your hands and then we would just take the meat and put it in crock pots with potatoes and onions and stuff and just cook them down in a crock pot. You could pick them and it was like roast beef. So when I started eating that, but I still. Then later I realized that the read other accounts of how people are prepared be retail and if you take the tail like the scaly ass tail and it really should be from a fall, beaver, [inaudible] the tail would be twice as thick in the fall.

Speaker 4:          00:37:10       Then in the spring or a macerated in the spring, take the tail into skewered on a stick and put it next to a fire where the skin starts to bubble and boiled away and pretty soon you can just peel that skin away and was hiding under. There is the the best equivalent, like the best equivalent or point of comparison that I can think of would be to just. It's like if you had a really like imagining you're getting a grass fed steak, right, but still has that fatty gristle on it. It's just made up of that gristle like what allow people to trim away from mistake and not eat. That's what's inside that beavertail, but people eat these individuals that we're doing this for fat starved eating such lean meat all the time. I think they loved it because here's like a chunk of fat, you know, and they had ready access to it because they catching them to make a living and if you're just eating the meat, there's no fat on the meat. And so they would compliment it with just eating the beavertail fat and I'll often tell people about it and I even gave some to the. There's like a, a culinary arts institute and I gave some chefs that stuff and everyone who eats it points out there's not that it tastes so fantastic, but just like really interesting to try and eat it. The fat from the tail. And it's like you've got to put yourself in position. You've probably been in this too where if you're, especially if you're out hunting and eating

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       freeze dried food or not eating great and you're just exerting yourself all day all the time, how you're, what you want to eat changes a lot. Yeah. And you the level of appetite. I was off the charts. Yeah. And so just like to eat like a big slab of fat, it'd be very excited. It was appealing to people. Yeah. Your, your body starts craving things that absolutely needs. Yeah, that makes sense. Makes Sense. In particularly when you think about these people that are hiking across the west, traveling massive amounts of distance and you know, probably very physically strenuous dragon, all their shit with them and they get a cross some big ass piece of fat from a tail. It's probably a huge treat. Yeah. And then our understanding of people like we used to have this idea of like, especially of early native Americans is like, they're like just eating, you know, nothing but mammoth meat and all the time, like as our understanding of people grows, you see like how much they are utilizing plant resources and probably had like pretty plant rich diets.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       But with the one with the equestrian bison hunters on the great plains, those guys were. They weren't cultivating at that era like especially the era when Lewis and Clark came in. These people, we're not cultivating crops. A lot of the people who had been farming along the Mississippi and Missouri Valleys, once they got horses, they just gave up on that shit and just started Roman landscape eaten meat and the mountain men certainly weren't doing that. They were just eating like you're eating meat 365 days out of the year and you see that they really probably to make up for a lot of nutrient deficiencies. Eight shitloads. Oregon's your guy, the gall putting Gol on your food, gallbladder, squeezing, taking the garb, the putting, squeezing the bile from gallbladder on your food. You did that once. Yeah, it's horrific. Yeah. Well they put a nine volt battery on your tongue and you think they were doing just because they were just nutrient starved?

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Yeah, it seems like they, they, they put a high emphasis on eating just like all these, like just organ meats, organ meats, milk from milk, from mammary glands. Really? Yeah. Because you can't just eat that. Leanne ass gave me every. Right. You were talking to a guy from Alaska. What's that guy's name? Buck. Buck. Buck Bowden. No, on your show. And he was talking about um, you know, essentially he was subsistence hunting in certain stages and you know, he ate nothing but Moose, like he shot a moose and ate nothing but that Moose for months and pick and wolverine and eat off the skulls. And so I whoa know, you know, so fucking modern day human who's alive right now talking about only surviving on the leanest of lean meat. You know, like I had to be skinny as fuck when that was all over and I would mess with that guy.

Speaker 1:          00:41:26       He's tough shit, dude. Yeah. He, he lived the life he lived a life that seems like he had parts of his life that seemed like was 100 years. Yeah, it could have occurred 100 years earlier. He, uh, the episode of the podcast is like, you're a good man. Fuck. Is that what it's called? You're cool dude. Cool Dude. Buck, which is body mind says to him in the shower, you know, he's a cool dude. It's, it's a treat to get a chance to talk to a guy that you think probably never even fucking heard of a podcast, uh, and certainly comes from a completely different era. The reason he was living had to live off the land is an interesting story where he was working for. He was just getting into the guiding world, so guiding Moose hunters and they were wanting to find some ways to be able to hunt some very remote areas and they hidden in us the idea that they would just bring horses in because if you don't have landing strips and stuff is just really hard to operate out of these areas.

Speaker 1:          00:42:17       So they thought, well, if we can get horses in there, we'll have them in there, will want for the season. Then we'll ride the horses out. But getting the horses in there, it was so difficult. It took far longer. The route they wanted to use was impassable. By the time they got the horses in there, they realized that they're never going to get these horses back Outta here and they realize that someone needs to stay over winter to take care of the horses and he has volunteered to do it. So he started spending. They would go in and hunt in September and then he would just start hanging out and just stay there to agree to care for the horses until spring. So that's how he found himself living out by himself. And they would bring some food in, but it would be never enough and he would be eating wolverine, beaver, Moose, whatever he could come up with.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       But he was just, um, he was just open to it and didn't care and was really comfortable with solitude when I spend time with him, he's very gracious. But um, when he spent time with them, you see him just engage in conversation. You see a, uh, a, a sort of weariness kick in where you're talking to someone who's very comfortable going months without human interaction. Right? So him talking to people like, okay, that's enough, let me get the fuck out of house. And you realize like when I've stayed at his place, his cabin and he's got, he's got a remote cabins stolen when I stayed out there. You kinda like, we'll sort of drift off and vanish for good spells. Sure. Even when he's, even when he's like entertaining, you know, and he sells bowls like wooden bowls for living. Well, it's one of the things that he does have one of those bowls.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       I have one in my home now. I need to get one of those bowls. Birch. Yeah. It's like a, you know, it's like a salad bowl. So like a growth on the side of a birch tree that you cut off with a chainsaw and hollow out. Know they call them Birch Birch Bark or burl? Both. Yeah. Yeah. I have a beautiful one. And he sells and they go into terrorists shops. I think it's a shame that they go into tourist shops. Yeah, I think he should be. It should be all be direct consumer. Well from him. Why don't you hook it up? Taking zero point zero people on the case

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       gauge some of your meat. Meat Eater.

Speaker 1:          00:44:34       Yeah. He had a great many of the lost in a fire too. Yeah, that was a sad story. But besides. Yeah. So he's still guides and um, does that and makes his uh, you know, takes some time

Speaker 2:          00:44:45       Berles and makes bowls out of him. Just talking to a guy like that. Listening to you talk to a guy like that is so fascinating because he lives a life that I can barely comprehend. Just everything about it from.

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       And just to think that,

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       well, what he does is almost impossible to comprehend now think about Lewis and Clark making their way across the country and not really knowing what was out there really not knowing like, guessing, having some people gave some reports. This is what we saw here. This is what we saw there. They didn't even have a good account of all the different animals.

Speaker 1:          00:45:19       No, they had won or lost. And that's the thing we were talking about this point. There are days we're talking about like what people now you'll hear people say like, oh, he's a real mountain man. You know? And oftentimes when people hear that they imagined this old hermit, yeah. You know, who's living in his cabin, um, him being a mountain man. But if you think about what the mountain men were, they were for the time, the most well traveled people, right? And the least. Zena phobic people alive. The equivalent today to be a mountain man today, the equivalent would be, I think you'd have to go to, um, presuming and ascend the Amazon and follow tributary after tributary and get into like the borderlands around Venezuela and then go in and despite the language barrier, you'd have to go in and travel amongst and live amongst people who, um, tribes who had not had a lot of outside contact but had a familiarity, had a familiarity with outside peoples and you'd live there foods you eat their foods and live with them and take their ways that they dress themselves and adopted as your own.

Speaker 1:          00:46:42       The kind of guy that would do that is not the kind of guy we're talking about nowadays when we talk about. He's a real mountain man, right? We're talking about reality show people that people talk about now. But these people were like insatiably curious explorers. They're the people now, the people that do like go to really crazy war zones or like decided to go backpack up in the Hindu Kush and Afghanistan, you know, just see what happens. Um, yeah, very different kinds of people.

Speaker 2:          00:47:16       Your episodes that you did, what? Where, where was that in with the most recent series where your boat fishing with these people?

Speaker 1:          00:47:26       Yeah, down in Guyana. Diana. Yeah. That's a. that's got to be a trip. How long were you down there for? Oh look, you know, long weeks. Couple of weeks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, but there's a lot of travel. There's a lot of stuff needs to happen to get out on the river, but when you're around these people and they're all walking around barefoot and they're making cassava, which we talked about the other day, that it could easily kill you if you do it wrong. The water as all this cyanide in it, like you're, you're about as close as you can get to that kind of environment. Right? Yeah. What you're in a situation like that you with people who are very familiar with, like where are you familiar with the modern world? Like a great awareness of it, but like when the, when the rubber meets the road of daily existence, they're still really connected to life patterns and skillsets that were, that their grandparents used and still fishing like a very similar ways. Right. So

Speaker 4:          00:48:28       where you might've had, when you were a boy lehman is someone now is in their thirties, when they were a boy, they probably use a 12 pound handmade wooden paddle and maybe now they have a different paddler. Maybe somehow they've come into, you know, a plastic paddle say and they use that for their boat or they have a, they still have a dug out canoe, but they also have an aluminum boat. So there's major differences. But just the general sort of approach and the fact that you're deriving all of your protein from the river and that you hunt and fish 250 300 days a year in the places where your ancestors have always done it. You're still, you're still gaining this really beautiful glimpse at how people lived. Even though they've had enormous changes in their own lifetime and are very much modern, you know, very modern, but you can still like glimpse it more. You don't. I don't think you really get that as much.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       You don't get that as much here. You know, hunting is his ancestral. Right, and there's this kind of continuation that goes on. But when Europeans came here, when, when Europeans came to the new world, they weren't coming in as hunters. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:49:45       If you have to go look like Daniel Boone's family, Dana Boone's family came from England. They didn't come here as hunters because you could like the peasantry you couldn't hunt there. They came here and learned hunting. So hunting and America for Euro Americans, hunting and America is like an invention. It's a thing that people kind of got to learn and took from the Indians. So it doesn't have a. It doesn't have that. Like that deep deep thread that you'd find with indigenous communities where there's. This continuation has gone on for forever on broken, but on this continent unbroken for whatever, 15, 16, whatever the fashionable number is thousands of years.

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       Right. And so it's like our understanding is different because our, like my ancestors came here and got into it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       It wasn't a, it wasn't a cultural continuation for them. And then when you look at like for, for food and wild game. And an interesting thing is my, uh, my use and understanding of wild game is really influenced by like contemporary food, right? Like, like restaurant food, things that chefs do. Like how do you take wild game and do these like cool, exciting, modern, innovative kinds of things with, with wild game and cook it, you go talk to her like a dude, even though dude like Bach or particularly people in people in South America who have, have haunted for more of a, like a subsistence literally subsistence purposes. Their whole attitude is different about it. People like people in South America will eat that. Like the, the Chimani or the Macuna is like they'll eat the same thing every day for lunch, everyday

Speaker 1:          00:51:34       boiled fish with a dried pepper on it. And then a grain made from cassava boiled as well, why is he a grain? But like a dish made from cassava. Why they boiling it? Why, why don't they just grill it? They, they, they sometimes do. But for lunch it's like you take leftover. You might, you'd probably like smoked with. Were they able to call barbecue fish where you make a big rack, you have a fire and make a big rack high above it, it kicks off a bunch of smoke. You split fish, salt, lamb on that rack and smoke them, dry them out, and then you take that fish and break it apart and poor river water over cassava. Um, and then put fish in there with river water and kind of stir it up or you just take fish and throw it in a pot and boil it and put that on there.

Speaker 1:          00:52:19       But to eat that same thing every day. Then you come and talk about, uh, there's no recipe, there's no like written preparation and then you come and talk about like wild game cook is. I understand that where you make a book and it's got 100 different recipes and, and all these ways to approach stuff. It's just like it's very particular to us, like other people aren't really perceiving it that way, like they don't use wild game and recipes. They have like a, there's like, here's how you cook this and we don't really deviate from cooking this way where it's like fish on a rack over to fire or efficient, a pot of water and very limited diet.

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       Does it weird you out when you're around people like that because you have options, right? You can, you can eat any way you like. You can go to a restaurant, you get a burger from fast food, you choose to go hunting with these people. It's literally how they survive and there's no option. There's no options and they've been doing it that way forever. Like is it, do you feel like a weird recreational sort of person around them? Like is it. Does it feel?

Speaker 1:          00:53:26       That's a great question man. I'm no, there's definitely, there's definitely like an, an envious part two how to live that deliberately. Like I'm a little bit envious of it, but really the thing that I feel most, I feel I'm more than separated. I, I tend to feel more of the areas in which I'd be like aligned, you know, where like appreciate the perspective and I appreciate the skill set but never feeling, um,

Speaker 1:          00:54:04       yeah, never feeling like, like a fuller ashamed or something that this would be something that I would choose to engage in and this is something that they were engaged in and I think they're, one of the things that helps make it that way is how much they love to do it. Right. That when you go out, like the infectious excitement of heading out in the morning, the fact that they still feel it. Like there is Giddy is anybody about going out and doing it, like very excited to go out and do it. It is not like going out to get your, like to get you to check your mailbox.

Speaker 2:          00:54:38       My uh, my youngest daughter has become enamored with fishing and I love it because I get to, whenever we go on trips, I take her fishy, fucking loves it man. And we were in Florida and we're going to get to go bass fishing. I set it up. Had a guy who was going to take us out. I woke her up 5:00 in the morning in the hotel. I'm carrying her. She's stiff as a board because she just woke up. She's like, I'm so excited. She was so excited. She wasn't like, Daddy, I'm tired. Can we just go back to bed now? It was dark out five in the morning. She's just calling. I'm so excited that you want to have fun. She caught it six pound bass. Then she's hooked. She's got quite a few bass. It was a great lake in in Florida, in Florida.

Speaker 2:          00:55:19       Obviously a lot of great bass fishing there, but we caught a ton of large mouth bass and she caught up fat boy. It was like a six pounder. She was freaking yet had bit her finger. She was showing everybody look at bit my finger. She was so excited. She fucking loves fishing, but that feeling in the morning when I'm looking at her little face and like we're on the water, like it's a genetic thing. It seems like it's just in the DNA. The fishing is. It's not like, hey, we're going to go play soccer, which she likes to, but there's not that kind of excitement. Now there's like, oh, there's gonna be so fun. There's like, it's triggering something that is deep inside human beings. I see it and I see it in.

Speaker 1:          00:56:02       I see it in varying degrees and in different people. Like some kids seem to come out of the box with more of it. Yeah. You know? Yeah. My own. I don't mean that as a euphemism.

Speaker 2:          00:56:12       No, it might. My 10, 10 year old daughter doesn't. She's like, yeah, we can go fishing. Like she's gone fishing and stuff. It's okay. It's okay. When

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       I, when, when we had a daughter, my wife

Speaker 4:          00:56:24       was adamant, you know, early on, soon as she found out what it was gonna be a daughter like that, you will not exclude our daughter in this world that you're in. I was like, oh, of course not. You know, and I, and I don't. But uh,

Speaker 4:          00:56:41       having in my mind, I don't feel like I've messed this up. I feel like I've put the same emphasis right on my. I have three kids, but my older two, I'm the little one just a little bit too little yet to really know what's going on, but the old chair, I feel like I put the same emphasis on it and my daughter just isn't demonstrating the same enthusiasm that her older brother does. And you and you try to suss out like the nature nurture question because I feel like I'm doing the same inputs. Right. But I'm getting different results and it leads you to wonder, um, you know, it's a very small sample size, but when I talked to other parents, like parents who are parenting right now, young kids, I just keep encountering other dads who are having the same experience and it really leads you to wonder, sort of like what sort of cultural influences are going on there, where it's like the enthusiasm oftentimes among young girls are not as high as the enthusiasm among bugs.

Speaker 2:          00:57:46       It's hard to unpack. I don't know. It's hard to unpack everything. Yeah, that's, that's my question is I don't know how old your kids, while the two on talking about are eight and five. Yeah, man, I don't know how much culture plays a part. I know, I really think that it's, and it's obviously in my small sample group and eight year old and a 10 year old for the youngest kids, the uh, the eight year old fucking loves it. They're both girls, the 10 year old, she's like, whatever, you know, if I tried to wake her up, take her fish and she'd be like, leave me alone. I'm going back to sleep.

Speaker 4:          00:58:17       I'm sure there are parents out there who, you know, I haven't met him yet. Maybe they're out there where they have like a boy and a girl and the girls fired up and the boys not maybe

Speaker 2:          00:58:27       I guarantee you there's, Jamie and I were just talking about this yesterday because I was watching this video of these. There's, I want to try to put this in a respectful way. Um, I think they're, I'm sure you're aware of this. There's people that are in the hunting world, the outdoor industry that I think are in it because it's a good avenue to get attention. If you're like a hot chick. Yeah. If you're a hot check and you know you wear pink and you go out and shoot things, you take all these grip and grins with deer and you're gonna get a lot of likes. Yeah. Because it's.

Speaker 4:          00:59:05       Imagine the, the male perspective on it. Yeah. It's like here's the woman who has everything.

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       Exactly. And she likes to hunt. Yeah. She's hot and she likes to hunt and there's quite a few of them and it's. I was telling Jamie, it's a weird world because part of me, I don't want to be a sexist. I don't want to look at these girls and I mean I don't. I don't look at a guy who hunts and who wants to be a part of the outdoor industry and go, Oh, this guy is just doing this because he thinks this is his avenue for fame and success. I think, well, here's a guy who really likes to hunt and he realizes there's people like Steve Rinella and John Dudley out there and these famous haunters man, I want to be a famous hunter. How do I do it? How do I go? Well, I'm going to just start taking instagram pictures and say a lot of the same shit that they say and sort of put myself into the cultural norm. I don't think like that with girls

Speaker 1:          00:59:58       because you're like, you just want to.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       Not all of them, a lot of them I think are super legit. A lot of. But there's unquestionably this added element in that world and it with it. Let's be super generous and say it's only 10 percent of them, but that 10 percent of my smell a rat.

Speaker 1:          01:00:18       I'm not unaware of what you're talking about. Sharing. You know? I notice it. Yeah. Yeah. I even had like A. Yeah, I remember was. Yeah, it is Kinda like A. Yeah, like a, like a, like, like a sex pot kind of hunters scene, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:00:35       Super made up full war paint, fake eyelashes. Hot as fuck. Skin tight clothes out there. Shooting Shit. Taking pictures. Yeah. It's weird. And then you go to their instagram page and it's like there's pictures of that and then there's a lot of pictures with their butt up in the air where they're doing some strange exercise. Getting ready for both things and accentuating there, but like, that's weird. I don't do any of those exercises.

Speaker 1:          01:00:59       I really liked you. I know I would really like to because I'm going to continue leaning on my own to continue leaning on my daughter because I would really like her.

Speaker 1:          01:01:12       I want to keep leaning on her and so I feel like she's in the ad age or she can legitimately say she doesn't want to go. Right. Because right now if I asked her everyday, hey you want to go to school, she'd be having real delinquency problem. So you're like, you know, you really like a, you make kids do stuff. I took her duck on a couple of weekends ago and it was cold morning and we get out there and before it's even legal light, she's felt terrible. She's laying there crying about colder feet are. If my boy was doing that, I would have a very different attitude about it. Then when she's crying her crank and she's cold,

Speaker 1:          01:01:53       like made me feel awful with my boy. I've been like, suck it up for her. I'm like, Oh man, she's all cold now. Yeah, and then it makes it so you really, there really is a difference. Yeah, there's, there's a, there's a difference there and it's not, you know, the people that buy a hunting license in this country, 90 percent of people by hunting, 90 percent are males, right? Right. So one in 10 license holders is a woman, but then there's, there's more women than men in the slightly more men women than men in the country and there's a ton of ways of explaining it. We talked about earlier with neanderthals or maybe an inner falls didn't have these divided roles, but in all the hunter in hunter gatherer cultures is very normal to see a division of labor here and to have like the men were out hunting and women, we're not.

Speaker 1:          01:02:45       There's a bunch of explanations for that. Like people were tied to being home to care for small children and you know, couldn't afford that risk to something. Do they vary? There's some women that go out with the hunting parties, you know, if it is, I mean, you know, the minute you say no, someone was going to point out to some right. Variation, but in your experience, you've, you've done several of these trips to these remote jungles. Oh yeah. But that's just, that's such a small thing. I mean, you get a, rather than looking at personal experience just from kind of exploring literature and reading about historic accounts and what people found in what people do, uh, it is very much the norm is very much the norm that hunting was, you know, patrilineal descent activity in all these cultures. You go to like the cult of the hunter is like a male sort of coal, but the factors that made it that way.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       Okay. The sort of the, you you have to assume it comes from some kind of practical factor. Right? The factors that made that way aren't there anymore. And I said it's a difficult thing to unpack if it winds up being that if I have two boys and one girl winds up being that, uh, both boys become avid hunters and fishermen and somehow my daughter does not. I'll probably view it as some bit of a personal failure. I'll never know what really was going on. Like I said, it's hard to like unload it. I wish I could have 100 children like 50 girls and 50 boys and have a bigger samples, but I, you know, I do wonder about it and what's funny too is there's no, like at our home, our kids are, our kids eat tons of wild game at our home to the point where they don't have any.

Speaker 1:          01:04:33       You could give them anything to eat. They would eat it and it would not register to them is unusual. They've eaten everything right. They've even eaten breakfast sausage made out of Fox and beaver meat. They've eaten Fox. Yeah, they've eaten everything. Wait a minute. Yeah. You Eat Fox a half. I made a batch of breakfast sausages because I had an Arctic Fox one time and I made breakfast sausage out of it. What was that like? I just caught it in with beaver meat, a little bit. Deer meat and a little bit of pork fat. My kids ate it and then every wink you try any of the Fox on its own? Nope. Didn't try the Fox on its own. I've seen a ton of things, but I didn't eat just straight old possessed you to stuff that Fox into that sausage. I heard that they were good and I had an Arctic Fox and I wanted to get a thing made if my wife from it.

Speaker 1:          01:05:22       So I had a hat, the Arctic Fox hat made for and then I retained the meat and then we just ate the meat and breakfast sausage and then like if I told him, you know, if they were to ask like what meat it is now I would say, oh, it's know this, this and this. It wouldn't freak them out. It wouldn't, it wouldn't even know. It wouldn't even register as like a, a thing that might seem unusual to some people. So the squirrel rabbit all manner stuff, right. The just anything. And so I know there's no element of, there's no influence like that with them. There's no influence of, oh that's gross or you, that's weird. You know, their day we were hunting the other day we went out and we're hunting street pigeons, you know, and they'll eat pigeon meat. And where were you doing this? In Montana.

Speaker 1:          01:06:08       Oh, okay. Yeah. Uh, there's like a guy at a grain silo that was infested with pigeons. Folks don't know that many people listening to this, that pigeons were actually brought over here as food. And when you get like fancy squad on the menu, that's what a pigeon is. No flightless pigeon pigeon hasn't flown yet. That's what a squad is. So smaller and younger. That's the idea. Yeah. The meats, pinkish on the meats, pinkish on squad if you want to get squad. But we used to go out and catch squads where we had, we had like a little, almost like the equivalent of a little trap line where they would, uh, you know, Nasa and various places around town and we would just know all the places to go check to get squabbles. And yeah, it's one that hasn't flown yet. So, but you know, people that commercially produced squad, you can just keep them from flying. But if you want squad from the wild, you need to go out and you know, you just go and collect them. And what's the difference between pigeon and squad in terms of the way it taste? Pigeon meat is tougher. Grayer,

Speaker 1:          01:07:09       uh, has more livery quality and squad is like very tender pinkish, like it's lean. It's not like quail, but it's leaning way more in the direction of quail. Like it'd be like if a pigeon in a quail had a baby squads more like that. It's, it's one of the biggest surprises I had in. That was one of the biggest surprises that I've ever had in, in game. What if we can count that as wild game would be what a squad tasted like because I had been eating it for a long time. Eating Street pigeons because no street pigeons, you know, they're around even up in the Missouri breaks, you got street pinch that nest up in the, in the cliffs and you know, you can, you, there's many places you can hunt street pigeons and they become a agricultural past and they're not regulated. So there's no closed season, no bag limit, right?

Speaker 1:          01:08:07       They're treated like they have no more regulated. Like rats. If you could talk to wildlife managers and ask them if they could wave a magic wand and make street pigeons go away. Most everybody would waive it because they're so costly. They're costly to cities. They're costly to agriculture. Um, so I'd always eat and pigeons, but the minute of discovering, discovering like what a squad was like, which is well known to people in the fine dining, but I had never had it. It was shocking how good it is. That's interesting. I've never picked it off the menu, but now I'm tented. Yeah, you should do it. But street pigeon. Should I avoid that? No. I would eat something first just to test it and make lattes from it. Okay. But it's not something that you would go, this is one of my favorite things to eat. No.

Speaker 1:          01:08:50       Is there a way to do it where you could really like, is there a preparation maybe that you've missed? It's not bad to, to put it in a marinade and you can grill it. You know what? You want to take little brass and you poke it whole bunch, like poke it with a fork and tenderize a little bit and also make some like avenues of approach for the marinade and grill them over. Very hot flame. Um, but what was good is like to use it like similar to like stuff with Ptarmigan or whatever is to make patties and Tureens Ptarmigan is something that you would cook that way as well. I've only seen people do Ptarmigan on that, uh, with sexual called life below zero. So a lady who lives, she's been on the show before, she lives like fucking hell. What does she live like 200 miles above the arctic circle. Something crazy like that. And she hunts Ptarmigan up there. The best time I've ever eaten in this is we, this is in, in our new cookbook too, but I mentioned using Ptarmigan for it, but it's just a, a dish that's great for regular, like any, any kind of meat particularly gamers is like you have, you have, you had hot pot. Yeah. Where you like, where you have the, you know, you have like the simmering broth. And you have all these raw like raw sliced meats that you dip in there.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       The best timing I've ever had is like that. Hmm. It's, it's other worldly, you know, it's just kinda like, like Kinda like when you slice it thin and cooked that way I just kind of vanishes on your tongue. It's a very, very tender meat. You can almost kind of mash it up. People like a thing you hear with a lot of gamers. People described harm. Again, treat street pigeon, lot of game birds people describe as livery diving, ducks being livery because it was like a texture thing to it. And in the strength of flavor, in a darkness of color. Um, and those people make a lot of pathways. Liver, right? So those birds that have that quality, oftentimes they just, they can find their way into patties. So we also have recipes for that. Like how to do pat taste from using all, all manner of meat.

Speaker 1:          01:10:58       Do you have any recipes in the book for Brown bear? No, but we have bare recipes. Is there a difference? You know, Brown, black bears are among people who know blackbirds are widely accepted as being good to eat. If you go into, if you go to earlier I mentioned Daniel Boone's, so if you go into that, like the frontier era of American history, right? Which proceeded just these little lingo terms. The frontier era of American history proceeded the mountain man era of American history with like the eastern settlements, right? Um, if you read it like about Daniel Boone's area, you know, early 17, hundreds up into, uh, you know, open to the revolutionary war. Bear me was the most popular meet on the frontier. Black bears. The most popular is in preferred, preferred over venison. Really? Yeah. People hunted deer to sell deer hides and they would eat the deer meat.

Speaker 1:          01:11:56       People want to barriers to that. That's what they like to eat late. So there's more beef like, you know, and you know, when cooked right? People love bear meat, a brown bears. Grizzly bears just don't enjoy the same reputation. Um, different diets. One run in with Brown when we use it, when we use the term Brown, like brown bear is kind of almost like a, like a. it's used amongst hunters a lot, but it is all. It's all one species, so whether you've got a grizzly bear in Wyoming or a brown bear on Kodiak taxonomically, it's regarded as as a single species. People Call Brown bear. Brown bear is a grizzly. You'll get all kinds of people. Right, and you to say this about various points of this book, like debating various aspects of this. A brown bear is a grizzly with access to marine resources were marine resources make up a major component of it's diet and then the question you bring up is then like if you go to the north slope, so if you go to the Arctic coast and you saw a grizzly there, you'd be like, well, he has access to marine resources.

Speaker 1:          01:13:04       He can eat a beached whale, whatever, but he's a grizzly. So like brown bears kind of extend right from northern BC up around and Hook around into the bering sea, but at some point they're just not brown bears anymore and there he, they tend to be big and, and oftentimes because of the name, like the tend to have like a darker coloration, they have a horrible reputation is food. You'll always find people who will point it out, right. Or nowadays because people are so aware, like in the social media world nowadays, you'll have people that will kill a brown bear and here you are, you've got four or 500 pounds of meat and they'll talk about how they're going to eat it. But like dude, you're in for a pound a day this year. Really? Is that really what happened for real? Is that really what happened?

Speaker 1:          01:13:55       That's true. Right? And then there's no salvage requirement on it. Uh, there was no salvage requirement on it. Don't you have to in Alaska? Don't you have to pack it out? Depends, there's some areas that have zero. Some areas you know, typically typically no, but there are areas that do have salvage requirements where I have a cabin, there's a salvage requirement on bear meat in the spring because in areas where bears. So that's a black but yours, your cabin is that there? It's island by island, so somehow like the ABC islands, like, like you know you go to Admiralty Islands in Admiralty Islands is all brown bears, so it winds up being that if the island is good brown bear habitat, it will only have brown bears because on the islands where it's smaller, they just would kill all the blackberries. They're there and blackbirds aren't there. If the island is not brown bear habitat and can't support brown bears, it will become a black bear island.

Speaker 1:          01:14:54       Prince Wales is a black bear island, Admiral Tom Brown, bear island and you know, it kind of depends on how much seems to maybe depending on how much like open country or Alpine or you know, if it's like densely densely forested, it's less suitable and becomes a black bear territory. But black bears in the spring have a salvage requirement because if you're talking about coastal bears, coastal bears are better to eat in the spring when they're not eating tons of rotten salmon in the fall. There wouldn't be a salvage requirement because when they're eating dead salmon, their flesh can become not good. I remember you telling me a story about using the guy smoker and he told the guy, man, you need to clean that smoker out. Smells like fish. He's like, I've never cooked efficient [inaudible] you. You were smoking a barren it. Yup. And that was a. That was an early June in early June.

Speaker 1:          01:15:45       Blackberry, who's not getting salmon, but it's just. It stores up that that flavor stores on their fat. I've watched even woves eating salmon that were so rotten that they're like lapping it up where it just turns into a grey Bush into the bears and people's idea of a bear is like eating a brand new fresh fish, which they love to do and they seem to prefer it. Like when there's tons of fresh fish and they're just getting fresh fish, they'll just eat eggs. Right? But as the fish run dies down, they just start eating rotten fish. Um, I can't remember how we got to talking about quality food. Oh, were you asking? So even like Mark Bowden's Buck Bowden, who, like I said, he's picked the head meat off of Wolverine skull to eat it, but bowden and said he struggled his entire life. Um, and just hasn't found a way to make brown bears that good. There are exceptions. People run into good taste in one's the, you know, I was talking about like, grizzlies up on the north slope have a very good reputation. Any black bear in the rockies, any is good. I mean, I've heard stories like I had a body that kill one over a dead cow one time he killed and it was scavenging a rotten cow and he had a hard time with the meat. But generally

Speaker 1:          01:17:02       bears that aren't eaten, marine resources are pretty, are phenomenally good.

Speaker 5:          01:17:09       Talk to my friend Eric Weinstein yesterday. He's a mathematician. One of the smartest guys I know. And uh, he is been fascinated by my obsession with hunting. And so he started watching a bunch of hunting things online and he said he was very put off. I saw people killing bears with spears and celebrating and the way they were celebrating about stuff. He's like, you found the thing, the whole thing, I, you know, and I saw his point and we had this discussion about it where, um, you know, acknowledging the need to control the population and that this is all that they're allocated a certain amount of tags by wildlife biologist and this keeps the moose population healthy and the deer population, oh, all these different things. And even that people eat them. All those things made sense to him. But the celebration and the all the hooting and hollering and stuff, he's like, there was just not enough of a reverence for the dead. And it really, really disturbed them.

Speaker 1:          01:18:07       Yeah, that's, it's a great subject and it's hard to. It's hard to approach because. So you find so many contradictions in weird parts of it. And by that I mean this, I was having a conversation tonight with a gentlemen over dinner and we're talking about. He was explained to me what is the role of a rancher and what is the role of farmer? Here's the person who's bringing animals into life. He's propagating breeding animals with the sole intention that they will all die and he will make his living off of their death, but that person remains a sort of cultural icon. They enjoy like a celebration. You know when you're trying to sell, sell a pickup truck, right? If you can tie it to a rancher, it makes that pickup trucks. He more legitimate that celebrated character and be like, oh, he's an old cowboy.

Speaker 1:          01:19:08       Yeah, and we like that. It's like, what does it. Not that I'm definitely not knocking them. Let me get where I'm going with this, but what is that like? That person is based off of like rearing animals in order that they may die and he profits from their death and remain celebrated and then you get into the idea of what? In a way, when it comes to American wildlife where we have a population of wildlife, many respects we have it and enjoy the management that we do and the abundance that we do in many ways that abundance is supported, bolstered, financed by hunters, but hunters tend to not enjoy that same cultural support because of the death.

Speaker 5:          01:20:01       Well, it's also because of media depictions. Sure. I think that's the big part of it. More than even so than the if are.

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       If all of our depictions about hunting, we're tied into this sort of rational discourse and they showed all the images from your show of animals being shot and carefully butchered in the field and then prepared and cooked and enjoyed. I think people would have a way, different perception, but we have elmer fudd and we have the evil hunters and the movies that are always trying to torture the animals. I mean it's, it's Disney and anthropomorphization of these animals and all these different films and media depictions and books that Shit and then teddy bears all these things. They're like stained into people's brains of what's good and what's bad. You know, very few kids have stuffed cows that their pets are, that their toys, they have teddy bears and maybe rudolph the red nose reindeer. You don't want to shoot Rudolph.

Speaker 4:          01:20:59       No. It seems to. It seems that it gets much worse and more contentious. The less the pop. If the American population is looking at something that they recognize as game, they feel different things that they don't recognize this game that they don't readily recognizes game to see that death is more abhorrent to them even if it is being treated as game, but like you don't like you, you don't see social media explosions come up around someone with a Turkey, right? You don't see a lot of social media explosions come up with someone around a white tail. Deer. People look at that. They see this animal that they perceived to be very abundant in the case of white tails and Turkeys are correct, very abundant. They're familiar with them. They're familiar with the idea of these things being haunted and it feels different. Now, if there's things where there's a perceived scarcity,

Speaker 3:          01:21:52       okay,

Speaker 4:          01:21:55       and they don't immediately recognize it as a food item, it's hard for them extremely in this is way outside of my personal area of expertise, but why like what goes on in Africa, but for people to see animals in Africa that had been hunted and they recognize them only from like

Speaker 4:          01:22:15       film depictions, cartoon depictions, mobiles over their child's Crib, like, like a hippopotamus is very like, you can't look at that and it's hard to see that as like the harvest of game. It becomes something very different and it's. We've watched it happen with bears, you know? Also a thing that will happen is if you initiate the hunting of something that wasn't hunted before, that's very difficult for people. So you take a state where like New Jersey or Florida where they for a long time historically they would have a bear season. They would lose the bear, so the bear sees would go away because of a, of a resource scarcity. Then later they would recover the resource in want to reinitiate the hunt. People have very difficult time with that being like

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       if it wasn't hunted before, how can it be hunted now? Right, and that trips people up really bad where they people have are hard to get on board with it. If you watch what's going on with grizzly bears around what has been unfortunately named the greater yellowstone ecosystem where you sort of have this cultural custody battle around who owns this Indiana size Hunka land surrounding yellowstone where because of naming, people sort of think of it as as yellowstone when it certainly is not, it's a large area surrounding it, but there we had a period where we weren't, you know, we stopped grizzly hunting because the animals are being over harvested habitat destruction and then you go through an enormous amount of work to recover the species and people are extremely resistant to the idea that you would start hunting now that you would now start hunting something.

Speaker 1:          01:23:56       You weren't hunting a few days ago. Right. That's like. But it's also what you were saying earlier that it's not recognized as a game species because it's thought of something you eat. Yeah. Like mountain lions. Like even if mountain lions are a nuisance, like there was a woman that had um, she had a depredation permit because mountain lions had killed 10 alpacas and a goat in her farm in Malibu and she decided not to act on the permit because there were so many different people that were threatening her with so many wildlife activists that were threatening her and just general people online death threats because she, you know, she was gonna hire someone to shoot this mountain lion that had been. I mean it just went on a thrill kill and got into one of our pens, just went ham, you know, and, but people, they think of that thing is somehow or another better than her alpacas, which is very weird.

Speaker 1:          01:24:48       No people just recently protested the killing of tiger, a tiger in India that had killed 13 people. I saw that. I put that online and people in the comments where we were like, fuck those people. Okay, you're out of your mind. What if that was your sister when it was your daughter? When was your mom? What if is your brother, your brother? Watch, watch your brother. Getting dragged away by a giant monster. Yeah. You know, just because it's called a tiger. You're cool with that. Like, fuck, fuck your brother. Is that what you're saying that this was an interesting year. I don't mean that. Well, let me finish my thought and I don't want to sound callous when I called. Interesting, but Washington state had its first mountain lion mortality, like where a mountain lion killed a human for the first time and I think it was 94 years. Oregon is when Oregon had its first in state history and I'm with the one in Washington killed a person. They tracked the lying down and killed the lion and the state fish and game department got predictably like a bunch of blowback for having killed and I was talking to someone who was involved with that and I was standing up. I think that the blowback would have been a lot worse had you not done it. Yeah. You know, but you just don't. You don't hear from those people, but there is this. Would it be blow

Speaker 2:          01:26:04       back? Honestly, if they didn't kill the lion, the lion is just out there roaming around. I think people would just ignore it because the new cycle. So fucking quick. Yeah, I think they would lose. It would get lost and trump would say something stupid about North Korea or whatever and people would forget.

Speaker 4:          01:26:18       Yeah. Uh, I can, you know, I continue to, uh, you know, I continued to hunt black bears, black bears. It's like, you know, in the case of mountain lions, you have a rapidly expanding mountain lion populations. There's a lot of mountain lions, mountain lions, or [inaudible] new territory's all the time. They're managed, you know, most states manage them very tightly with mortality quotas, female mortality quarters open season, close these and permit draws, right? That they're managed as a game animal. Um, they're, they're, they're hunted and there's some allowable use of the renewable resource. And at the same time that that's going on, we're enjoying expanding populations of mountain lions. I love, I personally welcome the return of mountain lions to any suitable habitat where there's enough space for them to live without causing undue friction by them butting up against human interests and I encourage people who are in areas that are being caught recolonized by mountain lions to practice some level of tolerance and use best, best use practices or best case practices around to like avoid conflict. Right? Same thing with bears. I welcome the return of barriers. I think there's a lot of areas in this country a lot, but there's a handful of areas in this country that could have sustainable populations of grizzly bears that psych suitable habitat that is not being used by grizzly bears and couldn't, should be used by grizzly bears. At the same time, I like to see when it's appropriate. I like to see state managed wildlife practices and then allowable harvest of animals.

Speaker 2:          01:28:00       There's a lot of people listening to this, the don't even understand that mountain lions are edible and in fact you say delicious.

Speaker 4:          01:28:08       I liked them. I was eating mountain lions long before I ever hunted mountain. One hundred one mount line in my life and I've eaten a bunch more net. So I had never had the question about it. You know, I'd never had the question about whether it was good or not.

Speaker 2:          01:28:22       Majority of the people listening to this right now, I'll probably like what?

Speaker 4:          01:28:25       Yeah, among among Pounds Min, like monkey who deal lines is widely known that it's a very good meat, but I was introduced to it that way. There's a place when I was living in Missoula, Montana as a place 20 miles east. They're called Rock Creek Lodge and they're famous for having this big thing called the testicle festival in the fall where after you castrate steers, you know, people will fry up the nuts. Right. And so the testicle festivals as big as kind of like turning like this big head turned into this kind of bike biker festival, but it was this, this big party and it was centered around eating deep fried cow balls and we used to go down there all the time and go drinking. And

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       one time I was at that same place in the spring and this guy had a pot of a potluck, will look like pulled pork, you know, Bart with barbecue sauce and he had a bunch of bonds out and he's just giving it away. And I was eating it and he was telling me how it was mountain lion meat and you were saying you'll is he saying like balls in the fall and posting in the spring, you know, read mountain land there. And that was the first time I had mountain lion. And then later I had a girlfriend who's from Wyoming and she one day is standing behind a guy in a. she's standing behind a guy in a hardware store who's buying a mountain land tag. And she asked him, what do you do with all that meat? And he didn't want it. So she gave me her phone number.

Speaker 1:          01:29:42       And then when he got his line he gave us the whole damn thing. And so we ate that whole mountain lion than it had when I came into other mountain lion meat in other ways. And always enjoyed it to the point where I wasn't eating it because I had a moral obligation to eat what I killed. I was going out of my way to get it because I'd rather eat someone else's mountain lion than buy pork. Is Pork, is that similar to white meat man? Wow. You can take the back straps with fat on it. You can leave the fat on it and take that back strap and see. You've got a cookbook. So they'll have, you know, it's probably going to have trick analysis. So you got to cook the one six u, just like, oh, just how pork used to be a cook. It secret the fats good. The meat's good. We Cook it down, make all kinds of preparations with the cook down. My kids meet, they keep a bunch of wild. They eat a bunch of mountain lion meat, you know, well cooked it. But that's one of those things that we're not accustomed to, but we're. We're fine with things we are accustomed to. If you showed a mountain lion dead on social media and you're like, can't wait to eat this,

Speaker 2:          01:30:50       people would go fucking crazy. Yeah. When you saw that recent controversy with that woman who shot a goat invasive species on an island off of Scotland to an animal, they have to hunt. They literally have to hunt them if they don't. If you've never seen what a goat can do to an environment, they just destroy everything. They eat everything they can. They, they, they caused erosion. They, they, they decimate

Speaker 1:          01:31:11       all the local foliage. But they weren't seeing that and I think that they were like the people that were upset about that. We're really struggling to describe why it upset them. Even a politician to pointed out that the person was wearing camouflage because traditionally in Scotland you helped with different clothes and there was no secret that there's hunting going on out there. Right? No secret at all. It was that it's an American that she's wearing camouflage. She's adorned, you know, like, like makeup. And it was Kinda like a, like this beautiful image set up. She had a high powered rifle, which they're already using out there anyways, and it was just a confusing idea in a confusing image for people. Had to been some old Scottish dude with his, with his, you know, deerstalker outfit,

Speaker 4:          01:31:59       but there's something where people are like, uh, why her and why here? Yeah. And it also

Speaker 5:          01:32:05       her description of it as a fun hunt. I mean, people had a lot of problems with it, but it's also, I think because it's, there wasn't anything else going on. She caught a cycle, you know, she, she just got, you know, she was headed down the river and a tributary opened up and she went right into controversy bank. Yeah, that's what I think happened in the people that were tweeting about. I saw Glenn Glenn Greenwald tweet about it. I'm like, you're a journalist, like you're an actual journalist to respected journalist. You should really do some research on this because the way you're calling it, I don't know. I mean, Glenn Greenwald is a, I believe he's some sort of an animal rights activist. I don't know if he's a Vegan. I don't know if he's a vegetarian, but I know Ricky Gervais' isn't. He's not a vegetarian. He's no.

Speaker 4:          01:32:52       Oh really? Yes. That's the weird part, right? Yeah. That's funny man. That I didn't know that. I didn't know

Speaker 5:          01:33:00       the on a radio show about it. He needs me. Yes. We were talking about hunting and you know, I brought it up because we were on the radio show together on the opiod anthony show and I said, I shot bears and I eat them. I eat everything I kill and I hunt for food and I prefer to get meat that way. And we discussed the fact that he eats meat.

Speaker 4:          01:33:22       Huh?

Speaker 5:          01:33:24       It's a weird one, right? Because it's A. There's a virtue signaling aspect of shitting on hunters where you're always going to get some positive remarks about it.

Speaker 4:          01:33:35       It's, it's difficult for me. It's not difficult for me for from someone who doesn't. Who doesn't eat meat, right. I, I can, I don't have any. I don't have a problem with it. Like I'm like, you know, I, my brother said a bass like, I don't know. He said maybe they have a point when it's coming, someone who doesn't mean it winds up demonstrate that they're trying to put them to condemn hunters who are hunting like a regulated resource. Yeah. Chicken Dem, them. You're sort of acting like when you condemn you sort of acting like, oh, I care about these issues and I want to be out here and I want to be like articulating a perspective and, and I know what's going on, but then you're like putting yourself out as a person who has opinions of value, right? Just, just to like let your opinion be known.

Speaker 4:          01:34:23       So if you're going to have that, like where's the self examination exactly where you are. If you're eating meat, like you're contributing all kinds of animal death. Like what is your understanding of what is your understanding of those lives and those deaths? How is that not part of your reckoning? If I do, let's say I am happy that I got a bear that I will eat with my family. Let's say I am happy about it. Um, is it better for you that you're kind of, is it better to be sad about it somehow? Is it better to be regretful or just ignore the fact altogether or why is it not okay that I'm happy about what I eat? I know the story of it really well. Like I understand the history of wildlife in this country. I don't want to say better than anybody but damn sure better than most.

Speaker 4:          01:35:14       I know where we've been. I have a good sense of where we're going in terms of American wildlife, what the challenges are for American Wildlife, right? I'm involved in this stuff on a daily basis. I can know all that and I can see my place in it, right? I can see what my actions are and whether my actions are helpful or hurtful for something that I care a great deal about and if I can know that well and get a deer, a bear or whatever and have it be food and find that I'm like really happy to be involved in that. That somehow is off putting to people, but it's okay to be that. It's I'm blind to it, I have this nagging sense of guilt about it that I haven't reckoned with. I don't really know about it, you know, and that's like, that's like an accessible position for some people to have.

Speaker 4:          01:36:04       It's really hard for me with people that are, that are contributing to animal death, who, who want to condemn those who are more willing to or for whatever reason, willing to excited about taking part in the process themselves. I got to find a way to. I gotta find a way to, to, to engage with it though and I need to get a better understanding of it because the, the, the debate isn't going away. I can't keep brushing it off is so ridiculous that it doesn't warrant my time because clearly it does warrant my time to understand that perspective. I just haven't had anybody really give to me in a good way to I have to say like, oh, but they were raised to be eaten.

Speaker 5:          01:36:40       That's a foolish perspective to me is way, way worse. So life condemned. I'd rather talk to Google of Glenn Greenwald is a Vegan. I'd probably rather talk to someone like Ricky Gervais' about it because I. I assume that he's articulate about it and he's articulate. I don't think his position is a nuanced. I don't. I don't. I think there's some willful ignorance that's a part of people that eat meat, but condemn hunting a willful and the fact that, like I said, they know that they're going to get a certain reaction out of people when they tweet about it on social media. One thing, if you're talking about someone who out there shooting things and not eating it, okay, I get it. I'm with you. We'll see if some guy's just shooting an elephant because he wants his tusks. I'm on your side. I get it, but if someone chooses to hunt, you know, and an animal fill in the blank. That might be a goat, might be weird to you that they're eating this thing, but they're shooting this. It's an invasive species. It's actually very delicious. It's very edible. Prized for its meat by some communities. You don't make any sense you're doing this because you know that other people are ignorant about it as well, and either you're ignorant because you've never bothered to look into it or you've bothered to look into it and you're ignoring the nuance.

Speaker 4:          01:37:52       Yeah. In the case of the goat thing, there's a little added thing. There's an added

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       element that our government on the federal level is involved. There's a lot of state wildlife management agencies that are involved in trying to do a wild goat eradication projects on islands. Yes. This is something that's ongoing all the time in Hawaii. In many other places where were were. We're like out helicopter gunning helicopter gunning for invasive species. Explain to people how those goats got there and the first race, because this is also very weird, um, a variety of ways, but a lot of things were a lot of island species. This is one way it happens where invasive on islands would be introduced by seafarers, whalers who would want to establish food resources along transoceanic routes so that you could put something there and come back and get it later, early way like way. He used to come out of the the, the American Ne, like all those famous whaling villages in New England, you know, they would go down and stop in and stop in and the Galapagos, whatever, gather up tortoises that they could flip over in the whole of a boat and the tourists to stay alive for months on its back.

Speaker 1:          01:39:12       You'd have like a fresh meat resource and as people came to understand scurvy and realizing that fresh meat gives you enough vitamin C to avoid scurvy that you can get from dried meat because the way the vitamin C behaves through the cooking and drawing process, but like fresh meat, you can keep them. Having scurvy me became even more important than. But people would come in and cut some sheep, loose cuts, some bolts loose on an island and know that they're going to breed and build up a big population and that can be like a place. You stop in and get food and other things get introduced in other ways. And of course animals move, you know, so you have one island has close proximity to another island they can swim across. Yeah. Bump over and it destroys native vegetation. They trampled bird's nests and so you have many cases where introductions of non natives, particularly non native grazing animals, non native predators will wind up causing like a lot of extinctions of endemic species on islands and creates all kinds of problems

Speaker 5:          01:40:15       and that's exactly what we're talking about with this. Go in that picture. So this is an animal that must be killed if you want healthy wildlife on that island, the native wildlife and the native fauna, the flora, all this stuff that lives there. All this stuff that's supposed to be there. You got to kill the goats. Otherwise they'll eat everything.

Speaker 1:          01:40:33       But I think people look, people look and they, they, they, they, they, they look and they're like, I don't buy that. That was the motivation of that person. What I care about his motivations of individuals. I think you're right because when California got rid of mountain lion hunting, they're still killing several hundred mountain lions here a year. People are comfortable, like the total

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       lion kill didn't change much. People are comfortable with estate agent or someone being paid to go out and kill lines. They're not comfortable with some pain. Who wants to go

Speaker 2:          01:41:07       do it? I don't think they realize. I don't think they realize that state agencies are killing as many mountain lions in California as they are. I don't think people understand that. I think people do understand. If something gets put on the ballot, would you like to reintroduce mountain lion hunting? People would go crazy. Like why would you do that? Mountain lions are beautiful. They're exciting. I want to see them, but these are people in Santa Monica, you know what I'm saying? They're not people that are living, you know, an hour outside of Bakersfield and they got 16 mountain lions in their backyard and a year. That's a different kind of world. You know, if they're in the tach p mountains out there and you see mountain lions all the time. They have a lot of mountain lions.

Speaker 4:          01:41:46       Yeah. And the real issue, and there was a problem too that I view this is coming from there's a problem or I think a lot of people have a very hard time empathizing with people who might be negatively impacted by wildlife as well in the question of the lion issue where it's kind of like this idea like, well you better suck it up, right? Yeah. So if you're a rancher and you're running cattle and the area where you're losing a lot of cattle, the walls and grizzlies people will look and be like, you better suck it up, buddy. Like I can't really picture your problem, but your complaints are not legitimate. Well they can't. If someone were to cut a. If someone were to cut a grizzly Lewis and golden gate state part, right. I don't know. Um, I think that people would have, would come to have a different perspective on that to put it mildly.

Speaker 4:          01:42:42       Yeah. But it winds up being the. You look and people are, they don't really want to hear about other people's problems if it doesn't, if it doesn't jive with their understanding of what problems are. And that's the area where the issue around grizzly bears and the delisting, so you know, they were delisted, they were removed from the endangered species act protection temporarily because they had, had met all recovery goals. So when we look mostly recovered population look like they mapped out what it would look like and we've exceeded that for many years now. And they were delisted, but then a Wyoming and Idaho moved to have a very limited hunt on them. Um, and then they were a federal judge blocked the listing and they went back and listing it was the federal judges motivation. Well, you want to hope that, uh, that they didn't have one you want, you want to think that they were just looking at, you know, the details of it. But I think there's a suspicion that that person went into that knowing damn sure what they were gonna do, you know? Uh, but you don't really know a lot of these arguments around. They'd come down to like technicalities, right? No one's arguing that the populations recovering

Speaker 2:          01:43:57       well. There's also the argument that the judge is probably trying to protect his own reputation because the amount of blow back that a judge would receive for allowing a hunt to go through is vastly different than blocking a hunt. You know, blocking. You Hunt, you're not gonna get that much blow back. You'll get a few people that are upset, but it hadn't been an established resource. Not only you're taking something away from people, but if he allowed it pour the wildlife. People would go fucking bananas on this guy.

Speaker 4:          01:44:22       Yeah. They, they tend to like, and I don't even call them and like I don't call them environmentalists, people who sued to block the delisting of recovering species, the masquerade as ecologically conscious environmentalist, but they're just people who it's, it's untenable to them. They can't, they're never going to accept the idea that you're going to have human exploitation of this resource. Right. Did they masquerade that they're. They have an environmental motivation was not. It's like it's an animal rights motivation. There's a very, there's a, they have a sensitive ear in a certain federal court, you know, in Missoula, and so you'll see a lot of these cases around wolves and grizzlies. They'll get that. They want it done through that court. They know their going to have a friendly take on it. I think it was a real. It was watching that happen and that's been happening recently.

Speaker 4:          01:45:14       I think it was a real, a real travesty because there's a couple of things that happen like culturally an areas where you'll. You create a lot of tension with people where there's people that are living amongst these things and they're looking for some level of some level of relief and they want to see it go to state management and they might want to see the state exercise. Some control over where certain populations of large predators are spreading into and when it winds up being that they're like, their voices are not heard, you know, and they feel that people from far away are really heavily influencing decisions that affect them on a daily basis. It winds up creating a lot of animosity toward the species to where they think about what happened with the spotted owl, right? The spotted owl. No one can see. No one perceives the spotted owl, an owl anymore. The spotted owl is become like a symbol of federal overreach and you'll find that you know wolves for awhile they become like a symbol of a dispute and people stopped liking the animals much and it becomes like this contentious creature and I think that we're going to head that way if we keep, if we keep stepping in on wildlife issues with the mentality that we've been approaching the wool from grizzly issue in the northern Great Lakes, the northern rockies, soon to be in the greater yellowstone ecosystem. Now I think you're dealing with low

Speaker 2:          01:46:38       cool, and then you're dealing with national, right? So the local people are going to have an issue with it because they're going to be impacted by it. It's going to be directly impacting their life. Dogs are going to be killed while they're gonna

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       take domestic cattle and all sorts of different things. You've got to have real issues with the people that liked to go elk hunting. The populations have diminished rapidly, but the rest of the country doesn't give a shit. People in San Francisco, they don't give a fuck about it. People in Chicago aren't impacted by it, especially if they don't have anyone in their family that haunts or anyone that has a background in hunting and they don't have a background in it themselves. They don't care.

Speaker 1:          01:47:16       No. People really don't. And it's, I, I pointed out all the time, but, um,

Speaker 1:          01:47:22       that I care about the availability and been an abundance of deer, elk, Moose, Caribou, right? Like, I care about the resource. There's a lot of people who rely on the resource, use the resource there, major economic drivers. Um, I'm definitely, I'm anything but I'm like, I, I regard myself as a pro wolf person. I regard myself as a pro grizzly person. I cherish every interaction I have with those animals. Do you think to be around a number of resource. I don't have a problem with common resource to people, but people do have a problem with calling resource and um, and, and yeah, I'm like pro. I'd like to, in suitable habitat, I like to see them present. I also like to see that, that I also like to see them managing the way that allows for a bond and wild game resources. What's going on? House passed the bill to drop legal protections for gray wolves as past today, or will this interesting was two hours ago, so well roll down a little bit.

Speaker 5:          01:48:25       Republican controlled House passed a bill on Friday to drop legal protections or gray wolves across the lower 48 states reopening a lengthy battle over the Predator species, long despised by farmers and ranchers. Wolves were shot, trap, poisoned out of existence, and most of the u s in the Mid Twentieth Century by the Mid Twentieth Century. Since securing protection in the 19 seventies, wolves have bounced back. Well, it's not really excited what happened. Great Lakes of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin as well in the northern rockies and Pacific northwest. That's SORTA, but they're not talking about the reintroduction. Reintroduction is the big issue. Right. Well, and that's what people have great issue with.

Speaker 1:          01:48:59       Well, the other, the reintroduction is only in one area. The Great Lake, the northern Great Lakes. That was not a reintroduction. There was a sizable population. I will movements of wolves coming down from Canada and coming back in the northern Ca, the court, northern continental divide ecosystem. Not a reintroduction famous. Yeah. Well, yeah. The famous case of the famous reintroduction, Yellowstone National Park, so viewed now. It's widely viewed now that if you wouldn't have done that, you would have had had you not done that reintroduction, you'd have had a natural flow anyway. A natural flow from Canada. You would have got it. You would have, you would have eventually you would eventually have gotten there anyway. Interesting. But would they have gotten to the exact same levels? No, no. At this particular point right now as I think that'd be like laughable to act as though they'd be there now, I think, but, but people.

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       There's no realization that you would have that without the reintroduction you would've, through natural movement, have eventually gotten, you know, do you.

Speaker 5:          01:49:57       I think that that's, uh, that the, that supports the idea of the reintroduction. You think the introduction was well thought out.

Speaker 4:          01:50:05       I don't want it, you know, I'm not going to debate the merits of the reintroduction. Like I said, my perspective on it. It should be in a place where it supports them. Yeah. My perspective on it is I, I don't, uh, the idea of extinction and regional extirpation sickens me, I do not believe in. I do not believe that like as a people, as a culture, we can justify or afford to remove species of wildlife from the landscape. Um, native species of wild there from the landscape. Like I said, the idea of sickens me, I like to, you know, I like to have all native wildlife present on the landscape so

Speaker 4:          01:50:53       I don't oppose it. What I oppose is a thing that's happened now is getting where we have populations that we agree like what will recovery look like and at what point when, how will we manage all the different viewpoints that are coming in, all the different interests of all these varied stakeholders. Net what point where we get in there and manipulate the situation that we're creating. I just would move that in a different direction where I think that when that recovered species, right in this case, when we're talking about walls and grizzlies, I think that you should have that. If you can do it in a sustainable way that doesn't have longterm deleterious impacts on the population that they should be managed as a renewable resource.

Speaker 5:          01:51:37       See, this is where people are going to have issues. I don't have any. Just even the term manage them as a renewable resource. You mean shoot them and kill them and use their. For

Speaker 4:          01:51:49       sure. I think that, I think that recovered bcs that I think that if you put something on the endangered species act and it goes under federal protection, um, and then when it reaches recovery and the US fish and wildlife service as it's recovered, it's time to hand it back to state management. If a state then decides that they're going to do some limited harvest, particularly let's say they're, even if they're focusing on areas where there's like very high prevalence of human animal conflict and the state decides to do that in some like minor way as a way to service the needs of certain segments of their population that wants something to happen. I don't think that then some like an activist judge or or environmental groups or animal rights groups should come and be like, well nevermind. We're going to pretend that they're not recovered now because we want to prevent the state from doing something that we think is unsavory.

Speaker 5:          01:52:40       Well, the thought process behind the people that support blocking the hunt is that if you leave these

Speaker 2:          01:52:46       animals alone, naturally they're going to find balance and that the wolves will kill the elk. Until there's not enough elk for them to sustain their populations and the numbers of their offspring will dwindle and they'll get to some sort of a sustainable level.

Speaker 4:          01:53:00       Yeah, but we already. I mean, we live in a. We live in a heavily manipulated kind of land kind of manmade environment. Now the idea that things are gonna, we would just let things run their course and watch what happens isn't going to happen. You're still going to have a lot of grizzlies. Every year are still going to get in trouble. They're still going to get killed. You're still going to have mortality. You know you're going to have tons of grizzy mortality in tough areas, but they're going to kill. These are enacting and packs. That's how they kill. They kill cattle and they come up. They brought up against humans. It's just like, it's inevitable. You're gonna. Have some that you're not going to let it run as a. As a person, as a hunter. I also don't have a problem with and actually support as a hunter that we would all while allowing wolves to be present on the landscape, that we would mitigate their impact on big game. I don't mind saying, I don't mind just coming out and saying that I like to have high populations of big game animals that are available to hunters and also at the same time sharing some of that resource there. Having wolves on the ground doing it. I don't want to see them gone. Not Anti Wolf, not anti grizzly.

Speaker 2:          01:54:12       It's just one of those war. It's because of wolf is so much like a dog and because there's not a great history of people eating. I remember you telling me about one mountain men were. His favorite food was wolf. Stefansson is the Arctic explorer. What a crazy fucker. That guy must've loved wolf meet. You ever tried it? No. No, no. Levy in coyote.

Speaker 4:          01:54:35       You Eaten Caio. So you've eaten that species and I've never. I've never killed a wolf. Never killed a grizzly bear. Just haven't. Haven't eaten either of them. I won coyote. Yeah. Didn't aid it. Didn't like it. Haven't messed with one sense. Yeah. You said that was similar to divert duct to. Right. That was Ramey. Ramey felt that it tastes like bad. Diver duck diver ducks and still eat diver ducks. But no, I haven't. No, I haven't, uh, haven't done that anymore. And then, um, haven't included any coyote recipes in. There was no coyote recipes in the wild game cookbook either wolf might be the ultimate one that people are going to have a problem with at the very. That might be where the rubber hits the road. Well, you know, in some places become a moot point because Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, I'm all have state management of Walt's. Yeah. All of the things that we're. All these horrible things that were going to happen when the state's resume management of wolves didn't materialize. Right. But those places also have a rich history of hunting. Yeah. But it was, it was going to be the end of wolves. Right. It hasn't in the first few

Speaker 1:          01:55:44       years, in the first few years of the wool seasons, he actually had. He actually saw the populations go up so hard to hunt them. Right? Well, it winds up being the, uh, putting that with that little bit of hunting pressure on them really changed there, really changed their movements and change the way they perceive human threats and they adjust to it pretty quickly, but it hasn't led to, you know, I think a lot of people look in those cases where it was pretty effective. It was very effective to bring in, to bring in limited regulated hunting, had the desire to fact on how we're using the landscape and in ways in which they were interacting and info and avoiding humans. And I have no doubt too, I have no doubt too, like it'll the situation will probably in the northern Great Lakes, they had state management, law, state management, like it bounces back and forth.

Speaker 1:          01:56:35       You're going to, you're going to eventually, let me kind of depends on how the political winds blow, but you're eventually gonna wind up with it there and you're not going to see wolves vanished from the landscape. You know, you're just not. If grizzly bears wind up doing it, you're still gonna. See, you're gonna see gradually expanding populations of grizzly bears to fight despite the fact that they're using limited harvest to achieve certain management objectives is not going to be the end of the world that just not. Yeah, I agree with you and I think the grizzly bear thing, you'd probably have the same sort of situation where the grizzlies will eventually think of people as a threat and it'd probably be safer for everybody. That's one thing that people. That's one thing that people hope, and again, people aren't really a lot of people looking from the outside in.

Speaker 1:          01:57:15       I'm very sensitive to it. Yeah. To the idea of the way that which that's you know, that this has impacted professional hunting guides, hunters, but these are my people. These are people that I care about and I care about their needs. Right. And it's an issue. So time will tell where that, where that winds up. Well, we see an MBC where they've just taken it away and they take it. They've taken it away in a very irrational way because they have a large population of grizzlies and pc. It's very large and for people that live up there that, that hunt them, this is kind of scaring the shit out of them that all of a sudden you've taken this away. First of all, it was a source of income for a lot of these people that would guide them, but it was also a smart thing to control the population and keep them away from humans.

Speaker 1:          01:58:01       Well that I watched that closely though. I don't feel it being another country, you know, you don't have that sense of um, being that other countries don't have that sense of the, of that you could influence, you know, so it's Kinda like watching something happen in a distant way and you don't feel it as closely and I don't know all the factors that play as well as I do here. Well, I have some friends that live up there. My friend Mike [inaudible], who's a guide up there and he told me horror stories about grizzlies had shoot one trying to get into his cabin from six feet away and you know, their, their big fuckers, they are, I love them to death. They're great. I mean, it's cool that they're real. I mean, it really is. It's a wild thing that there we have this huge monster that lives in the woods.

Speaker 1:          01:58:52       I haven't been charged by him. I wouldn't change a thing, man. You were charged by. I'm, I like having. I like every encounter in every mixup and it's really, it's like deeply complicated stuff in when talking about these things, it's also they become like everything they become a proxy were, were, were we're engaged in a debate about what is, you know, we're engaged in debate about like conflicting views on wildlife and these animals step in to this debate and the debate centers around them and it winds up being bigger than a debate about grizzlies. Bigger than it is a debate about bison or buffalo, right? Bigger than a debate about wolves. It's just that these animals step into this ongoing dialogue about what is our relationship with the natural world? What does that relationship with renewable resources, what does that relationship with rural versus urban perspectives on how people should be around wildlife can be impacted by wildlife and so it's this through line of us trying to sort out how to be like good, responsible stewards of the landscape and that debate always centers around these things.

Speaker 1:          02:00:05       Like you could have a huge argument you'd be like in a lot of tension with your spouse. Right? And it springs up in a debate about how best to load the dishwasher or who was supposed to pick up the kid from school and there's always like, it always finds a place to live. Um, and right now we're like this argument about American wildlife and what is our relationship to it has found its place live right now around large predators. And in Scotland it's found its way to live around a feral goat on an island. Well, that one case, all the traveling that you do and all the hunting trips you go on this, has it gotten to a point ever that it seems like a job?

Speaker 1:          02:00:53       Yeah. As now that I have kids, I, it's changed a little bit, I view it a little bit differently, um, but no, I still, I still really love it and I'm able to know that I'm able to know that I'm missing my family while I'm out. I'm, I'm able to know that and feel that pain and still know that I love what I do and I love talking about the things that I talk about and, and you know, and I view it like as a, as I'm sure you do, like it's like this tremendous privilege that you're able to,

Speaker 3:          02:01:26       uh,

Speaker 1:          02:01:29       Kinda grow up to have to have this like intense interest in the subject and this intense stress and lifestyle and then have the ability to like introduce people to all these different ideas. Uh, so yeah, I can have those two things simultaneous. I'm the kind of long to be home more but enjoying being out. I think if it would, if the longing to be home more would override that someday it might change it. But right now I'm, you know, I've just have seen so many things that I'm happy to have seen and to think about a future of not accumulating those experiences at the rapid rate that I've accumulated. And um, it kind of bums me out a little bit.

Speaker 5:          02:02:10       Yeah. You've lived 100 lives, you know that the trip that you were talking about when you were in South America and the jungle and you came across those pictographs. What do you say? How do you call those things? Petroglyphs. Petroglyphs, petroglyphs on the rocks that no one had any idea who made no one know why they were just there. Now it's not like a spot on a map that tourists go to visit. Oh, here's the petroglyphs. No, they're just there. They're just there. And the hunters like, yeah, there they are. The ancient ones made these, hey, let's get the fish. You know, they, they really don't give a shit, but it's like, you're, you're, you're seeing who knows how old that is. Thousand years old years old.

Speaker 1:          02:02:49       Yeah. To run into stuff like that. Yeah. Beautiful experiences, man. And then the, you know, to eat the way I eat and live the way I, it's, it's, yeah, I feel fortunate in all the time.

Speaker 5:          02:03:06       Well, I think you're very important because there's a, there's a real lack of well-read, articulate people that support your position that are in the media. I mean, you got a lot of these shows that are on these, the hunting networks that they appeal to a very narrow bandwidth in this narrow bandwidth is, you know, just uh, it's, it, it's like your stereotypical idea of what hunting is to a lot of people. So they'll flip through the channels that watched that for a few minutes. You see someone hooting and hollering after they shoot something and they get this bad taste in their mouth about it. Whereas I tell people all the time, if you really want to get an understanding about what hunting is about, I always recommend your show because your, your narration and your reverence for what you're doing and the animals and just, uh, your, your appreciation for how cool the experience is and how wild it is, you know, for lack of a better term to just, to be out there in nature and to be in the pursuit of these things. And then the, take these things, these wild creatures and feed your family and have it become a part of your life and to sustain yourself with it. Primarily, it's a, it's you, you're giving a perspective that I don't think is available that I think is, uh, is important because it's just, there's so many people out that are out there that are hunters, that are smart, well read people that feel frustrated like, God. I wish everybody could see it the way I see it.

Speaker 4:          02:04:50       Yeah. I think it's poor. And to point out that my love of hunting and fishing and of living like a hands on relationship with the natural world, living in close proximity to wildlife, like my interest in that and desire to do that,

Speaker 3:          02:05:09       uh,

Speaker 4:          02:05:10       predated by a long ways. My ability to talk about why I think that those things are important. It was there. It wasn't like I didn't grow up around that. And then later started understanding this stuff and thinking about it and then decided like, well, the path for me then considering what I know now, the path we then would do to figure out hunting. It was like hunting was there. I loved it, I love it today. And I just had the luxury through what I do for a living to spend a lot of time thinking about, well, why is that the case if this feels like harmonious to you and you can kind of live in this and understand and see how you fit into some greater, you know, ecological picture, right? Um, if it does feel that way and that seems to be true, how is it that like why is that right?

Speaker 4:          02:06:00       And it was pushing at those edges that I eventually developed a way in which I talk about it now. I meet all kinds of people who live that same lifestyle that I lived growing up and when I talked to him, a thing that they appreciate is just that, that someone is articulating to them something that they felt to be true and knew to be true but just hadn't had the time or you know, didn't have the time or ability to really go out and express it. So I just, I would never want to act like, like I've been, like, I certainly have not invented some way of thinking about it, like elbow leopold in Theodore Roosevelt, Gifford Pincho, uh, throughout history like Jim Harrison and Tom mcguane for contemporary writers. There's been, a lot of people have been saying and talking about an experience in the outdoors in a way like, I haven't invented some new thing. I'm just like, I'm trying to. I'm working toward like articulate and expressing something that has been in existence for a long time. If people see negative stereotypes when you're on youtube or see negative stereotypes on certain television shows, a lot of that stuff is self feeding, you know, I think a lot of that stuff gets created because it does have a shock value to it and I would think that that minus the camera,

Speaker 4:          02:07:15       a lot of minus the camera, a lot of activities that people might feel are abhorrent might not even be taking place where there is a hamming it up for the camera that goes on.

Speaker 5:          02:07:27       Interesting. Do you think that there's like a sort of a stereotypical pattern they feel like they have to fall into so they fall into it when the camera's on, like a Dj Strip club voice?

Speaker 4:          02:07:37       Yeah. I think the only thing that, there's some of them, you know what I mean? I think there's some of that. I think there's [inaudible] and there's also lay people a thing that happens with people who feel under attack. Um, and, and in many ways, you know, hunters are under attack and a lot of ways and a lot of places. And I think that there's a way when you're, you feel like you're being attacked, you feel like you're being pigeonholed, stereotyped or response is to cram it right back down someone else's throat. Right, right. You're like, oh, I'll show you. And there's definitely that stuff. Or like you fall into this, us against them, you know, fuck down. Like I'm gonna, you know, I'll show them how we really are. Right. And you, you get into this kind of dialogue thing, it's a lot more pain. It's more painful. I think I'm maybe not more painful is definitely more hard to be like, okay, let's, let's talk about this for real. This is really something we need to discuss. Let's dig in and discuss it. And I think that a lot of people feel like I'm. That hunting feels like something that's natural with them. They like to do it and they don't feel the need to take the time to explain it. And when questioning when pressed to explain it, they maybe kind of lash out,

Speaker 5:          02:08:49       you know? Yeah. It may be lack the ability to look at it from an outside perspective because it's been a part of their life their whole life and they don't want to justify it. Um, yeah. It's salt. There's also the weird thing that as much as you can appreciate hunting and think of it as an ethical way to acquire, meet everybody, can't do it. We've got too many people. It's untenable and that, that's, that's uh, I mean there's no responsibility for you to acknowledge that, but it's, it's something that gets brought up when people talk about the, the how ethical acquisition of meat is really like either hunting or you'd have to raise something yourself and be absolutely aware or get something from a farmer who's, you know, completely ethical from, from birth to death and you have to be comfortable with that. But the most ethical, in my opinion is a hunting. But then people always say, yeah, but everybody can hunt. Okay. But I can. So if I can, what do I do about the fact that everybody can.

Speaker 4:          02:09:58       Well, everyone could come in. It's a moot point because it's just, it doesn't matter. I guess they're not going to, but no, certainly everyone could enter into the hunting game, you know, you could come in and hunt. It would just mean that you had a much larger pool of people after a limited resource and that limited resource would be allocated in a different way. Yeah, you could have total participation and it would just be that every person's slice of the pie will be much smaller, but it's not, you know, when we look at when a statement like looks at like, what's, uh, what, what's, what's a Turkey harvest that our state could support these, break the state up into a bunch of different units. They look at population trends and they determine like, how many Turk you can we afford to harvest without impacting the Turkey population?

Speaker 4:          02:10:50       Right? If everyone in the state wanted to chance use the lined up with the same number, you'd wind up with the same number of Turkey's being killed. It would just be that you would have less opportunity. You have to wait longer to get your turn. So it's not that everybody can't. Um, I, I don't think that, but it's not even really point because everybody will not, when I do the stuff that I do, like in, in writing a wild game cookbook, I'm doing two things and running wild game took, but I'm doing the main thing that I feel is the most important part of my job are the most important part of what I am is I'm like having a conversation with people who live this lifestyle, right? Like those are people that I relate to. I want to represent the world in a way that it enhances their lives, provide education, right.

Speaker 4:          02:11:36       And share my experiences with an audience of people that I recommend is a tribe that I'm part of, which would be like American hunters and anglers. And I'm presenting them like doing a cookbook. I'm presenting them like best practices, how to sort of like live the best version of a wild game lifestyle that they can. Here's the way to think about and approach wild game. But uh, but also the secondary part, what I'm doing is presenting a world to people who might be unfamiliar with it. And yes, do I have the hope that people will like say, read this book and then be like, man, I want to participate in this lifestyle that could mean as much as I'm walking down to the local river in their city and flipping over rocks and picking up crayfish, but it is introducing them, bringing them into the natural world and bringing them into engagement with nature and I do view and hope that that will happen. Will it happen in some grand scale where we'll have hundreds of millions of hundreds in this country? Now? That's not going to happen, but I do think that it is important that we do have more people involved. We in large measure, we fund much of our wildlife work and management from law enforcement disease research on and on. We fund that stuff through hunting and fishing licenses and through excise taxes on sporting goods equipment. If the more people that are engaged with this activity, I think the better it winds up being for American wildlife.

Speaker 5:          02:13:02       I agree, but the idea is that everyone can't do it. So the idea that you're saying that this is how you ethically acquire meat, this is not a, it's not a solution for everyone, but I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't say that this is the only way saying you. I'm saying this is one of the arguments that people make. If you say that, you know, hey, I hunt for my meat. This is how I ethically acquire me. Well, everybody can't do that because there's not enough animals. Good. That's true. That's true. Everybody can't do that if, if even more people got involved. I mean it's not, it's, it's not a solution for the entire population. You can say, well that's good. The entire population is not going to do it anyway, but it's a that gets into it. It's a stranger. There's just the giant number of human beings that need to be fed. Yeah. There's almost no other solution than the solution that we're doing right now. Unless they come up with some sort of a lab created meat or whatever the fuck they're gonna come up with next, which they are. Do your lips are curling as the involuntary? I said,

Speaker 4:          02:14:11       yeah, I'm pretty happy with, uh, I'm pretty happy with my diet right now. Yeah. And um, uh, but, uh, yeah, I watched that kind of stuff and I'm curious about it, but I don't, I don't take it as a personal insult by any stretch now if everybody switched the lab created meat, but I still had the in. I still had the ability to continue eating how I live, how I live, like I don't view that as being a future problem.

Speaker 5:          02:14:36       Rocky Mountain Elk Federation is reintroduced foundation. Yep. What I say, Federation Foundation, um, they've, they've introduced elk too, a lot of different places and made sustainable populations that are now hunted. And this is me, this is a beautiful thing and I'd hope that they continue to spread and continue to do that. Do you think it's possible that other game animals could be reintroduced to places where they would develop such a large population that we could sustain maybe even double the amount of hunters that we have now? Is that possible?

Speaker 4:          02:15:07       Well, put it this way, yes. Okay. For Stars, yes. You know that you just pull up an article about wolves united selling like every article from mainstream news sources to get that involves wolves. You'll, you'll kind of detect the bias of the individual writing it and they're saying how walls have only been recovered across 10 percent of their historic range elk.

Speaker 4:          02:15:31       That's about the same for elk. Yeah, right. Elk are missing from 80 plus percent of their historic range in the lower 48. Right. But we have, you know, at various times may have a quarter million of them live in Colorado or you know, some states got $100,000, whatever you get now, perhaps 20,000 living in Kentucky, those were all gone. New Mexico at a point had zero, right? Michigan, zero, Kentucky, zero, Pennsylvania, zero elk were gone from the unregulated slaughter of the market hunting era when people could shoot, meet and sell it into urban meat markets. Right? They eliminate American wild game before we figured out how to do what the word I keep using all the time now, which is regulated, harvest, regulate, uh, management. Um, so all that stuff was gone later. Their estates where there was no, uh, states where there was no deer hunting at the time of European contact.

Speaker 4:          02:16:28       We had turkeys 39 states. It got whittled down to target in 19 states. You don't have Turkey hunting seasons in 49 states. We've done a tremendous job of recovering wildlife, particularly a tremendous job of to demonstrate like what happens to an animal that hunters value and love and are able to use as a renewable resource is those species tend to really enjoy a lot of protections and they thrive because people are vested in their best interests. So yeah, we've created Turkey hunting seasons in 30 states. So yes, you can recover what you can do things, a wildlife and like create resources. The fact that we now we used to argue about what's gonna happen with dear, we're going to let dr deer to extinction in certain states or extra patients. Certain states now are big argument is what do we do with having so many deer here?

Speaker 4:          02:17:20       It winds up being that you come up against social tolerances. It's hard to like when we fill in the map on elk, when Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation looks and filling in the map on elk, you got to sell people on the idea that you're going to recover elk and there's a lot of resistance to recovering wildlife because a lot of so it's inconvenient to have around. They do a great job of brokering deals with states and finding places where you know a state maybe has a patch of habitat they think could support the animals and providing the expertise and financial support and all that stuff like bringing in those things, but generally you wind up where because of settlement and cities and suburban areas, we wound up with fewer and fewer places where we can go and do it. So to really fill in the map on, on recovering elk across all that range where they're supposed to be.

Speaker 4:          02:18:08       I don't know that we'll get there, but we've gotten there in a lot of other stuff and it was like the wild sheep foundation, right? They're trying to do the same thing with bighorn sheep. There is not even social attitudes. There winds up being disease like they spent from domestic sheep. Yeah. Their main, like the main problem preventing us from recovering bighorn sheep is disease types of pneumonia. The come from domestic sheep. Wow. And people you know, to go in and say to someone who's running sheep on a mountain domestic sheep on a mountain and say, Hey, no insult you and no insult to the, you know, your forebears who've been sheep ranchers here for 120 years or whatever. But we would like to try to recover American wildlife and bring big horns back to this mountain range and that's going to require you moving these sheep out of the way.

Speaker 4:          02:18:56       It's an insulting idea that people. So there's a blocker there and every animal has it's own type of problem. Turkeys. It worked because people don't, don't get pissed about tr, you know, like having them around and then look at what's going on with just allowing, you know, allowing bison the walkout of yellowstone national park. It's been an issue for a quarter century now. People are like, I'm not comfortable with you letting these big ass things walk out of the park and roam around because of disease grazing. Right. There's like people don't want to be inconvenienced by wildlife. These are places where I would be like in that area. I'd really like to see like when a. When a. When a bison leave the park, he stops being a wild animal and becomes livestock.

Speaker 2:          02:19:46       What's going on with that American Savannah thing? What does that, that, that program. The Apr? Yeah. What do they call them? That again? The American prairie reserve. Yeah. What is going on with that? Explained what the fuck that is because this is crazy.

Speaker 4:          02:20:02       I mean, I know it's a long story too long. Yeah. We're gonna have. We're. We're working with having the. It's too long. We're working with having the founder on our show.

Speaker 2:          02:20:12       Yeah. To have a conversation. Prayer Reserve. They're essentially trying to do is reintroduce a bunch of animals into a gigantic chunk of land and they continue to buy up more of this land and why aren't they running block management on this as well? Yes.

Speaker 4:          02:20:29       There's a lot. There's a lot, yeah, there's a lot of suspicions and controversy and it's like a, it's a, it's an idea that a lot of people are uneasy with, but the problem, not the problem. The thing is it's like people who are, you know, they, they have uh, they have funding and have a thing where there, when land comes for sale, they buy it and the goal of buying up the land is to turn it back into, you know, turn it back into wildlife habitat for native wildlife and at wine. It's contrary. It's the controversy around. It stems from the fact that some people don't like to see areas that were supported like traditional economies in rural areas like cattle ranching and, and to see these, see these areas returning to a wild landscape is threatening to people from the hunter perspective is they're allowing.

Speaker 4:          02:21:25       There's lot of places that people used to be able to hunt and the American prairie reserve is allowing hunting to go on and people are coming in and saying, well, they need to make sure that they need to assure us that hunting will be allowed here in perpetuity. And because we're suspicious about what's going on, so there's a lot of, like, you hear about it in so many ways, but the core mission is something that most people, um, when you look at it, the core mission, something that most people are going to look at it and be pretty comfortable with, be like, okay, you're a guy or an organization, you have money. And when a ranch comes up for sale, you buy it on the open market. Seller names is price. You pay, the price is now your land if you choose to not run cattle. But wanna have bison roam around on it. Why should I care? Right. Right. But people do care because they look at it as being like a value judgment. Uh, they look at it as being like a value judgment about rural economies and about agriculture. Oh Huh. I didn't think

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       about that. And there's a thousand more aspects of this were like, it's a rich subject. Dude. I'd love to get into it more about it.

Speaker 4:          02:22:36       Next time I come on. Okay. Next time you can take like an hour to explain the situation. What is their long term plan like? How long is this going on for? It's been going on for quite a while, right? Oh, the longterm play is that overtime you would assemble a p, a chunk of the great plains that is far bigger than yellowstone national park that supports a thriving population of Bison Wolves, grizzly bears, um, you know, in a, in a park like setting, but it doesn't come without a, you know, it doesn't come without its own bits of controversy

Speaker 6:          02:23:18       and

Speaker 4:          02:23:19       yeah, again, it's like it's the thing that everyone has opinions about there. There was a version they don't like to talk about that. There was a version of this called the Buffalo Commons that happened long ago where a, um, there was a social scientist named, I think it was frank popper by the last name of popper and he was looking at demographic patterns on the Great Plains and he was observing the ways in which the, the gray areas on the great plains, where the population was shrinking. Okay. So there's a lot of counties and on the Great Plains where through various like longterm agricultural trends and other issues where the human population is rapidly shrinking, rapidly declining. And this sociologist brought up this idea that if these trends continue, you're going to have this rare case in which a landscape sort of accidentally rewilding. Okay. [inaudible] where everyone left, which is not a story we're familiar with when we look at what happened.

Speaker 4:          02:24:21       So wildlands, you know, across the world, right? The general stories like people move in and wildlife moves out. So this idea that became the Buffalo Commons. Okay. And that was, it just so happens that, that idea that this, the idea kind of centered around this area on Jordan, Montana, right? Because you have large tracks of federally managed public land up there, you had a lot of ag like ranch land that wasn't that expensive and people could buy it. And that was like the seed of the idea. I think that now that was such an unpopular notion because it had to do with like economic decay, right? And shrinking towns and reduced resources for public education and all that kinds of stuff that comes from having an economy that is not thriving, but over time that like Buffalo Commons idea kind of segwayed into this American prairie reserve idea and it happened to be sort of centered around the same chunk of land. Bill Kittridge, a Western writer who deals with a lot of landscape and environmental issues, was talking about a in the wake of the Buffalo Commons idea and poppers work was talking about going to Jordan, Montana and talking about the Buffalo Commons is a great way to get your ass kicked because it's this idea like if, if culturally, like the agricultural producers and ranchers were celebrated and they made a civilization out of the wilderness and they brought an animals and created economies and creative communities. And for someone to now say, you know, thanks, but no thanks bro.

Speaker 4:          02:25:51       We'd rather go back and eliminate your presence on this landscape and we don't in fact value what you did. And we're going to try as hard as we can to undo what you did because we now view it as the you did the year people did the wrong thing. We're going to correct that wrong. And some like it. Some people it's like this insulting idea to a lot of other people, they celebrate it because they're like, hey, if it's for sale and I buy it,

Speaker 2:          02:26:20       it's mine. I could see it from both perspectives. German, it's, it's. It's very much like the hunting thing. If you're a part of it, you have a deep history in it. You understand that your perspective of ranching is from a rancher. Whereas people in the outside conveniently can be ignorant about it and go, oh, fuck those ranchers. I want to see the buffalo. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:26:39       In my perspective, my perspective on wildlife has been, it's the thing that you. It's the thing that you care about, your work to conserve. You want to have it on the landscape and you also eat a lot of it out of it.

Speaker 2:          02:26:51       That's a foreign idea. Yeah, it is. I'm glad that you can't sell wild game. I'm glad that mark and hunting is not a thing. However, I would really love it if there was a restaurant where you could go where you could buy like really well prepared wild game dishes, like a really well prepared bear. Really well prepared mountain lion, well prepared, you know, fill in the blank with the animal. I just think that would be a fascinating place to eat, you know, and maybe maybe if they could do something like that, it wouldn't be that you could actually sell the meat. I mean there have to be some weird work around it. Have to be like someone have to come to one of my dinner parties. I would have. No, that's fine. But I mean, but I would like it if there was a place where the general public could participate in it, I think they'd get a better understanding and like I put up these posts all the time of elk that I cook and people like, God damn, I want to eat some of that.

Speaker 2:          02:27:49       I eat that. How do you eat that? You got to go get one of them. You know? I mean, it's the only way you can eat that. Yeah. Well you can buy. Come to my house. Yeah, you can go and buy the farm raised version, but then that's one. Yeah. Good luck getting a farm raised blueberry, black bear. Yeah. Well No, not that case, but like, you know, you could buy, but then it's, that's a whole other conversation around the captive service industry. But yeah, you can buy, you can buy elk that are raised on a ranch environment. Right? Yeah. I mean as long as you're getting it from New Zealand, you're not dealing with cwd in lot of the other issues that they're dealing with in America. Right?

Speaker 4:          02:28:23       Well, yeah, but I mean they're, you know, those places are tested in herds that have cwd Nmr destroyed. Right. Um,

Speaker 2:          02:28:33       yeah, but the. Well the whole New Zealand thing, there was an interesting thing that you brought up on your podcast recently. Um, how New Zealand, they've been talks about actual eradication and one of the arguments that hunters always use is, hey, we're controlling the population. This is a good service that we're providing. And then the government comes along and says, well how about we take care of that? And everybody's like, Hey, well not so fast.

Speaker 4:          02:28:56       Yeah, it's a that takes place in Australia and New Zealand where they have these like thriving very robust populations of non native wildlife and the government has all, does, has always and does now do a lot of calling of these animals. They don't have predators, right? They have like extremely, like they're very fecund, extremely high reproductive rates and they, the government is actively engaged, you know, around the clock gunning wildlife from helicopters shooting, just letting it run and shoot and leave it to rot because you have to because they're trying. You have to. But they do that because they're trying to protect certain ecosystems and keep like a lot of native plant species from going extinct and fragile environments and all kinds of reasons. Like said there's no death, right? There's no, there's no credit. There's no Predator control on. Which is huge. And in a lot of places, just completely inadequate amount of hunting and a thing that hunters have eyes been able to say in Australia.

Speaker 4:          02:29:59       New Zealand as they've been in a little too with an a in a culture where, particularly in Australia, like a culture that seems to be not as friendly toward hunters as they are in America. You're able to say, well, you know, we're participating in wildlife control. And then later when people come up and they talk about, well, you know what, we're going to get serious about this and we're going to really actively with a goal of like totally eliminating these species. People are justifiably made uneasy about it because it's a, it's a thing that they've come to appreciate and rely on in a resource that they want to use. And now they're like, whoa, wait a minute. Oh, kill them all. I do like them being here and it winds up putting you in this weird. Like it winds up putting you in a, in a weird rhetorical position.

Speaker 4:          02:30:46       But I understand where they're coming from because if, um, if you could live there and you could agree that we're going to have some small number of them on the landscape and then we're going to use those and we're going to hunt those. And eat those. Um, I also, if someone said, hey, they're gone now, I would be bummed. Yeah. I Hunt Turkeys that I was saying earlier. We had turkeys in 39 states at the time of European contact. We have turkeys and for United States now I hunt Turkeys and a lot of those 10 states that didn't historically have turkeys and that do now. And I generally have a perspective of trying to preserve native wildlife and trying to control non natives because I don't want to wind up with sort of a like monolithic wildlife pattern or the same super resilient adaptive species such as Canada geese and rats and white tail deer take over the entire country and pigs.

Speaker 4:          02:31:29       So you're like, yes, I want like the variety. So I'm generally like, antagonistic toward non natives. But if someone came and said I'm okay, you know what, we're going to actually go in and kill off all the turkeys. And those 10 states that historically didn't have turkeys, I would say like how, you know really because I've kind of grown to really like those turkeys and they're not really causing a problem. Right. And I think that some people, you know, if the New Zealand hunter and Australian Hunter, I don't think anyone's arguing, there should be no control, but I think that they're like, let's find a balance. I think we can find a balance with, there's some availability animals on the landscape since they've been here since the beginning of our, you know, experience on this continent. Uh, if there's some availability of animals, that's fine. Like a reasonable compromise here. Well that was one of the discussions as well about Hawaii, right? Like, and some of the Hawaiian islands eradicating the pigs. And then the Hawaiians were saying, well, they've been here as long as us. Yeah, we've both been here that our ancestors have been here 1100 years. They brought the pig with them. How am I a native Hawaiian? And the pig has the go. There's like, maybe you people ought to go.

Speaker 4:          02:32:40       I always like again, man, I always instinctively when I hear stuff I instinctively lean in on. I instinctively lean in from the perspective of, you know, instinctively lean in from the perspective of the hunter and Angler, you know, and like, and, and I love all these little debates and I think that they're all really helpful and interesting. But um, no, I feel like I can recognize their pain and that can also look far away and, and laugh at the absurdity of it. Like I even had a guy write me from Australia and say this is a real bummer because it exposes us to the thing where we got to say like, yeah, you know what, I wasn't really just doing it because I'm trying to help the ecosystem by eliminating non natives. Um, I actually like having someone around and now I just got to come out and say that. And that's a bummer.

Speaker 4:          02:33:33       I wish. I really do wish there was some sort of a restaurant. I think there would be a great place for people to get a perspective. There's no way to do that though, Huh? No, but I know there's not. Well, I mean, not for all the things that you're talking about now and I don't, and I don't look too, um, there is talk of a lot of people are looking to um, are, are pushing for this idea that in areas that have too many white tail deer, um, there's people who are really pushing to reopen up the sale of, of wild harvested dear as a solution to dear overpopulation. But um, but for me from the perspective, from my perspective and from the damage that was caused by unregulated wildlife slaughter, I'm just, I'm very, very uneasy with it and I do not picture myself ever coming around and supported the idea that we would start marketing a, that we would start marketing wild cervids

Speaker 2:          02:34:33       no, I agree. And I think that just the sheer possibility of fuckery and people shooting them and coaching them and selling them and it's just,

Speaker 4:          02:34:44       and, and just, it's a, it would increase the commodification of wildlife. Yeah. Um, and, and that's something that, and that's something that I'm also just uncomfortable with in general, the commodification of wildlife and I think about resource availability for hunters. And I think that a lot of people who enjoy access to certain areas now to go hunting to, to like hunt for themselves and their family that the minute you made it be that those deer had a dollar value attached to them, there'll be a lot less opportunity for people who choose to hunt to feed themselves because it will all of a sudden be like, why would I let you come in or allow you to come in and use a resource when I'm just going to do my best now to collect it up and sell it. Yeah. And so again, for aesthetic reasons, for what it would mean for hunters, for our, our perception of our relationship with our resources that I'm extremely uncomfortable with the ice cube. It's an idea that keeps popping up because we have in some areas, um, and I, and I usually, I hate to say that I hate top of ours. Too many deer. There's too much this, too much debt because like by WHO's measurement. But in some areas we really do, especially when you start getting into the, to issues like lyme disease prevalence and ticks. And starvation and then just the possibility of other disease outbreaks and the spread of certain wildlife diseases. There's some areas that like by any reasonable measurement. We have too many deer.

Speaker 2:          02:36:14       Yeah. Um, well look, it's already 1:00. Oh, how crazy is that? Time flies in this room. Your podcast is awesome. It really is. I'm glad to talk to you to doing it. I owe it all to you and I. and every chance I get, I point to it. I appreciate it. I really do appreciate that you do it because I think it's, it's my favorite podcast to recommend to people that want, if I want them to get an understanding of hunting without even watching it. Just listening to you talk about because he has. He have so many guests on where he might not even be talking about hunting. You might be talking about biology, might be talking about history. You know, it's a, it's just a great podcast and you're a great guy for the job. You, you play a very important part out there. I really, really believe that.

Speaker 4:          02:37:01       Thank you. I appreciate it and I'm glad you talked me to doing it has been a in terms of all the things I do, the TV writing is the thing that I enjoy doing it the, it was a lot of things I enjoy having done it more. Right. But the thing that I enjoy actually doing it, I'm deciding like a smile on my face doing it. What year is such a great

Speaker 5:          02:37:24       talker? I mean, remember the first time you did my podcast even before mediator, when you were just coming off of the wild. Within. What is it? Is that what it's called? Yeah, and I remember thinking, why does this guy have a fucking podcast? And this is how many years ago, seven years ago, something like that.

Speaker 4:          02:37:39       Do you know the first time I ever heard the word podcast? This is good. This is embarrassing. The first time I ever heard the word podcast was Helen Cho telling me that I should go on Joe Rogan's podcast and I didn't know what it meant. That's how early you were into this shit,

Speaker 4:          02:37:53       into this shit before I ever heard the word. Wow, that's crazy. Um, I want, I can, I kind of doubled back around and plug my book again. Yeah, please do. Okay. So it's called the meat eater, fishing game, cookbook, recipes and techniques for every hunter and Angler. Got a picture of that, Jamie, a Bam. There it is. I say one last quick thing about it. It releases right now, releases this week on November 20, but it's available for preorder everywhere and it's um, broken into a bunch of chapters where it has big game, small game like rabbits, hares, squirrels, upland birds, waterfowl, fresh water or salt water, fish, Shell, fish and crustaceans, reptiles and amphibians. So all your bullfrog stuff is in there and you want to talk about a species. It's spreading all across the country. Bull 60. Really? Yeah, I've hunted a lot of bullfrogs and places where they're very unwelcome. What do you hunt them with? Um, a variety of ways. Most of your frog Gig, I don't care where you live, like there's a lot of people that live in a city. Like, dude, I'd love to go out and get some wild game. I can't read the elk. I, how do I do that? You could be out gigging frogs at night, no one would even know

Speaker 4:          02:39:00       frog gigging crayfish grab and we talked about all this kind of stuff in the book so it explains everything from how to like break down and process and freeze stuff. And then for everything there are many recipes and the recipes walk you through how to use the entire thing. So are you from for refer your white tail deer. Everything from the tongue to the rear shank,

Speaker 4:          02:39:23       how like specific recipes on how to do it. And also, um, just general best practices and guidelines around how to handle the ingredients and then all the stuff around all the substitutions. So there's no such thing as an elkhart recipe. Riots like how to like handle game hearts, whether it's meal deer, white tail, whatever, like how to approach a heart and a in a, in an attitude toward wild game that is not, that's cut specific. Not Species specific. And with fish too, like I don't, I'm not with the idea of those is a walleye recipe here. This is a bluegill recipe, but how to handle like varieties of fresh water, fish and like what kind of, what kind of recipes you can use that are interchangeable depending on where you live and what you use and all includes all that and the real pretty pictures. Beautiful.

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       You can see Yonis Patellas how to do the tail skinning Methadone Squirrel. And I don't care where you live. You damn sure. Live near squirrels. People. Very uncomfortable. Squirrel eaten, not me. Oh, and you know in the end, the guy that got the disease means girl brains. Yeah. Nothing to do with scroll brains. Oh No. The article I sent you. Yeah. What, what did he. Everybody sent me that article. Yeah. There's, there's no demonstrable correlations. Like 30 peep, 30 Americans a year, you know, wind up with that form of crumps felt 30 Americans wind up with. It just happens to be this dude's sometime in his past. It's in some sort of. It's a are prion disease and it's the same thing Hamza people, but, but it was the correlation between his diet and what happened to him was implied. Implied put possible. If you go read up on it, it now seems like people are really saying like, there's no, there's no obvious relationship here.

Speaker 1:          02:41:18       No obvious relationship between eating squirrel brains and getting a prion disease. Yeah. There's plenty of people that get the same thing that haven't been eating squirrel brains. Right. So just, they were just looking at the unusual aspects of his diet and pointing to that. And it's not that scientific. Yeah. And the, the article got a lot more love when it was at some squirrel hundred died from eating squirrel brains than it did when the later subsequent pieces came out. Wherever it is like, whoa. Yeah, we don't really like girls are cute. Yeah. I ate some squirrel with you. Just the thing, you've very good. There's not a person in the world. You know what we have in the, in the cookbook is we have um, how to do buffalo, buffalo wings, hot wings, how to do hot legs with squirrels were unit the Arni. Really?

Speaker 1:          02:42:05       Yeah. So it's just like you making rules on shooting squirrels. Um, they vary state by state. Yeah. So if, if you're in New York, you know, you have a season, um, you know, squirrel season in most states, so it's either, it's either one or the other way, either there's a season in a bag limit or the treated as a non game species. So here in California there's a squirrel season. It was a bag of, I think it's for a day for four squirrels a day. When's the season? You know, seasons usually run from sometime in August, in September into winter, into January, February. So where I grew up September 15th, September eighth to January, 27th. Archery. Falconry only Jesus crest. So archery and foul, foul Kinnari. So August four for archery and falconry. Falconry falcons. Then you got to go to the tree squirrels zone map, right? But in your estate Jack rabbits are open. For instance, your State Jack Rabbits are managed as non gaming. There's no bag limit in open year round snow, like a cottontails. No issues have different management and a lot of states pine squirrels are red squirrels, which aren't commonly hunted,

Speaker 4:          02:43:11       but they're more regarded as like things that get into people's houses, but they're not 100 for me, they'd be listed as a non game species, but Fox girls and gray squirrels, v as game species. So in New York, I think the bag limit when I was living there was six per day, a possession limit of two bag limits. Did you shoot any squirrels in Brooklyn and need them? No. No, when I caught some there and ate them, but I would hunt out of the city at my buddy's farm and some other places. So where I was born in Michigan, the squirrel season was September 15th and it ran into a van to January five squirrels a day. Possession limit of two bag limits. The state I live in now treat squirrels as non game species. So there's no close season, no bag limit because there's not really a, there's not a, they're not widely distributed and they're not commonly haunted.

Speaker 4:          02:44:04       All right. But uh, yeah, most places they have them and they're managed. And you go out and buy a small game license for 12 bucks or whatever. Get your hunter safety, get yourself a 22 or a or a shotgun. And you can become a squirrel man or a squirrel lady like you buddy. Kevin Murphy, one of my favorite guys on your podcast. He's a squirrel man. This guy blows a horn in the woods before every hunt to alert the animals that he's coming. Yeah. You blow. Yeah. He carries a cow horn around the, I think um, it's in, uh, a show far, right? Is that right? For. And when you blow the Shofar and like a Jewish synagogue, is that what it is? Thanks. Called a chauffeur. Like you've blown the rams. They below a Ram's horn. It's not, it's not a cow, a cow harm. It's ran, you know, the end of um, you know, in the end have no country for old men. Yeah. Have we talked about this before? He talks about his father riding out ahead of him or the Horn of fire

Speaker 4:          02:45:10       in the end when you get, he relates the dream. It's in the book and it's in the movie for the Tommy Lee Jones characters describing a dream in which they're riding through a snow storm and his father rides ahead with a Horn of fire. And I was wondering how many people heard that and had no idea what he was talking about. But what a common practice used to be as you take a horn buffalo horn, cow horn. And it's hollow because, um, it grows off of protrusion of the skull called the horn core. And you pop the horn off and it's hollow. And what people will do is when you left your campfire in the morning, you would fill that horn with embers and cap it, but there'd be a little pinhole in it just to let a little bit of air and air so it could continue to smolder. And you carry that Horn all day full of embers. And at night to start a new fire, you would dump the horn out and rekindle your fire. So when he talks about his father riding out ahead of them with a Horn of fire, what that's meant to say is that he knew his father will be waiting out ahead of with

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       a fire burning. Whoa. Yeah. But Kevin Murray just blows it. Let squirrels. Noise worries. Thanks for coming, man. Always good to talk to you. We keep saying we've got to organize another hunt. We have to give the love. You have to do something. Call Brian Cowen. I talked to him recently. We'll make it happen. He's one of the phone. Your guys on Instagram, man. He's one of the funniest guys alive.

Speaker 7:          02:46:35       Bye everybody.
