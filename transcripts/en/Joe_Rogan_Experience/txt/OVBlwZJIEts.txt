Speaker 1:          00:06:29       In fact a supplements as far as far as our supplements go. We just try to find what is the stuff that has science behind it was the stuff that has actual scientific references we could read up and try to figure out what, you know, there's a lot of Hullabaloo. Let us Hooli when it comes to supplements and there's a loss of a lot of opinions. One of the things that you find is there's a lot of people that like to say that, you know, certain supplements known, do anything. Uh, Alpha brain is especially a controversial because it is a new tropic supplement. What nootropic is the idea is that it enhances cognitive function. Of course, that's kind of controversial. So because of that we have performed not one, but when we did one, we're in the middle of a second one, a second clinical trial plus blind double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, positive results from the first one.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       We're very excited about it. Um, there's also references on all of the different ingredients. There's been studies done on all the different, uh, aspects of Alpha brain, but we wanted to prove that the improvement, uh, wasn't just, uh, based on the individual ingredients, but they had a synergistic effect. So we're very excited about the positive results and we're very excited also that all of our supplements, whether it's Alpha brain or, um, shroom tech sport, which I have never heard a single negative thing about. It's based on the court steps mushroom and the quarter steps mushroom is something that the Chinese Olympic team used to a achieve a Olympic gold medals. I don't know. It's a good question. Okay. I could read that. 37. I'd rather just go through it. Why 37 was about a year. I had a rough, really rough anyway, this, this commercials too long.

Speaker 2:          00:08:57       the Joe Rogan experience. Joe Rogan podcast by night. All Day. My man

Speaker 3:          00:09:08       crusher, world traveler. Internationally known locally respected trip flip. How many, how many trips have you done so far? Uh, 30 40 40 40. We got another 14 we're doing starting this weekend too. That's a lot of fucking trips. There's a lot of fucking the international trips. And how many years has this been? This is going to be our fourth year. Fourth year this, so 10 international trips a year for four years. Holy Shit Dude. Yeah, that's a lot of fucking ambulance. A lot. Do you know what, just started flying sober. Whoa. The fuck is that about because I just met you. Okay, look, I like partying and I'm like getting down, but it's just like by myself on a plane. Me Drinking Ad Nauseum, it's just not healthy. And have you gotten more comfortable with flying that you're able to achieve this? It started, I took a flight to Hawaii with the girls and Leanne was like, let's try it and I, and I don't want it, didn't want to get hammered on the plane with the girl's way and normally do on a flight to Hawaii.

Speaker 3:          00:09:57       So I didn't drink and I just, and I got there and I was like, oh, I took his hand. I took a half a Xanax. Yeah, we talked about this, the last podcast actually. And then I've been working on it and so like I like our fly, I'll be with red bound Thursday night in uh, in San Diego. And then we, I fly in Friday morning to Phoenix. I can do that sober. That's a quick flight. And then I fly back to San Diego. I can do that sober. And then so short flights, I'm good at long ones from Miami. I have a hard time, six hours, six hours I start getting in my head because then I'm like, what happened one time was I was on a flight ticket from New York to La. And like halfway through we are in really bad turbulence and there's no way, there's no instant gratification.

Speaker 3:          00:10:32       I can't put a Xanax in my mouth and it just kick in. Right? So like, so there's no instant gratification. I know I have like half a Xanax in my body, so I'm like, fuck it, I'll drink. I don't, and I know that's bad, but I was like, I'm going to have a beer and then it'll heighten the Xanax. But then I felt like I was having a heart attack, so I was like, motherfucker on those flights I got to roll the dice and pick Xanax. So I go through like a weather map and I looked to see what the weather is on the flight la. And if it's bad, I'm just like, this is a drinking flight. And I get that. So this is a drinking flight. And I get that there's no way around it. There's no way around it. It starts in Miami airport and it's like, yeah, I don't like to drink on praise, but praise.

Speaker 3:          00:11:06       I don't like to drink on planes, but I have and I've achieved some excellent moments. Like I've had some real fun on planes being drunk and also real good writing got done on planes. I would like to drink Budweiser for some reason, which I don't normally drink, but I like aluminum cans of Budweiser. I like aluminum cans of Heinikin full. Can I say, give me the one and I don't want to get a portrait. I want the, can I say that I'm very specific. Well you went under the best feeling to right as my, like my, this is my fucking moment by zone is if I cannot drink, uh, for, uh, for any of the part of like the, any of the pre board, any of that. And then I get one beer before takeoff and then I take off of the one beer. My system, I start fucking firing.

Speaker 3:          00:11:52       Cause I've, I have the fear of death. I have the life. I had the life going on like, Hey, this could all end right now, but I'm like, it's not, I know it's not Gunna, but then I just start jamming out material and I just write like panicked. Like I, at one point I wrote on, I was like first time I did it was all done and Napkins and on the everything I was writing on everything. It was for a roast I did for cow head, said Bam and it out. That's a really good feeling. Yeah. There's something about being in a plane that gives you that heightened state of vulnerability that makes your your creativity sort of fire up a little bit. I wrote my book, I wrote my book on a plane. I was on plane flights to Australia, to Switzerland, to Italy to Scotland and I just get on and I just started drinking and just bang it out, write drunk, edit sober.

Speaker 3:          00:12:34       So I get in my hotel room that next day and be like, all right, let's take a look at what I wrote. I could not read at at time. I was like, I know this story was this chicken it. Do you write longhand? Do you write typing? I write better typing, but for jokes I love the art of, I'm a little, I don't have it on me, but like do you see like, uh, like I love to like, like this past weekend I increased the size of my, my road book because I wanted big cause I want to really like focus. I feel like I'm wasting my forties by just fucking around on stage. I want to really write and know what I'm writing and work on that material and make it better. What do you mean by wasting? Like one where I get this? Uh, I love the live by the sword, die by the sword moment on stage.

Speaker 3:          00:13:15       I love taking chances and I love experimenting. The problem is I'm not paying any of that off. So it's not like that's, it's like a, imagine if I loved fighting, but all it's doing is doing bar room barfly street fall. It fights, you know, like, and I didn't take Jujitsu classes and put it to some sort of use. So that's what I feel like I'm doing on stage is I'm having a good time and they're amazing shows and they are one of a kind. But if I do have a moment of really good writing, I'm not then taking it and doing the real work of sitting in the green room and writing what worked, taping my set. So I just started taping my sets and going, all right. But those little tiny notebooks, I have a hard time, like they're good for your pocket by have a hard time getting inspired to write in it like, but those big ones I do.

Speaker 3:          00:13:58       So like I'll write a big letter and then really right around the letter, like almost like it's an old school book from like the, you know, like the 18 hundreds. So that's what I've been doing. So you, I use those little books that go in the pockets. I use those for just right before I go on stage notes. Like I write out like set lists and stuff like that or new ideas that I can't let go. I write them down on that. But uh, I'm, I'm with you. I write most of my stuff on a computer, but I like to like write long hand for memory. Yeah. I just started my eye. It's impossible to write a book, obviously shorthand, but I found the quick, did his, are you serious? Longhand? They call it, you know, it's not shortening the shorthand. Is that weird? Um, you know that weird you ever seen shorthand? Like it's called Gregg Gregg shorthand. It's like a that they used to use tonight. Rivers, courts, demographers and um, no, I don't think they use a typing. Yeah, you're right. They have some weird typing method,

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       but reporters would use it. Yeah. There was an article about it recently because, um, I always knew about it. I never understood it, but I, um, I was reading this article about this new product that I just picked up. I still haven't implemented it yet, but what it is, is a pen that is an MP three recorder and it also takes photographs of your notes. So say if we were doing this podcast and I had the piece of paper, what I would do is you would say something. I would say, Oh shit, Xanax on a plane. And I would write it down like I had an idea or there was something that we both said that I knew that I need to revisit or whatever. And then if I wanted to go over my notes afterwards I go to the pen and I can put the pen over the note and it would play the recording that was going on as I wrote the note.

Speaker 3:          00:15:38       Fuck yes. Isn't that crazy? That's fucking, oh, that's personally wizard shit, dude. Let me tell you what exactly what you know what that's good for. Oh, that's a good for a lot of shit. I was trying to think. I'm trying to, I try to remember my dreams, like a excited, really fucking insane dreams and I think that you can find out some, some sort of your subconscious creativity throughout your dreams.

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       Yeah. Yeah. I think that would be, oh well, let's see. The thing about this is that it records, you know, the idea is that you're recording an MP. It's really for like people doing interviews, like that's one of the best things for it. But it's like if we were doing an interview, I'd have a pen, I'd be able to write down what you're saying or write notes down on what you're saying. But I would have the entire room

Speaker 3:          00:16:20       courting who it's not going to, you can't find your pen and you just write the tail end and you're hurt and you heard. And that's how I cured aids. And you're like, dammit, I should have written the beginning of this. Yeah, let me find this thing. Just so everybody knows what we're all here. It's called, it's called the live scribe sky Wifi pen. It's very, very interesting. I just signed up for fucking nature box while you're doing your ads. I just bought six months. Those seraching things and the bluebird thing sold me. So tell me this one. I'll buy this one. It's called the live scribe.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       Um, and it's, uh, it works on Wifi. Um, this one, the one that I got is eight gigabytes and uh, it's incredible, man. It's really an amazing invention. I say this having not used it even once, but uh, it has uh, uh, very high reviews on online from reporters and from folks who use that. My idea is that I'm going to start using it for, uh, for podcasts because I have all these notes like, you know, that are all scribbled in and I go over them at the end of the week and try to find it. Cause every now and then one of these will become a bit, you know, one of these things that I say is worth, um, like here, vampires colonizing Mars. Oh, preppers. I Dunno what the fuck that means. I have no idea. But if I had the pen, I could go over that and it would tell me the exact thing we were talking about. What vampires are colonizing Mars.

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       If you get a pen or with the David Tell joke where you get a parrot. Zody said, I, he goes, I ain't go. By the way, here's what I'm done doing. I'm done. Idolizing the guys that I idolized out loud. Like I, I think Jim Norton is one of my favorite comics. No world did. Then he came over to my podcast, I should have just sucked his dick for an hour because literally I sat there and I was like, I just posted it today and it's getting like tons of hits. But everyone's like one hour, like, like they were like, you really were blown because I love Opie and Anthony and I listened to the show all the time. I love tough, tough crowd. Right? And I listened to him on your podcast, which was fucking amazing. And then he came over to my house and I'm like, can you tell the story that you told what I felt like a child?

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       Well, he's, you know, I, I know what you're talking about. It's hard when you have genuine admiration or you know, you, you want to express it, but you're trying to figure out how to not be like so fan boyish and just get over it. But that's also part of the enthusiasm of being not just a comic, but a fan of comedy. You know, you're a fan of it.

Speaker 3:          00:18:49       Huge Fan. I'm more, I would say sometimes I'm more a fan than a comedian. Like cause I love, I love laughing, I love laughing. I go online and I'll watch videos fucking all night long. I watched Patrice has elephant in the room. I might watch that once a month. No lie.

Speaker 1:          00:19:07       You know what my favorite joke on that as man, one of my favorite bits, I think it's from elephant in the room when he talks about what position is open or girls get mad, you know that you know, I want more out of this relationship. I want this and things like that. That position is not open. And it was like when you go for a job, you don't say, I want to be the CEO of a company. What that position is not open. The position that's open is I come over two o'clock in the morning, you suck my Dick, I drink your last Snapple. That position's open. It's fucking such a good bit. My favorite. It's so like defines and when, especially when you're single and you know every man and woman who has ever been single has those moments where you're with someone where you like, yeah, this could go away and I'll be all right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:50       You know, like girls need sex just like guys do. Don't play games. I did to grow who admitted to me that she was using me for sex. I go, I am cool with that. You know, let's just, we got it all out in the table. Let's just use it like that. But you know, there's people that get into situations where you feel that way but they want marriage, they want you to be the number one and they'll make you feel bad. Like you're doing something wrong. Like you're a piece of shit because you don't want what they want. And then Patrice, the way he like labeled it out, they're like, no, that position is not available here. Here's what positions available there. Tell me if you want. It

Speaker 3:          00:20:28       makes that joke genius in my opinion. And I love those. This is what I loved about Patrice was the, the truth of it. The, the fact that that is actually all and you know it's true because you know he drank her last snap. That's the best part of that joke cause a lot of comics would just leave it as the piston is open ones where you suck

Speaker 4:          00:20:48       my dick. Right. Cause you think it would end big. Right. That's a big hard word. But the one paid trees Patrice great was and I drink your last step that adds the flavor. You know it's like the extra spice in the stew. It's like Dwayne, he said my favorite joke on that whole special is a, he's like, oh I like, I didn't know how important things are going to be. Like I never learned how to type. And he was like I didn't, I was too busy calling people gay. We're going to steal lunch. Me Bitch. And he's like, and now I can't type so I can't talk to anybody because you don't realize how am I remember taking typing classes and going and exactly what he said. I'm not going to be a secretary cause that's when we were kids. If you took typing and you're good at it, you're like great, you'd be a secretary.

Speaker 4:          00:21:28       That was it. That's how will the world was set up. You didn't realize everyone would need to learn how to type. I do not think it's that hard to learn how to type. I had no problem wearing a hat, a type. I didn't take typing in school. I didn't take it. I learned how to type. I learned how to type because I've got a computer in college and then worked like, but it was hard. Why was picking and poking for like the first couple of years? Then I got one of those Mavis baking can typing programs. Do you ever done that? No. That's awesome. Um, I don't even know if they still make it, but what it was was essentially a program you would run, you'd run it on a CD Rom and it was a game and it would be like, it would tell you to press the r and you press are like, it was like you're racing and like the are would come up and you'd have to press the od, the tea would come up, you press the t and you're supposed to do it all without looking and it shows you on the keyboard where your finger should go.

Speaker 4:          00:22:11       And so you just do it and then eventually you kind of know where the are is, where the t is, your, your fingers are on the j and the F and you know, you figure it out and you just learn how to type. And it didn't take long. I mean I type now really clearly. I type fast, I don't look at the keyboard. I type pretty good. Brian to this day, he's like, oh, can you believe we can tell you without looking at the keyboard, it's bullshit. I'm like, you've been typing as long as me, you lazy. Fuck. Just learn at a type. Like you're saying it. Like I wish I could breathe underwater. It's not like hard stuff to do. I mean I did it. It was not an effort. It wasn't like, oh my God, I can't believe I'm still doing this and I can't type.

Speaker 4:          00:22:49       I can type without looking, but then I have to go back and make sure I did the right letters. Really. Like, cause I, if I start typing I can do it. I can totally do it. But then I got to look at it and go, okay, you're looking at if you're typing without looking, you're looking at the words. No, I meant, I meant like looking away. Oh. Like I can type and look at the page but like I can't, I can't like type and look away and then type like I have to look, I have to be seeing that I'm writing the right letters. Yeah, I, well I definitely think I don't, I have typed like having a conversation with someone and it'd be okay. But yeah, you want to look like at the actual screen as you're typing. What I mean is like looking down at the keyboard, hunting and pecking and I had a disastrous situation once with this guy. I got paired up with a head of development deer and they paired me up with this guide or to write a script and uh, there's a lot of things wrong with this dude. He was going to full blown panic attacks when we have meetings. I mean full blown panic attacks where he couldn't talk. He had these crazy anxiety

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       attacks. Um, and uh, the other thing was he couldn't type and I couldn't believe it. I'm like, you're, you're a professional writer and you can't type. And he's like, well, you know, writing is about creativity. I go, it's about putting me in a little, put it down on paper while you're still thinking about it. Yeah. Like he couldn't, I mean it was the war. It was like he just started typing today. It wasn't just like he was bad at pecking a poking cause hunters Thompson picked and poked the day he died. But he would, you know, he had this thing where he would do it and you know he figured out how to write books by pecking and poking. It means, it's funny if you ever seen video of hunter s Thompson typing. No, but I feel like I have Jamie. Thanks. See if he can find a video of hunters Thompson typing cause it was kind of funny. He would just get these two index fingers and just charging. He had this, it's kind of spastic thing. You would do his arms up in the air and it was, it was really intense.

Speaker 3:          00:24:32       I could probably lose three fingers and still type cause I think I only use like this one and my two thumbs, my two pointers and like one up here. I don't think I use all things. I don't use pinkies.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       I use all of them. Really? Yeah. You get that typing program man, you should do it. It'll help you a lot. It'll definitely make you type quicker. I know they have some typing programs. I don't know if they still have the Mavis Bacon, but that's what I,

Speaker 3:          00:24:53       I need to learn how to read out loud. But

Speaker 1:          00:24:55       this is a mother fucker was packing and Pocan and um, he also would, would have the, I mean I got it from fear and loading. Oh, there. Okay. Well this is sort of a, an imitation of it by Johnny Depp. This is sort of like how he would type and this is Johnny Depp doing it in five years. It's him playing liner as Thompson. You'd probably pull this down and then we're going to get fucking pulled off of youtube anyway. Probably already pulled that one off. We were wanting money from you. You've referenced something in pop culture. Um, but this dude was a professional writer, couldn't write and would go. He's a pitch meeting guy. It's supposed to be a pitch of any guy. Full panic attacks. I mean, panic attack. So we'll have the, uh, the, uh, the Paul of the plot, the politic apologize. You know, Joe's a guy who was all working in this one applies and, and I'd be looking at him like, oh, Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       And I didn't want to interrupt and break in because he's also, it's very awkward when you're there and someone's talking about you like your qualities, like what's good about you. But I'm like, this is pointless. This is a way this meeting is done. It's over. It's over. As soon as you start stammering, they're not going to give you a show to run you fucking stammering. Fuck, I can't you shit together. Take a meditation class or something. I'm going to breathe. He also used to do warm up when he was a comic quit comedy. Couldn't, couldn't handle the comment anymore, but it had like this weird bitterness towards other comedians. It was very odd. But he told me that he was in the middle of a warmup once for a, well, let's just not say the name of the guy he was warming up for because we might've already told this story and giving up the information, but just in case I don't want his name to get out there. Yeah. He would work for this. A big name guy, a Sit-com guy who just happened to be black. And um, as he was warming up the crowd, he had this panic attack where he got it in his head.

Speaker 3:          00:26:47       Yup. Did I tell you this? Nope. I heard it on the podcast and I ha I listened to your podcast walking through New York and you told a story and I'm walking to a presentation of corporate presentation where I am the host and I literally went, you mother fucker. And all my brain said was giggling. Yeah. What the guy said

Speaker 1:          00:27:07       his, he got this idea in his head, don't say nigger for no reason, but like when folks have anxiety issues or when folks have mental issues that, that, that, that can happen. You can get a hitch like, uh, like for whatever it is. It good news. It can just get stuck in your head. And for him he couldn't talk and he was doing this warm up and he was just, when it was over, he was just a shaking, sweating mess. And it was just a a wrestling match to not say nigger while he was warming up a sitcom.

Speaker 3:          00:27:42       Basket ball get that'll, I think that'll work for anyone. And you get that in your head and when you have to do a president, I wouldn't let it in. You don't let it did not about God about it. Thank God. But I'm walking in and I've heard you say that and I, when mother Fucker, I don't worry that it could get you, it's a brain thing. I can think myself into an anxiety attack. Can you really? Yeah, I fall. I've thought myself into big ones. So what is an anxiety attack exactly? Like what is the feeling like the first time I ever had when I was white, it was a kid. I was like, probably someone will say, well I was definitely 10 years old. I was probably 12 and I was watching Johnny Carson and all I could feel like, was it? He was shouting at me and his head was real tiny, like the like from beetle juice.

Speaker 3:          00:28:25       His head was tiny and he was just shouting. Yeah. And I was like, I was like freaking out and I went to my dad's room. I was like, I can't, I think I'm going to die. And he was, my dad said go back to bed. And I was like, okay great, I'll just white knuckle this night and then fucking and so then I and I, but I didn't know what it was. And then the next time I had one where I realized I realized one day I will die and I went, what? Like it got real heavy, everything seems real clear. And then not, you start spiraling, you get like a blinders on, it's heels, you've got blinders on and everything kind of gets tunnel vision and you lose kind of like everything feels like uneasy and you can feel your heart race. I mean it happens differently for every person, but I've kind of struggled with them a little bit and I would get them on planes.

Speaker 3:          00:29:05       That's why I started drinking on planes. But I can think myself into a panic attack. Like last time I was here, I was, I was going through one cause remember I was like I have a pain in my side. That was a panic attack. No, no, but it was one that had been building throughout the time and I was like motherfucker where you just start thinking about it and then you lay in bed at night and your head, you have no control of your thoughts. How much exercise do you do? A lot right now. A lot. Right now. A lot. I'm running, I'm doing, I told you I had got battle ropes. Um, yeah I should have googled you before I started using them by just tried to just fucking nuts without them attached to anything and I just basically bullet in the head with a fucking

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       40 pound road. I held on to both like, like I was out running a stage coach. Okay. Joe and just went and the rope just came and my daughter's watching and the rope came back and I just turned it last minute, hit me in the side of the head and I hit the ground. And you were just like, are you okay? And then, um, as I'm laying on the ground, I'm like, motherfucker and George, he goes, I don't think that's how you're supposed to use them. I was like, yeah, I know. It's why I texted you. And you're like, put them onto a kettle bells. Like should have texted you before I started doing dumbbell or you can wrap them around a tree. Even I put them on, I put them on a Kettlebell and then to put them on my grass and you know, helps me loosen up.

Speaker 4:          00:30:17       I have a bad back and it helps loosen up my back. I had an anxiety attack one weekend I was in Syracuse and I listened to Bas Rutten one about his arm and I started, I started figuring, cause I've had this back problem from riding rollercoasters I was like, what if I get that sound? And you know, you've got a fucked up job, dude. Your job is, I mean you've taken so many people on roller coasters, the other bed back, put your hands up. That's so crazy. It doesn't even make sense. Like you might be the only guy ever. He has a fucked up back from riding roller coasters. You start spiraling and you're like get tendonitis in your elbow and you're like, mother fucker. I was like, and then I ran into do that like next week and I was like, Joe, talk to me about back issues.

Speaker 4:          00:30:56       And you were like, but like some people are prone to anxiety. I think it has to do a lot with your diet. That has to do a lot with your exercise. Like when I'm not exercising, I'm fucking gone. I have a theory that the body is in some ways like a magnet for energy. It stores up energy and if you don't push that energy out, it starts freaking out. It doesn't know what, at least my body. I mean my, my only theories based on my personal experiences and the way my body works is if I don't exert energy in a very powerful way, like um, like a hard cardio, like hard lifting, running hills or something like that where I like really blow it out. If I don't do that several days a week, I get these moments where I, I know that like my body wants to do something and it wants to like overreact to things, you know?

Speaker 4:          00:31:46       And I feel like that's what a lot of people say. Like, oh that guy's got a bad temper. I guarantee you a lot of what people have is just, we call it a bad temper, but a lot of his poor management of your energy resources and that you haven't blown out that energy and sort of this way where your body is at an event. It's not cause otherwise your body kind of overflows with this excess stress, anxiety or stress or energy. And if you, I forced myself just like I forced myself to brush my teeth. I enjoy it. I enjoy working out, but it's a, it's an, I'm not getting away from it. I have to do it because I don't necessarily, I don't like, it's not that I don't like me when I'm not exercising, but I don't like me as much and I create more problems. I create more problems in my personal life. I create more problems with how I relate to people. I create more problems when I'm, when I'm just stressed and I've always

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       had this thing where I would go long periods of time, like I'll go a week without working out just because I'm too fucking busy. I can't do it, but I don't accept that anymore. I've, over the last few years, especially this last year, I completely s that's now no longer an option because I'm not at my best. I'm not at my best as a human being. I'm not at my best as a dad. I'm not at my best as a father or as a husband, rather. I'm not at my best as a podcast or I'm not at my best as a comedian and it can be fixed. It's like something that can be, it's not like I wish I could fly like, no, I can work out. I can just, I can just do it, you know? So I forced myself. Now I get 100% absolutely. There's not a week that goes by that I don't work out. I make sure I get it in.

Speaker 3:          00:33:23       I just read a really interesting article about sleep and there were, it was a sleep study and they were saying that they had put a bunch of people that they'd done the test group of like over like four weeks and they did a group at at six hours a group at uh, seven, four hours in a group of eight hours. And they found that like if you slept eight hours, you were exponentially, uh, more active. And then they were saying there that that's why Lebron James Sleeps like 11 hours at night. Cause Cause I've had plantar fasciitis with the feet so I had to like slow down my running and I noticed that I was getting like, I was drinking more because I was depressed because it was like this spiral. And then one night I just, I just didn't drink and I slept solid. Like I slept like nine hours and my feet felt good in the morning and I went whoa, I wonder if it, and then I read this article and it says that your body can't repair itself if it doesn't get into the SMP, sleep or something.

Speaker 3:          00:34:16       Not the rem, but the deep like lower your blood pressure, lower your body temperature, like get yourself out. That's when the body starts repairing itself and like you get sicker easily. And I was like, so when I'm on the road I'm doing these like quick turnarounds, you do it late show Friday, Thursday night and then you got, or to show stores that it's Friday night and you got press or whatever and you're getting like six hours sleep. You're not letting your body repair itself. So that's why your plantar fasciitis comes in. All these ailments that people have now, it's like they got elements where it's like nerve diseases where everyone was just like, like just pain with, I don't, I forget what it's called, but I saw a commercial on it and as I was like, I guarantee you it's a lot of it has to do with sleep. You're totally right.

Speaker 1:          00:34:54       Right. Absolutely. I noticed a big difference between also sleeping all those hours in a row. Like, sometimes I'll have to, I'll have to do something early in the morning and I'll get like four hours sleep and then I'll take a nap in the afternoon. But it's not the same nurse still backed up. It's not the same.

Speaker 3:          00:35:08       And you can't, you can't recatch that deficit. There's, that's the other thing they're saying is that you can't like make up sleep. So once you get it, you just missed it. You just, it's done. It's gone forever. It's like Kaiser San Jose. Well you can get it, but you'd have to do, you know, like they say it's like half time. So like if you know you've missed four hours sleep the night before, he need an extra to the next nine or something like that. Yeah. But you sleep is a huge

Speaker 1:          00:35:29       essential. Tito Ortiz, when he was a champion to sleep 12 hours a day. Yeah, he's to toy. He's training so much. You know, he would go to bed and go to bed at like midnight and wake up at noon. Just sleep. God, yeah, we need it. You need to recover. My kids sleep 12 hours

Speaker 3:          00:35:43       day. My kids sleep late. My kids are like stoners now. Yeah. They like wake up at like 1130 and they're like, oh the fuck, what are we eating? Well, it's summer right now, you know, summertime for kids. It's fucking awesome. I said to me that the night I'm putting, I lose my like little loose cannon. She, I'm putting her to bed. She goes, can I talk to you for a second? Go. She's like eight, eight this weekend. Eight year old goes, can I talk to you for a second? It's such a weird moment. I go, yeah, she was getting bad. So I get in bed next to her and she like posts up on her elbow and she goes, right. Do you believe in time travel? Whoa. And I'm like, it's fucking real. She came back from the future and talk to herself and now she's got to clear it with me.

Speaker 3:          00:36:23       That's where my brain's at. I'm like, this is a great beginning to a great movie. And so, so I was like, I do. And she goes, do you think I could come back to this time right now? And I was like, what do you mean? She's like, if I go into the future and make a time travel machine, could I come back to here? I go, yeah. She goes, what? I'd be this age. I go, no, you'd be older. She goes, oh, okay. That's it. And I was like, what the fuck? I wanted to get more into her head, but you don't want to like start picking it apart. So I go, go to bed and I'm going ahead. I'm like, I'm going out to the fucking man cave. I'm pouring a cocktail and I'm fucking, I was like, that's because I'm obsessed with time travel.

Speaker 3:          00:36:57       So that gives you an excuse to pour a cocktail, start screaming. You need start dreaming, man. A cocktail is what you need to start dreaming. I start when I, when I have a cocktail, that first drink, it's like you're, it's like a, it's like, it gets, it's gets the juices going. You're like this. Is that Ernest Hemingway moment, the Ernest Hemingway? You, do you really believe in time travel? I do. In what way? Uh, I believe that I believe in a couple of things. I believe that there are parallel universes and all over the planet and that you can jump back and forth from those parallel universes based on, um, like I read this thing and I, and I'm doing a poor example of explaining it, but I believe there are universities that I have died in, but this is the one that I'm living in right now. And I think there will be times right, die in this inner universe, but I'll hop over other ones. Does that make sense? Should we just light a joint right now? Yeah, I think you might have to.

Speaker 1:          00:37:47       I think this like what, where is this coming from? Like is one thing to have like a theory like that could be possible and it certainly could be. I mean just the universe itself, it's so bizarre. Yeah. There are hundreds of billions of planets in this galaxy. This is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe that this universe might be a part of an infinite number of universes because each black hole has one half of 1% of the mass of the galaxy. It's a supermassive black hole, and they believe that inside that black hole is another universe.

Speaker 3:          00:38:15       That's where your time traveling in those black holes could, I just saw something online about it, but I'm obsessed. I'd like if you've seen time traveler's wife. No. If I tell you about it, I'll start crying. It's the greatest movie ever. Does it like old yeller? Because I cry when I see, oh yeller, it's better. It's better as a comic is best. I talked to Duncan about it one time and he cried, but Dunkin but Dunkin, so Dunkin, like you can't bring half a subject to Dunkin because he knows the rest of it. He'll fill it up with Satan and he, I go, it's the greatest movie in all rape. He goes, you saw, you know Dunkin? Yeah. Fallah movie. I go, yeah. He goes, does he suck his own Dick?

Speaker 3:          00:38:52       Oh. And he goes, then it's different than the book. You read the book? He goes, yeah. He goes back in time and teaches himself to jack off. He does. It's like, are you serious? And don't get it. Like, yeah. So he goes back in time and talks to himself about jerking off. Teaches himself how to it. I haven't read the book or You saw the movie? I don't know. We've got a cold Tonkin. Oh God. So he goes back in time and sucks is on deck. I Guess Duncan's one that gave me this information that's not unnecessary. I mean, Jesus Christ, all the shit you can do if you had a time machine, I'm going come back at Tom. Suck my own dick. What really? How about yeah, how about see a dinosaur? That's what everybody would do. Right. Um, when you say

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       like that you believe in time travel, do you think that time travel is happening right now? Do you believe that there is, it's possible that someone could come here right now and they could be from the future?

Speaker 3:          00:39:47       I hope so. I hope so. I believe that when you die, you time travel for everyone else. Like I think you keep living. I don't believe in death. I believe you keep living. Why do you think that? Because I don't want to die. I'm so obsessed with not dying, but why do you see,

Speaker 1:          00:40:03       my thought is always that this life that we've looked at from the moment we were born, the breathing in and breathing out the water in the ocean, the trees that we've just come to accept this as the only reality and that it's very possible that whatever happens when you die is just a spectacular but completely different in some in an unimaginable way. And I get this from psychedelic experiences that I've had that seems so real, but they're so different from anything that you see in this life that it made me reconsider this idea of what? What is like the material life that we live? What does this material world and is this material world the only possibility for an existence? And I don't think it is. I think this is just one possibility out of an infinite number of potential possibilities of how life could be.

Speaker 1:          00:40:55       I think this is just the life that we're in right now. This is what life is, but the idea of living this kind of life over and over again, um, I wouldn't say it's not appealing because I love life. I have, I'm having a great time. I really enjoy it. Some people get annoyed at you when you say that because they haven't figured life out or they don't. I'm not, not that I'm some sort of a master in life that I've figured it out. I'm better than you. But what I'm saying is I figured out a way to live a life that is very enjoyable for me. I enjoy it and I enjoy it because of a lot of things. I enjoy it because I have great friends. I enjoy it because I love what I do for a living. I enjoy it because I love my family.

Speaker 1:          00:41:31       I enjoy it because I, I just, I just, I have a passion for learning things and I have a passion for just experiencing things. There's so much to live and experience in this life. I'm enjoying the fuck out of it. And the idea of this, like one of the most terrifying things for people is the idea of reincarnation and not just the idea of death, but the idea that you live the same life over and over again. Well, I take it, I have this again, I like this slide. This life is great. I wouldn't like age one through 15 was rough, really from 15 on things started getting a lot better, but still it's still, it's still like anxiety filled, fucking crazy disaster. Well, I mean I probably was deep into my thirties before I realized how to calm down and actually enjoy life and not just be like running on ice, like hoping I don't fall, you know, just wow, like barely been control, but moving some album. That's how I always felt. And now I feel like I'm on solid ground and I'm moving forward. It's still completely unpredictable and it's still, you know, largely out of your control, but the things that you can control, you kind of understand those things. But for a lot of people, the idea of living this whole life over and over and over again, it's terrifying that it's pointless.

Speaker 3:          00:42:50       Oh, I told my dad the other day, I have, I went through some drama back home with friends where a friend passed and it was really fucking hard. And my dad was talking about death a lot and I was, I got real surreal and I was like, you know, I don't think, I mean like, I think people would be sad at my funeral by guarantee you a lot of people would be like, he did a lot more than we expected with the minimum amount of tools that God gave him. He really milked the fuck out of whatever bullshit he had. That's funny. That's funny. Cause I want people to be sad, but I want people to also go. I get, you know who said it? I just heard it, so, oh God damn it. It was fucking Hixon Gracie. I was listening to the podcast today.

Speaker 3:          00:43:31       Yeah, I'm about to quote Hicks. He was here fuck. Sitting in the seat an hour ago and he said, you feel like you're absorbing his energy from that seat. Dude, I saw the documentary choke. He's a bad motherfucker. Bad Ass fucking documentary hits. Um, I in the, and what really got me into Hickson was cron cause I listened to the podcast with Chron and he seemed very grounded. He seemed very real going back to the valley Tudo and he was like, I'm going to do it. And you just like, and I didn't even know what that was at the time I was there. That's a really fascinating family. I'd like to see a movie made about their grandfather.

Speaker 1:          00:44:02       Oh yeah. Yeah. This Guy Leo on my tee shirt,

Speaker 3:          00:44:05       he's, you know, his, his story stories. Like he jumped in an ocean and rescue people from sharks. I hung out. Why? I told you about, you know, I hung out with Horian that day and Horian talked to about his grandpa, his father, a bunch like he challenged, he got sent to jail and them came out of the steps in Rio de Janeiro out of the courthouse and challenge the guide the guy's brother to a fight at the court steps like this is like 1930 this is just fucking, Rio de Janeiro

Speaker 1:          00:44:32       was insane and I've been to Rio. So now you have like the real scope of it and you meet Brazilians and all his stories are so much better because the way he says them with able to a zillion accident and I put you in the grave, I put you in the ditch. That's how it goes. If you don't like it, cause these guys don't know. Jews use it too. I mean it's so fucking, it was a great pocket. You know, he had a philosophy on life. Leo did a very specific philosophy. He believed that you live this life and if you do anything wrong, if you do anything the wrong way, you live the life over again. You have to come back and do it again. That was his thought. He did. He said that Albert Brooks Movie Groundhog Day. No, no though heaven where Brooks goes to heaven and every time they show him all his mistakes in life.

Speaker 1:          00:45:14       Do you ever saw that? No, I don't think you did. Yeah, that's not fucking whatever. Don't put up. Um, don't pull it up. Don't pull it up. It's all fucking bullshit. Don't fucking pull it up. Jamie. Jesus Christ. Jamie. Um, but the, the idea behind that is scary to a lot of people. You know that you, you have to like, when life presents you a scenario, you have to pick the correct answer. You have to do the correct thing, have the correct behavior. That was his thought. I this one of the, one of the first times I ever actively considered that possibility was reading an interview with him where he was talking about lists and he, the way he says it, he was an older man and he was saying it in Portuguese and they were translating it in English, but he was saying that, you know you, this is like, he wasn't saying it like I think maybe it could be possibly now.

Speaker 1:          00:46:01       He was just stating it as a fact that you will live this life over and over again until you get it right. What a tough place to grow up in Brazil. He was just this unbelievable stud. I'm just an incredible bad motherfucker and not like a physically imposing man. He was 130 540 pounds, small guy, like maybe one 47 like at his heaviest. He wasn't big by any stretch of the imagination. It wasn't physically strong, wasn't some kind of freak athlete, wasn't particularly flexible, just smart as fuck. Toughest Shit. Just figured out how to, first of all, never had sex unless it was for procreation. Came in, every girl he ever had sex with, he had like 19 kids and I'm not bullshitting. He had a ton of kids and all of them killers. He, me, he raised the greatest fighters the martial arts world has ever known.

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       If you want to talk about a family, there's never been a family that can fuck with the grace. He's, it's not even a close second. It's like, what's the greatest martial arts family of all time? The Gracies, everybody would say that. And it's directly, the shamrock has tried to do that. Right? Well, they tried to name all the kids they adopted shamrock. Yeah. But that's, you know, that's, that's the take on it. First of all, it's that Bob Shamrock was a, just a great guy who took in a lot of kids that had troubled pasts and he would take a lot of them in when they were in their 19, 18, 20, you know, and adopt them. You know, we take them as they were older, they were already troubled

Speaker 4:          00:47:29       kids like frank shamrock, um, went into great depth about it. Like, you know who he's really troubled and had all sorts of legal problems and everything. When, when Bob took him in and he changed his name to shamrock and then, uh, Ken Shamrock, of course, same thing, you know, so Bob Shamrock, the guy who did that was just a, a really great guy who taught those young men how to be a man. You know, that's important. Oh, without a doubt. Hugely a fort, but very different than what Leo did. Leo just made an army with his dick. He like created an army, like all these people that were born out of his, his procreation, they became these killers. He's killer fighters. And he was basically starting a franchise. His Dna, he started at Jujitsu franchise like Robert Hartman did with the Improv. In a way that's almost impossible to replicate today unless you, they fucking sociopath.

Speaker 4:          00:48:22       I mean, you could kind of only do this and in 1940 just shoot loads and checks. And he was the Johnny Appleseed of Fugitsu by just sweet. Now does hoists and Horian and Hickson had the same moms? That's a good question. Some of them do not. Have the same moms. I do not believe that hoists and Hicks and have the same mom. I think they have different moms. There's a bunch of moms in the picture and he, I would love to grab a book, just married, not married. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm fucking, I'm fucking, I'm making babies. And his, his thing is like, you know, he would talk about it every time I would have sex is for procreation. Like he, he wasn't having recreational sex. He was trying to make babies different story maybe. But he was such a gangster man.

Speaker 4:          00:49:09       He was so interesting. I had a Steve Maxwell on the podcast before and Steve Maxwell when he was, uh, before he was even a Blackbaud, I believe he's a brown belt. He was a training with hoists and he went to stay, stayed for a couple months at Elios farm in Brazil. And Leo would, uh, you know, he had cows and goats and he would milk the goats and they would make cheese with the, with the goat milk. It was all raw, unpasteurized cheese. He would grow his own vegetables. He had like a way of living that was like really like close to nature. Like he didn't believe in preservatives. He didn't believe in antibiotics for animals and like everything that he ate was like stuff that he grew and did everything like in a very natural way. Fascinating. It makes you feel like a bitch and you hear about a guy like that. He's just the guy just, I mean I'm still jacking off. Think about all the Times you've pulled out your life. How about him? Never just fucking roaring into the abyss with his calm far more babies. Bring them to me. I will raise them and turn them into an army. I, I'm impressed by the challenging people like the Hixson does. Like they challenged people to a fight and they go, I challenge you to, if I haven't challenged anybody to shit, well that's probably good. In this day and age it doesn't really work. It's like,

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       you know, challenge someone to erase and all that's invented as bicycles, right? Today they have a thing called cars are going to lose it. Fucking race. Volume was a bike. I'm going to race you and the guy blows by you on a car. Like you challenge people to fights and they're gonna fucking stab you. Someone's going to shoot you. It's not, it's a different world that we live in. I mean it was a different world in Hickson's time. You heard the stories that he was telling about people showing up to fights with guns and knives and shit. But I think what Leo was doing, W it was such a wild time like living in Brazil at that time, completely different era, you know, completely different time as far as martial arts too. It was almost unknown. Like the, the, the, the reality of martial arts at that time was essentially Asian.

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       It was all Asian influenced. It was Japanese, it was karate and it was Kung Fu. And then there was, uh, India had some wrestling and then there's Iran had wrestling. There was some, uh, different cultures that had grappling arts. But essentially all of it was coming from Asia. There was nothing in South America, there was nothing in a, in North America, there was boxing, you know, people had to hand techniques. And some wrestling, but the, what they had started and what his family had started was a revolution changed martial arts from that seed, the seed that was planted by my Ada, by this, uh, this guy that had come to, um, to Japan to teach, he came from, uh, from Japan to Brazil to teach he, he planted seeds and these Brazilian people that spread across the entire world within a hundred years, I mean less than 100 years later, martial arts have evolved more substantially than they have in the last thousand. It's really the last 20 years from the time Americans found out about it from 93 on from 93 on is that when Jujitsu showed up, that's when Jujitsu showed up in the form of the ultimate fighting championship. That's when we saw funny hoists, Gracie, because we were taking a long time for it to take root.

Speaker 3:          00:52:20       Mike Larosa was like group one of my friends who is from Saudi Arabia like you, but he grew up in Saudi Arabia, but it's that I think worked for coke or something or you know, he had a job over there and he came back to the states and he was in eighth grade and I met him in like seventh grade, eighth grade. And he would learn Jujitsu in Saudi Arabia. Whoa. And he was talking about Jujitsu and I remember that's the first time I ever heard about it. So not your Rabia. Wow. Yeah. I wish I can get in touch with him. Callen grew up overseas like that. You know, my cousin hung out with you the other night. My fucking cousin. Because your cousin, big tall kid. Like with like a ginger hair. You, you hung out with you and cal. He's friends with Callan. Andrew Hobson. Where was this at the Improv, like you guys were all hanging out and my cousin's like, go.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       I met Joe and I said, Oh really? Did you tell him you're my cousin? And he's like, ah, like a lot of thought when you do that. He's like, I don't know. I said, well, what did you say goes well, I like you. After he left, it was Kim and Callan and he said, yeah, I think my cousin is friends with Joe. And Callen goes, who's your cousin? He goes, Burke, Chrysler Gallegos. Your guns is burned. You haven't even brought that up. Yeah, that's a weird thing. Not Blowing up at a comedy club. He's been hanging out with Kalyn like weeks. He's never mentioned that he's my cousin because fucking socially retarded. How did he hang out? Why is he hanging out with Callan? What's going on? I have no idea. He's like a screen. He's a writer and he's trying to put something together for Kalyn and so a, and so they, I don't know, you know Khalil is like a good guy.

Speaker 3:          00:53:38       So he's like, Hey, come hang out with a beer. We'll watch the fight or whatever. And that counts. Like come down, we're doing comedy juice and then you and him are all hanging out. I go, Andy, Andrew, you're in a moment. We could just simply make things very casual and say, hey my cousin's Bert Kreischer and you would've just been like, oh how cool. And that's it. He would have never leveraged it by go fucking bring it up. He goes, oh and then maybe next time maybe he's like I'm tired of being bird crushed. His cousins want to be much so would it be me man, this is fucking bullshit. Part living limiting your fucking shadow. It's just interesting the way people carry themselves. Cause I'm the first person like that if like, like if I ran into Eddie probably on the street, I was, first of all I was like I it's Bert Cause I never think anyone remembers my name by be like it has Bert.

Speaker 3:          00:54:21       I'm friends with Joe. Like I would connect the tissue right away. Yeah, that's probably the best way. But then if you've done that, never have someone do that and then you bring it up to the person and they go, I don't know that fucking dude. That's weird. When someone like becomes really friendly with you under false pretenses that it finds you find out they don't really know that person. Yeah. That's awkward. Really. All I was afraid that I was afraid when I was met Hixon that saying that I had, I had roll, I'd world round with his brother. I didn't know if they were friends or not. They have issues. I was fucking nervous saying that I'm an idiot. No, it's not an, you're not an idiot at all. No big deal. I mean, just because they have issues doesn't mean you have to have issues with them, but why can't I just be confident enough to go, hi, my name's Bert.

Speaker 3:          00:55:03       It's very nice to meet you because you wanted to tell a story and you know, be, you know, I've had some experiences with Jujitsu. Yeah. As an untrained God, that was unhurt Burt, right? Yeah. That was the craziest fucking shall, I couldn't believe what you did on that show. I'm glad you didn't get totally hurt. I got what God did. I broke my ribs and broke my foot. Yeah, but you're alive. Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad I'm alive. Totally hurt is dead cause there's a lot of fucking shows where you could easily get totally hurt. Yeah, I could, I, I could have really gotten fucked up, but thank God I didn't. I W I w I mean I I the thing I was telling some about it the other day, the thing that was crazy about doing that show was that like we technically shot a porn one day.

Speaker 3:          00:55:41       Really? Oh yeah. Like no questions asked. They sent me to a Dominatrix camp and they sent me to a dominatrix and then I was the gimp. So like I was tortured for like, not even like, not even like 30 minutes for like five hours. Dude, they bring me in for folks only listening. He just said, dude. And then he scooted his chair back, put his hands on the rest and adjusted himself. Here we go. I they show the whole premise was, I didn't know what I was going to do, but I was walking a mile in another man's shoes. So I show up to, this place is on, it's like downtown by the Ralphs downtown. If you take six all the way down, it's like I'm in a mansion down there. Right. But right in that area, a downtown mansion, it was a huge fucking house.

Speaker 3:          00:56:23       I didn't even know they had mansions downtown, old school. That's where la started. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. If you, La is an interesting town because it downtown was where everything started. So the further out you go is the expanse of the expanse of La. And then they'd make a leap to the beach. So the connective tissue from the beach to downtown and hey, Brian, shut the door. Did. And so, um, so anyway, so they, they take me to this mansion, I'm in the van and then this dude comes out, turn that switch, turn that light on. This dude comes out with a blindfold and he's like, put this on. So I put it on and then two girls grabbed me by both arms and like walk me through a mansion and I'm walking through this like downstairs, upstairs up these stairs. And then I can feel the lights up, a room on, like I can feel the energy change.

Speaker 3:          00:57:10       So I go and I sit in a, in a, in a gynecological exam table but it's steel and as I sit they start taking my pants off. They take my shirt off. I'm like, I don't want to her. And they're like, don't worry, you won't need it. Totally naked. Totally naked worry. You won't need it. Totally naked. Me Up my arms first, then my legs. Then they take the blindfold off and is this chick mistress Isabella and she is in straight up latex outfit with her tits billing out a zipper on her vagina and she has a cattle prod. She's like, today you're going to be a gap and just prods me in the balls and I'm like, God. I'm like, ah. And the cal probably electrical like electrical prod, like not like not, not in a cat. I'm, I'm using large terms to express the the event but like not like a like that now but like electric shock, like boutique and shocks.

Speaker 3:          00:57:58       My balls like blank and I'm like, and we are producers allowed all this to take place. My producers were sitting on apple boxes in front of me. They're all sitting on our boxes with camera men that are sitting on tripods. They've got lights all over around Marnie Hochman, the executive at the time for Fox is sitting there too, and for like three hours and they put five pound weights on my balls. They fucking pounds, nipple clamps with weights on the nipple clamps, candle wax. And it won't, what? Go ahead. Pop five pounds. They work up to that. They can put a one pounder and then, uh, they put, they put this thing around your balls that looks like a bracelet. It's, it looked just like this. They put her on your balls like this. And then the, and it's got two sides, like Hasidic Jewish is ringlets that are chains.

Speaker 3:          00:58:43       And then they put a weight on it just holds them down. It didn't actually hurt that bad, but uh, then the lady said, all right, are you ready? Would you rather the speculum? And I was like, next. She's like, or the sounds. And I was like, oh, the sound's so she brings meaning open your asshole. I'm sorry. Any speculation, I'm guessing. Yeah. So she puts, opens the this leather briefcase and there's different like steel rods that are look like look like this thin, they're like this and the summer, different shaped and I was like, I want the sounds, I don't even know what that has been. It looks like harmonic tuning forks that you'd hit and go boom and then put by my balls and I'd be like, and she goes, all right, he wants to sounds lube them up. I go lube them up. Where do you, where do you put them?

Speaker 3:          00:59:24       She goes, we, we put them in your urethra. And I was like, oh I go, why the fuck do you call them the sounds then and not dick sticks or something else. She goes cause each one makes you make a different sound. I was, oh that's not sounds and I was done. It's not sounds, if you have to make them yourself, that's like going to a hamburger place. They go, all right. Did you bring your own beef? Like what was the hamburger place? The fuck, you don't sell hamburgers, the sounds you make your own sounds.

Speaker 3:          00:59:57       She's going to play me like an instrument. So you did this for how long? I, probably four hours and then we went downstairs. She was actually pretty cool and she was pretty hot. Hot, like pretty hot six. Uh, I'm gonna say I'm gonna say hard seven low eight. [inaudible] seven [inaudible] seven like, like she like a definite set. It's hard to judge because she was in lay tech, so anyone in latex automatically it's like a six. But, but she had a really pretty face, but she had like the, you know, the kind of face where you're like, I'm attracted to it, but it's not like my ideal. Okay. Like the kind of chick that if she's a librarian you'd fuck her. But if she worked as a Hooters waitress and you're like, Eh, you know what I mean? Google or Google or Mr Bella. No, no, no.

Speaker 3:          01:00:37       But you can see what she looks like. She's, I don't want to give her any press. He's out there needle and people and putting fucking sounds and their dick. Yeah. She was like, this one dude came out and like, uh, it looked like he got done in the gym. Okay. He had like a bag on and he was like, look like you get cleaned up and he just gotten out of the gym. I think that's the only way I can express it. Became out of this door from ups downstairs. I go, who is he? She goes, oh, well I'll see you later. And he's like, bye. Thank you. She's like, he's been down there for the weekend. I was like, what? And she's like, yeah, some people pay to stay down there. And I tortured them throughout the weekend. Oh God. And I was like, really? And then the whole, all right, pull a picture of this bitch up I need, his mistress is a Bella and I say bitch with all love and respect, she's, I'm sure she'd want the press of people buying or videos.

Speaker 3:          01:01:18       What if she's still doing it? I'll never forget that name though. Mr and she had hurt her assistant was this Asian chick who was hot as fuck. This is the best part of the whole thing is at the very beginning, they look at my dick and it's so small and she looks, yells back to the Asian shake. She goes, we're working with a blood cock. I go, what? She goes, we're working with a blood cock. I go, you're talking to me? She goes, yeah, you're, you have a blood cock. What does that mean? I go, exactly. I'm like, what? What? As opposed to, and I'm like, is there, do I have a venereal disease? Like something going on? She goes, no, no, no. There's Meat Cox and there's blood Cox. You have a blood cock. It means that when blood shows up to your cock, it then looks good, but until that blood's there, it doesn't look any good.

Speaker 3:          01:01:56       When you have a meat cock, you have a lot of meat on your cock and then very little room for blood. So guys that have big Dick soft or meet Cox, she's hot. It's fucked dude. Yup. That's her. That looks like her. Yeah. That really looks like her mistress Isabella. Is She in la? Yeah. She's beautiful. Yeah. She's, she's not a seven. My balls were getting tortured. I don't fucking remember perfectly. Maybe this is just like a really good picture of it. But that, yeah, that does look like her cause she has like a, yeah, she's pretty hot.

Speaker 1:          01:02:22       That's pretty hot. I wouldn't say that. I'd say that. It's like at least that picture, the picture that I'm looking at going back to the other, she gave me a bunch of videos. I have videos of what it was back when you go to that. I mean I have a blank screen

Speaker 3:          01:02:33       VCR. She gave me a bunch of VCRs of like dominatrix stuff, man. Some of the shit was so hot. VCR tapes of dominatrix stuff. Yeah. This is before you could like get online and have quick Internet to watch whatever the fuck you want. So like do you mean you've always had fast internet but like, but like there was a very big period of time up until like, I want to say like 2004 that like downloading porn just took forever. Unless you had like Dsl and this was before then. This is probably 2001 and so 2002 and so she gave me a bunch of BCR. She's like, cause she did one thing that really turned me on and I was like, Whoa, what the fuck was that? And then, and then I regressed in the middle of all this torturing and I remember the first thing I ever saw sexually was that a new stand and it was dom, it was a girl's tied up when I was like first grade. So first thing I ever saw and I went, whew, she was, we'll check these videos out, see if you like them. And like I wish I still had one of the videos.

Speaker 1:          01:03:29       So she did something to you while you were in the middle of being tortured. He did like, well you just fucking hit it. Whatever it is.

Speaker 3:          01:03:37       I said, marshmallow, safe word marshmallow. Give me the fuck Outta here. I don't want to blow a load in front of everybody. Wow. Is that good? Yeah, it was with latex and she had me bound like, like you were sending a package to somebody and she was and I was like, and I get,

Speaker 1:          01:03:51       see what I want. If I was going to talk to a woman like that, I would want to know what she does in her personal life. Like this is like your job, like you like super normal, you know like

Speaker 5:          01:04:02       they're usually submissive when their mistress in their personal life. Yeah. At least all the people that I know a lot of those guys because at my ex girlfriend and all of them like spank beat. I know this one girl that would go up to San Francisco and get her ass kicked by, a guy would pay her money just to get her ass kicked and just come back like thousands of dollars. But usually in real life stop or pay her money to get her asking. What do you mean there's the whole community's really fucked up. Like there's, there's mistresses and the are, there's guys that do it all. So the guys are creepy. Guys are creepy as you saying. No, the guy would beat her up. The guy would pretty much beat her up, like what would, what we would think is beating up. But to her it was called a fetish. It would be like spanking, beating. You would have electrical prods that you would like electrocute the person. She would come back black and blue every time he would pay her. Yeah. And then she got off

Speaker 1:          01:04:51       show up and he got off on beating her. Yes. Oh, I wouldn't trust to do that. I would think that that guy is going to take it too far. Yeah. Get his credit card number first. That's not enough.

Speaker 5:          01:05:01       Your Dad, you going to fucking use it on amazon.com fuck you. I'm a ghost. I'm ordering Shit Online. Nature box.

Speaker 1:          01:05:11       I don't know why, but for me it's one thing like if a dude likes to get tied up and beat up by a check, that's as disturbing as

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       a guy who wants to beat a checkup. The Dai, the guy, a guy wanting to bt checkup is fucking, that's dangerous to me. That's scary. Don't chew in front of a microphone burden. It's just weird. I can't help it, man. You got me on these fucking, just push the microphone aside or don't eat while the podcast is on. It's only a couple hours, buddy. You can get through it. I know you can do it. You're strong. You're strong. Bert. Kreischer yeah, I don't know. I don't deal. There's some really bums me out about a guy that wants a beat up a check. Yeah. Well this is, I mean Panger well yeah, at least he's going about it the right way. Is it? I mean really. I mean, I don't know man. It makes me think of like, what was it? Was it seven? Was it the movie? Psycho American psycho.

Speaker 4:          01:05:56       That's what it was. Yeah. American psycho where he would do fucked up shit to them and then pay them and then he ran into the girl on the street and she's like, no, get away. He's like it. He's going to, I would love for you. I would love for you to get a high end prostituting here like the girl, but just to hear her stories of like, I guarantee you she's got some fucked up stories. This is not about that though. When you get a high end prostitute, you don't hear stories, just fuck them. Jesus Christ, we, me and my buddy Eddie saw this, I mean the hottest chick I've ever seen in my life in Vegas where we're just walking around and this girl comes up, she's like, if you guys want to party. And I remember thinking, not knowing she was a prostitute, the hottest girl I've ever seen in my life.

Speaker 4:          01:06:35       And I was like 10 10 no questions asked, 10 after a car accident, 10 in a softball uniform. And I was like, well, I was like, fuck yeah. And she was like 1500 bucks an hour, like 1500 like I remember going, how good is that? It's gotta be amazing for stupid rich billionaire dude who 15 I mean if you have $1 billion, what's 1500 bucks? It's like 50 bucks to you. Probably not even five bucks. Five bucks to you. What do you think the market price, the fair market portrayed pipes for Pocius what do you want to know? I think that if you're getting like a streetwalker, you got one thing and then I can get up to like several thousand dollars. There was a woman who used to, uh, there was a website and it got brought up on my message board and bunch of dudes got so mean with her.

Speaker 4:          01:07:22       It's just, I felt real bad because, uh, they were, they were like going back and forth with her and I think she even signed up on my message board, but it was some insane amount of money was like $6,000 an hour or something like that. Maybe $6,000 a day or $3,000 an hour or you could do the whole evening for six grand or something like that. But it's a lot of money. And um, a lot of them have websites and they, you know, they will like talk about themselves and these very flattering and glowing terms and talk about their interest and all that. And you're like, yeah, but you're a prostitute. Like if, if all these things were awesome about you, why would you be a prostitute? That's the weird thing about prostitutes. Like this guy had a real interesting point. I was watching this ted video the other day, we were just talking about prostitutes. Yeah, I was talking about prostitutes and he was always talking about pornography and like what's negative about pornography? And one of the things was talking about was like

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       this social exile aspect of it that like say if you, okay, like here's the perfect example. I would invite you over to my house anytime you want to come over and have dinner and you've been over my house before for my kids' parties and shit. You're a good friend. But if you told me that you had been to a prostitute, um, it wouldn't affect me at all. Like I wouldn't, I wouldn't go, oh, fucking birds never coming over my house again. That's sick. Fuck. Of course a w over. But if you had been a prostitute, I would never have you over. And the well he was saying is we will sit down with people that have been to brothels and we have no reservations. Like people who have been to brothels several times. We'll laugh it off. But you don't sit down with prostitutes when you, when a person actually pays for sex, that's one thing.

Speaker 1:          01:09:02       But when a person gets paid for sex, especially a woman, like we put them in this like very undesirable social outcast category. Yeah. So I mean, you know, Molly crab apple, she's a artist who was on the podcast. One's very talented art. It's a very interesting thinker too. She's very, very smart woman. And um, uh, she, she has friends that are a sex workers, you know, and she's, she doesn't see anything wrong with it. You know, her attitude is what's the big deal? It's just sex, you know, that's what they do and they have a good time and they liked their clients and you know, she has friends who do it and you could see it that way. I could, I mean, she obviously did and she's very intelligent. But I think for most of us, that's not how we see it. We put people in a category and that's like a forbidden thing to do. Right? I mean, when you agree,

Speaker 5:          01:09:50       there's definitely different kinds of prostitutes. Like I back in the day before I even knew one, I would, I would think that also, but nowadays with these porn, uh, prostitutes, like there's a website that don't, I won't say, but it's all the high end prostitutes that are in porn and you can sit there and and pick which one you want and then you have to send, you have to go to the doctor, you have to get tested. You have to send your reports to them. You have to give your driver's license, your credit card you have there, they would do it. They're going to do a full background check. Once all this happens, then you get like approved. But every time you want a new prostitute, if it's after 30 days, just like a porn star, you have to get retested again, send them, send the information.

Speaker 5:          01:10:27       But these are high end people. These are presidents of companies. These girls are like anywhere from two to $6,000 but it that come to me, it's like, okay, this is just like porn. You're just doing porn now. This is the person's been tested, background check, blah blah, blah. You're doing it maybe once a month to get an extra $6,000. I can see that a little bit more than like somebody that's like, Hey, I have a room at the motel six, I'm going to be here all day in and out. That to me that's disgusting. That's like a, that's like a horrible, that's like what I think a prostitute is.

Speaker 1:          01:10:54       Well a lot of them was just like when they're that it's just drug addicts that are making poor decisions because they have to take chances because they need to get their fix. Well you're talking about is like a slick escort situation, which yeah, for the girl probably definitely better. And for the guy probably better too.

Speaker 5:          01:11:11       And it's way better than porn if you think it. Cause I mean like these people are presidents of companies, they've been tested and everything. No one knows about it. We're like pig a pig. Oh about it. They have a database, you know about credit cards and they told you, right, well why? What meaning like a doctor, they get tested for STDs. Right. But what I'm saying is it's not advertised for the whole road to be like, oh look at this person's butthole and pussy and they're getting fucked by this guy. You know, it's like you don't get to see it. So I see what you're saying. It's a little different. It's weird. Well look, my, my stance on it of course

Speaker 1:          01:11:44       is it, everything should be illegal. I mean I think if you want to get your balls, cattle prodded and you know, you want to get beat up by some dominatrix, of course it should be illegal. Obviously. I, I have more of a problem, like I said with a woman getting beat up. I just, my, my core, my DNA, here's that. I just go like that. That, I don't know, cause I feel like a guy that would want to beat the shit out of a woman. Like I don't like it.

Speaker 5:          01:12:09       There's something deep seated. There's something dirty inside that not just dirty

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       like I, I think they're dangerous. Like a woman is physically weaker than a man. Like did the display, like it makes more sense to me that a man would want to get beat up by a woman because it's, it's not, you have to give into her to do that. Like you could just, she could hit you too hard and you'd be like, bitch, what the fuck did you just, you know, like it would change the whole thing. But these guys, a lot of them that are these dominatrix, um, clients, they're um, they're like really powerful people who are in these positions where they run companies and they have all these people that listened to them and they have to be buttoned down all day and they were in ties and shit and never speak. And they'd get there. Yes, mistress. Yes, mistress and the you kiss my foot, you piece of shit. Yeah. This mistress, like they like that. It's like a free release to them and the chick beats him up and kicks him in the balls and shit. Like it doesn't bother me. I mean, maybe it's hypocritical. Maybe I'm now minded in my thinking, but I fuck, I got a real problem with a guy wants to beat the shit out of check.

Speaker 5:          01:13:13       I think you, I think a lot of us do. It's really fucked up too. But the guy that I'm talking about, the supposedly, I mean I know a couple of people that used to do this and, and the, it would be like dentist's chair in a room like dark, like Dexter. They get tied up and then just like different things. You pull out his like little tools and the whole time just like fucking sitting there with a hard on with her. No one that's a bunch of bad life decision. How many of those girls one up getting killed and they must happen. It must. It must. I mean how many girls

Speaker 1:          01:13:43       killed every year by Johns? I mean it must happen. Do you remember that guy in Vancouver? Not Vancouver. Was a outside of Vancouver somewhere. BC who is a serial killer who killing prostitutes and feeding them. Knew his pigs.

Speaker 5:          01:13:56       I heard pigs leave fucking anything. Yeah, they'll eat anything. Yeah. There was that movie snatch. Right. What movie is that? Yeah, that's where I learned it. Dammit. Fuck can say something like, I learned it and then I'm like, Oh, you learned that all the real world.

Speaker 3:          01:14:14       You fucking say some real deep philosophical shit and turns out puck said it first. I can't believe we're sober. Hey man, we can be funny sober and have fun sober that. Yeah, I've uh, I don't know what I was saying, but yeah, I'm fucking an idiot. Pigs, pigs and prostitutes. Pigs. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:38       Yeah. Pigs are fucking voracious eaters, man. They're ruthless. They, uh, they would just run through bodies. They, you know, you throw a body in there. If anything, you know, any kind of an animal, they just eat, they'll eat everything. They'll eat everything. The only thing you're supposed to do, if you try to get rid of a body and you throw it in a pig pen, is he supposed to smash the teeth? Cause they'll, they won't, uh, they won't eat the teeth. Totally. Really let him down. Yeah. The teeth will come out whole and then you have dental records and shit like that mother fucker you need, he's like a hardcore coffee grinder and you throw the tea.

Speaker 3:          01:15:09       Oh, make it shut up. I'm Vitamix. Oh yeah. Tech. You ever seen a BLENDTEC blender? Fucking iPhone. You should try teeth next time. So I knew what I wanted to talk to you about. Bulletproof coffee. Okay. So I'm sitting with my dad in Tampa. He's like, buddy, I'm going to give you the best coffee I've ever had. I was like, what? And he's like me and Bartol level of him. It's his best friend I go to. He goes, bulletproof coffee, you're going to fucking love it. But he's not doing, he's not getting bulletproof coffee. He's just using organic coffee. That's fine. And then doing the mix. Well, you know, that's fine, right? Yeah. But I feel bad cause there's a bullet proof of his steed. ASPREY, Dave Asprey.

Speaker 1:          01:15:45       Don't feel bad because, let me explain to you all the fallout. I don't know if you've paid attention to what happened. No. Um, okay. The original idea of mixing up and bulletproof executive is Dave Asprey's company and he has bulletproof this and bulletproof that and it's like sort of a marketing labeling thing. Yeah. So he called it bulletproof coffee. It was actually invented by a guy named Rob Wolf and Robb Wolf came up with it a long time ago and wrote about it, about mixing MCT oil and butter in coffee.

Speaker 3:          01:16:11       Now real quick, MCT oil is medium

Speaker 1:          01:16:14       chain triglyceride oil and what it is is they take the most nutritious aspects of coconut oil and some different kinds of oil. They spin them in a centrifuge and they take out this, I'm just using coconut oil. Coconut oil is fine. Okay. Coconut oil is a very good for virgin or reverse margin. Now you don't want to if you want raw raw coconut on. Yeah, it's very good for you. Yeah. Um, anyway, so what Aspery was telling us was that his coffee was uniquely free of Mycotoxins and that mycotoxins where we give people headaches, mycotoxins would cause you to crash. All these, all these different things he was attributing to microtoxins and he was even saying that point being, here's the point, he had no tests. He wasn't showing us anything like, like he was saying that all these different coffees of Mycotoxin, it's a real issue.

Speaker 1:          01:17:02       No one talks about it, but when you start reading about it online, I found out that this wasn't an issue at all. Like it wasn't something that people talking about that were involved in the coffee world. Like there had been mycotoxin issues in the past, but they figured out a bunch of different way, cold or wet processing, a bunch of different ways to deal with coffee. See all coffee. This is, I found this because I had a peer Giuliani on the podcast who is a coffee expert relation to Rudy. Fascinating guy. No, I think that's his name. Make sure that's this right named Peter Giuliani. I want to, I don't want to, or

Speaker 3:          01:17:37       I've been to many conversations with Todd Carmichael's on travel channel. He does. Uh, he does. He's a coffee expert. He does like dangerous grounds is the name of the show.

Speaker 1:          01:17:44       Peter Juliano. That's his name if Tyree. Very good guy. Anyway, so all coffee comes from Ethiopia, all of it. All of it. Every coffee that's ever been made outside of Ethiopia was originally in Ethiopia and then they took it somewhere else and grew coffee there. So whether it's, I thought all coffee came from Colombia. Yeah, me too. I thought it was like South American cause you always hear about Colombian coffee and that fucking Juan manwell. What's his name? One one, you know Juan Valdez? Juan, is that right? Was his fucking donkey. Well No, it's a black guy picking coffee in Ethiopia. It's an Ethiopian, this thousands of different strains in Ethiopia and maybe, I think he said three to five elsewhere. It's crazy. Wow. All coffee comes from Ethiopia. Okay, okay. Maybe it's more than three to five, but it's a s a minuscule percentage. I don't remember the exact numbers.

Speaker 1:          01:18:42       Um, so be calm. Ethiopia is a very dry climate. It's a very, very unique in that respect. When they were taking coffee other places and growing it, they were dealing with moisture. They were dealing with mold that was growing and it took them a while to figure out that this is bad. They still have coffee, rust is still an issue. But what he was saying, what asked me, we were saying with no evidence whatsoever was that there was all these mycotoxin infected coffee everywhere you look like a Starbucks and coffee bean, it was all bad for you. So we wound up doing tests. First Tate did a caveman coffee, tested their coffee and um, Asprey's coffee, their coffee, which is single estate plan from Colombia, turned out to have no mycotoxins in it whatsoever. It was all done co with wet processing for coffee according to Tate, had below threshold levels, which means it's not significant of two different types of mycotoxins.

Speaker 1:          01:19:40       So that meant that his process, whatever his process was, didn't, wasn't completely eliminating it, but it was nothing where you had to consider what it's, it's such a minuscule amount. There's not dangerous to your body. So that gave us a red flag. So we were like, well, what the fuck? So we start looking into it because we had been parodying what he had been saying about Michael [inaudible]. I had been, I should. Yeah. So then we wound up spending a lot of money on these tests. We tested four different types of coffee for a broad spectrum of uh, mycotoxins. None of them had any in it, so he was saying like 75% of all coffee, mycotoxins in it, but his coffee is uniquely, it's not true. It's just, it's just simply not true. So he was benefiting from this and it left me with a real moral dilemma as one of the owners of on it.

Speaker 1:          01:20:25       Um, should we still sell this coffee? Ultimately I decided I still drink it. So there's nothing wrong with the coffee, but if you go into on its website, you won't see any of that bullshit about mycotoxins anymore. What it is is good single source coffee and that's it. Any unique fucking method that he has of eliminating mycotoxins is not only not necessary, it's unique only to him and not to the entire rest of the fucking multibillion dollar coffee world. Like they know how to take care of that shit. It's, it's hooey. That's what it is. So if your dad's using organic coffee, good coffee, I'm sure it's fine. And if it wasn't fine, you would know. And not only that Doctor Rhonda Patrick said that small levels of mycotoxins actually, they elicit a compensatory response from your body that can even be beneficial. Really.

Speaker 5:          01:21:19       I remember when you were saying like I, the thing that made me kind of go, well that doesn't seem right. When I kept on going like, when are you going to test Starbucks? And he's like, oh, it's really expensive. And it's not a thousand bucks across, just like, you know, 4,000 bucks to test. But that would be a good test to have if you had a company like am I spend a $2,000 so I can say Starbucks had it and you don't get anything Starbucks, right. Test. They're fucking coffee. You know? It's just, it's, it's really fucked up. Look, he is said in the past that he had aspergers then he cured it with his bulletproof diet. I suspect he has not cured it.

Speaker 1:          01:21:52       We're dealing with a bit of a social issue here. It's not just, and he got famous from doing this stuff and being on our podcast introduced him to millions, literally millions of people, and I feel real responsible in that way because a lot of people like you were about to pair it, that your dad was doing it all wrong because your dad was getting his coffee. It wasn't Michael Toxin free. Guess what? Oh, coffee essentially is fucking mycotoxins, mycotoxins rail. But there's mycotoxins in everything. There's mycotoxins in human breast milk. There's micro toxins in porn. Hi Britt, you out. Let's not talk about that. We're going again. But there's, it's not the issue that he made it out to be. Not only that, he also said something that I also should've fucking chase down on him. He said, his coffees you need gives you an unique cognitive benefits.

Speaker 1:          01:22:43       There's no mechanism in your coffee that uniquely makes you smarter. It doesn't exist. It's just coffee. You're, it's not, there's nothing special. It's not a genetically modified being from Mars that makes you fucking brain grow when you drink a cup of Java. It's just fucking coffee. Does caffeine have cognitive benefits? Yes, it does. Yes it does. Yes it does. It has been proven. These things are proven. Does caffeine or those coffee have antioxidant effects? Yes, it does. There's nothing bad with it. I mean, there's a lot of good aspects to coffee. It's, it's, it's not bad for you as long as you drink it in moderation. But this idea that, you know, we got fucked, we got hoodwinked. I liked the, I liked the recipe though with, I do a table at the pub up, a tablespoon and a half of coconut oil, a do a teaspoon of that butter, that grass fed butter and a cup of coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:23:34       Dave's a very good collector of ideas. He's an excellent collector of ideas, but he's, he doesn't have any degree in nutritional science and in fact he got things wrong. Completely opposite that Rhonda Patrick was very upset about and she had a correct on the podcast. Really? Yeah. One of the things he got wrong was it, but he's talking about a diet and the effect that famine has on jeans and he got it the total opposite way. There have been, there have been studies that have shown that there's something about the body's compensatory reaction to famine that actually can make the children of people who have gone through famine live longer. He got it the opposite. He was saying that it made the children who had parents that had nutritional deficits that they lived shorter lives. It's just he doesn't understand. He's just parroting things and that's the problem with this whole thing with what he's essentially done with the bulletproof coffee thing was an idea from the Paleo community.

Speaker 1:          01:24:30       Paleo community's all about healthy fats. It's all about Avocados. They're all about like their diet. The term Paleo has kind of been debunked in a sense because the Paleolithic people, you know, they didn't necessarily eat, I don't like the word Paleo for that reason because scientifically it doesn't make sense, but here's why it's good. The natural foods, vegetables, meats, fishes, those things are easy for your body to digest. Your is very, it's normal. You give your body a salad and a good lean piece of chicken and your body has 100%. It knows exactly what to do with that. There's no confusion. You give your body a bowl of pasta and it's like, what the fuck is this genetically modified grain that you've turned into a pasta that you boiled? And then you've got, you've got sauce that's got corn syrup in it, so there's, there's fucking high fructose corn syrup and the sauce and all this.

Speaker 1:          01:25:28       Your body just goes, oh cause he doesn't know what the fuck to do with it. That's the difference between eating Paleo and eating processed foods that are heavy in nitrates and antibiotics and preservatives and all the bullshit that's in the common, you know, modern diet. That is where the Paleo people have it. Right? And that there are benefits to having healthy fats in your diet. It's, it's good for your skin, it's good for your brain, you know, um, all the, the different essential fatty acids that you get from fish and that you get from different, like, like I said, Avocados and there's a lot of benefits to eating healthy natural foods, so is is is the

Speaker 3:          01:26:09       MCT oil and the and the grass fed butter, is that just, is that just good fat for your body or does that get the cause? This is what I say, this people that are asking, but I don't know if this is accurate but it helps the same way as Xanax gets into your fat molecules. It helps getting caffeine into your fat mute molecule so it stays longer. Well, this is the idea

Speaker 1:          01:26:28       behind it. The idea behind it is that you blend the butter and you blend the MCT oil and those healthy fats combined with the coffee and then it gives you more of a slow release aspect of caffeine because your body has to absorb it slower. Now, some people dispute that. Alan Alan Aragon, who I'm going to eventually get on the podcast. Very, very bright guy. Very interesting guy. Says there's no proof that it, it, it burns it slower that way, but for me personally, I find my, at least anecdotal evidence based on personal experience is that when I drink that bulletproof coffee style of coffee called the Robb Wolf blend caught whatever you want, it lasts longer. The, the buzz last longer and there's no crash because it feels like my body's slowly digesting all the fats and it, I don't know, it just works. I know I don't, but I'm not a scientist.

Speaker 1:          01:27:19       I'm not a doctor. I don't think it's a placebo effect because when I drink black coffee, which we do all the time here as well, sometimes Jamie, we'll just make the black coffee. I feel like I crash. It goes up and it goes down and I think it just gets in your bloodstream quicker, isn't it? It's not attached to fats. I love it. I love the buttery on my top lip. When you can get like it tastes good, tastes fucking good. I like it. For breakfast, I w I mean, look, I made sure that I get a lot of nutrients. I make sure I get a lot of healthy leafy green vegetables. I eat a lot of spinach and Kale and Broccoli and all kinds of, I think it's very, that's one of the most important things to get is get healthy plant based nutrients. I think it's one of the things that's missing from a lot of people's diets. You don't give it a fresh vegetables, but you know, sometimes I'll, I won't eat until like, you know, two or three in the afternoon and the whole day. All haven't you haven't eaten since noon today? Yeah, I haven't had bulletproof coffee and um, I had a protein I worked out too. I worked out and then, uh, maybe two minutes.

Speaker 3:          01:28:17       I think the, I did battle ropes. Oh, did you really? Like you're riding an elephant. Yeah. Is Con bomb Alexander the Great, speaking of getting his con, I watched the 300, the new 300 John Wayne played Gingiss calm the movie. Oh yes, I did played it. We played it on the podcast before. Big [inaudible] dog shit. So sorry to interrupt. No, it's okay. It's so bad. It's worth talking about. It's amazing. Maybe we could pull it up again. Pull it up again John. Wayne is Gaviscon cause it's so fucking stupid. There are a lot of Asians around. How that new thing a hundred though. Terrible. Oh really? It's a hunk of shit. Ooh. How about snow piercer what's that? I've heard it's one that Jamie was telling me about. Yeah, no

Speaker 1:          01:29:01       I haven't seen it.

Speaker 3:          01:29:03       They they they, it is the first product that is now proving the video on demand is going to be better than movie theaters because, I mean think about how pimp you've making your place to watch movies. I mean mine is, I, I fucking lock down my man cave surround sound. I got post screens going so I can go like this and it's Kinda like, uh, like, you know, I feel like I'm getting sucker punched picture. You was like a two by four that you slap under. Don't like one of those fucking, you know how they lock up like a castle door along with a big fucking bolt. Oh, I love it. I put my Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. It's my favorite. You should have a red light that goes off when your wife needs to get ahold of you in the, we should get ahold of you. We have walkie talkies and they call me. They call me papa bear. Goldilocks. Papa bear. Goldilocks. Rapala. No, you're such a maniac on my donor. My daughter's talking on walkie talkie. Lango copy that. Uh, that's so funny. Go for it. Go for Goldie locks. So ridiculous about that Lucy movie. That looks awesome. It looks like dog shit. Yeah, it's the same thing over and over again. How many movies

Speaker 1:          01:30:05       take where someone takes something and they become superhuman? You know? Oh, it's fucking limitless. It's Lucy. It's this. It's that. You know what's going to happen? She's going to win and then it'll probably like wear off at the end and she become a normal chick and she'll get knocked up and live in the suburbs and then the CIA will drive by her house real slow just to make sure that she's not fucking flipping cars through the air with a brand anymore. But she'll be writing a blog. Yeah. You remember how like the Bradley Cooper movie limitless. Fascinating to the end. They wrapped it up with a fucking bow of shit. It's like the way they ended it with so dumb that he like figured out how to fucking fix it all on his own so it doesn't like how, how did he, how did he solve the one major problem with this stuff that it wore off and fucked you up after it was over?

Speaker 3:          01:30:50       Are you ready for the greatest movie ever? Okay. Uh, with your kids. Have you seen the Lego movie? Yes. Amazing. The greatest fucking movie. Everything is awesome. Move for adults. Kids enjoying. Yeah. Let's see. Gaviscon John Wayne is tag. Oh, they made a preview of the recut version. They tried to make it cooler

Speaker 6:          01:31:14       and civilization. Ancestors, that's fine. Dying be without bloodshed. The cal bad. The set looks, my spirit may forever counseling, protect the crates, all fat and shit. Hot. Listen to me. There are moments where wisdom Jim Oga, then I listened to you. I'm Oka and are moments for action. Then I listened to my blood. I feel less tired or a woman is from a backhander. I've taken you over white board ty and I take your dowry tomorrow and our Gut, I make gift of it. Dwayne con. Oh my God, please. My strength in CG of Wang Con city. Hi [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:32:22       First of all, how bad an actor was John Wayne, apparently all you had to be as white back then. Yeah, that's it. It's fucking terrible. I mean he did remotely sound Mongolian Talk Mongolia. But isn't it also weird that that was like essentially like you talking about like was it probably like the sixties right? They made that closer to the gang con days than today, right? It's 2014 obviously that was closer. I mean not a lot closer but close enough where it's measurable. Yeah, but so far off of what the Mongols were really like. Whereas today you could never make that movie like that. Could you imagine like let's say if Ryan Gosling wanted to play kingus Khan and he was just fucking sleepwalking through it, just like that John went click, you'd be like, what a fucking piece of shit is this? But for whatever reason where people dumber, then

Speaker 3:          01:33:19       definitely and no one, no one had any reference for who Genghis Khan,

Speaker 4:          01:33:22       but how would they dumb or then if they had already invented the atomic bomb, we couldn't invent the atomic pop. So someone in the 1940s Oppenheimer was way fucking smarter than anyone in this room. I'm sure Oppenheimer did not want to see that movie. I'm sure it was like, wait, you have to do is Asian. Right? But like think about how many geniuses they're work Teslow was the beginning of the 20th century. You know that you're, you're talking about super, super geniuses, incredibly brilliant people, but yet the general population would accept a hunk of shit like that. I mean that is a really bad movie.

Speaker 3:          01:33:56       This is a theory that Duncan I got into and I had the, I had an idea and I asked Duncan about it and Duncan took his, I took the idea to the next level, but the idea was I was trying to Google what Christ's Iq was. Let's see if what he got on the Iq test and it's zero it within, never had accused back then knowing I never didn't exist. How about Jesus Christ? So, but that was like, I wonder if like Jesus was smarter than the average person are dumber than the average person. And Duncan brought about premise he had were that everyone was basically like a mentally challenged except for Jesus who was the first person. So it was like something about Mary, like you had basically visit the baseball behind your ear and they're like, here's Morgan beans. But, uh, I think that was Dunkin's theory. I'm fucking ruin conversations I have with people. Don't get hard on yourself too. You always do these seven guys right there, but you were doing great. But, uh, but I think that, I think that, I would guess that based on the internet or the information that we have, our level of basic intelligence has increased exponentially from 1960. Well, I don't know if our intelligence has,

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       but our knowledge has, that's right. Yeah. I mean the, the, the, the capacity to hold information seems to be the same. That's why we run into issues like there's an issue with that. You know, the, um, the, the Dunbar number, like 150 people, they keep 150 people in your, in your mind, that's what you, your memories capable of holding in their hundred 50 people that you have intimate relationships with, that you're friends with. Anything more than 150 shit gets really weird. You run out of hard drive space and it's a, this is a scientific number and it's based on the capacity to recognize how many people are in a tribe and they average tribe. When human beings were, you know, coming up was like 50 to a hundred, 150 people maximum. That's all he needed to have. Now, especially if you're a guy like Bert Kreischer traveling all over the world doing stand up comedy, how many fucking people have you met?

Speaker 1:          01:35:51       God dammit, Dude, you've met thousands and thousands of people and if you might run into some dude, you might do a show in Australia and you run into that dude and he like, Hey, remember we talked last year? And you're like, no, I've, does that freak you out when someone says, Oh yeah, we hung out. Like we worked on a TV show together for a year and you're like flat line, like, you know what really freaks me out when I can't remember it. I can't remember. I can't remember. I can't remember it at all. And then, oh yeah. And then it starts appearing in my memory and then I'm like, where was that? Where was that? I'm just pulling it out now and like, God, I totally forgot about that. I've met people again like after having met them before and then all of a sudden the whole evening where I met them like, Oh yeah, we were talking to Doug and he told you that thing.

Speaker 1:          01:36:34       Oh yeah. Oh yeah. But before they like a stranger, there were a total stranger until whatever it was started reappearing in the back of my retrieving your data back from the cloud. Yeah, I don't get it then that's the next Lucy movie. What if they didn't make her smarter? They just increased her hard drive so she can remember everyone. That's why she prayed them. The basis of the movie as she's using more of her brain said like the chemical let you open. That's one of the reasons why that movie is going to suck because that premise has already been disproven by science. It's not that you only use a certain percentage of your brain. That's not true. Like this idea of humans only use 10% of their brain. They said that in the, in the preview. I was like, no, they don't. They, they're just starting to understand what parts of the brain are responsible for what functions.

Speaker 1:          01:37:17       And one of the things that they're doing this, this is really interesting shit. I think it's called transcranial TTC, d something or another. They're putting electrical stimulation on various aspects or various, uh, points of, of this, of your skull. They're putting electrodes on your skull and they're inducing like this state by emitting electricity and it feels like mosquitoes are biting you. There's a great, um, episode of this podcast I listened to all the time. Radio lab, a recent one. I think the most recent one in fact is about this. And this woman went through this, uh, this, they're, they're learning that it can increase your capacity to learn, like dramatically, dramatically and provable. So this woman went through this thing where she went through sniper training. So, uh, in this sniper training scenario, they a first you'd do it sober. They, they take you through this thing.

Speaker 1:          01:38:15       There's a, you're at a, a checkpoint like in Iraq, you know, it's all video simulation. A bomb blows up and the suicide bombers are running at you with bomb vests on and they're shooting guns at you and you gotta figure out who's who and pick them off. Well, the first time she did it, it was super frustrating. She got like three out of 20, and she just kept and kept getting fucked up. It was driving her crazy. He was driving her nuts. Then they put the electrodes on, they juiced to brain, they put electrodes on her brain and her, uh, the, the side of her head and on her, uh, left arm somehow or another, like her right brain, the right side of her head and her left arm. And then she was like, this isn't going to do anything. She didn't feel any different.

Speaker 1:          01:38:55       She, she said she felt like a metallic taste in their mouth, like she had just licked an aluminum can or something like that. Then went through the thing and she said everything moved in slow motion. She said 20 minutes went by in three minutes. When it was over, she couldn't believe it was over. She's like, how was it over? She's like, it's, it's only been three minutes. And they like, no, look at the clock. She looked at the clock. 20 minutes has gone by. She was a hundred percent accurate, so from three out of 20 she got 20 out of 20 the second time and she thought it only took three minutes. She just went through this thing like she was an expert and they were like, she became like an assassin. Yeah. Yeah. Ohio state actually just had a guy that was paralyzed and they've been, they found how to control the brain for him to actually a move for your first time or something like that. Yeah. That's different. Yeah. I mean, we're talking different, we're talking that's, that's still fascinating. But this is through the average person. This is not people that are paralyzed. The average person, they can increase your capacity to learn by using this transdermal stimulation. Transcranial direct stimulation, I think it's called.

Speaker 3:          01:39:59       I got, I got a serious injury head injury I had in college. I got knocked unconscious. What happened? You've got to fight and a dude kind of fucked me up. I wrote a song, a comic song and he didn't find it very funny. So I beat you up and knocked her unconscious. My good friend too. He was my really good friend. Yeah, he was older than I was. He was, uh, he was old. He was like two years old, three years older than I was. What was it about, what was the song about? About our fraternity? I sang a song about a fraternity, like lighthearted song making fun of all the brothers and that were older than me obviously, and he didn't find it funny and so, but I was as friends, so I was like, we're not going to fight. But then I was, I was wrong and he grabbed me and like suplex to me and, and like, like you know, like the, like you would like if you're going to throw someone like full, you know what I mean? Like over your shoulder backwards, let him, I let him on my head and I was, I was out and then I came to, I was really confused and then I came to, and he was on of me

Speaker 4:          01:40:54       trying to say, cause I think I would swallow my tongue or something. I'm not certain. But then I, but then I got lost. I walked around campus and I got lost and I was really confused as let you go. I was in maternity, it was, it was a fight and then I just walked away. Like I just walked away. It was during exams and so I just walked out. So your fraternity brothers didn't take you to a fucking doctor who's there? You got knocked unconscious. He was the only one there. It was, he didn't take you to a doctor? No. No. Well he just beat me up. I don't think he was concerned about my wellbeing fraternity in Florida. Did you stay friends with this guy? No. You should've called the cops. Uh, yeah. Well, yeah, there was a lot. I mean it, long story short fucking asshole.

Speaker 4:          01:41:30       Yeah. So, um, he uh, so I, I went to the hospital and I had some headaches. I had like minor amnesia, like meaning I had a hard time remembering some shit. They asked me where I went to school and I was like, Jesuit was my first answer. That was my high school and my roommate at the time was there and he was like, oh fuck. And so then, uh, I did a bunch of testing and the doctors were like, I think everything's going to be fine. I think it'd be fine. I think you just got your Bell Rung and uh, Ms Back when they used the fifties, when, when was this going on? This is 1992. Did they not understand how fucking dangerous concussions are? Not at all. That jazz me crazy man. People that have a lack of understanding about head injuries try it drives me fucking nuts.

Speaker 4:          01:42:12       He could go to a doctor. There wasn't, it was Tallahassee, Florida, probably hoping you're dying to get rid of him. So many fucking my mind. My Dad's really, uh, really nervous kind of guy. And so when I went to Tampa, I got like the thing where they put you in the thing and the cat scan or whatever. And then they did this thing where they put electrodes all over my head to all over my head. And then they put this light in front of my face and it flashed like, it was like the rainbow color, but it was just, it was just going like different, like pulses and like different things. And you had just sit there with your eyes closed, but you could see it clear as fuck with your eyes closed. And then they did a test in your brain. They did reading comprehension and they're like, I think are going to be fine.

Speaker 4:          01:42:50       He just had to, you know, you got a concussion and you were out. You'll, you'll come back. That guy's a piece of shit, man. Yeah. Suplex you and your head. You know that that is so fucking dangerous to do that to someone on the street. It's so dangerous. That's the number one way to people die in street fights. You know, they fall and hit their head on the street. Yeah. There's a guy in college that punched the guy and knocked him unconscious and the guy landed on a, uh, on a, on a parking curb, a parking thing, and, and died. That happened to a guy that Kevin James used to work with. Kevin James was a bouncer. He worked with this other bouncer and the bouncer punched the guy in the head. The guy got knocked unconscious, fell back, hit his head on a curb, dad, fuck, it's a course. I mean, think about what it would be like if you hit someone in the head with a curb stone. Yeah. You know, going 30 miles an hour, just smash him in the head. Well, that's what it's like when you fall backwards and you hit the curb and you're, you're, you're basically getting your fucking brain bashed in with all your body weight. It's super dangerous. So this dickhead

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       fucking whatever. I'm sorry. Yeah, it's okay. So, so what happened from then on?

Speaker 3:          01:43:55       No, nothing. I, I recovered. They were like, don't, uh, the doctor was like, Shit, you stay away from booze and any like pod or anything in that last couple of hours. Not even, I think that first night I got drunk, I was like, I think I'm way more drones, like just fucking candle concussions rule. But uh, but yeah, it was, I was fine. I'm,

Speaker 1:          01:44:18       yeah, that was fine. This, um, episode of Radio Lab, if Ben, nobody wants to listen to, it's called nine volt Nirvana. And if you've never heard radio, radio lab before is my favorite podcast right now. I really enjoy it. It's really good. It's so, so well made. And they, each one of them, it takes a long time to make once they only put one out like every few weeks or so. But it's really good stuff. Really good stuff. But it's all about this transcranial, it's called transcranial electrical stimulation. And, um, if you just look up transcranial direct current stimulation, um, there are many, many articles about it online and many, many different studies that have been done. Really fucking fascinating stuff. But if you're learning something, apparently there's a bunch of dudes have done like do it yourself versions of it too with a, you can apparently you could build your own transcranial electrical stimulation device. Uh, uh, with some shit that you buy from radio shack.

Speaker 3:          01:45:17       I'm fucking really make myself gay or oh, you mean get it right. It's like Ghostbusters at the beginning when he has all those things on his head. There was a video

Speaker 1:          01:45:30       or, or there was an article might be bullshit, but a guy was a rugby player who got knocked out and he got a concussion and turn gay. I don't believe that

Speaker 3:          01:45:37       we've talked about that. Remember this pit, the before pictures. He's like, Hi guys, I'm playing rugby. He looked totally straight. Totally straight. Looks like cause whatever it is, rock Hudson looked like it did. I bet. I bet so many dudes were tricked into sucking his dick. He has the king of the among goals. Tell you now rock. Yeah. How many dudes were tricked in? Well, that's the Travolta move, right? Isn't that the idea? I've heard stories about guys we know. Nevermind. Hey, keep going. Why stop now? What are you saying? I've heard it. I've heard stories of like of like famous people that Scientologists maybe no, but famous people who have gotten dudes that are like young comics to suck their dicks. Oh yeah. And then they're like, I don't know what happened. I was telling. Sure. Yeah, that's totally true. Yeah. This is something that's straight guys get a kick out of doing that or, or gay guys rather get a kick out of getting straight guys to suck their dick. I was a friend that

Speaker 1:          01:46:36       I'm used to work at. Um, uh, he was on um, a fear factor and a couple of shows that I did. He was a good guy. He was a wardrobe guy and he was do's long gang to get big Mexican gay guy.

Speaker 4:          01:46:50       Awesome dude. Um, but anyway, he would tell me all the time that like, like guys would get drunk, like straight guys who get drunk and wind up blowing them. And I was like, really? He goes, yeah, we're having me blow them. I was like, really? And he goes to, they would always say, I've never done this before. I go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:47:10       Like I don't, you know, then, then the question is

Speaker 4:          01:47:15       where they really straight all along or were they, you know, were they just the alcohol brought out the gain? Um, they were really gay and they just didn't want to admit it.

Speaker 3:          01:47:24       That's, I have a joke about that, that I'm not homophobic. I'm a Homo Kondracke like I'm comfortable if your game's free one night you'll get me drunk and trick me into it and I'll like it. I'll be like, aw, this is my jam. Tom Ziglar and I went out with a gay dude one night. Our trainer was gay and he was like, why don't you guys come out with us? And Tom and I were like, like, and he's like, well, go to gay clubs. Tom was like, you want to go? I was like, fuck yeah. Why don't you guys come out with us? We're going to go to gay clubs and Tom and I went and like Tom dressed like youth spruced up. Did he really collared shirt on. I'm like Tom. And he's like, what were ms can be jeans. I'm wearing skinny jeans and a collared shirt and shoes. It was fucking his wolf. Shoot. Whatever those big bear paws fit into. But Tonya has so much fucking fun. We Sat, we sat together drinking like the gay strengths that tastes awesome by the way. What's the gain strength like a like cosmos and Pina coladas. Nope. Delicious am Tom and I were like, no beers. We're not, we don't have to do shots and left. It's like a like a sex on the beach. We had the best fucking time.

Speaker 4:          01:48:28       Well you remember Scott Kennedy and he's like the street straight as gay guy of all time. Yeah. Yeah. He's gay as fuck. But you would think he's like the straight beer drink in football fan. I always had a football Jersey on. He died, died a few years ago. I don't remember what, I think he died in his sleep and then he has sleep apnea or something like that. He's a big guy. His stroke, I think Justin Martin Dale Party. What's that? I didn't know Justin Martin. Dale is gay for like the first six months. I knew. How is that even possible? I never saw him drunk. I think he,

Speaker 3:          01:48:54       when he's not, when he's sober, he, how much does watch them walk? Guess Scott is fuck Scott Kennedy that Scott Kennedy and I were drinking one night. I kind of wish I could remember how this story exactly went, but we were sitting drinking in Sacramento and uh, and I saw this dude walked by. That was just a mess. I was like, God. And I'm, but I wasn't thinking. I was like, can you imagine being him? Like having to have his life and I, it's calculus that doesn't turn you on. And I go turn me on. And Scott goes, one man's trash is another man's treasure. One man's trash is we're fubu jerseys or foot football

Speaker 4:          01:49:33       jerseys. Well, one of the other, yeah. Yeah, I gaydar doesn't really work well with comedians though. Cause if he'd hang out at the comedy store, you would say half the people were gay. But they're not supposedly, you know, there's just the large groups of people that cause their comics and they all know each other. They all of act gay or the

Speaker 5:          01:49:48       normal. What are you talking about? I never explained so Benji's gay, you know Benji, I would think Benji's gay, but he's not. And Tony, perfect example. I would think Tony's gay, but he's not. You would think, oh Tony Asher, who was gay. Why? Just cause he's small. I mean I guess you could hold them down and fucking, no, no, no. I think it's just like little things. That's how he carries himself. You know, like a lot of people like he's like, he has a joke about it. He has a gay face, you know it. Well he's very small, but I wouldn't think he was gay. I don't know. He's just against maybe, well how he dresses. He's personally to be cardigan thing. It's a very funny thing. The cardigan thing, like are you remember the Ari's Cardigan phase? He was giving me a hard time about fanny packs.

Speaker 5:          01:50:28       I'm like, bitch, I never said a word during your cardigan phase. What about Ari's like Bozo the clown phase where he just shaved like hit like a bald spot but left the hair around the side of his head. Do that one day though. Oh, it was that one day. I thought it was a while. No, I remember he grew a Hitler mustache. Yeah, that was weird. He shaved. He's Jewish, I think if anybody's allowed to rock a Hitler mustache. Oh yeah. Remember when he had to wear his hat on the side of his head during that time we had like a Hitler mustache and then he had a small house, like a beanie beanie. He wore sideways. Yeah. He's being silly or is that an interesting fucking guy? Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:51:04       a real kick out of that guy. He was the first one that proved he h he in a weird way, kind of changed the way I hang out with people and me and him talked about this. A lot of people have heard me say this, but [inaudible] was the first person that I saw. I saw the amazing racist and I really liked it and I went up to him at a comedy club and I was like in Tripoli did the same thing to me. And I said, hey man, I saw your amazing racist. I really liked it. I think you're really funny. And it was like the, the tension between two comics who didn't know each other, just was no longer there. And then we became friends and it was like all you have to do is really just be nice to people and people are nice right back.

Speaker 5:          01:51:36       What do you mean? Like, is that confusing? Yeah. Like, well I know how to find water. You Rub a stick on a rock and it makes it water.

Speaker 3:          01:51:45       No, but like sometimes with comics it's like there is this, like if you don't know a comic then you're like kind of Kentucky about it. And so like you're, yeah, there's a lot of comedy and like think of like the different scenes that go on and everyone was like, ah, yeah. Like just a, that kind of shit. But I saw Ari and Sam Aaa did the same thing. He came to me one night. He was like, I really like that joke years. I was like, oh my God, we're friends now. I like you. You like me. I like me. Yeah, some

Speaker 1:          01:52:10       comics definitely. I'm a standoffish thing about other comics, but you know Tony Hinchcliffe and I were talking about that the difference between the nineties when I started out at the comedy store in [inaudible] 94 there was no comradery there. It was, it was all for, it was like this weird, everybody was out for themselves. There wasn't like a lot of pal around together. It wasn't that same sort of an environment. I mean it was a lot of good comics and people would go up and they would do sets and stuff like that. And you know, it was always kind of a, an interesting place to perform, but it was, there was no like comradery amongst comedians like there is now, especially like our group, that's a very, this is a very unusual group. All of us, like Diaz and Ari and Dunkin and everyone together be in pals and Cowan.

Speaker 1:          01:52:55       And that shit just didn't exist. We w I had never known like a group that was like that tightly knit, that work together all the time to constantly went on the road together and brought each other around and then support each other. And then the podcast thing came along and everybody started doing each other's podcasts and supporting each other and having each other on their podcast to promote things. And that just doesn't, it didn't exist before. It wasn't like that. There was people, comics were way more standoffish. It was way less of a, a pal around thing. And one of the things that I think that I attributed to changing it, um, it changed a little bit in New York. First tough crowd changed it. It kind of started to see that these guys were buddies and they're palling around together and then they started doing ona together, like Ona, change it a lot. And then guys were hanging around at the cellar a lot and it became like, there was more comradery, you know, he started to see that that more calmer ona made a big impact. They made a big impact because everybody that went on ona became kind of pals, you know? I mean there's always little disputes here and there between guys that would go on it. But it was like opie and Anthony became like a place where everybody, you know, everybody who did it, you were like a part of, I was like a club. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:54:11       it's, I was, uh, I've, I've told this to Jim, but I've a been a huge ona fan for a long time. And those moments when like, like the other night, the other day when they were, had Pete rose on and did you hear the one with rich Vos and Pete rose? Rich Vos was on fucking fire. Yeah, he was, he was on fire and I could not stop laughing. And you think and like I know all those guys from starting in New York, I and I, it is identical to how they'd hang out with each other the best I've ever, one of my favorite moments in standup was when, uh, Patrice used to heckle Voss so they'd go to the Boston comedy club and fosters get on stage and it was almost like watching, it was almost like watching Eddie and Hixon, you know, like, like they were wrote, they'd roll together and put, but Patrice would heckle him now, no one knew Patrice was a comic. He was just a big black guy in the back and foster get on stage and he's like, man, Yo teeth looked like tombstones and boss would come out and they go back and forth and it was so much fun and I was like, this has got to do something. They're going to be something they're going to do later. But it was like, it was amazing and foss was so fucking quick buy used to sit in the back and just watch it. Like watching two masters go at it.

Speaker 1:          01:55:16       Yeah, Vasa very quick. And that led to all those guys became friends from opiate. Anthony that, yeah, I don't know that the camaraderie between Comedians is so important is it's huge because comedians on their own like, like I dunno this is this something that nomadic sort of thing that comics do. Traveling the road being on your own all the time. The guys who like really depressed and sad, they'd be like never would pal around with other comedians. They would like, they would never go on the road with other comedians or they would take some on the road that they didn't know. Just like that was just a job like you open for me and we're not really friends. Yeah. That, that I, that always seem to me to be the worst way to to it. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:55:56       it's fun to be going through some shit and call one of you guys and just be like, oh fuck this is this. This is how I'm feeling. Like Joey, he's Joey's might go to phone call always. If I'm depressed I'll call Joey. Cause it's, you know, it's, the conversation can be no longer than three minutes and it's going to end with that going to be fine. Cock sucker. Yeah. Well I've coffee next week.

Speaker 1:          01:56:13       Well it's like perfect example, secure segora had a terrible show thinking Winnipeg and he uh, yeah, he came on the podcast and talked about it and because we know we're all comics together, you know, we're laughing and having fun just, you know, completely got through this terrible tragic memory and it became hilarious. It became like fun. I love when he bombs so rare. He's really fucking funny.

Speaker 3:          01:56:41       It's like when it's like when you shoot a bear with a bow and Arrow, but they don't know they've been injured yet, but they know that if you shot with a bow and Arrow, I watched a lot of hunting. I watched a lot of hunting videos like I used to, I used to, if I, if I ever got too fucked up within, I'd watch hunting in Florida, it's very easy to get really bear bear hunting from, in my opinion, you've done it. I've never done it. But all the videos are, they like put a box out full of food and then they'd sit in a tent and then the bear would come out and they shoot it with a bow and Arrow and the bear would get hit, but it would almost feel, it would seem like the bear be like, oh, what the fuck was that?

Speaker 3:          01:57:13       And then you'd see the look in the bear's face where they'd be like, I don't feel good. I'm going to go rest for a little bit. That's how sick girl looks. When he bombs. It's like, it's like, he's like, he like, he looks at you like, did I get, did I get hit? And you're like, and you're, and you know, he's been hit by an arrow. My favorite one was in, uh, in, in, uh, in Pearl Harbor. Me, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, me, Thompson, Hoorah. And Russell Peters. And, uh, I go up and I do okay, but maybe I was dirtier than I should have been, but it's totally fine because the only real thing that we're, don't make fun of the Hawaiians, that was it. Don't make fun of the Hawaiians. And don't bring up Pearl Harbor. What? Tom's opening joke. He's like, man, it's a lot of fat people.

Speaker 3:          01:57:54       He's like, I heard island life was slow slope. I know they were talking about their metabolism, so then he says I got lost walking around. Luckily a Japanese guy pointed out the directions man, those Japanese, no, this place like the back of their hand. I mean he bombed so hard that when he got off he was like that early sweats like where you could and he's like, he's like, oh, pretty good and you're like, you might want to go back to your nest and rock. You know Tom's going to lose his shit. That video of where I'm shaving Tom. That's that week? Yeah. How many more after the show before how many shows did you guys do? One. Just one and pro. Just one. I went up, I was a little dirty. I think Tom went up, had a rough set. He, he kind of went back, you know, Tom is not right for corporate gig in that opinion and there's a corporate gig.

Speaker 3:          01:58:39       It was the, for the, it was like maybe I want to say 3000 people on at Pearl Harbor, sitting in lawn chairs with their families. What was the Gig like? What, who is it for? For the Pearl. For the USO. Ah, that's fine. That's a military gear, not corporate kid. That same same energy. So I, and so then Tom sits next to me, this is my favorite part. Thompson texted me and Russell Peters comes on stage and you can hear there's a murmuring now mind you, we're at war with Iraq and Russell Peters is a little brown for their taste. And Tom Goes, I never realized he looks like the enemy. And Russell Peters is by the way, didn't acknowledge it did had a great set, but you could hear that kind of like they brought up one of the like and Tom and I were in the back like this is bad.

Speaker 3:          01:59:25       We the next day. And you thought it was bad because he was brown. It was only because we had gone to rifle training the day before and Russell had randomly chose not to go randomly. And the first words that rifle training was, there's one rule here. If it's brown and it moves, you kill it. And Tom was like, he didn't bring ruffle. Let the fuck. Imagine if you're Mexican and you're in the fucking army and they tell you that shit. If it's brown and it moves, we kill it. Whoa. That guy said that. And we brought our wives to it. We, we've had arrives to rifle. We shot every gun they had. We brought our wives and the girls were like, right before we went, stepped in, they go, can we go to the bathroom? Or like, yeah, go to the bathroom. So we walk in and the guy's like, uh, I thought they were going to be six.

Speaker 3:          02:00:08       He's like a real military guy. And we're like, yeah, the girls went to the bathroom. He was okay. And then Tom goes, hey, do me a favor. When they get in, act a little like aggressive to them and misogynistic and let's just see the looks on their faces. So the girls walk in and he was on, well, typical lady's got lost. Don't know what time it is of their man's not next to him. And Christina and my wife started bubbling like what the, and he's like, ladies do follow the men. They'll know what to do. Thank you gentlemen. And he got into character so good that Tom stepped in. He's like, it's a joke. Everybody hits a joke. He's doing it because we asked him to. This guy was good. Wow. That's funny. Yeah. That's hilarious. Yeah. It's funny that you can get a trained killer to just crack jokes.

Speaker 3:          02:00:51       Oh, the guy was, it was, that was a really fun trip. If it's Brown, kill it. If it's Brown, it moves. You kill it. Do you enjoy that? You have to Osha this junk. Have you ever done those? Nope. No, I don't enjoy them now. I mean, I do them, I do them, but I would just, I'd be doing it to bomb because you can't really be dirty. He can't really curse. There's a bunch of rules you can't talk about. And I'd probably break all of them and the, those corporate things I've learned I'm just not good at.

Speaker 1:          02:01:15       Yeah. And there's also the thing of like, you got to go to military bases and just the whole thing about it is I am 100% in support of the actual people. But the idea behind it is this, I'm not going to Afghanistan. I'm not, I'm not going to Iraq and telling jokes, you know, I just like, I get that they need a break and they need a entertainment and I get, it's a great service, but all that, that's just that, that is not a place I want to go. I think everything about it is fucking like, imagine going to Gaza right now. Cracking jokes, magic. If you had a fucking Uso tour gig and Gaza, like what is going on with Gaza without fuck is going on with Israel and Palestine. What started all of this? If you paid attention to this, uh, very subtly, dude, I'm trying not to, but I have to.

Speaker 1:          02:02:04       I mean everybody, I get all these tweets, you're not coming and going. He goes, well look man, when I, when I see about death and destruction, I don't gravitate towards it. I don't like try to study it. And try to figure out exactly what's going on so I could pick a side and have a viewpoint. I just get sad that there's more of this bullshit in the world. I don't, I don't like feel like I'm going to fix it with my opinion and I don't, I don't, I keep hearing all these people have these ideas. One side will say it's definitely Israel's fault. One side will say Hamas is like, uh, like Bill Maher said something about Hamas is like a crazy ex girlfriend. You know, like a crazy girl. Like she should eventually have to smack her or something like that. Like I don't, what the fuck he said it was some, some weird like hacky thing that he was saying in regards to a war that's going on between this really troubled part of the world.

Speaker 1:          02:02:59       And you know, the, my number one thing about war, the number one thing is on an individual basis, regardless of, you know, take out the context of the civilization they live in, the culture they live in, the, the, the language that they speak. These people don't know each other. Why are they fighting to the death? They don't even know each other there. You're launching missiles at people you've never met. They're shooting back at you. It's crazy. The fact that we still do it in 2014 I don't give a fuck who side you should be on or what it represents. It represents the fact that we're still retarded. It represents the fact that we still can't figure out how to overcome our differences with any other way other than shooting missiles at each other or dropping bombs or setting up IED or shooting people at checkpoints or whatever it is, whatever method that they choose to to show that we're still in some way barbarians and that's what it is.

Speaker 1:          02:03:57       We're barbarians with way better weapons. It's fucking crazy. I understand that sometimes there's acts of aggression and you need to protect people from people more barbaric than us, but it makes me sad. I mean, that's the only other way. The only way I know to describe my feelings about anything that happens with war in the news. Anytime violence breaks out any anytime, like this Gaza, Palestine thing, I just get just depressed at my core. I can't read about it. I'm not going to pick a side. I'm not, my side is the human side. On my Mama. I'm on the human race side and the human race is not benefiting from this fucking shit. I don't know what it would take to cause Palestine and Israel to be cool with each other. I don't understand it. I don't, I don't know how you could hate each other for so long.

Speaker 1:          02:04:50       How you could have so many different points of view. How you get a guy like Dennis Prager who says Palestine will not be happy unless Israel is dead. There is no negotiating. I'll come. They're fucking people. They're people. I don't know how they're communicating. I don't know if they understand each other's language. I don't know how much of this is just deep seated ancient shit that these people have just carried with them forever. But my position on it, I'm not taking any sides. My position on it is the whole thing is completely fucked. The whole thing fucked. It's fucked that people still do this. It's fucked until we recognize it. It's fucked. And maybe if I lived in Israel, I'd have a totally different state of mind. Maybe if I lived in a place that was regularly attacked and at war I would be more harsh and more closed off to it.

Speaker 1:          02:05:38       I don't know. I don't know. But you know, for people who want my take on it to keep tweeting me about it, that's my take. My take is it's, I'm tired of living my life. I mean, look, I'm 46, I'll be 47 in August. At what point in time? Um, I mean as a, as a person, I've grown and matured and I understand myself and how I interface with other people and society and culture much better. I'm much better at it. But when I look at like human beings in general, I don't necessarily know if I see that much growth when it comes to international relations, when it comes to war, when it comes to the way we react to each other, I just, I keep seeing the same fucking patterns repeating themselves over and over again. Whether it's in Iraq, whether it's in this idea that we're supposed to invade Syria, where you get fucking Dick Cheney who goes in the news the other day and they did an interview with him.

Speaker 1:          02:06:31       He said his number one regret that he didn't invade Iran at the same time they invaded Iraq. You know, I just, I'm disappointed in, in human beings, I think there's gonna come a certain time, but we have to get to the root of the problem. Why did these things always have to end in unfathomable violence? Like what is it about human beings and is it the way we're being led? Is the way we're being governed or is it something about us? Some fundamental aspect of what we are as a, as a being. I don't have the answer to that, but I know that me as a person who hopes for the best wishes for the best in in human beings, I see this and it just makes me sad, is no other way to describe it. I know that's a very limited way of describing things and it's, it leaves a lot open to interpretation. That's how I feel about it. I just, I look at the news every day. I mean, look, we can go to CNN right now. I'll go to cnn.com and I guarantee you it's fucking death and destruction this weekend. Uh, 47 people shot five dead and just Chicago.

Speaker 1:          02:07:36       Well, Chicago was going through some serious fucking gang violence. Really? Yeah, sure. It's gang violence. And uh, I was talking to a guy last time was there, it was a former cop and his take on it was that what happened was there was some major players in the drug game that were arrested and they left a vacuum because there's these gang members that got arrested and there was a power vacuum that's being filled now with violence. So yeah, it's probably more people dead right in there then it isn't Gaza. More people been killed by cops than died in the Iraq war.

Speaker 3:          02:08:10       So funny if you said to me though, would you rather go to Gaza or Chicago? I'd be like, oh, Chicago.

Speaker 1:          02:08:14       Yeah. Well most of Chicago safe as fuck. It's the south side of Chicago. You go to the ghetto. That's where you might as well be in Gaza. I used to do a great club down there, riddles in the south side of Chicago. Hello blog. When did you do the south side of Chicago? But

Speaker 3:          02:08:28       when I first started, the guy named Brent, I was just talking to them about it. So a guy named Brent used to run it. You get two grand for the weekend. Oh you had to do was Friday and Saturday, two shows each night. It was really nice and it was an all backup, all black tee shirt off and fucking saying no fucking [inaudible] songs. I would do it, I could have whatever I would, I remember my first joke, the first time I worked there was about Duran Duran and some black ticks. Like who the fuck's he? I was like, it's a band. And she's like, oh no, no Brent, you better talk about black people, mother fucker. And I was like done. So I spent the rest of the week just to an all black jokes and I fucking loved it. I had, so I guess it was like getting away with everything.

Speaker 3:          02:09:09       And I remember like a dude stood up and proposed to his chick in the middle of one of my shows. I was like, fuck yeah, I was chaos. It is pretty crazy. At 47 people shots in Chicago. Yeah. It's weird how it like most cities it's always like the south side is the bad side. It's like, well not in Tampa really. Yeah, that's about as good and south Tampa is the best area to live in. Really? North Tampa is where all the rednecks live. That's where I grew up. North Tampa nor Tampa. Is that all elevated trucks? Shit, you got it. Fireworks, homemade fireworks, fireworks, hunting gators, heightened gators when you were a kid. Oh, when I, when I, when we, I'll never forget, when we went to look at our land, my dad bought like a piece of land in North Dakota and North Florida, Tampa and he was like, we're going to build on it.

Speaker 3:          02:09:54       We went out as a family to go look at it and there were these two rednecks that had chased this other redneck in his underwear up on a mound in the middle of the lake and they were shooting Bibi's Adam, Mike is your land. This is our land in my day and this is our lake and land that, that little mound and we had a picture cause it's still there. It's still there. And they had chased the boy up there in his and he was in his underwear and my dad was like, hey everybody cut it out. That's enough. And My, they looked at my dad and they go, we called him fair and square and I was like, oh my God. And this is private land. It was like your land. It was a lake. There's a lake they were on, they were on a boat.

Speaker 3:          02:10:27       So it was a lake and the, and it was an island that was like maybe 10 feet off the shore of where our house still, it's a big lake. It's a pretty big lake. It's not all yours. The whole that is not all ours but a, but and then the other side of the lake was like North Tampa. It was lutes. It's called loot. We got in the car that day and then radio stations changed and I remember the song was downtown loot. This is their intro to the song downtown. Lutes kick off your boots. Give a Holler in who's he hall. And that was our new neighborhood. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:10:56       Jesus Christ. Why didn't you research it a little bit for you fucking bought land there? No, cause it was, it was cheap property. I've heard it's like solid childhood. I fucking know. Probably hung gators.

Speaker 3:          02:11:07       Yeah. I think the whole state of Florida, it's considered the south side of the United States. That's a good point. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. The decay of the country. Florida is a weird fucking place. I can't go in there next month to Tampa, Jacksonville and Orlando. Death Squad. Yep. Oh, well Tripoli. Yeah. Yeah. Let me set you guys up on my buddy cow head. All right, cool.

Speaker 4:          02:11:30       Callen just got back. Kallan was just in West Palm. We were just talking about how they should have to, you did that. You should have to have a fucking passport to get there because you don't realize like it's like they live like it's a tropical country. Like people were just drinking and partying Barksdale, but the five o'clock in the morning, it's a different world. And if you go to anywhere else in the country and then go to Florida, you feel like you're in some crazy tropical vacation place. Is Parrots patronizing is the weirdest thing. How much everyone drinks and everyone just gets drunk all the time there. That's all I remember going to Florida. Every barge is packs. You get to take the edge off that meth. You know what's crazy is I have friends in Florida who have uh, who have been to rehab and stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:12:10       One of the most of the talking on the phone, that doesn't even make sense, but it's so funny they consider a marijuana like bad in Florida of course. But I've told my buddy, I was like, dude, why don't you just move to Colorado and then no one will think you have a problem. It's like they wouldn't be able to fit in. If you live your whole life in Florida and you go to Colorado, they're going to go, you gotta go, you gotta get Outta here man. We were fucking place. Florida and Colorado are like opposite ends of the earth. They are like polar SPEC. You fucking, your watch won't work there. Your compass will be backwards north, south, south north to try and get you out of there. Colorado is perfect for weed. Florida is perfect for a fence. What are the next day? What did the next states that are going to legalize marijuana?

Speaker 4:          02:12:50       It's a good question. Not really. They're going to medically, but I dunno about legal. Legal. Medically legal is important. It's the gateway to legal, legal. But what happens is they start feeling the impact, the revenue impact. Colorado is making more than a hundred million dollars this year and way more money than they thought they were going to. And the tax rate is crazy high, 39% so if you buy weed, their 39% of it goes to the government. So the government is essentially a drug dealer. And you know, the people buying it are all tourists. A lot of the people are buying our tourists. While we were just in a, I just did a wise guys and Salt Lake City. You ever do that? No. Uh, after hearing you talk about it, I want to do it. Fuck it was awesome. Just fucking great. First

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       of all, the clubs perfect. It's the perfect. So everybody had told me about it. Diaz told me about it. Duncan told me about it. [inaudible] told me about bird was just there. So I was, I, that's it. I'm gone. So I, I, I book it, I go there and it was fucking magic meant people couldn't have been cooler. It's like you think like you're going to salt lake city's bunch of Goddamn Mormons. No, those aren't the ones coming to your show. More means only like 20% of the population there. The rast is cool as fuck.

Speaker 3:          02:13:58       Mormons are always cool as fuck. Nice. I dig Mormons.

Speaker 1:          02:14:01       The nicest cult members ever. They're the nicest. They're less creepy than Scientologists. Scientologists as second nicest as far as cult members

Speaker 3:          02:14:09       were. Scientologists almost switched me one time. Whoa. What happened? Dinner Party got a little tipsy and I was like, so actually I was sober I think, but it was like a, and that's when you lost me. I'm not believing the story anymore. I was like, you guys believe in aliens? And they're like, well you could, I mean you could sit will it down to that. And I was like, is that, is that weird? It was this in Tampa is in la or water. Oh my dad used to represent l Ron Hubbard. Whoa. Yup. You Dad knew him. My Dad knew the mother fucker. Whoa. My Dad. Why did that Guy Die? I don't know. Long time ago. Right. God dammit. I wish I had more information. I wish I listened better. My Dad, my dad used to come out here, cause Clearwater is a port town. M l Ron Hubbard lived on a boat. So He'd come into different, yeah, we have a house in Clearwater. They used to come in to clear water. They have a huge Scientology center there. Yeah. It's, it's a huge, my parents,

Speaker 1:          02:14:55       you still live in Clearwater. Yeah. So, uh, the eye when I drive it around, there was like all these Scientology shit and I was like, what's going on in there? Like towns filled with Scientologists.

Speaker 3:          02:15:04       Yeah, my dad represented someone. Okay. Are Now, I remember my dad represented someone that the church tried to kidnap dad. I'm sorry if I'm fucking this up or if I'm not supposed to tell these stories because he, he's a lawyer. They knew over seven years, it's been a while. So he, uh, he represented someone, the church tried to kidnapped and hold because they were trying to get out of the church and the church was saying they wanted him back in. And my dad did such a good job that the church thing came to him and said, would you represent, are like cover all, like whatever it is, where they pay you money to not, um, to represent every case they have. And so my dad did that for like 10 years and they made it, made a ton of money. Then the church left him and then didn't pay for like two years. He died in [inaudible] 86. Yeah. This probably, and he died in California. Oh, interesting. So you didn't die when that volcano blew up? No, that's not real, Brian. That's a dianetics commercial. I didn't even know you were saying 86 I wonder if my dad will watch thing. I never asked. My Dad went over our numbers like 75 years old when he died. It's probably a Douche bag. Come on. This is terrible, right? It's a Scifi. So that was pretty cool. He's probably a Dork. Wonder if I could do that. He started,

Speaker 1:          02:16:13       Bro. Trust me, if you guys starts to religion and your religion is based on some of the worst science fiction writing of all that.

Speaker 3:          02:16:20       So here's how they're most switched me. Okay. Yeah. So they're like a, so we're at dinner and I said, you gotta believe in aliens? And they're like, well yeah, you can whittle it down to that. And I go, it's Kinda fucked up. And they're like, well, what's your thing? And I know you're gonna mock this by go, I'm Catholic. And they're like, so you believe in Jesus? Oh yeah. And they're like, do you believe that Jesus really like got gotten nailed to the cross and then putting a cave and then actually move the Rock and rose again? I go, no. Well I mean it's fig. It's figured it. And they're like, do you believe that Moses actually part of the cs are that no, actually put all the animals on the Ark. I go know their stories and I, and they're like, so you are admitting that there's some holes in your, in your religion. I go, well yeah, it's, you know, and then like do you believe in aliens? And I go, oh definitely. And then I say, you actually believe in the shit that we believe in. You actually believe there's life out in the universe. You believe that? And I was like, Oh yeah. And then I can, you'll admit that the thing that use your faith, you have questions about that. Like why wouldn't you listen to what we have to say? And I was like, motherfucker, this is how they get ya. Cause I believe in aliens.

Speaker 4:          02:17:18       So when they said that, did you like open yourself up a little? Relaxed and go tell me what it down. She'll shut down.

Speaker 3:          02:17:24       Yup. Just like I'm in camp. And the kid next to me touched my dick and it felt good and I was like, oh, that's a boy. Nope. Shut it down. Or like I'm watching naked and afraid and I see the ass. I'm like, that's hot and it's a dude. And I'm like, fuck, I just shut it down.

Speaker 4:          02:17:38       Okay, so you shut it down and you just didn't let him keep going. What are they trying? Uh, no, they were soft selling. What's the soft sell? Like? They always say, you should come by and put on some fucking hold these a Campbell soup cans that are attached to strings. So they read your mind.

Speaker 3:          02:17:51       They knew my wife to an acting group. There's a think called the the actors camp or actors group actors. Collum would know exactly what it is. The actors, it's a Scientology acting group. It's an Scientology asking group. And what they do is they'll, uh, they'll audit you halfway through the semester, the audit you and tell you what's wrong with you and what you need to work.

Speaker 4:          02:18:09       And when you say audit, what do you mean? As a Scientology version of audit for people think like, well you gotta check your taxes.

Speaker 3:          02:18:14       Yeah, Oh yeah, it's a Scientology audit. The audit you and say this is what's wrong with you as a person and this is what's holding you guys back as an actress. And so my wife was in it, my wife's best friend was in it and they came and these, these two people were in it and they came back and my wife's like, fuck that place. I was like, why? What's wrong with it? She's like, they said that this, this, this and that. It was all really accurate and I was like, what did they say about your friend? And it was, I mean it was like exactly what I would've said. I was like, the Scientologists seem to have a fucking, they can find your weakness or what the thing is that fucks you up. And then once you identify that it's real and you're like, ah, I've got to listen to what you say. Well, they have a lot of a lot of stuff

Speaker 4:          02:18:49       in Scientology and dianetics itself. Like they call it dianetics. That's what the book is based on. That's a lot of it can be beneficial if you need a structure in your life and you need some sort of like a framework on which to think and how to behave. They get you with that a lot. But they also in La, they run a lot of acting classes. I'd be the Scientologists who was like, Hey, when do we get famous? I was dating this chick, I don't know if I ever sell the story of the podcast is great. This is back in the early days before I had my no head shots policy back in the day. Um, yeah, I only dated a few actions before. I was like, all right, that's enough. This is fucking this. And then I dated a regular girl and she was so I was like, I'm

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       done with actresses. Which begs a question, how did your wife Never Act? Cause she's very attractive. Uh, whatever. Anyway, here's my story. Um, the, uh, the class that she was in was run by the scientologist and this Scientologists guy was like soft sell the whole way. But he would occasionally bring it up. Like one of the reasons why he can get into these roles and his, cause he's so comfortable with who he is and he, so he, he understands who he is as a person. So because of that he can abandon that and no, it's always going to be there when it comes back and that he can get into his, and I watch this guy teaching this class. Like she, this chick was so, it was so brutal. She would want you to watch her acting class. Like come watch my acting class. I'd sit, she just needed to be watched all the time.

Speaker 1:          02:20:18       She needed massive amounts of attention. And one of the things that they would do in the class was a private moment and that's what it was. And so you wouldn't be acting out a scene, you'd be doing a private moment. So what a private moment is, you get on your fucking stage and you start going through like pretending you're reading your email. This is like pre email. So it'd be like reading a book or something like that, pretending your washing dishes. And so, you know, she would like be walking around like doing her and people would just be staring at her and, and she was doing her shit. I understand. It's like learning how the idea was learning how to be completely natural in front of people and you know, and I go and I saw, I was mocking it. Of course, my mock everything and I go, yeah, I go, that's gonna fucking really help you when you have to actually talk and act.

Speaker 1:          02:21:08       Yeah, it's awesome. I go, it's not at all that what they're doing is just placating your need for attention by giving you attention in this weird way. You know, like now it's your turn to be the one that everybody looks at because that's what the fuck it is. You know, it was, it was nonsense, but it's, this guy would give this like Scientology soft sell that because of my religion and my, my deep seated understanding of who I am, I'm, I'm able to let it all go in a band of it. Meanwhile, he was at terrible actor. Oh, terrible. Terrible. They're all terrible. Almost all acting teachers saw chuck. They forced me to get an acting coach when I got my development deal with Disney. So I had to take like three or four classes with this lady. And I know I've talked about this before.

Speaker 1:          02:21:54       She was in New York and she uh, she would fucking, cause I had a development deal do a sitcom. She would keep saying that if there was a part to play my mom on the show that I was going to get her in front of the studio and she's going to play my mom. She's just fucking bitch was crazy. But I would do, I would read with her, you know, like we'd have to read and she was fucking terrible. Fucking terrible. And then I realize like if she was really good she'd be out acting like she wouldn't be teaching goddamn acting class. And you realize like the only people teaching acting classes or people that are fucking terrible at acting. And then I went on to do stand up, I mean obviously I was doing stand up at the time but went on to be more successful with stand up.

Speaker 1:          02:22:32       And then I realized that the people that were teaching these classes were all these dog shit comedians. Like when's the last time you saw a standup comedy class that was taught by anyone who's ever funny at all? They don't do it are you should fear did a seminar thing for comics. It was fucking great. He did it in Phoenix and he made a recording of it. I think he released it as a podcast but it was perfect. It was like the only time that I've ever seen like our real solid stand up, give advice to young comics did it for free. Totally free. No class is. And I think it was sort of his way of saying like let's fuck these fucking classes aren't what you need. This is what you need. This is how you write this. I get a manager, this is what you should do, this is how you should develop material, this is how you get work.

Speaker 1:          02:23:15       And you know, spent like a couple hours doing it and it was beautiful because all it's all you need. That's all you need. Yeah. The only thing else enacting class does, or rather a comedy class does let you go on stage, you know? But really the best way to do it, it's just go to a fucking open Mike night, right? I think so. Watch kill Tony. Well that's killed. Tony is a fascinating podcast for folks who don't know what it is. We just did it recently. Me and dom Irrera and Brian of course, and and Tony Hinchcliffe who's fucking hilarious. We did wiseguys together all weekend, Utah. But Tony's show is all about guys go up, they do a minute and then professional comics talk to them about their beds and some, it's like you get a grab bag. Some of them are really funny like that one bricks and bullets kid. That kid was in from a, yeah. Oh I know. Bricks and bullets. Barney cases. First set ever. He did on the killed Tony that we were on. Really Funny Kid. He's, if he keeps going, he's going to be a real comic for sure. And then the two chicks that you do it with.

Speaker 5:          02:24:15       Kim, Kimberly Kahneman and Sarah wine chick

Speaker 1:          02:24:17       who write a minute's worth of new material every fucking week. Did I do it with them? Yeah, they're fucking good. I know exactly what I'm seeing is that writing a minute's worth of new shit every week in their whole careers have been spent doing that from the moment they first get on stage until now. Like over a year's worth. They've been doing sets every fucking week amid a fresh new minute

Speaker 5:          02:24:38       that killed Tony was a blast. I did it with a, did I do it with cigarettes? Yes. The, and I did one.

Speaker 1:          02:24:45       It was so much fun. So fun. It's a real show. And you know what I was telling Tony, I was like, this show should be on comedy central. And that thought about, I'm like, no, it shouldn't be what it is. We're thinking of things. Things

Speaker 5:          02:24:54       we wouldn't be able to do. Like we wouldn't be able to have the Iron Patriot guy. We wouldn't be able to just like back. No. While we have fake ones though we we uh, yeah, we had now and we, we have like fake sponsors on each one. We have like we play music in between when people come up cause it's supposed to sound like a real comedy club when you kid up, you know there's like cherry pies playing when you were getting on stage or whatever. I really liked doing that. I'll tell you what podcasts I really like to, uh, first of all, Dan Carlin, if you're listening, I'm still waiting patiently for a hardcore, I'm

Speaker 4:          02:25:24       waiting forever. It's a lot of work too. I know, I know. I'm waiting patiently. I'm just letting them know people are waiting. That fucking guy puts in some work. Like those things are mini. It's like books on tape. I fucking love them. I sleep to them. I listened to while I sleep and I dream that I'm in that scene. Yeah. The what they do and radio lab dub does is so different than what we do. You know, I've done two of these today. It's easy lifting. It's not fucking, it's not the same thing. This is that this is easy lifting. That first one was that was like you, you, you were, trust me when I say you were involved, like you were listening hard and you had questions that were very technical and like I was watching the youth stream that was not easy lifting said, but you are also as these lifting.

Speaker 4:          02:26:01       So I think he was your, you think he's a great Jujitsu Guy? Oh well he's the greatest ever. Hixon Gracie. He's the, he's the like number one when you think about like greatest martial artists in a specific style for Jujitsu, everybody says Hixon Gracie, it's universal. It's not like one person says it and he's also his philosophy and everything. So it was still was easy lifting because I really admire the guy and it had real questions and you know, I knew him, I knew him for a while, I've known him for awhile. I've had dinner with them, you know, gone over Jujitsu positions with them. And then, and then watching you walk in right when Eddie Bravo and him were discussing positions and going over them on the ground, that was cool as fuck. But now it's still easy in comparison to what radio lab does or in comparison to what Dan Carlin does, especially because he's got to be historically correct on all these things as well. Think about all the different time periods. He discusses all the, he's got a read on them, do the research on and make sure he's got all his, it's

Speaker 3:          02:26:54       fucking great. You know what I want to do from an, I want to do an addition to my podcast I've been talking about kind of. I haven't really told anyone. Be Honest. Be Honest. I know you will. Okay, so my book did really well, but the audio book did much better than the book. Of course people want to hear me do audio books. So instead of doing another book, I'm just going to release an audio book for my second book, which will be fiction with me as the character and just do write a book about fiction book, audio fiction book. About what? About the machine that machine goes, takes a cruise and accidentally break let's Somali pirates onto the tray under the cruise ship and he's then got to solve the mystery. Just hear the machine now the machine. So it'll all be based on my own reality and lobby based in my own reality of like were you when you came on to decide very drunk but I love it.

Speaker 3:          02:27:43       Xanax too. Nope, just drunk. That's my idea. Well listen man, just because I'm skeptical doesn't mean it can't be amazing. I'll do, I'll do it just like I'll ride it like a book, like a fiction book. Cause I can't, I can't do another fucking memoir type book. Like I don't, I'm done stories where you can do your thoughts on things. You think a lot about shit. I can, but I, but I think it would be more fun to like do a potential shortly. Remember the book Fletch, like that character or like saw the movie. I didn't, I don't remember the book but, but like I want to do, but I want to do books like that where the machine is a character who's got to solve mysteries.

Speaker 4:          02:28:17       Listen, if you are a passionate about it, if you actually think it's fine, you definitely make it funny.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       Yeah, sure. You could make it great. It's just a matter of, you know, any idea, if you believe in it and you're creative and you're good and you chase it down, it'll either live or it'll die. I mean, you could try it and it turned into dog shit and then you abandoned and after a few weeks and laugh about it on the podcast or it becomes awesome. You know, that's possible too.

Speaker 3:          02:28:41       I've done some solo podcast where it's just me talking and uh, and I was listening to one, like a, to see if it was okay to post. And my wife's like, this is horse shit. I was like, it's me fucking know. Oh singing a song about Pi. Like I was like, cause you getting weird in your man cave it like, and I was like, if I was a pirate, this is a song I had saying, Oh that's so fun. And so I started singing this pirate song, but it doesn't sound like me, but I'm fucking obviously getting weird. And it's like we are pyre stove. He's scary. He goes, we're hair look so funny. Who is this? This is awful. This is your wife. Listen to your podcast. No. She walked into that and she was like, oh cause I'm listening to it. She would never expect it.

Speaker 3:          02:29:20       I'm listening to my own shit. She was like, Oh this is horse shit. Who is this? I go, are you being serious right now? She's like, yeah, it's really bad. I go, it's me. She goes, what did she say after that? She was like, who's [inaudible] podcast? Who's podcasts we won? She goes, Benson's, cause she thought I must've been high. Right. And I was like, no, this is my podcast. She's like, this is what your podcast sounds like. I go, no, this is what I did by myself. I haven't released. She's like, don't release it. Don't really sit. Meanwhile, people are like on Twitter now you have to. One of my buddies from the, uh, my book, I was very honest. I used everyone's names. I should not have done that. I know I've got a lot of fucking flack, but one of the guys whose name I use in the book maybe first and last first and land in the middle, in the middle of that podcast, he called and go, what the fuck? No, he was cool. He was like, he was like, yeah, I heard it was fuck it was. He was like, yeah, that's what everyone's been pissed originally, but then they're like, then they're like, yeah, I guess I was a little slutty in high school.

Speaker 3:          02:30:23       Jenny powers sent me a book. It was like was really upset.

Speaker 1:          02:30:28       Didn't Lucy snore Bush get in touch with Joey Diaz? Thanks. Because the way you remember

Speaker 3:          02:30:32       history, especially when you're writing a book, you do very honest, like I was just, I didn't think anyone would. We'll

Speaker 1:          02:30:37       read it. Well, the real problem also when it comes to people's memories is that they're terrible, minor, fucking horrible. Nobody really remembers what I mean. You will talk to someone who has a totally different memory of something. I've had conversations with people that have totally different memories of shit that did not, it just did not go down that way. It's not possible that it went down that way. And I'll explain to them why it's not possible, like physical hardcore reasons and they'll keep going on about it. Like it's a real thing. I'm like, God damn it dude. It didn't happen. Bobby was dead in 86 like you'll tell him he died in 80 you know he died in 1983 he was in a car accident. This is, we were talking about something that happened three years after his death. It didn't happen. Cause that happened three years after his death.

Speaker 1:          02:31:18       Yeah, no, no mean he was their man. He's fucking dead. He was dead and they don't, they won't let it go. And they just, in their mind, they have concocted this scenario. They put these events in a, in a box and then it no longer becomes their memory. It becomes them repeating the stories over and over again. And then there's the memory of the repeated story. Your memories fucking terrible out, up to a certain point. There's like certain very traumatic moments that I have reserved in my mind that are like flashes and then I whatever remembered is my recollection of those ideas and what I've said about those ideas. But those ideas themselves, like here's a perfect example. My entire taekwondo career from 1981 to 1988 fighting more than a hundred times. I don't think I remember more than two or three flashes of things happening really. Cause you from head injuries?

Speaker 1:          02:32:20       No, maybe for sure I have some of those, but more, um, it just, I don't know. I just, it just, I know what happened. I know I won this tournament, that tournament and no knock that guy out. And I know this happened. I know that was scary. And I know this was scary. I know my friend got knocked out, but my, my actual memories of those, like I, there's a video of, um, the, the guy sent me of me knocking this guy out with is turning sidekick. And I remember that I knocked the guy out with attorney sidekick. I remember that tournament. I'd want a bunch of fights leading up to the finals. Um, and one of them was that knockout, but I don't remember it actually happening. I mean, I don't remember it. I know it did happen, but like if I pulled into my mind, do I remember the guys coming at me and I turn and the impact of the kick and the guy goes flying?

Speaker 1:          02:33:05       Nope. Nope. Don't remember it at all. That was a pretty big, it was a u s cup. It was a huge national tournament was a big event. Nope, barely remember it. That's so crazy. That's life though. When I tell stories, like if I talk, like I've done some things where like demonstrate kicks on somebody and they're like, how the fuck can you do this? And I'm like, well, I used to be a taekwondo champion. I was, I won the US Open and I'll start and then almost I feel like I'm lying because it's not me. You know? It's like the meat today is a totally different person than the May event, but for whatever reason, the meat today has retained all these skills that I developed when I was younger. I mean I never let them go, but the fact that they exist at all in a, in a way that's impressive to professionals is very strange. So like demonstrate a kick, you know, and show somebody and they're like, how the fuck can you do this? I guess I've always done it, but I feel like I'm lying. I feel like I didn't really do that. Like I can't really do that, but I know I can, do you know what I'm saying? But I know exactly how shitty my memory is.

Speaker 3:          02:34:07       I had someone today on a meeting and they were like, tell them how your career got started. And so I said, well, 99 seven rolling stone magazine found me and called me the number one party on the hill country. And he was saying it as I'm saying it, I go, I'm like, I'm like, honestly, I said, I thought they said the day this is fucking insane. How could anyone prove that? Well, you, they wrote a story and they can research the story. No, and you guys haven't read it.

Speaker 3:          02:34:28       No one's read. It was like how many must've read it. Has Anyone in this room? No, but, but, but I'm telling them this is, by the way, this is, I'm laying in bed thinking this and then I'm like, I'm the one that's telling everyone that rolling stone magazine, no one read it. I mean, I have copies of it at home. Uh, and, and it's, it's, you can find it online, you can read it online, but the majority of people haven't read it. They just take my word as, as me going. And then I started thinking, what if, what if I like, I got a panicked, like what if I'm lying, but I'm not, I know I'm not. But like it's that same thing you said, where you go, where you go. I don't really remember. I remember small details and stories. I can remember. I can remember sitting down the day I got that magazine and I remember dust from our couches came up and the sun was coming through our top window at our townhouse.

Speaker 3:          02:35:11       And I remember seeing dust particles flying up going. One of my life's about to change. And I remember small details of stories when I met Igor, Igor and Sasha, Igor who is at the door when I met him, I remember that I was wearing a purple Kelty fanny pack that had lemons, sugar and a knife in it cause I was going to do lemon drops. I remember that distinctly because I fell asleep on lemon drop. It's like dip sugar and lemon and then you shoot vodka and then suck the sugar and lemon tastes really good. It's like a lemon drop was like a candy if it's, oh I see, I see. I see. But like I remember, I remember what I was wearing. I remember what I was wearing. I had told them I have a hundred times when I was wearing the night. We robbed the train and I, cause I remember I distinctly remember and somebody showed me a picture of it totally wrong.

Speaker 3:          02:35:53       Totally wrong. Yeah. I was wearing a white collared shirt. I was like, no, no, no. I was wearing a blue Obermeyer ski jacket. I wore that every single day in Russia, isn't it? Isn't it weird when someone has fake memories? Have you, have you ever had that happen when someone starts telling fake stories, like fake memories of you and you're like, what? I just say yes. Yeah, because I don't remember people who were like, remember the time you were in what you would call it and you ripped your shirt off? He brought me on stage. I was in a diaper. Sure. That might have happened. Like Mike Malone, you say an onstage and a diaper and you and alcohol. You might have, someone told me that you brought Mike balloon up in a diaper and you were, and I was like, oh, doesn't sound like me. It doesn't.

Speaker 3:          02:36:38       It does a little bit, but I just go, sounds like you. To me, I go, sure. It crazy is when you see a picture of something you did and you're like, I have no recollection of that. Yeah, yeah. Oh, totally. Yeah. Yeah. That's weird. We've got some old old pictures from our days at the comedy store that I totally forgot about it. I'll see it. I'll go, whoa, that's crazy. Or some of the videos at Brian took from back in the day. You don't even a video of a, the hooker that we talked to, their crazy hooker founder a couple of months ago. You found it. Yeah. You don't want, you want, you know what I'd like, I'd like to go back into my memories with like, uh, with some sort of Facebook tagging method and remember who I met. I used to work, I used to work out at the comedy store with Louie Anderson on Sunday nights.

Speaker 3:          02:37:19       Did he ever try to fuck you? Nope. Never wants, but he still has my maid tape from a John Favreau and Vince Vaughn made and gave it to him. I was like, it's really good. Watch it. And then he just kept it an aid. No note made was a TV movie with John Febrile, invincible. I was like, what you were doing, you were, you know, you went with a dominatrix one time, you were amazed. It was something really funny is, uh, and Louie, I absolutely love you if you are listening to this. He's the greatest guy in the world. And, but he had a heart attack during that time and he was at Cedar Sinai. And so I went to, uh, went to go visit him and I was like, I'm here to see Louie Anderson. It was like, and they were like, Ugh, like another one up to the top, like above.

Speaker 3:          02:37:59       Apparently a bunch of boys were just coming in and now, but like I went up to see him. There were like three dudes in the room. Fuck yeah, get yours. Um, wait, what was I going to say before that? Oh, I would like to go through and go, cause I remember sitting in the back with a bunch of guys that worked at the comedy store. Now, I know that those guys were all the people that I'm friends with. It's probably Dunkin and, and like all those guys probably work there. And they were telling me how funny I was and then I should start working at the comedy store. But I didn't know the hierarchy that these were all comics. I just thought they worked at the club. She, I gave them like the passing off of like, Oh, thank you very much man. I appreciate it guys. And they're like, no man, you should work here. Like this is your club. You would be good here. And I was like, I really appreciate that. Thank you guys. I would love to go back and find out who I was talking to. That's

Speaker 4:          02:38:46       wild. I wonder who that was. I drove around Louie Anderson's boy toy once when I was driving limos, when I just started doing standup comedy. Um, this, uh, this fella, uh, Louie had some sort of a thing. He was a young guy and uh, like I would just have to drive this guy anywhere he wanted to go. And we were both around the same age. I mean this fella, I won't say his name, but do I know him now? I don't think so. He was a comic sort of, and he actually wound up writing a book and went to jail for something, some fraud thing or something like that. Cause I remember I wrote loosely paid attention to him. And then when you could find people in the news like Google people, it was before Google, it was like, you know, some fucking net gear search or some point family.

Speaker 4:          02:39:33       Who was, what the fuck used? W W was the early searches searches though crawler, uh, [inaudible]. Anyway, this, this guy, I remember reading about something that he did. He, he had some sort of a thing that was getting attention like a book or something like that and then you want up going to jail. But uh, I was driving him around like I'd have to take him to the mall and take the end. He would just tell me, you know how he's opening for Louie Anderson and Louie Anderson's, his friend and this, I had no idea. And Louie Anderson, it was gay, but halfway through driving this kid around and were like, this kid is gay as fuck. Like there's something going on. It was, it was not just that he was, it was like I driving around a bimbo. It was like, you know, if you were like some rich oligarch and you had some, a little piece of ass on the side that you were, you know like, hey honey, you know, you want to fucking drive these guide, take you to store, you know, you do what you want. It was that sort of a scenario where, you know, he was like real cocky and talent, like giving me advice on, on comedy. Like, well Louie Anderson doesn't like this and this is what Louis does. This is Louise thoughts on, and when I opened for Louie and I'm like, wow,

Speaker 3:          02:40:44       Ben bail, you know Ben Bailey? Yes. He just Kinda, he did it does catch your eye. But he's a kid. He's a comic. I mean, he's like are legit comic. As long as I've known him a in New York comic, he gave, he bought Louis Anderson, he saw Louie Anderson and then it was like father's day was the next day. And so he bought his book and then said, Lou, will you sign this and make this out to my dad? I'm going to give it to him for father's Day. So he signed it, just give it to his dad and Ben gave it to his dad for father's Day. And then like the next day Ben's Dad is like, I'm flipping through the book. You want to talk? Ben's like, no. He's like, okay, are you sure? Cause I'll talk to you. I love you. And it's like, no, I'm sure the book is all about coming out to your father.

Speaker 4:          02:41:24       There was like, I'm okay. I think I'm good. Who Was it? Was it on the podcast that someone told us a story about uh, Louis cornering them in their hotel room? Who the fuck was it? I don't think it was on the podcast. I know what you're talking about. [inaudible] no, no, I think this trip. All right, let's just let it go. That's the one we're just talking. We just got done talking about how bad our memories are and then we're about to shame someone. It was Stan hope. I see his picture right there. Are you serious? No, no. Definitely not standard.

Speaker 3:          02:42:01       Stan. Stan hope has turned spit takes us into a game at our kitchen, in our liver, in our, uh, for dinner. What do you mean Stan hope we then I did a podcast, it was like fucking epic for our podcasts. He told me he fell in love with you. I fell in love with it so quickly I had, but he came and sat and had dinner with my family. Right. And they were like, when we play games at the table and Doug's like, I got a game, let's play spit takes. And they're like, how do you play spit takes now. Leanne is not like my wife's Pr, like pretty regular mom. And he's like, well I'll tell a joke. And when you think the punchlines hit you spit out what you're drinking. And island Georgia, we're like fuck yet. Go. So Doug, we'll sell a joke, you know, as I.

Speaker 3:          02:42:40       Dot I. Dot. Penis. I said, tell bench penis and they both spit their drinks. He's like, good job. And so everyone would tell a joke and everyone do spit takes and the best as they got to Doug and eyelid told Doug a joke. I had it on video too, but I lost my phone and Doug and Doug does the drink in Iowa says.dot, dot, dot. Dot. That's how a frog, it's across the road. And Doug didn't do a spit test. She goes, Doug, you didn't have spit taken. He goes, you don't spit off vodka, honey.

Speaker 3:          02:43:07       Eila played mustard hands with him. She goes, you won't play mustard hands. He's like, how do you play? She's like, you take mustard and you put squirt it in your hands under the table and you either have Methuen mustard in your hands or you don't. And that's the game. And dogs like, I'm fucking in and lands like, no, I can't get mustered out of clothes. No. And Doug's like, don't be a bitch. Come on. Now. I don't know if he said that, but you know, you know Doug, he told he, he Leanne stepped on the eyelids punchlines and I started crying and Doug defended Aila. He's like, that's what it feels like to get heckled. That island dope. He was the coolest fucking night I've ever had. I'm going to go to Hawaii. My wife was getting shot down and bitched at. Well, yeah, you can't get what you get.

Speaker 3:          02:43:45       You don't get upset. Zip It, lock it, stick in your pocket. You know, you get, you know, get upset. We got to go, man. We've got to wrap this up.
