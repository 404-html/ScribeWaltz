Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       Three, two, one, boom. And we're live. Hello God father, how are you sir? Good to see you buddy. You too. Thank you for having me again. My pleasure. What's up? Um, what's up with you? Well, before we start, I'm doing well. People ask me, how do you define wealth? You define wealth when your young daughter, before you step on the Joe Rogan Platform, writes this to you. She wrote, I love you. That's very cute. That's wealth. Other billionaire. Yeah. Um, it's a valuable, wouldn't say it's wealth. I think not being accurate with your words. By the way. I will probably keep this forever bore. You should. Yeah, definitely don't put in your pocket. What if you sweat on it? Okay. I'll leave it here.

Speaker 2:          00:00:53       So, uh, we were talking right before the podcast started about what I was just talking about in the previous podcast about Patriot and what Patrion is done to a deep platforms Sargon of a cod. And what I think we both agree was sloppy use of language on his part, but he was, I don't believe he was saying something racist. He was using a racist word though it was using it to describe someone who was actually using it against white nationalists against white supremacists and and saying how ridiculous they were being in that they were being exactly what they describe and when they're using racist terms to describe black people. But he did it using those terms and it, it wasn't a good speech like what he said. And one of the things that I'd said on the previous podcast is when you do podcasts, you're not mapping out what you're going to say, you're free flowing.

Speaker 2:          00:01:49       Sometimes words come out clunky. And I think that was what, what was going on in the case with him in this particular conversation that he had, there wasn't even on his page and patriotic decided to ban him. And I think for him that was something to tune of like $12,000 or more a month. Yeah, quite a bit of his income. You know, a lot of us then suggested that people move to subscribe star, which was a another platform that came out of nowhere and they've now been shutdown. How'd they get shut down? I don't know the details, so I hope I'm not misspeaking but I think pay pal and stripe decided that somehow they're violating their terms of their, their terms of service for whatever reason. And uh, apparently any payouts that have gone out are safe but you, it won't happen through paypal or through stripe. So you have to find some alternate platform, I think payoneer or something. Uh, so it's getting difficult to, to even receive the generous donations from people. So a lot of people, um, that are doing podcasts and doing these youtube shows, they operate

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       on donations, which is a really fair way to do things because you're, if say if you have a subscription based service and your asking people like save for Sirius satellite radio or something like that, you might not be happy with the content and you might, you might choose to cancels your subscription, but these people can get what they get already for free. Right. They choose to donate because they think it's valuable to them, which is really interesting. I liked that, that format, that model because for the longest time people were trying to figure out how could you make money off the Internet? Well the, the idea was advertising revenue and Sam Harris has a lengthly rant that's very accurate about this that he puts on his podcast. Ma often it's like a seven minute rant explaining why he doesn't use ads and why he prefers to have people just donate what they would like.

Speaker 3:          00:03:55       And he was one of the biggest patrion people. He was one of the biggest accounts on Patriot. He pulled his Patriot on two days ago. Right. And you know, that was a huge statement because to him that is incredibly valuable. I'm really curious to know what Jack Continuity, the founder of the, of Patriot, what his ultimate trajectory is going to be. As, I mean, as someone who would teach his psychology of decision making, we studies decision making who is housed in a business school. Uh, I think it would be a wonderful case analysis down the road. Follow the Harvard, we'll teach it of whether he just doubles down, which it seems like this is what they're doing because they released a statement that didn't seem to suggest that there was any sort of possibility of reflection on their part. Do you have a sense of whether the market will allow him to sort of realign his thinking or do you think he's just going to double down all the way to hell?

Speaker 3:          00:04:48       I think he's going to weather the storm if I'm going to be completely honest, not what I would like. What I would like is for them to support free speech and for them to make a differentiation between what is the actual hate speech and what is a clunky use of language, which is what I think Sargon did. Right. It was a clunky use of language and I think Sargon is a very intelligent guy. I've had him on the podcast, I've talked to him. He's a very bright, and he made on the show several great points. Yeah. He's a very smart guy. Um, when he was on it, just what he's on someone else's show doing that. Uh, you know, I felt like, and this is one of the things I said in the last podcast, I feel like if people decide that what he did was offensive to them, to the point where they decided to not renew their subscriptions or not continue to send him money through Patrion, that's probably the best use of that format and the best way for them and the market to decide. That's really, I think, how it should be done incidentally, regarding the end word, and I'm sure Jamie will now double check what I'm saying as he always does. Uh, there was a dean

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       at some university, I think out maybe in Seattle, I could be wrong, that at some point had suggested, uh, someone had asked which book a student that asks which book should I read? Or I can't remember the exact story. And I think the title of the book was the n word. And she had, I think the dean was a, was a woman I, if I'm mistaken, uh, had simply recommended that book, but she said the word out loud, sad. And she, he or she, I can't remember again, the person's sex got into trouble. So, you know, I wonder if we shouldn't just sort of demystify this word in an if, if, if, uh, if people weren't so, I mean, we have to now say the n word, we have to say the r word. I got banned from twitter for 12 hours because at one point I was interacting with some schmuck who I called retarded, the generate a schmuck, whatever it was. I can't remember the exact combination of consults and I was banned for using the r word. So I mean, where does this anime w how many more words do we have to remove from the lexicon? I mean, don't give these words so much power. Don't, don't be so sensitive. I mean, I know we've talked about these kinds of issues in the past, but does it not seem too outrageous that someone who recommends a book with the title being the n word or it

Speaker 4:          00:07:22       gets into trouble that meets and saying, well as even better one Netflix, there was an executive at Netflix that was forced to resign, uh, due to my friend Tom Segura is comedy special. And my friend Tom Segura has a bit in his act about how there's certain words that are just gone you can't use anymore. And he says, retard. He's like, that word. You can't use that word anymore. And he goes on and it's not about using that word. What he's basically, he's not like, he's not justifying the use of the word, he's just, it's simply stating that this is a war that you could no longer use. So they get attacked a bunch of letter writing campaign from mental health organizations and people dealing with people that have disabilities and are saying that you're, you're being able list and your being discriminatory and all these different things.

Speaker 4:          00:08:16       And they're basically trying to silence him. Even though if you look at the actual bid itself, he's not using it to describe a person. He's just essentially acknowledging that the word exists. So this guy who was an executive at Netflix says in a meeting, you can't use that word because that word, it's like saying nigger around black people, right. Just says that you're gonna get in trouble now. No, I said it in the earlier show too. I'm just saying when I read Sargon of our cods thing, like I said, it's preposterous to say the n word and I've said the n word before. And in most cases I say it,

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       but he actually said the word and the reason why he said the word, the reason why I just said the word is because he was trying to demonstrate like that this is an offensive thing, like saying retard is just like saying that he gets fired for that, for simply making this comparison that you know, and we're talking about uncensored standup comedy. By the way, this is a network that features that word prominently on several different comedy specials in multiple situations, whether it's cat williams, multiple uses of the word Dave Chappelle. I mean that word gets thrown about like a beach ball at a fucking concert. That word gets tossed around a lot. But this guy saying it because he's white. They like, he knew enough of your work here, sir. Speaking of comedy and sort of political correctness with comedy, uh, and, and my forthcoming book, I have a section where I talk about professors who got into Celani.

Speaker 2:          00:09:57       We've all heard about the comedians getting into trouble for violating some politically correct dictum, but professors, many cases, very, very high profile professors getting in trouble for incredibly innocuous jokes. And actually I bought a list of names cause I thought I might not remember them. Can I mention a few? The few of the cases. So Lasar Greenfield who was the, uh, president elect of the American College of surgeons and the Editor in chief of a journal called surgery news. W had written an editorial a few years ago where he was talking about the antidepressant benefits of coming in contact with sperm. In other words, it, and this was based on a peer reviewed scientific paper. Actually two of the authors of that paper are folks that I know of quite well, friends of mine. And they had demonstrated that women who have protected sex versus unprotected sex and up scoring differently on these depressive measures.

Speaker 2:          00:10:58       In other words, there was some sort of protective element to actually being exposed to sperm. And so in his, um, editorial, he made a joke. It was during Valentines, he said, so now there is a gift that a man can give a woman that's beyond flowers or chocolates or something to that effect. He had to step down from being president of the American College of surgeons. He had to step down from being editor in chief because a whole bunch of women were very offended by that sperm joke. Now the, the, the authors of the paper and question wrote a brilliant response. The response where they said, how, how could he be treated in this way when all he was doing as actually literally reporting the data, the findings from our peer reviewed study. So that's one example. Another example is a certain, uh, I think his third tim hunt, who was a Nobel Prize winner in 2000, I remember this one.

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       Yeah, right? Uh, who, who he basically, he was a speaking, I think had in Korea at a, you know, gee women in science conference where he varied in a jocular way, said, you know, it's a real problem when you have women in your lab. They fall in love with you, you fall in love with them. And so it's better to have segregated labs. His wife, by the way, as a staunch feminist who's a very prominent scientist and she confirmed that he's hardly, you know, a rabid sexist. He went through all sorts of health. Yeah, I remember that. And he was joking and he was joking. And I, in the book I discussed several other of these examples, so, so imagine you would think that a unblemished exemplary career as a scientist up to getting a Nobel prize, good potentially protect you, but one comment that someone decides can, can unleashed a tsunami of outrage and you're dead.

Speaker 2:          00:12:48       Well, I think the problem is reacting to the people that are reacting to the right. It's not the common itself, it's the cowards that are running things that give into that. And the Netflix thing is particularly disturbing because it was internal. It was people that were working in this department that apparently went and protested and they just decided that his use was egregious. And he shouldn't be able to say those sounds with his face. See, see, I, I get a lot of letters from people asking me, well, you know, I'm facing a similar situation. What should I do? Uh, professors out? And my answer is fight back hard. So I've had a couple of these situations. I had a guy on twitter, the guy, the guy who money referred to as a retired, started, started contacting my university, trying to get me fired when, when it wasn't working with his tagging my university on twitter, he actually contacted the HR department, the Human Resources Department at my university.

Speaker 2:          00:13:48       This is a random person. What's a troll? You got in touch with a troll and you gave him what he wanted attention. And then he just started to run with it. You basically gave him an opportunity to score. He's playing a video game. Exactly. But now here's what happened. The, the university's hr person contacts me after hours. I mentioned this actually recently on the Ruben report. The, the, the, the lady in question contacts me to say, look, here's a complaint that's been filed against you. Now, my first instinct was, oh, someone in my job as a professor at the university has complained about me, which I couldn't think who that would be, but I would think that that's where the, the, the template of their influence over me would reside. No, they had actually taken seriously a random person on twitter contacting them and filing a complaint under the guise of he's a student. Well, he's not my student. Right? I mean, if a student, uh, costs me in an alley to Mug me, I can't fight back because Bruh, he's a student or I'm allowed to, to deck him. Right. So this is a guy that I'm just having fun. I mean, I'm doing it

Speaker 3:          00:14:51       with a smile. We're going back and forth the size that he's willing to go as far as try to get me fine. Now let's suppose that he had succeeded, let's suppose that I hadn't fought back because basically what I did with the university, I said, are you literally thinking that it is reasonable for you to be monitoring what I do on my twitter account? And the example I gave her as an analogy, I said, if, if I see you coming out of the pharmacy with your daughter and I feel that you're speaking to her in a correct manner that I don't agree with as a parent, can I report you to the university? And that pretty much ended the conversation very quickly. But the fact that they felt sufficiently in bolden to actually reach out to me to address this complaint, shows you how chilling the environment is.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       It is. Right. But let's play devil's advocate. Sure. If I was someone who was taking your class or if I was someone who is very sensitive or someone who has certain ideals or morals and the professor who's teaching the class that I take called somebody a retard, I would, I mean, just being honest and I love you, they, then I would, I would say, why is this guy doing that? Like that's a stupid thing to do. Like why are you engaging with these people online and these, right, these base insults like that, this tasteful insults, fair enough. And engage with people like that. I mean literally the reason I do it as once in a while my wife falls asleep. I don't feel like working on my scientific papers or my procrastination or whatever. I'm tired and I'm on twitter and I hated your advice to try to not engage with people. Some idiots catches my eye. Oh Gee, I use the word idiot, idiot. Strangers. Okay. It didn't come.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       So someone, someone, our word catches my attention and I decide to spar with them. You, you, you like to get into the octagon and do mma sparring. I go on twitter and I have fun with some idiot, but I just enjoy it and usually we both laugh it off and we move on. It's just part of my personality, right? I'm, I'm, I'm a fun guy. I could be deadly serious and very academic and scientific and as you've correctly pointed in the past, I could not take myself seriously. It'd be just one of the guys. So this is a manifestation of that now that this person felt sufficiently in bolden and his indignation that he would try to fire me. That's where you should be focusing on sort of. I don't think that's real. I don't think he really felt so emboldened. I think what it was is he recognized that there's a climate today where a person like yourself, who is a professor who uses a certain word that is deemed to be offensive by society, that he can call you on that word and get you caught. You got caught up in a net of your own doing, sir, while I'm still here, smiling and looking fan. So that's okay. Do you do look 10 d, do you regret using that word at more than anything I regret that ever get sucked

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       into these battles. That's, that's it as much because again, it's a slippery slope today. It's retired tomorrow. It's more on the next day. It's schmuck. Yeah. Well that is true in terms of like were people don't understand calling someone a retard, like say if you're a 30 year old person today or 25 year old person, let's try 25. Um, you realize that that is forbidden. Taboo war when you and I were 25, that word was nothing, right? That word you would, you'd get taught called it by your teacher, right? I mean, it's true. That was, and it, and it was known to be someone who was retarding your growth or retarding the class or saying things that were retarding development of ideas and, and logic moving forward that are, you're, you're a roadblock. You're a pile of rocks in the road, right? You fucking retard. Like that's how people talked about it.

Speaker 4:          00:18:45       Like that's how they said it, but then it's become a new word that's victim to this war on words. Because you're not saying you have down syndrome, right. What you're saying is you're a dumb person, you know, and that terminology, like, especially the word retarded, it is not even used medically. Right? So it's, it's not a word and the to say that there's no nuance in this word cannot be used again about a really stupid fucking person. Right. You know, I, I, as you know, you probably know because I've sent you some clips of my infinite soccer skills. Uh, I used to be a very serious soccer player. Now if you, you, you know, this as a, as someone who fall in the MMA, there's a lot of trash talking, right? So the, the amount of nine this time, now I'm a professor and so on, but the amount of trash talking that I both dished out and was the recipient of actually allowed me to be a better person today.

Speaker 4:          00:19:44       It's, it's a fun of antifragility, right? I mean by, yes. So, so when you create a sanitized environment, you're creating a fragile system. You creating fragile human beings. So if, if the, if the worst stain in my 54 years on earth is that I use the word retard on this person, I'm doing pretty well. Well, I'm sure it's not the worst day, but uh, yeah, it's not that big. It's not that big a deal. The only reason why it's a big deal is because of the climate. Right. You know what you're saying is this is a stupid person. You're, you're not accusing him of having, uh, you're not mocking a, a mental disease or disorder, a genetic disorder. It's not what you're saying. And everybody knows that, but they just decided that this is a new word that is now taboo. A new sound you can't make with your face. Yeah. Want to move on to other chore. So first I wanted to say that, uh, I was very excited last year. It's completely different. This is a very hard segue with last year, one of my former professors at Cornell won the Nobel Prize in economics. That's pretty powerful. Yeah. I first semester, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       at Cornell, I took his course. His name is Richard Thaler. Maybe you should look into inviting in here. Uh, I'll, I don't know if he does a lot of these podcasts, but he should do your podcast. Uh, he won the Nobel prize for really the, the area that I started off and before I developed all the evolutionary stuff that I'm most known for, I came out of a tradition called behavioral decision theory. Is that, does that ring a bell at all? Have you, do you know that? Is it all really not totally know. So classical economists have this, uh, if you like stylized homo economics, this vision of how someone who is rational ought to behave. And there are these axioms of rational choice. So for example, if I prefer car a, toy car B, and I prefer carby to Carsey, I must prefer car a toy car.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       See that's uh, that's called the transitivity action. Someone who doesn't abide by this is behaving irrationally. If I tell you, what do you think of this hamburger that has 90% fat free, it's the same thing as telling you that this hamburger has 10% fat. Those are two isomorphic statements. It shouldn't alter your preference. Yet we see repeatedly that people don't behave in the manners prescribed by classical economic theory, by, by homework analogous. So re Dick Faler is the gentleman who, uh, demonstrated how many of these axioms of rational choice are violated in behavioral finance. And for that he won the Nobel Prize in economics and he came after the ones who originally wanted in 2002. Danielle economen, you probably know his book thinking fast and slow is I run the ball. Yes. So Daniel Conaman and his collaborator, Amos Tversky were the pioneers of that field and that's really the tradition that I came out of.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       My doctoral supervisor was part of that gang of guys who spent their careers demonstrating that classical economists are wrong. In my case, I became frustrated with that whole paradigm because it became clear that yes, economists have it wrong. How many more demonstrations can we show that they are wrong? I was much more interested in knowing why the brain is structured the way that it is enhanced that high gun to evolutionary theory. But I just thought that I would give them a shout out since he was a former professor of mine. That's pretty awesome. I'm just happy there's people out there trying to figure these things out so I can read what they say and repeat it and know what I'm talking about. Um, I want to go back to target things being fragile and antifragile. I mean, I think that's a really important point. Develop and I don't mean develop thick skin, like become accustomed to racism or sexism or homophobia or rudeness. It's just, I'm not saying that we should just tolerate those things and we shouldn't seek to improve our culture. We definitely should. But as a human being, um, this celebration of all things triggering this, getting upset at every single thing

Speaker 4:          00:23:46       that comes your way and making it out to be some massive complication, I think it's a direct result of how easy society is and out simple. Our lives are complicated in intellectual ways, complicated in emotional ways, complicated in psychological ways. Cause I think a lot of the way people live their life is very unnatural, but simple in terms of not worrying about predators, not worrying about real violence, not wearing about real strive, never worrying about food. I mean, it's very rare that people in this culture, in this day and age are starving. Right. You know, which is what a huge problem for most of human civilization. Most of human civilization people had a struggle to find food. Now, for the most part, it's very rare, right? And I think all of these things have led us to seek enemies where there are none and to go out and find these problems that really are not that big and make him out to be huge. Right. Because they're fragile and you know this, the idea that, let's, one of the reasons why I liked that expression, snowflake, like some, some people get really upset if you throw that word. The idea is that every snowflake is unique and special, right? Right. That's the idea. And that you, you are unique and special. Maybe. Maybe you're just lazy. That's true too. You know this, this is our work. Yes. I probably shouldn't say that either.

Speaker 5:          00:25:15       I could link what I just mentioned about classical economists to the social justice warrior ethos. So classical economists viewed the human condition through very cold calculational calculus. You certainly like humans, rds, they, they, they instantiate these algorithms without any emotions, right? If I prefer a toy car be at for car beater car, see, I must prefer car, a toy car seat. It's all axioms of rational choice. There are no emotions in these models. At the other end of that continuum lies the social justice warrior because all of life is through only the triggering of the emotional system. There is no engagement with your cognitive resources. It's all about outrage, anger, frustration, and so in a sense they're antithetical to each other. The classical economists, in his worldview, there are no emotions. The social justice warrior, in his worldview, there is no cognition. Of course, the the right way to be is somewhere in the middle. The right way to be is to know when to engage your cognition and when to engage your emotions.

Speaker 4:          00:26:22       Yeah. Isn't that the issue, right? Is that there's always the middle and that things are rarely black and white or one and zero right? Often very complicated. Well startle.

Speaker 5:          00:26:34       Going back to aristotle had argued about sort of what we now would call her, I would call the inverted u shape. So for example, if most things, the middle is the right place to be. All things in moderation, right? If you have too little of something, it's not good. If you have too much of something, it's not good. Somewhere in the middle is where the right virtue is and aristotle had thought of that several thousand years ago. I'll give you a specific example. I'm, I'm not sure if I've mentioned that before in this podcast. Perfectionism right follows an inverted u shape. If you have too little of it, you're not sufficiently detailed oriented, your work suffers. If you have too much of it, which I'm happy not happy, I'm displeased to report is me. Then it could be stunting because I checked my work 73,000 times before I sent that off because God forbid I might have a comma wrong that, so there is some happy medium of proof on the perfectionism scale where we should all strive to be. Well, Aristotle said that for most traits, that's where the optimal is. That's where the inflection point is.

Speaker 4:          00:27:38       Hmm. That makes sense. I mean, I'm not one to argue against aristotle. I thought you were just saying you're not wanting to argue against me. I'm not one to argue. It's either one of you. I just think most issues that people were arguing for or against, one of the real problems is that they are married to their initial point. Yeah. And they argue that looking for a victory, they're trying to move a ball across the line and they do it by any means necessary, including by mislabeling people, by mischaracterizing your positions on things and categorizing you in some really easy to dismiss place like you are all right. Or you're, you know, you're a fringe right person or, I mean, how many people have been called the Nazi over the last couple of years? Have you've been called the Nazi? Yes.

Speaker 5:          00:28:34       So when, uh, I was supposed to speak an August, 2017, uh, at a event titled The stifling of Free Speech on university campuses, it was on a university campus. It was shut down. The irony was lie areas. It was with myself, Jordan Peterson, uh, another clinical psychologist or an MFA and faith, Goldie, a journalist. Uh, anyways, uh, and then we held the, the, the, the event about three months later. But the people who shut us down had put out a facebook page where they said, we don't want these white supremacist Nazi's and Toronto. This is to a Jewish person who escaped persecution in Lebanon. So yeah, it's insane. It's cute.

Speaker 4:          00:29:21       It's cute. It is. I mean, they can't, they can't be honest. Yeah. I mean, this is not, they don't honestly believe what they're saying, but they don't care because they're just trying to move that ball. Right. And the fact that that's tolerated and that not just tolerated, but it actually influenced your speech and you guys weren't allowed to put on that event. It'd be a shame. Shame on the university for giving in shame on them for not putting their foot down. Shame on them for not examining who you are, who Jordan is, who or who any of those people are, and realizing, no, you're lying. You, you are a problem. You calling these people white supremacists and Nazis your a problem. Right? And you're a liar and you're defaming these per, this is defamation. This is your, your lipel. This is terrible. What you're doing is something that we should shun.

Speaker 5:          00:30:08       But I think it speaks to what you said earlier when you said it's all about winning, getting the ball across the site. And that's a, that's another thing that I talk about in the book is the difference between the ontological ethics and consequentialist ethics. The anthological ethics is where you have moral absolute, it is always wrong to lie. That would be at the ontological statement. The consequentialist a bent would be, well, it depends on what the consequences of the lion is. If, if, if it were to spare someone's feelings than it might've been okay to lie. Right? And so I are you that a lot. The problem with a lot of these enemies of reason is that they have a consequentialist relationship with truth, right? It doesn't matter if you violate truth, if there is some greater goal that you are pursuing. Whereas I come from a deontological perspective when it comes to truth.

Speaker 5:          00:30:57       Truth is truth. No matter who, whose feelings it hurts. And so I truly think certainly as a scientist, you truly have to have a, the anthological relationship with truth. This is precisely why weren't a lot of people ask me, do you think that there is for, and I think we even mentioned that last time I was on your show 16 months ago. Uh, is there any forbidden knowledge that you shouldn't do as a scientist? And my answer is always an unequivocal no. As long as you are a honest adhering to the scientific method, you should be allowed to traverse any intellectual landscapes. Intellectual

Speaker 4:          00:31:32       landscapes can be problematic when they deal with things that are very uncomfortable for people. A big one is I queue, right? That's a giant one. And that one has triggered so many accusations of racism and

Speaker 5:          00:31:48       well, there was this French dressing. Go ahead. There was a gentleman, I just covered him on my, on my youtube channel. I don't know who he is. His name is, I think Noah Carl. He's a young, I think postdoc at Cambridge University, who from all I know, you know, he's a very reasonable gentlemen who had been invited to speak at a conference on intelligence. And because of that, a bunch of folks decided to put together an open letter arguing that Cambridge University should not hire this guy. And so on. This is now become the, the standard way by which the baits are our resolve. You, you sign these open letters. So for had another guy on, and you should definitely check this, this guy out. His name is Alessandra through Mya. Uh, he is a, do you know this case? No, he's a physicist at the University of Pisa who is also a, who was a research scientist at cern, the, the nuclear research center in Geneva.

Speaker 5:          00:32:51       Uh, he was invited to speak at a gender and theoretical physics conference. Everything's about identity politics. And of course the narrative was going to be, you know, women are discriminated against in physics and you know, we need to help them, you know, improve their lot and physics and so on. So he got up and he presented Biblio metric data. So let me just, for your viewers explaining what that is, the ideal metric data is, is, uh, data that quantifies science. So, for example, if I want to know, uh, which disciplines sites, which other discipline, I will look at citation patterns across disciplines. Does economics and recite physics. That's physics ever sites, uh, economics, right? So biblio metric data is a way to parameterize science. And so what he did is he looked at for a given job in physics, if a woman gets a job versus if a man gets a job, how many citations did they have?

Speaker 5:          00:33:46       Citation is basically how many other people have cited your work when you published it. So you and I might have have published 50 papers each, but you've been cited 10,000 times. I've been cited 2000 times. Therefore your work is more influential even though we've both published the same amount of papers. And he, he showed through very objective data that for a given position, women were getting the jobs at much lower citations. While that was construed as terribly offensive, terribly sexist, you know, Nazi like, and so over 1600 scientists using the, the appellation particles for justice. I'm not making this up. What you can go to articles for just young Jamie can check it out yet and you can, you can read their letter and it includes, I think one or two of your former guests who, um, have become a very anti fan of anti fan, not antifa.

Speaker 5:          00:34:43       Uh, uh, because to me they're, they're sounding like intellectual cowers and fools. Who were these people? Uh, I think one of them is Sean Carroll. Uh, you know, that is, I think he's been on several times. Yeah. So he's on that list and I don't know, I don't want to misspeak, but I think maybe Neil, the grass dyson is on it, but maybe not. So that one, that one, I'll, I'll, I'll hold off on that one. But definitely Sean Carroll is on it because I've even tagged him and said, Hey, come on my show. That's discuss it. So the letter was basically, it starts off and it says, we will not tolerate that. Someone within our community, I'm, I'm paraphrasing, will question the humanity of anyone based on their race, their gender, their gender orientation. He did no such thing. All he did was report bibliometric data to either support the contention that women in physics were being discriminated against or not, that

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       should not yield a, an open letter. The chastises him and the way that they did. Now, the only thing that he did incorrectly and my view, and he's admitted to it, he came on my show recently. At one point during the presentation, he showed his biblio metric profile versus two other women that had gotten a job over him. So he personalized it. And, and in doing that, some people thought that that was inappropriate and that's fair. Maybe it's not a nice thing to do to present, you know, uh, your cv versus someone else and a public conference. Maybe we can discuss that, but the idea that we can't use bibliometrics objective scientific data to either prove or disprove a narrative is insane. And yet 1600 people decided to sign that letter. That does seem ridiculous, especially when it's an accusatory narrative. You're accusing people of sexual discrimination.

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       And then there's the scientific data shows otherwise. Exactly. But they're looking for a quality of outcome. Right? They're looking for an equal amount of female physicists and sal amount, that's you just, you're not going to get an equal amount of people interested in it. So then you, what you really have to show is you have to determine that there's been something that's holding those people back from achieving that goal. If there's some sort of a concerted effort to keep women out of that field, that's what should be demonstrated. And when you demonstrate that, I think here's the, here's the glass half full version of that. You're looking at that blue, blue bibliometric data. What that shows is that people are encouraging women to get into this, that it's the opposite, right? Instead of them being held back, they're actually, they're, they're looking to even out the playing field and help these women along.

Speaker 3:          00:37:21       The problem with that is then it makes it look like the women aren't as capable as the man, so not as effective as the men with their work. And you know, that's bad for everybody. That's bad for women and for men. It's bad for science because it makes it look like you're not being objective, which is what all we want. Every everyone who's not a scientist like myself. What I want more than anything is to know that you're, if you're a scientist, I want to know that what you're telling me is a fact. What I don't want is your own political spin on that fact because you don't want to be criticized at work by radical feminists are radical leftist or any people that might in some way potentially misconstrue your actions and your thoughts as being sexist or what are, fill in the blank, homophobic, transphobic, whatever, whatever the fuck it is that you're scared of. I don't want to hear that. What I want to hear is that you're looking at reality, right? There are brilliant women out there. There's brilliant men out there and a lot of those brilliant women choose not to do the same fields is brilliant men and as long as no one's holding them back, that shouldn't be a problem. The problem is got to be in someone being held back, someone discriminating, someone trying to keep you out and you, you're going to have to demonstrate, and I'm sure

Speaker 2:          00:38:35       that exists, I'm sure that exists. I'm sure there's women out there that are hearing this right now that have experienced all sorts of discrimination, sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, and they have their own personal stories. This is true, but that not is not necessarily why the data reflects that there's more men that are successful with this. It could seriously, this is, this is what people are really uncomfortable with. Seriously represented. There's differences in the sexist. Right, and I know that's so hard to breathe. Well, listen so hard from the first time. I think that I came on your show and I'd probably first discussed my, you know, evolutionary psychology research. I mean, it's a fundamental tenant of evolutionary theory that there are sexual dimorphism. When I appeared in front of the Canadian Senate, I had to sit there and lecture the senators that there is such a thing as male or female.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       But meanwhile, while many of them scoffed and laughed and tried to mock me, uh, it turns out a few days ago, there's now an elementary school. You're teaching young kids that boys to menstruate. So literally every, every satirical, every s I always joke, I always say that I have prophetic satire because every time I try to look for something that is so outlandish that it can enter into my, you know, satire, two months, three months, eight months later, it proves to be true. So for example, at one point I argued that I wanted to compete, uh, in the octogenarian under 120 pounds category in the judo. Cause you identify first because I that the final 80, 20 pounds also, I'm trans gravity. I, I set the my weight at whatever, my weakness, therefore, and then because I can change my identity on a daily basis because Harvard University thought us that, uh, I'm later going to fight.

Speaker 2:          00:40:19       And the under 18 year old category hold on, Harvard allows you to change it on a daily basis. Harvard University came out that's actually discussed this in my Canadian Senate testimony. Harvard University's Lgbtq, uh, a plus a plus. The stars are infinite to the Hashtag [inaudible]. Exactly. They came out with a pamphlet that said not only can we change, you know, our, our, our gender identity, but it can fluctuate on a daily basis. Right. So I could be he, she [inaudible] Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. And so I took this idea and I said, well I, I identify as an 80 year old under 120 pound Monday, but then I'm going to fight in the judo competition. I use Judah because my brother was an Olympian in judo. As you, I think we might've discussed, I'm going to fight and the under eight category on Tuesday because I self identify on Tuesday as being a child.

Speaker 2:          00:41:14       Now it sounds satirical and insane. A Dutch gentlemen who's 69 years old. Did you know this case? That's trans ageism. He just said he decided that he identifies with someone 20 years younger and he wants to use it on dating apps once it changes. Exactly. And then that would change his pension thing one the ones. So, so then, then I introduce a new term and then that proved to be prophetically satirical. Uh, I coined a new condition called transgenderism by proxy. So, so if, if, if, if you're watching now enjoy this, uh, if joe and Gad have sex, if I self identify you as a woman, then I'm engaging in heterosexual sex. So it's not about me self identify me. Yeah, I can change my identity exactly. In your own interpretations of exactly. So it's not, it's not that my self identity changes into a woman that the guy that I'm having sex with, I self identify as a female.

Speaker 2:          00:42:14       Ah, well, a few weeks, maybe not even a few weeks later, some trans activists on twitter came out and said, ew, disgusting. Transphobes just because you have a excuse the term a dick in your mouth doesn't mean that that's a dick. If it's a woman. And I called this trans, uh, uh, cunnilingus wait a minute, wait a minute. It doesn't mean it's a dick if that person is a woman. So just because you have a dick in your mouth, it doesn't mean it's a deck because that's a woman. You are giving sex to a woman. Do you know? Yeah, there's a nine inch penis in your, in your thing, but it's a vagina. Yale put, they put tampons in the men's room. Yes sir. Of course. I know that. Not only women, of course I did last year. That's my, that's my daily life. That's called Tuesday for me, man. I said, I have a hard time getting that out because I'm like, what?

Speaker 2:          00:43:07       Women are the only ones who menstruate. What? Yes they are. Yes they are. God Damn it. Boys can cannot periods to children to be taught the latest victory for trend. There you go. I love how they say that. The latest victory. That's right. Latest victory for who wrote that story? Who wrote that? Vox. Who? Halena. Hey, Halena fuck off. That's not a victory. That's nonsense. That is God damn nonsense, but can I tell you what is that victory? That's crazy. Kids. Kids don't know if you want to tell kids that sometimes people are born in the wrong bodies. That seems to be true. There seems to be real evidence to that in terms of the way the brain works. Sure. I mean you, if you want to call it the problem is distinguishing it from normalcy in a way that makes it look inferior. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:43:59       Right. Isn't that the real problem? So if someone has this condition, they shouldn't feel inferior and you shouldn't be bigoted towards them and they shouldn't live a being exposed to any discrimination. But we shouldn't change our understanding of reality to celebrate your unique personhood. Exactly. And incidentally, one of the things I talk about in the book, all of these idea pathogens, I argue some of them come from really noble places. I swing so as well. Yeah. So let's cover a few of these. So for example, the empty slate premise, Tabula Rasa, we're with empty minds, is a profoundly idiotic position. But it really stems from the noble hopeful position that if we're all born with equal potentiality, we can all reach the same end trajectory. If only the environment were conducive for us being top athletes, top scientists, top mathematicians, then we would have reached it.

Speaker 2:          00:44:51       There is nothing inherently at the start at t equals zero that differentiate any of us. Now, that's an insanely stupid and wrong, but it is a hopeful message. Now, extend this to other contexts, right? Uh, it shouldn't be that you're defined by your biological sex. You could change it in any way you want. That sounds very liberating, right? So I think a lot of these idea pathogens, what I call these, these parasitic ideas, really come from a notion of trying to liberate people from otherwise they're the shackles of reality. So it's insane. Yeah. It's a form of, of delusional thinking. But that is rooted. It's genesis comes from a good place. I couldn't agree with that. More and gender dysphoria used to be considered used to be considered a mental disorder. Right? But isn't it right? Well, listen, but what is it? Okay, let, but let's be honest, if it's not, if it's, is it a physical disorder?

Speaker 2:          00:45:50       What is it? I'll put it in a very charitable politically, correctly. It's certainly not part of the default value of human expressions. Do you see what I'm saying? Male and female is the default values. We are a sexually dimorphic species now for all sorts of reasons until genetic developmental reasons. When the brain is getting typed in Utero, things can happen that altered those default values. Now you come out with gender dysphoria, you shouldn't be discriminated against. You should be treated with complete respect. You should be free of bigotry. That Greg doesn't mean that there is a spectrum of possibilities of which that one is one of the default values. It's simply isn't. It's wrong to argue that, but in the same way that feminists like to argue that there are no innate sex differences because that they think would help alter the sexist status quo.

Speaker 2:          00:46:42       This is what's happening with Trans Activism. That's why they are consequentialist when it comes to truth, screw truth, screw reality, screw biological common sense in the pursuit of freeing the world of bigotry, you should be able to free the world of bootcut bigotry without constantly attacking truth. Well, and here's the other question. If it is not, this is what I was getting at. If it is, if it's not a mental disorder, what is, is it a physical disorder? Is it a disorder? And if it's not a disorder, why must it be treated medically? Why must it be gender reassignment surgery? Why must there be exogenous hormones introduced into the body wise? All that happening it rhetorical question or, or are you asking me? Just

Speaker 4:          00:47:30       walk up to them. I mean it's kind of rhetorical. There's no one here, but if it's not a disorder, then why are these gender reassignment is physicians here? If you, if you don't have to have a sex change to be a woman. If you're a woman with a big Dick and broad shoulders and a big hairy chest, but you're a woman, right? Well what is the need for the doctor then? If you're already a woman, if we decided that you're a woman, so you just want to change your appearance to outwardly match how you feel.

Speaker 5:          00:48:01       Well that seems a disorder. Well, right there. I wonder, I'm, I'm not sure so I don't want to misspeak, but I wonder if, I think in the DSM five gender dysphoria is listed as a condition. Is that, is that correct? It is

Speaker 4:          00:48:13       it as a condition, but it's not accepted by that in terms of like public perception and certainly in terms of trans activists or lbgt activists or anybody who talks about these things in a progressive way that is of taboo. Like the actual medical nomenclature that's used to describe those conditions is taboo.

Speaker 5:          00:48:33       Well, there's, I don't know if you heard about this case. There was a physician research scientists at Brown University who published a paper, very serious data, scientific data. I think her name is Lisa Lynn or Lipo, I can't remember her name. It was published I think in a plus one, you know, very serious scientific journal where she looked at the social contagion. You don't talking about, you know, of uh, sort of transgenderism. How, if, you know, there definitely seems to beat well, well, literally that social contagion effect. Now that paper was published, Brown had advertised it. Uh, it was published in a top Peer Review Journal while the Trans activists came after that paper and brown the side to at least pull it off of it's sort of promotional platform. Uh, I reached out actually to to, I think her name is Lisa to get her on the show, but as you might imagine she was a bit tested. She's probably shell shocked. She shall shot. So I'm not sure if she'll come, but again, here's a serious person who probably is as liberal. She's a, she's a physician who deals with these issues who are simply talking about the fact that there's definitely a social contagion effect that is taking place. She's a Nazi. Yeah, there's people just

Speaker 4:          00:49:51       really, really crazy when it comes to gender. That seems to be the battle ground, the battle ground between logic and science. It rests and gender. And I had this conversation with a friend of mine about the the gender pay gap and he was arguing it as if it was a thing where there was a man and a woman working right next to each other doing the same job and the woman was making 78 cents. The matters making a dollar and he's a smart guy and I had to explain to him, I said, this is not the case. I go there, they're doing different jobs, they're working different hours. I go, you're, you're spitting out propaganda as

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       if it's true. And he was reluctant to believe me. He was like, are you serious? He leary said this. He goes, I'm going to be very upset if I find out that you're, you're, you're lying to me. I go, but I'm lying to you. I go, this is adorable. You're, you're going to be, you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about and you're going to be upset if you find out that online, I'm going to be upset if you don't fucking apologize to me when I show you this. So I know he did not. I sent him the information. I sent him many articles on it and I sent him many critiques of the way. Even the president of the United States was discussing this because they're doing it in a very politically correct way. That is actually disingenuous. I showed him the actual raw data that shows that men work an average of, I forget what the percentage is, more hours that they, they're more likely to die on the job.

Speaker 3:          00:51:15       They pick more risky jobs. It's a totally different thing. This is not discounting actual sexual discrimination at work, which I'm sure exists, but this is not, when you're looking at the raw data, which is what they're trying to say, the 78 cents to a dollar. They're saying this is just systemic sexism across the board. There's no other explanation for it, so I showed him know there is other explanations for them. It's different jobs. It's working different hours. It's, there's probably a bunch of factors. Testosterone making you more aggressive, making you more risk averse, more a risk taker, risk taking. There's all sorts of different factors. His response was sometimes the perception of something is as important as the facts. I'm like, you mother Fucker, I'm going to come to your house and smack you in the face in front of your woman. Yeah, but it's, it's interesting that you say this because what you are trying to do there is use information.

Speaker 3:          00:52:06       Hopefully it's tsunami of information to get them to move away from is anchored position, which is something that I discussed in great detail in my book and I think I've come to a similar realization to you regrettably, and that that is that oftentimes all the information, the world is not going to help. It's not going to help. He didn't want to lose, he didn't want to lose, and it really is, you're putting your hands in your la, la, la or he was trying to find a way to say by him saying that perception is sometimes more important than the actual facts. He was trying to say that he was trying to say that women are discriminated against because these facts are paraded around in a way that make women feel bad. Right. And because women feel bad that they're making 78 cents to the man's dollar, the is just as important as the actual reality of how much they make.

Speaker 3:          00:52:54       Am I, God dammit, this is, you just spun a web, you spun a bullshit web and your, your legs are all trapped up in it. You can't go anywhere now. Well it speaks to another thing that I discussed in the book. Are you familiar with poppers? Falsification, principle? No. So Kaupapa Papa was a philosopher of science as a general rule, I hate to read most philosophers because they engage in a lot of highfalutin bullshit that really doesn't get us anywhere. But philosophers of science actually are quite helpful and that they really help us understand the epistemology of how to learn about knowledge, create knowledge test. And so Karl

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       popper argued that if you really want to test a theory, you have to be able to falsify the theory that which cannot be falsified cannot be considered a scientific theory. Right? If the observation is this way, it supports the theory of the observation is this way at falsifies authority. So, for example, fate is not a scientific theory, right? Because if I step out of my house today and the truck hits me, it was my faith. If I step out of my house and the truck doesn't hit me, it was my faith. So there are no conditions of the world where whatever is instantiated is not my faith. Therefore, fatalism is not part of the epidemiology of science. Right? Well, so to speak to that point that we were talking about earlier, how when someone is anchored in a position, you can get them away from it.

Speaker 5:          00:54:09       So I talk and I have a section of my book that is currently titled All Roads Lead to bigotry. All right, so let me give you an example. A few examples of these. If you say that you don't want to have sex with overweight women, grossly overweight women, 500 pound women, then the argument is you're a fattest, right? You are judging us based on the folds of our skin and you're dehumanizing us. If you are someone who is specifically looking to have sex with someone who is overweight, you are fetishizing our skin folds. So if I love having sex with a fat woman, I'm a bad person. If I don't want to have sex with a fat woman and a bad person. And I demonstrate through many of these examples how all roads lead to victimhood. Right? I give the example, I think the last time I was on the show of a woman who had done a study demonstrating that uh, uh, soldiers, Israeli soldiers had never raped a Palestinian woman.

Speaker 5:          00:55:06       Do you remember that case? Now she was, she had done the study hoping to show that there was rampant rape of Palestinian women. She couldn't uncover a single documented case of about senior woman being raped by IDF soldiers, Israeli Defense Forces, soldiers. What did you conclude from that? Well, the IDF soldiers are so racist that they demonize these women so much that they're not even worthy of being raped. So if you rape the Palestinian women, you're an evil Jew. If you don't rape any of the Palestinian women, you're an evil Jew. And so through all of these examples, I demonstrate that all states of the world lead to you being a bigot. And that if you like fails poppers, falsification, principal. Because I snapped. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:55:51       Except the state of not choosing it all. Meaning meaning if you like if you don't choose between a fat woman or if you don't love a fat woman or you don't not want to have sex with a fat one, you just have sex with anyone who wants to have sex with you. Right? Like that's the equal outcome. I mean, essentially that's what they're looking for, right? Because if you don't choose, but what's really interesting about people is if someone doesn't have your principals ideologically, you're allowed to shit on them and body shamed them. Like how many people called

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       trump disgusting and made fun of his little hands and how many liberals leftwing people's talking about how much much he had. Must obviously have a little dick. Right, right, right. It's like, yeah, it's horseshit. Yeah. I mean, hypocrisy is across both aisles, right? Yeah. Speaking of which, uh, I don't know if you want to get into this at all, but, uh, what did you think, I know it's a bit old news now, but, uh, what'd you think of some of our common friends? His response to the threat cavenaugh situation? Our common friends responses. Some of, some of our common friends, I thought the not respond well. They did not follow at the, into logical ethos as far as I'm concerned. Like, so for example, so for example, the presumption of innocence and it should be something that is so profoundly a nonstarter in terms of ever violating that, that tenant that to the extent that we didn't come infinitely close to establishing that he was guilty of anything, it's a nonstarter that you don't, there's no repercussions that should be fall him and yet many folks that both of us know, we're not of that opinion.

Speaker 2:          00:57:33       So for example, one of the, one of our friends thought that, well this wasn't a criminal case, this was a job interview. And so we don't need to reach the same exact thing, level of evidence, evidence to determine for him to be potentially guilty. I thought that was grotesque. Who said that? Uh, his name rhymes with Sham Paris?

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       Well, I think people were rightly concerned about Cavanaugh's ideology in terms of his record on privacy. Uh, his promotion of the Patriot Act. There was a bunch of issues that people had real concern. Those seem to go away while this was all going on, which is really confusing to me. Like there's real reasons to be concerned about this guy. A Jordan Jordan said, put out a tweet and I might've been the first one to two a critique and firth, uh, where he said, if cavenaugh is confirmed, he should step down. I thought that that was insane. Why? Why did he say, he said, well, you know, subsequently he said, oh, it was a thought experiment and no, there's no thought experiment, right? I mean there was, I mean any sane person would think that someone coming out 36 years after the fact, five minutes before there's going to be the vault saying well somewhere somehow someplace. Not sure he may have been the one is not going to pass. She was saying he may have been the one she was saying he was the one and she was saying that he covered her mouth and then he was trying to get her pants off, but she was wearing a one piece swimsuit. Yeah, I read into it. Um, I don't know what happened. That's the fundamental problem and no one knows happened other than

Speaker 4:          00:59:22       her and him and both of them are dealing with 36 year old memory.

Speaker 5:          00:59:26       But I'm saying right here, I've already said this on my show. I remember, I think it was in 1983 I was at some summer camp and Hillary Clinton took me to the side and had my way. Pretty sure it was 1983 maybe in 1984 she had her way with you. Sure. Yeah. I'm pretty sure it was hillary. Pretty sure pro-kindness strong comp. Kind of confident it was her. Yeah. Look, Elizabeth Loftus, who is someone that I know well who's a professor at Uc Irvine, who is the preeminent researcher on memory and eye witness testimony. Uh, as someone who has demonstrated through many, many decades of research that our memory is unbelievably inaccurate, unbelievably out. Our ability to remember sort of, to identify someone in I testimony four weeks ago is unbelievably suspect, let alone 36 years ago. That's true. So where was the science pause?

Speaker 4:          01:00:25       Let me pause right there. Because there are traumatic events that you can remember very well, particularly if someone tries to assault you or something happens to you that gets seared into your brain. That's a fact. I mean, I remember a, I remember being beat up when I was seven, right? I remember being humiliated. My stepdad and mom wasn't really beat up my kid. He'll hit me like once or twice or something like that, but I didn't do anything about it. I froze and I remember my stepdad came and rescued me. I remember that. I don't remember all the details, but I do remember that I felt humiliated and that I lost and I do remember that my Stepdad had a rescue me. I remember that. Right. Like you can remember stuff from 36 years ago is it is possible. But the problem with this story is that they were drinking, they were underage, they were really young.

Speaker 4:          01:01:15       Okay, so you're dealing with all these factors. There was some sort of interaction physically, you know, was she somewhat willing? Was she someone into him? Was she completely resistant to it? I don't know. She doesn't know. He doesn't know. But there's no demonstrated pattern of him doing awful things. And then on top of that, there was a couple, at least two people that had completely fraudulent claims that came out and they were ideologically, ideologically opposed to him. So they had concocted these stories that turned out to fall apart. Here's my feeling on that. If someone does that intentionally, they should receive the same kind of punishment. I could not agree with you more. Someone would get if they were convicted of those acts. Here's an article on this. Actually the trips, if you, if you falsely accuse someone of rape, intentionally falsely accuse someone of rape, you are literally subjecting them to the punishment of rape. What if the prosecution goes through would have that person winds up getting incarcerated,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       locked in a cage, separated from their family, kids taken away their ability to earn a living. You should be treated the same way you were trying to get them to be treated. I think it is almost an equal act to rape itself. You know, I, and I hope I almost, I hope not, doesn't have physical violence. I'm going to go further than you. Maybe it's going to get me into trouble. I almost would argue that it is more diabolical because the rapist does a horrific act on you once every single morning that you wake up as a false accuser knowing that you have put this person in prison and you go about your day. You're engaging in this form of rape if you'd like. So I would disagree with that because I think if you rape someone, that person who got raped has to deal with that.

Speaker 2:          01:03:02       The real pain of being physically violated. He was in prison for 25 years and getting raped by seven guys. Guys got to learn how to fight. Come in and on your butt. Cheeks closed and keep moving by the way are awful. I think the rapist is far more awful cause it's physically doing something. I had a guy on my show, maybe, you know, I've had maybe not as many people as you have, but I've had quite a few amazing people on my show. One of the most poignant ones was a gentleman that I invited and I was lucky that he accepted my invitation was his, I think his name is David Mccallum. Mccallum. Uh, sort of maybe last January he had jeff, he had been released from I think almost three decades in prison for a murder that came up that it wasn't him who did it.

Speaker 2:          01:03:47       Now the reason why I invited him, uh, more than just because it's an incredible story, is that I had seen his response to the unimaginable injustice that he had gone through. I think he went in when he was 17 and now he was in his late forties and he had such grace, such lack of anger. I mean it literally was, he was Buddha. And so I thought how powerful it would be to have this person come on my show if only to tap into this unbelievable ability. I mean, and I told them, I think on the show that if it were me, I would be so eaten up by anger, by a sense of revenge. I want to burn that the whole planet down. Uh, anyways, this is a great guy. You should, you should definitely check him out. He's written a book about it.

Speaker 2:          01:04:34       It's pretty amazing story. Yeah. False accusations are awful. And, and, and people who are people who lie to try to punish someone who didn't do anything. That's an awful crime and I think it should be equal in punishment to the crime that you are falsely accusing someone of doing. I really do. I think that's the only way to stop it. The real problem is with false rape accusations is that there's very little punishment at all that happens to the women for the most part, or the men, men who accused men of falsely raping them. There's very, very little happening. Why? Why do you think that is? I don't know. I don't understand. I don't understand why people don't think about it as the horrific thing that it actually is. I think it's partly because people are

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       of doubting someone who has been raped. If you, one of the more horrific things you could do is like imagine if you had been raped and then you told your story and I came along and I have no knowledge of the actual event and I come along and I go ups, God's a liar. This is bullshit. It never happened. Nothing happened to him. He's just a baby. He just wants attention. So he's running around here. He was wearing a short skirt and he went out that night and you know, and that's, that is something that does happen. So I think that is so disgusting. Someone who doubts someone who has actually been a victim, that people are scared of that. And then also there's the kid gloves approach. We don't treat women accusing men of things the same way we accused women accused, uh, you know, uh, men accusing women of things.

Speaker 4:          01:06:09       Men accusing women are things where if a man accuses a woman of violence, what you, okay, dude, you're going to be fine. If a woman beats up her husband, which does happen. I mean, I know a guy, he's girlfriend used to punch the shit out of him and, and I was like, Bro, you got to get out like you are, you're literally being a beauty. You're, you're dumb being domestically abused and no one's even going to care. Right? Do you understand? Like you gotta get out of this relationship because look, if you were hitting her, if a man is hitting a woman, then I'm locked that motherfucker up. That's how I feel. And I'm sure that's how you feel too. That guy's a piece of shit. But if a woman hits a man, I'm like, just keep your hands up, man. Don't let her hit.

Speaker 4:          01:06:45       Yeah, I just, but this is from me. A man whose friend was murdered by his wife. One of my good friends. Oh, Phil Hartman. Oh, was martyred by his wife. So dumb. And this is a woman who was always insulting him, always like publicly humiliating. Saw this during that. Saw her publicly humiliated, insult him. I saw it many times. She's a very angry person. She had a cocaine problem. She was also on Zoloft. They want some sort of a settlement with zoloft. The family did because she was doing cocaine and Zoloft at the same time and it's known to have a psychotic reaction, but she shot him in his fucking sleep, man. I mean, women do commit violence. It's not as common, but it's still gross. It's still an egregious crime. But good luck trying to go to get someone locked up for it. Wow. Good luck getting anybody to be sympathetic.

Speaker 4:          01:07:35       Even me. Did you ever, I mean, not that I have your, well, I met your wife. She's a lovely woman. I've, she kicked your ass. I'll probably be on her side. You're probably wondering how is someone still gorgeous? Has her choose me. You're thinking that lovely man. I love you. Gotta here. Thank you buddy. I want it to actually share with you and I was, I was hoping to only discuss this for you to only see it in the book, but I can't you open me up, Joe Rogan. I can't help my chair. So, uh, I came close to probably being a victim of some very serious, I've never been sexually abused or anything, but I think I escaped one narrowly, uh, when I was a child and Lebanon. Oh Geez. So this was during

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       the civil war. This is all discussed in the intro to my forthcoming book. Uh, it was during the height of the, I mean the start of the civil war where nobody would leave the house. I mean, everybody's being butchered, left, right, and center. We're trying to leave Lebanon for obvious reasons. Uh, my father had been stuck out of the country. He couldn't get back into Lebanon. Uh, it was myself, my mother, uh, I believe my sister was there and a male friend of ours who was stuck at our house. And in the middle of the night, there's a knock on our door. Now, this is in the middle of the most brutal civil war you could imagine. So if somebody knocks at your door, it's usually not a good thing. And the, I go to the door to answer. Speaking about remembering, you were saying earlier, this is, I'm 11 years old, uh, or at least at the cusp of turning 11, uh, I get to the door.

Speaker 5:          01:09:07       Who is this? Uh, and the gentleman says it's me. I can't remember if his name was Mohammed, one of the two. He says, it's so, and so who's this? Now? At the time in Lebanon, in our kitchen we had, do you remember how in restaurants in the old days you'd have these in the bathrooms, you'd have these sort of towels that you could use to wipe your hands? Not, not, not disposable, actual cloth towels. So we had a service where this gentleman with com and in our kitchen, we had one of these days, he would pick them up, launder them, and then bring them back. So this gentleman who that's our only relationship with him, knocks at our door with some other guys and says, hey, open the door now. This is in the middle of the civil war knife. At that moment, I opened that door.

Speaker 5:          01:09:55       If I don't have the instinct to go call my mother, I don't know what the trajectory would be. So I go to get my mother and now the guys growing more insistent, we call anyways. There's a whole interaction that takes place, but we refuse to open the door for him. At the time, there was still some sort of police presence in Lebanon. The unit used to be called 16 and Arabic, the number 16 maybe for the precinct or whatever. We called them up, they come over, the guy comes in and the, the policeman says to him, what are you doing here? Knocking on these people's door in the middle of the civil war? He says, oh, we went up to the mountains. We brought some pomegranates for them. And so the police man looks at him and says, you don't know these people other than changing their towel.

Speaker 5:          01:10:40       And the middle of this brutal civil war. You're coming here to give them these fruits. If I ever catch you here again, you know, whatever. And then the guy looks at us and says, I'll be back for you. Or something. That, and within a week or two, I can remember the exact time period we had left. Now I'm almost certain, I don't know, I'm surmising, but I'm almost certain that this guy with his buddies was coming over, not because he wanted to share a coffee and, uh, you know, cookies. And my feeling is some bad

Speaker 2:          01:11:14       stuff would've happened that night. But through the grace of the cosmos, we were protected. So, because I've, I've often been asked what was the scariest moment you had in the civil war? And there were many, many, many things that I saw, but nothing scared me as much as that interaction because I sort of pretty much knew what was in store for us. Dehumanizing that happens during war leads to all sorts of horrific acts. Yeah. It's disgusting and scary. Yeah. Uh, you, uh, you probably dodged a bullet. I relate to dodge a bullet and we're so fortunate to have left. I've actually been asked to go back to Lebanon many times, and at this point by, you know, some pretty prominent people, big politicians and so on. And I really have a mental block. I even get Lebanese folks saying, listen, we, we know people who will protect you and so on.

Speaker 2:          01:12:01       I too. Do you live in Canada? And now it's one of the greatest countries of the world's ever known. Why? Go back. Yeah. Fuck that. You guys come to me and visit Toronto. The Fuck Outta here. Toronto's amazing. He likes it. I love it. That's one of my favorite cities. You know, one of the things I love about it, it's like a big city, but the people are friendly. Like it's a small town. Right? I don't know how the hell you guys pulled that off. We were just good people. Do you feel, do you feel a difference between Montreal and Toronto? Because Toronto better. Sorry, Montreal. You heard me, Bill? I do. I like why? What is it that you don't like about me? I do love Montreal. Montreal. Um, it is, uh, the conflict, like the French English. Yeah. That conflict seems to me ridiculous. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:12:48       The, the idea that you're gonna succeed. Yeah. Good luck. Get you're going to leave Canada. Okay. Congratulations. Going to be your own country that nobody goes to. Right. You're going to make everybody speak French. That's so stupid. And they made, they put French signs everywhere. I get, they're trying to like cling onto their culture. I get it. And the culture is wonderful. The food's fantastic. There's great people. Montreal, beautiful women. Yeah, they're beautiful. I Love Montreal, but I love Toronto more. Sorry. Incidentally, I learned French before I did English on a more francophone through, through history. And I fully agree with you about this to put it through the French protection. So I, I, I was, yeah, I was invited once. This was probably in the late nineties. I had been a professor a few years. I was invited by, uh, one of the big business schools in Montreal, h e c, uh, which is a French acronym.

Speaker 2:          01:13:37       I had been invited to give a talk there. Uh, they were interested in potentially making me an offer. And so I said, are you, I'm assuming I'm getting my talking in English, right? Because I mean, my whole scientific career has been in English, even though I'm fluent in French. He said, no, no, no, we'd really like you to give it in French. And I thought that that was so, uh, pay czar parochially it was so small minded. Right. I mean, I mean, you don't see Israeli people saying, hey, how can we not doing this in Hebrew? You don't see the Japanese saying, why isn't this happening in Japanese? Right. The two groups that I see doing this are the Germans

Speaker 3:          01:14:12       and the French. Uh, but whether it be in Quebec or in France, and I think it's in part because they don't accept that they're no longer the big bully of the world. Right. The positive side would be that they're just celebrating this language. Yeah. They appreciate their heritage. But you shouldn't be protecting your heritage through draconian means. Correct. So when you have language police going around measuring whether the French sign is bigger than the English one, you're getting stuck in the weeds, right? Yeah. That is a weird one that they do. But it's such a beautiful city and the people were really nice there too. And they're hardy people in Montreal and people in Toronto, they're hardy folk because the winter, I think it might, yeah, you got to deal with shit. You got to deal with adversity over there. But it's interesting in that there's so much nicer than the people that deal with the adversity in the cold climates in, in America.

Speaker 3:          01:15:03       There's something about the United States when you deal with the cold climate, people are mean. Yeah. I've been asked, and I don't think I had an answer, maybe. I think it was rubin who asked me, why do you think that many of the sort of people on the forefront of the, you know, freedom of speech, you know, debate all stem from Canada and I don't think I had a good reason. Do you have any, any thoughts as to why is it just a freedom of speech laws? Right. That's one of the reasons that it does not have a first amendment. So Canada is not have the same. What we have here in the United States is fucking beautiful. It's one of the only places on earth where it is literally a part of our law that you should be able to express yourself freely, right? And that this ethic is something that permeates our culture.

Speaker 3:          01:15:54       It permeates our identity. It's something that we all cling to. Freedom of speech. This is a very important, and this is one of the reasons why we get so stunned when we see censorship and when we see censorship that's, it just doesn't make any sense. It's not justified. Um, what you guys have over there is a much more slippery slope. Human rights councils and all that weirdness that we've seen time and time again with people getting fined for jokes. You know what I mean? There's, there's a lot of like very, very weird stuff that you guys have to deal with up there because you simply don't have a first amendment and showing you thing that, that, that causes more people to come out of Canada defending freedom of speech business because you realize how important it is and you're right next to us. Right? You're right. We're all spouting off at the mouth and fucking shooting nuclear bombs into the atmosphere. I mean, w you're living next to a bunch of fucking wild hillbillies. This is what it's like. This one. It's like if you live in, in Canada and you're living next to the United States, like what are those fucking crazy assholes doing? But at least those crazy ass goals can say whatever they want. Right. You know, I mean, who knows if this podcast would be even possible in Canada, I don't know. I, we could have gotten

Speaker 5:          01:17:10       in trouble for some of the things that we've said along the way. It's entirely likely. Right. Speaking of, cause you, you mentioned the human rights tribunal. I think at one point, uh, I discussed on the show the indigenous woman who are youth, that she should get tenure despite not having published anything. Do you, do you know that story? Don't let me, let me, let me restate that story or, or, or maybe state it for the first time because it relates to something bigger than I'd like to discuss in the Canadian context. So there's this now push and Canadian universities to have what's called to indigenize the universities. Okay. And to indigenize means many things. So in one case, the case that I just mentioned briefly before, you had a professor in the law faculty at the University of British Columbia who was an indigenous woman who had not published much, if anything, and had got, had been given every single opportunity, you know, extensions on her tenure clock and so on.

Speaker 5:          01:18:09       And then finally, when she didn't get 10 years, she filed a complaint with the British Columbia at human rights tribunal arguing that her tradition is an oral one. And therefore by forcing her to write things down, you know, as a, as an academic was unbelievable. So saying her tradition is being on land and you shouldn't be forcing her to swim in a swimming event. Exactly right. But by the way, Judaism is based also on oral traditions. So by that logic, all those Jewish scientists who won Nobel prizes, but the more nefarious manifestation of indigenization while they are two other instances, one annoying but not so serious. And one I think very serious, the annoying but not so serious is where now at every single event and Kat and Canadian University, let's say you're giving out diplomas, you have to first sell flagellate uh, at an apologize for sitting on stolen land, right?

Speaker 5:          01:19:09       So here are students who have spent years getting their degrees. This is their moment to shine. This is about them. But you have to first hear about why we're all evil because we're franchise transgressing on native land. That's one example. The more serious example is where it is no longer appropriate to say that the scientific method is the way of knowing that there are alternate ways of knowing that are just as valid. And what are those? So, for example, in that the indigenous way of knowing, uh, now I've argued that when it comes to content specific knowledge, for example, if you're going to study something and the deep north where the inuits have lived for thousands of years, they're going to have local knowledge about the flora, about the fauna. That is truly a valuable, that is in fact scientific knowledge. But exactly. That's exactly what, but, but we, but I'm saying

Speaker 3:          01:20:07       that's what I'm saying. It's content specific. Right. Okay. We should be appreciative of that knowledge and listened to it. But that doesn't mean that speaks to your point that it is outside the purview of the scientific method. There is no epis thermology that there is no Lebanese Jewish way of knowing. There is no Joe Rogan way of knowing there isn't any transgender way of knowing this information. It's just the scientific method. That's the only game in town. While they're arguing that, no, there are ways of not just like the Hashtag science must fall. I mentioned this on, on the Ruben report to Jennifer [inaudible] Hashtag [inaudible] yeah, this is what's going to rise. They're called, they're called lists. Actually, this is, this came out of the University of Cape Town, one of the top universities in South Africa where the students were arguing that it is ridiculous that we only abide by the scientific method.

Speaker 3:          01:21:03       There are all sorts of other Booga Booga ways of knowing that are just, I mean, I'm using [inaudible], but you know what I mean? Right. You could dance and make the rain come down, you know, whatever. I mean it like spiritual shamanism, ways of knowing that are, that are outside the purview of the scientific method. And that is grotesque. And so one of the things that I argue probably doesn't make me a lot of friends at the university is that there is no indigenous way of knowing. Please Google Hashtag science must fall. I need to remember those. A a website for know your meme and I got the video of where it starts. There you go, doctor. Sad proves to be true again. I have a feeling this is a fortune thing. It's real. It's real. Two or three years old. There you go. Let's make that larger.

Speaker 3:          01:21:47       Some my shitty eyes could read it. Science must falls a Hashtag mocking a movement to abolish the science. Oh, it's marking. No, but the original idea is that you should decolonize your mind. I understand, but it's mocking that movement marking a movement to abolish the scientific method and replace it with a new understanding of scientific inquiry. This movement was started by a group of students known as follows, at the University of Cape Town who want to decolonize science from western modernity as it, an offshoot of the ongoing fees must fall movement protesting increases in university tuition. That's one thing. Canada, I going for it too. Yeah. That you guys have nash tuition. Yeah. Way Lower health care and, and student. We pay for it with taxes, right? Yeah. But it's worth it. I mean, I've said time and time, I believe in a hybrid form of, of governing in a hybrid form of, of culture.

Speaker 3:          01:22:41       And I think that, um, I've supported a lot of socialized ideas. Sure. And one of the reasons why is because I see socialism work with the fire department, with the police department, with, with things that we all agreed that we're going to chip in and pay for, and the fact that we don't do this with healthcare, that you know, if my neighbor gets sick, the community has to chip and Goddammit, that guys have been paying taxes his whole life. He's a viable part of the community. We should be taking care of our own. This should be a primary thing like this to strengthen our community, to strengthen our civilization. One of the primary things is you. We should be taking care of each other physically, right? It should be like above all right? Education. You shouldn't have to fucking be in debt. A quarter million dollars if you get a fucking education.

Speaker 3:          01:23:27       Don't we want less losers? Don't we want more people to have education? Don't we mom? More people to have some sort of pathway to success. Wouldn't that just logically lead to a stronger economy, a stronger communities, stronger civilization, wouldn't it? It wasn't that logical. Let me give a devil's advocate advocate answer to the extent that there are now no longer any barriers to entry to get into university, certainly in Cam, that he's not a financial one. You get, I think a misallocation of talent and resources where everybody feels compelled to go to university, where in reality many of the folks in question, and believe me, I'm the last guy to argue against education, right? I'm, I'm all about lifelong learning, but it doesn't have to be through the formal channels of getting a degree. Right? But it's not compulsory. I, well it is compulsory unofficially in that it is now no longer acceptable to not have at least some entry level the Gri.

Speaker 3:          01:24:25       Well then we should concentrate on that as an issue. Right? Okay. That should be the issue. Not this idea that somehow or another education should be expensive. So it should be difficult. So it should be something that's only sought out by people deserve a fair enough that sort. So I agree it should. The barrier to entry shouldn't be that, you know, it's the finances that don't allow you to pursue your interests. But I know, I mean, just as a professor for 25 years now, there are students that I see very early and in a given semester that I know they're not there. They're insurance or they're not there for intrinsic reasons. They just don't have the sparkle in the eyes and no amount of coaxing on my part is ever going to bring them out. I mean, I try, I think everybody's redeemable, but you can tell that they're there because they don't have it.

Speaker 3:          01:25:09       Maybe those people would have had a much more lucrative trajectory where they pursue trade school. Uh, so, so I think we have to also be careful about how to allocate the talent that we have. I know that that absolutely makes sense and I think that is most likely played out over the difficulty of pursuing an education. Right? Just like it is with everything else, every, everything else, like whatever, whatever you try. If you want to be a standup comedian, it's not everybody gets to do Carnegie Hall. Like there's, there's uh, there's a weeding out process of the difficulty of achieving success. And there's a lot of people that fall by the wayside and don't make it. And this is just natural. It's a natural part of the process. But if you say not everybody is a comedian, that's true, but open mike nights available to everybody. True. And that's why there's so many comedians that actually are good because they do find it through because there's no financial barrier to entry. If it costs,

Speaker 4:          01:26:05       you know, $35,000 a year to pursue an education in comedy and you had to be $200,000 in debt before he could make a living on the road, right. There wouldn't be a God damn thing. The laugh at there, wouldn't it be none of us, right? There'd be zero of us. And that's not a good x. It's a not a good example because obviously comedy is one of the rare things that is a self educated process. You have to yourself self taught. There's no other way, right? You just have to pursue it. But I think there's the rigidness of university studies, you know, the, the rigidness of courses of, of determining what people should and shouldn't learn what they should and shouldn't be educated in who you know. And also the, the randomness of the professors that you get. Like you could get you and get a wonderful education I'm sure. Or you can get some dip shit and get taught about, you know, how gender is a social construct and you know, and you're sitting in class all baffled looking at your penis going, what have you done to me? Fucking monster.

Speaker 5:          01:27:03       You know, it's, I'm at the point now in my career, am I as a professor where I'm facing a bit of a fork and that I remain as passionate about teaching students, but the meat, this medium, right? Appearing on Joe Rogan and then having 10 million people watch and maybe maybe be excited about evolution. Psychology is so much of a bigger platform that it causes me at times a bit of anx when I have to put in all the efforts that I have to put in to teach a class of 14 people. Not that each of those minds is not worthy of being educated and being inspired and so on. Uh, but I am facing at this point in my career, you know, I'm at the mid career point in my life where, you know, I could turn on my laptop and put up anything and you know, 25,000 people will watch it. This is nothing compared to your farm, but it's 25,000 people in terms of his classroom size. Exactly. Arena full of people. And so I think that's one of the things that, uh, I now struggle with. I always remain as passionate once I walk into class. I'm just as passionate just as committed. But to the extent that we have this fixed pie of time, it becomes so difficult to ever have the 12th students went out against the 12 million students

Speaker 4:          01:28:23       here would be, uh, my perspective and maybe this Ken and enhance this experience for you. I would treat it the same way that a comedian treats performing live. Like I do this podcast and every time I do this podcast, I'm reaching millions of people. What if I decided, well, you know what, I can't do the improv anymore. It's only a 190 people do the comedy store. It's only 400 people in the main room. That's not it. That's to me that analogy, it's just too small. But doing that, doing, you know, the belly room, 70 people in the comedy store, belly room, doing those little small root hones your skills. It keeps you tied into people too. It keeps you engaged with individual

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       human beings. It keeps you real. It's interesting that you say this because, uh, this, I had an MBA, I was teaching an Mba course this semester where we had to miss two classes. One because it was Canadian thanksgiving on a Monday, and then there was the provincial Canadian thanksgiving. What does that mean? The real thanksgiving? Good. Ava's first or ours. Ours is the second Monday in October. That's ridiculous. Yours is also called a green bay plays Dallas. That's called American thanksgiving. That's called November 24th mother fucker or whatever it is, Thursday. So they November. So this Mba class was being thought on Monday. So I missed one Monday because of Thanksgiving and I missed the second Monday because it was the official provincial election in Quebec and by university decree we had to cancel classes. And so the way that I made up those classes and I asked the students as I said, well you could come in on a Sunday as the university has dictated or we, I could post them, post the lectures online and then eventually I asked them, would you prefer if I posted all my lectures online and then I came in and did other stuff in class or would you prefer that I actually deliver the material live in front of you?

Speaker 2:          01:30:13       And actually a lot of them answered in a way similar to what you just said, which is there is something intimate about delivering the message right there physically, tangibly, that you can't capture online a hundred percent live performance in any way, shape or form, whether it's music or comedy or, I mean I think teaching is informed a form of live performance. That is when you have someone as disinterested and listless and just say they have no energy and they're teaching. Even if the information is fascinating, it's very difficult to absorb. Whereas if you have someone like yourself was passionate and engaging and articulate and they have life to you, like it's fun. It makes the educational experience something that it's, it's, it's a performance art. It really is. It is. You know what pisses me off though, when I received the teaching evaluations, I usually I get there.

Speaker 2:          01:31:01       They're great. Okay. I mean I scored very well, but once in a while you get someone who enters something that you know is a lie. So I'll give you an example. Someone says he wasn't accessible to his students. Well, the reality is there wasn't a single time that a student ever asked to meet me either during office hours or if they can't make office hours outside of office hours, we could do a skype chat, we could do a phone chat. I've never said, I'm not meeting you. I don't have time. We, it's never happened yet. Someone because they are protected by the cloak of anonymity because the teaching evaluations are done anonymously, can write whatever they want and there is no opportunity for you to rebut. Now of course the reality is this has no effect on my career. I mean I could easily say, who cares what they say, but I do care because probably like you, you'd like to think that every single person in that audience is going to hopefully find you funny and they walked away, entertained, you know, because of your set. And there's no way for me to rebut them. Well, when someone's

Speaker 4:          01:32:00       lying about that, that's, that's really annoying. But I feel like it's like yelp scores. You ever, you ever read the yelp reviews? Like you read them and you'll see all these wonderful reviews. The restaurant was incredible. The food was fantastic. The decor, everything about it. The waitress was amazing. The chef came over to our table and greeted us. It was so good. And then you'll see one person, everyone was rude and the food was but doll, you know, they didn't like, wait a minute, this is the same place. Exactly. So, and then, so what I always love to do, one of my favorite things to do on yelp is I will go to a restaurant and if I'm interested in this restaurant and go, wow, look at this. Got Four and a half stars, that's fucking great. And then I'll find a one star and I go, okay, let me click on their profile. And you will see a fucking tornado of one star reviews. Everybody, everything. Fucking laundromats, grocery stores, they hate everything. It's so universal. It's so common. And then occasionally like one four star review of something like a movie theater or something. Look what they're probably on adderall that day or something. It's, it's fucking weird. It's weird how many malcontents are out there. Just bouncing off of things and just angry at the world. Honking their horn and traffic and writing one star reviews.

Speaker 5:          01:33:18       I've actually thought of starting a project and I had a research assistant. Look at it, preempt it. I mean, not, yeah, exploring it for me. Uh, you tell me what you think of this hypothesis. So you have one star up to five stars, let's say on Amazon. On travel, expedia or whatever it's called, hotels, restaurants. Do you think that the amount of words that people use across the fivestars changes? In other words, for example, hypothesis might be the more negative the review, the more words are used because the body, and so probably didn't help nobody steals this idea because that's an idea that I'm hoping to test soon.

Speaker 4:          01:33:59       Oh, scientifically. Right. So if you look, yeah, you get what I'm saying? Yes. Yeah. So you, so your prediction would, there's a thing on it already. Oh, no way. Statistical difference between one star and five star reviews on yelp. There we go. Yeah, we'll make that large police. What? What year was this? Two 14 you were way behind, Bro. Okay. Many businesses in the real world encourage customers to read on yelp. Yelp. The best way to find local businesses realize on user reviews to help the viewers find the best places, both positive and negative reviews or healthfulness mission positive reviews on yelp. But, well, back to what the thing was. Yeah. No, but what I'm saying, I ain't seen her statistical differences in the amount of text just text. Right. It's is a part of, is that a part of the review?

Speaker 4:          01:34:46       Is that what they're saying? Put it up. Yeah. Types of words. You analyzed the language present. Um, but, but, but bubba and one, 125,000, 458 yelp reviews using the data sheet containing reviews at businesses and Phoenix hospital, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. When comparing the most frequent two word phrases. Okay. But this is just the words you use. So, but that's also probably, but look at that one star is. Hmm. So there's certain words that come up and run. Starve. That's not what it is though. Good. Great. Happy and contrast to one star yelp reviews. Uh, use very little positive language and instead discuss the amount of minutes, presumably much in this first section is only two word reviews. The next section here is three word reviews. And so he goes on farther. Yeah, go back to where it was reading there. Um, it says very little.

Speaker 4:          01:35:41       So five star yelp reviews contain many instances of good. Great, good. Yeah, that's just contrast the one star yelp reviews. But, but here's what's interesting. Use very little positive language, but instead discuss the amount of minutes, presumably long and unfortunate waits at the establishment. That's interesting. Las Vegas is one of the cities where the reviewers were collected, which is why appears prominently. So I don't think our people have to wait. Yeah, that makes sense. You're talking about the amount of words in the review itself and then let me just sat in there and all the size of the, um, that just the size of their review because this is a statistical analysis of the, uh, the word content. You

Speaker 5:          01:36:20       exactly. But anyway, let me, let me tell you the background. So I published a paper in 2014 in a journal called evolution human behavior where we looked at, let me just give me chance to give you a bit of background. So remember I talked earlier about the framing effect. If I tell you that a burger is 10% fat versus 90% fat free, it's the same description. It's just one way you frame it positively, negatively. So I took this idea with one of my former doctoral students and we applied it to the context of mating. So for example, if I tell you you can go out on a date with this woman and seven out of 10 of her acquaintances thinks she's intelligent. This is exactly like telling you that three out of 10 of her friends didn't think she's intelligent. Right. So I could either frame the information positively or negatively.

Speaker 5:          01:37:11       It's the exact same information and this is called the framing effect because just how you frame something causes people to change their evaluation of the person. Okay. And so what we wanted to know is whether men or women are more likely to succumb to the framing effect within a meeting context. Do you follow what I'm saying? Yes. Well before I learned not to put you on the spot, but I guess I will. Can you predict which of the two sexes is more likely to fall prey to the framing manipulation specifically in the May thing, context, emails. Fairy good. You're an evolutionary psychologist. Why women are hot, the men don't mind. Well that's not quite three of her friends say she's a car. Yeah, but that's because she's had no, none of it. That's not it. That's not the reason. The reason is because negatively framed information,

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       and this is how I'm going to tie to the study. Negative information, right? Negatively framed information looms larger and the psyche of women specifically in the mating domain, precisely because making a poor mate choice has greater consequences evolutionarily speaking for the woman, the exactly. So this is called the parental investment theory. So we took parental investment theory and applied it in this context to a framing decision and showed that when it comes specifically to the mating context, women are more likely to succumb to the framing effect. And, and, and the reason again stems from the fact that there is what's called a negative negativity bias for this. The same valence information looms larger when it's negative than it was positive precisely because we've evolved to pay more attention to negative information rather than positive information. And so that got me thinking about that hypothesis that I just told you, which is in a consumer context, do I spend more time as a consumer trying to justify my very negative decision and therefore that's why I got the word hypothesis.

Speaker 2:          01:39:03       If any bastard steels that hypothesis, I'm going to know the godfather always knows there's more into, this is a very long article that read, but it doesn't talk. It doesn't do what he was. I believe it does right here. It's like, okay, the amount of words in the review has a lesser negative effect. Review that as 333 words indicates a one star decreased, but the average amount of words in a yelp reviews 130 words, so the more words, the more likely it is to have a negative one star review. So it's already there so they aren't, they did a multifaceted analysis. The Model Experience 25 point 98% of the variation in the number of stars given in a review. This sounds like a low percentage, but it's impressive for such a simple model using unstructured real world data. Right? This, this, this, by the way, it comes from a another principle which basically says that when companies are trying to pay attention to people how satisfied they are, one dissatisfied customer ends up having much larger influence than one satisfied customer.

Speaker 2:          01:40:04       Because if you like the, the mimetic velocity of someone who's pissed as much greater than that, the Paul certainly, and that's why people were terrified of bad reviews. And you know, they don't really take too much. Here's a problem. This is a real problem. Um, fake reviews. There's a lot of companies and employ these really unscrupulous humans who will write fake reviews for your business, the right positive reviews and make it look like your business is amazing. And I guarantee you they use very few words because they just try to bang them out. It just have a bunch of fake bullshit accounts and a, you can pay someone and there's, there's services that do that. Is there any way restaurant, is there any way to algorithmically identify who the fake review because of the structure

Speaker 3:          01:40:54       of the words they use are the grammatical. So where you know it's somehow fake is I don't think so because I don't think the fake reviews are done with a Bot. I think it's done with actual humans sitting. Okay, awesome. I mean, maybe if you notice it's in broken English because they're all done in India or something like that. I think a lot of it is just people finding a loophole in the system. I actually heard someone discussing it in a restaurant. We're in a restaurant waiting to seat and this guy was telling the owner of the restaurant, you know, I have a service that can, that I know of that can help you. And they'll just leave you great reviews and it's an uh, you know, you have an amazing restaurant. I mean, you should, you should use this. And he, it's not like you're lying to the people.

Speaker 3:          01:41:38       The food's good. Like people have all these weird justification, but that, that, that again speaks to consequentialism versus the anthological. Right. I mean, if I were to point to a fault that I have, it's probably other than perfectionism, is that my mother used to always say, you need to realize that the world is not as pure as the purity bubble that you live in, and so for example, for me to lose weight through a liposuction is a form of cheating because if I don't go through the actual process of consciously altering my behavior, I don't care about the end result. The fact that you will say, Hey, you look really nice and thin. Now the fact that I did it through quote an artificial way, to me it doesn't count d. Do you think that that's too brutal of a standard or would you sooner now, not only is it not too brutal of a standard, it's actually based in logic because the people that don't alter their behavior but instead get liposuction almost always wind up putting that fat back on because they have an issue behavior.

Speaker 3:          01:42:46       Right? They have an issue with their patterns. Yeah. You know the number one pattern. If someone is thinking about losing weight, the number one pattern that I would always encourage people to do it besides changing their diet to reduce radically reduced the amount of sugar and bread and pasta they, which will in and of itself eliminate a lot of weight, is um, intermittent fasting. Meaning have a timed feeding window, give yourself eight hours a day and eat what you want to eat for eight hours. But when that eight hours is done, you don't eat for 16 hours. And that is, that is law. So you just decide what that timed window is. You decide when you're gonna start eating during the day based on when you want to eat dinner. And when you're done, when you put that fork down, there is 16 hours between then and the time you ever stuff food in your face again. And just doing that, you will lose a lot of weight. And it's a healthy way to do it. And, and it's, and it's mimicking or closer mimic of our evolutionary reality in our evolutionary reality. You did not have shelves where food was available everywhere and pantries and frigerators and superbowl was a strong proponent. This is a plug for, for a friend, uh, who's

Speaker 2:          01:43:52       the antifragile guy. Nassim Taleb is, uh, who's also Lebanese, by the way, uh, as someone who's into this intermittent fasting. And I think he swears by it, if I'm not mistaken. Yes, a lot of people do. I do. Uh, I've had many, many nutritionists and people that study the science of nutritional absorption and science of fasting. There's a real science to fasting with Dom D'agostino has done some extensive work on the positive benefits of fasting. So it was Rhonda. Patrick has discussed this in depth, but, um, intermittent fasting and that timed feeding window is just, it's so critical if you can just do that. I had a friend of mine, his dad just lost a hundred pounds doing that over the last year and a half. Yeah. He see alters diet, you know, just decided he needed to lose weight. But the big one is he just had a time to window and that time to Windows eight hours per day.

Speaker 2:          01:44:42       I organized and, uh, I think it was in April, a mini summit on health promotion from an evolutionary perspective. And so I invited several physicians who are very sympathetic to the evolutionary approach, uh, in terms of identifying ways by which we can promote health whilst recognizing some of these evolutionary imperatives. Maybe I could share one or two. Sure. So it turns out, for example, that, did you know, who is the, it, when you look at young men who suffer from erectile dysfunction, do you know what's the one behavior that these young men, because usually of course, can I call this function. It's something that is more prevalent as you get older, uh, for youth to hoe to suffer from this condition as a young man is a anomaly. What do you think is the one behavior that they share? Hmm. Um, it's quite obvious what, so a behavior that's really the true mental to your health.

Speaker 2:          01:45:37       Think of the worst one. Alcohol, no worse. Lack of sleep and worse drugs. Smoking, smoking. Yeah. So heavy smokers are likely to be the ones who are, uh, and rectum as young people. Overall vitality has probably decreased and that's one of the side effects or their body is probably like, bitch, you're so sick you shouldn't be breeding. Right. As my fact there is something she studies looking at, uh, you know, how erect your penis as a function I say as a metric of your overall health. But anyways, uh, and so I had mentioned this and several lectures and then it actually came out in a promotional campaign. I don't know if they watch my lectures. This is I think Health Canada where they had a uh, advertisement with simply a cigarette that's limp. That was it. That's the whole, now that is exactly what an evolutionary health promotion approach would be like. And then he explained why the typical approach with these types of social marketing campaigns is provide people with more information and that would cause them to alter their behavior if they're behaving in a maladaptive

Speaker 5:          01:46:50       way, if you like. It's because they didn't know any better. So I'll tell them the likelihood of them suffering heart disease when they're 73. But the reality of course is that when I'm 21, 73 is a long time away. I'm a mortal. I'm never going to suffer from these realities, right? So I can easily discount that information. But tell me, show me vividly that I might not be able to perform with my really hot girlfriend. Well, it doesn't take much of an evolutionary psychologist to understand that people will respond to this. Just to draw another parallel from the women's part, uh, women turned out to be the ones who are overwhelmingly most likely to, uh, expose themselves to the sun, whether it either the, the actual natural sun or artificial sun beds, even though they're much more knowledgeable than men about the effects of sun exposure.

Speaker 5:          01:47:38       So it's not because they didn't know any better than they were doing the behavior because they know more than men. And yet they do it more. So they do it more because of an aesthetic reason, because they think that they're going to get that health glow. I'm going to be at tonight's party. Tony's going to be there and I need to look good for Tony. So if you simply tell them that when they're going to be 74 you might suffer a greater incidence of melanoma. Who Cares? On the other hand, if you show them aesthetic ravages to your skin, that increases their attention to your message. So the bottom line is learn what are the evolutionary triggers that get people's attention and use that rather than simply provide them with more information. So that is one applied the reality of this approach. What are the evolutionary triggers that cause people to smoke in the first place?

Speaker 5:          01:48:25       Well, I don't think that's necessarily an evolutionary trait. I think it's just because tobacco is, I mean this addictive, right? And so, but that doesn't explain the initial first. Does the first time start smoking the first time you smoke? It's disgusting. Yeah. What I saw, I'm going to, I'm going off the cuff here so I don't know cause I haven't thought about that exact question. It turns out, as you probably know, that if you don't start smoking by the age of 19, I don't know why the number 19 maybe it's because it's the teenage years. You're almost guaranteed to never smoke, right? So, so the tobacco companies really have to get you when you're a kid. I know a guy who started when he was 14 actually, I met Mike. Mike. I have a cousin who started at 33. So there are anomalies. That's so crazy, isn't it?

Speaker 5:          01:49:07       So my feeling is it's probably a form. So if I'm going to link it in some way to an evolutionary mechanism, it's probably just pure conformity, right? To the extent that, that young kids think that the school to smoke, uh, they are just going to imitate others. What do you think? Um, I think they want to look cool. They see that character that's smoking and just takes that big deep drag and that exhale and they're slipping or rebel. They don't even give a fuck about their health. Looking at them out there just smoking cigarettes, right? Probably wearing leather, looking like a crazy person. Do you know what? I've never taken a single puff of my entire life to graduations. Have you? Fuck yeah. I mean, I'm not talking about is just

Speaker 4:          01:49:48       smoking. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I've, I've, uh, I smoked a cigarette when I was 15. I didn't like it. I quit. My sister stuck with it for a long time. We did it together. I was 15, she was 14. She smoked for a long time after that. So why did you do that first time? Um, I would have to go back to the time when I was 15 and ask myself, I probably just wanted to try it. I thought it was cool. That was an adult thing. We did a lot of adult things that were gross. Like we tried liquor and like, you know, there's a lot of things that we did that you were supposed to do because it was supposed to be like a cool person thing, but it's gross. Um, I've done it since then before shows because I have friends that were smokers and a, I had read that there's a nootropic benefit to nicotine and that, um, one of the things that Steven King said when he wrote his book on writing, um, one of the more, it's a great book by the way on writing if anybody's interested in writing, but coming from a real master, a guy who's been incredibly prolific, but his attitude and his philosophy on writing's pretty unique.

Speaker 4:          01:50:48       Um, but one of the things that he said that he's struggled after he quit smoking because of the synaptic, the, the, the synaptic benefit, the, the cognitive benefits of smoking was really beneficial for his writing. It like really fired up his writing. And so a couple of times back when my friend Tony Hinchcliffe, he quit recently quit like a, about a year or so ago. Uh, but he would smoke and I, and a couple of times he would be smoking before I show it said, give me one of those things. We try that I have no fear at all that I would ever be addicted to cigarettes. I have zero fear, it's not possible. There's no way in my mind set that I would ever allow myself to be physically addicted, but using it as a tool right before I went onstage, I've found it to give me like a little bit of a charge.

Speaker 4:          01:51:32       I was like, it's kind of interesting, not valuable enough for me to pursue and not necessarily even better than other nootropics or other cognitive enhancing things like coffee or, you know, for me the real one is breathing and moving around. I just like to get my blood pumping and take some big deep breaths and fire my brain up and get my like, like here we are ready. I had a cup of coffee earlier. But the stimulation of actual dialogue of, of talking to somebody and talking to an intelligent and beautiful person like yourself, why don't you love free? This is a, it's exciting. It gets you fired up and this is, it gets all the cylinders pumping. Um, but there is something to cigarettes. There's definitely something. I found it, uh, what is stimulated? What is it that made you feel so confident that you would not fall prey to its addictive properties? Why do you think that? I'm confident that I'm not a loser, period. I'm not doing anything stupid with my body. I don't, I don't, I'm not doing that. But you don't think that not trying heroin over overwhelmed power really impossible doesn't exist. There's no door. You're not getting in. While it's not, there's no fucking way. I'm going to get addicted to cigarettes and people

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       are human. And you though, but I said though, to shut up buzzy, it's not happening. So you could call somebody pussy, but I can't call them the r word. Yeah, it's crazy. That's how it works. The double standards. Well, pussies also good. That's problem with Pussy, right? The word pussy is ridiculous as a, as an insult because it's one of the most wonderful things the world has ever seen. Speaking of Pussies, did you, uh, see my, probably not, but I put out a statue, the clip where I, um, regrettably apologize to the Trans community because it turns out that I didn't know that my marriage was transphobic. Do you know why your marriage is transphobic? How? Because some trans activists have argued that it is ridiculous for heterosexual men to strictly want to mate because we were talking about pussies. So strictly want to mate with women, have pussies when there are some women who have nine inch penises that are just as much of a women.

Speaker 3:          01:53:43       Uh, and I argued that now that I've learned this, it's ridiculous that I focused on only building a life as a heterosexual man with a woman that has a vagina and not with a woman that has a nine inch penis. And therefore, I apologize for my transphobia. Well, that doesn't make any sense because shouldn't it be just like with the fat thing that you just, just choose whatever and then be happy with what you got that there's no discrimination at all. You just managed to fall in love. You just got lucky and it's an actual lots of vagina male, a woman, right? Who has about a vagina that's not surgically created. But had I been more progressive and open to the early, did you ever date a trans person? No. So there you go. You don't have to date a bunch of people like the, you know, like to say that you've never dated anybody who's over six foot five.

Speaker 3:          01:54:28       Well, you're tall phobic. That's, that's a ridiculous statement. That doesn't make any sense. You know, to say that you've, uh, you've never dated anybody that weighs more than 300 pounds. You, you know, you're, uh, you're a mass phobic. Yep. That's ridiculous too. Yeah. It's just all of it's stupid. It's all stupid people telling, but what they're doing is it's a bunch of people that are pushing this idea of being open entirely open to all things trans, that you as a heterosexual person should not just recognize that this is a woman because they chance forward from a of male to a female, but recognize even if they haven't transferred and recognize them in terms of sexual selection in terms of a date. Right. And that's just fucking stupid because you can decide, right? You're not into certain things. Like I'm not really into girls with short hair. You could decide that it's not my thing. I don't like girls with shaved heads. I don't find it attractive, like a woman can say that too. I don't like guys with creepy mustaches and nobody gets mad at him. Right. But if a man says to certain people, I'm not in the chicks with Dicks, then that guy's a piece of shit. Or what about there's a think called sexual racism where you specifically, you know, I'm not attracted to a particular, you know, yes. I don't like

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       Asian men. I don't like black women. Right. You're not supposed to instantiate those sexual preferences. If the racial queue is the one that's causing you to either be attracted or not attach to someone, what do you think of that? Um, well, there's certainly beautiful people of all race, so that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me in terms of the person selection. Like if you tell me you've never seen a beautiful black woman, right? Like you crazy. Like you have met enough black women. If you tell me 17 a beautiful Asian woman, like what? What are you saying? Like there's beautiful people in and there's also, you should be allowed to, to be with whoever you want in terms of not, but why is it, it's always sex, right? Because like obnoxious people. Here's a perfect example. I don't like friends that are loud and get drunk in public.

Speaker 2:          01:56:33       Oh, what are you drunk phobic? No, I just don't enjoy that. Right. So like in terms of sexual selection, in terms of dates, I tell you why that analogy might fail. Okay. Telling the progressive's you could alter your level of obnoxiousness. You could grow out of your box. She says, well, I know some people conceivably, theoretically, I know some people were fucked. That's just who they are. There enough. Or you want to name any names? No, but your race is a immutable part of you. Okay. That's the perspective. I see that. I mean I'm, I'm playing devil's advocate. I'm not, I'm not agreeing with it. Okay, but what about a tall versus short? Right? You know what, if you're a woman volleyball player and you're six foot three and you don't want to date a guy was five feet tall, you know, are you, what are you, what are you, by the way, that is one of the biggest problems of being a very tall woman because one of the, one of the, so there's something called assorted of mating and evolutionary theory sort of mating is basically birds of a feather flock together, right?

Speaker 2:          01:57:26       And that's very much the mechanism that drives may choice much more than opposites attract. So one of the sorts of mating cues that people most assault on his height. So it's not so much that women want guys that are only six foot or taller, it's just that the woman wants a guy who's taller than her, right? So if you look at it, there is a study that I've discussed in the past, uh, that looked at something like 720 actual couples. And I think there was only a single one out of the 720 where the woman was taller than the man. Now once a woman gets to be over a certain height, she's six foot two, six foot three, her potential pool, um, prospective suitors really shrinks. And so if you have a daughter, you really want to pray that she doesn't get too tall because boy are her choices going to be limited because few women want to date the shorter guy than them.

Speaker 2:          01:58:14       Yeah. When you're at six foot three, six foot four woman, that's gotta be a tough spot when you're basically relegated to big athletes are big giant people. The, the link, the other place where you get this sort of a sort of May thing is where you get women who are super educated, uh, that makes sense. The exact same thing happened. The more educated a woman gets, the worse her marriage prospects because the more sophisticated women are the, they insist on a high status male. And therefore, as I get more educated as a woman, there are just fewer men who are as educated or more than me and therefore I'm doomed to a life of solitude. That totally makes sense. That totally makes sense. Especially considering that men, you know, in general, they get insecure around women who are more successful and more educated or more intelligent.

Speaker 2:          01:59:07       Like very rarely are men comfortable with a woman who has to explain things to them. Absolutely. Yeah. By the way, I think I have another theory which I'd like to, at some point test, maybe someone will steal it now. So when you have a couple that gets married very young, they are judging one another based on their mate value at 18 or 19 right. So Tony is the high school quarterback and so he's the hot guy and I'm the cheerleader and then later he stagnates. He doesn't go on with his career. Whereas I go on and become a physician. I, I'm a cheerleader. So at 29 there is not a huge inequity between our two mating values on the mating market. Right. So when we were both 19 the fact that we had roughly the same may thing, value made us a very attractive, stable couple.

Speaker 2:          01:59:54       But Tony turned out to be a fucking loser. Exactly. He's a lame duck. Right, exactly. And so I, so I have a theory that I'd like to at some point tested. Maybe some graduate student will write to me saying, I'll work with this on you. The doctor side, I have a theory whereby I think that in many cases where people end up divorcing when they married young, it's precisely because that which started as equitable mating values at time t zero turned out to have huge divergence in our trajectory on the mating market and that puts a huge strain on the marriage, especially when the wife status is going up. That the best way to ensure that the marriage ends as for the status of the woman to keep going up and that of the man to either stagnate or go down, that's going to be doomed.

Speaker 2:          02:00:40       That makes sense. It May. It makes sense that also, you know, obviously the young marriages are rough because people grow and they don't necessarily grow together. We catch people 10 years later and they're oftentimes radically different people. Right. But then there's also the thing that women don't seem to, for the most part, respect a man is not doing as well as them. All right. You know, that's a, that's a giant issue. Even if the guy's doing okay, like say if your guys making $50,000 a year, that's a very good living. He's out there doing well but you make 300 let me 300 grand a year and this fucking losers over here with his 50 grand like you're kicking ass, you'll like some big wig at some big corporation. Like that seems to be a real sticking point. And with men, especially if they have a household where they contribute income together, they pile all the income and the man starts spending the woman's money on stuff. You know, he starts buying stuff. You've got a new fishing rod. Did you get

Speaker 5:          02:01:40       that with your money or my money? You know, it gets weird. Right? And incidentally, uh, so speaking of say, consumer psychology stuff that I study, when you take a very rich woman and you go out on a date with her, even though she obviously can afford the dinner and she can afford anything that you're going to buy her, if you exhibit cues of frugality, cheapness, that's the perfect way to ensure that you won't have a second date. So it's not so much a question of uh, you know, it's an old sexist, the ritual whereby men were wooing women. It really is an honest signal of your commitment to, to a woman. So the best way, and I get many of these letters where people ask me, hey professor, what are, you know, dating advice? Well, you do have to exhibit generosity when you go out with the nuptial gift giving them, she'll give, giving.

Speaker 5:          02:02:29       Is it sort of the fancy term for courtship rituals across animal species? So many species, you have typically the male engaging in some form of courtship gift giving and depending on the quality of the gift, will determine whether the female will mate with your not while so much of what we do in marketing context is exactly that, right? It's the exact same phenomenon repeating itself in the human context, right? Uh, uh, engagement rings, right? The fact that you supposed to spend a quarter of your yearly salary on this rock, is that really what it is? Yeah, that's what I'm, I don't know if everybody meets it, but that's right. It is that right? It's three months. Exactly. God, when you say a quarter of the yearly salary, it makes you just go, what in the fuck is wrong with people? But the reason so much money, but here's the, but here's the reason.

Speaker 5:          02:03:19       Here's the reason you ready? It's, it's what's called as the Javian signal. I don't know if I've ever discussed this and this and this podcast is a Javian signal is basically the idea that for a signal, to be honest, it has to be costly. Otherwise everybody could imitate it. Right? So, so think about, for example, rites of passage in different cultures, right? If you want to demonstrate that you're a top warrior, the rite of passage has to be brutal. Otherwise, if it's only, we all have to do five setups than every male could do it. And then the females can determine the pretenders from the real guys, right? So you have, for example, bullet ant, do you know this one too? Right? You put your hands through. I mean, that takes a lot of courage and capacity to people who don't know what we're talking about.

Speaker 5:          02:04:03       So this is a tribe in the Amazon whereby you take the bullet, ant is supposedly the biggest purveyor of pain that is humanly possible that you could experience. Our friend Steve gets done by one, did it, and what? He was in a Bolivia, I believe. And uh, he gets done and a in his heel, got him in the heel and he said it was just, he was delirious. What's happening? Except you said it lasts for a few hours and it goes away, right? So what they do in this tribe is they take a bunch of these ants in the order of a couple of hundred. One is enough to cause agonizing and possible delirious pain. And they said, date them through this compound. Uh, and then they inter weave them in these gloves, these leaf gloves, so that when they're coming to, they come out of their stupor and you have your hands in there, they start viciously biting you, stinging you, and you're supposed to withstand that pain without screaming.

Speaker 5:          02:05:05       You have to take it. And so you sort of almost go onto this religious fervor, this kind of, uh, incantation. And you have to do that ritual 20 separate occasions, the 10th, 20 different times on different days, 2020 before you are admitted into the tribe of Warriors, whatever. Well, now let's think back to the engagement ring, right? If all it takes for me to convince you of my honest intentions as to buy you flowers and now let's go back behind the shed and have sex, well then a lot of cheaters are going to convince you of doing this when they really didn't have good intentions. But if it takes for me to spend a quarter of my salary to convince you that I have, so therefore this is a form of what's called a a signaling because the harvey was a Israeli or an athol adjust that studied this type of behavior, this costly signaling behavior using Arabian babblers, which is a type of bird.

Speaker 5:          02:06:00       So here's another example of as a hobby and signal, uh, you probably have seen this, uh, when you have a Predator, uh, that's looking at who to attack, you often will have gazelles starting to actually make themselves conspicuously visible to the Predator. They come close to them and they start jumping from, have you ever seen this? You know, I think it's called stroking, not strutting. And can you think why that would be? Like, why are they not hiding? Why are they not making themselves, uh, in conspicuous? Why? Why are they drawing attention to themselves when they are 50 different gazelles that the Predator could be pointing to? Why? Well, because what it, what, what that animal is saying is the fact that I could stand here in front of you and jump up and down and make myself this visible, suggest that it's probably a lost cause for you to try to go after me.

Speaker 5:          02:06:56       I'm super fit. Right? It's a costly signal of my fitness. It's an honest signal, right? The one who is not doing this behavior is the one that you should be paying attention to. Ah, interesting. So this is called, and so I use this principle of the Javian signaling to explain things like conspicuous consumption, right? The reason why you buy the fancy car that the other males can't hope to purchase, it's precisely because they can't afford to match your signal. Therefore, it's an honest signal. The reason why I buy $100 million painting that a monkey could have drawn shows how wealthy I am, that I could waste $100 million.

Speaker 3:          02:07:38       Ah, that makes sense. That makes sense. It's all just meeting stuff. It's mating and food. Yeah. You don't want to become somebody dinner. You want to find dinner and you want to have sex. Good night everybody. Yeah. Those signals are so fascinating when we see them in our culture and people get angry at them. Like you see some guy pull up in a Ferrari and you go look at this fucking loser with those little Duke, right? You're like maybe or maybe a guy with a shitload of money wants to let the world know cause he likes to fuck you. Right. I've shared actually on this show, I think the stories about my, one of my brother's who was a big car collector, three Ferrari's, Aston Martin Lagonda and I've even shared a story which I'm happy to repeat, uh, of we would go to nightclubs where he's this, this is the Olympian, this is the five foot three guy

Speaker 5:          02:08:31       go to nightclubs and he would pick the most beautiful woman and approach her even though she's accompanied by six foot four, you know, tough fucking guy. And, and he had that confidence, I think because he had that wealth catapulting him. He

Speaker 3:          02:08:46       certainly helps. It certainly helps. Yeah, it's, um, it, it, uh, it is a weird ever prevalent aspect in the communication between men and females is how much money does the man have? Right? I mean, and this is one thing that will, a lot of women hate because they don't want to feel like they could be purchased and they can't. They can't. They can't. Some can write a lot, Ken. It's a factor. It's a big, and a lot of women are very just rabidly ruthlessly independent. They don't want that ever in their life and good for them. But, but the reality is it's a very effective strategy. You pull up in that Ferrari or that Rolls Royce or whatever the fuck you're driving and it has a big impact and you get to that nightclub. And those studies have been done endlessly. Psychology. So here's one example.

Speaker 5:          02:09:36       And you don't need to have a signal as big as a Ferrari. Just how you dress in terms of the status that is exhibited. So there's a study that was done I think in the early nineties, where they manipulated the status, the, the sartorial, the, the attire of men and women, and to one of three different types, you know, high status medium and you know, some tee shirt or Mcdonald's uniform, whatever. And then they asked men and women, uh, one of six possible, would you go out for coffee with this guy? Would you go out on dinner? Would you have sex with them? Would you marry him? And across all six levels of relationships, the status of the attire of a man had a profound effect on the likelihood of the woman saying, yes, hire the status. The more likely she said yes. That same manipulation on women had zero effect on men. And in other words, no man has ever uttered the following words words, my God, you've got a juicy, but, and I'd love to have sex with you, but you're not exhibiting cues of ambition, therefore no sex for you, Linda. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:10:41       So that's a reality. That's a reality that people are very uncomfortable with. And I don't think women necessarily are craving the same reaction from men because of their ambition. I don't think women are ever sang through my ambition. I'm going to get a good man. Right. You know, that's just, it's just not a factor. But they do say through my ambition, I'm never going to need a map. True. That's because that's because, look, there's a reality is there's a lot of shitty human beings out there and some of them have penises and if you're a woman and you run into too many of those or for buy for whatever reason, because of your environment, because of your behavior, because of the circles you travel in your around too many of them. There's a large dating pool of shitheads out there. You know, you just say, I don't want this in my life. I want, I don't want to be like my mom. I don't want to be like my sister. I want to be independent. But what you're not saying is I am going to get a bar house and a baller car and I'm going to get me a man. And the only woman that I know of that I've ever heard say that is disgusting. And the only woman that I ever, she's like, you know, talking about her success and our success allows her to get men. She's a foul beast. Lau. Yeah. She's not, it's not healthy

Speaker 5:          02:11:56       can and a lot of women, it's not so much that their interest, I mean resources are good only to the extent that they allow you to ascend the social hierarchy. Right. This doesn't explain why some women are attracted to the starving artists. Right. Because what, why are so many women romanticizing over the guy with the guitar, but that's because they are choosing him based on his future trajectory. Right. I am. I am banking on the fact that you exhibit enough talent that I suspect that by investing in you, by choosing you, it's going to take me to that trajectory. Yeah. No woman has ever authored the following words. You have no talent. You exhibit no ambition. You're never going to step out of the basement. Let's have sex. And yeah, so, so it's not that women are only interested in money. They're interested in a panoply of cues, all of which relate to the potential of ascending the social hierarchy.

Speaker 4:          02:12:50       Yeah, that makes sense. You know, it makes sense that these things are biologically interwoven into our psyche. No kidding. It makes sense. I mean, it just, it, it's unavoidable.

Speaker 5:          02:13:00       Well, that's, that's why I'm always on. I think the first time that I came on the show, we discussed this, I'm, I'm always amazed that so many people have such antipathy towards evolutionary psychology because there is really no other game in town. I mean it, what else could explain the evolution of the most important organ that defines our person had called the human mind, right? I mean, you're comfortable accepting that the liver and the kidneys and the heart has involved through evolution, but you can't accept that your mind and your brain has evolved through evolution. So it's really, it's an form

Speaker 2:          02:13:32       insane form of science denialism that I've spent 25 years fighting and I'm not sure if I'm any closer to winning the battle. It's the only form of science now as, and it's culturally acceptable. It's culturally acceptable because it defines people in a way that makes them feel like animals are, it makes them feel cheap or makes them feel like they're prostitutes, you know, makes it, makes people feel like they're prostitutes, and interestingly, it comes a lot more for this particular form of science than eyes and from the left. This is why a lot of a lot of people will write me and say, well, why do you seem to be critiquing a lot more people on the left and the right? That's not, that's not showing my political colors. It's simply because the ecosystem that I navigate in, which is called academia, it just so happens that most of the bs comes from the left because the academia is laden with leftists.

Speaker 2:          02:14:19       Yeah, so it's not so much that I give a free pass to the right. When you have a right wing senator who denies evolution, I'm the first to also critique him, but the reality is when it comes to human nature, it's really the leftists who are denying the biological basis of our human nature. Why do you think that this science denialism is so prevalent on the last, on the left when it comes to gender? Because gender seems to be the battleground. It seems to be the battleground even in terms of transgender, right? Uh, but the, the, the battleground of gender, whether it's the gender pay gap or whether it's traditional gender roles, this seems to be where science denialism it lives on the left in the more, you know, like what I always grew up thinking about the left, the left was always more open minded. They were supposed to be the more educated and they were supposed to be the more compassionate people. So something happened, and I don't know when it happened, but somewhere along the line, this science denialism and then this, for whatever reason, this idea that if it shows any differences, if there's any statistics or any data that shows differences between the men and the women, that this is somehow,

Speaker 1:          02:15:37       yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:15:38       this is somehow an example of sexism or patriarchal tyranny or there's a reason for this that's negative. So I think the reason is actually quite, quite simple. At the right wing, folks who deny science, it's typically for religious, ideological reasons or for industry, right? So, so there is some pet ideology that is threatening me and therefore I'm going to deny science, right? This exact same thing is happening with the left. They also have been parasitized by a quasi religion. It's called progressivism. Okay. And I say progressivism in quotes, right? Uh, you know, equality of outcomes and all the rest of the garbage. Right? And therefore to the extent that evolutionary theory in general, but evolutionary psychology in particular is a threat to my quasi religion than I will reject

Speaker 3:          02:16:30       it. This is why evolution deniers tend to be on the right and evolution psychology than Iris and the beyond the left. They've both been parasitized by religions, they're just different religions. That's all. That's a fascinating way to look at it, that progressivism is in fact some sort of religion. And it makes sense if you're looking at the science and now as I'm aspect of it, because you're not looking at it in terms of an objective analysis of all the facts and the data that's in front of you. You're saying, what fits this construct, what fits this pattern of behavior that I've chosen to adopt? And then I have to show all the people that are around me exactly like you accused Sean Carroll of doing exactly adopting this instead of looking at the actual facts of this case. Postmodernism, I think, did you have, you had the grievance studies folks, right?

Speaker 3:          02:17:17       Fantastic. Peter Boghossian. Yeah, I mean, Kim's Lindsey, could you, could you believe that this is stuff that is repeatedly wonderful, right? That podcast? If you haven't heard it, folks, please listen to it. These guys, uh, and uh, Gow w with a woman from Helen flunk rose as James Lindsey and pitbull Goshen. Yeah. People goes, he and James Lindsey with your own. We're here. Uh, the woman Helen lives in England. Um, and they came on the podcast and they talked about all these different false studies and false papers that they published that were peer reviewed and published in academic journals that like things like what was the one heteronormatity and dog parks so that the humping, and I tell you a quick funny story phobia and dog parks. I, so I'll, I'll, I'll say this, some, a few folks knew about this project before it came out. One of them has a name that sounds like glad slash.

Speaker 3:          02:18:20       Ad. Oh, I know that guy. He's just glad father, this is the godfather. Now it turns out that I didn't know the which, which particular studies they were sending out. I knew about the general project, but I didn't know the details. And so I wonder, this project go on for, I think it was maybe 18 months, if I'm not mistaken, something that aura well at, at one point I was flipping through something, whatever, and I saw the dog rape culture stuff new. So I contact feet. I go, I just, there was no even sanitation, there wasn't, hi, how are you? I go, dog park rape you.

Speaker 3:          02:18:57       So he calls me up like within a few seconds, he's just cracking up laughing. That's the background to some of these stories. He was up for some sort of disciplinary review right after he left the podcast with me. I don't know how that went or what went. A lot of people are gunning for him. Yeah, I know he was. He's explaining that. But I think what he's doing is very valuable and I think that it needs to be known. And especially in terms of like people listening to this, they're going to send their kids to these fucking schools and spend $50,000 a year.

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       This is why, by the way, people, oftentimes people write to me. Even even my wife was nice. Tell me, why do you care so much about this? Is it because imagine all of these people, they're spending their parents hard earned money. They could have been studying tons of really interesting, true things. And I don't mean true. It has to be scientific. You could study art and you could study literature, you could study philosophy. So I'm not, I'm not creating a hierarchy of knowledge. It's all good. But as long as you are committed to reason, to logic and so on, these fields are what I call intellectual terrorism there nihilist. And it pisses me off as a professor that they've been allowed to promulgate for 40 50 years, untouched. And so those who argue that these guys were frauds because they, they, you know, they, they submitted these papers under a pseudonym.

Speaker 2:          02:20:14       Well, what did you expect them to do? I mean, if you're a whistle blower, do you not submit your complaint or using the name Jane Doe? So the fact that they use a pseudonym that's hardly fraudulent, if you're going to demonstrate how fraudulent that whole enterprise is. So what if you use the false name and what do you think? Don't you agree? Oh, 100%. Yeah. It's, it's important. It's important to expose this idiocy cause it's, it's so prevalent and it's so ridiculous and there's a bunch of fake intellectuals out there that are repeating all this nonsense. Right? And so when they see this and what's should be almost like onion level satire, obvious. And they don't think so. And they reward it and they, they talk about, it's one of the best papers they've read this year. Cause I mean, these people are preposterous. And this is just one of those things where you let people get away with things and then they keep pushing it.

Speaker 2:          02:21:08       They keep pushing it, it goes further. They keep getting further with it and eventually they just get away. They're there too, too far gone. You can't bring them back. I actually told Pete and I, I hope, I don't think he'll mind that I'm sharing this. Uh, but when, when he was telling me about the project, one of the things that I try to temper or his expectations of how much of a fatal blow the project would be, he, I had the feeling that he was thinking that if we are successful as the end of the bullshit, the bullshit edifices and I kept saying, look, I think it's really important what you're doing. And of course I supported and I anyway, that I can help and advise you and so on. I'm, I'm there for you, but I don't think you should think that it's going to end.

Speaker 2:          02:21:50       And I think I've been proven to be right at 100% right. Because I think postmodernism by its very definition is almost like a snake that can't be killed. Right. Who are you to judge what is bullshit or not exactly. I mean, what percentage of an impact do you think it had? Do you think it killed 1% of the bullshit? Maybe a bit more. Uh, maybe two. I can't put a number, but I circled five. Let's be generous. Let's go with five. By the way, I've spoken to Allan socalled, the original Ho. Do you know the, the history of this type of hoaxing? No. So the original hoax was done by Allen. So

Speaker 5:          02:22:25       cow, s, O, k, a l who is a physicist who in 1996 submitted a paper. He's so, he's a physicist. So He's, you know, hardcore scientists. And he won. He was so pissed off at all these postmodernists that he submitted a paper, uh, on the Hermeneutics of gravity, all this kind of bs. And they of course lapped it up because he was a physicist who's now joining the Pantheon of our bullshit, therefore, let's accept it. And then of course, at that point he said, oh, I have something to admit to you guys. Now, him and I had communicated at one point ad within an article about his hoax and he corrected me. It was very, very cute. Cause I said, you know, this guy created some pseudo random bullshit. And he said, well, you know, professor side, I actually spent quite a bit of effort coming up with all these words. So it wasn't random bs. It was very well thought out vs. So this is a guy that you might want to have on, I don't know if he doesn't have any of these pockets, but he's the, he's the, the, the godfather of hoaxing. Uh, this stuff.

Speaker 4:          02:23:29       It's just gotta be so frustrating to be in academia and to see all this around you and see all these false thinkers. He's these fake people. Absolutely. Putting this con game in the middle of a real learning institution. And not only that, but this being celebrated by other true academics because they don't want to get called out as being racist or homophobic or transphobic or whatever the fuck it is. These morons are celebrating, right. This, this is a weird trickery. It to me, it's almost like being a comedian, being around joke thieves, right? It's like almost the same thing. Like, I know you're not the same thing as me. You're a faker. You're faking this thing. We're in this artist colony. Everybody else is struggling to come up with material and you're just stealing it. And this is what is going on with these gender studies. People like your pretend a year, an intellectual craziness. You're, you're, you're ignoring the science.

Speaker 5:          02:24:25       So I have a theory. So the original postmodernists were all French modernist. I don't know if you know their name, but for your viewers, this is Michel Foucault, [inaudible] and Jacques Derrida. The three grand bullshitters. Okay. And so I have, what year was this? the 70s this is sort of about the sixties and 70s really went into full throttle. Okay. You did it like that. Right? Now I, I'm going to link this back to mating. Remember we said everything. Okay? Now I genuinely think that in the deep recesses of their minds, these three fraudsters did not believe a single thing and what they were doing. But they quickly learned that if they stood in front of a crowd, authored some full profundity jibberish and you had all the hot, beautiful young ladies sitting and looking at you as if you're a deep poet, they quickly learned that there's evolutionary rewards that come with their full profundity. And so the train was off and they weren't going to, yes, it's what off the station and then that's it. The trajectory set. I truly believe

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       that if we could ever find some diary or something of these there, they probably have written my God that I get a lot of women, I guess Michel Foucault was gay. Maybe a lot of young men, uh, through my trickery. In other words, I think they admitted it that openly. No, I don't even in a diary. I doubt they admitted it to themselves that openly. But so do you think that in the deep recesses of their mind when they went to bed, do you think that they've convinced themselves that they are saying something profound or they know, I know they're locked into, I think this is what I think when most people are engaging in that sort of deceptive behavior, they're locked into a pattern that they know is effective. That pattern has some sort of an effect of a beneficial effect on them. Whether it's sexually, whether it's in terms of the social dynamics that they exist in.

Speaker 3:          02:26:11       There's this pattern. They've found this pattern that they can pursue. That's what I believe. So therefore they are being self deceptive to the point where they believe their bullshit when immediately maybe not even being self deceptive, but certainly not being self analytical. They've, they've, they've hit this hotspot where they, you know, they lock in and then they, they just follow what's effective and what's working. Yeah. Perhaps you right. That's what I think is good. I do think though that eventually all of these guys will die out. No. So you think that the bs, we'll just find a new way. It'll metamorphosize into some new instantiation, but it's always, there's always going to be a critical mass of bs in the university. I think there's always going to be a bunch of people that want to believe in things that are not true, because that makes them seem better than what they really are.

Speaker 3:          02:26:59       There's been, there's always going to be a bunch of people that want to avoid the reality of essentially lives unfair, a ladder system of competition. There's, there's just, it's just unfair. It was just a lot of it. It's just like, it's the natural, the natural world. Nature itself is unfair. Just in general, you know, the, the, the salmon never gets to eat the eagle. It's just, it's not fair. And I think there's a lot of people that find these inequalities and find this unfairness very disconcerting. It disturbs them to no end. And they set out on a quest to try to morph the world and to some weird utopian fantasy land where everything has an equal outcome. It doesn't exist. But in people that are fucked, you know, you get people that look like Lena Dunham and they want to like sort of like balance out the playing field.

Speaker 3:          02:27:51       This is like, it's not fair, right? It's like how come scarlet Johannson is a woman and how can we had done on is a woman like what the fuck? Like that's not fair. Right? It's not. It's, there's a lot of things that aren't fair. There's a lot of things that aren't fair. Intellectually I know the way people's minds function, they're not this, there's people that are elon musk and then there's a other folks, right? We're just not that bright. And this is just the way the world. So do you, do you think as as fighters for reason, our objective is to simply make sure that the number of bullshitters stays below certain thresholds. Since we can't eradicate and fully according to your view, at least what we could do is sort of steady the tide so that they're always below a certain number. In other words, 10% of the people are going to be bullshitters in the university and as long as they don't get past that threshold, we're doing a good job.

Speaker 3:          02:28:40       Whereas I'd like to be more optimistic. I'd like to eradicate all of the bullshitters. I don't think that's possible, but I think that bullshit as a whole is very attractive to people and it's very attracted to people to pursue. It's very attracted to people to engage in, uh, they don't like reality and they want to change things. There's a lot of bullshit that this exists in our culture and has forever. Why the Fucker chiropractors still around? Why are psychic still around, right? Like there's a lot of nonsense out there. And then when you look into what those, what, what real evidence there is that psychics are real, it's almost zero. And I could link it by the way to marketing. So, uh, the dove, the Dove Company, they're probably their most successful campaign of all time has been one where they argued that beauty is a social construct.

Speaker 3:          02:29:27       You're all beautiful in your own way. Now that again is a beautiful message, right? Because if I am someone, if I'm a woman who doesn't score well on the typical evolutionary cues, then what do I want to hear? I want to hear that there is no such thing as evolutionary cubes. It's all socially constructed, right? If I have sagging breast, if I have poor skin, eh, and so on, if I have wrinkly skin, I'd like to believe that there is no such thing as an universal beauty standards. And in that sense, dove has been incredibly successful because by peddling false hope, they've actually been able to tap into women's insecurities and incense. That's good marketing. Right? Did you see the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine that was widely criticized because they had a morbidly obese woman on who was, uh, you know, a bikini plus size model?

Speaker 3:          02:30:15       Yeah, yeah. And they were challenging beauty norms. Like this is a person that's eating themselves to death. You've fucking assholes. And so your lack of discipline and your desire to shame people who exercise and is what you're doing to make them feel bad because you feel bad that you can't put the fucking cook cookies and cupcakes down as a lead. You to try to push this ridiculous standard and me and one of the things, my point of view was could you imagine if the cover of men's health had an enormous fat guy with his gut hangover, his belt and and people were saying the new standards of attractiveness for men have been changed by Mike who just drinks beer and eats cake. He'd be like, get the fuck Outta here. That's never going to fly. It's not going to fly with men, but it does fly with women and by the way they go ahead. The Fat Acceptance Movement doesn't just argue that you know, not being 500 pounds is unattractive because of the patriarchy. They actually argue that the medical evidence suggesting that there is a link between obesity and downstream

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       bad effects is all bullshit.

Speaker 4:          02:31:22       They've not done, not just that they there. They also point to one incredibly flawed study that has been wildly disproven that says that there's some sort of vigor or vitality involved in being overweight because they get sick less. There's no, no truth to that whatsoever. They only, they only analyze people who were healthy at the time. Like it's, it's there's, you can go and Google the study and find out the this criticism of that study, but it's a hundred percent horseshit folks being fat's not good for you. It's really bad for you when you're as big as that woman on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine. She's literally morbidly obese. She's fucking dying. She's addicted to food in a horrible way and to promote that and pretend that somehow or another this is okay and it's, we're going to, we're going to show new standards of beauty. You Go, you giant gelatinous bag of meat and tissue. No, that's a dying person who's addicted to food. She doesn't want to look like that.

Speaker 5:          02:32:19       I feel as though given that on one of the shows she spent about 45 minutes fat shaming me that Jamie talked to you about your diet. There hasn't been a recognition of your slimness much, much slimmer. You are slim or felt a bit of drool coming. When I first came and there was a bit of drool on the side of your thing when you saw me was no drill. I'm happy for you. Thank you. There's no drill. How much weight have you lost? About 30. That's nice. And other very good. And I have to register as a dangerous weapon. Wow. 30 more. Yeah, you're on the door. Um, what do you do in different great question at being accountable to the scale, being accountable to how many things go in my mouth. So meaning every Friday, no matter what I get on the scale, you see what I'm saying?

Speaker 5:          02:33:06       Yeah. So I've put on three pounds, therefore I intercept that trajectory at three pounds rather than in four years when I get on the scale and I'm all, all 32 pounds overweight. So number one being uh, you know, privy to that information. Secondly, my wife, whom you've met many times, enters all my stuff and my fitness pal.com. So at the end of the day, at the end of the day, she tells me you've eaten 1,792 calories and you've exercise 400 calories, you at 1300 calories. Good. Now you might say that's not sustainable to be so sort of Nazi, like in terms of your accountability for your whole life. But for me that really works because I'm very, you know, objective oriented. If I let it slide, then I can wake up one day and I'm 30 pounds over.

Speaker 4:          02:33:54       I don't think our fat shaming you at all. Now that I think about, I'm just trying to show you anything about your back and you couldn't get on my machine. That's what it was. I don't think we even talked about your weight.

Speaker 5:          02:34:04       We did. We did. We spent about 40 minutes, 40 minutes. As a matter of fact, I remember that. I know that you don't read your comments. I had gone to check some of the comments that some people were quite upset at you fat people. No for you. Just hiring fat. I'll maybe

Speaker 4:          02:34:18       get off your ass. You fast flux. Lazy Bitch. I knew it was coming from, I was coming from concern and love. I didn't take it badly. Have you looked at what Jordan Peterson is doing? A lot of the meat stuff, right? Yeah, the carnivore diet, so very fascinating. He's lost 50 pounds. He looks amazing. He said he's at his intellectual peak. He sees overrunning with energy. It doesn't take any supplements, doesn't take anything, just eats meat. Wow. It's astounding. Do is there, I know that, is that sorta the Quito thing, right? Does it pretty, no, it's not. It's different because a glucogenesis um, when you have a, Kido is more fat than anything. It's more fat even than protein. He's eating mostly protein and fat, but much more protein that you would get an Akita agentic diet. I see. So he's not necessarily in a state of ketosis.

Speaker 4:          02:35:05       I mean be probably a, some of the time when your body has a large quantity of protein, your body converts that protein into glucose and the glucogenesis. It's a very interesting process, but it's one of the reasons why if you eat too much protein, it knocks you out of ketosis because your body changes. It turns it into glucose. What he's doing is essentially an elimination diet. He's only eating meat. And when I've talked to like actual real nutrition experts who really understand the process, they do not recommend what he's doing. Right. But I think maybe that's because it hasn't been done and studied on a wide scale before. There have been a few anecdotal reports about people have eating just meat for 20 years and they're real healthy. It seems to really be effective with people that have autoimmune issues. People that have psoriasis, people that have various autoimmune conditions.

Speaker 4:          02:35:57       It seems that cutting out all inflammation causing foods, meaning dairy, um, sugar, all the pasta and bread, all those things seem to have a profound effect on certain people. His daughters, one of them, he's one of 'em and I know some other people as well. I know some really smart people that have gotten into that and they've experienced profound changes in their body composition. They've lost a tremendous amount of weight, even people that are eating a large amount of meat. Um, it's not something that's attractive to me. First of all, I think fiber's important, phytonutrients or report and there's a lot of stuff you get from vegetables. And also I don't have a negative reaction to vegetables. It doesn't seem to be affecting me, but some people, I think it's entirely possible do right. And I think if you do have some really profound autoimmune issues, particularly it seems to be effective with certain types of arthritis, it's not the worst thing to give a shot. I would definitely recommend that if you did do something like that that you would supplement. And a, I don't think Jordan's doing that at all. I don't think there's any harm whatsoever in supplementing with multivitamins, getting your essential new nutrients, essential fatty acids from fish oil, the vitamin B Complex d complex. Make sure you've got all your bases covered nutritionally. And then if your

Speaker 3:          02:37:16       body just responds really well to only eating meat, I think Jordan looks fantastic. Every time I talked to me it looks better. I would be curious to know though what some of his metrics are. The ild Lhd. Yes. Well here's the thing about that, you know, that is very poorly understood and almost always misinterpreted the ldl hdl correspondence and what it means in terms of like whether or not you're healthy, arterial plaque is important. And then there's, there's all sorts of markers that can show inflammation, inflammation in your body, um, what your blood pressure is. How some people react much differently to various foods, right? We obviously know that some people are allergic to certain nuts. I'm sure this, there's people very biologically, so much that one of the things it needs, new nutrition experts are saying that if you just have your body consumed just one thing and this elimination diet, it eliminates so many different processes that your body has to engage in in order to break down all the other different things and in it, it eliminates all the different reactions that you get from all these various foods.

Speaker 3:          02:38:26       Your body's only concentrating on one food all the time and it seems to alleviate a lot of these conditions. There's also the fact that when you're eating just meat, you're not going to be as hungry. You're not going to, you're not going to overeat as much. It's, it's much less likely that you overeat with protein than it is that you overeat with pasta breads and sugars and things along those lines. In terms of caloric intake, just you, you hate, you reach your satiety point very quickly. Yes and that is probably a factor as well because Jordan has lost a tremendous amount of weight and I think in losing that weight, his body's less inflamed. He has less fat that's inhibiting his motion and and you know his arteries and his body is his is his limbs aren't as fat. It's faces not as fat. He's not snoring anymore, which indicates that he was, he probably had some fat and his face and it was kind of blocking and and constricting his breathing.

Speaker 3:          02:39:23       It's all really interesting. There's a gentleman I not sure if I'm going to get his name right. He's a nutritional psychiatrist at Columbia University. I just discovered him recently while working out on the elliptical. I don't throw the uh, big think series and he's got a couple of short clips where he talks about how he incorporates nutrition within his psychiatric practice. I think his name is drew Ramsay. He seems like a guy that would be unplugging so many people. Probably a few too many buddies. I'm like, I'm such a good a booking agent at this point. Right? No. But I mean he seems like a really interesting guy b and shows you, here's a psychiatrist who, who thinks ultimately that a lot of our, you know, mood related issues relate to what we put in our bodies. Well, there's no question that inflammation has a direct result or a direct action on how you think and feel.

Speaker 3:          02:40:16       Uh, inflammation makes people irritated, makes people with our JIC does a lot of terrible things to just your body in general, which affects your brain, which is a part of your body. You know, the idea that there's somehow or another and interchangeables pretty preposterous and people that don't take care of their body but want their brain to be healthy. That is like, you want your cake and you want to eat it too. I mean, it's like you don't, you don't make any sense. You're not looking at it holistically. So someone who is as passionate as you are about these issues, if someone in your family, whether it be your wife or your children, we're not doing the right choices. Does that cause you to be that much more irate because they're sort of within the purview of your influence or how do you risk they were rebelling.

Speaker 3:          02:40:57       I would think that maybe I'm being an overbearing asshole. I was looking at it internally first and then um, I would look at them and try to figure out like what, what is, what is, what's wrong here? Is this simply a dietary thing or is it a psychological thing? It will become a big project for sure. I mean when there's a loved one that's essentially eating themselves into poor health. Right. Which is really common. I mean it's more common than it's not. In fact, I think the most recent estimate, Google this if you will, young Jamie, I think the most recent estimate is it the United States is above 50% obesity rate. Right. It's incredible. Which is stunning. I actually, when I was at the Canadian Senate hearings, I actually argued that if we wished to get rid of bigotry, then we'd, we'd get a lot more bank for our buck if we went after fat bigotry rather than transgender bigotry because there are so few people who are transgendered.

Speaker 3:          02:41:52       And even though we should condemn any bigotry day face, they make up a very small portion that I was being facetious, right. But I was basically arguing that, look, if you really want to have, uh, these bills to try to stamp out bigotry, you should be going after fatphobia because most Canadians are also obese now. They didn't get, I said it's a sizable problem. Many of them that OBC United States here it goes a 2018 course. Behavioral Risk Factors, adult obesity rates now exceed 35% in seven states. Yeah. But what about children as well? I think um, they were talking about overall, I think overall, I think children are more fat now than they've ever been ever. Well, I had the mode, I mentioned earlier that I had about, let me read all that. It's good to get the actual numbers again. So, uh, it chill. Uh, adult obesity exceeds 35%, 30% 29 states, 25% in 48 states. West Virginia has the highest adult obesity rate, 38% Colorado, lowest to 22 shout out to Colorado adult obesity rate increased in Iowa, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina. What is it by, for not just adult obesity, but overall obesity.

Speaker 1:          02:43:03       That's fine.

Speaker 3:          02:43:07       What does the obesity rate in America, 160 million people, there it is, hundred

Speaker 4:          02:43:12       and 60 million people in America are either obese or overweight. Nearly three quarters of American men and more than 60% of women, more than 60% of women are overweight. 30% of boys

Speaker 5:          02:43:25       end girls under the age of 20 or obese or overweight. So remember I was mentioning earlier, I was mentioning the health summit that I held at my university at one of the guys. His name is Robert Lustig. He's a pediatric endocrinologist. He was our, he was saying that many instances of diabetes and other really high blood pressure that you would never ever see in young children is now very, very common. Sorry, 25, 30 years ago, he would never have a single patient who was under a certain age and now it's every, every day. Basically it's US

Speaker 4:          02:44:02       dunning statistic. It's, it's disgusting. It's sad to see and it's, it's uh, you know, people who are a prisoner of their diet and that's most of it. And you know, exercise plays a factor for sure. It speeds up your metabolism, but the bottom line is you've got to stop eating shit and you've got to stop eating so much. But it's so satisfying to people, especially people that feel, they just feel like unsatisfied and unfulfilled and unhappy and they're medicating themselves with food cause they get this little charge every time they stuff a cake down their mouth or they eat a sandwich or they eat a giant bowl of unhealthy stuff.

Speaker 5:          02:44:40       I feel like you're going to break out into being Kevin Spacey in the movie seven where he goes out killing people who rather gloss slava slava glove and it the way you're speaking with such a disdain towards the glutinous sad cause it's not. It's not necessary, right?

Speaker 4:          02:44:56       This is a disease that you're giving yourself, right? This is what's sad. It's like, and I understand if you don't have an education on this and some people don't, but that's not the case with most people. Most people understand that what they're eating is bad for them. They do it anyway.

Speaker 5:          02:45:12       Well, which shows you that it's not only about you, you don't do bad things simply because you did annoy anybody. Yeah, for sure. Well, psychology is very human. Psychology is so unbelievably complicated and that's why I love my life. That's why I love my profession. Every day I wake up and I'm in a playground, what's the next problem that I'm going to tackle and have fun studying? That's why I love my life and I hope everybody, I often get people who write to me and say, what's the secret? Why are you always smiling? I'm always smiling. Well, number one, I'm healthy. I have a great family, but I wake up every day excited about the prospects for the day. If you could find that half the battle is won. Well you, you were

Speaker 4:          02:45:50       position, your life, your, your, your study is so, it's so rich with information and it's so illuminating in terms of like why certain things occur in our culture, why people do certain things, like what's the motivation and, and, and your perspective on like knowing

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       all these motivations and knowing what's causing all of these different actions and reactions. And it's gotta be just constantly interesting because it is so much. And I get to meet guys like who, and hung out with guys like hugh. Great thing about my job is I get to meet guys like you and learn all this cool shit. Thank you buddy. Listen, tell everybody about your show. It's on youtube to sad truth saturates s a a d truth. You could follow me on twitter at g a d s a a d and also I've got a public facebook page. Write me emails. Say Hello. Good to see my brother next time I see you going to be a fucking lethal weapon. Indeed. 30 pounds less. Bye everybody. See you soon.
