Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Went back, it was a mess. Ladies and gentlemen, we uh, we tried to, to come back online. I was trying to put up a, a, an image of a me and David Lee Roth and a, what the fuck ever. Firefox crashed on me, but I was trying to show you the, the face. We're all back, right? Everything's good. I'm gonna. Um, try to unload it through here.

Speaker 2:          00:00:32       It's liquor also has a nice side desktop loader you should download sometime. Oh, just dragged into it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       Oh really? Yeah. Okay. I'll get that shit. She put the picture up right now. I think today is the last day of Firefox. Firefox can suck it

Speaker 2:          00:00:50       if it's gotten bad lately. Have noticed. Chrome's been really good. I've been crashing a fucking lot with firefox. Like why I stop using it. Yeah. Okay. We're back. Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize. Apologize. Saved though. So if you are just coming in now, the first hour and a half is already saying, oh, that's annoying, right? It's better

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       if I have a white thing on my screen because it acts as a light look. Oh look, there's a light on. But it's not a light, it's just a little window open. I'm so clever. Make it so I can read your shit though.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       You know, if you gotta light behind your monitor, it actually eases your eyes and puts less strain on your eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       Dr Ross, Dr Oz real Dr Phil. Yeah, Firefox does blow your ride. We're using safari right now and all you fucking silicons that. Especially the. All these fucking MCA. A Ph. d dot Dot garbage. Oh, it's the same guy over and over again. And Nicole van, 2009. You are dumb. Okay. You're dumb. You're a dumb person. This whole Mac versus pc thing. What do you give a fuck? And you're telling me that pcs are somehow or another better than Max. Guess what? Douchebag. Pcs Get viruses. Max, don't. It's. That's why you bring me one dude who's ever had a virus on his fucking Mac one. I know everyone I know who's had a pc except food and chicken. He claims to have never gotten a virus. That's a lie. That's a lie. Everybody gets viruses on pcs. Just that alone. It's better to get a Mac. Second of all, Max, don't fucking crash nearly as much.

Speaker 1:          00:02:43       This wasn't a Mac problem is a firefox problem. Everything else on the computer work fine. That's why I was able to reboot. Listen, stop worrying about Mac versus pc. It's just a goddamn operating system. It's like the Republicans versus the Democrats. Most of the people on one side or the other or just on a fucking team and they're simple little brains are stuck on that team. They might not even agree with half the shit the Republican say, but they support them and even say, well, we got to support our team. You know, I don't agree with they're doing right now, but what's important is we support them and we know push forward and we get a Republican office 12, blah blah, blah. They're just the Washington redskins versus the fucking Miami Dolphins. That's all that shit is. It's teams. It's just like Boston versus Philly. Philly soaks posted rules. That's the same ironic bullshit. All right there. There is no fucking philly. There is no Boston. It's nonsense. You're a dummy. Shut the fuck up.

Speaker 3:          00:03:36       All right. How dare you. Where was I? Anyway? Did you have to that photo? Of course I did it. It's not on there. I dare you.

Speaker 4:          00:03:45       Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:03:47       I swear to God I pressed that thing. They all also up quick. It is though. Oh, so beautiful. They just told me that they're upgrading my download speed, like 30 megs next month. My case. Thanks.

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       I don't even have 20. I have like I think 16 or 18. 18 inside last time it said 18 to picture David Lee Roth

Speaker 4:          00:04:08       to do too.

Speaker 3:          00:04:15       Mother fucker.

Speaker 4:          00:04:19       That's hilarious.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       This is what caused all the fucking trouble. Ladies and gentlemen, a Goddamn picture of me and David Lee Roth, but it was just approved that Brian has been making this crazy ba phase for years because this picture David Lee Roth was like, what is it like from 2005,

Speaker 3:          00:04:37       three or four years ago before we got banned from the comedy or the whole time? The store thing? Yeah. Because it was at the comedy store. Right. So that's 2006 maybe. It was right before he got together with back together with van Halen before they announced that they were going to get back together. He was telling us about it though.

Speaker 4:          00:04:56       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:03       All right. I just put it on my little twitter. Um, and then you see Brian in the background making that crazy face. He did that your bullshit fucking hundreds of thousands of times. That was a long odyssey just to get one picture, but it really wasn't worth it. Epic fail indeed deed. Everybody's always talking about that. And no key fan got fella tryout, chat roulette. You know what I would think about doing that. But I don't want to see any dudes car

Speaker 3:          00:05:32       randomly. I did it. I tried it out. But uh, uh, I found this, this of somebody already did this before, but I found this a big black chick and I put her on loop and then did it just this an recorded the screen and stuff, but it was like maybe 90 percent Cox and I was like, yeah, it's not even funny. I don't, I mean it's really sad that there's so many creepy people out there and every,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       well, you know what it's Jews that want to show their dicks at work and they just never get the opportunity. But they get at home and they're wearing a fucking wrestling mask and they go crazy. And this just suppression man. It's like Catholic school girls. Remember Catholic school girls. When you were a kid, there were always the biggest sluts, right? Yeah. Yeah. Why? Because they never seen the dick there. They're whisked away to some fucking magical place where only girls exist. They have all girl teachers and Shit and they're told the dicks are evil and they just can't wait to suck one. They can't wait. Those bitches can't wait. They can't wait to get up there. And I'm like, oh, I just want to do that for bidding thing. You know, it can suppress human beings, man.

Speaker 3:          00:06:32       I'd like to do it with maybe like a five year old girl on loop to sitting there going like this, you know, like that. And see if any of these guys with the A and like put it away or if they sit there, they will fucking love it. I think what we could record them and put them on Youtube, that's about it. That's if we get a fake loop of a little kid just sitting there going like is looking at the monitor and see if the guy immediately disconnect or if he sits there an extra couple of seconds. Well how does it work? They pull their dicks out immediately as soon as you log in. Yeah. What, what is right. It just automatically puts you in with a room with another person both on Webcam and do they have their dick out and instantly when I, when I was doing it was just guys stroking or so right when he went in there you're like okay, so that's what you should do. You should, we should get a video of like a five or six year old girl. Just freaking the fuck out from the beginning. So it only works in the guys that already beat, not frank, because otherwise we'd have to time it. Like Tyler, like normal, you know? And then going, oh my God. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And have our screen call the police, call the police. We didn't have any debt. We just had the on,

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       you know that kind of adult better. Better. Just call it freaked this motherfucker out. Yeah, because they can catch you. The freaky weird dudes are mostly straight gay. Get Sex all the time. We are less repressed. Right? Shut the fuck up. Let me tell you something. Everyone's fucked up. Don't you tell me the days or less repressed course you more repressed society. Represses gay sex gays are just as fucked up as religion. Reply repressing straight sex and a lot of gays grew up in religious households too and that makes them extra fucked up there. It's not like a coincidence that gay people do so much crystal meth and there's so many gay people that loved to party and their lives become a reckoning fucking towards their immune system. Gay People. There's a lot of crazy fucking gay people and not repressed. Doesn't always mean that you're not fucked up.

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       I mean, how about bug chasers? How about gay dudes that are purposefully trying to get aids? You know that gay dudes who purposely try to get HIV, they want to get it and they think there's something hot about it, and so they go and have unprotected sex on purpose, hoping to get HIV. That's fucked up. You know, you can't say that gay people are fucked up sexually than straight people. Everyone's fucked humans across the board universally are fucked up. It's just way too difficult to come out and have you shared together. I mean, how many people really have their shit together? If you had a gas, the numbers one channel and really has no, but I mean have your shit together to a point where you know, like, oh, he's not doing anything. Self destructive is being productive and positive. It's like maybe one out of 100 men maybe out of the people that you meet.

Speaker 1:          00:09:24       One out of 100. The other 99 are nuts. You know, half nuts. Partially nods. You're nuts. I'm nuts with both nuts. You know what I mean? How many. I mean even the Dalai Lama is fucking nuts. You know what the Dalai Lama said? He called? He said that oral and anal sex, we're, we're um, I forget, I forget the exact word turns. He used sexual deviations or something like that, but he was saying, well I forget the term that the Dalai Lama used, but basically he was saying that oral sex is really bad. It's terrible for you. Didn't do it like you shouldn't be putting. The girls love it. It feels good and I like doing it. Right. You like doing. Yeah, we've talked about is that there's actually, there's actually science now saying that it can cause cancer and in the person that's eating out the grown out or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:11       Are you fucking member? We talked about this once. We've talked to science? No, we never talked about eating pussy. Yeah, we made a video. We made a video about it where I talked about eating pussy and we were talking about it in that video, but we didn't say eating pussy gives you. Yeah, it was something that came out and we were talking about how you like to lock out of it, like a slug. I know and that's how we started with that. I don't remember eating Pussy Jersey cancer. Dude. I think he might've just made that up. No oral sex please. Twitter verse. Tell me. Sweet Jesus, please, please, please tell me that you don't get. There was some kind of study that I'm eating. Oral sex increases throat cancer risks. Serious scientists say no, that's for girls because due to have fucking Dick Ward shoved their dick and the girl's mouth and the girl's mouth gets infected.

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       Like if you have the human papillomavirus that goes both ways. Um, girls and guys can both get the HPV virus from eating pussy. Yeah, that's chicks because you're mixing up with fucking blood in there. You know, you might get a clot back there in the corner that gets inside of open sore in your mouth. Ever done. That does sort of make sense. You know, oral sex can cause throat cancer. March ninth, 2000. So it Kinda sucks because that's my favorite thing to do. So I moved on to this. It's just fuck son, what's wrong with you? Boy Tamica here for 43, but we were down for 10 minutes. So who's this one dummy? It keeps saying, have I ever Shit my pants? You know, there's something wrong with you as a human

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       being if you keep asking the same stupid fucking question over and over and over again, like the same day. That's what's interesting to you. That's what's interesting to you. All right, let's go to war. We're going to go to forums dot Joe Rogan.net and see what the questions are. We put up a thread like we do it every week where

Speaker 4:          00:12:25       Peter

Speaker 2:          00:12:26       ask questions and shit. And then Dallas this weekend, Addison Improv. Well that's almost sold out. That's right. Bitches. So Friday is almost sold out late show. Saturday night is sold out. There's only a 40 or 50 tickets left for a bowl shows Friday inside or both shows on Friday and the first show on Saturday. So it. So now quit. So if you want to come to Dallas by the time we get on the radio, when we get on the radio, it's going to sell quick. We're going to do lex and Terry and a couple other radio stations. So that's, you know, if you want to jump on it, you gotta jump on it now. When are you going to get your tattoo? A new one. It's going to start in April. I'm getting into the skinny bitch thought started. What? I want to get covered up online. We're giving you a cap on top of that because that you're crazy. Explosion. Cat. What? The Japanese. You know that Carol? I'm going to go. I'm going to go and get this lasered off. Lasered. Yeah. This one, the old one I have up here because I'm doing the whole sleeve. But he'd be laser. There are no, you have to go to a clinic that doesn't. It hurts like a motherfucker but I tattoo. See, let's say you don't be a pussy.

Speaker 2:          00:13:39       Yeah. David did I ever tell them uh, what, what, how I found out what my tattoo about that whole thing. Tell us or show the tattoo first. Tell the whole time.

Speaker 3:          00:13:49       Okay. So when I was younger, I was a manager of a movie theater. One of my employees wanted to be a tattoo artist. While he tells the story, I'm going to pay, one of my employees wanted to be a tattoo artist and she, her boyfriend owned a tattoo studio, so the whole time, uh, she's like, you know, he's teaching me every day how to do tattoos and I do it on like watermelons or something like that to practice and she's been doing it forever. And finally one day she's like, you know what, I'm ready. Start doing tattoos now. So if you know anyone that needs a tattoo, and she's like, I'll hook them up. And I go, wow, how much are you charging? And she's like, for you, I'll, you know, I'll do it for free or something like that because you will be my first person to ever do it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:27       So I'm like, thinking free tattoo. That's awesome. So I went there, it took her eight hours or something ridiculous to do this tattoo. And it originally was supposed to be an Egyptian turtle with a my name in Chinese or the letter R in Chinese, in the middle of the turtle in Chinese. It was some stupid. I was really stoned or whatever. And it hurts so bad she did nothing but scar me. So I have tons of scar tissue and it's like the gay is looking. Tattoo looks like Spiderman, you know, within a gang gang fight or something like that. Anyways, so anyways, uh, so one time I met this bar in the, this Chinese girl both let me see that tattoo. And she goes, why do you have that on your arms? She really talk like that. It was worse than that. She had a cock in her mouth, but she, uh, she looked at it and she goes, let me see that. And she goes, why do you have that on your arm? I'm like, what are you talking about? That's an orange Chinese, my last name, blah, blah, blah. She goes, that's not an rn. She's, that's like flowing water. That's like a waterfall. Do you like waterfalls? So I guess my tattoo means water from again. So gay. Anyways, I was thinking about getting the, getting the, the. You know how there's a cats in Chinese restaurants? Yeah. They have a clock. That could be like the clock.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       Yes. I'll have Aaron dove the Dover from grew tattoo. We'll do it together. That'd be awesome. Or we'll have someone else. Girl, they have seven fucking killer artists. He can recommend. Somebody will have them drawn. Honky. I got my tattoo done at Guru Tattoo in San Diego and they're awesome. Killer artists. My God. You got it. Did me as Aaron Dellavedova and he only does big giant pieces. He did my whole sleeve. Fifty hours. We went down there I think seven times. Right?

Speaker 3:          00:16:11       But that's going to be the same. We still do this. They're going to do. We're going to do this. They're too. We're going to do that again. And

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       Yeah, we've got. So we're gonna do a Brian's uh, will, will find you a good artist there, man. He's got a killer staff of killer artists. Donkey Kong still there because I wear a shirt every day that he is. I bet he is. We could find out. No gear attack. When does red band start stripping Edward Cat flap all high flaco hello? Kitty is worse than waterfalls. It's not the hello kitty man. How dare you, Bro? Hello Kitty. I didn't think good luck had it. Didn't take a bump. I peed. I've never done a bumper of my life. It's one of the few drugs that have never done. There's a bunch of them that I've never done. I've never done anything addictive. There's hockey hung in there in front of artists. They had a budget killer artists. Man, that place is awesome. It's in Pacific beach, down in San Diego.

Speaker 1:          00:17:02       Again. Still works there. And I worked on. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think that guy lost his marbles. Um. Anyway. Well, what the fuck we're talking about tattoos? No shopping. Doing cocaine in the bathroom. I've never done a coke. I've never done coke any ever because when I was in high school, my friend Jimmy has cousin of selling coke shouldn't even send my friend who let you fucking gas. But uh, he was selling it and um, when he was doing that he lost all this weight and he fucking who would like hide in the basement or in the attic rather. And just, they would do coke and watch TV and him and his girlfriend, which is zombies. And I saw his whole life fall apart, like I watched it happen and I remember like saying that fucking stuff's bad for you. I just remember nothing but bad things from high school and, and you know, right after high school have people in coke just like, it was very obvious to me. That was like the worst thing you could do. Nitrous? No. Oh, like from whippets did it once, once when I worked at a ice cream place, I didn't like it. Just give me a headache.

Speaker 1:          00:18:10       We used to go, I'm done Mtma. So they asked me if I done it. I did ecstasy once, only one time and it was awesome, but the next day was so bad. The next day I was so stupid. My brain was like, it felt like a sponge than had been wrung out dry and then just left in the sun, you know? And then you try to like clean something with it. It was just like, it was so my brain was so dumb. It just, I, I was feeling so bad the next day I was like, this cannot be good for you. It's got to be fucking terrible for you. Who knows what it was in it though. It might not have just been mdm, a pure Mtma. It might've been like they say that people cut it with speed and shit like that, you know? But anyway, I couldn't read the next day. That guy read Rehm show gallery. Rem Shoe Gallery. Yeah. I couldn't read the next day, man. Literally I was sitting in a starbucks and I was trying to read a magazine and I was like, I can't even fucking concentrate on us. I couldn't literally couldn't focus. It was. It was bad. Know. It was a fucking great time though. That night. I can understand why people do it and I guess if you're not a big reader, you don't mind feeling stupid. The next day wouldn't be a problem, but for me, man, I've talked to people say there's no the next day they feel. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:19:26       fine. It just depends on how it's like strychnine in it and stuff like that. If you ever candy flipped where it's a piece of candy and has ecstasy on one side and acid on the other side of her. That's crazy though. It's a great combo. Yeah. Yeah. But I've heard it's like whenever you combine things like that, the recovery times just accelerated even more time. I want to do it nowadays.

Speaker 1:          00:19:51       So what else? What's the best weed? The best weed is the weed that you got. Bitch, you know, if you don't have the options. See, the beautiful thing about California is this, um, there, that guy's fucking deal with that guy, man. That's the perfect style. Her style. I could totally see that guy doing it. Adam Hawthorne. Um, I think, um, the thing that's cool about California is the fact that you get to go these places and experiment with all these different strains with Joel Diaz mixes it up every day. He thinks that that's that shit. Was that right there? Joey Diaz thinks that tiger looks like, Ooh. Joey Diaz thinks they should make sure we meet up every day. We're on guru tattooed.com

Speaker 3:          00:20:38       g you are, you tattoo. Joey

Speaker 1:          00:20:41       says that if you smoked the same weed every day, get used to it, but if you mix up strains everyday, the everyday it's like boom. So Joey buys like a little bit of weed every day. It's like a ritual. Smoke weed everyday you get used to it. I mean I have to take a good three days off nowadays, but she always made sure that every day I try not to smoke weed everyday. Joe Ain't taking no days off, you know, when you go when we're on the road and we'd pass by Joey's hotel room, like we're all staying in the same hotel. When you go to get joey, his room stinks of weed. I mean fucking stinks everyday. It's thinks a week. He always knows the right guy in every town to get him. We'd, you know. And he always gets it. Joey's in everyday we'd go, I own, I don't smoke weed everyday. I like to take days off. I think it, uh, it's better. Like I don't like the, I don't like being completely obliterated every day now. I don't think that's just healthy.

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       All right, let's go to the questions on the message board. Oh, you're Charlotte North Carolina. Date changed. It changed or a venue changed to did it. Is it now? It's a south and a most south end. Okay. Whatever. There were a therefore a UFC. So the way it always works is whenever I'm in town for UFC, I always do a Gig the day before.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       Let's go to the message board. I did a Gig in Sydney, had a great fucking time. Australian people are the shit that show was fun man, but the show was. Could, could have been better because I got too drunk the night before. Oh, we got too drunk. My brain was, first of all, I was fucked up because I could not sleep because you're 19 hours ahead when you go to Australia, so your body doesn't know what time it was. I'd be exhausted. I go to sleep three hours later I'd wake up and I didn't know what I thought I was taking a nap. Like my body had no idea. I could not sleep for like eight hours of the session. I couldn't do it. So it sleep like three hours, get up. I try to read at beat off. I tried to go back to sleep again, that sleep for another hour and I'd wake up again.

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       Like it was so confusing that. But um, Friday night and we got there. It was um, me and uh, Eddie and um, who else? Thompson, Thompson Guerra. Me and Eddie and Thompson. Boy. We went to a bar and God fucking blitzkrieg we just pulled up to the bar. We, we, we, we set up shop like, right, right by the bar at this club and just start buying people drinks. She just went nutty. I must've bought a hundred fucking drinks. Just appointing drinks cheaper or all the same? It's very close. It's like 92, two. Our dollar. A consorted. Ninety two cents or might've been the other option might be to. I'm not sure which one, but uh, people are so. See any kangaroos anywhere. Yeah, we did at the zoo. Depressed, depressed. Kangaroos. Just laying around like this motherfucker. That's what we were talking about earlier. We were talking about the killer whale to kill people.

Speaker 1:          00:23:43       Yeah. Just a disease. Bummed me the fuck out man. I would like to see Kangaroos in the wild, but they're dangerous. They'll fuck you up. Was there anything Australia that was just completely insane, like their bathrooms have weird no lights and it's like, you know, you grow up. We were talking about this being Eddie and Tom about how, you know, when you grow up, you're taught that everything sucks except America. Soccer Australia is the shit. I mean, it's beautiful. It's clean. Really Nice houses everywhere. The restaurants were great, the people were friendly, you know, the economy's not completely fucked. You're driving on the left side of the road, which is weird. But other than that you can use that. What's the difference? You know, it's just what you're used to. But other than that, it's fucking phenomenal. I mean, other than that, what a great country man.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       I mean, it's amazing. And comics like, um, my friend Eddie gift, he's huge over there. Huge guys sells out all over the place. Does TV shows people come to see him that he can. He's told me they write about them in the paper when he was at a bar, but in America you can't, can't fucking get traction for whatever reason. Some UFC that was great use arch Barker's gigantic in Australia. Fucking monstrous. He sold out someplace. Supposedly it was like a 1500 seat place. Sold it out. Something like 20 something nights in a row. I mean, just craziness. They love American comedians over there. So the show was fucking fantastic. I had a great time. Few people walked out, but that's going to happen and if you don't know what you're getting into, you know, I always try to tell people that if there was a big sign in the front of the show that said, warning, this show will contain language and material as extreme as you could possibly imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:25:26       But apparently some of the shit I said people couldn't imagine. So they didn't know what to expect but I'm sorry you bummed out, but I'm 99 percent of the people that have a great fucking time. But yeah, it was pretty wild. Crazy show. But also it was because we were hammered that night too. So two nights in a row we got barbecued, so I was planning on going to Australia and doing all this. Writing the alcohol just sticks a fork and all those plans. You know, you, you said that when he flew to Australia it's like 17 hours whereas the flight really did it really feel like 17 hours because at the point where you were just like, fuck this, I need to jump off this plane. This is too much or no, no, no, it wasn't that bad. You know, you just a cancer fighting, you know, you just, you've read, watch a fucking movie.

Speaker 1:          00:26:11       Get on your laptop. I was going over some material on the way over there. The real problem was once I got there I thought I was going to write, but it was just so it was all get drunk, recover from the drunk. A lot of water. Construct again, recover. You have like small little bedrooms. All Nos on the plane, right? Claim was doped. We flew first class on Quantis and then some think it's called the 80 3:10 or something like that. Giant ass fucking plane. And they're huge man. They're the, the, the like, it's like a little apartment man, wisdom like coach, like, like, uh, don't know, two times,

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       three times. Coaches are spoken coach you business classes,

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       pretty dope business classes just as good as first class. Wow. Pretty close to it. But coach walk you, they say tax.

Speaker 3:          00:26:56       I'd been like, Hey, let me hang out in your bedroom up here. I can't imagine flying 16 hours from one of these. Ask chairs. Just jam next. Ralphie may on one side and Kevin Smith and the other after they ran a marathon, I can't believe that somebody actually. Kevin Smith

Speaker 1:          00:27:14       dumber. You do not know who he. I guess a lot of people don't know who he is. Like the way he looks like they don't know that that's all. That's that famous director. You might want to shut the fuck up that guys on twitter all day every day. He probably ruined southwest. That cost them money for sure. Don't you think?

Speaker 3:          00:27:31       Well, part of me thinks so. But then the other part of me is like, they just got so much attention, you know? And especially if you hate fat people, you'd be like, fuck you, I'm going to southwest. So they lost the fat dollar. I bet there's a lot of fat people have got bummed out. How's Ralphie may fly southwest because he it. You know how much money that probably saved them. All these pissed off fat people aren't flying southwest now. Just save them. There's already studies that they were thinking this is ridiculous. They were thinking about making you take a shit before you flew because they've found out that if they made everyone go to the bathroom before they got on the airplane, that they would say so many dollars per year. Like this was a real study that they were going into southwest. This wasn't southwest system is American Airlines or something like that. So can you imagine now that they have all these fat people pissed off that we're not going to fly southwest. It's probably, they're probably earning $5, million dollars a year.

Speaker 1:          00:28:21       Cost them more to fly, like fuel wise to Australia for a fat guy then for electricity.

Speaker 3:          00:28:27       Oh, I'm sure it's big enough times 100 then that than you would imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       Oh my God. Huh? Yeah. Kind of makes sense.

Speaker 3:          00:28:36       Maybe. Maybe southwest paid Kevin Smith and theirs is all just to save them a million. A couple million a year. I would never do. It's like the integrity. I met him. He was

Speaker 1:          00:28:47       cool. It wouldn't do that. He is really cool. He's a nice guy. I met him when I came into k rock once. Care Cue in La. Very fun radio. The last of the terrestrial radio stations in our La fucking radio in La has vanished. I'm wanting to do radio for a long time. I was thinking about doing it, you know, I was thinking, wow, what a cool thing that would be. Like we have some interesting conversations. You take callers, talk to people online and shit, you know, but it just died when they had that 97 point one FM talk. I was like, how cool would that be? Let's get out. Let's get on the fucking radio gig and now let's do.

Speaker 3:          00:29:25       Well. You were going to do it in Denver. He repeated it back. Yeah, I was thinking about doing it in Denver and I was thinking when you go back to Denver,

Speaker 1:          00:29:30       keep it will keep on asking me that. Well this UFC in March, but um, I haven't gotten a venue to do standup app so I might just go back and I'm. No, no, no, stand up. Just have fun. Just do the UFC. I want to go back and check out my house and see if I can find a fucking mountain lion that ate my dog.

Speaker 3:          00:29:47       When you came here and your dog was sitting on the front porch, he's been living off the land and he's this big butch lassie looking dog now

Speaker 1:          00:29:57       and got Jack, believe me, he was gone for weeks. There's no way your dog does not appreciate black peoples peoples. Well, if dogs are around black people and then also they see a black person, they're like, what the fuck? Why did you that color? What's going on? Can Dog see color? They just see darkness. Don't dogs see in black and white? Maybe you think it's a dude with a mask on.

Speaker 4:          00:30:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:23       Oh, okay. Gentlemen, let's go to a the message Conan, Conan O'brien as a new look with the beard. Well, you know what, he's got $35 million in the bank now. It's just kicking it. You know, today I interviewed a squirrel in my backyard and then through to commercial, somebody helped me.

Speaker 3:          00:30:46       That's

Speaker 1:          00:30:48       pretty Tony and Brian now as a twitter. By the way, it's Conan O'brien. The I love the whole Conan store. It just shows you how retarded networks are, you know, and first of all they should have never changed shit, you know what they should've done. I appreciate the Jimmy Fallon people enjoy Jimmy Fallon's show, but you know what? Put that on after Conan O'brien, you know, go back to the way you had it. Don't be stupid. You want to go Jay Leno tonight show while you want to go middle America, throw softballs and not offend anybody, and then keep the Conan O'brien show where it was because we'd Conan's on. He can do, you know all that craziness, the fucking insult dog masturbating. But you can do it late at night because you're allowed to do more crazy shit late at night. You know what's his face went? Remember when we were talking to norm Macdonald's outside the ice house. He had the best point norm. Mcdonald goes. He goes, well, I can never make one time. He's on anyway. Nobody watches it and watch it on your dvr. Yeah, yeah, yeah. See It on Youtube. Who Cares? Rianna 1130 or 1230. It's 12 years better is you can get away with more shit.

Speaker 3:          00:31:51       He was totally right. I like how you're saying all this, but yeah, his phone was from 1982, so as I have it on the phone at all. When I, when I ran out,

Speaker 1:          00:32:01       Jim, I ran into dawn Mcdonald once when I was doing some Canadian gigs like uh, a couple of years ago. And when I ran into him, he didn't have a cell phone. I had to call his home phone.

Speaker 3:          00:32:09       That's right. It never fucking cell phone. He didn't have one because I don't want people to just be able to get in touch with me. Fuck off. Disappear. Know that dude.

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       Yeah, he's hilarious man. He's a norm. Macdonald hosted a talk show would be the shit. Yeah, that would be. I would, I would tune into that talk show because he wouldn't let get people get away with anything. You know? He's, he's nuts. You know, he's, he's a loose dude. He's wild.

Speaker 3:          00:32:35       You'd be a good couch guy for like Conan because have you ever seen him on the couch? Like, I forget

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       who it was in the whole time. He was like cracking jokes. That was awesome. Wasn't it would be a good like good side guy. Yeah. And you know like have like a straight guy and then he gets the side guy. What is my take on the weed stores in La? Getting raided. It fucking sucks. You know, the whole thing makes me, it makes me sick. You know, the whole thing is so, so strange, man. It's so strange that they're still fucking with people. Apparently the way the law is presented though, and California and I, I'm not sure this, um, is that they believe that the way the law is presented is that you can give weed away and you can sell it as long as you're not making a profit and that these collectives are supposed to be to provide medical patients with marijuana. But apparently there's people out there that are flaunting the wealth and they're making a fuck load of money off of it.

Speaker 1:          00:33:35       Millions and millions of dollars off selling wheat. Now, if that's the case, there's two parts of me, one part of me that says, well, you know what? Fuck you, they should be able to sell it. You know, you're, you guys are Douche bags. But another part of me says, hmm, maybe it'd be better. Maybe it would be really in the spirit of weed. If it was free, maybe you really would be in the spirit of weed that it isn't, that there isn't a for profit. You know, people will don't, man, these stores couldn't exist and they couldn't sell it. Yeah. But we, it's not that hard to grow them and people would still grow and sell weed and you know, people will sell it illegally. I mean, there would be plenty of people that would, you know, if you want good weed, you got to talk to this guy and it's expensive.

Speaker 1:          00:34:15       But I kinda liked the idea of it not being for profit. There's something about it, uh, that, that bugs me, that people are overcharging for this plant just because it's illegal and it's fucking, some places it's super expensive, you know, five, $600 an ounce for like really powerful, potent weed, you know, which I understand that God should get paid for is growing and this and that and I totally respect that. You should be able to make a certain amount of money for it. But if it was legal, it would be way fucking cheaper than it is right now. The reality is the reason why it's expensive at all, the reason why these guys can make millions of dollars in profit off of selling weed is only because it's illegal and difficult to get and you have to get it from these places. If marijuana was legal and you could grow your own, which is how it should be, you would have no need to buy it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:00       You could have a little fucking plant your backyard or in my closet is like that, but it's not. This guy got fucking arrested. It's not. This guy just got arrested. This guy just got arrested with 24 different counts and he's going to charge him and the way it works apparently is what Obama has said is that they're not going to charge people who were, who were only violating federal law federally. It's illegal. They're going to go after people who are going to violate both the federal and state laws. So you have to follow the state law to the letter and they're making an example out of this one dude. Apparently. Well, I mean if you go and get a license, you're allowed to grow white seven or something like

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       that. Yeah, you're allowed to grow a lot. You're allowed to have like a half a pound of weed and get the other license that you can do up to like 21 plants. So I got that. Yeah, you have that. For some reason they asked me if I need an exemption, but I said what's an exemption for? He goes, well, you know, the regular amount of weed is not enough. Although yes, the regular amount is not enough. I need more. You could pretty much anyone, anyone can get back. Even even kids could probably get this shit, but if they can get that license. So if you just grow within your amount, you could pretty much do that now. And even if the cops came over your house, right. But it could be people that don't have the room to grow and they don't want to be hassled and they want to be able to go out and purchase it at a reasonable rate.

Speaker 2:          00:36:21       And I agree that there is a reasonable rate. But right now the rate is so high that marijuana is worth more than gold. Marijuana is worth more, worth more per pound than gold is. That seems a little crazy. You know, I mean, it's definitely inflated because of the fact that there's no competition because of the fact that it's illegal and it's so fucking plant. It should be legal. Everybody should be able to grow it. And if it was legal, there would be nobody making millions and millions of dollars off of. The real problem is it would fuck the economy up because pharmaceutical companies, which is fucking nosedive, there'd be so many different pharmaceutical products. That would be that there would be useless. I, you know, I believe that to a point, but right now I have, we whenever I want have wheat, but I still have Tom's for my stomach.

Speaker 2:          00:37:05       I still have aspirin for headaches, you know, they didn't replace any. You don't have fucking glow coma dude. You know, there's a lot of different medications for add. There's a lot. Those are the billion dollar medicines. It's not tom's Bro. But you know what description and most of these people that are saying that it's the best drug for a glaucoma and stuff are just hippies wanting. We'd to be illegal because if you. If you look at them, the medication for Glaucoma in comparison, I bet you it's better than not. It is the best for interocular pressure. I believe that it's what's called when, when Glaucoma. Apparently it's very painful for people and marijuana apparently is the best at relieving that. It's the best ever restoring people's appetite when they have chemotherapy. That's why cancer patients like it. It's the best at it. Suppressed that a lot of different things do.

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       There's people that have had kids that have autism. There's a video that we showed them that clip that autism and that was the only thing that calm the kid down, made him normal was we'd, you know, it's great for a lot of different things and all those different things are prescription drugs that are worth fucking billions of dollars every year to pharmaceutical companies, which is why they lobby against recreational drugs, so called recreational drugs. It's just why to this day partnership for drug free America to this day gets money from pharmaceutical companies. They got money from alcohol companies and tobacco companies, millions and millions of dollars in the past and because of that there was a lot of criticism so they no longer get money from alcohol and tobacco companies, but they still get money from pharmaceutical companies and pharmaceutical

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       companies are responsible for oxycodone, Vicodin, percocet, all that shit. I still don't think it's going to be like if they made it legal, like all these companies are going go out of business. I know my mom's not going to be smoking weed. She's gonna. Be like, no, I'll take. The other thing would be dumb enough for a few generations. Yeah, there would be dominoes we just doesn't work with and that's like that's percent 60 percent is that in exchange for the things that we do

Speaker 1:          00:39:00       talked about, it's not 50 or 60 percent will weed is a real effective medicine for a bunch of different things, but more importantly it be great for textiles. It would be great for. You can eat it. You can. I mean, it has all the essential fatty acids and the seeds, you know, amino acids. There's a lot of different fucking things that marijuana is good for besides just just getting you high. Right. It's incredible that it's illegal. It's really mind blowing that it's illegal, but in 2010 with the access to information than we have today, the fact that it's still illegal. That's fucking insane, man. Because you streamed laggy. Yeah. You streams always laggy, man. Anything on the Internet slab you'd. Nothing works perfect. This is fucking. The Internet is in a stage right now. It's not done yet. The irs plane crash or guy having a hanger coal leased by Member of Homeland Security and having ties to intelligence agencies.

Speaker 3:          00:39:55       Is that true? Well, I know that he stole that plane, so I don't know. It wasn't his plane. If that's what you're talking about. Oh, you know what? I'm all for that guy because what's your offer that granite crashes building is planning. Anyone die in that? Yes. All right. Fuck the irs. Wow. I'm still dealing with them. Bullshit.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       They're like fucking bullet. Okay. This bad, bad, bad. Bobby's telling me that gold is $1,100 an ounce in a British Columbia and the best weed is $3,200 a pound and eight more than gold. It's going for less than $17,000 a pound here in the US. Oh, I stand corrected. Thank you very much, sir.

Speaker 3:          00:40:38       That sounds better. That sounds better now the way I said. Yeah, I know what's worth more than gold.

Speaker 1:          00:40:44       Cash Hash is worth more than gold, isn't it? Damn Hash is expensive as fuck. How much is a pound of Hash? Go for more than an hour and a half by half ass. Fucking punch a hole through to another dimension to measure. We smoked a pound of Hash Hash. They make out a weed somehow or another. I'm known as the president to do it. So resin the resin. How do they do it though? Do you know how they make it? A bit of a complicated process, but I've had it before and it's very deep. It's a strange high. It's very, very good.

Speaker 3:          00:41:14       Mr. Strong. I might do opium again. Opens you did opium? Fuck yeah. It's not much different than ash. Really? Yeah. It looks a little like no heroin. No, no. It's like a. It looks like a piece of soap. It smokes like a smokes. Smokes like hash in it. It smells like a Hippie, like petroleum. It smells like Petroli when it burns real. Yeah. It's, it's kind of like, I dunno, like a hash kind of feeling.

Speaker 1:          00:41:47       Hm. I'm scared man. Yeah. The gold thing. I didn't really research that way. Well, it was something else. Sorry, I said that incorrectly. There's something else that, that marijuana was more expensive than per ounce. It was oil. Does that make sense? Worth more than oil. I'm worth more than something that's worth a lot. Uh, let's go with some other questions here. Dan, with the USTREAM powerful ustream. Opium smells like flowers and it's super addictive from the poppy faggot. While you're doing something super addictive. Brian's already addicted. Addicted. Brian had had a hangnail and that got them to start smoking again.

Speaker 3:          00:42:33       No, it was. And I got audited by the irs for that. As you cat got a hangnail no, now that was my cat. Had a fucked up foot Canada, his cabinet, Canada fucked up. Fuck, fucking can't take it anymore. Cigarettes because cigarettes out of nowhere, you'll be like, dude, I need a cigarette. I need a cigarette. And it's one of those things. Once you do it, it opens up a door that's always gonna. Be Open and it's weird. Cigarettes or this guy did you know you can add to that

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       late your pineal by saying the word love at a certain frequency.

Speaker 3:          00:43:06       Shut up, shut the fuck up. Just like that. Shot up like the new Mariah Carey Song is, has a high enough pitch to open up your garage doors. No, it doesn't,

Speaker 1:          00:43:18       but loves to say stupid people love fucking magic. They love magic and nonsense. You know, they love to think that there is like something like that. There's real magic. The real magic. Eat a pound of mushrooms. The magic, instead of having a 16 ounce steak have 16 ounces of mushrooms. Motherfucker. Shit, that's magic. You know? Yeah. You will magically be retarded for the rest of your life. You'll probably be communicating with aliens permanently. You'll probably be locked into another dimension. You know, tell Jerry Garcia smoking opium wasn't addicted addicted. He moved to smoking black tar heroin after that. Well, it's for sure. Did they used to have an opium dens back in the wild west? Don't you remember?

Speaker 3:          00:44:06       But I never wanted it open the next day thought about, oh my God, I need it. You know, it was never like that. Cocaine was kind of like that. But for me by that opiod never was like that. That was more of like a treat like a dessert.

Speaker 1:          00:44:18       Well, you know, there's a good argument because this argument was on the message board as well. People were talking about things being addictive and hit. The problem with even alcohol being addictive is that it's not addictive. Everybody, you know, I'm not addicted to. I could, I could not have a drink every day for the rest of my life and I'd have no problem with that. But I like to have a drink sometimes and go on stage. I like to have a drink sometimes my buddies just to make things fun. Just makes you get crazy. You pay for it the next day though. Especially rh. Yeah, man, you get older, do you pay for it more? But the bottom line is it's not addictive. Like I don't, I don't hurt when I don't have it, but for some people it is. Some people have to have a drink. When I was doing construction, when I was a kid, there was a dude who had a mountain dew bottle and he would fill it up with fucking beer, just like cheap beer, like colt 45 and he would drink beer all day while we worked all day.

Speaker 1:          00:45:08       This guy was, he was shaky. Jones and Duke. He would show up for work though. He was there every fucking day. Seven in the morning swinging that hammer, you know, he was there pissing every five minutes. That was always hammered though. He was drinking beer all day for that dude though. I think it's like everybody's got their own biochemical makeup. It's like you're addicted to cigarettes. But like Thompson Thompson, guerra smoked cigarettes when he drinks but doesn't smoke other times and he can go years without cigarettes with no problem. But when he drinks he likes to have a cigarette. When was the last meeting went a year with no problem. Now. Well he's sending has taken a long time off. He's taking time off a bunch of times and he won't smoke for months and then he'll have a cigarette, they'll have a cigarette when he drinks. I definitely think cigarettes is like that one thing that even if you quit smoking, it can be three years later in avondale where they'll start smoking again.

Speaker 1:          00:45:55       No reason why. I know you said that as soon as red. So I, I think, you know, I think they're doing something. Remember that movie the insider with Russell Crowe or see that movie? Yeah. It was all about like all the shit that they do to cigarettes to make it even more addictive, like hundreds of different additives, hundreds of different additives just to make it more addictive. And I've, I totally believe that's true. Totally. One hundred percent believe that's true. And if that's the case, man, I mean who the fuck knows? I mean they say that cigarettes are more, it's not as dangerous as heroin because heroin will kill you quicker and you can overdose from it. But cigarettes will get you hooked quicker than anything, like apparently if you, if you have that thing inside you that gets you hooked to shit like that,

Speaker 3:          00:46:33       but I don't, but I that cigarettes do totally. He with cocaine too, you said? Well I almost, because I was selling it and getting a large amounts of it for free. You were allegedly allegedly selling really selling me. It's just like this is like a character that would buy a large amount so he could give it away and have some extra for free. It was Peter Pan of have. No, not Peter Pan. Robin Hood of cocaine was like one month of my life back in [inaudible] 94 in this fictional story. And it's takes an old story. But anyways, if you were rich, okay, what if you will, what if you like Jay z baller, you know, private jet rich and you could just get pure cocaine shipped right over here from the CIA. The CIA would drop it off on your doorstep. Well, I think I go back into the program.

Speaker 3:          00:47:20       I think the only reason it was kind of addictive to me because I am one of those people that never go to the doctors and I probably need to be one of those people that are on speed or something because I like having a thyroid. I like having a thyroid condition. Most of my day is spent like moping around energy and stuff like that. But uh, uh, when cocaine, I felt like I was alive for the first time and I think that's what was addictive more of just like I felt like I was out of some kind of coma. Well, sometimes, well sometimes I'm having like a normal day, like I'm not really into anything and I'll have a cup of coffee and God damn it, I just get fucking fired up. I. Right. Great. Yeah. I feel good about life. Fucking feels like the warm sun feels better to clean my office. We get a little fired up from stimulants, you know? Right. That's what they're there for. Yeah. You know, Cook it. I don't know what cocaine's like, but I know that I've had never stopped talking. You talked about this, you would be talking so fast, your jaw would fly off and hit somebody in the face. I have this

Speaker 1:          00:48:17       think called Martin the coca and it's a, it's a tea that's made out of a, I guess I'm talking to myself and our company, you, Monte to coco is a tea that's made out of a coca leaf. So it's like cocaine, the plant that they make cocaine from, but it's the unprocessed forum, which is, um, it's actually like indigenous people, a shoe that I think it's improved. They said it's like really common isn't approved. He doesn't know he's outside smoking cigarettes, talking to myself. Um, they, uh, they chew this leaf and it's um, for especially the people that, uh, are at high altitude, like a high altitude, a hurting communities, they, they eat this a true. This tea is tea leaf. But I had it in a tea form and when I had it, it was not good for me. I couldn't shut the fuck up.

Speaker 1:          00:49:04       Me and Doug, Stan hope are doing shrooms. It was the day the Iraq war started and we were in the middle of the desert at my friend house and it's pretty crazy because we're truman and right when the shrooms we're kicking in, we noticed on the television set that they were saying that the war coverage begins at five and Stan hope looked at me and he goes, there's a fucking kickoff for the war. I mean, that's really what it was like they were telling us when the war coverage is going to start tuning in at five or war coverage. It was like a kickoff. It was like, that's when the program, the war program was going to start and that's when this guy, John, my friend John, who's like, he's done more psychedelics than anyone I've ever met ever. He's definitely probably fried. His brains. Got a cool podcast though. Uh, but he was talking about, hey, take this motto to Coco. It'll help the mushrooms kick in quicker. Maybe it did, but I, I could not shut the fuck up. And I was telling Doug while I was doing it, I was like, I can't shut the fuck up. This is driving me crazy and he was laughing uncontrollably because he thought it was hilarious that I was talking about how I couldn't shut the fuck up yet aware of it, and

Speaker 3:          00:50:12       it's the worst, but you know what you would you would. That's one of those drugs that, thank God he never tried because you would freak out and love it because it makes your mind open up and just think so clear because you're just nonstop thinking of new stuff. Talk about. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       that's for me. That's how my friend Jimmy said that when we're kids, W W with the cousin, that was a problem with it. He told me not to do it. He taught you smell so bad. Dude. That is so nasty. Cigarettes are so funny. Aren't they? Kept on talking about it and daddy needed to taste. Daddy needed to tell you can't go two hours. He had a cigarette right when we started to buy. Oh, shut your fucking hole. You had your fix. How'd your goddamn fix 'em anyway, cigarettes. Bad Code and go. You know what though? What's interesting in California, I don't know if this is in all states that have changed cigarettes to go out by himself now, so if you don't, if you don't hit it long enough, it will just go out because of the fires out here reading the cigarette companies had to make something in a cigarette, so if you don't hit it after a while it will go out by itself and just makes me what is.

Speaker 2:          00:51:23       That can't be good. Probably doing something like that, man, they've probably made it extra addictive along the way and oh well we can do that, but unfortunately caused with psychotic episodes and make you fucking mortgage your house for extra cigarettes might start hoarding cigarettes. Right. You know, if they could figure out a way to put something in cigarettes that would make you completely insane and have this insane desire to collect cigarettes. Could you imagine if that started happening? Yeah, like a lot of black dudes collect sneakers. They have like you go into their house, I got yo MTV raps or MTV cribs rather, you know, you go in, they have like a whole room filled with sneaker hiding or jumped from somebody. They're junk was touched or it's, it's too big and they have a horse Cox and they want you to look at the fuck is he talking about?

Speaker 2:          00:52:08       He's like, no, they're just, for whatever reason they're into collecting shoes. What if people just started collecting cigarettes like according cigarettes, like roomfuls of cigarettes and cigarette companies are like, well, you know, we make a fantastic product. We can't help other people get excited about it. They're just excited about our product and we found out that they had added something to cigarettes that make people want to hoard cigarettes. They would totally do it if some fucking scientists came up with a, a formula where he could have a certain amount of chemicals and if you put those in cigarettes, people smoke cigarettes, they would have this insatiable desire to collect cigarettes and buy way more than they need. You don't think they would put that in the cigarettes? Of course they would. Fuck, yeah, they would do it. They didn't give a fuck about you. They sell shit that kills you.

Speaker 2:          00:52:53       They shit. They don't. It's not like they didn't know we didn't know. Cigarettes kill you. Holy Shit. We're going to stop. We're sorry. No cigarettes. Kill 400 fucking million people every year and no cigarette companies have even thought about slowing down and no politicians have ever thought about banning them. You never hear a peep out of politicians. All those faggots want to talk about fucking banning pot and you know we've got to stop marijuana and illegal drugs. Meanwhile, cigarettes are killing way more people than everything else combined. Cancer, AIDS, fucking heroin, meth, coke, all that shit. Pull it all together with alcohol. It can't put a fucking dent. Not a scratch into what cigarettes kill every year. If they could figure out a way to make you want to hoard cigarettes for sure they would do it and the people hoarding it, they would give testimonials. I don't have a problem with it.

Speaker 2:          00:53:45       I enjoy my cigarette collection when I'm walking to the garage and I look at much. I like the smell, I get out there and we're not. I don't mean to sound like I'm smoking more. People kind of do that, but you're right, they do do that with scratch, but cigars are totally different. They liked like savor the taste and shit and it's like it makes no sense. No different cigars or different flavors to it. They taste. It tastes like shit to me. They all taste like you're sucking on a fucking. I Dunno a tree or something that I like them. I'll ask the guys. I think they taste good. Really? Yeah. When you have a fat steak and a glass of wine, you get a nice Cuban cigar with a fucking good taste to it. You know? It's just like you, you, you take it in and get a good taste in your mouth.

Speaker 2:          00:54:24       It's fun. Get you a little, gives you a buzz. Crazy thing. I don't like spliffs because you don't inhale cigars. You don't have to inhale through your mouth can you do if you're going to get high. Now I've been. The science between getting high is that once it hits your mouth, it's immediately and your stream. You don't even know. Is that true? Yeah. They, they. They did a study where it showed people that used to think were you supposed to inhale it and hold it in as long as you can. I guess supposedly you get 99 percent of the thc immediately when you. When you suck it twitter verse. Is this true? Because if this is true, I will stop smoking weed from now on and I'll just put it in my mouth. I'll just put on my off, take a deep breath and then blow it out. I always thought the people were doing that were like, Bill, I always thought that Bill Clinton did not inhale, but it's because he was crafty. He didn't know that. He knows how science. Is that real science? It is. Science is that real science twitter verse. What the fuck is that true? You don't. Let's keep our googling run. Love Google. Google right now. You do not have to inhale marijuana to get high

Speaker 4:          00:55:31       marijuana to get high. Yeah. I always thought you had to

Speaker 2:          00:55:37       hold in for the long thing to Wiki answers. What if you do not inhale marijuana? Answer? No. It has to go into your lungs to get you a high meaning. You have to inhale to get hot. Well, I'm not going to listen to this stupid fuck because this stupid fuck spelled high two different times and then wrote, have in capital letters. Not very scientific faggot. Next truck. Here's a trend. Do you have to inhale when smoking weed? Yahoo answers. Don't do it. Best Answer. Chosen by asking her. You fucking dummy. The girl says don't do it, but if you must know you have to keep this smoke in your loans longer than you normally would a cigarette, so you inhale it and then keep it in there for as long as you then exhale. That's not true. That's not true. It's just dumped to a don't do it. Why Alyssa? Because you don't want to have fun. Why should he not smoke the pot? Because he doesn't want to be friendly because he doesn't want to be more sensitive because you want it doesn't want to tune into the universe more. Shut the fuck up. Don't do it.

Speaker 2:          00:56:44       You can't tell me not smoke pot because I'm a goddamn comedian. And that's like telling a basketball player to not play with basketballs. Um, I can't find the answer.

Speaker 3:          00:56:57       Shit. I forget where I read it. I read it somewhere. It was like you read it the same way I place. I've read that gold is the same amount as we know now because I, I was on your side where that's bullshit in my girlfriend who is going to school for nursing. She's like, that's totally untrue. And then she showed me all these studies. I'm like, oh, okay. It was a, you have to. If she's watching get high.

Speaker 2:          00:57:19       Let's say this guys, you need to fully inhale and to get high. Take a big breath in.

Speaker 3:          00:57:26       See, these are people like fucking just like

Speaker 2:          00:57:29       you have to inhale, weeding your lungs get higher, won't do anything. We'd does not cause cancer. Okay. This guy's got a cancer article when our trunk is about you. Fuck. All right. We have no correct answer. Ladies and gentlemen, we tried. We cannot find the answer to this. Yahoo answers are all written by 16 year olds or 40 year old retards. One or the other. This guy says he knows everything about cannabis more than seven seconds or these yahoo answers. Yeah. We looked at those yahoo answers, man. That doesn't mean shit.

Speaker 3:          00:58:02       It's something about your. Your mouth is filled with a whatever the

Speaker 2:          00:58:08       makes sense because you don't inhale. I'm a tobacco smoke. When you smoke a cigar and you get high as fuck, you get really high from cigars. Cigars give you like a serious nicotine rush, like, whew, that's a good one. And if that's, if that happens, why wouldn't that happen with marijuana to you know, you don't inhale the cigar smoke. You take into your mouth and then you blow it out. You don't take a deep head of it like you do with cigarettes.

Speaker 3:          00:58:36       Yeah. That's a, that's a tough google search and I'll have to just actually find that. We don't know. We don't know. Ladies and gentlemen, it was a recent article that was about six months ago. I write it some people weed is not

Speaker 2:          00:58:46       for them. That really is true, you know, like standing hope doesn't like we'd stand will pay tweet, which doesn't make any sense because he likes everything else, but I think he probably got too high to get paranoid. If you get too high we will fucking rock your world, man. Shit makes you really.

Speaker 3:          00:59:03       The last year see I was and I was tripping my ass off. I almost had to run out. I was thinking like, okay, I am just going to leave and go to my room and take a nap.

Speaker 2:          00:59:11       Because I was trying to hard from we'd. Wow, this is this rivalry says opium trivia. The term are you hip comes from opium dens. You would lay on your side, on your hip and smoke. Hence the term. Are you hip? That kind of makes sense because if you ever watched like those old western movies are dudes are doing heroin or opium. The online on their side. Like what was that movie where Wyatt earp? Was it wider? One of those was buffalo bill or wider thing. It was. I don't remember who the fuck played them. Well remember, um, what was the moving where a doc holliday one was fucking Dennis Quaid played. Um, Dennis Quaid played Wyatt earp and Val kilmer played. Doc Holiday was the dopest doc holiday before Val kilmer just ate everything that, that existed. Val kilmer dissolve fat. Fucked up now. He was like, go back to top gun days.

Speaker 2:          01:00:11       Tombstone, tombstone. That's it. We go back to like val kilmer, like the old days val kilmer is a handsome motherfucker, you know? Yeah. You started hanging out with Tom Sizemore and you know, this whole weed thing. We could just fucking next time we're sober. Well, just try it. Ooh, okay. Leave. This guy says, red band is right. Arrowhead. Here we go. Robberies comes, comes clean our. Here we go. Read it to us. Okay, here it is. Mouse smoking cannabis. One of the primary health issues with cannabis is the effect of smuggled the lungs. While the risks from longterm cannabis smoking or not fully understood is assumed by. Before I do this, I will tell. I will take this copy, mount smoking is not as efficient as long smoking and requires approximately three times the material for the same level of effect, but for some people efficiency is not an issue.

Speaker 2:          01:01:03       I would say it's not an issue, you know, because we. It's not that expensive as we were talking about how it's worth a lot of money because. But it's not worth it. It's not that much. I mean it's one marijuana joint is like what is it, like $10 or something like that and probably wasn't. How much is a joint it joint? $10. $10. California joint will fast for sure. Fuck you out of your mind joining. Even if you're. Even if you smoke a lot, if you actually inhaled a full joint, you would be blitzkrieg, California weed, California Wade. So if you take California weed and you mouth mouth, fuck it. You could probably get by on like two hits of California weed from a joint and you're gone. And when. One of the things that you could do also is if you inhale it and you breathe it out your nose, so you, you put it in your mouth and then you blow it out your notes, but you're not going hailing it if it even increases it. Alright, well let's post this up online just so everybody knows what the fuck we're reading. Yeah. But I used to. I remember there was somebody I used to know that like smoke, she would only smoke with me, but she would say, I'm not going to inhale it, but I'll smoke it with you and make you feel better. I'm like, okay, so see if she would always get fucked up. And I'm like, wow, she's not stoned, but why is he acting so fucked up? So I look back at it now when she was locked up,

Speaker 2:          01:02:28       I just put that shit up online

Speaker 2:          01:02:32       so you can twitter that. They have a. So now we learned something ladies, gentlemen, rivalries, rivalries, you know, a lot of drugs, motherfucker. This is the dude. He runs the whole thing. It's says he, uh, he owns a pool hall in um, uh, somewhere in Georgia. Forget where it's from, make them make them Georgia, I believe, but it's a pretty famous pool hall. This guy owns it. Lights everything. Douche squad. There was a bunch of dudes with the Dishwasher, you know, some, some members of my board break off into little separate sex, like little gangs. I don't know what they're doing if you've never been to my message board. I got the craziest message board. I don't know how the fuck it happened. I don't know what caused it. But, uh, I've had this nutty message board since 1998 and right now there is more than two and a half million posts on it.

Speaker 4:          01:03:25       I'll put it up online.

Speaker 2:          01:03:33       I started smoking when I was 15 ray and uh, anyway, um, this message board, there's so much fucking nutty shit on that board. That's how I met Brian. I met Brian from the message board. It's really got a life of its own. I mean, it's got my name attached to it and I pay for it and to keep it running and you know, but there's like a bunch of different dudes who are cool people that I've met in real life, most of them that are the moderators on the board and you know, it's anything fucked up in the world. Anything weird, crazy, any nutty news. If you're looking for a video, like I heard this is a crazy video out, my board is going to happen for sure. Right? When you say that's, you know, it's a crazy place. It's pretty nutty ladies gentlemen. And on that note, it's fucking 5:36.

Speaker 2:          01:04:23       That's two hours, two and a half hours. We can't do more than two hours. Folks Boring. But we're at the Addison Texas Improv this weekend, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And I want to take a link right here, motherfucker. And I'm going to open this bitch and I'm going to put that on twitter so everybody knows what's up. Almost sold out. Yeah. It is very close to sold out. Like all the shows went about Houston, like Houston. People wondering if you're coming back to him coming back. We're right now trying to figure out whether we're doing the Improv or whether we're doing the house of Blues. There was a problem with the House of blues initially where they said the house of blues could not a seat. Everybody and I did not want to do a show where people have to stand and we talked about this before that we went to the Doug Stanhope show when he was in la and I love Doug, but I fucking can't stand and just watch a show for an hour and a half. It's hurts your feet. Your back starts hurting, your neck, gets cramped up, and then I realized like this is uncomfortable. Sitting and watching a show is awesome, but standing and watching a show sucks. It gets annoying.

Speaker 3:          01:05:22       Not a big fan of the house of Blues. I wanted to see a concert last week and I had a horrible experience with those fuckers with House of Blues. Which one though? They went on sunset. What happened? Uh, when you go through, they stamp your hands. They quit wristbands on. They check your ids. They scan the tickets, right, so we went up there and it was general admission. We found a place that we wanted to like sit and stay lean up against the wall. It was perfect for the concert. Halfway through the opening, a act or whatever, opening band, security grabbed my girlfriend coming out of the bathroom goes, where's your hand stamp? And she goes, oh, I don't know, maybe it washed off. I have a wristband. Here's my ticket. She goes, no, your hands not stamped. You're Outta here. And she's like, well, I have my ticket right here.

Speaker 3:          01:06:07       He goes, I don't care. He's going to have a hand stamp. She goes, my boyfriend's right there. He goes, go get him. And he's kicked out too. Like it was like, it was like, what are you? Okay, but that's just la douchebag. A manager got involved. Right? But that has nothing to do with Houston, Texas or a company dickheads. He's like, sorry, corporate policy, you're supposed to get hand stamped. I'm like, it doesn't matter. I'm in here. I have tickets with a fucking manager. He goes, I'm sorry, but let's go downstairs, which get your hand stamp and let's figure this out together. I'm like the concerts on right now. It's just like the biggest fucking corporate bullshit. You know? That shit wouldn't happen at fucking Improv. You don't think so? No. You don't have your hand stamped. You have a ticket. Come on.

Speaker 2:          01:06:48       So you think that death. So what happened then you think would not happen. So you think that if we have a show at the house of Blues, people might get fucked.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       My problem with the House of Blues, it's a corporate thing, the whole not being able to make great fucking time at all. The House of Blues. Well you have anytime when you're out in front of a, a good crowd of people, right? Yeah, but that's one of the few venues where you guarantee that everything's going to run smoothly. You know, they get rid of douchebags in the audience to record your own. Say That is true. Now that fans aren't allowed to bring cameras into the place or they have to leave them at the box on.

Speaker 2:          01:07:18       Well, the problem with that, as these motherfuckers want to stick cameras in your face while you're on stage, constantly record things and put them on youtube, they're going to do that with various very district going to do that regardless of what it is annoying for them and for the bands and for different people. I feel like you don't want their stuff pirated. They're just protecting the artists. That make sense to me. I agree, but it's not a bad experience. But I think he had isolated Douche bags. I mean people that run the House of Blues and I'm in Vegas are fucking awesome. The those people are super cool and that's the one we go to the most. Yeah. House of Blues and San Diego. Then we also knew it wasn't performance side night a customers. That's true. I've never heard any complaints. So if you guys have had complaints about the house of Blues, let a Nigga know. You know I need to. I need to hear that shit. Maybe Dan Ackroyd's house of Blues in Connecticut at the Mohegan Sun deal fell through gigantic fail. Why don't I read that? You fucking

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       motherfucker house of Blues charges a buttload that is true. They have a lot of built in costs. It costs. I get paid the same amount to do a 300 seat room in Vegas as I do to do the house of Blues, which is like 900 seats, which is pretty crazy. Yeah. That's kind of fucked up because they have all these built in. Um, they have built in costs

Speaker 3:          01:08:37       in pockets. Oh Shit. Built in pockets in their prices. That's another thing. The prices were ridiculous. Like a bud light with six bucks or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:08:47       Is it really? Where is it? What is it? Most bars,

Speaker 3:          01:08:50       but like, usually, I mean outside of Los Angeles, usually it's like three bucks, two bucks for a bud light outside of Los Angeles. Los Angeles. Under five hours at least.

Speaker 1:          01:09:01       Easily. Okay. Well someone just fucking bitch slap rivalries. BBJ Joan says that Shit, we said about hip. The opium dens. He says the actual

Speaker 4:          01:09:11       or is

Speaker 1:          01:09:14       two and the answer of A. Are you hip being opium dens lying on? He says it's not true. It's not true. It says, to ingenious, too convoluted and too silly, is wiki 44, but that's Wiki. This is his opinion is often a great deal of uncertainty and tracking word origins since we have written worked record going phrase may have been in common use long before anybody wrote it down after all, one doesn't use slang phrases in most writing, such as newspaper, a certain competence accepted. They should use slang and everything. So talk while we pretend to not talk the way we talk, I always thought that like writing professionally, like when I write my blogs, I read exactly the way I talk. I'm just like, I wrote an open letter to Kellogg's, which more or less I did as a writing exercise. I was writing every day. I'm from month to month.

Speaker 1:          01:10:02       My Spike TV special was being recorded. So I wrote down, I wrote my material out every day. Uh, I wrote not wrote down material. I wrote new blogs every day and you know, I just needed to shit to write about. And one of them was this Kellogg's banning Michael Phelps because he smoked weed because I wrote this open letter and I wrote it. The way I talk with swears and just the way I normally talk people look, they're going to read that open letter. Like I didn't want him to read a stupid. I'm just writing. It doesn't. You could read it or you don't read it, but I'm not gonna write something you to have more impact. Just like they're going to listen. They're going to listen to a fucking pothead, comedian slash cage fighting commentator like Kellogg's is gonna make their decisions based on that. No, it's for you guys. It's for humor. It's for entertainment. Does the word hip really hit heal from a west African language? It could be either or though this, this. I mean it could be that, that the, the original hip that rivalries talks about is right. I mean there's, I mean if, if there's no real.

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       If the origins of it are or are murky, it could. It could be both. They're just not saying anything to discredit that

Speaker 4:          01:11:09       anyone who gives a fuck

Speaker 1:          01:11:11       red band is totally right about the Oh, is he really, truly right?

Speaker 3:          01:11:17       I am telling her I. No, no, it's a fucking taste thing. I think cigarettes are disgusting and you're sucking on them everyday because you wouldn't think they're discussing if you smoke them for when. You're totally right about that. You're right. If I was a junkie, I wouldn't think they're just kind of stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:11:32       This guy had a shitty experience at the Anaheim House of Blues. Same deal as red band, except they had to make me restate my hand and I lost my stool.

Speaker 3:          01:11:41       Exactly. That's what happened to me. I lost my store and almost got in a fight with a bunch of Persians and the guy felt bad. I felt bad and Kevin buying me a bad tequila on night and next thing I know, I was like, Bro, alright. Oh wait, isn't that are called the compressions? Iranians. Yeah, but they're. They don't want to be caught. Not. They don't want to be confused with Irene Irania here. Iranian talk about the fights at 1:10. It was

Speaker 1:          01:12:08       fucking awesome. Cain Velasquez, the guy's a legend. He's. He's going to go down in history as one of the greatest ever. I think that that was just some stellar shit. Cain Velasquez going to be him against Brock Lesnar was going to be insane. I want to see him against fate or really I would love to see Cain Velasquez against fader. I think every time cane fights it gets better. You know, the heavyweight division is a motherfucker right now, Shane car wound versus Frank Meir and Brock Lesnar is going to fight the winter and you know, who knows what the fuck is ever going to happen to fate or fate or ever gets to the UFC. The fucking universe might collapse. It might be insane. All Right Ladies and gentlemen, we've had a long ass show at 5:44. So that means even with our downtime, we did like an hour and 20 minutes at least maybe an hour and a half. Love Ya. Thanks for tuning in Addison, Texas this weekend, next week or early next week. Uh Oh, Canada. I'm in Canada next week. Shazamm bitches. I'm in Toronto. I'm in a couple other places. I don't know what the fuck I am, but we'll talk about that shit next week. Thank you very much for tuning in. I love you bitches. And um, that's it. All right. I got to find out how to end this. It would've been cooler if I figured out a way to say thank you. I love you. Shut up. Bye.
